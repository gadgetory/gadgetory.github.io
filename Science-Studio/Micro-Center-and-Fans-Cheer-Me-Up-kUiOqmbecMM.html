Micra Center I have some things to take
care of including returning the 69
hundred K after taking a bit of a loss
with both of my editing rigs prior to
filming this video I'm going to need
some cash so I'm gonna get a lot of that
back from this so I think a thousand and
eighty three bucks including tax
I'll get back from this one and then
we'll probably buy a 68 hundred K or a
5820k depending on which one they have
I'm pretty sure they have sixty hundred
K but I don't know about the 5820 if
they have that for 320 it's an 80 dollar
discount I think I'll do that instead of
the 6800 k so others have come out too
to be here yeah you got to introduce
yourself your name is Jonathan thanks
Miguel let me go
cool so we're just going to go ahead and
return this and shop so return the 69
hundred K and I think I'm gonna buy a
5820k against the majority of you told
me to buy the 6800 k I think I can
overclock the 5820k just a bit more and
that'll boost our single core
performance make up for that small
difference and I'll probably buy a next
99 board too so that I can get an
editing rig up and running by the end of
tonight so we're on the motherboard
section apparently they're pretty cool
with this filming because some of us
some of them knew knew me from the other
video so we're just going to be pretty
open about it until somebody says
something let's go that's it I got it
that's what we'll get who they picked up
a second 6950 egg I think when they
thought I was going to purchase that
when they made up for it in stock okay
so we know we're going to get that and
we're going to get 30 bucks off for the
motherboard CPU combo discount so let's
try to get something that matches the
rest of the component this is an option
as well
I like crates 239
that would look so sick wouldn't it look
so sick yeah so this is the it's a
silverish it's more of a silver colored
x99 motherboard but I still think it
would look great in Walter white version
3.0 what do you think 400 bucks for this
you don't mind being in the video
cool man 400 bucks or I could get an SLI
crate for 239 a crate yeah
missing same let's open box I'm a fan of
open box long as I tested it I'm good
with that 50% off on clearance are you
serious that's a great oh wow are you
serious yeah dude come get this oh wow
take an extra 50% off any clearance
motherboard look what we just found that
x99 crate motherboard for 224 dollars
we're gonna get that for 120 bucks
x9 on board oh wow
yeah this is full number this alright
let's go look for power supplies now
this is a this is the tempting oil here
I have to I have to leave this out I
will spend unnecessary funds in this
aisle
oh no okay
all right I'm looking for around 800
watts anything over that that I can get
at a discount would be would be best
okay I don't have a 350 dollar budget on
a power supply this isn't bad
850 BQ for 100 bucks this decent price
yeah and I have be quiet sending another
thousand watts so worst case I'll just
replace that one with the thousand won
and then I'll put that in like my z170
ray which that'll sip on power so I
think we'll get the 850 BQ
that's a good price this is a the best
price that we could find for what you're
getting from a reliable brand like EVGA
yes I took a lot of your dice giving me
crap about my deep cool psu alright so
again we revisit the cooler master aisle
here all of their excellent coolers that
are very cheap hyper t44 14.99 you know
what I'm going to do pick one up on
principle folks you see a deal like that
you take advantage of it it's actually
not bad this is probably like the best
bang for your buck literally the best
bang for your buck well we should
probably go ahead and take this one off
the shelf yes sir yeah can I go ahead
and get a 5820k son to the front yes
yes so those are three 20 correct yes
sir okay awesome pencil dude you guys
have a killer killer deal on your
clearance on your open bucks
motherboards a bit little could we stop
doing it and then we stop back in doing
the 50% out that's awesome that's a
really I mean this look at that for $115
or the person is what 223 no in a second
but we don't take off that's insane
that's crazy now one thing I know I
can't check because it's got the
security thing on there but I want to
make sure that it comes with the i/o
shield I'll open another big that is
that cool okay yeah I just want to
double check on that oh yeah I'm gonna
open it up okay cool there try on sir 40
bucks
yeah it's pretty good price for a
solid-state drive I mean that's that's
right in line with Amazon and Newegg
give you what I want to say competitive
oh yeah oh you guys are more than
competitive especially when it comes
without snow but your cpu prices by far
okay good i/o shield that's awesome oh
cool
yeah that was that was my main concern
even think about the pins and all that
but that is that's something I would
like to check on appreciate that but
myself but no problem
I have a lot of white parts so the white
the white theme will really work out
okay okay gonna get really close on it
looks good yeah
so that and it comes with an IO plate
that was those are the two concerns I
had and checks out so we're gonna get
this board for a really great price rid
of the great price awesome I mean
excellent e92 get one on new egg or
Amazon you're at least paying 180
hundred ninety bucks
see this is what you got to pay
attention to right here $14.99 after
mail-in rebate I missed that I missed
that
so I'm not going to wait three months
for that money to get here bra bra bra
great oh I'm playing that all day and
then games that have really really high
frame rates and you would see it even
more what's up hey hi I'm Greg poison
Channel cool man cool nice to meet you
you returned you're just this fixing my
house this big yeah so I have it sitting
all this is a 5820k over there Oh fifty
are you decided to go with the busy
exonic oh yeah I'm going with the silent
majority okay either they're minority
because eighty bucks cheaper than the
than the sixty-eight hundred K but what
I'm going to do is use that money that
I've gotten back to rebuild the system
that uh okay cool
let's christian do for five bucks on the
bus for ten bucks whatever it even if it
comes out a little slightly higher or
lower sees right here $40 savings when
bundled with a compatible processor so I
would actually come in there's a ten
dollar Mellon rebate that's what brings
it down to $4.99 you have it's it's
$54.99 in-store you get twenty $40
bundle savings with purchase of a AMD
processor and then you get an additional
$10 rebate on this one that's how it
gets out of the four nine that make
sense so without the rebate it's $14.99
if I bundle with the processor great
like a look at processors it's good I'll
check it out
yeah then I guess prices tank even more
yet epochs 6380 300 yep if you're gonna
go with 6300 then yeah I might as well
is exactly two more cores four more
modules yeah that's good that's the
exact same when we bought Jacob and lo
at lower powers like 11 yeah that's true
ext grade that's true
90 bucks 90 bucks plus 1500 five bucks I
got already got ram ddr3 yeah graphics
cards I got everything for ya
let's go and do that - lets get the 8383
20 all right what we got in our our back
our buggy that's increasing in size
what's inside of it let's see one of
these for 40 bucks just because I think
it's good to have one just laying around
5820k
for 320 bucks 120 dollar x99 crate
motherboard from MSI I think that's our
best deal of the day here's a surprise
an 83 20 e for 90 bucks and the reason
why I'm buying that is because we got
this board combo'd up with it for like
$15 so why not it'll be a ring for the
camera man yeah Kyle it's gonna be
another McLovin all over again
and then we have an 8 850 BQ power
supply from EVGA this is what I'll use
in my opinion weak for now and when the
be quiet PSU comes here is delivered
I'll swap that out with this one and
then I'll use this one probably and as
you 170 build I think that's that's what
we're going to do so we're gonna go
ahead check out before I spend any more
money because that's just the nature of
the beast here at micro Center and make
the drive home yeah I got ya
that's a pre discount pre discount iPad
is 50% yeah for these and then this one
was $39.99 on the on the board back
there instead of 40 $6.99
well as usual I walked out of Micro
Center with more in my hand and I
expected to come out with I spent about
750 bucks this time but I ended up
making $250 in the sense that I returned
$1,000 chips so that's nice and I can
practically build two entire rigs with
what I have in my hand so we'll get back
we'll do a PC build or two and then I
guess I guess those are the first two
videos we'll take care of and then maybe
I'll do the new egg or the maybe I'll do
the Micro Center video after that so
Kyle thanks for coming out with me I'm
going to leave you here I'm gonna go
ahead and drive home good luck catch
your flight before taxi sit area you
know what we thought about that we
thought about just bunking here for the
night you know it's weekend we're not
school tomorrow and we thought about
just staying right there but then I said
well no because then I'm going to end up
with this many bags again tomorrow I
can't help myself folks okay so let's go
get something to eat look at the birds
so many birds what is this Zubin cow
look at all these chickens what is this

geomagnetic disturbance aliens and you
