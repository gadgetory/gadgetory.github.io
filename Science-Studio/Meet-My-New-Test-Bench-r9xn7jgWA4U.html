this is meet the thermaltake Corp III
snow edition a fully modular wall
mountable chassis with dedicated support
from ITX to ATX form factors across the
spectrum it'll even fit motherboards
larger than that but if you're aiming
for a more mainstream build you can fit
so much into this case it's also very
modular as you'll see here shortly
for instance the P 3s include optional
riser cards and modular PCIe slots that
can be oriented vertically or
horizontally
additionally ITX builds allow for the
PSU to be turned fans side out useful
especially if you've got flashy RGB
functionality built in this thermaltake
tough power grand se power supply is an
excellent combination of efficiency
reliability and customizability its tier
2 80 plus gold rated and fully modular
as well a button on the back allows you
to switch between several pre-programmed
color combinations the same goes for the
360 millimeter AIO thermal take sent
over as well is number as much RGB as
possible and they definitely delivered
this red is not only huge but fitted
with three 120 millimeter ring fans
that's two eyes packing full RGB
potential however the controller
included with the kit does not come with
a wireless remote meaning you have to
place it somewhere accessible if you
expect to change the color scheme often
the radiator combo pushes my 6700 K to
4.7 gigahertz at 1.32 volts temperatures
after about 30 minutes of out of 64 peg
75 C so nothing too crazy with the right
fan curve pump and fin density this one
will outperform a crack in X 62 hands
down and for about the same price
granted this one is significantly longer
now because this case will be my test
bench for the foreseeable future I
decided to opt for a platform that more
of you will have that's more mainstream
that's why I went with the 6700 K
instead of an X 99 CPU it's still very
overclockable compatible with zi1 and
zi2 70 motherboards and will not murder
your wallet as quickly as its higher
core counterparts will the motherboard
is as rocks very own Z 270 killer
hence the large K spanning the entire
board and I must say I'm thrilled
they've included these unique accents
they seem to span the entire new lineup
of Intel boards expect the same from
asrock in the case of a m4
16 gigabytes of
group ddr4 silver to match the silver
and well okay this is weird it's a 4
gigabyte AMD r9 380 that's right a 300
series AMD GPU until my two 1080s
arrived for my custom water loot build
that's coming very soon by the way I'm
not willing to part with the 10 70s in
Heisenberg and this thing is an absolute
steal on line 120 US dollars check eBay
and other retailers just temporary this
is a test bench after all so any
component is subject to change and be
tested here so you're probably wondering
at this point why I chose the thermal
take a Corp III as my test bench because
that's not what it was intended for
right well it's an open air case as our
most test benches but unlike most of
those the p3 includes proper radiator
mounting plenty of clean cable
management space via the back door and a
super clean aesthetic especially with
the acrylic window in place for my
purposes however I don't expect I'll
have this window on for very long
the metallic posts that hold it in place
though are extremely heavy and sturdy
you can lift the entire PC by these
handles here it's perfectly fine but are
also completely removable as is most of
the cases structure cable guiding
cutouts and rubber grounded sleeves wrap
around the motherboard standoffs and
support for up to a 420 m120 support for
up to 420 millimeter AIO is available so
what do I not like about the case well
not much Thermaltake kind of nails in
here I do wish the cable cut out toward
the bottom of higher up but I'm aware
that they want support for extended
units completely fine separate glass
would be a nice alternative to acrylic
and I'm told of that version is in the
work so no harm there either I don't
like the fact that there's no slot for
the rear i/o shield that is admittedly a
bit weird I don't see any harm in
including one but at this point I really
feel like I'm just being picky
everything was beautifully thought
through it just so happens they're not
all of its design choices complement
this build factor here it's a trade off
of being universally supported so can it
really be called a case if it's open-air
I really think so it supports everything
a case would and includes a removable
back panel for hard drive and SSD
support cable storage and excess
peripherals it just doesn't have sides
that's really it but that's ok this case
isn't for everyone but it's for me and
my
NEADS and I wouldn't change a thing
about it you can find links to all parts
featured here in this video's
description by the way I think these
components from thermaltake make for an
excellent test bench what do you think
