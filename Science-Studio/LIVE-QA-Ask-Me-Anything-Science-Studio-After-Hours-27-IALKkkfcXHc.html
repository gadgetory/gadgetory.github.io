watching myself right now on my laptop
and this is kind of like a makeshift
thing I'm experimenting you guys are my
guinea pigs so right now I'm running a
1080p stream at a 30,000 kilobit per
second bitrate which I can hear myself
which is much higher than it should be I
wanted to make sure that that I could
hear myself decently in the laptop so if
anybody says that I'm a little too quiet
I can adjust because I can actually hear
myself now I know that this isn't the
typical format obviously I'm in the new
studio now and that is something that
has been going for the past a week or
two so if you've been wondering why
content is slowed down that is a big
part of it also the hurricane down here
slowed a lot of things up especially for
my family my parents so we've been
helping them at their house they're
actually over here right now so here's
some weird stuff in the background
that's probably them because their house
is basically unlivable
so trying to a get all s squared away
and again will also slow down content
now if I'm a little too quiet let me
know again if I need to adjust the audio
I'm running the same setup that I
typically run when I film a you know a
regular video that I'll edit in post for
the channel so if you need any you know
if you need to throw something at me let
me know that I am too quiet or the
cameras going out of focus or something
Crazy's goin on please let me know
because all I can really see it myself
with that 20 or 30 second delay so we'll
see and also if you like the way things
look if you think it looks pretty that's
because I'm using the camera that I
always used to film with my primary
camera that's the sony a7s - i have that
wired directly into an avro media
capture card excuse me I could totally
run 4k off this thing if I wanted but my
capture card doesn't support 4k and I'm
too cheap to buy an elgato 4k 60 capture
card so maybe how I'll invest in one at
some point but I imagine that most
people aren't going to be able to handle
a 4k 60fps stream this camera doesn't
even support 4k 60 it's only 4k 30 so it
would be upsampled to 4k 60 also
realized that part of
part of the donation window is how to
sink in one sec let's see if we can fix
that good editor that's weird it's
showing that it's in picture no no I'll
leave it like that for now at least on
on my window it's showing that it's
slightly off camera I'm also watching
again I'm watching the stream live so
I'm gonna have to see how all that works
out thank you for the for the mentions
yeah I know the audio is probably gonna
be slightly behind I get that of
something else I wanted to experiment
with that's something that secret Kate
Creed just said and that's again because
I'm running the audio through the camera
now the camera actually is a really good
preamp so it's it's you know not gonna
sound too fuzzy it won't sound too
distorted
actually all the audio that you hear
that you have heard in the past 50 or
some videos that I've recorded on the
a7s2
has been run directly through the camera
I haven't used really I mean I have a
phantom power box but it's from Pyle but
the audio is sampled straight into the
camera so I don't have to do any of that
you know splicing and trying to overlap
my recorded audio with the audio that I
hear recorded by the camera this is all
straight simple forward it keeps things
nice and easy for me and post also I you
know it doesn't sound too bad so
considering it's a camera again this
isn't meant for like you know hardcore
audio recording I'd say it's pretty good
considering I only have like a cheap 50
$50 so phantom power box from pile here
running so anyway let's get to some more
questions I saw I saw a super jet from
bazinga bazinga is always in the chat if
he's not a modding needs to be modeling
double check make sure you he is yeah
he's got he's got mod status like a boss
he gave $50 super check my dude I
appreciate that I know they appreciate
it but we want to make sure that we
don't this this nothing that I'm doing
on this channel is for that reason and
my parents are good they're covered in
insurance all that good stuff I don't
want to talk too much about it
the time or place for it but I do
appreciate your support anybody who saw
that video notice the whole city pretty
much was wiped out we were spared over
here it's crazy how 20 miles or so it
makes all the difference with the wind
patterns and just how intense storms
like that can get so yeah now let's see
here I'm gonna screw up just a little
bit I see a bunch of I'm talking between
you guys I like seeing that so if I
don't answer your question maybe
somebody else knows answer your question
because there are a lot of questions
usually so we're gonna get right into it
I want to start with let's see here this
is good okay okay this is a good
question Owen Gish what price should I
pay for a used 10 atti good question
so like I'm gonna do this I never buy a
graphics card unless I know it's a
killer deal used anyway because if it's
if it's not that great a deal you might
as well just spend the extra 40 or 50
bucks to get the brand-new item because
then you get the warranty and peace of
mind you know you know it's a brand new
item so you're not gonna have issues
unless there's some kind of manufacturer
defect which is always gonna be covered
under warranty so what I typically do is
look for something that's around half
price if I can get near half price maybe
bump it up to about 60 or 65% of MSRP I
won't pay more than 78% of MSRP for a
used product by that point I'll just buy
the new thing unless it's something huge
like a car or whatever I think when you
buy a car there are several other things
to consider computer components don't
typically depreciate as quickly as cars
do in that respect right you drive a car
for 10 minutes brand new and it's
already depreciated 5% so cars are
different I think buying a new car it's
very difficult to rationalize that I
think that certified pre-owned is
probably the best way to go usually get
better warranties with though that's
what I did with my Infiniti and I mean
even just used in general typically the
cars already depreciated enough and if
you do the checkups and stuff make sure
the car wrecks runs good if you know
you're looking at if you don't hire a
mechanic to do that for you then you're
gonna be a-ok
computer parts a little different you
never know really what was going on
behind the scenes that car could have
been running mining 24/7 a lot of miners
don't run 24/7 but you get the point and
if they're running very hot people get
concern about longevity and it's very
difficult to gauge but I would say I can
comfortably say of the ten or so cards
that I just bought on eBay over the last
month all of them work just fine that
some of them are very dusty but that's
really the extent of it so to answer
your question
attending to Ti I wouldn't pay any more
than about 450 maybe 500 bucks for
that's pushing it again that's usually
around that 70% cap of MSRP if I could
find a 1080i for between 400 and 450 in
that price range that's a steal anything
higher than that and I think you're
starting to get into that 78% territory
worried you might as well if you're
gonna spend that much money buy a new
one because you can get exactly what you
want and again you're gonna have that
warranty no matter what and you're gonna
know exactly what happened to it because
it was just put in a box you know
there's nothing else it that happened to
it
and you know people have issues trusting
other people with hardware I totally get
that
it's like loaning your car out to
somebody it's always a little sketchy
even if it's a family member so that's
something else to consider there Jason
Acevedo Canadian fabbed out a super chat
appreciate that man dude what CPU should
I get for 165 Hertz 1440p gaming it's a
good question I have a 1080i taking you
to account the soon-to-be-released 9
chen from intel ok so i can't really
comment on the 9 genital stuff not only
would I be under NDA if I had that stuff
and I've already tested it but also I
don't have any of that stuff I can't
tell you firsthand I will say that for
that kind of refresh rate right that 165
FPS cap that you're gonna have is going
to stress your CPU a lot more than say
60 Hertz for cake and that's like purely
graphics card at that point but when you
start venturing into the 100-plus FPS
territory you're gonna put a lot more of
that leverage on your CPU and that's why
I would recommend at least a hexa-core
so if you could stick to the 80 600 K
would be a decent option the 80 700 K
obviously is a really good option you
combine some
just once for you know around two to two
fifties or hang really good deals you
could yet a 2600 or 2600 X from risin I
think those are really good values if
you're willing to buy a used 8700 K I
would say you're almost just as good
getting a regular 2600 or a 2600 X for
around the same price because you know
those again are brand new and they're
going to work and most CPUs aren't
randomly gonna die anyway but having
that peace of mind again that's
something people are willing to pay
extra for and I'm not gonna knock you
for it if that's something that is just
your prerogative then sure please by all
means do that so that's something else
that I'm sure a lot of people weigh but
in general I would say stick to six
cores or more at this point for a high
refresh rate system so if you have a 165
Hertz or 144 Hertz or 120 Hertz monitor
six cores and 2018 is pretty much gonna
keep you in the green I would say for
the next three or four years I would be
surprised if anything higher than that
was required for that kind of refresh
rate in modern games okay scrolling down
let's see here
yeah also I keep looking at the I'm
checking the camera because I wanna make
sure that it looks okay this looks a lot
better than streaming from that Logitech
920 C 920 that was called that's the one
everyone has but I figured I would give
it a shot and see how long the cameras
actually I don't have a camera wired
directly into the wall so the batteries
might die and in in the event that
happens I will quickly swap them out and
we'll get back to business so the camera
feed might cut out and the audio will
cut out but I'll fix it within a minute
and we should be good to go again so
until I get that wire that runs directly
into the camera I'm gonna be running off
of battery and the a7s2 chews through
batteries not only because they're so
small because cameras just it's a
resource hog let's see here dolphin ight
what is the first thing to upgrade in
your setup if you already have good
peripherals and a great PC I mean all
right if you have a hole in your pocket
and there are plenty of things you could
potentially spend money on
I don't know if you want me to talk
about other peripherals or about things
in your system I don't know what you
have in your systems kind of a question
but you could work on lighting like I
would totally trick out my setup I would
put like LED strips all the way around
my desk and make it look all cool we
could get sound damping foam if you want
I buy a bunch of posters you know get
some thin shelves you could put on top
of your around your desk you know on the
top I would say somewhere he hasn't run
pointing like just above the damping
foam behind me would be a cool place for
debt for a shelving so you can put some
stuff up there it seems to be like the
way people check out their setups now if
you want to go internal like I would
totally step it up like build a second
system you know go heart of your
hardcore and and build like a streaming
system inside of like a hardcore gaming
rig that would be really cool you could
do it with the fan text involve X you
could do that with a couple of systems
that are obviously going to cost you
more more money and then a regular
single PC bill but that's just something
a little out of the box you can brag and
say here there are two systems in here
if you have again the money to spend but
I don't think you'll need to Henri
Lanfear why did you sell your s5 one
because I think I got a better car and
return I had to pay more for it but I
think my car that I have now it's not
only faster but it's it's nicer on the
interior I think it looks just as good
it doesn't have the Audi Flair but I
think it still has a nice aggressive
stance I miss all wheel drive that's
something I do miss about the s5 but
again I do love the power this car is
400 horsepower and sometimes it's higher
than 400 to the wheels these red sports
are kind of all over the place but I
sold it because of that I also sold it
because I wasn't sure I just you know if
something happened with the timing
chains and two timing chain Tencent
attention errs gosh oh my god they're
made out of plastic
reinforced plastic they used to be
really bad on the older four point two
and three point to use those deficit
engines had terrible wear and tear
issues with respect to the timing chain
tensioners and that's an n-channel
service because the timing chains in
those cars are against the firewall and
you can't get to that obviously without
pulling the whole engine out and
attaching the transmission so that's an
easily 8 to 10 grand grand job you know
from four grand just for labor five
inches really
so I was a little worried about that I
didn't have a warranty on the car the
car that I have now though has an insane
warranty ten years 100k miles I'll never
touch that warranty like I'll never even
come close to Brie I'll probably sell
the car way before 10 years and I'll
never come close to driving 100k miles
on the road but that car because it
never dries it always sits in the garage
so I think that's just the best peace of
mind possible again I got a faster car
and return as well and I did have to
basically traded my s5 in for so I had
to finance the difference I think
financing is just a better option for me
because it allows me to keep more money
in the bank so if I need to spend that
money on anything else you know
emergency wise whatever we get hit by
Hurricane right and unexpected expenses
I would like to have that money safe and
sound in my savings account rather than
invested in a car which will then
require me to liquidate it and get the
funds then which is no other hassle so
yeah that's my take on it and that's
just in a nutshell why I sold the car it
was a great car though definitely I do
recommend it I would probably end up
buying it again I might buy the the B
eight-point-five s5 but I still like
that style of coupe and that's again why
I bought the q6 TRS cuz it's also a
coupe and it's got that same sporty feel
to it let's see here
- obelisk kit you know - obelisk -
that's his name
okay would you change at any DTI into a
2080 TI the only instance in which I
would justify that change is if I
expected to game at a resolution 4k or
higher and I wanted to refresh rate
higher than 60 Hertz because right now
attending to T I can't it usually can
handle 4k 60 and no high ish settings it
really depends on the game I would say
under 90 to 95% of circumstances you can
play in 4k with high to very high
settings and be comfortably within that
60 Hertz boundary but if you go higher
than that that's gonna require more
graphical horsepower again that's gonna
put more leverage on your CPU as well
but I assume you have your CPU in check
because you're willing to spend that
much in a 10-8 did she had to begin with
so if you want to drop 1200 bucks on a
20 DTI then you better have a good
reason for doing it and that reason in
my opinion is only if you're playing in
4k or higher maybe you have 3 4k screens
you wanna ball up 20 DT I would be
better for the
and then again a higher-resolution
excuse me a higher refresh rate than 4k
that again is gonna leverage your CPU
more but it will require you graphics
card to keep up as well and especially
geez they required bandwidth for that 4k
120 Hertz is an insane amount of
bandwidth so that's another reason why I
don't really recommend it and longer
because not many people are playing in
this higher resolutions like ultra
stretch 4k and stuff like that it's just
a little too out of reach for the
average consumer I think okay Sebastian
Torres do you think a 790 metre 20xx
NVIDIA refresh will happen next year no
I don't think I don't think it'll be
called that if it's seven nanometer 20xx
I don't think it'll be called it won't
be in the twenty Series put it that way
well I think a better question sebastian
is whether or not we will see the 2060
or the 2050 coming out soon right
because they're gonna delay the 2017
launch and the reason why companies do
that is because they say well this card
is cheaper it's probably you know we're
gonna be purchased more often so we're
going to delay that launch in order to
saturate sales with our higher-end cards
but it's purely a marketing play and
they're doing it because they want to
make the sale right on the more
expensive cards first and once they hit
their quotas or when they expect to hit
their quotas they then push out the
cheaper cards because those are going to
sell like hotcakes because they are more
affordable the 2016 to 2050 whatever
they end up being we don't know even if
they may not even be released I haven't
heard much of anything in regards to
those new cards but what I will say is
that I don't think the architectural
play is going to be similar or identical
to the 2070 2080 20 TI it doesn't make
sense for me for a 20 60 equivalent to
have arti cores to me it just defeats
the purpose I don't think the cards
gonna be powerful enough from a CUDA
perspective to support the RT you know
architecture like the the RT cores a
tensor core is all that built into it to
me it seems like a waste of time it's
like putting a really fast car and
really cheap wheels so I think if NVIDIA
does something like this it will maybe
they'll revive the volta architecture or
they will take the
the you know Turing architecture and
they'll dumb it down a lot maybe they'll
remove our tea cores they'll remove
tensor cores and they'll they'll keep it
cheaper by doing that so they'll
completely redesign the the die but then
that's not really Turing architecture so
I don't really know what they're gonna
do
I'm curious to know what you guys think
about that because we haven't heard very
much about it so yeah good question
though okay Andrew Stein would you buy a
2700 X 8700 K or wait for 9900 K for
1440p gaming at 144 Hertz software
development a ton of multitasking okay
so good question I think 144 hurts the
8700 K and the 2700 X can both handle
that refresh rate admirably so if you're
looking at it just from that perspective
there make it makes no sense to me to
wait I I would buy frankly either one
you could get by with the 27 2700 X
really would be that would be great
8700 be slightly better from a gaming
perspective but I think that 2,700 X has
the edge when it comes to just
straight-up raw horsepower computational
power under this two extra cores for
extra threads and with better memory
overclocking support right which is tied
directly to the Infinity fabric which
speeds up the entire rise in process the
2,700 X is a very formidable chip in
2018 so I'm not gonna take anything away
from Intel they're still they still have
the gaming King as of right now and the
9900 K looks to be the new gaming king
but again it's gonna cost you a pretty
penny and if you can find the 2700 X for
cheaper than that it's tough it's tough
to really say what the cutoff would be
for me but if I was choosing a system
for an all-around great multitasker
software development assuming that they
aren't Intel dependent software's then I
would say the 2700 X is the better bet
from Strictly gaming perspectives the
8700 K is the better bet so if you're
going to do more of the development
multitasking side of things 2,700 X is
your best bet again assuming those
things aren't Intel dependent that the
software you're gonna be using let's see

Adam Stephenson says stop thoughts on
bit wits latest video I saw the title I
actually saw it right before I set up
the livestream so I didn't have time to
watch
yet but I love it when Lyle gets into
those videos so I'll definitely be
watching it after this because I'm
always up for a laugh especially on days
like today so I will be sure to watch it
immediately after this and I'm sure I'll
say something on Twitter or in the
discord server about it at some point
okay let's see here
I think I missed I'm again missing
you're missing a $10 super chat again I
appreciated my duty so this is for you
where is Pepsi are you sure you will not
exceed 100k miles once Lisa gets here
once Lisa gets her hands on the car
that's a good that's a good point
so this this is my take on it
ish when she movies here I told her I
was like okay I'll buy you a Jeep or
I'll buy you something I'll buy you some
bigger car that you can take off road
you can drive on to the beach and all
this good stuff plus the perks for taxes
I can write off a bigger car it's better
and send it for me so I'll end up
probably making that the company car
which is what it will essentially be
we'll do a lot of moving equipment back
and forth with that vehicle so it will
be I think a better investment to get a
bigger car for her and that's great
because she wants a bigger car anyway
it's gonna be 4x4 it's got to be for
what she wants to do and then we'll
leave the q60 for just general driving
whenever I'm comfortable enough parking
it next to somebody else that's when
we'll be using it but a good question
also Pepsi is in the other room she's
probably hiding on top of her a little
trap house that we built her because the
dogs are over and she does not like the
dogs she'd remember she used to living
alone so she's she's been spoiled for
her whole life so when misty and Maiko
come over cuz my parents are here with
them she gets a little she gets a little
upset and she really she tests the
limits that she can push with those dogs
Maiko doesn't care make us as big as she
is but Misty's bigger than Pepsi so you
know Pepsi's got it she's gonna see how
how far you can push before it just
makes misty bark and how long do all
those gnarly things Pepsi packs down
very quickly but she's over there right
now I'm sure watching the dog looks very
closely I didn't want to keep her in
here because she might have worn it out
at some point
let's see Toma pink $10 Canadian I
appreciate that my dude you look like a
halo
youtuber by the name the act man when
you're both wearing glasses Afghan jihad
the look in love the act man question
what's the minimum specs to build a
second PC for streaming only looking to
get 1080p 60fps this is something that
you could probably get away with this is
like power supplies right you could get
away with a 450 or 500 watt power supply
and a 1070 i seven eighty seven or
cables right but you don't want to push
the limit it's it's you could if you
want it if you were on a really tight
budget but assuming that you're not and
you want that second pc because you
could scream on your first pc but i
assume you're gonna have some money left
over and you're comfortable spending
that money because you want a second pc
just for this subject i would say no
less than an i5 a modern i5 and no less
on AMD side than arisin v 1400 or 2400 g
if you want to go with with the APU and
I say that for a couple of reasons you
don't know what you'll be if you want to
just stream on that PC you could
probably away with even an i3 cuz that's
all it's gonna be doing but I would say
just in case you want to have extra
Headroom if you want to push that
bitrate up you want to use obviously
x264 for that then my yeah my
recommendation would be at least r5 or
i5 just again because you want to play
it safe to me that makes sense
scrolling down AMD best value that's
right i believe that i think amy does
have the value on their side right now
all across the board no maybe not with
graphics cards I think Nvidia is still
dominating that market not from the
Turing perspective but from the Pascal
perspective look Pascal is still very
viable in 2018 don't you guys to feel
like if you buy a Pascal card right now
that you're behind the times like you
couldn't afford the Turing stuff you had
to buy the Pascal stuff that's
absolutely not true the gtx 1070 is
still one of the best value graphics
cards on the market right now the gtx
1060 falls slowly behind that the RX v 7
t RX 580 both for naked parents of that
card are still great in 2018 for 1080p
and even 1440p gaming medium to high
settings sometimes even very high
settings depending on the game and your
cpu to back it up so
it really I don't know I I would just
say you know if you're on a budget of
let's say a thousand dollars or less
sticking with a GTX 1060 or 1070 or five
five seventy or five eighty is just gold
it really is and that budget it's gold
if you want to buy used then you're
gonna save even more money on the
graphics card you'll be able to buy a
nicer CP or a nice your motherboard or
more ram or you know bigger storage
drive so you can really work with your
budget if you're willing to go use and
that's why I've pushed someone to use
graphic art videos lately but even if
you choose to buy new which again I'm
not gonna dock you for that's your
prerogative that's what you choose to do
with your money then you can still work
out a solid 1080p or 1440p gaming PC
within a thousand dollar budget at least
in the US I'm not sure about Canada
other places obviously they typically
charge more for a comparable easy parts
so that sucks and then Europe has the
VAT tax so plenty of things to consider
outside of the United States but for
those who live inside the United States
which is roughly fifty to sixty percent
of my audience and you're gonna be
sitting in the neighborhood especially
if you buy used but even new Pascal is
cheaper than it wasn't launched which is
good for the most part let's see

adrian kia wong kikyo ki own kiki own
our butcher - says hey there man love
you bids mate from australia here i
appreciate that my dude I heard you guys
internet it's not that great Brian was
telling me he's a decent internet I
think I think he told me that but
Australia in general is not known for
their internet speeds and I think that's
due to the different ways that it's
linked with other servers across the
planet obviously they have to go
completely across the Pacific to get to
the US and that's a big issue latency
there is another thing to consider so
I'm wondering how how it really is a lot
like if I move to Australia tomorrow
like what should I expect Internet wise
and what should I expect to pay for that
for that bandwidth I'm just curious
okay scrolling down Mike Bella boki
what's the best CPU to get right now and
depending mean best value or best or
former best performer before the 9,900 k
comes out for gaming it's TV 700k
hands-down best value I would say the
2600 from AMD is the best value right
now is your 6 cores 12 threads nearly
paying about 200 bucks for it that to me
stomps all over the i-5 counterpart
which is gonna cost about the same but
you're not gonna get multi-threading
you're not gonna get hyper threading
because Intel is Intel so take the gravy
from AMD while you can at that price I
think that 2600 is a killer BET right
now and you can click XMP in the BIOS
and not have to worry about anything
else
it's not stubborn like Rison one was the
first gen rise and stuff ok John Heysel
men are you getting the evolve X rip my
dude I already have a review of the
evolve X on the channel so might want to
go watch that GG ok it's scrolling down
here let's see I'm at the very bottom
I'm reading all the chats right now I
know I missed a lot I can't really keep
up with them but I'm I'm live right now
reading your guys comments so when you
type them I read them try and find the
good ones then I'm 4:15 what do you
think AMD will bring this spring CPU and
GPU eyes I have absolutely no idea to be
honest like a lot of these companies to
keep things under wraps and they do a
great job doing it I know as soon as the
other tech reviewers when we have an
upcoming cpu launch they're usually
pretty good about telling us that stuff
again of course under embargo but in
general if AMD had something coming I
could probably hint it to you some way
in some fashion I don't I haven't heard
anything from them recently I mean the
read Ripper 2 was their big thing right
so nothing this year that I know of if
something does come out I mean I'm out
of the loop I don't really read the news
or the hype or like the you know the
rumors and leaks but I will say I've had
no contact with them recently because
there is not much to report on so and
then also from the graphics card side of
things I'm not sure I mean out the the
Vega 56 and 64 in my opinion were flops
not because of the performance because
they were they were comparable
performance wise but the inventory
levels just weren't there they're there
now you can buy rx 15 excuse me uh Vega
56 for what around 400 bucks to me
that's a decent deal that puts it right
in line with the gtx 1070 then it comes
down to software I prefer Nvidia softer
I'm just more familiar with it usually
I'll choose that
seventy-eight Cudas support in Adobe
products that's not a big part for me
but you know if you're into just
supporting AMD because you feel like
supporting AMD I have no problem with
that if that's your again that's
something that you prefer to do then
Vega 56 is viable but the launch itself
was difficult people couldn't get the
cards and then the mining craze took off
and then those cards were ungettable and
people are paying thousands of dollars
for Vega 64 it's ridiculous they were
some of the best mining cards available
but still that hurt the gamer so I think
it really comes down to how quickly they
can release a new graphics card you know
a new GPU architecture and what the
prices end up being I think they have a
huge opportunity here to UNAC return and
video look if they release their cards
right now that would that would stifle
Nvidia is cheaper line up so much look
Nvidia it only has the 2017-2018 22 Ti
from Turing which means that we have to
fall back a Pascal so that means that
whatever aim he releases now new that's
affordable will compete with Nvidia's
all their gen stuff which i think isn't
all that bad because it gives us more
more of an option right we're not stuck
to buying older hardware and at the same
time we're probably gonna get better
performance for the same price because
this again will be new architecture and
seven nanometer that's and that's it's
nothing to laugh at
so we'll see what it really brings I
don't know much about it because we
haven't heard much from them in this
regard no but we know what's coming I
just don't know how soon I also realized
that my chat window is completely
chopped off in the live feed and that
sucks
Hassan Aslam does using a riser cable
for graphics cards make your FPS drop
yes the answer to that is yes but it
depends on the riser cable so some
rather cables won't make a drop at all I
should clarify like the riser cable that
I use in my personal rig doesn't result
in an FPS drop you can verify that very
easily just remove the riser cable plug
the cord straight into the PCI slot on
the motherboard run your tests and then
swap it back out and you can usually
gauge the FPS Delta usually within the
margin of error one or two FPS that
means that there's no difference at all
but a bad razor cable will give you very
chop
frame rates that's one of the reasons
why you know you might be able to tell
that a riser cables going bad if your
FPS are really smooth and then all of a
sudden you get a really big drop frame
maybe it takes half a second for those
frames to load right that's that's an
incredibly long amount of time you will
notice that that actually happened with
Lisa's system I had to swap that riser
cable for another one and then BOOM no
more chop and she was complaining about
it a lot
so I basically deduced it down to that
riser cable I swapped the card I made
sure CPU was you know the overclock sure
stable tried reinstall in the game and
then I just said screw it it's probably
riser cable
I should have ultimately thought that it
was riser cable to begin with I just
didn't think much of it I didn't think
he could go bad in the middle of gaming
but it certainly did because when I
swapped it for another one it was good
to go let's see here
Kevin Xing hi greg been watching your
videos for two years I appreciate the
support Kevin thank you for that do you
think older CPUs like the i-5 60 600k
and i7 4790k are still worth it for
gaming if bought at a low price might
regret my decision might might regret my
decision go use it's a good question
yeah I definitely think that they're
still viable
you could game on a 4790k a no problem
and you're really only gonna see with
respect to Intel maybe it's tough if you
if you go back as far as Ivy Bridge I
know the difference is between 20 to 30
percent so that means that if you're
gaming on a 8700 can now and you're
getting 100 FPS you're gonna lose about
30% of those frames if you drop down to
Ivy Bridge but dropping down to just has
well I'm pretty sure I have to go back
and test I haven't tested this recently
I would say that the difference there is
only gonna be 10 to 15% maybe a little
more depending on the clock speeds
obviously if you know 55.2 giga eighties
500k is gonna blow and 47 any k out of
the water at 4.4 gigahertz so it really
depends on on clocks but four cores and
eight threads and 2018 is still okay
people tend to oh it's a quad core oh I
don't want a quad core right because AMD
made hexa core CPUs mainstream when they
released the the r5 series but I would
say that an i-5 from back then it's
going to be okay an i7 is still going to
be acceptable I would say obviously
better than just a quad core non hyper
thread
Intel CPU so a 4790k I would probably
pay around I wouldn't pay more than what
an r5 1400 cost so if you can get an RFI
1400 for a hundred and sixty bucks
that's about how much I would pay for a
4790k but I have a feeling that those
are going for a bit more on eBay which
means that I would probably recommend a
risin 5 over that just because you get a
brand-new system and the motherboards
aren't going to be as difficult to
obtain right if you buy in 4790k you're
probably not gonna find a new c 97
motherboard out there you're gonna have
to buy a used e 97 motherboard which
will then require you to buy ddr3 and
ddr4 sure yeah that's ddr3 and ddr4
used as well so all that to consider
right so if you go with the Rison 5 chip
you're gonna be on TV or you're gonna be
on a newer chipset and you're no more
support more features more than likely
and I'm tie it probably cost you the
same if not less just because the
platform is so cheap up front all right
let's see here
scroll up okay Brandon says he asks is a
650 watt power supply enough for an i7
8700 K and RT X 1080 heavily overclocked
I'm pretty sure the recommended power
supply for a 1080 is 600 watts or there
abouts so yeah I think that's perfectly
fine and I know it's fine actually even
if it's heavily overclocked depends on
how only obviously if you're like doing
some really weird like custom cooling or
you're like dumping liquid nitrogen on
the thing and you're overclocking it
across the board or like 4,000 megahertz
whatever they get them to that's gonna
that's gonna consume a ton of power
you're gonna want an overclocking power
supply for that but 650 watts for your
average gamer even when overclocked both
on your CPU and your GPU is acceptable
and even if it's not ideal right at
maybe the 400 watt range because that
would be your peak efficiency you're
still going to be comfortably within
that 0 to 650 watt range you're gonna be
near 5 I would say you're probably gonna
zoom around 500 watts or so it depends
on how heavily overclocked that r-tx
2010 80 is 2080 I think is what you mean
it really depends I'm actually running
some power consumption tests right now
on my r-tx 2080s so we'll see very soon
okay but bah I see a question from Joran
Brea's bren's dull thoughts on the
coolermaster h 500 new version with mesh
front I actually already reviewed that
so you should go watch mine
watch my video on it that would probably
him I'm pretty sure the H 500 H 500 P
mesh are the same
pretty sure I mean that if they're
different they're very very tiny
differences between the two so go watch
my review on that and then maybe that'll
give you a better view I'm just telling
you that because it's easier to explain
in the video that I already created
about the subject versus wasting time
for other people who already have seen
the video in this livestream to answer
the question okay let's see okay mr.
Sudz i7 7700 K or rise in 2700 X for
games only I would still go with the
2700 X even if the 7700 K has a slight
edge in games it's still locked to 4
cores and if you ever decide to do
anything else other than game at the
same time especially you're gonna
benefit from the rise in 2700 X so I
would go with that one in my opinion
assuming you're not worried about the
price difference there and I don't
really know your prices you can you can
be living in a totally different country
for prices are totally different but
that's something for you to consider
something that I don't really know okay
let's see stamp says love your videos
keep with a good book I appreciate that
there are so many questions I am trying
my best
no problem John I appreciate it I hope
you enjoy the review again if you have
any other questions about the review
maybe I didn't answer something you were
looking for in that review of the age
500 then you can leave a question just
at me in the discord server and I'll be
sure to get to it I look at all my ads
sometimes I'm a day or two behind but I
try to reply to all of them especially
if they're good questions like that
Rex's text is a 92 TI is still capable
yes it is
I've videos on that actually very recent
videos within the last two or three
weeks I invite you to watch those it's
about used graphics cards and I use
about 290 DT eyes though tech amp
extremes
to prove the point right when I'll spend
my own money on these cards because I
think that they're great values so if
you spend around 200 bucks on an 8 1980
i its gtx 1070 issue performance I think
it's a really great value because 1070
is the new are selling for 400 bucks or
higher you can even get 10 70s for
around 220 bucks or so on eBay if you're
willing to look and bid on the right
once let's see here
scrolling down this is a good one check
shot Crawley oh gosh and butchered that
name I apologize have you ever tried to
build a hackintosh and just to learn
from it I've had many people request
that and I haven't gotten around to it
yet because I am very afraid that I will
not know what I'm doing I know it's easy
just to follow the steps in the forums
but I actually have to get around doing
that and I have to make sure that I have
the hardware that supports a hackintosh
build so it's gonna take more research
than I've done currently to actually
successfully do one I'm going to
probably hit up Quinn from snazzy labs
just to make sure that I know what I'm
doing because he's done that quite a few
times so maybe we'll do like some kind
of collaboration might be really cool
clad between the channels we'll see if
we can do something like that well let's
see zombie city's house will doing
haven't seen him much on discord the
good question uh so will if he's asking
this because we got hit by the hurricane
right and all the powers out we have no
power on the east side of the bridge and
no water and no cell service
so people have no idea what's going they
have never they haven't seen the news in
a week they have no idea if their loved
ones are okay it's actually kind of
scary and we'll I had no idea that will
was okay until he texted me about two
days ago actually in Skype so he
probably found a Wi-Fi hotspot or
something and sent me and he's like hey
I'm still alive I mean it's a literally
what he said but he was watching his dad
his dad has some medical issues so he
was with his dad making sure he was okay
throughout the thing and I think the
hospital that he was in I mean she's got
obliterated so now the roof is like
missing leaks everywhere basically what
happened to my parents house so I was
good to hear that he was okay but I he
probably won't be underscore for a while
there's gonna be a lot of cleanup I'm
not even sure if the house he's
currently renting is even livable I
don't know I mean he's lived in the
house for a while several years I
believe
and again I don't know if he can
actually live in it because it might be
completely flooded out so we'll see I
will try my best to keep up with him we
talk almost daily but since this
hurricane we haven't been able to talk
very much at all so well to catch up and
see what's going on well let's hear Joe
we have a Greg what's your favorite GPU
under 100 Joey I literally have a video
that's like titled that exact thing that
I uploaded like four or five days ago
you should go watch that video best
graphics card for a hundred bucks it's
in that video
that's a GTX 970 let's see
Brandon Smith asks is a $50 gtx 1070
suspicious i'm gonna say yeah probably
you know what it sounds like one of
those ripoff chinese brand graphics
cards that are actually flashed they
have flashed bios's so the dies
themselves are gtx 550 TI's or some
garbage like that and they just flash
biases that make cpu-z or whatever or
GPZ identify the flash bios as the
actual card when in reality the hardware
is different I know that some buddies of
the GPU the GP identifier is now tell
you when it's a fake card which is kind
of funny because once it tells you it's
a fake card it's kind of too late right
because you've already bought it so I
don't really know how much good that
does
bloody let's see bloody glitch asked a
good question will FEMA cover your
parents house or their insurance the
FEMA doesn't okay so FEMA's supplemental
stuff and FEMA doesn't cover much at all
so when hurricane let's say Hurricane
Katrina went through it wiped out all
those homes in Louisiana because they
were under sea level usually this check
stood between like a thousand and three
thousand dollars it's not meant to
replace your home it's just a
supplemental so they expect you to have
insurance flood insurance just the home
insurance in general and then FEMA comes
in and says hey we'll help you out a
little more we'll give you this for
maybe relocation expenses or whatever
that's what FEMA steps in and does but
home insurance is for actually replacing
the home you'll never get FEMA insurance
that doesn't exist FEMA is just there to
kind of
woman whatever you might have coming
from your insurance company because
sometimes it takes a while for insurance
companies to pay things out so that's
how that's how FEMA works good question
though
nuts see scrolling down and your night
asked I love turtles
am i did I say something that makes
actually think that I love terms
who doesn't love turtles now it's kind
of a dumb question it's like seeing who
doesn't love teddy bears like who really
doesn't look teddy bear so that's a
genuine question if you don't like teddy
bear teddy bears let me know in the chat
is uh we're gonna have a talk okay
scrolling down and again in copyright at
science studio I missed it what is scary
is how dependent we are or we have
become technology if one small piece
goes around the entire system goes down
you have look dude I think one of the
biggest threats to our modern society is
society as an EMP when I think about an
EMP I think about a nuclear detonation
that's a byproduct of that but it's
funny because I don't really think about
the destruction of like an entire city
by nuke being the biggest issue I always
think about the aftermath like the
nuclear fallout of the EMP that kills
all the electronics like to me those are
the long lasting effects right people
get incinerated instantly by these bombs
but but the people that survived are
gonna stare I mean they're gonna gosh I
think I'd rather die quickly and then
die slowly by radiation poisoning so
those are the people that really get
hammered and I think just from like uh
because he had dragged out and not
having power from an EMP and just being
exposed a nuclear fault that's a that's
a huge issue and I think that if
anything big like that happened those
would be the the just the most pertinent
things that would affect us personally
not having electronics not having
technology at our disposal would
definitely send us back into the Stone
Age and that is a scary scary thing
let's see here I don't I can't read your
name because it's in looks like Japanese
but I don't know for sure hey Greg I was
about to pull the trigger on an 8700 K
but wondering if I should wait for Rison
- it would be risin 530 600 X 7 and a
meter I'll be gaming it that resident 4k
upgrading from 9 from
from 1080p okay if you're jumping to 4k
you're gonna offset your CPU usage your
CPUs are just going to drop because your
frame rate is going to drop and that
puts more leverage on your graphics card
to push out you know to render each
pixel versus having to render multiple
frames at the same time which is
something that your CP struggles to do
we have videos talking about this
extensively but if you plan to jump from
1080p to 4k then it really makes no
sense to wait for a better CPU because
that's not going to be your limiting
factor it will be your graphics card
also I have no idea where you got rising
530 600 X from because I've never heard
of that before
if that's some leak or whatever I
wouldn't count on that being the name
but I also wouldn't be willing to wait
that long because we don't know how long
that's gonna take before that 7:00 a.m.
your stuff arrives so don't get your
hopes up I would say 80s 200 K is
perfectly fine right now if you want to
buy me to sit under K okay let's see
Moe euro did you manage to get your
money back from that super cheap
graphics card yes I actually I said in
that video mode that I would upgrade
update the the comment section I would
pin my comment with my ultimate like you
know result from that I would tell you
guys if I got scammed totally never got
my money back or if I got my money back
and how long it took I did get it I did
get my money back it took thirty
something days I think 35 days and the
reason for that is because PayPal holds
that money when it's under dispute for
30 days so you're gonna be waiting I
think it's 30 days you're gonna be
waiting that long for your money kind of
in limbo so it won't actually go to the
seller but it won't come back to you
because eBay has to settle a dispute
especially if you do it via PayPal so
that money stays there in that little
limbo state and then it gets refunded to
you when they determine that your claim
is valid and that the purchaser was
attempting to rip you off and that's
what happened so it was about a little
over a month to get the money back so if
you're really worried about being
scammed but you're not afraid of not
seeing that money for you know a while
and it's not gonna hurt just to try it
but obviously like someone said earlier
Brandon said earlier if it's a $50 gtx
1070 that's a scam like point-blank that
or the card is broken and that's
misleading if it's not mentioned so keep
an eye out for all that good stuff
ladies and gentlemen all right scrolling
down just a little more
but the Baba okay seeing some good
questions
uh-huh fries official is to go one
what's the best GPU an FX 6300 can
handle no bottleneck with an Rx 588 gig
work fine
depends on the game look you can't say
that a game is never gonna bottleneck
under a certain searching me under for a
certain computer build because every
game utilizes resources differently so
you know you play in GTA 5 of a pretty
balanced game between CP and GP
horsepower you could be playing witcher
3 where it's all about your graphics
card and you could run on a g f-- you
know g 32-bit 32:58 oh gosh my Pentiums
are getting confused you know I'm saying
like dual core dual core CPUs from way
back when I think it's it yeah it's a
32:58
right am I going crazy that was the one
that was overclockable the anniversary
edition yeah if that's not it I just my
mom but anyway yeah I think that's what
I'm talking about you can go with
something like that and play witcher 3
and 4k and not have too many hard core
issues you might have some stutters but
in general it's almost always gonna be
your graphics card at higher resolutions
with those games especially so it really
depends on the game but i would say in
general an FX 6300 is gonna be paired
just fine with anything at at gtx 1060 s
level or lower your your cpu is almost
gonna be always the bottleneck when
you're using an FX 6300 even if it's
overclocked just because of how
inefficient piledriver and bulldozer
architecture is and that's for a variety
of reasons we have videos on that as
well talking about why FX processors
aren't actually hexa core and octa-core
processors because they share many
resources including a scheduler which
limits things quite a bit
no idea I think they share FP use I'm
trying to think off the top my head what
it was they shared all this they shared
quite a bit it mimics to an extent
multi-threading which is that would make
the FX 6300 you know triple core try
core what would you say yeah try core
right it doesn't mean I feel like I'm
losing my mind
anyway you get the point it's scrolling
down and see best RGB fan that was a
good question I really liked the Borah
fans from Lee and Lee I think they have
really cool really cool RGB fans
Corsair has really great RGB fans if you
want to go with NZXT they have a great
RGB setup with the hue hue i know i
think now they have out the only reason
why I don't recommend thermaltake RGB
fans is because they're a little the
LEDs are more spaced out so they don't
diffuse very well I don't like I don't
like it when our TVs don't diffuse so
that's a reason why I always use either
g.skill tried and CR GB RAM or I use a
team group now huh RGB around a team who
does a great job as well
scattering that light and and I think G
skills is probably the best at it
of course there's new RGB Ram is really
good as well again course there's really
good from an RGB front altogether not
too much the diffusion there's really
good and the customization is really
good because software is great NZXT is
really good as well
again the hue plus using the camp
software it's gonna be a little more
resource intensive in general but that's
because in txt actually takes diagnostic
info and uses that for their build
service so there are a few different
options but in general it's a corsair
NZXT for just fans leanly bora fans are
really good those are probably my top 3
ok scrolling down here let's see you got
about 10 more minutes in lastik it's by
really fast she's thirty nine fifty okay
Timmy 2g at science to do what do you
think of the I $9.99 hundred K and how
they said that until cheated on the
benchmarks Timmy I literally released
that video like yesterday you should go
and watch that video answers your
question tells you exactly what I think
about the situation okay Pat adolfo back
in July I bought an i7 4790k with a
motherboard and 16 gigs of ram from my
brother for 300 bucks I originally had
an i5 2408 gigs of ram would you
personally say it was a good deal hmm
yeah I would say yeah I seven with 16
gigs of ram and a motherboard that to me
just if if you have a system before that
that's a really good deal for three
hundred bucks you could probably sell
just the CPU for two hundred and then 16
gigs of ddr3 still gonna sell for it I
would say around a hundred bucks
so you're basically getting a
motherboard for free I don't think
that's a bad platform at all and you
could certainly game on that as well
so yeah I think you made out that's a
really good really good deal they're
scrolling down and see Jason Azevedo
thing but that five dollar Canadian
super chat Manu does raising the power
target of a 1080 TI to the maximum for
everyday use in gaming to grade the chip
over time I intend to keep it for two to
three years yes so it's going to degrade
the obviously if you run more voltage
through a chip it's going to degrade
faster how much faster that degrees is
difficult if not impossible to measure
and that's why there is no set standard
like hey if you set your voltage to
three point or one point three six to
your CPS gonna last for four point five
years if you set it to one point four
two it's gonna last for one point six
years right so obviously as you increase
voltage you're making that thing heat up
faster those those power tolerances are
big they're limited and when you're
running that much voltage through very
tiny fine parts those things could split
fry you get certain chunks of
transistors that don't function anymore
I mean look with every wafer that's ever
ever created there's never as far as I
know I mean difficult to actually
quantify this but have a perfect way for
it with every transistor and the entire
wafer working perfectly that's why you
have bidding right that's why you have
certain things that that limit the CPUs
ability to overclock right power
tolerances and that's a big one
overclocking tolerances with respect to
heat right because those two are
typically exponentially related once you
hit a certain frequency threshold the
voltage requirement just skyrockets and
that is due to binning that is due to
the imperfections in each of those dies
so yeah if you raise the power tolerance
or if you raise the the power target
you're going to wear it out quicker but
to what degree I can't tell you every GJ
extended yeah it's gonna be different
because they're all running on different
dyes and on top of that even if they all
ran on the exact same dye you would
still wouldn't be able to quantify that
because there are different
environmental situations right maybe
it's running a little harder maybe your
system in general is just running a
little hotter or who knows using a
different motherboard different power
supply all those tiny
little differences in ripple and all
that stuff can affect it but in general
raising the power target I don't think
it's gonna kill your graphics card
anytime soon unless it's just not
manufactured well these cards are able
to handle over clocks in fact they
encourage over clocks because they're
automatically overclocked typically out
of the box anyway I wouldn't be afraid
to do it just don't do it you know to an
insane level that and then you're just
testing your look okay
mr. smile when will graphene chips be
used to make processors good question
mr. smile I have actually a video
dedicated to that about we know what's
the limit for transistors how small can
we truly go before quantum tunneling
takes over and it just defeats the
purpose of having a transistor in a chip
anyway that's a good question I have
that video up I believe it's in the
crash course playlist it might be them
in a science but I'm not sure if I did
that one fast or slow but it's it's on
the channel and the less I invite you to
watch that video you will be entertained
I think let's see
Ethan Hinkle do you think it will be
worth it to take apart my of course
there 570 X and paint it white I think
the white version looks so good
don't they sell white 570 X but painting
is not as easy as it looks and you're
gonna have some very unless you're a
good painter you consider yourself a
professional painter I'm certainly not
any time I have to paint anything I'm
always kind of afraid because if I
butcher it I got to start from scratch i
scrub all the paint off with nail polish
remover or something and start again
but painting it to me painting a case is
very difficult because there are so many
fine crevices and grooves and you could
just buy a white 570 X I'm pretty sure
so if you're that concerned about it
being white just sell your 570 X and buy
a new one and you know eat the
difference in cost that's what I would
do okay
I see a couple more questions here I'm
gonna get to the DS right now I
appreciate all these good questions you
guys are the bomb.com for joining me on
this Sunday night slash a Monday morning
or afternoon depending on where you live
on the planet let's see Luise Carpio D
living on horizon not recommended
because rising for the most part is
soldered and that's not smart so you
don't want to delete a soldered chip
that's one way to kill your chip very
fast don't do it now I usually they use
some like indium gallium mix and that's
the gallium part makes it flew it enough
to where it doesn't you know it doesn't
require this order to heat up to very
high temperatures which could damage the
die and the indium is believed the
indium is the conductor part I want to
say that having Indian there is
important but the the gallium keeps it
kind of liquid because gallium melts in
your hand and that makes it slightly
malleable it's like liquid metal that
used from thermal Grizzly they're not
the same thing but they're similar okay
let's see here Demetrios P through 50 x
mesh if I see or H 500 that's a typical
question okay I think you're looking at
three different price ranges there
Dimitri's I would say P 3 4 DX if you're
worried about price excuse me cuz you
can get that for about 60 bucks I think
it's a really great value
I think it's 60 bucks and the measure of
IC is a little more expensive but it's
gonna have better air flow and I think
it looks I think it's got a really clean
look it's a very subtle look but you
know what's mesh if I see when you see
it that are defined C so depends on how
much you want to spend if you're more
worried about value the P 350 X is it
also if you're more worried about RGB
elimination the P 350 X is it but if
we're more worried about just being cool
you know just being chilled nice YC is
the better bet aged 500 only if you want
a bigger case for water cooling or the
sword scrolling down
let's see but uh good questions here
okay I've science studio would you say
the four cores four threads is holding
me back on my I 570 600 K paired with a
GTX 1063 gate nope I would actually say
that what's holding you back with that
is your three gig frame buffer on 1060 I
don't think that was a I think that was
kind of a it was just wasn't a good move
on Intel's part already not Intel Nvidia
start with a three gig frame buffer on a
1060 kind of cuts it at its knees
because it's very easy to max out three
gigs of ram especially in some modded
games but you could max out GTA 5
settings and get pretty close to that
sometimes so and a 1060 can handle all
those things you add on to it for the
most part in 1080p but the frame buffer
sometimes is the limiting factor in to
me that should never be the case in the
graphics card
excuse me so I think your your you know
your quad courtship there is certainly
going to be a bottleneck in a certain
situations but I think that your 1063
gig is probably the thing that I would
grade first believe it or not just
because if you upgrade the CPU you're
either gonna have to go upgrade the
entire platform at your acquire a
motherboard and CPU change versus just
don't make from a 1062 a 1070 in my
opinion would be basically a night and
day difference especially in 1440p okay
let's see here Java okay I see one from
Java what's his name Java budget gaming
I see have an III Xeon gaming PC build
video I'd love for you to make a an X 30
for xx hyper 30 variants PC build
they're good second gen i7 equivalent
CPUs when overclocked to 3.8 plus ki
creates with a 1060 yeah and this is
something that I would say is probably
more in Brian's realm from techie city
I'm Brian I worked work together a lot
but I would say that that's certainly
something we could do on the channel I
would just need Brian's help so maybe we
can have as a guest in that video and we
can put something like that together the
problem is though all that stuff's out
of pocket so whenever I buy used
components right I don't get the used
components for free from anybody I mean
it's difficult for me to source all
these parts from multiple videos so when
I do something like this I'm kind of
going all-in
maybe I'll resell it that could be how i
recoup my investment give you a second
video on trying to sell the thing so
that's that's a possibility but in
general I try to have all the components
in hand upfront if I can from a company
if I don't like with my used graphic
cards I bought all those out of pocket
but it just helps when I don't have to
dip into my own business account to pay
for all this stuff because it can get
very expensive especially when we build
at least one PC week so that's nothing
am I afraid of but again if I if I sell
these could sell these builds it'd be a
cool way to try to flip them you know we
can do something like that try to
experiment who's the best flipper maybe
it would be pretty cool just a way to
spice things up in the channel a bit a
bit Explorer I think about five I like
super check my dude I appreciate it just
build an i 565 650 Wow
I 5 650 1066 gig super super clocked a
gig would a better upgrade I three beat
80 100 or an i-5 8400 I mean obviously
the i5 8400 is the
better I think we can all agree on that
for the price I still think the I 584
hundreds a better bet if you want to
stick with Intel which I assume we do
didn't recommend an hour five processor
then I would say the r5 excuse me the i5
8400 is the best bet I think it's the
best i five cpu around for around 180
bucks sometimes you can get it for I
think it's a really good value still not
as good as rising five just throwing
that out there but if you want to stick
with until I totally get it
the i5 8400 will game very well in 1080p
1440p an in 4k just because it does have
six of course at its disposable and the
clocks are decent considering the SKUs
is not an unlock SKU so yeah I think I
think the I have 84 hundreds a better
bet I wouldn't buy an i3 at this point I
I think that the risin fives have
definitely wiped wipe the floor with the
art with the i3 unless you're doing just
gaming which is something I don't
recommend anybody commit to because you
find you'll use that system for more
than just gaming down the line I bet I'm
in the RFI for sci-fi of debacle I think
that I mean because you can buy a risin
7 1700 s for like a hundred and eighty
bucks sometimes that to me kills cr5 are
the i5 excuse me but if you again are
just gaming and that's all you're ever
worried about and I that's the one place
where the i-5 is recommended in my book
it's just it's very difficult for me to
say hey just buy a system or build a
system just for gaming because I don't
think it's something you're ever gonna
only do you either get into streaming or
you get into content creation or you
want to do something above gaming cuz
gaming is just gaming right that's all
it is it's just for you but if you want
to do it for other people and do it to
grow your business or whatever then
you're gonna want to do more than just
game and I think you're limiting
yourself when you just buy you know an
i5 when you could have so much more your
disposal with multi-threading support
and more cores again you're supposed for
the same price okay let's do one more
question here let's see I'm looking for
something something juicy give me
somethin give me a good question
somebody who I haven't answered a
question from yet let's see here Java
says no problem man just saying as a
future video idea totally cool man yeah
and that's actually a really good idea I
think I think it's a good idea because
we haven't done as the unbuilding a long
time like you said yeah we've only done
one on the channel another while back
that was actually a newsie on that I
because it was a it was an alternative
to the i7 skew that was a little more
expensive does neon just didn't have a
dedicated GPU let's see something good
folks and give me something good
how long do you feel oh gosh I can't
even I can't remember the last time I
had oatmeal is that weird I think it's
weird okay uh hmm see I'm looking at all
questions I'm looking at them I'm
looking for something juicy yeah I
better be juicy folks see see I see him
rolling in oh yeah here they come oh
yeah not soon okay these are looking at
all right let's see here Kevin Shane
have you built in a Corsair Air 240 no I
haven't maybe at some point I will I
know they wanted me to build on it or
they wanted me to review it I just I
didn't have the time because I wasn't
about to get ready to move that was
right after copy text a thing when they
were sending this out and I had a lot of
things on my plate a lot of case reviews
actually that I had already planned but
I think I will build in it at some point
I just need it I need more em ATX
motherboards I have many here I don't
have any here right now so I got to get
a couple of ax boards in here we'll do a
couple cool videos with cases like that
for sure Jonathan asked looking for any
good Black Friday deals not really you
know I noticed last year's Black Friday
was basically TV he's like that was all
they were really pitching to people was
like hey check out this 4k 55 inch TV
for three hundred dollars like no I saw
a ton of that and maybe some console
deals nothing really on graphics cards
and CPUs it was just a really bad time
and and I was kind of pointed by that I
think the year before that was much
better
so we'll see I cursed I'll keep my I'll
keep my eye open and if we do see
anything really good we will have those
videos on the channel for you guys to
check out hopefully in advance so you
can plan for them in the future that's
just my take on it
z77 job
as my question isn't juicy yet you
didn't ask the question in the comments
so rip that right you were supposed to
ask it and so I can read the whole thing
not just part of it anyway let's see
your ex bougie says keep up the good
videos I appreciate that my dude
look it is 10:05 here folks it's been a
long day but help my parents clean up
and we're gonna be doing more that
tomorrow I imagine so I'm gonna get on
out of here I appreciate you stopping by
on the Sunday night slash Monday morning
or afternoon depending on where you live
on the planet this is after-hours number
27 before we end this one I'm gonna ask
you guys to please spam the chat box
with your favorite emojis and that's how
we end every After Hours livestream
we've known that for the past what 10 or
so episodes and I love that it gives me
a chance to shout it at you guys for
watching and for being very vocal in the
chatbox so please spam with your
favorite emoji you're not gonna be
blocked or anything like that and one's
gonna know mom's gonna mess with you I
am telling you right now to please spam
the chat
give me your favorite emojis and I will
do my best to shout out to as many of
them as I see before we call this one
quits I see Cody salats already jumping
on board we have video games planet
what's going on
pretty much where it is video games
planet the house is where it is it's the
same as it was in the video there's it's
actually getting worse because the roof
is like now caving in
so we'll be cleaning more of it out
tomorrow Jaakko I see you I see dr.
dizzle I see a costumed pet - gosh I'm
butchering these name let's see I see
Derrick I see Ethan I see Raptor
I see SEF I see Adrienne what's going on
folks
I see Joel I see what's up Chris
crystals Corsair Chris what's going on
my dude I see Johnny see I see tech
crimson thanks for modding tech crimson
DC Jeff Phillips what's going on Jeff
toaster
I got a toaster in here I see Steve I
see I would say DP I see Mick ice what's
gonna make ice I see KKW e-dawg two
three seven three Steve W Louis Caprio
I see Bernard Joseph Bryan L I see
Benjamin C I see me here I see oh my
gosh Steven I see Bernard
Brian elegan Joran oh my gosh brought
join there's so many
because I'd told people to spam the chat
with emojis that's how we end the
livestreams
just I said that like 10 seconds ago
anyway what do we have here more low I
see the one Reaper I see King Karl
I see Carolina customs and alright
looking pretty good I like to see the
chat saturate at the end of the day with
your favorite emojis because it gives me
a chance again to thank you personally
or as personally as we can possibly get
this to be for tuning in to the 27th
after hours here on science studio again
thanks for watching folks I want to
swing on over here so I can actually end
the livestream appropriately I
appreciate you guys taking time out your
day to watch the livestream and stay
tuned for more videos on the channel
there will be more coming up very soon
including a 2080 review we're gonna go
pretty in-depth with this one because I
think you guys deserve the due diligence
stay tuned for that thanks for watching
I'm swinging over here it's getting
awkward I'll catch you in the next video
here we go and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
