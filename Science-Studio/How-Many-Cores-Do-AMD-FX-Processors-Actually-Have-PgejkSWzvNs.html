simplify things for you first up I want
you to erase every preconceived notion
you've had about AMD FX course when you
see the FX 6300 advertised as a hexa
core processor or the FX 8350 advertised
as an octa-core processor you're looking
at facts by acceptable definitions these
processors have the correct number of
cores specified but they are not
designed and do not function in the same
way that equivalent Intel cores do and
that's what this video will seek to
clarify the two architectures we'll be
comparing are the bulldozer architecture
from AMD most notably found in the FX
8000 series and the Sandy Bridge
architecture from Intel which you'll
find in their core 2000 series and a few
others although you could stretch this
to any modern Intel CPU they haven't
really changed much in this sense so
let's consider the FX 8350 and the i7
2700 K s not a 2700 K but you get my
point in these two cases things on paper
look fairly similar well apart from
price transistor architecture is
identical 32 nanometers for both they
both have 8 threads they both have 8
megabytes of l3 cache they also both
have unlocked multipliers but the FX
8350 is advertised as an eight-core
processor whereas the i7 2700 K is only
advertised as a quad core with hyper
threading a technology implemented by
Intel to increase instruction processing
essentially here's a crash course in
hyper threading a single Intel core is
split up into two quote unquote logical
cores which share total workload and
increased processing efficiency this is
explained clearly an Intel's 2012
architecture manual quote if both
logical cores are active the queue is
partitioned so that both logical
processors can make independent forward
progress and quote independent that's
the key word here an adept scheduler
efficiently allocates data between two
logical cores one of which could be busy
processing and the other of which could
be demanding more information so how is
this hyper-threaded i7 any different
from an eight-core FX processor and why
can't Intel just say that there is Evan
27 K is an 8 core processor let's dive a
little deeper so in short the reason a B
can get away with calling their 8315
octa-core CPU and Intel cannot is
because shocker the FX processor is
actually featuring aid processing cores
each core has its own
Niq scheduler which decides what from
system memory will be processed next as
well as its own level 1 cache this
contrasts Intel's logical course setup
in which two logical cores rely on a
single intelligent scheduler to disperse
data these logical cores of by the way
are not physical cores in fact there are
two logical cores per physical core
which means that hyper threading is
really just a manipulation of one core
or however many cores are in the
processor so yes FX processors are
special but in both good and bad ways
let's take a look at the bulldozer block
diagram the FX 8350 features four
modules and two integer cores per module
these integer cores are legitimate CPU
cores no doubt but are packed into
condensed modules for the sake of space
cost and efficiency but only in some
cases each module shares two megabytes
of l3 cache for a total of 8 megabytes
as described and each also shares a
single FPU or floating-point unit this
fu handles mathematical functions
addition subtraction multiplication you
get the point and the fact that
bulldozer forces pairs of course to rely
on a single FPU is what raises a bit of
concern here you see on Intel side the
i7 2700 K features four unique cores
with four independent FPU so one FPU per
core this is a case for any modern Intel
CPU and while this alone may not seem
like such a big deal it's what
ultimately gives Intel CPUs the clock
for clock edge in single core
performance FP use handle most
mathematical functions via the binary
system allocating a single FPU per pair
of cores can result in delays or quote
unquote lag times reducing overall
performance and especially intense
programs even gaming AMD claims the
opposite that a single FP per module
allows for overclocking Headroom and
higher mathematical complexity and
they're correct in theory this should be
the case most modern GPUs actually
follow the set up as well
FX FP is themselves technically have two
unique cores but the technology over the
years hasn't given the central
processing units the edge AMD expected
them to have thanks to Windows and other
programs assigning tasks and non
sequential arrays this means that
instead of software seeing an FX CPU as
a true quote/unquote eight core it
forces data through a pipeline similar
to hyper threading which if you remember
is nowhere near as efficient as two
independent cores
this explains why Cinebench for example
sees the FX 8350 as a four core
processor with eight threads and not an
8 core
processor with 8 threads basically AMD
banked on software following suit with
their new CPU design and that didn't
happen at all in fact from what we know
about Xen it seems like AMD's falling
back on what Intel's been sporting for
several years now coming up this entire
debate from a different angle processor
savvy individuals on the blue team might
also make the argument that because each
module only features a single fetcher
and decoder the two units that receive
and prepare data to be processed the
pair of cores within each module is
essentially bottleneck you see much like
hyper threading which we discussed
earlier epochs processors feature a
single point of entry per se for every
two cores meaning the information can be
bottleneck up top reducing the overall
efficiency of each physical core Intel
cores instead do not share these
fetchers and decoders with the simple
frequency calibration fetchers and
decoders can relay information to the
scheduler the same rate that the
scheduler disperses information to the
physical core or logical cores in the
case of hyper threading there are a few
less relevant things I decided to leave
out for the sake of both time and Mull
comprehension a lot was mentioned in
this video but the gist of this should
be rather clear while epics processors
do by definition possess the correct
number of core specified on their boxes
the cores themselves are very dependent
on other gates within the die namely the
FP use decoders and l2 caches all of
which individual Intel cores do not
share FX cores are also limited by
software and operating system
optimization as described a moment ago
something it's safe to say is neither
the fault of AMD nor developers since
Intel chips handle things much
differently and it's kind of hard to
play both sides of the aisle several
other factors play into the differences
in processing power between say in FX
8350 and an i7 2700 K overall block
diagram design clock speeds and core
efficiency are among them just something
to keep in mind it would take several
semesters to fully explain the
architectural differences between the
platforms and while I'm about to
graduate with a degree in engineering
I am eons away from being able to
explain these without thorough and
extensive research beforehand if there's
anything you'd like to add in the
comments section below by all means have
at it if you'd like what you saw in this
video and maybe learn a thing or two be
sure to give this thing a thumbs up give
it a thumbs down if you feel the
complete opposite or if you hate
everything about life be sure to
subscribe if you haven't already and
stay tuned for a future PC build as well
as some interesting reviews and
head-to-head clash ups I've got planned
be sure to stay tuned for the next one
