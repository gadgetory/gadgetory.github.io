to build a computer using all used
components and that's exactly what
you're looking at here so we've got a
used CPU used RAM used motherboard B
stock power supply and a used SSD not to
be more specific these are all eBay
parts with the exception of the case and
to be honest it's extremely difficult to
find used PC cases in my area so
searching Craigslist couldn't really
find anything suitable for this build
and eBay prices are a bit ridiculous
when you take into account shipping
because cases are very large so you're
often paying more than you would for
just buying the case outright new so I
recycled an old case I had other plans
for I think it's a bit hideous if I'm
being honest but it's cheap and build
friendly so we'll use it here and yeah
you could say I cheated in the case of
power supply bit but what I'm really
after in this video is stability
obviously if the parts work we aren't
gonna have any problem playing games but
how about temperatures versus I don't
know a new version of this build how's
the dust buildup and especially the
graphics card how stable is a V stock
power supply well discuss all of that
and more in this video
promising calm is today's video sponsor
and right now they're giving out $5
credit to new accounts and sign up via
the link below so when a nutshell
privacy allows you to purchase things
online using virtual debit cards instead
of a real ones provides a necessary
layer of security that keeps your real
card and bank information hidden from
the transaction using the same security
standards as your bank you can even
download the browser extension and let
it autofill the information for any of
your cards on sites like Amazon it's
easy to use more importantly secure and
100% free thanks to the fact that they
make money on the merchant side the same
way credit agencies do in case you were
wondering how all that works click the
link below and get started today now how
about a slow-mo build log
so this build actually has quite a bit
going forward and the first thing that
probably stood out to you was the fact
that this is as oh tech amp extreme
980ti and a five hundred and twenty
eight dollar bill believe it or not this
card was purchased on eBay for a little
over 200 bucks that's why this total
build price is so cheap I discussed that
card by the way in this video right here
packs the punch similar to a gtx 1070
well consuming just a bit more power
hence why we went with a 600 watt power
supply instead of a 500 watt unit and in
all fairness 500 watts still would have
been fine but under an intense gaming
workload from pulling almost 300 watts
from the wall so are our 514 hundreds
actually keeping total consumption on
the low side even with an overclock to 4
gigahertz we're currently running all in
all though I think is 600 watt power
supply is a better bet it's the
recommended unit recommended wattage and
that's the only one with now I decided
to turn the graphics card vertical in an
effort to minimize card sag this model
92 ci sags a heck of a lot thanks to its
lack of cooler reinforcements toward the
rear i/o plate and at this kit from
Coolermaster solves the problem I would
have used the cable market instead
actually prefer that one more but I was
a bit worried about clearance upfront if
we decided to throw fans near the front
of the case as well only one fan is
included with this case and it's at the
rear as an exhaust so far temps look ok
the system runs very quiet even when
gaming I came for like 3 hours in GTA 5
and it was doing just fine didn't get
very loud at all in temps for under 70 C
for the graphics card I didn't manually
overclock anything on the graphics card
side not that we really need to and of
course the CPU running 4 gigahertz is
pretty sweet considering we using the
stock cooler in an effort to minimize
cost by the way if you must know this is
the thermal take versa in 24 iMessage
thermal take just because I wanted
something that was super cheap and
frankly ugly we're gonna do kind of a
spoof video and I still have plans to do
that with my good friend Brian over at
bps customs so stay tuned for that but
this was one of the only cases I still
had in the garage they hadn't built in
yet and I think it fit the bill I mean
it's not a terrible looking case but
it's definitely not pretty and that's
one of the reasons why I wasn't I
figured we'd have fun with it and again
on top of that buying a use case on a
site like eBay is not recommended
because you're gonna probably end up
paying as much to get the case shipped
to you as you would just buying a new
case from Amazon or new like they have
warehouse is dedicated to you know
housing big products and they have
contracts with UPS and FedEx and USPS
and
how they're able to send this stuff on
the cheap not compared to just your
average consumer who has to pay 30 40 50
bucks to ship just just the case and
nothing else in it just the case within
the continental US so yeah if you want
to send it out of the state forget it
hundreds of dollars but anyway case in
point the case is entirely subjective as
long as it fits the components you have
on hand and has decent air flow
properties in my opinion it doesn't
really matter it's all preferential and
so we had a bit of fun with this one
next up is our used motherboard this is
the MSI be 350 PC mate for some reason
the previous owner had its bar code
removed but other than that this thing
was actually pretty great shape it
almost looked brand new AMD be series
chipsets don't really have the best
power management setups and this one's
really no exception but the autumn temps
they didn't check and I think that's
thanks in large part to the fact that we
run a 1,400 here not something like a
1700 or an 1,800 X or a 2700 those chips
would consume significantly more power
tax was VRMs MOSFETs considerably more
and that would result in much higher
temperatures overall especially on board
but here things are very much in check
and I was actually pleasantly surprised
by how cool the CPU ran even with a 4
gigahertz all core overclock speaking of
the CPU I really tried my best to find a
great deal in Rison 5 1600 I wanted a 6
core variant that seems to be where
games pretty much taper off respect to
how many cores physical cores they'll
utilize but I really couldn't find them
for anywhere less than about 20 bucks
below retail and I didn't feel it was
right risking you know I see if you like
that for a $20 discount so instead I
went with a rise in 514 hundred and I
purchased it on eBay for about 80 bucks
not a stellar deal by any means but I
wanted a modern platform and this was
the price I paid I'm sure you could
probably do better if you're willing to
hop back a few generations I'm not
trying to compete with you there
everyone would probably build a used PC
different if they had the money and the
time to do so
but I wanted something that was
relatively modern again I just wanted
rise in frankly I think rise is a great
value proposition especially used can
still game like a boss and at the same
time we have a few more cores a few more
threads at our disposal for things like
content creation you know you can video
edit with this thing you could even
stream with it if you wanted it's not
something you can do with more of the
know 3 or 4 generation back Intel CPUs
if you want to go like Sandy Bridge Ivy
Bridge you'd have to go with an i7 if
you really want it to be comfortable
video editing on a CPU like that but
here we get the same or similar package
and horizon 5 CPU 480 bucks I think
that's a that's a pretty good deal now
on to the disappointment of this build
that's the ddr4 look I tried very hard
to find a kit that ran it around 3
gigahertz but people were asking
unrealistic prices for them that and
ddr4 in general still very expensive in
most places sooo I settled for a 16 gig
kit of micron modules with the absolute
ugliest aesthetic you can possibly buy
into no heatsinks at all this is bare
green PCB here they aren't even that
fast 226 66 megahertz meaning our risin
5 1400 will struggle a bit but I mean
hey it can be picked up for as little as
seventy bucks for 16 gigs that's not bad
at all so if you're willing to bid on a
few listing you could get lucky and a
lot of these bare-bones kits by the way
ripped out of like old dell optiplex and
gaming desktops so I wouldn't say
they're unreliable microphones a
reliable brand when it comes to memory
modules so no I wouldn't freak out here
buying used memory although if you do
buy a kit and it doesn't work out of the
box you can almost always count on the
eBay buyer protection guarantee to allow
you to get your money back you can just
tell the seller doesn't work as
advertised and that you want your money
back
now the last two components of this
build I strongly recommend buying new
and we'll discuss why shortly first off
the SSD I didn't want a hard drive for a
few reasons but the biggest and probably
most obvious was the fact that boot
times are significantly slower on
comparable hard drives ask anyone he
went from an OS on a hard drive to an OS
on an SSD the difference is night and
day so I hunted eBay for anything in the
500 gig range that was fairly priced I
searched for old 840 Evo's a data
Toshiba drives OC Z's and actually ended
up settling on believe it or not an 860
Evo 500s SD which is the newest SKU in
the Evo series but here are the three
reasons why I would advise purchasing a
new drive versus a used one and firstly
the drives are selling for almost the
same as new ones so like my winning bid
was only 10 bucks under a brand new unit
now it's pretty stubborn I just wanted
to just buy something and get it over
with I was taking forever to find a
drive
so like some of these SSD kits are
actually selling cheaper then I ended up
paying for my used one I think that's a
little ridiculous it really depends on
where you look but for the sake of this
video I had to buy something used so I
went with this one the second reason why
you want to avoid buying and use drive
is that you have absolutely no idea how
many times the drives were erased prior
to reselling so these SSDs have rewrite
limits just like any other Drive and the
more you erase and replace data the more
worn they become this applies especially
to a holder drys it's not a super common
thing for an SSD to fail randomly but
it's definitely more prevalent in older
previously used units and if those
reasons don't end up persuading you
enough the third reason is that you have
absolutely no idea what was previously
all noise drives in fact data could
still be on them when you receive them
some people don't even know how to wipe
a drive so you know it's kind of luck of
the draw their minds seem to be cleared
up when I installed Windows there was
there were no partitions it was just one
big empty volume but there's really no
telling until you open up delete
partitions and start checking things out
again it's kind of a risky thing to to
do you don't know what's on the drive
could be something very malicious could
be something illegal so it's just luck
of the draw that's probably me with a
tinfoil hat but it's possible it's
possible now onto the power supply this
was actually a beef stock EVGA unit
that's why it's not technically used but
it can't be listed as new either for a
few reasons so they may have been
previously purchased and open therefore
they're not new or they could have
manufacturer defects that required
immediate attention they could have been
demo units used for in-house testing etc
so there's really no guarantee that they
weren't used and that's why they're
often just slapped with of the stock
sticker and discounted pretty
substantially in the case of this power
supply here I paid about 15 bucks for it
shipped and that's not bad at all for a
600 watt unit from EVGA I've used this
exact unit before not the exact you made
I should say I'm used to the attacked
model before and it runs very quiet it's
a very reliable cheap power supply and
it's actually I think 80 plus efficient
so it's not like you know some knockoff
brand I mean it comes from EVGA and it
comes with a decent warranty so I would
be perfectly comfortable buying this and
putting it into it seven eight hundred
dollar build so the viability of B stock
units in my opinion really comes
the credibility of the seller this was
shipped from EVGA direct via eBay
listing so I knew that if the unit
didn't work I could just email EVGA a
customer support and fairly quick and
have it resolved now but in this case I
was willing to to risk that right in
order to seize a great deal mom-and-pop
shops though may not hold themselves to
the same standard so you'll want to be
careful when buying other things with
this label attached in a nutshell
however buying used power supplies is
well it's pretty risky huh but and
that's I don't know yeah this is one of
those touchy subjects people tend to
think differently about this but I use
power supply is used right how long was
a run for was it run outside of its
efficiency zone was it running extremely
hot and how was air flow restricted
remember the power supply has the
capacity to take out your entire system
and rarely happens but it still does so
when you choose to buy used you
effectively bump your odds a bit since
the lifespan of that unit is now shorter
like mine buying used in general is kind
of a gamble but I put this entire system
together in this fashion to prove a few
points firstly it can be done and for a
lot cheaper than you think but the two
exceptions power supplies and SSDs are
the two things that I would just be I
wouldn't be willing to risk the
integrity and stability of my system on
those two because for one you could get
most of them almost for the same price
brand-new and typically you have that
the new warranty to go with it and for
two you can't really trust what people
will prior to you we're doing with those
units so yeah how risky do you want to
play it by the way put this entire
system together for probably a lot
cheaper than you think about 500 USD
just a little over that thing shipped it
was about five twenty or five thirty
that's not bad at all for a system with
a ninety atti in it and I'm pushing
excellent frame rates and pretty much
all the games that I tested here in
1440p which is something many systems in
this price range can not say about
themselves the build runs quiet it runs
much cooler than I thought it would
everything appears to be to be stable at
the moment I'll let you know if any of
that changes in the future but with
respect to the 92 TI let's say I didn't
have any issue with dust right when I
first got the card I opened up inspected
it really no dust at all I'm kind of
surprised I think the previous owner
cleaned it before he boxed it up for me
and then the temperatures in the car are
actually fairly low as well despite this
being a beefy 980 TI it still gets
pretty hot it's got a decent manual
overclock applied to it
and it didn't reach 70 degrees Celsius
so that tells me that either this card
was not used for mining which is
probable or that he replaced a thermal
compound before he sent it to me maybe
even both I don't know I don't know if
he would have gone through that much
trouble but I'm comfortable where'd I
put it this way it wasn't dusty enough
to where I felt like I had to take the
whole thing apart and clean it and the
temperatures Warren Hine up where I felt
like I had to take it apart and reapply
thermal compound so that's pretty good
for especially an older card like this
to not have to really worry about much
of that at all although I'm sure in the
very near future I'll take it all apart
anyway just for peace of mind sake
reapply the thermal compound and enjoy
even lower temperatures so to close I'd
like to first say that you could do this
a number of ways okay I really don't
care how you would have done this I know
people were coming I could build the
same system but it'd be you know much
cheaper here or I could build this
system and if you outperform your system
for the same price that's not the point
I'm not trying to say this is the best
$538 build out there I just wanted to
buy a fully used system I wanted all the
components to be used on purpose just to
experiment I mean just to see I mean
like okay if I throw this money out
there what are the odds that I get
something that doesn't work and I would
have documented that but I didn't all
the stuff worked the the sellers for the
most part were reputable I thought that
they were reputable enough to be
purchased from and yeah I have a system
that works and I only paid out of pocket
a little over 500 bucks for it
I really do you think it's okay to take
some risks here and there with respect
to PC components I mean it's your money
spent how you want but that's how I see
I see more value in the use market I
really do the two things I wouldn't risk
used or the power supply in the storage
drive again everything else in my book
is fair game
and the use market is pretty lit right
now don't be afraid to bid here in their
worst case you come home with nothing
but best case you come on something
that's cheaper than it was new and if
push comes to shove you've got the eBay
buyer protection guarantee it's safer in
that sense than Craigslist and provides
the degree of peace of mind when
shopping for used components online what
do you thing about my builder you think
about the video let me know if I give
this one a thumbs up I appreciate it or
a thumbs down if you hate everything
about life or if you feel the complete
opposite about content and saw let you
