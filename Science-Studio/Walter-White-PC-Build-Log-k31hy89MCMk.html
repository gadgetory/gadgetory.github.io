personal rig maybe just starting from
the ground up switching CPUs I try to
Zeon's with 4i v 7s and so this bill
here is is kind of the apex of where I
expect to be for this year and I say
that because I really don't see the
feasibility and going any higher than
this given what I do on my personal rate
course adding a second graphics card
would be I guess you could do it but
given the monitors that I have I really
don't need a second one and the 6700 K
does everything I want it to do I don't
I don't think that purchasing a 6800 K
or maybe a 69 50 X some of those crazy
expensive ones from Broadwell are
justifiable given what I do I do edit in
4k at 30fps
and 60fps and 1080p but the 6700 K is
plenty for that and as long as you have
an adequate amount of RAM on board in
this case I have 16 here I'm probably
going to upgrade that to 32 at some
point but 16 is kind of the bare minimum
for that kind of content creation but
for the most part everything else is
subjective so what you decide to cool
your cpu with what you decide to power
your computer with the graphics card to
an extent depending on what you do with
your computer you play a lot of games
and only 4k monitor then you're going to
want more GPU horsepower than probably
this right here and then a z170
motherboard preferably if you buy
something like this it wouldn't make any
sense to not purchase a z170 motherboard
so that's what we've got here now
something else I've decided to do this
time around is get as many things as
possible to match so there's always
something in the rig that doesn't look
right maybe the RAM or I don't know the
motherboard I have to paint myself so in
this case you all know that I like the
color white because white takes on the
color of any any LEDs that you shine at
it I've decided to go as white as
possible for this rig I was going to
call this video the widest PC build on
YouTube that can be portrayed as kind of
a racial slur so I'm just going to call
it I don't know what I'm gonna call it
go ahead and leave some comments some
suggestions I guess I could call part
two
the finished product whatever you guys
decide to name it but this is a white
motherboard for the most part so the PCB
is actually white as I'll show you here
in a second this is not white but I'm
going to paint it white I painted plenty
of graphics farzam use white engine
enamel the glossy white to make this
thing match everything else the radiator
the actual radiator itself in this cap
in 240 X from deep cool they just
released you can find this part as well
as everything else that you see here in
the video's description the radiator
itself is white which is super cool
super unique I don't know many radiators
are white and then also the the water
block itself or even across the pump
water block combo that is white as well
and there's a white LED inside of that
so yeah everything for the most part is
white or will be white like I want to
paint that and then so that was really
loud white cables from cable mod hook
this up again so we have two six pins
for video we have two eight pins for
video and then one EPS eight pin for the
CPU and a sixth while 16 24 pin for
motherboard power I also threw in a
cable mod Asus or RGB LED strip I don't
know this supports or on board in which
case I won't use the yeah I won't use
the built-in one I'll just plug it into
the motherboard but we'll find out I
mean I don't mind using this I've used
it before perfect for what we plan to do
with this build I don't think I'm going
to turn it any other color other than
white at first maybe I'll get fancy with
it later on but so first thing I'm going
to do is paint that thing I'm gonna
paint that that thing you're gonna paint
the graphics card and then I'll go ahead
and show you that this motherboard is
beautiful you know what I'm gonna show
you right now there are a few like I
guess the columns sand brown colors on
the board that for the most part this
thing is white and that's perfect
so needless to say this board will look
absolutely beautiful I mean really in
any case but especially the one that I
plan on putting in which I haven't
mentioned yet it's the NZXT s340 white
case I'm waiting on it it's not here yet
it should be here
sometimes afternoon I have to walk down
to the post office and pick it up
everything about this board is just
thoroughly thought
I really like it I can't wait to put
this thing together and see what it all
looks like the board isn't really
expensive either so you're probably
thinking well that's a two hundred two
hundred Li motherboard I pick this one
up on Newegg for a hundred and seventy
something dollars US dollars so that's
really not that bad anything in the
hundred dollar price range for a z170
board I would recommend anything over
that you're kind of just paying for the
aesthetics so in this case yeah I did
pay a bit of a premium for the white PCB
but my opinion it was totally worth it
oh my I'm sure a few of you are going to
be very disappointed with my decision to
paint this thing but in the end I think
you're gonna you're gonna see what I
mean
I really think this is gonna look
beautiful and white it already looks
beautiful in black but it's not going to
match really anything in the rig except
for like some of these accents and stuff
so white it is whenever you're doing
something this tedious always be very
very careful of your surroundings so in
this case there are a few screws holding
the fans into place that I do have to
take off and not just screws holding the
fan on but also holding this top shroud
on so you see that screw right in there
very carefully take a screwdriver and
and pull that one out that takes off
this front shroud here see it's almost
off already and then we'll have to take
off the cooler in order to get to the
back plate which I also want to paint so
I'll have to basically disassemble
everything on here before before I can
start painting anything that one was for
the LEDs in the top shroud here that
wire right there is what plugged into
this corner lead here but something else
that I came across is the fact that this
is kind of multi-layered so if you if
you look closely here you can see that
kind of off blackish tan brown gray I
don't know what it is anyway these
pieces here would be really cool looking
if I could just paint those I don't know
if I can take them off though it looks
like they're kind of melted into the the
actual top frame so maybe I can push
those out with the screw I've done it on
the MSI 980ti but I don't know if I can
do it here I don't want to break the
front shroud so we'll see
I decide to do I'm gonna be completely
honest here that looks like some
terrible thermal paste a Seuss what is
going on I'm gonna put our own thermal
paste on here give me one sec to clean
it off with some isopropyl well after
about 20 minutes of prime with this
flat-head screwdriver bit right here I
finally got all six of these pieces off
and this is all I'm gonna paint for the
top of the gph I keep in mind this will
be facing downwards so you really won't
even won't even be seeing it for the
most part but these accents should go
nicely with the back plate which is up
here so I finally took the back plate
off as well I pull it off there's like a
little LED panel thing behind this logo
and that also lights up you can turn
that different colors I set that right
here since there's two LEDs it's really
not there we go
now two LEDs right there and they kind
of just I guess spread out across the
panel and shine through the logo and cut
out on the back plate but anyway we're
going to paint this whole thing and
we're gonna paint these six parts here
and I think that's all we're going to be
painting now yeah I got I got a little
hungry so let's go ahead and take these
outside give them a couple coats of
engine enamel white gloss so I was super
excited about finishing this card up
it's not the best paint job in the world
certainly not my personal best but
everything looks really good I think
that's how its moved from the side from
the top but I forgot one thing and it's
this is going to start okay see
underneath that I'm supposed to have the
LED panel completely forgot to include
it I'm have to take everything off again
to get this back plate off with a PCB to
put this backward goes let's go ahead
and boom case is here folks we're gonna
open that up and start assembling
everything from the ground up see this
is what I have to go through when I
don't have a full time cameraman I could
just use a tripod like I've done in the
past but some reason this just feels
more personal to me
it's not as clean-cut in the end but
well you get you get my voice close-up
closeup into the mic and at the same
time you're getting a first-person
perspective of a what I think would be a
pretty cool PC building and while this
is really difficult to do with one hand
OS 340 how I have missed you a few of
you probably are wondering why I went
with this one instead of my my favorite
P 400 that's because I already bought
the p400 twice and built in it twice and
I feel like going on an old school again
to a good ol s340 I just like the
minimalistic look of this I did as well
of the P 400 and the underglow the p400
has this doesn't have but I think the
white accent in there is going really
good next to the motherboard and I think
the graphics cards gonna look really
sweet next to that here it is as well I
always get excited when it comes to
picking the processor for Bill I mean
that this is really going to determine
what your system can do well and what it
can't do well especially when it comes
to content creation which is what I do a
lot of nowadays and I honestly was
expecting to purchase an i7 6800 K for
this build but after pricing everything
out I mean yeah you're getting two extra
cores and four extra threads but you're
going to pay more for an X 99
motherboard and most of them don't come
in Allen think any x99 motherboard is a
comes in white does it I don't know
maybe there's like one or two but
they're certainly going to be over 200
bucks and on top of that the i7 6700 K
is one of the best processors for gaming
period in most cases I would recommend
an i-5 6600 K and you really will notice
no as much of a difference between that
this but for content creation you want
the best of both worlds and that's what
I think the 6700 K offers and I got this
plus the board on Newegg with a twenty
dollar bonus for for pairing the two for
the bundle so I only ended up paying
about three hundred effective the u.s.
dollars for this and then about 170
bucks for that so 300 bucks for a 6700 K
is a no-brainer in my book if you can
make room for an i7 I recommend it and
if it's only going to be about 60 to 80
bucks more
than an unlocked I five to me again
no-brainer so that's why I won't the 67
okay these are cheaper platforms just
altogether yeah the nice big sockets on
those X I on boards looks so good but
for so much more money we're talking
about two to three hundred bucks more
just to enter x99 territory when you
combine the CPU and motherboard price so
yep as you 170 dues for now it takes a
true Pro to be able to do this with one
hand
where's Golden Arrow so that's right
there on the bottom gonna be going that
way chin there we go
and then tuck her in this right here
folks is what we call tech porn just
straight up nothing dirty just art it's
hard so these aren't white themselves
like the actual frame of these Tim's
aren't white but the LED you've seen
these before on my other rigs the LEDs
inside of these are white so that'll
kind of work right and on top of that
I'm gonna make sure the cards LEDs are
are synced to white as well so we should
have a nice white theme all around
including oh really I hate it when they
do this one that when these right here
aren't retractable so you're just
shoving your dim in on one side and then
having to kind of work it on this side
that's an inconvenience but anyway if I
had the time I would take off these
these covers and paint them as well but
I'm not prepared to use a heat gun to
get these things off they are difficult
to get off without are you gonna know
I've done it before so why aren't you
focusing there we go so I'm just gonna
throw them in as is if it gets annoying
and whatnot I might change of it I think
for the most part it's gonna it'll blend
it and then it's black on the board too
so yeah I'm just gonna keep them the way
they are one other thing about this
board I want to point out a few for
telling me on Twitter how much you like
this board there are so many fan headers
on this thing like you know most cases
you have to buy a fan of if you want to
put more than like four fans in there or
these like a splitter I don't recommend
doing that by the way well in this case
you are not going to have a problem so
good okay when you have a board that
says assistant fan like a lot really
assistant manual I'm just going to call
it a chassis fan or like a CPU to fan or
something come on what is that for
and headers one of them's for a pump but
whatever it's fan header and then
another one here the assistant and then
we have let's see one two three four
five so we have five down here six ten
ten fan headers on this mud of oh whoops
and eleven there's one right here two
eleven fan headers when are you ever
going to use that many fans
I can't imagine ever needing that many
for a z170 platform but hey
saber-tooth hooks you up and keep
yourself nice and cool inside the case
get it because it's a snow theme that
was really it was really cheesy so this
right here folks is the deep cool 240
e^x they're brand new 240 millimeter
all-in-one radiator water cooler combo
and see we had a white block on top it
looks like the fluid is a is tinted some
kind of dark kind of it's actually the
fluid itself or it's just the tent of
the of the tubing but the whole cooler
is just perfect absolutely perfect for
this bill look at the radiator the
radiator itself is white even the fins
are white that is so cool and the fans
included are in a white frame they have
a unique little blade design in they're
not going to be the quietest but we can
tune that in the computer itself from
game or storm courses of their game or
storm series so from the side but the
fans in you'll see nothing but white and
also from the inside of the case nothing
but white along with the white water
block and pump integrated in there as
well that is super cool yeah I really
can't wait for this end this is this
whole build I don't know if you guys are
seeing it yet but this whole build is is
gonna look so cool in all white I think
this is going to be one of the widest PC
builds ever on YouTube and that's thanks
to a lot of different parts kind of
working together and a bit of
customization on on my part and there it
is installed so I have the fans pulling
here in from this side sorry the couch
is really
it's really noisy and they're pulling in
from this side it's going to push
through the radiator fins into the case
now there will be a bit of hot air in
here but that's better than exhausting
air out this side we're having the fans
on this side and I guess pulling area
and I prefer push and that's what
they're doing they're pushing air
through the radiator yeah either way
you're going to be choking the graphic
spread so I'd rather have air here for
the graphics card to to pull even if
it's going to be pretty hot so this has
got to be one of the best AIO cooler
designs ever I mean that's so painless
and it you know it's secure once you
have all all those screws tucked in and
just secure the block itself only to so
it's super easy to pull off not really
like that design so here's what it looks
like so far folks as you can see white
that is the point I think it's looking
really good so one other thing that I
tried to match with the rest of the
build was the solid state drive it is a
240 gig and you can you can mount too
right here so one's definitely going
right there if I get a second one later
on I'll put it beside it but check this
out so I got the Toshiba Tryon Trianon
how I say it but boom now you tell me
that huh huh that's pretty good right
that's pretty close actually the the
gray is almost perfect it's almost the
exact same color so I think this is
gonna go well with the rest of the bill
okay up next is the power supply one
thing before I go ahead and install that
I have a Wi-Fi card I know it's hard to
tell but I painted the top of that PCB
black I use Plasti Dip so it's not gonna
be conductive I don't recommend doing
this normally but it's a Wi-Fi card
something happens to it it's like 20
bucks so I'm not too worried about it
but it was a green board and that didn't
anything in here so yeah now it's black
it's nice and subtle ish and it looks a
lot better than it did when it was a
green as for the power supply this is
the 600 watt modular power supply from
deep cool that I told you originally was
going to McLovin I decided to keep it
for this build here now deep cool is
sending a 1000 watt power supply and I'm
gonna put it in this rig that's because
I have a special plan for this thing I'm
gonna need
to power maybe not a thousand watts of
it but future proof and power proof for
sure
so this one is modular as you can see
now the cable mod cables are not
designed specifically for this so I had
to buy extensions that they don't offer
cables for this particular modular power
supply from deep pool so we're going to
be using these included modular cables
we're just going to have to use the
excess cable in here and then tie the
extensions from the cable mod kit on the
ends of these and plug those into the
leads on the computer another cool thing
I didn't mention about the this power
supply here is that all of these modular
cables that are included with the PSU
are black so they're all black sleeve
you don't have to worry about that
yellow and red ketchup and mustard look
also decided to paint these so these are
the SSD trays that go right here on top
of the basement one of these will be
occupied for now the other one might be
later on but yeah so something else to
kind of go along with the white theme
here and okay I think I've plugged
everything in if I missing something
I'll know right away but this is it this
is the final product as you can see yeah
mostly mostly white I did I farmed
something right here I I don't know what
I did to do this but I ended up scraping
some paint off of the back plate so I
had to improvise and kind of paint over
that with what I had so it's not the
cleanest looking it wasn't originally
but it's certainly not now but from a
good two feet away it looks nice and
clean so it's like a two foot mud I
guess but everything in there is just so
color coordinated it's I I really like
the way that it did it looks I think I'm
gonna like it even more when we turn it
on I did put one of these TF 120 s in
the air from deep pool from the gamer
storm series as well as a fan text fan
up top 140 to kind of fill in the whole
gap up here because that was just my OCD
was kicking in and then of course the
white radiator and a water loop from
deep cool I think that is the that's the
pinnacle of this build I really like the
the black cables here in contrast
the white pump and the all-white
radiator that is so cool-looking so
hopefully it boots up hopefully we have
any problems let's see what it looks
like with the lights on and one last
thing right here it's always tough
getting this thing perfect yeah
well ya know that looks like straight
these are a big deal to me
I like to have these on my builds this
is just just let you know what you're
packing inside
speaking of which he or she is folks oh
yeah so uh this was originally red and
you can change this with their or a
software just go ahead and download it
online and you can customize this
something that's a little strange to me
the top of it let me turn down the
exposure the top of it is one color so
you set you set the color in the app but
then the top of it is the color that you
set it to but then the sides here are
actually a deviation of that color so
for instance on top here it's like an
aqua marine ish blue-green color and on
the bottom it's strictly blue like
there's no green at all in it so it just
kind of deviates from the original color
scheme you select in the app at least
here on the sides and on the bottom even
though you really can't see the bottom
in this case that would be something to
note if you're planning on purchasing
this particular 1070 featuring a su Sora
other than that I am very happy with the
build there we go so it looks super
orange everywhere else in the room but
in the case you're seeing a truer color
and this by the way can be changed with
the included remote that that will come
with any cable mod RGB kit not RGB strip
but RGB kit so that's white new red
let's see green is a blue here that's
super blue in the camera a while that is
a yellow believe it or not but that
looks pretty white here in the camera
it's a white balance issue and then it's
a lighter blue it's like a Bluegreen
almost and then a purple color all in
all very very happy with the bill that I
will post
benchmarks is very soon I know you guys
are really wondering what this thing can
do so I'm going to put it through put it
through all of my games that I have on
Steam maybe buy a few extras and start
testing with those as well too because
I'm kind of falling behind in terms of a
modern game so I'll do that um you go
one last shot
that's that's er I don't know what I
want to call it I want you guys to tell
me what you think this should be called
so leave a comment with a name
suggestion my brother said something
like Arctic tundra or frozen tundra I
don't have something snow assure or snow
ash one come on Greg something that has
to do with one of the Arctic the snow
ice something like that those would be
my suggestions stick within those realms
although you could come up with
something else that who knows I may like
it so that's it thanks for sticking
around and watching the build log I know
this was interesting and the
first-person perspective is not too
often that we do something like that on
the channel but I'm still trying to work
on some things I usually do the tripod
mount and you guys just watch me put it
together via tripod but I wanted to see
if you guys prefer this style or if you
prefer that style to be completely
honest with you doing it this way is a
lot easier because I can just crop and
crop and crop and it's fine no big deal
but when I have it on a tripod I have to
consistently move things around I have
to I have to find the exact place where
I want to crop it I have to blend it in
I have to do voiceovers that's a that's
a whole other thing I have to do I have
to use the microphone and do voiceovers
so that takes up a lot of time too if I
do it in a vlog style which I've noticed
a lot of tech tubers have been doing
that recently it just makes things to go
by a lot smoother for me in the editing
process maybe that's why they're doing
it's just easier on that too so I see
that now but let me know what you think
about this build the build long the
series itself and let's put it through
some benchmarks in the next video shall
we
thanks for watching this is science
