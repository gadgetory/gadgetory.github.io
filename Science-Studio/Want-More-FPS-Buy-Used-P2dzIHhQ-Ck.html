the one you saw in the last video we put
it together for about eight hundred
bucks and I used the only new components
because yeah some people just don't like
buying use they get a little
apprehensive and I I don't blame them
right it's your money spend it where you
think it's best spent if you don't trust
the use market then yeah again it's your
decision but I always try to give you an
option to buy used I always mention it
or at least try to in videos like these
because I feel like it's some of the
some stuff is just too good to pass up
right like this whole build here for 800
bucks I could have built used and it
would cost maybe 600 bucks right you're
getting a decent discount that's assume
you can get a used 1660 for a decent
deal this is kind of a new card so you
finally find them too cheap but you can
find better cards than the 1660 for
cheaper than the price of a new 1660 so
yeah that's the use market for and I'm
gonna show you exactly what that could
do to a build like this if you decide to
buy in particular a used graphics card
now what do I mean by a used graphics
card well it had to have been in a
system prior to when you bought it it
has miles think of it like a car it's
been on the highway it's been in the
city and yeah it's been through the
wringer that's the risk behind it it's
why people don't like to buy used
components because they're not sure how
the previous owner handled the product
now in the case of this card right here
maybe JSC GT x 1080 the founders PCB
comes with a backplate some of these
don'ts so if you if you want a backplate
make sure you get a picture that shows
this otherwise ask the seller directly
if you're gonna buy from eBay or maybe
even like you used from Amazon but this
card right here stays well within safe
temps it was already clean when it was
sent to me so that was nice it had to
take it apart I don't need to replace
the thermal compound because the GPU
temps are in check
it has the thermal pads as well which is
nice so it's it's been very well
maintained and I was sure to do due
diligence before actually sending the
seller some money so that he could send
me the the card and I'm very happy with
his purchase again about 300 bucks for
this
this card new was like 400 450 bucks I
don't really remember but 300 is a
decent discount for a card that barely
even looks used I mean I came with a box
too so you could probably package this
and nobody would be the wiser so the
point of this video is to show you how
much more performance you can get out of
a used car now you can find this around
300 bucks yeah it's a little more than
the 1660 you could throw a 1072 this rig
and that'll cost sometimes less than a
new 1660 and a 10-7 he's gonna blow this
one out of the water the big difference
there so a 1080 it's just another step
in the right direction if we wanted to
cheap out just a little more something
else maybe cheap out on the storage a
bit we could go with maybe a 120 gig SSD
and then like a 1 terabyte hard drive
that would save us some cash we could
also get a cheaper case I wouldn't
recommend cheeping out a little anymore
on the power supply
Phebe you don't like tough boards I
totally understand that at the RM power
delivery on these boards it's not that
great this is a 65 watt chip though the
2600 it just zips on power we're not
manually overclocking it's a fine board
but we could cheap out of the board just
a bit more and that could be another way
to save some money but however you need
to justified in your head on a balance
sheet what-have-you I think it's worth
considering the used market and if you
can squeeze out just a bit more to get a
card like a 10-8
that is going to be a night and day
difference between this and the 1660 and
I'm gonna show you that right now
first up is again Witcher 3 the GTX
1660s on the Left averaging around 55 to
60 fps pretty decent for a game like
Witcher 3 can very graphically intensive
GPU utilization up top is maxed out
practically but again on the right side
same story right she takes 10 DB still
being essentially maxed out 97 98
percent but our frame rate is
significantly higher about 80 to 85 fps
on average this is exactly what we want
to see in for around a $70 graphics card
upgrade this is pretty good pub G is
next 1440p medium preset on the left
we're getting about a hundred FPS that
will vary slightly especially we're
going into forests and stuff with grass
that framerate will drop just a bit
this is pubs you we're talking about
it's gonna be a little spotty here and
there it's still not very well optimised
but you can see on the right side a
noticeable improvement that she takes 10
ADC yielding around 120 to 130 FPS and
you can see now we're outside at frame
rate on the Left dropped to under 100
FPS so we're still well above 100 and GT
X 1080 side and that is definitely good
news
sorry by the way if this is a little
confusing to look at I just want you to
pay attention to the utilizations and
framerate doom in the Vulcan API is up
next over 100 FPS so the 1660 does very
well here the Vulkan API is a very
beautiful API and then the GTX 10d on
the writes about a 150 fps or so so
noticeable improvement not as much of an
improvement visually just because we're
already at such a high frame rate to
begin with but I do want you to notice
CPU utilization is slightly higher on
the right side and that is due in part
to the fact that we're running at a
higher frame rate last up here is
Assassin's Creed Odyssey I had to drop
the resolution to 1080p to keep us
around 60 FPS for the 1660 GP
utilization is still around 95% but
again it doesn't change when we when we
throw in a GTX 1080 so technically still
GPU bound in this scenario SAS escrito
so you still I would say a fairly
unoptimized it's a relatively new game
so I expect what time this will get
better but we're seeing about a 15 to 20
FPS bump between the 1660 and the 1080
something else to notice is that our CPU
utilization all of our 12 threads are
being utilized just a bit more
on the right side and that's because we
are pushing again more frames and that
is a story of how we upgraded an $800 PC
with about a $300 used graphics card and
just wrecked this 1660 now it's not fair
to compare an 80 Series card with a 60
series card and that's basically what
this is I'm not trying to knock on this
if you want to buy new this is I mean
you could probably squeeze out an RT X
2060 we really wanted an $800 budget but
you'd be making some arguably pretty
serious compromises but if you buy used
then the whole game changes and at that
point you can get a lot better bang for
your buck
I'll be it with a slight risk seeing as
though you don't really know the person
who you are buying the card in question
from if you ask me the used market is a
way to go if you're gonna build anything
under about a thousand USD I think you
should strongly consider the use market
for especially the graphics card and
maybe even the platform it's willing to
go back just a couple of generations I
wouldn't go back further than as well
and I really wouldn't consider bulldozer
piledriver so the FX series AMD CPUs I
would stay away from but first gen
rhizome is still fair game in my book
the rise in five 1600 is still being
sold new in a few cases for around a
hundred bucks which is really good but
yeah that's just my take on it again
this is a subjective thing everyone's
gonna handle the use market differently
some won't even touch it at all and it's
your money you can do what you want with
it but if I had to build this system and
I was allowed to play in the used market
and I would allow myself to do that
because I have before and I've had
fairly good experiences throughout I
would ditch the 16 60 or even a 16 60 TI
or even an RT X 20 60 in favor of a used
GT X 1080 what do you guys think let me
know in the comments below guys forget
thumbs I thought it was cool thumbs down
for the opposite but the red subscribe
button if you haven't already become a
member if you're feeling especially
fancy and I'll catch you in the next one
this is science studio thanks for
watching and thanks for then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
