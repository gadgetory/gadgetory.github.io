personal car if you're wondering what I
paid for this is about twenty two
thousand five hundred USD which I think
is a really good price considering what
you're getting so in this video I'm
going to show you around the Carl talk
about its quirks and features and I'll
also be hinting on a few things that I
think computer enthusiasts would enjoy
this is a car review by a computer guy
now starting first off with
specifications I couldn't know it
matters the most of you right you want
to know what the spec sheet is like this
is sporting a true 8 cylinder engine ok
none of that four-cylinder turbocharged
stuff this is a true 8 core I mean 8
cylinder engine since the v8 bench you
got it you got always put the badge up
there you got to let people know you
have a v8 and this is making about 350
horsepower and that's stock and that is
out of the factory so it's probably
close to 320 now it still feels very
powerful it's a very responsive engine
despite being the older 4.2 liter model
if you want to go with the rs5 which
would be a step up from this then you
have the new 4.2 liter engine which you
can find also in the v8 outtie r8 now in
case you're wondering yes this engine is
water-cooled we have a very large
radiator up front we do not have a dust
filter so dust buildup is an issue I'll
show you that in a second that's really
the only downside to the front of the
car these large grille slots here really
don't do much in the way of protecting
the radiator from pulling anything
that's not supposed to be in there from
actually getting in there
but apart from that we do have a very
nice closed loop in here to keep that
engine running nice and cool now the
hydraulic on this car's hood is shot
it's been like that since day one of me
purchasing it and unfortunately there is
no manual lever included because right
out he's just too good for that I guess
so I have to hold this thing here and
it's quite heavy now fortunately I
haven't had to do any serious
maintenance on the engine the only thing
I've really had to do in here apart from
what I need to do which is clean the
thing is included tea splitter through a
four vacuum hose which is supposed to go
back to the mufflers and that in the our
metric system controls the valve so you
can open and close the muffler valves in
there for a loud or quiet sound and
that's actually right here I'm surprised
this hasn't melted yet because it's
sitting right on top of the block jeez
but regarding the block itself this is
the 4.2 liter v8 engine that has been
used since as far back as I believe like
2004
the old school are Sforza's ass exact
engine now that engine was actually
plagued with timing chain tensioner
issues try saying that ten times really
fast and basically what happens is that
you have a bunch of plastic guides that
route the timing chain there's a couple
of them back there but basically those
will snap or weaken and then your whole
engines gone kaput because you know if
you don't have the timing chains
functioning properly then your valves
don't open properly and your whole
engine basically shuts down and Fries
and yeah it's it's just one big mess now
in the past I always like to badge my
cases I mean cars but you won't find
anything like that on this car save the
two Audi logos one at the front one at
the rear and also the two v8 badges the
one to keep those there because there is
a difference between the v8 out es5
which was circa 2008 to 28 2011 actually
2012 the last year that came out and
then 2013 started the 3.0 supercharged
v6 engines which I don't think are as
cool because I mean they're not v8 other
than that the stock s5 badges both at
the front and rear have been removed to
keep people guessing they look at this
car and they wonder what the heck it is
and that's kind of the point now in
terms of the chassis things are very
stable here thanks to four large
rubberized feet you will need to replace
them though you can't just you know
leave them on forever and just expect
them to last and with my driving in mind
yeah they need to be replaced right
about now these rims by the way are not
stock they're supposed to mimic the rs5
rims those are 20-inch rims these are
only 19's here from Hartman
oh there it is yeah this is the problem
with living next to two air force bases
that's pretty common although it is the
sound of freedom these rims by the way
are supposed to mimic the rs5 rims which
are actually 20 inches in diameter these
are only 19's they're Hartman
aftermarket rims for sure but they are
very sturdy they're a pain to clean they
get very dirty because brake dust
buildup is just inevitable especially
with these brakes and brake discs Wow
now come on only thing is the brake
discs and the calipers build up quite a
bit of dust on these so they get very
dirty very quick maybe in the future
we'll go to like some oszi racing or BBS
rims and we'll darken them a bit a lot
of people ask me what I expect the
current RGB trend in the PC industry to
be replaced by in 2018 and 2019
my prediction Chrome there's quite a bit
of it here we have chrome mirrors we
have chrome trim around the door sills
around the windows we also have a little
bit of chrome up front and of course
chrome rims so it all kind of blends
together and that's one of the main
reasons why I haven't decided to paint
anything on the case I mean on the car
the rims themselves could probably be
dark in just a bit but for now I think
chrome fits the overall color scheme
quite nicely now at the rear this
chassis you will find something else
that is not stock these are aftermarket
exhaust tips from armytrix the entire
system actually the entire exhaust
system up to the headers essentially a
catback system here runs through the
entire bottom side of the car it's kind
of a shame that you can't see the
beautiful chrome accents underneath
because everything else under the car
looks really nasty except for for these
pipes and I will say that the sound is
beautiful this really makes that v8
engine come alive the stock system was
really quiet you know people in the PC
industry want a really quiet system well
if you have a v8 engine you probably
want it to sound pretty loud especially
if you're a young guy like I am you want
to really show off what you got under
the hood that's what this allows you to
do you can actually open and close the
valves as well I have a full on video on
this by the way if you want to check it
out but this is probably my favorite
part of the car apart from just the the
looks overall is this exhaust system I
really love the way it sounds with the
valves both open and closed
now another important aspect of any
computer I mean car is its interior how
you make things look on the inside can
make as big a difference as how the case
itself looks or the chassis looks on the
outside and this is a very very clean
interior time was definitely definitely
taken to make sure that this looked as
good as possible given this cars price
point I think that this is probably one
of the nicest interiors on a twenty
thousand dollar car used or new that you
can buy today this leather is no
exception I wouldn't put the red leather
here because red looks good really on
anything and it makes it feel a bit more
classy and upper-end than the typical
black or white leather with an Audi now
just because I think chrome is the way
of the future that does not mean that I
don't have integrated LEDs onboard these
headlights here look pretty sweet these
are these go back really as far as the
2008 out erh they were incorporated in
the s5s right after that and they've
been doing tricky things with them since
then but I think this is the cleanest
headlight design so far the 2013 era rs5
and s5 look pretty sweet as well but I
like just the subtle scoop underneath
and you can always turn them off if you
don't like them I don't know why you'd
want to do that but you do have the
option in the MMI system something else
worth pointing out this card is equipped
with pretty sweet graphics you have the
navigation system built-in you can
really go through pretty much whatever
you want with your car you can control
you know engine gearbox your steering
the sport differential it is included in
this car switch it from comfort to
dynamic it's very strange I thought I
had that in comfort before it's a 2 Auto
yes we'll leave it there I keep the
engine gearbox in comfort because it
shifts pretty hard nice when you swing
it too dynamic just you know so you
don't want to shock people too much or
make them think that the gearbox is not
functioning properly steering and
keeping comfort because if you put it in
dynamic it is a pain like a royal pain
to turn this thing I do wish this car
had the flat-bottom steering wheel like
the the 2013's 5s do it's one thing that
I would like to replace the problem is
the steering wheels cost like $1,000 and
wouldn't seen in the context of the
entire price of this car I'm not a fan
of paying 1/20 of this cars price just
for a steering wheel now this car does
have a speed warning so basically when
you're CP I mean your your engine gets a
little too hot you go a little too fast
this thing will pop up and tell you that
your your going way too fast and
you're gonna be in some trouble soon so
of course I never use this because you
know what overclocking enthusiast does
but if you do want to overclock this
beast there's something to be mindful of
it's not yeah it's not the most
intuitive thing ever but it is hair and
I think it's pretty funny that it's a
speed warning so for any parent out
there who wants to purchase this car for
whatever reason for your teenage son or
daughter you can monitor their speed
right here that's something else this
chassis has a built-in SD card reader
actually two of them so if you want to
run I don't know you could like upload a
map or something with this one and then
listen to tunes on this one or transfer
files you can definitely do that here
not sure what the storage space is in
this thing but you do have two slots
here really nice to see a chassis with
two SD card slots don't see that too
many times nowadays now I'm not sure how
many of you saw our CES coverage but if
you did you likely saw the deep pool
quad stellar case they have basically a
vent system that allows the chassis to
pull in more air if you are desiring
that if your CPU is running a bit hot
you can definitely let it more that way
or you could close the whole system this
kind of reminds me of that so if you
need more air in your chassis then you
can just open the thing up please don't
mind the convertible 328i BMW that just
passed all you guys that little slip
back there it doesn't really do much in
the way of acting as a sunroof but at
least you have that button this by the
way just you push it and you close it
simple as that
well I hope you've enjoyed my
perspective this review so far I think
we're gonna end it here I will say just
as a closing remark that I am very
satisfied with the driving experience
and just owning this car overall for the
past six months I hope for the next six
months that it will remain strong and
not break because if it does I will be
in the hole probably five or six grand
at least and that's you know a fifth or
fourth of the value of the car so at
that point I'm gonna be really really
frustrated and bitter but for the time
being it's driving fun and I really
enjoy driving it just finding an excuse
to take it out on the road is a it's
always a blast so with that if you liked
the video be sure to give us one a
thumbs up I appreciate it thumbs down
for the opposite click subscribe button
if you haven't already in stay tuned for
well not more content like this don't
worry more car reviews aren't on the way
I just figured I would you know have fun
reviewing a car for once this is this is
my car I love it and I didn't pay much
for it which i think is really cool I
was it was a good find and so far it's
serving me well this is science studio
thanks for driving with us
