heck xlr8 is well they're PNY now with
the dedicated gaming division so if you
see this name you'll know they're all
about PC gaming
they manufacture everything from SSDs to
RAM to graphics cards and on that note
in light of blue skies overkill spec
sheet I asked them to send a GTX 1060
budget-friendly alternative for the
1080p in light 1440p gamer my first
impression looks pretty dope accelerate
proudly boasts the black and red color
scheme a bit cliche sure but consistent
to say the least you won't have an issue
finding hardware to match a brief
summary of the spec sheet upfront most
of you know by now a 1060 is a 1060 1280
CUDA cores a boost clock of 1797
megahertz which is a mild jump from the
reference frequency and six gigabytes of
vram the card utilizes a single 8 pin
also a bump from the stock 610 but still
sits on power in relation to previous
generations lengthwise the cards a
little under nine and a quarter inches
so it should fit in most ITX cases it
comes with a backplate a staple in my
book but with backwards writing that I
wish they'd rotate around you'll find
red LEDs under the two fans along with
the prominent gtx 1060 logo up front my
only complaint here the weird extrusion
the frame it serves no functional
purpose as far as I can tell and could
potentially limit case compatibility
especially with that left side panel
other than that build quality is on
point the shroud isn't flimsy and the
cooler underneath sports copper pipes
and aluminum sinks the kind of
combination for which you'll want to
look temperatures under load at stock
never past 75 C even in a small
form-factor case with minimal airflow
the fans do crank up quite a bit though
with the stock curve not as loud as the
founder's edition of course but will
become audible at around 30% fan speed
by default the card will never pass 50 C
unless you're doing something very
insane with your graphics card and the
sound was still tolerable in fact most
hard drives are louder than this card is
under load almost always a part of third
party coolers now let's talk performance
if you see gtx 1060 reviews in the past
this one's probably nothing new in terms
of frame rates anyway I ran the latest
geforce driver 370 eight point seven
eight and four different games which
pull pc resources and unique ways the
computer in question my ITX pc build
from a few months ago it's boarding an
i-5 7600 k clock to four point four
gigahertz and
sixteen gigabytes of 2.8 gigahertz ddr4
pairing a gtx 1060 with something like
an i7 7700 k or an i7 5820k wouldn't
really make much sense in the real world
so we won't be doing that here a card
this size fits with plenty of room to
spare even in something as compact as
this fractal design note - oh - after a
quick boot and driver install it was off
to the races now seeing as though this
is my first official benchmarking video
of a gtx 1060 which is kind of hard to
believe just never owned one until now I
was actually pleasantly surprised
I was running each of these games and at
least the ultra preset in 1080p
something my old GTX 970 could barely
handle and was impressed by what I saw
first up Witcher 3 received a
respectable frame rate we didn't reach
60fps on average but bear in mind this
is witcher 3 on ultra which will tax the
living hell out of any modern GPU and at
that 39 ain't bad for a minimum i
expected worse moving on a GTA 5 good ol
69 on average 47 for the men GT 5s an
excellent example of balance between GPU
and CPU intensities gameplay was smooth
and rich especially with everything
maxed out save anti-aliasing battlefield
1 is another beautifully optimised game
and my experienced minimums and averages
are always very close that's exactly
what you want to see a staggering 86 on
average here is superb for a card in the
mid $200 price range lastly a CPU
intensive title cities skylines won't
tell us much about how powerful the
graphics card is other than to say that
you could swap this card for one three
times its price and you likely won't see
much of a difference in framerate making
the 1060 a sweet spot for most gamers in
1080p it is no secret at this point that
the aurochs 480 is a very compelling
competitor we asked a roomful of a
hundred people which one they would
prefer I'm sure around 50% would say the
AMD card the other 50% would say Nvidia
for various reasons I prefer Nvidia for
their software but I prefer AMD for
their value it just comes down to which
one you weigh more but if you ask me
this particular card I think could look
a bit better but it definitely falls
into the gtx 1060 sweet spot in terms of
price it's also manufactured by a
reputable brand I use PNY SSDs all the
time so if you're in the market for a
green team car that looks favorably on
your budget this 1060 here is the way to
go and as always you can find links to
the card showcased in this video
in the description both my Amazon and
Newegg affiliate links are tied to those
so if you do purchase something via the
link I do get a small kickback it goes a
long way I do appreciate it
it just won a thumbs up inside it was
cool thumbs down for the opposite click
a subscribe button if you haven't
already I will catch you in the next
video this is Salazar studio thanks for
