mean sure it'll ensure that every game
that you play has a sufficient number of
threads to work with I mean 24 threads
that's a ton but even the 3700 ex checks
those boxes with 8 cores and 16 threads
and a considerably lower price tag more
on that in this video right here but the
3900 X is special because it's
technically the world's first 12 core
consumer grade CPU and it's priced
rather competitively in my opinion at
$4.99 it packs 70 megabytes of combined
l2 and l3 cache max boost frequency of
4.6 gigahertz which comes in handy for
some more gaming benchmarks especially
and a reasonable 105 watt TDP so how
does the stack up against intel's
comparably priced in 9900 K and should
you consider
if you're looking for crisp audio in a
comfortable set of cans from a reputable
company checkout Sennheiser's HD 58 x
jubilee headset from drop thanks to new
150 ohm drivers you can enjoy clean
audio from virtually any source
including your smartphone with extended
bass and a defined upper mid-range
you'll also welcome the julies
incredible dynamic range meaning you can
crank these babies up for undistorted
uninterrupted unconditionally clean
sound have I sold you yet you can find
the HD 58 x jubilee from drop that's
formally mass drop linked below now so
briefly run through our testbench
again we've got two gigabyte X 570 or
master which handles the 12 core giant
with ease I didn't note this in our last
review but we were running and are
running currently for these tests the f5
see a BIOS revision because BIOS is tend
to affect results just slightly you'll
see stock and manual overclock runs here
and depending on the title you'll find
the 3900 X does sufficiently well at
stock where precision boost and exif r2
are allowed to tailor individual core
frequencies to better suit workloads the
same 16 gig could've tried NZ ddr4 was
used with XMP enabled the graphics card
used throughout was an asus strix 2080
our boot drivers of course their MP 600
compatible of pci hn4 and our library
was stored on a 2 terabyte TT blue hard
drive in front all these parts linked
down below the 3900 X is an absolute
slayer in Cinebench r20 which utilizes
each thread to render parts of an image
CPS with more threads are allowed to
render smaller parts of the image
simultaneously which means CPS with more
cores typically do better in this test
Geekbench 4 reveals a similar story our
single core scores are still a bit shy
of the 9900 KS but another thing you're
likely to notice here is how the stock
run of the r9 chip is outperforming the
overclocked run this is something we
intermittently saw in our 3700 X review
as well long story short these then two
chips aren't excellent overclockers a
lot of this has to do with how
aggressive precision boost is by default
and while 12 cores sounds lovely on
paper in practice many programs still
benefit from the occasional single or
dual core boost in frequency we
discussed more of that in this video
right here I'm pointing to the same
videos I did last time I'm just
emphasizing it because if you haven't
seen these yet it explains why you're
seeing what you're
so with that said the next few
productivity benchmarks you'll see will
be depicted at stock that not get 100k
sure could still benefit from a small
boost in overall frequency with a manual
overclock and so what I did instead was
enable MCE and it was disabled again for
our gaming benchmarks so all that's
because we showed overclocked and stock
runs in the gaming benchmark so I'll let
you know when we make that switch back
blender was our next test and here the
3900 X dominated the ring in the BMW
render which is a lot like cinnamon in
the way behaves more cores and a solid
frequency push AMD's r9 shift to render
times of only 168 seconds of there
abouts compared to our 9900 K at 220
seconds almost 1 minute slower the 3700
X mind you is not far behind that next
up this content creation I could have
used DaVinci Resolve or Sony Vegas for
these tests but a popular platform I've
used for years is Adobe Premiere Pro I
know how these chips behave typically
with the software suite so I know what
to expect and it's easy to explain it
isn't the most reliable in terms of
stability we're talking about the
software itself but it's functions are
powerful and that's why I use it what
you're looking at here are a render
times for the same a 5-minute 4k video
clip using the YouTube before K 40 mega
40 megabits scuse me per second preset
now at first glance you might think
something's wrong 999 hundred K results
in fact I noticed a few reviewers
showing the 1900 K behind the 3900 X in
similar premiere tests however in my
case I was sure to enable Hardware
encoding which requires the install and
activation of Intel u HD graphics there
are typically drivers involved along
with a bios toggle so it's a multi-step
process that said it works wonders here
and I'm getting less than a minute for
minute render time per minute of footage
on my timeline with the 1900 K and this
is something comparable AMD chips simply
cannot take part in for that reason and
that reason alone I haven't switched to
arisin or Zen 2 for my personal editing
rig but will still find plenty of use
for a 12 core around the office and to
be completely honest said they're gonna
hundred X and even the 3700 X
aren't terrible in this test so if
you--if you wanted to go with this for
kind of an awesome all-arounder at a
better price in my opinion then this
would totally make sense so you could do
it
a lot alive with 12-course the same
general rules apply for the next test
warp stabiliser is a built-in video
effect that it attempts to basically
smooth out rough and bouncy footage and
here the core I nine and ninety-nine
hundred K comes out on top after six
hundred frames but the 3900 X comes
awfully close I should note that the IGP
isn't being used as heavily during this
task here during warp stabilizing it's
used a lot heavy it's used to a greater
extent I should say in the render
scenario so that is why the 99 rotate
doesn't have as much of a lead as it did
in the prior test I should also note
that without the IGP the core I nine
would lose handily but I'm not gonna get
the Intel chip especially given the fact
that I used this hardware acceleration
on a near-daily basis I just feel like
that would be unfair for the blue team
if these had I GPS
I'd be using them too I will say however
that other editing Suites like DaVinci
Resolve a generally favored higher core
pounce in general in which case I would
expect the 3900 X to render and warp
faster so it all really depends on the
programs of which you take advantage
that's no surprise really
speaking of advantage streaming is
likely to be a popular use case for the
CPU and really any of these CPUs on this
chart the 3900 X to my surprise didn't
improve much in the way of streamer side
fps but no drop frames were observed for
any of these tests on the viewer side
which is good this was with the x264
encoder by the way I don't typically use
in bank with you know gaming streaming
it just doesn't make sense to me I would
rather use x264 especially about a
higher core count CPU so in short your
outcomes will largely depend on the
games you play GTA v doesn't tend to
saturate 16 threads so additional
headroom can be levy to by the encoder
and virtually no expensive framerate
well ok there there's like around a 10
percent dip overall when compared to our
raw GTA 5 benchmarks but it isn't
something you're likely to complain
about when your viewers are seeing a
buttery smooth 60fps stream my
recommendation if you're gonna be just
streaming and gaming and you want to buy
a new CPU that 3700 X is the best value
of the law in 3dmark times by the 3900 X
is 12 cores comes in handily actually
edging out a victory over all thanks to
a crispy CPU score pushing overall score
as well in excess of 11,000 points the
9900 K + 30
our necks are neck and neck and the 2700
X suffers to an extent on account of IPC
and boost clocks by the way the 3,700 X
9900 K and 27 X results that you see
from here on out will be with the stock
run so no MCE enabled as well as the
overclocked 5 gigahertz 4.3 and 4.2
respectively and these are the exact
same results you saw in our 3700 X
review your Eastside GTA 5 in this video
but imma show it again along with a
side-by-side comparison of a game play
between the 3700 X 3900 X and a 9900 K
I'm getting so tired of saying these
names by the way you're only gonna see
the first 16 threads because showing 24
in the case of the 3900 X required me to
shrink this font down to a point where
it have been pretty difficult to you on
certain devices needless to say you can
see that several threads that you can
see bounce in and out of existence so
having twenty four threads instead of
you know 16 isn't really going to change
much in the way of performance for this
game this trend continues by the way to
other games as well we saw a small
improvement in fortnight but nothing
worth freaking out about our 9900 K
retain the lead among averages and the
lowest 1% of frames and the 3900 X
offered only a small improvement over
its 8-core counterpart Resident Evil was
a similar story in fact for some reason
our 3900 X performed worse overall even
after three averaged runs which all of
these are by the way we averaged three
different frame times across the entire
frame spectrum so some of these
benchmarks and choreo recorded like
thousands of frames we averaged all
those frame times and they come up with
a standardized average that you're
seeing here in these graphs but if we
have outliers like an occasional it'll
be like a random spike out of nowhere
and it only shows up in one test and no
other CPUs exhibit this then we get rid
of that we throw that out we consider it
an outlier and so that's the whole thing
if it's repeatable if you can see it
multiple times in your experimenting
then that is something to take into
consideration if it's not repeatable if
it just shows up one time you consider
an outlier
there are several variables that could
have been at play that we can't control
and that's why they won't be included in
our data shadow the Tomb Raider however
is an exception check out thread
utilization in the scene I do expect a
few newer Triple A titles will follow
suit in the coming months and years but
again this isn't the norm and you
shouldn't
expect it to be for several years
despite whatever consoles are doing I've
heard a few people say well consoles are
standardized because the PC industry is
totally different right consoles are
standardized everyone has the same unit
they're all the same Xbox they're all
the same ps5 whatever right we're
talking about specific generations here
but on PC it's a different ballgame
right everyone has a different system
for the most part it's a you know
someone could have a Pentium another
person could have a core i7 someone else
could have a core I know and someone
else could have a thread Ripper how do
you account for all of that most systems
running with half as many cores as what
comes in this will fare just as well in
most titles and that's what devs want
they don't want to leave a bulk of their
audience the fact that the vast majority
of their audience behind because the
fact is most people are using lower core
count chips still and if you optimize
for higher core counts and you're going
to penalize those who have lower core
count chips that's one viewpoint that I
want you to consider going forward
because you shouldn't be surprised at
the 1,300 X isn't that much better than
the 3700 made let's be real who games
exclusively with a 12-course see huge
doesn't make sense but ok enough
rambling sieving ahead a bit we have
Witcher 3 performance between the 3900 X
and at 9900 K is nearly identical here
this is actually good news it was in the
small gap the 3700 X left behind but I
again wouldn't advise spending a little
under 200 bucks more for a few extra
frames f1 20-17 behaved in a similar
fashion at the 3900 x2 closes the gap
but the price isn't justified for a pure
gaming scenario it's the same for pub G
and universe and box 2 more chorus
sounds great on paper but the actual
practicality of them for gaming is just
not there for me like don't get me wrong
and there are 900 acts is an incredible
CPU at this price but for nearly $200
less you could cop a 3700 X and enjoy
95% of the frame rates and I have a
feeling Oh same thing about the 3600 so
stay tuned for that review when we get
our hands on a sample that's honestly
what this comes down to right most games
don't care whether you have 6 or 12
cores so it depends on your use case
really if you're streaming quite a bit
along with intensive gaming that I'd say
the 8 core is the sweet spot to be
completely honest with you sure the 6
core could handle it as well but I like
having a bit of breathing room for the
future I mean future proofing
is it overuse term but to be completely
honest if games are already saturating
to at least a decent extent six cores
and twelve threads I wouldn't be
surprised if in a few years eight cores
becomes the new six core that's for the
12 core though it's just it's a totally
different story I mean you're paying a
lot more right serious content creators
can consider this it's an option but
again it's going to depend on the
program in my case the 3700 X would be a
significantly better buy save the extra
money throw it into a better graphics
card maybe and you'll be happier I
honestly believe this I think you'll
benefit from a much beefier graphics
card at this point anything at 8 cores
or above right so my recommendation is
for the 3700 ax at this point a vast
majority of you could benefit from a
better graphics card past eight cores
again if you're compiling or running VMs
and consider the 12 core instead it
should be that simple but I still have a
feeling a few of you are gonna buy the
12 core just say that you have a 12 core
because you think it's future proof for
because it sounds cool and look I've got
news for you the 8 core is already
future proof but anyway with that I'll
leave you to decide what's best for your
money
for your wallet and yeah based on what
you've seen in this video and others I'm
sure you'll make at least a somewhat
informed decision do not buy a 12 core
