how to gain YouTube sponsors video i
figured i would follow that up with
something else that kind of falls in the
same category but that i think should be
emphasized first and foremost and that's
actually having a youtube channel that
people know and talk about and are
willing to go back to for product
reviews or you know so it depends on
what you're doing now this video is not
only going to pertain to tech youtubers
but i'm gonna emphasize that one because
it's probably one of the hardest markets
to penetrate at this point because it is
so saturated with people out there
wanting to do the same things now i
can't say from experience that when i
first started science to do i wasn't
doing computer stuff and after realizing
that computers were the hot things on
youtube i switched to that for the sake
of gaining a fanbase and i ended up
actually really loving it so that's kind
of why I stuck with it no company is
going to want to send you a product if
you have 10 subscribers that's just a
fact they're not going to waste their
time with the channel that they know is
not going to receive a lot of views it's
basically an advertisement on their part
they're essentially paying for the
advertisement by giving you the product
for free and if you don't have a large
enough fanbase they're not going to
waste their time that's just how big
companies work it's even how small
companies work you won't even have
Chinese companies reaching out to you
that you know manufacturer basically
knockoffs of name-brand products because
they don't even want to waste their time
with you now that's not I'm not trying
to be harsh but that is the reality of
the techs fear really any kind of
company that's looking to advertise
products and youtube channels aren't
going to go for the ones that don't have
views it's just common sense but even if
you're not into product reviews let's
just say you're an artist who likes to
upload time lapse drawings and paintings
or a car enthusiast who likes to get his
or her hands on some really fast cars
for the sake of review and the
occasional Youtube upload how do you get
your youtube name your personal brand
that you've created out there to the
masses how to get people talking about
your channel on forums in the comments
you know just just ready to come back to
your channel immediately after you
upload a new video there are more ways
than one to approach this subject but i
will speak from personal experience can
i give you some pointers here and there
that will help you grow your YouTube
channel
the first thing I want to talk about is
investment it is a touchy subject for
real I mean people don't like spending
money on things that they're uncertain
about they don't know if their YouTube
channels going to take off so should
they even worry about investing in
equipment if they're not going to make
money in the long run or be able to rely
on into some source of income and my
answer to those people who are worried
about that and kind of on the fence
about it is do it if you're all in on
this and you're you really want to make
your YouTube channel just take off
invest in a decent camera and a decent
microphone I can take from experience
the first two things I notice when I
watch any video is one how good the
camera quality is or the camera recorder
you know if you've got a really nice
camera but you're shaking it all over
the place or something that's going to
ruin the experience as well but cameras
number one and then the audio quality is
number two so if you're doing a lot of
talking maybe you're doing an
instructional or something and you're
speaking in the background if your voice
sounds like garbage or your picture
looks like garbage then it's going to
turn people off I'm not saying that to
be harsh I'm just saying that to help
you out that's how people are they're so
used to these super expensive cameras
being used to film these videos that
they watch on a daily basis that when
they have to revert to something that
isn't even close to on par with what
they're used to they're going to
associate that with somebody who just
doesn't care about the youtube channel
or just you know is inexperienced
overall now that could just be because
you can't afford a camera at this point
maybe you're just starting out kind of
trying to test the waters and you're
realizing that people really don't care
about your YouTube channel so you're
like well I'm glad I didn't invest in an
expensive camera for this stuff because
people just don't care anyway I say we
think that because it could just be that
they don't care because it looks like
you don't care that may not be the truth
I mean you could have some of the best
instructionals in the world some of the
best vlogs reviews in the world but if
you're filming it on a cheap camera
phone without optical image
stabilization people just aren't going
to care to watch it economically you
could have the best content in the world
that's what they're going to have to
deal with is the actual video and if the
video looks like crap they're going to
associate that with just a crappy
youtube channel now there are channels
that get away with this a prime example
is grade-a under it
you've heard of him if you haven't you
can check out his link to his channel in
this video's description but literally
all of his videos for the most part are
made with Microsoft Paint I'm pretty
sure that's what he's still using so at
first glance you're like well this guy
really doesn't care about his content I
mean he's using Microsoft Paint and his
videos aren't even in the full 16 by 9
resolution but if you actually you know
listen to what he talks about in his
videos he has a very unique perspective
a very creative personality and just
brings dry subjects to life and that's
what said his sets his channel part so
it's going to depend on the content the
stuff you're trying to deliver to your
audience you have to ask yourself up
front if you'll be using a for majority
of your channel's life a camera or some
kind of other software in his case
microsoft paint it very few people can
get away with that he gets away with it
beautifully but I don't recommend using
that in most cases it's just it's just
going to turn people off unless you have
a super super out their personality that
can bring things back to life so camera
the first thing that I would recommend
by something like a nikon d 3333 hundred
you're going to look at anywhere from
400 to 800 dollars for a decent DSLR
grade category you see where I'm going
with this so in that price range
anywhere from 400 8r bucks I recommend
at least 1080p 60fps your viewers will
appreciate that now the microphone is
another issue i purchased i'll show you
what i have where is it it's right over
there so this right here is a microphone
that I use when I'm out of the studio or
when I just don't feel like using the
Yeti microphone this requires a lot of
post-processing and editing and this I
just plug into my iPhone and I'm good to
go I have to have the converter on it
because i have an iphone 7 but apart
from that it'll work its trrs you can
plug it into any modern smartphone and
boom you've got a decent sounding lapel
microphone that you can use and
interviews things of that sort let's say
got a camera man you're just walking
around you don't want to use the cameras
microphone you can use something like
this and your viewers will also
appreciate this the fact that you were
even willing to spend this wasn't like
20 bucks I have it linked in the
description but this will really change
the audio quality of your channel so if
you're someone who does a lot of vlogs
or things of that sort and you don't
have I don't know a
three-thousand-dollar camera with a
really nice rode microphone on top or
something like that then invest in
something like this at least in the
beginning you
will appreciate it it does really it
does make a difference take my word for
it when I finally got the Yeti
microphone that was a big deal as well
my audio game was just on a completely
different level and the viewership
feedback was definitely positive from
that so those are the two things I
suggest investing in upfront a nice
camera and a nice microphone third thing
I would recommend is a nice computer now
it doesn't have to be a
two-thousand-dollar beast or anything
like that it can actually just be a
laptop if you're willing to spend around
a thousand dollars on a decent laptop
with maybe an i7 6700 HQ or just any
kind of typical desktop with an i3 or an
i5 you can get away with some pretty
heavy video editing on those things if
you have a bit of patience from premier
to Vegas to da Vinci resolve any of
those programs i recommend they'll they
won't compress the hell out of your
video so it's going to still look decent
at least until you upload it to youtube
that's something you can really can't
control but stay away from software like
movie maker if you can especially if
you're using a 1080p 60fps camera you're
not gonna be able to export in 1080p
60fps at least with the generation of
movie maker that I am used to using
that's actually what I use in the
beginning of my channel and then when I
move to Premier I was just able to do so
much more with it so unless you're doing
some kind of vlog where you don't think
60 FPS is going to make much of a
difference maybe you're just cameras
just sitting still a lot and you're just
doing tricks on a skateboard or
something and the differ between 30 and
60 might not be a big deal there but if
you're moving the camera a lot and you
don't have maybe optical image
stabilization then you're going to want
something other than movie maker it's
just going to make the the entire
viewing experience a bit better and a
bit more enjoyable for your audience the
fourth thing I recommend is testing the
waters not just in your comfort zone but
a little outside of that so when I first
started making science videos that's why
this channel is called science studio I
had no interest in computers i wasn't i
didn't even know how to build a computer
and then when i realized that people
really weren't into the stuff i was
showing i mean i was a really small
channel anyway no but nobody knew who i
was i started i started debating whether
i should build a computer to make my
videos look better so i did the third
thing i did step 3 I I built a nice
computer in in
an attempt to make my videos look more
professional to reach out to a bigger
audience but because it was science to
do I said well I'll just fill my
computer building process it's my first
computer ever so it'll be interesting
for people to see anyway the channel
actually started blowing up people
really wanted to see it I don't I don't
know why I was a budget PC bill that's
like 500 bucks but people really into it
and I received thousands upon thousands
of views and that's not to say that
anybody who's into anything on YouTube
should build a computer and upload it
and that's how you'll get views you know
you don't have to be into computers in
order to produce a good YouTube channel
or to get people to recognize you but
that was one way that I was able to kind
of find a target audience that I didn't
originally intend on reaching but that
really helped grow the channel and
ultimately ended up evolving the channel
into a primarily tech related science so
that's where i am now that was a result
of listening to audience feedback and
just doing what people wanted to see so
let's say you're an artist let's say you
draw pictures for your youtube channel
if you're trying to show people in a lot
of these videos how to draw specific
things like how to draw a human face but
surely cannot do or how to draw a wolf
or maybe a landscape if people aren't
interested in the how-to videos maybe
you should change every now and then the
subject of the videos to something along
the lines of you know the Mona Lisa
you're just like copying other people's
work but you're trying to improve upon
it or something you know something
different like that or just a big time
lapse of a ultra panoramic picture you
took with your iPhone I don't know I'm
just throwing things out there but you
see I'm saying so don't stick with
something that really isn't being
received by your audience it's not
something you can control your content
could be super good but if people just
aren't finding it in their search
engines on you know Google Yahoo or even
YouTube itself I don't recommend staying
just their soyuz other videos that
appear to be more I don't know more
viral for your viewers to get people to
come back to your channel to watch the
stuff that wasn't originally found in
the first place that's a good way to
kind of hook your viewers and then kind
of slowly but surely reel them in to the
content that you originally started the
channel with now in my case I haven't
really done
I've stuck with pc stuff because I'm
still growing at a rate that I find very
satisfactory it's a reason for me not to
change back to the old stuff and I have
a feeling a lot of my viewers would
would not appreciate the fact that I was
just abandoning computers all together
or maybe not showcasing it as much as I
am so you have to kind of feel your
audience out in the long run are they
willing to accept the changes that you
want to make or is your channel growing
plenty fine as it is and you're okay
with staying with the content that
you're at so if you originally plan on
showing how to is but the videos that
are really pulling people to your
channel are the time lapses or the
attempts at making old paintings look
even better than they were if those are
the the hotter videos on your channel
stick with those don't don't pull those
out of sight because those are the ones
that are gonna keep your channel viral
that'll keep people talking about them
in forms and things of that sort those
are the things that that really can
bring a channel to life is when people
talk about them outside of YouTube so
they'll post one of your videos on a
forum for example you'll know it
happened because the next day you'll
wake up and you'll have you know tons
more views way more than you're used to
just from one day chances are somebody
share that video somewhere else and a
lot of people saw it thanks to the
traffic on that form or other site those
kinds of videos are the ones you want to
stick with or at least come back to on a
weekly basis or something along those
lines if you're if you just aren't as
into those videos but those are still
the ones that are keeping people coming
maybe you should rethink your priorities
with the channel or you know move on to
something else because if you don't like
what you're doing it's tough because if
you want to make a living out of YouTube
in some cases you're gonna have to do
things that you find boring that you
just don't think are that cool but that
your audience really appreciates and
really likes to share with their friends
things that ultimately bring you a lot
of attention and can make you a lot of
money so if YouTube something you want
to make a full time job out of in the
future you're gonna have to compromise
and some things that you think are super
cool that other people just don't think
of that awesome take my channel for
example when I talk about space space
was like the space was the thing I
started the channel with I love
astronomy I love physics those kinds of
things really interest me honestly
probably as much if not more than
computers even to this day but a lot of
my viewers don't care to watch those
videos that's just how it is they follow
me they subscribe to the channel for the
sake of watching computer builds
computer test things of that sort and I
know that in the back of my mind I know
that's what they want to see so when I
upload a video that has nothing to do
with computers I know that a lot of
people are going to just ignore the
video outright not want to walk it
because it doesn't fall into their
category of interest that's what you
have to ask yourself do you want to make
youtube a full-time job or not or even a
part time job that brings them some
decent income every month let's say you
upload videos on Saturdays and Sundays
because you work nine to five monday
through friday if YouTube is a decent
source of income let's say use it to go
on vacations every month or something
you have to give your audience what they
want not what you want otherwise they
will ignore your videos they're they're
brutal when it comes to this but they're
there at least they're honest with
themselves and with you they don't want
to see it they're not gonna want to
watch it you're not going to make money
from it it's gonna be a big waste of
time other than making yourself feel I
know I guess making yourself feel good
that you uploaded a video that
interested you money talks and it's
ultimately what's going to drive
channels that want to be successful
that's exactly what science to do is
doing I didn't start off with computers
but that's what I do for the most part
now because most of my subscribers
subscribe for pc and tech related
content that's what I give them it's
what makes me money frankly and it's
what keeps the lights on it's what keeps
me motivated to upload more and more
videos like this I want to do this full
time I really do I don't want to
graduate and go work for somebody else
who has me work from nine to five every
monday through friday i come home and
then just repeat the same thing over and
over again with this i get to do i get
to be creative i get to do in a sense
what i want but at the same time
following suit with what you expect and
i think that there's a really good blend
there and if channels get that right
they can really take off so take that to
heart really think about your audience
in every video how many people are going
to want to watch this video how many
people are going to share this video
this video interesting is it no it
doesn't have to be all about the content
creator it honestly should be more about
the audience keep them first and their
interests first primarily and your
channel will succeed I guarantee it so
get those six things in line I don't
remember what else exam or the camera
the microphone have a decent editing rig
ask yourself you know what you want to
talk about be willing to be flexible
with the content that you provide and
ask yourself if you want to make you to
the full time job or not because if you
do then you're you're gonna have to
really listen to your audience read read
as many comments as you can those are
the things that I recommend you do it's
why science to do is where it is that's
why we're growing at the rate we're
growing that's why I keep sticking with
the topics that people want to see it's
why I put so much effort into these
videos if you like this video appreciate
the content be sure to give the thumbs
up give it a thumbs down if you feel the
complete opposite or maybe you disagree
with everything I just said I don't know
why but if you do let me know in the
comments subscribe if you haven't ready
to stay tuned for more PC related stuff
we're gonna do some more upgrades to
Walter White be quiet the brand be quite
is coming to the rescue with their new
power supply should fix the issue that
we have with it currently if you're just
about why that happened or what was
going on check out the video right here
this is science to do thanks for
learning with this</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
