will be very awkward I'm using the blue
Yeti I'm in the film room today because
Lisa's setting up for her live stream
which boo will will commence after this
one and that one's more of a relaxed
relaxed kickback time so if you guys
want to hang out with this place in pub
G or something then that is what we will
be doing after this will end in probably
an hour or so it really depends on how
long we stick to the questions and
whatnot if you guys have tons of
questions obviously I'll be here longer
and I don't mind that because a lot of
your questions honestly they're good
questions and if I don't know the answer
I say this every live stream I tried to
anyway I don't know the answer then I
will do my best to research a topic and
either address it in a video or I will
tweet at you or something we'll find a
way to communicate but anyway I got the
live chat up right now and I am just all
these folks or eyes how would you say
that I guess I'm all eyes yeah that's it
also how's the house the audio I'm just
streaming from the blue Yeti today
no XLR interface or anything so let me
know if I need to turn myself up or down
it looks like my volume is right in the
comfort zone there in the yellow but if
it gets too loud or you hear thuds on
the desk or whatever just let me know
and I will do my best to address it
that's good sounds good so far awesome I
see a few of our channel members I see
Dan
I see our moderators tech crimson I know
I saw someone else here earlier trucker
bombs here I see all you guys I'm good
to see you guys again and again this is
a Sunday night thing so or Monday
morning slash Monday afternoon think
depending on or you live time zones are
freaking weird anyway okay so let's get
to the questions folks if you got some
cues fire mount and I'll try my best to
dish out them A's but I'm not sure if
you guys have some really technical
questions and sometimes it just catches
me off guard you know I don't I don't
claim to know everything obviously
there's a lot of stuff that I have to
research heavily before I feel
comfortable here I'm making a video
about
some of these topics so off-the-cuff you
know if I don't know something I will
tell you and I'll do my best to address
it at a future date so what's got
victress 22 y'all yellow batteries are
looking good also everyone who lives on
the East Coast right now pay special
attention to the Weather Channel your
news stations because if you are a East
Coast United States citizen then you're
probably watching the Hurricanes that
are gonna be barreling down the Atlantic
so stay tuned and be safe please because
those will hit more than likely before
next Sunday night's livestream all right
to the questions here let's see this
one's cool Trevor Trevor with a three
random question for a tech youtuber but
what was your first car totally
understand it I'm a car guy my first car
was a Mazda 6 I had I was 16 and I had I
didn't have I didn't really need a car
we we took the bus all the time to
school my parents rarely dropped us off
just because why not I mean the bus is
free my parents don't have to you know
worry about taking us so early in the
morning especially for high school high
school started so much earlier than
middle school did for me I think middle
school started alais 8:30 and then high
school started like 7:10 so I mean
sometimes the Sun wasn't even up by the
time school started for us and that was
a little weird
but I took the bus until I was 16 and
then my dad decided to buy me my first
car so we went to Tampa Florida
we bought a Mazda 6 so it was a v6 Mazda
and it was a pretty cool little
hatchback hatchback sedan whatever gonna
call it but it did have the hatchback
trunk and it was a peppy little car it's
still actually my parents still have
that car I think my little sister drives
it now but it was a good car not too
many problems I got into a wreck with it
when I was 18 or 19 right before I went
to college but once it was fixed up cars
been running pretty strong since I mean
it's you know it's a Japanese car
they're known for their long-term
durability I just realized that this
chat wasn't scroll
there we go okay Ramsey tomorrow when
will 2228 ET i benchmarks come out
September 20th I think it's a day it
might be give or take a few days but I
know it's like September 20th ish and
that will be the day that you will see
all the tech tubers excuse me throw up
benchmarks Tech Crimson asked what did
you figure out was a problem with what
Lisa's PC I think I don't know why she's
complaining of stuttering and I know
that it's not her system not handling
the stream properly because she's got a
2,700 X in there and at you know gtx
1070 like there's no reason for any
stuttering at all i think that and we
checked the OBS settings and all of that
i'm pretty sure we've narrowed it down
to the graphics card I think it's the
riser cable which would be like the
obvious you know that was something that
I probably should have thought of right
away but she has a riser cable in there
to turn that card sideways and I think
that thing might be going bad and that's
why under intense loads she notices that
it stutters every now and then and and
riser cables are super touchy super
sensitive so many little different
connections there on that PCIe bridge
you have to you know keep streamline and
without touching each other crossing
over and when you you know bend and flex
that riser cable you can have contact
between pins and disruptions and data
flow and all that good stuff so that's
why you might see stuttering that's
something I've experienced with other
riser cables sometimes riser cables
don't even work you know you don't get
signal from your graphics card so it all
depends let's see Co fossa science
studio what's the formula to calculate
what PS you wanted you need I watched
your video but I feel like it's
overestimating too much but okay so it's
it's supposed to overestimate too much
that's the point so I think my safety
factor was 1.5 so I would take all TDP
sums and remember TDP and power draw are
not the same thing but you can use TDP
to kind of gauge power draw let's say I
know for like the 67 or I think it's a
67 okay and one of them is like 91 watt
TDP but of course when you overclock
that you're gonna be consuming far more
power than 91 watts and the TDP will
also go up as a result of that
so the and I'm pretty sure the TDP
rating has to do with the base frequency
and the boost frequency I'm it doesn't
account at all for overclock so when you
overclock you're gonna be consuming a
lot more power obviously more heat is
dissipated from the CPU you'll need a
bigger cooler than a 91 watt cooler to
keep things in check otherwise you're
gonna thermal throttle that's what TDP
seeks to do is kind of gauge how much
heat you'll have to dispense to the air
via some cooler but what I do is I take
all the TDP sums and then I multiply by
a safety factor of 1.5 and so for
example if you have you know horizon 7
2700 and a gtx 1070 like lisa does
pretty sure that gtx 1070 s and the 200
watt let's just say it's 200 watt TDP i
don't remember off the top of my head so
200 watts there and then let's say a
hundred and I'm pretty sure it's a lot
lower than 100 let's just say a hundred
watts for the 2700 now of course you got
smaller things to consider you've got
you know you gotta power your pump LEDs
whatever Ram all of those things are
gonna consume tiny bits of power but the
two major components obviously your the
GPU and CPU so with those two combined
that's 300 watts and then I multiplied
by a safety factor of 1.5 and that gives
you what 450 watts so you could get by
with a 450 watt power supply with a gtx
1070 and an r5 or excuse me r7 2700 now
I've done something very similar to that
before people over estimate the heck out
of PS use out of the wattages but it
doesn't hurt to as long as you're not
buying like a 1500 watt power supply for
a 400 watt load like and at that point
you're actually straining your power
supply on the other side of the spectrum
is difficult for power supplies to
output small amounts of power relative
to their total you know power rating
it's also difficult for them to maintain
high power loads with respect to their
power rating so you want to stay in the
sweet spot that's why the efficiency
curve exists and yeah there you go okay
let's move on to another question let's
try to fire some quick ones off here if
I can see sound FX onine do you plan on
revisiting older graphics cards that you
have price of a GPS are incredible news
market right now and yes actually
I just bought a 980ti for like 260 bucks
now I know you can get it for cheaper
than that but I spent 260 because this
was the zotac amp Extreme Edition so it
overclocks a lot and it's got the two
8-pin supplemental power connectors and
whatnot so I paid a little more for just
the power overhead but like I was so
surprised by how cheap they were even 10
70's or 250 bucks right now yeah that's
your time to jump on I I wouldn't blame
you at all for buying a used graphics
card right now in that range for 250
bucks because let's say it turns out
let's say you know r-tx ends up being
everything we hoped it could be more
right 50 plus percent performance
increases and let's say that the the
third-party you know the the Adhan board
manufacturers start selling these cards
for you know let's say an RT X 27 t
sells for 450 bucks which that's not
gonna happen out of the gate but let's
just assume for all intents and purposes
it does you're still not going to be
upset spending 250 bucks on a 1070
because the 1070 is still gonna have you
know a similar FPS per dollar ratio
you're still going to be spending you
know an equivalent amount of money for
the same amount of performance
relatively speaking so if you spent 450
instead of 250 you wouldn't be throwing
away money essentially um you can always
resell that card later on anyway and it
probably won't drop in value much more
than they already have
so it's a long game for sure but I think
right now is a great time to buy cards
so if you're in the market for something
other than what you have like let's say
you're on like a r7 370 or an r9 290
like in my opinion right now if you're
on one of those cards ditch those and
buy something that's at least one gen
old well that is one job wouldn't go two
or three gen gens back at this point I
would say maxwell's good pascal's good
and then you could go for like an RX 480
or 580 because most of those are gonna
be new though but if you can find some
used ones for sub $200 then you're also
sitting pretty so yeah it all really
depends on what you're interested in
spending and for the most part you're
gonna find better value in they used
graphics card market right now and just
because that influx again of cards that
people bought for mining and other
purposes
has finally taken hold and this is what
we talked about for a long time so it's
it's really great to see and I'm
impressed that that prices are so much
lower than then they were six months ago
they really really adjusted normal
viewer $1.99 super chat thank you Mon
dude which is better gtx 1050 or RX 560
I honestly I'd have to go I had I would
go back and check there are plenty of
benchmarks online I hate to just throw
that at you I have experience with the
GT or with the GTX 1050 but not the rx
560 I know they're very similar and I'm
sure in some titles they will trade
blows I will say this I even though
Nvidia changed and I say that's quite a
bit
Nvidia change the GeForce experience UI
they make you log in now which i think
is stupid it's just gonna gather you
know user data I I preferred GeForce
experience for shadow play because I use
shadow play for a tonne of stuff so if
you're used to using shadow play and
then you want to you know you're
considering migrating to AMD and let's
say you have the choice between an
equivalent you know let's say a 10 60
versus a 580 and they're both similarly
priced and you you know expect that
they're gonna perform on par with each
other as well in most cases then I would
choose the 1060 personally because I
prefer shadow play and that's only
because that was something I was used to
earlier in my PC gaming career I was
just more use of shadow play and having
to adjust to the AMD whatever they got
going on now it's just it's a big change
personally and that's that's just that's
just me but I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
try to hide the fact that I prefer
shadow play I don't think that makes me
a fanboy for preferring one UI over the
other and that's certainly not gonna
stop me from calling out garbage when I
see it on either the green or red team
but I'm just more familiar with those
drivers and then that UI so that's why I
choose it
Jonathan Mercado think of that $5.00 to
perch at my dude I love your music
choices and videos I appreciate that
notice you son drivers or Ryan and
several of them are you a big
progressive house fan or is it
coincidence you know in my downtime I
listen to a lot of rock hard
you know occasionally and the like pop
stuff but most of its it's pretty like
classic rock or hard rock vibe but a
progressive house okay so I died I
intentionally went for progressive house
sounds you know that those tones that
kind of feeling right because I feel
like it gives it gives the videos a
sense of kind of like peppy 'no sand
excitement in a situation where you
might not be super excited to want to
learn about tenser course or you know
ray-tracing or just a random insert
science topic here you know so when we
do this explanation videos like in the
crash course series and in the minute
science videos i try to keep it kind of
lively on the on the music side of
things because i feel like at times it
can get very boring listening to just me
talk about stuff and I feel like the
music plays a big part in that for a lot
of people so if I played some like
really mellow chill music like you
probably would get super bored and leave
and click away but if I you know keep
the music kind of fast-paced and and
interesting but not like overkill where
you're just listening to the music then
it's it's more enticing and it keeps you
interested I don't know it's probably
some subliminal thing I'm sure people
have done research on and and all that
jazz but I like the music I like the way
it sounds and I think it fits the
profile so yeah it's it's not really a
coincidence it's it's intentional but
I'm not sure if it's intentional for the
right reasons or not it's just kind of
me experimenting with what sounds good
under what situation okay here let's see
XANA mr is 2600 better than 2600 x value
for the money i in most cases it's a
better value yeah I would recommend the
2600 over the 2600 X unless they were
the same price
maybe I mean in the situation in which
there may be ten dollars apart you could
say 2600 X because you might get that
extra 100 or 200 megahertz out of an
overclock but in in my testing they both
overclocked almost identically anyway so
the 2600 would still be the better
option there despite only a $10 Delta so
yeah I would say 2600 is good enough
you're not gonna buy that and go no I
wish I had bought the 2600 X like
there's just not gonna happen you might
feel that way with r5
respect to r7 but between our five CPUs
at least in the the 2,600 2,600 acts
you're not going to notice a difference
and so yeah I would say it's the better
value just because they're usually
priced about 20 bucks apart or more
let's see scrolling down here okay Nick
h-hey science studio I have some thermal
paste from my CPU is it a good idea to
put it on my GPU yeah I don't know how
you
oh you mean you got a thermal compound
from it's just something you apply third
party I'm not sure if you're like
talking about scraping it off the cooler
or not you can I'm as far as I'm aware
you can reuse thermal paste I've done it
more than once the reason why you don't
want to keep like removing a cooler from
CPU and then reapplying it over and over
and over is because you get air bubbles
and stuff trapped between the cooler and
the IHS and that can be an area of
inefficiency where heat builds up and I
can you know heat your components up
higher than they would otherwise so
that's why I don't want to do that but
if you just want to like scrape the
thermal compound off and then reapply it
as long as it's not chipping and like
super crusty as long as it's liquidy and
and kind of not super viscous but enough
to where you can kind of play with it
I'd say it's still okay I I will run
tests on that I'm sure there's a fall
ready but I'm fairly certain that it's
reusable to an extent so yeah and you
can use the same thermal compound on
CPUs and GPUs just be careful if it's
conductive then you want to be sure that
you're not having that stuff run over on
to other components on the board whether
it be or CPU or your GPU okay let's see
here lemonade says answer this I have an
FX 80 120 and a gtx 1050 TI should I
upgrade to i-5 2400 or upgrade the
cooler it depends I don't know your
temperatures if you're running really
hot and the cooler would be a sweet
upgrade honestly your plaque your
platform is gonna be upgrade soon I
don't think it makes sense to upgrade to
an i-5 2400 because while you might have
success with certain titles they're
essentially side grades to an extent the
IPC jump between the i-5 2400 and the
i-5 8600 let's
or 8400 scuse me is gonna be about 25 to
30 percent so and you're gonna
experience a similar jump as well from
FX maybe a little more than that FX has
not been doing well lately so I wouldn't
upgrade to the 2,400 I would consider a
newer i-5 if you want to go with the
Nutella path otherwise just buy a better
cooler than the one you have okay here
let's see Andy Lucero says making my
first PC bill thoughts on going with NHD
15 over liquid coolers look I've grown
to love air coolers and appreciate them
more than I used to I usually think it
was so cool to have liquid cooling I
could say my system was liquid cooled
you know but at the end of the day
they're really not much better than
their air-cooled counterparts especially
for the price so it's more of an
aesthetic thing I think in most cases
because if you're gonna spend a hundred
bucks on an a i/o versus a hundred bucks
on an air cooler you're likely and I get
a higher TDP or you know the you're
gonna get more thermal Headroom I should
say with the beefy air cooler versus an
AIO
so like deep cool captain 240 X is a TDP
of like 150 ish watts which is okay but
it's not super good versus if you spent
a hundred bucks on a be quiet dark rock
Pro for right it's just huge you know
air cooler from be quiet that thing's
got a 250 watt TDP which means in theory
you could overclock higher you could you
know you'd be able to handle more heat
output from a CPU with the air cooler
versus the a i/o for the same price so a
lot of times air coolers are actually
better value for money and you get
better performance by spending less
money usually which is what value means
basically and then if you are worried
about silence you know like people buy a
iOS because they're quiet but big you
know beefy air coolers are just as quiet
if not quieter than liquid coolers
because you don't hear the pump you know
you don't really hear the pump most of
the time anyway with AI O's but there's
a off chance that you do and a lot of
time pushing air through rad fins can be
a louder process than pushing them
through fins on a you know heatsink from
a from a CPU cooler just because of the
way in which Brad's work you know
thinner channels thinner
spaces for air to move through the rads
they can usually be louder and that's
another reason I think going with air
cooling is a good option of course there
are pros as well for liquid coolers but
that's my argument for air so whether
you agree or not that's my experience
and I would say an HD 15 is a great
option for whatever CP you're gonna
throw into it Jerry Jenkins thank you
for that
super chat my dude a dollar 46
interesting interesting number but I
appreciate in the less and thank you for
watching Jerry I'm gonna scroll down
here let's see I drop iPhone that's his
name interesting what's a good full
tower case because I mean looking to
water cool eventually I don't really I
don't dive much into full towers I would
say that the one that I'm most familiar
with it I appreciate is the dark the
dark based pro 900 the rep to model
which has the basement and the is it
have a tempered glass swing outdoor I
don't never heard of the swing outdoor
or not but the ref to version that I
remember at Computex looked really nice
and pretty sure it's if it hasn't
already been reviewed and pretty sure
you can buy it now I'll off the check
honestly I've been so focused on the on
the 601 that we just did a review on
that I haven't even looked at the 9 900
rf2 but that one's a really good one if
you're interested I like the dark face
Pro 900 and the rev to model but the
basement makes it look so much more
clean in my opinion so maybe you look
into that one and that's that's assuming
that you're regarding a full tower
something that has eight PCIe slots you
can build custom loops and mid towers
all day long I've done that so many
times so I mean de facto designed to
fine r6 for example or the fantex evolve
X or NZXT cases or fantex cases like
other fan tech stations you know there's
tons of options and they don't have to
be full towers and support liquid
cooling paradox games and entertainment
for non super chat my dude I appreciate
that
will my 1600 X a 3.9 farewell with a
1080 for the win I want to upgrade my
1070 for the one but I'm not sure if I
should upgrade my chip first its 1600 X
is
to be perfectly fine I would say under
most scenarios with a 1080 even a 1080
Ti I mean if you really wanted to go up
to a 1080i you would still see gains
your CPU might be limiting you under
certain scenarios but if you plan on
bumping in game settings like let's say
you want to run in very high or ultra
presets versus medium to high presets in
you know 1440p with a 1070 now then
you'll be able to do that with 1080 and
probably maintain the same frame rate
and that's the jump that's what you pay
for right you pay more for the 1080 to
have those better in-game graphics or at
a game at a higher resolution so either
way you choose to approach that the 10
the excuse me the 1600 X is going to be
just fine I would be perfectly
comfortable pairing that up if you
wanted in the future to upgrade you
could always swap the 1600 X for a 2600
run XMP on your you know ddr4 and with
those higher clocks thanks to the
Infinity fabric either tie to the memory
frequency you'll be able get any man
higher FPS there so yeah that's just an
upgrade path you could consider because
that wouldn't require a motherboard swap
but if you wanted that would be an
upgrade path if you wanted you can do
that or you can do like an r7 2700 it
would also be a pretty sweet bump as
well okay let's see scrolling down I see
the good questions
scrolling down try nitrogen cooling from
smiley PC tech yeah I've seen enough
people do that that I'm not going to I'm
not gonna touch that with a 10-foot Pole
frankly it's just an enthusiast thing
that makes no sense in the real world I
totally get it if you want to be cool
and like say that you did this really
cool thing and overclocked but in all
reality like that stuff requires so much
maintenance hands-on you can't you know
just let nitrogen pump through your
system and just play video games you
have to maintain you have to watch it
and you have to keep adding it and so
it's it's more or less just you know I
don't know it's just a little fun
experiment people do like I don't know
like you buy a fast car to drag race but
you can't actually drive it on the
street you know so it's just a temporary
thing that you do to have fun
in my opinion it's not really worth the
time and hassle maybe to get on the top
10 of some board that would be cool but
I still don't think it's worth it then
to other people sure but to each his own
let's see Xander kin 903 well third
party 20 series GPUs have NB link I
think that's already been decided but I
have to go back and double-check I'm
pretty sure we've already concluded that
so we'll have to double check but SLI I
mean the idea of moving to MVA link now
is that SLI bandwidth possibilities
right the the bandwidth support with SLI
is limited with new cards being that
they're you know they can handle so much
more now that using SLI would
essentially bottleneck the two cards
communicating with each other
so get a need for NV link and that's why
it was introduced this time around into
more mainstream cards let's see the
random comment or says as to do you plan
on buying an RT X GPU for your main rig
or wait for Navi I don't I think you you
should watch my r TX videos and that
will answer your question for you I have
three videos on the subject so that's
that's why they're out there you should
watch those that answers your question I
think let's see mr. me stupid question
there are no stupid questions here I'm
making a black / white build is it worth
the ugly knock schewe any good similar
coolers be quiet I mean I totally get it
like knock you'e coolers and fans are
great but they're just ugly
nokju it does make you can get there
trying to remember crow max the crow max
fans I actually use them in a recent
build for Lisa you can get Chrome X fans
those are black and you can replace the
little rubber mounts on each corner -
you know with white or whatever to match
your color scheme a actually swap those
out so if you want to stick with nacho
you can do that with their chrome axe
fans or you can go with be quiet they
have dark coolers almost black coolers
those look really good in white and
black build or you could go with cryo
rig they have some really nice like the
quad Lumi that's when I use my personal
rig that cooler looks really sweet and
really any system
but yeah black and white off the top of
my head I know that the be quiet coolers
are gonna look really good in there and
then if you wanted to go with knock
schewe you would have to buy some chrome
axe fans and stick those into the end of
the coolers but that's probably more
work than you're interested in and in
doing and I don't blame you all right
let's see here
scrolling down Michael Caballero
not sure if you've answered this already
just popped in but how long do you think
that the cards and video dump to the AI
bees will last before the 10 series is
discontinued I'm not sure yet look I
think that we're gonna start to see I
mean this is gonna happen across the
board it's not just one AI be that that
it's having to deal with this I think
this is happening across the board
because Nvidia did overestimate the
demand during the mining craze so what
you're what you'll notice and I think I
don't remember I never looked for this
specifically when when Pascal rolled out
but can can you guys recall off the top
of your head like if you went to Amazon
or Newegg right now and you look for
let's say GTX 970 or GTX 980 as far as
I'm aware when Pascal rolled out those
those older cards the Maxwell series was
phased out fairly quick and I have a
feeling this time around that Pascal is
gonna stick around quite a bit longer
than Maxwell did for the Pascal launch
so what I expect you'll see because
these are TX cards are frankly very
expensive are you're gonna you're gonna
CRT X 20 70s and 20 80s and 20 ATT eyes
and eventually what the 20 60 or
whatever Nvidia rolls out with later on
they always do that they release the
weaker cards later because they're
cheaper margins are likely smaller so
they want to get most people who are
impatient to pay more money upfront
that's pure marketing but I'm pretty
sure you're gonna see those r-tx cards
mixed in with Pascal for quite a while
that that's just what I think is going
to happen because there is a surplus
right now and your that's what you're
seeing in the used market and the new
market I think the new markets gonna be
heard even more because people are
choosing to buy used versus new because
the use prices right now on sites like
eBay are so good like I said I just
bought a 90 DT I was at you know one of
the best
as you can buy from ZOTAC the amp
extreme model for 260 bucks you can get
them for as low as $200 even less than
that if you're really looking hard and
and 10 70s are selling for around 250
bucks so they're looking really good and
that's just another thing that you guys
probably want to consider you know if
you're in the market for a card then
that's just in my opinion a better
option at this point if you need one now
you don't want to spend 600 bucks use
market is exactly where you should be
looking all right let's see here Paul is
at science to do any new minute science
videos coming out soon I love the way
you break down and explain things the
video you made explaining
hyper-threading was amazing I've had a
few minutes science videos uploaded
recently you know I don't know how
YouTube's dishing out the this you know
subscription notifications all I crap
I'm sure we're getting shafted which has
been the case for several months now but
there are plenty of those videos still
in the mittens playlist that you may not
have seen yet we have one on I don't
know if it's a minute science at crash
course video but we have one on tensor
cores we have one on ray tracing we have
a couple more on I think refresh rate
and a few other topics but yeah we try
to simplify those for you guys and then
that's something that the medicines
playlist is popular for you guys like
the simplifications and let me tell ya
it requires a ton of research beforehand
this is not stuff that I claim to know
you know off the top of my head this
requires a lot of research on my part
because I don't know a lot about this
stuff until I actually start taking
notes and writing scripts regarding the
topics that I'm researching so it's just
like anything else you know anyone can
learn this the same way I do it's just
this happens to be my job so I actually
get to research things and present them
in videos to you guys and it's a fun job
it really is I'm gonna scroll over here
to the live tab because I missed a
couple super chat let me get to those ok
scrolling down I see yep there we go
okay so paradox games
Michael Caballero I just answered your
question and I'm coalition gaming
alright small channel review video ETA I
know I keep getting asked this it's my
fault
I'm gonna I got to commit to it just
do it I think it'd be really cool video
because you guys deserve to see some of
the smaller creators who haven't gotten
the exposure I think they deserve
because YouTube's algorithm favors the
big channels once big channels hit a
million subs they take off and the
reason why is because YouTube says well
you're already successful let's make you
more successful and I don't blame the
algorithm for doing that obviously if
you're getting more views per video
YouTube's making more money cuz they can
play more ads in those videos so it's a
win-win for both the creator and the
platform host in this case YouTube so
you know he's gotta break that barrier
and it it it's not like they're asking
for handouts these these people aren't
really you know contacting me saying hey
or you can have my channel in this
you're gonna have my channel and it's
more about just who I personally think
who I've seen deserves more recognition
now and if YouTube's not going to do it
then I'll do it and and hopefully other
people will do something similar because
you know I'm done the business of giving
out handouts but if I see somebody that
doesn't have the recognition I think
they deserve I'm gonna go out of my way
to point it out even if my traction in
this game is fairly small I'm not
worried about how many people end up
subscribing that's I don't have a goal
for that person that I'm trying to to
showcase in the video I just I just want
to to you know show them a little bit of
love because it's just I don't know a
lot of the tech tubers like oh we're not
competitors we're not you know we don't
compete with each other like that's all
a bunch of BS that at the end of the day
you know they're all looking at each
other looking at how many views they
have how many subscribers they have
we're all in the same industry we're all
in the same business and anybody who
tells you that they're not in the
business of of you know competing that
they're not here to whatever I mean at
the end of the day if it's their
full-time job they're gonna be worried
about it because if some channel comes
in and completely cuts out this other
person you know who was doing well for a
long time then they're gonna be you know
that's gonna hurt hard financially in
any business places like that you know
not just YouTube but I'm not worried if
I I mean it's it's something that it's
gonna be there no matter what you know I
just gonna keep doing you keep trying to
be unique do something different and if
you know if fate decides that you that
your channels gonna be successful at
will if YouTube
I guess I should say YouTube is the you
know the over washer right now but just
YouTube's kind of a pain sometimes this
video probably get to monetize because I
said that no there are a lot of good
questions I am seeing here Wow look at
this Wade cone science studio how much
of a performance loss is thermal
throttle have on gaming and how can I
prevent it from happening if I am aiming
for a higher with or without an AI oh
you can overclock pretty decent without
a iOS if you have beefy air coolers it
depends on your TDP you'll know if your
CPU is thermal throttling you need to
drop down your frequency and you'll know
when it there are thermal throttles if
you are not overclocked and it's thermal
throttling and you might want to check
me excuse me you might want to check the
thermal paste between the CPU and the in
the cooler because you might you might
be running on some super old stuff
that's just not transferring heat very
well if you're overclocking too much and
it's thermal throttling you need to drop
those clocks you do not want to deal
with an overclock that that throttles
when you're playing games and other
things cuz you're an experienced fps
rates that are going up and down all the
time and that's annoying nobody wants
that
alright let's see raelynne do you think
a razor product quality is garbage like
God I haven't tinkered with too many
razor products before I've played with
the razor blade stealth laptops they're
pretty nice the only thing that really
bothers me there is the the texture you
know like the fingerprint stick to those
dark surfaces really easily and I don't
like that that's one of the reasons why
I didn't get a blade stealth when I was
looking for a an ultrabook
and the only other razor product I've
had ever touched is Lisa's Kraken
headset and that's that's cool but I
still think there's a pretty decent
markup on that device so you know you
could get the same quality I think in a
product that costs twenty thirty bucks
less easily you're just paying for the
razor name which is somewhat what Apple
does and Ferrari and whoever else you
know anyone that has recognition that
that that people regard highly you know
socially economically they're gonna pay
a premium for it no matter what that's
just because they can because the demand
is there that's supply and demand that's
all simple econ 101 all right let's see
scroll and dad everyone
Craig what you guys say in the name I
see it I see a David Morris think of
that $10 super chat my dude how you
doing this Sunday night what do you
think what would you excuse me what
would you think if I said that Canon is
turning into the apple of cameras last
gen features at next-gen prices you know
honestly I haven't dabbled too much in
Canon the reason why is because they're
really expensive and that's that's just
something that I've always thought of
Canon I know that they're really good
for video and that's why a lot of tech
tubers and just youtubers in general use
Canon but in my opinion you know you
could get the same if not better quality
in a certain circumstances with a
Panasonic g85 like the one that sitting
right there I've used that thing for
over a year now and I guarantee you guys
can't tell sometimes when I'm using this
camera versus my $3,000 mirrorless sony
a7s - camera you know and this thing was
only like six seven hundred dollars so
it's not really about the camera price
as much as it is what the camera can do
it you know you should consider price
with respect to what it can do and
that's why I haven't chosen Canon
because what I've from what I've seen
Canon offers comparable performance
slightly better I mean none other dual
pixel autofocus is really good there are
certain Canon aspects that I would like
to have in my current cameras but I'm
not gonna pay three plus thousand
dollars for them not gonna happen
what's up heywood jablome he says hey
science I got to scroll down here I'm
pulling on behind a little bit
let's see bass said when will Intel
released their ninth gen CPUs nobody
knows Duden if they do they can't talk
about it
ciao can the mate book X pro game yes it
can you should watch my video because I
talked about whether or not it can game
let's see Jeff Phillips if beans are a
vegetable why not chocolate hmm I don't
think they're this same I don't think
they're from the same root if you know
what I mean I don't think they're it's
not like that it's I mean it's the
reason why what tomatoes are fruits
right most building tomatoes are
vegetables because they go in salads but
they're actually fruits by definition as
far as I'm aware
but and as far as I know that's not the
same relationship that you're trying to
make interesting you tried to catch me
off-guard though yeah you got close
there by the way folks these names
growing down below if you're wondering
how to get into that list these are all
the people that send me money basically
they're patreon supporters and they are
channel members on YouTube so if you're
wondering why people and the chat have
batteries next to their name that's
because they are channel members it's
like 5 bucks a month and you get special
badges and stuff to use in live streams
and in the comments sections of videos
and it just so is that you know you want
to support us a special little way not
required of course by any means but we
do appreciate all of our members and our
patreon supporters also we have our open
to the public discord down below we sure
that was science or while I almost said
science yes city that's namely discord
but we call it that because we are tag
teaming it with tech yes City so Brian
over there is good people and we have
good conversations we actually play a
lot of games too and the discord a lot
of pub gene stuff so you guys wanna head
on over there you can talk with us off
the livestream about anything and
everything basically and sometimes we
you know the voice chats and we talk
with people too so if you feel like it's
worth your time I invite you to check it
out
coalition Jamie says Craig sounds like
like if Greg had a really scuff twin
brother yeah it's a much like to me like
Greg is like like a super unintimidating
name you know it's not it's not like for
something ferocious I don't know I think
of like Russian names and I think of
like some like hardcore or rough names
but now Greg to me is like the most
unintimidating name on the planet
let's see scrolling down here heywood
jablome asks where do you get your hair
cut I actually cut it myself believe it
or not I'm not even joking
I just stand in front of a mirror and
just chop it up I'll use the razor
sometimes and trim the sides and kind of
fade it up top and then uh or you know
did like the transitions and the hardest
parts always back because you can't
really see the back step they're like
turn around in the mirror and act like
you're you know act like you're doing it
right and hope that you cut straight but
that's it yeah it's and I do it because
I it saves me time it saves me money
I'd rather not drive to a barber and
then pay a barber 20 bucks plus a tip
you know when I can do it myself for
free and I can cut it exactly the way I
want it and I've done it so many times
now that I'm actually pretty good at
sculpting it the way I want I not
confident off to open a barber shop or
anything but confident enough to want to
save twenty plus dollars and an hour of
driving so yeah there's that
all right let's here scrolling okay the
killer say science 2d I'm getting a 92
TI refurbished back from gigabyte on
Monday from an RMA I play at 1440p and
was wondering if I should wait until the
2070 GPU to release to upgrade thoughts
no I don't think you're gonna want to do
that unless you feel like spending 500
plus USD on that I mean look at 90 DTI
is gonna be comparable to gtx 1070 and
those cards are perfectly capable in
1440p so I don't really need to upgrade
unless you feel like throwing money at
Nvidia for record that is gonna be
better we don't know how much better yet
it all really depends on how these cards
perform and we'll find that out shortly
within the next week or so David Moore
it's another $10 super check my dude
want to team up to build a 20 for gamers
one CPU system for a not a local
nonprofit child care center no companies
want to listen to me want to make
history with me that sounds really
intense my dude really intense 24 gamers
one CC system yeah I don't even think I
have the connections to pull it off
that would require a very expensive CPU
and several graphics cards and I I don't
know any AIB or I don't have anybody who
would send me that many graphics cards
either so I will see I think that's a
stretch so I don't think you need 24
gamers in one CPU if you want to do
something for a non-profit child care
center you could you know depending on
what they need like if they want really
beast gaming systems I think they would
be fine with some cheaper and gaming
systems they could still do the job like
they don't need the best of the best
especially when it's for charity I think
you know something that's reasonable
that'll still solve the problem is what
I would shoot for so it might be a
little overkill there but I do like the
direction if you have any more thoughts
on that you can tweet at me or you can
message me and discord
strangelove what's your opinion on the
promises of strong AI not really sure
yet look AI is a really weird thing that
we keep hearing thrown around and in all
reality AI can AI can be used so many
different ways and you know they talk
about AI and tensor cores and RT cores
and stuff for the purposes of ray
tracing and computing and predicting
they have lot of a lot of 3d modeling
systems and forecasting systems and all
this stuff that uses this architecture
very well and they all they dub all that
AI right but in all reality artificial
intelligence is just a way for a system
to replicate algorithms and predict
things based on you know past
experiences you're trying to get it to
think for itself
based on historical context based on
data you can have things read you can
have systems read entire text books you
know in in a minute and that that system
will spit any info back at you but
getting it you know to the point where
it's aware where it wants to learn more
and it learns languages and it just
that's where it gets scary and we're
literally were there folks I mean we're
right on the edge of this so you know AI
it takes on many forms is what I'm
trying to say it can mean like the
literal AI when you think of like
Terminator Judgment Day stuff or it can
mean just the simple things behind how
you know graphics cards interpret motion
and stuff like that you can use AI for a
ton of stuff and honestly it's kind of
like a marketing gimmick now like
they'll say it's a you know artificial
intelligence you know blah blah blah
blah blah it's AI think it's a word
that's been overused to the point where
it doesn't mean what it used to mean
that's that's my take on it okay let's
see here see a lot of good questions
folks see a lot of good stuff Billy at
science to do have you ever used an EVGA
CLC someone needs to have them rework
their software to match the quality of
the hardware oh no I haven't actually
used one I've seen a lot of other tech
tubers use them and promote them I've
just never I know the coolers look okay
to me but they don't stand out any in
any unique way in my opinion so it's
just something that I've never jumped
into I could I mean I could get them to
someone I'm sure tomorrow but it's just
another AIO that uses a pump that other
AIS use and that's really about it it's
gotta be something weird you know at
this point like AI always have to be
super strange you have to have some
unique pump design or some weird
radiator
you know array or something to stand out
enough to where I feel like reviewing it
unless you guys are just looking for
performance and in most cases AI owes
are gonna perform comparably to each
other because they all use similar pumps
that's just the truth of the matter so
yeah okay excuse me let's see someone
says something about fps being locked in
witcher 3
Moustafa a lot so or a loss to my stuff
mustafa allah that's how you say your
name I think Witcher 3 if it's locked at
60fps you have vsync on so what it
sounds like scrolling down here that's I
see some good stuff Fabrice Co Gonzalez
is hi I want to play fortnight I don't
play fortnight cuz I think it's dumb
I'll probably get crucified for saying
that by certain fan bases but I just
don't like
fortnight at all della Crawford advice
for high school freshmen my dude grades
matter I don't care what anyone says
grades matter take that from somebody
who is in that I mean I'm about to
finish my grade career right in school
like I'm I'm gonna be finished with my
masters in business and a month and I'll
finally be able to say that school
grades no longer pertain to me other
than my historical grades right but
you're gonna be graded on everything in
life you might not get A's B's and C's
and everything else in your daily work
life but people are grading you your
boss is grading you you know your
co-workers are evaluating you you're
getting watched by customers if you're
in the service industry no matter what
you're always gonna have to worry about
performance and
raids are a way to gauge that I don't
always agree with the way that grades
align with performance metrics they
sometimes there's curve sometimes there
aren't sometimes the professors suck a
big time I had a thermodynamics
professor who sucked a big time if he's
watching this video you sucked a big
time but you know that's just life
you're gonna have to deal with stuff
like that and I think grades teach you
how to manage and how to play the game
because if you're in a job and let's say
your boss likes it one way and you're
used to doing in another way you got to
play the game you got to do what your
boss tells you to do if you want to
impress them and keep a job you know so
it's it's it's discipline you know it's
it's just academic discipline some
people will be perfectly fine in life
without caring about grades
some people flunked out of high school
and are millionaires billionaires now
but that's that's the exception all
right it's not the norm and that's what
I want to stress so when I say grades
matter it's not because I had good
grades in school it's not because I
valued my education it's because the
world cares about grades and you're
they're never going away you'll stop
seeing a B's and C's but you'll see
evaluations performance evaluations
throughout your career I'm certain of it
so yeah this is where life matters high
school and up this is where it's this is
where it counts so no pressure no
pressure anything all good my dude all
right let's see Thomas Slav Selleck do
you believe we have reached the maximum
of how much we can increase horsepower
by reducing size even invidious CEO said
that we have reached the maximum of
Moore's law what's your opinion I have a
video on this actually what's what's
next right where does Moore's law kind
of fall apart because we're at the end
of that right now Moore's law was like I
think seven nanometer or five
millimeters where it's stopped but we
always find ways to to get around those
barriers right with quantum tunneling
and things preventing us from getting
smaller than that from a node
perspective right when it comes to the
transistor size the gaps between
transistors and power tolerances and all
of that carbon nanotubes and stuff like
that that are ways to get around that
issue i I don't think we're ever gonna
hit a wall per se I mean we're always
gonna find a way to innovate to innovate
and that's something that has sparked so
much innovation in the past
that race to be the first person to do
something to make it work the way it's
intended to work so yeah I think with
respect to anything and I have to be
cpu's it could be cars it could be jets
planes cellphones whatever I mean all
that kind of relates to it you know but
you know what I mean it there's there's
really never a limit I don't think
because we're always gonna find a new
way to do something and we have since
the beginning of time so we'll see other
than like cutting bread I mean there's
no way to simplify cutting bread I don't
think other than like having a machine
or robot do it for you but then it's
kind of what we're complicated at the
same time because look how complex the
robot is you know and all you're having
to do is cut bread so you're kind of
taking a hundred thousand steps
backwards to do a simple task anyway
yeah innervated with innovation did I
say it like that oh gosh I really dread
sometimes I go back and watch these live
streams and I'm just like you know this
is what happens this is when we have a
live stream you just it's off-the-cuff
folks and that's why if you plan on
watching these are the ones to watch
because not because I care about how
many people are watching the live stream
I mean how many people are watching
right now 264 too bad on a Sunday night
I'm actually pretty impressed that this
many people are willing to deal with my
voice for this long we are about an hour
in or so so we'll answer maybe 10 or so
more questions depending on how long and
dense they are and then we'll move on
let's see Regan Marcellus wait a moment
how is this tuber involved with my man
Brian I feel so dumb and out of the loop
now techy sed aka yes man is the
greatest youtuber yes sir Brian and I
have tag team the the discord for quite
a while and he's good company Brian's a
good guy genuine guy straight up he'll
just tell you how he feels and I respect
that in people you know you can't hurt
somebody's feelings if they want you to
tell them exactly what they feel you
know and and I like that I like being
told what people think of me to my face
not behind my back not sugar-coated I
don't like any of that I'm a straight
shooter and I expect people do would do
the same to me as I intend to do to them
sometimes that Rose people the wrong way
you know I don't
I'm not in the business of making
friends per se I'm in the business of
making videos that are enjoyable and
educational that all of you are willing
to watch and obviously if they weren't
enjoyable and educational you probably
wouldn't watch them and I would go out
of business so there you go
okay let's see okay DV in X 1701 he says
Craig first off my name is Greg it's G r
e G there you go does Tron still fight
for the users yes he does
I love Tron Tron zantron legacies a good
movie the original Tron school too but
Tron Legacy like I don't know that kind
of got mixed reviews but I thought it
was really awesome oh yeah now
everyone's saying Greg more like Craig
oh my gosh I'm gonna do it
there we go there it is mmm Oh Cody says
can I get an F in the chat restore my
MacBook and nothing's working rip F Cody
laughs that blows dude strange lifts
this Craigslist I've had people tell me
that I should call the playlist that but
not all of our videos are Craigslist
videos in that playlist so I keep it I
read cuz it's just I basically read
stuff and talk about it anyway you guys
are interested in like it's really weird
because you guys like the videos that
require the least amount of time to
produce just so you know like I put time
and effort into some videos that get 10
or 20,000 views versus videos that take
20 minutes to put together no get a
million views you know and I'm just like
what the heck
because then I'm reassessing the entire
like validity of the channel and like
what I'm actually doing with my life
because I'm spending all this time to
get 10,000 views which at a CPM of 1 I
mean is a dollar per thousand views you
know it's not really a lot of money for
all the work put in the video so uh yeah
I don't think you guys realize how
little I mean how not much money we make
for video if your CPM is anything higher
than - you're doing pretty good let's
assume for all intents purposes CPM is
to its cost per Milla
you know how much money you get paid per
thousand views and you can look at your
total view count versus your you know
monthly revenue and kind of break that
down or you can just base it off of the
amount of money or in per video some
videos make like 10 dollars straight up
on this on this channel I'll make from
one a certain video only 10 bucks other
videos and make to 300 dollars but some
videos make ten dollars you know and
that and that's just the that's just the
way of the game you don't know what
videos to an extent will do well on
YouTube and which ones won't it really
depends on several factors whether a
video shared via you know goes viral
let's say it's shared on it on a a
subreddit of a let's say AMD subreddit
or Intel subreddit or PCMR subreddit and
it gets a ton of views through that
that's a whole different audience that I
wasn't talking to in the video directly
that is now watching the video so
there's a whole massive use there let's
say it was shared on Forbes or you know
CNN or fox or MSNBC or one of the news
stations you know all those different
outlets are ways for me to gain to get
views outside of just my average
subscriber base and the videos that do
that are it's difficult to predict you
don't really know it takes a certain
person Pepsi just opened the door out on
the hill how she cats are evolving
anyway yeah but um she's she's and she's
interesting
oh yeah you know the YouTube game is
it's it's an up and down game and you
that's why it's really difficult it was
difficult especially in the beginning to
decide to do this full-time because I've
said this before you know if I wanted to
work in my field of study I have an
engineering degree of petroleum
engineering degree I could work in the
field right now on a rig somewhere
making a hundred grand easy with a
master a master's degree MBA like I'm
about to have next month that's even
more money that maybe a 20k signing
bonus that's a lot more money than I'm
making now on YouTube and YouTube is not
certain I don't know tomorrow if my
channel is even gonna exist you could
YouTube could just delete it whenever
they want you know my hand my my hand
my fate rests in their hands and in your
hands ultimately if you decide not to
watch videos if all of you stopped
watching then I would make any money and
I have to move on and I'd probably go
back into the industry or do something
else you know whatever
I have options and that's what I wanted
to make sure that I had before I did
this full-time because you know there
are other people out there they don't
have those fall backs they don't have
they either don't have degrees or they
don't have prior experience in another
field and if their YouTube channel fell
apart tomorrow which is unlikely but if
it happened there you go so it really
just depends on on the the audience on
the the Creator him or herself you know
what they're doing with their content if
it takes a wrong turn then that's the
end of it in a lot of cases so yeah you
know just a little inside scoop you guys
want to know what goes on in my head on
a daily basis I wake up and say who my
channels still there and not that I have
a reason to be concerned that my channel
would disappear but anyway it's it's a
possibility nonetheless and and I check
revenue cuz I don't know what I'm gonna
make today you know how much money I can
make today versus yesterday versus
tomorrow I have no idea so you know it's
it's it's all up in the air let's see
Nextel says Gregory my dude do you like
the open source such as Linux and AMD
and so or you a performance guy with
respect to Linux I don't like I don't
like Linux I've used Linux like twice I
used it in a Chromebook I flashed a
linux over Chrome OS because I hated
Chrome OS and then I hated Linux more so
than I flashed Chrome OS back yeah
that's my very limited experience and
that software is not really my thing I I
dabble a little bit in it I can do some
basic stuff html5 little CSS I'm trying
to teach myself more about that am I
getting some more technical stuff C++
and whatnot eventually but I want to get
more involved in the software side
because up to this point it's just
basically hardware and I didn't learn
much of the software stuff in
engineering school because I wasn't an
electrical engineer I was more
mechanical so it never really filled the
gap there I'm so eventually I will I
think when I finished school I will jump
back into it just as like a part time
kind of study that I think will pay off
in the long run
yeah C++ HTML Java
yeah Java scripts another one I want to
learn JavaScript and even back-end stuff
you know whatever
let's see here grape hey I have a
question well the lower-end 20 series
cards because at 2050 nobody knows I
have no idea I'm sure if there are not
r-tx capable they'll still be called GTX
but I'm sure they'll be called the 2050
2060 that's what I would assume if it's
something other than that surprise
anyway Jeff Phillips don't quit your day
job what if you work nights
that's true that's true don't quit your
night job are you taking a leap of faith
man into YouTube full-time as a scary
thing but it's fun at the same time you
are kind of to an extent the master of
your own fate you know being your own
boss is kind of weird but fun and also
stressful I probably work 10 12-hour
days
it's it's happened quite a bit recently
you know you just keep working and
working and working you don't realize
that you should have stopped to eat
dinner you know and that's just one of
those side effects of working at home
and working for yourself so uh
and when I say working for myself I just
mean not having a boss per se so anyway
John Mark fqo says hey what channel are
you streaming with your wife on so
sometimes we stream that on YouTube but
most of the time it's streamed on her
twitch channel so Lisa's channel is
called no it's shifty Studio YT but she
has its twitch.tv slash 50 Studio YT
it's down below it's in the description
it'll say twitch and then you'll see
that URL click that URL and then that'll
take you to her page I invite you to
follow her if you want to subscribe
she'll appreciate that but all she does
is game there and she does she does a
few more things as well but primarily
gaming csgo even like world of warcraft
sometimes she'll do pop G in for at
night so it's not just like a single
game that she plays but she loves doing
that and she's a good she's a good
streamer she really is or sheep she pays
attention to the chat Pepsi's up here
and she's stepping on everything Pepsi
you want to say hi you want to say hi
say hi it's Beth
getting her name's Pepsi she's gonna
scratch me don't you want to go up there
she ain't no she ain't having it Ochs
you ain't having it alright alright I'll
let her do her thing anyway folks what's
the ninja I see a $10 Canadian think of
that super chap might do just a few
bucks for good content week in and week
out my dude we'll keep watching as long
as you keep making videos I appreciate
that like your support matters each and
every one of you mattered to me even if
I notice view counts going down
subscriber rates slowing down doesn't
matter the guys that watch the girls
that watch I know who you are
and I see all the time and the live
streams in the comments I do I read all
the comments within the first at least a
few hours of the videos posting because
I want to get impressions what you guys
think about the videos it kind of tells
me what to do next
and I really appreciate those people who
watch every video regardless even if you
know what the topics about if you know
the answers to the questions asked in
the video you guys supporting me by
watching the video our videos in
question is really awesome so thank you
for that I'm gonna answer let's say one
or two more questions and then we're
gonna pivot on over to Lisa's twitch
stream we are almost ready for that
she is in the other room about to start
that up I'm gonna send her a chat or
I'll just yell she's in the other room
and get her to fire that up right with
me in this one so let's see it's real
Joe jaar jaar jaar Equis god I can't say
that last name anyway he says what's
your current daily driver smartphone
that daily driver is the LGV 30
I love the V 30 I love the screen to
body ratio I love the fact that it has a
headphone jack it's a decent camera
setup it's not the best camera setup by
any means but I've gotten used to the V
30 and I also routed this so it's a lot
faster now and it has it's running a
custom ROM which is something that I
haven't done in quite a while I used to
route all my phones back when I was
trading them in high school but now that
this one's routed I'm just like back to
the good old days so anyway excuse me
okay Brian York or Ryan your excuse me
says how do you feel about paid
advertising in your channel we don't do
it as much as other tech tubers a lot of
the bigger guys they'll have ads in
every video every video they'll have an
ad
smart because it means that you're
guaranteed some money per video even if
the video doesn't do well you're still
making money from those ads and usually
they're contracted for like four or
eight or twelve ads over the course of
two or three months and it's insurance
basically you know it guarantees you
income a certain amount of it that you
can kind of gauge we don't have that in
most videos we don't have paid content
most videos are not sponsored but the
ones that do obviously you'll know when
they are you know this video is brought
to you by usually is what I'll say or
I'll do something weird and quirky and
then I'll put you know sponsor and the
description and you'll see that very
rarely do we do full-on paid videos just
because the reception on those is
usually really low people know that
they're paid so they don't really trust
what's said and I understand that to an
extent so the paid video is you're gonna
see a lot fewer I mean we haven't done
many of those anyway but I kind of want
to phase this out altogether I don't I
like product placements those are nice
like when the company pays us to use a
case or to you know make a an
instructional video or something like
that those are cool because to me those
are still informative they're not biased
because you're not reviewing anything
you're not giving an opinion while the
same time being paid which is a conflict
of interest but you're you're you're you
know building relationships of these
companies and it keeps like I said it
keeps me kind of in check because I know
I'm getting at least this amount of
money per video which is a good thing
you know it's not like a toss up every
time I open the you know YouTube channel
analytics every morning and say how much
money did I make you know you just don't
know versus working a regular job I
worked eight hours at ten bucks an hour
I made eighty bucks you know my less
taxes so it's not like that here but
that does help it's peace of mind and
it's it's actually in certain cases it's
necessary and and maybe even vital at
some points like if you're not pulling
enough money in from YouTube alone
depending on your size of if you know
your your work how many people you have
working for you how big your business is
it might be completely necessary twisted
ninja if I don't like an Edomite dude
again don't forget to like the videos
and subscribe guys much appreciate it
again for that
support you are a bomb calm let's see
John mark FK good question do you get
revenue if we don't finish the video all
the way and the answer is yes look if
you see an ad and even if you skip the
ad if you still see it that means that
we brought an ad from an outside source
through YouTube to you we get
compensated for that now it's tiny tiny
amounts per view it's like fractions of
pennies it's literally not even one
penny per view but it all adds up so if
a thousand people watch you know that
that is where it really starts well its
thousand people at $1 CPM still that's
only a dollar but you know if you have
hundreds of videos in your playlist and
they're still being watched occasionally
and plus you have the new videos coming
out and all that stuff that's how you
make a living because all that money
kind of adds up per day but yeah if
you've seen that at all we get paid for
if you use an ad blocker of any sort we
don't get paid so if you don't see any
ads we don't get paid for them because
you didn't see them and that's just
something that we have to take on as
risk at least 50% of our viewer base
uses an adblock I can tell you that just
from our channel analytics the ones that
are on mobile usually are the ones that
we get ad revenue from because they
don't typically block ads on mobile but
anyone using an ad blocker and Chrome or
whatever as an extension that results
must not being paid period not that that
doesn't help us still I'd still rather
you watch us then not watch us if you
have an ad blocker but it's just that's
just how it is yeah let's see scrolling
down okay frog she says cats greater
than dogs
interesting is Greg a weeaboo oh my gosh
look you don't have to turn I mean if
you're running an ad blocker 24/7 you
don't have to turn it off to watch me
it's I don't expect you to change your
ways just for me I know how annoying ads
can be just know that when you're
running that we don't get paid and
that's something that we have to Romi we
we hade from you watching ads whether it
be embedded ads from companies like a
Sue's and EVGA and whoever else or
straight up you know
Google Adsense from implanted ads that
you see pre-rolls basically in front of
YouTube videos by the way anyway I'll
leave you guys with that I appreciate
the good question to get conversations I
hope I shed some light on the stuff that
happens in the background here on the
channel I want to be as transparent as
possible you know and I'm still I'm
actually kinda planning whether or not
to even show you guys how much I
actually make how much I net per month I
just I kind of want all that out there
cuz some of you think that we make tons
of money and that's like the that could
not be further from the truth we do okay
but we're not making you know we're not
making six figures it's not it's not
like we're doing really well relatively
speaking I could still be making again
like I said more money in the oil field
but I think at some point you know I'm
gonna be just totally out there and just
show you guys break down exactly how
much we make and where it all comes from
some people will never do that and
that's totally fine I respect that but I
don't think it hurts for you guys to
know what your contribution actually
amounts to in terms of dollars because
maybe the more you know the more
comfortable you are with me the more you
trust me that's what I want I want you
guys to trust me when I when I review
products when I tell you like it is you
know how I see things my perspective
it's why you watch you know me you watch
me from my opinions you watch Kyle for
his opinions you watch Brian for his
opinions and you guys at least respect
those enough to watch our videos and and
I want to continue that by being more
transparent in the future so we'll see
I'm still again debating how much of
that I want to reveal up front but at
some point I will talk straight-up
numbers with you guys so stick around
and I'm sure you won't be disappointed
with the content we have coming up here
very soon you guys have been awesome I
appreciate the questions this will be
archived you'll be able to watch it on
the channel in the future if you just
tuned in you can be able to you'll be
able to scroll back and watch the old
stuff all the other questions and you
can see the chat scrolling by the way

once if you're down here I appreciate
your support
