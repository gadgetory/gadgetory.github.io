late to the party so I figured I'd give
you everything in one lump sum and one
advantage I do have in this regard is
the ability to test right on latest
offerings in terms of drivers and the
most recent driver the one that I use
for all of these tests was released on
July 16th so it's rather modern I plan
to test six different cards they're all
in front of me you can't see them but
it's a lot of them here and prices range
from the low to mid to hundreds up to
the high 400s depending on where you
look so hold on to your pants
the be quiet dark rock slim maybe small
but it also packs one heck of a punch
won't interfere with your system RAM
because it's super slim it's also super
easy to install and it looks mighty fine
and virtually any brick oh and did I
mention the cooler runs quiet I know
nothing in the products name would have
suggested it okay
I'll be quiet now grab the dark rock
slim via the link in this video's
description by this point I'm sure
you're already familiar with how both
meet 5700 and xt reference cards look
love it or hate it the xt variant sports
the signature dent next to the right
illuminated Radeon logo it also has a
backplate whereas the 5700 the cheaper
of the two does not both support an 8 +
6 pin supplement of power config and
both run fairly hot to say the least I'm
gonna get thermals out of the way first
because I think it'd be unfair to
compare reference cards which
traditionally run hot to AI B's with
custom air coolers out of the box Navi
in its reference form is hot very hot
this graph represents idle and low GPU
temps for each card the load scenario
until a 30 minute 3d mark fire strike
ultra loop low temps our max temps in
this case clearly our AMD cards are
struggling a bit particularly the newest
reference models the other cards on this
chart come nowhere close to this
temperature under load even our
reference RT X 2060 this is technically
a reference card I'll be it's also
Nvidia calls of the founders of sedition
cards but these are designed much
differently and as a result they run a
much quieter and cooler under load I do
expect a I B's will perform
significantly better in this regard and
it's one of the reasons why I suggest
you wait a while before buying one of
the 57 hundreds by the way I'd take
these idle temps here with a grain of
salt some of these cards shut off their
fans below a certain temperature so
they're inclined to stay a bit hotter
for longer under idle conditions and as
you can expect the hotter cards tend to
run a bit louder with the Radeon 5700
and XT models topping the charts at
around 44 decibels apiece our mega 56
card that's this beefy card right here
AIB from power color actually ran pretty
quiet under load but was plagued with
coil whine which brought it up to around
40 decibels this would have been around
38 decibels had the coil whine not been
present it's that loud I actually just
ran the card with fans to about the same
rpm as what they were under load and of
course the cards technically not under
load when you're just you know spooling
up the fans so that came out around 30
decibels so yeah bit of coil line there
and it's detectable in this mega 56
variant but the other cards really
didn't have much of that speaking of
which I haven't properly introduced the
other cards tested here first we have
the gigabyte RTX 2070 super it's the
most expensive card in our list but also
the most powerful and if you're into
realistic reflections and flashy
lighting baked-in arty and tensor cores
are a nice bonus it all depends on who
you are and what you play now in
addition to the 2070 super we have the
2070 from gigabyte and this one's in
white so it's easy for me at least to
distinguish between the two it has a
noticeably smaller cooler you can see
it's not as beefy as the 2070 Super but
it still delivers excellent thermal
performance and cooling metrics up next
is the RT X 2060 this is the FE model
and I've covered it in a dedicated video
up here my thoughts really haven't
changed much since then last we have the
Vega 56 I just showed you from power
color in the mix because why not
alright Vega cards have come down
considerably in price as of late and I'm
curious how it stacks up to some of the
bigger boys on this list it just might
be able to punch above its weight class
so with that out of the way the last
thing to quickly address is our test
bench 8600 K 16 gigs of DDR for a Z 370
motherboard from MSI and to be quiet
dark rock slim our operating system is
loaded onto a SATA m2 and all games were
loaded from a 2 terabyte hard drive and
for those wondering our core i5 wasn't a
bottleneck in any of these scenarios I
bumped up anti-aliasing and other things
that are gonna put a heavy load on the
graphics card in fact the only scenario
in which the CPU was even being somewhat
heavily utilized was in 3d mark where
our our overall scores would include the
CPU results as well graphics scores
though are differentiated and I included
those in our graphs so I started with
remark firestrike and this will give us
a general assessment of graphical
horsepower in the dx11 api and to my
surprise the 5700 xt did an excellent
job keeping up with the higher price
2070 super there was a bit of variance
in our CPU scores but overall things
were virtually
neck and neck and to be honest the 5700
wasn't far behind that's the nan XT
variant moving on to fire strike extreme
which bumps the res up to 1440p the gap
is nearly identical I'm seriously
shocked here you'd think for the price
the 5700 XT would be falling behind as
it becomes the bottleneck but nope let's
hope this continues into our other games
though but quickly our last fire strike
testifier strike ultra in 4k and yet the
two are trading blows yet again good
news for the red team so far at least
moving on to grand theft auto 5 you'll
find a very similar trend the 2070 super
of course comes out on top followed by
its non-super counterpart followed by
the 5700 xt interesting note here the
two latest raid on cards struggled hard
down low with the lowest one percent and
point one percent of frames especially
coming in at under 40 FPS suggesting
infrequent and sharp stuttering our Vega
56 card came in last but it's also the
cheapest card on this list by far and
held its own even among the lowest 1%
and 0.1% of frames up next f1 2017
literally flips the script with respect
to our lower frame averages I was kind
of shocked by this our r-tx card
struggled a great deal here literally
all of them and I'm not sure why exact
same settings in 1440p I really can't
even say I've seen this in some of my
older tests so I'm not sure this is like
the specific driver that's causing these
issues or if it's a game update I have
no idea when I can say however is that
average frame rates fall in line roughly
where we'd expect them to further down
the list the 50 720 60 nearly taeyeon
average and the xt actually outperforms
the super across-the-board by the way
all of these benches were conducted at
least twice for consistency's sake if I
thought numbers were a bit too far apart
between runs I ran a third test to
narrow down the variance just in case
you're wondering or doubting these
numbers I wanted to test a few games
with newer api's as well and that that's
where games like ashes of the
singularity and shadow of the Tomb
Raider come in here I honestly expected
the RX 5700 XT to win and it did come
awfully close in fact medium and heavy
loads were nearly indistinguishable as
for the 5700 well yeah it absolutely
creamed the Arctic
20 60 and nearly tied our Vega 56 which
mind you is a 100 USD cheaper on eBay in
dx12 again shadow of a Tomb Raider gave
us a win for the 5700 over the r-tx 2060
but a loss for the XT model over the
2070 super this is an Nvidia optimized
title after all but it'd be nice to see
things scale rather linearly here with
respect to price and that is what we're
seeing for the most part even 95%
averages scale this way in 1440p with
the highest preset and a bit of
anti-aliasing another non dx11 title
that I was sure to test was a doom in
the Vulkan API everything performed
incredibly well across the board and
e-card struggled a bit more download to
my surprise but the experience all
around was definitely playable nailed to
preset and perhaps this says a bit more
about the API and less about the cards
themselves since virtually every one of
them was hitting in the 200 FPS cap at
some point I should also point out that
this benchmark is entirely dependent on
my ability to retrace steps the idea is
to be as repetitive as possible to
introduce this little variance as
possible and it isn't always perfect
lastly a tested Witcher 3 is a pretty
graphically intensive game and again our
RX 5700 fell a bit short among the
lowest point 1 percent of frames in fact
it was definitely noticeable while
benchmarking there were several stutters
here and there and that said in terms of
overall averages we don't see anything
really out of place the 5700 ties of the
2060 and the xt keeps up with the 2070
nvidia cards do tend to perform a bit
better here which is why i'm always sure
to turn off things like hair works in
the ultra preset what I ultimately think
this comes down to though is driver
optimization we're still in the early
stages for these aren't our X cards for
the 5,700 NXT and if you look at our
Vega 56 actually that's a card that's
been allowed to mature for quite a while
now manage quite well even down low so
we'll revisit games like these at a
later date once the drivers have matured
so from the games tested here my
conclusion is this Nvidia cards by and
large are still running a bit more
expensive what you're getting though for
that trade-off is a lower TDP which
translates more effective cooling you
get quieter cards in general as a
consequence of that you get driver sets
that at least in my experience aren't
always as bulky out of the gate and yeah
look that's
I do think the RX said you said 100 and
XP variants are great values despite
what they give up and we're just talking
about reference cards here I do expect a
IDs to do better jobs in the cooling
Department pretty typical and not an
outlandish expectation I also expect
drivers to improve with time certain
games will fare better than others we
saw the XT occasionally trading blows
with higher price 20 70s but the fact
remains that Nvidia cards at this point
are more refined is that AMD's fault
kind of but kind of not and to say all
that to say this if I was buying a solid
1440p graphics card today I'd honestly
pick none of these cards I still think
the 27 TS are too expensive in their AI
be forms justify the often marginal
performance gains over early 57 or XT
samples and even RT X 20 60s and in my
opinion our Tech's 2060s are almost kind
of redundant I think that the 1660 ti
comes awfully close in many games and
lacks RT and tensor cores to keep the
price nice and low it can handle 1440p
albeit with a few in-game compromises
and stays nice and cool thanks to a
low-power draw and thermal output as it
stands the RX 5700 and XT are great
values but they come with hefty
compromises in their current forms which
I expect AI DS to change it's only a
matter of time and then we can compare
true value for money cards speaking of
which a bit off-topic here I must shift
to this card I think that our Vega 56
from power color surprised me it
actually would trade blows with the 1660
ti which I mean that's pretty good at
this price point it is gonna consume
more power but this one's got a beefy
cooler to keep temps in check and sound
didn't check worth considering if you're
in the market for a used card that packs
a punch that's all for this one though
