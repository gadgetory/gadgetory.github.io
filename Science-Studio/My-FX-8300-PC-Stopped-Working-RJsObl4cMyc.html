up a few days ago unexpectedly the
computer behind me is featuring the FX
8350 nat build already I attempt to show
you the build in three minutes or less
in a youtube video that you can check
out in the card above me but nonetheless
I put it together and I ran it through a
series of benchmarks and then I also put
it up head-to-head against the i3 6100
if you haven't seen that video you can
also check that one out in the card
above me if the one before hand has
finally moved out of the way but I like
the PC it honestly is pretty good and
what I wanted to do for this video was
edit everything and record everything on
the I should also kind of minimizes
someone told me this was just just
trashy to keep to keep my my audio
script up here it's just trashy right
whatever I'll minimize it but I wanted
to show you that I that this this build
will allow you to video edit and audio
edit do all of that no problem the 8
cores and the CPU are more than plenty
for what you need to do video editing
wise now it's nothing like an i7 or Xeon
speaking of which I have a xeon build on
the way it will be here when i moved
back to florida over the weekend so -
stay tuned for that but in in this
regard i had a problem because this
computer stopped working on me two days
ago and this was after I had already
benched it against the 6100 and I
thought that the overclock was stable
now the aleph was hard to do it was
hard to get it to 4.4 and that's like
that that's uncommon because most FX
processors will get to 4.0 4.4 and no
problem like you really don't have to
change much of anything at all in some
cases they don't have to change the
voltage I think 1.3 5 or 1 point 4 volts
some of them kind of vary but the stock
voltage out of the box is usually good
enough for a 4 point 4 gigahertz
overclock and so when I overclocked it
for the sake of the benchmarks 24.4 from
its I think it turbos to 4 point 2
yeah turbos to 4 point 2 so it's already
doing that on its own out of the box so
when extra 200 megahertz really isn't
going to stress it all that much right
and that's what I expected but it was it
was actually quite troublesome to get it
to 4 point for the computer was quite
unstable and I was using a very good
cool I used the x31 cracking from NZXT
which I used to cool my
Center K before I purchased my x60
coolant 280 millimeter ad which is in
that PC currently but I expected the x31
Akula just find it was having trouble
doing so and I wasn't sure whether to
blame the the water cooler and that was
that was gonna be really tough for me
because the water cooler was actually a
very good cooler or just to blame the
processor and just you know striking out
on the silicon lottery deal so I looked
further into the issue and this I
especially further into it after the
computer crashed on me and would not
turn back on I should clarify okay so I
turned the computer on this was two days
ago after I'd already benchmarked
everything and I would get so I would
get a response from the tower itself the
LEDs would turn on the CPU fan would act
strange it would turn on and then it
would stop turning in an attempt to turn
a few times I have some clips of that
that you're seeing right now but it
would behave erratically like that and
the most noticeable and most troublesome
part about this was the fact that I
wasn't getting any feed to the monitor
whatsoever and so that's what I want to
talk about in this video very briefly as
are the steps that I went through to fix
the issue and it wasn't actually many
steps at all and and that's what I kind
of want it I guess pass along to you if
you don't already know about this little
step here because it could save you a
lot of time in the long run because I
can I can imagine a lot of people
putting together PC for the first time
and then having this problem not having
any signal being sent to the monitor and
then just arming everything just
returning it all back to the vendor back
to Newegg back to Amazon you know having
to pay for that return shipping which I
find to be quite ridiculous and then
waiting all over again for new parts to
arrive and crossing your fingers hoping
that the same problem doesn't arise
again so to fix this issue for a lot of
you I think this is this is something
that's it's good to know and I'm sure a
lot of you do know this and I'm sure I'm
just preaching to the choir here but I
would like to tell you what I did to fix
the issue so I wasn't getting any signal
to the monitor right but I was getting a
response from the computer so the first
thing I did was turn the computer off
and I am plugged the computer and I held
the power button down with the computer
completely unplugged from everything
this this drains a lot of the extra
juice that's stored in the capacitors
flushes all it out so the computer is
completely dead or almost completely
dead so you can start messing with stuff
on the PCB without worrying about
shorting things that are getting shocked
or whatever so with all that finished up
the first thing I decided to do was take
out the graphics card I took that out
and kind of check make sure everything
was okay there the graphics card in this
in the case of this build is is crucial
because there are no integrated graphics
on the FX 8300
built into the motherboard but this one
does not this is a gigabyte 990 FX board
but it does not have integrated graphics
on the board so because of that a
graphics card is vital without a
graphics card you won't have anything to
plug your computer into I mean there are
literally I know you can't see here but
there are no there are no device output
so no video outputs on the on the actual
rear i/o so you have to have a graphics
card there so the first thing I did was
take out the graphics card kind of
double-check make sure there weren't
anything weren't weren't things that
were I guess noticeably wrong with the
card you check the back of the PCB make
sure that you don't have any fried
resistors or transistors or any of that
stuff transistors but just things you
can tell that don't look right and I did
notice that the the BIOS which was set
to slave and I switched that back to to
the master slave and master that's old
stuff that's old school we're talking
like back in the IDE eras of hard disk
drives and CD drives and whatnot but I
switched that back to master now it was
working fine and slave before so I I'm
not sure that if that changed anything
at all but it should have been in master
because there's only one of them there
and that's the main BIOS for the
graphics card I believe so I switched
that back to master but that's not
really what fixed the issue because like
I said it was like that beforehand it
was in slayin and it worked just fine so
I kept the graphics card out and then
the second thing that I did which
alternate ly end up fixing the issue was
clearing my CMOS now the CMOS or CMOS
whatever you have II won't call it CMOS
K that is something that you want to
reset if you if you want to basically
wipe your bios I guess is the easy way
to say it so you clear your CMOS when
you want your BIOS settings completely
restored back to default so let's say
that you're overclocking your graphics
card and what they do you end up pushing
I don't know too high of a frequency
with not enough voltage so your
pyou isn't barely even booting up I mean
your your PC is turning on and it's
turning off right away there's nowhere
near enough voltage to sustain that
frequency and it keeps pooping out on
you over and over and over again just
keep shutting off instantaneously well
there's not much you can do there in
terms of hardware replacement right I
mean you can replace everything but
that's completely pointless and I can
see how in those situations people would
freak out ended up sending everything
back just because they don't know what
to do next and this is why I think this
video is important because the very
simple thing that you can do if you have
done something incorrectly within your
BIOS is clear CMOS nice clear musi most
completely wipes all of your previous
BIOS settings back to stock so the way
that you attained your motherboard and
plugged it in for the first time and
jumped into your BIOS oh that's how it
will look when your CMOS is cleared so
that's what I did
now I didn't find the jumper that
usually you can remove a jumper from the
far right two prongs to the to the far
left two prongs and then kind of cycle
through do a couple power cycles and
it'll wipe your your BIOS clean then but
it didn't I didn't I didn't find that I
didn't find the actual jumpers to switch
over so I ended up removing the battery
now in this particular case I end up
having to power the PC back on let it do
its whole boot loop thing that it kept
doing without sending signal to the
monitor and I I turned off the PC
unplugged it but I didn't drain all the
power out of the capacitors that's
important because once you hold that
button down that power button on the top
of the PC you've completely wiped out
all the juice that's stored in the
capacitor especially those capacitors
that are very close to the BIOS chip and
when you don't have power running the
BIOS chip with the battery remove or
with the CMOS jumper switch to the reset
position your BIOS will not reset and
nothing will happen at all so it's
important to have that extra juice
stored in there and that's why they
recommend immediately after turning off
your powers now after trying off your PC
either pulling out the battery or
switching the jumpers and then once that
happens you want to sit for about 10 or
15 minutes the recommended dose of time
wait that 10 or 15 minutes for the PC to
completely cycle through and reset your
CMOS and that's going to completely wipe
your BIOS clean it won't get rid of your
BIOS usually your BIOS will still be
there as long as you're not Q flashing
or anything like that so that it's
completely safe process but just note
that when you do this all of your
previous BIOS settings will be
completely
reset to stock so all of your overclock
settings all of your voltage settings
your your boot order all of that will be
completely restored so once you do clear
this and you either switch the jumper
back to the normal position or reinsert
the battery and then power back on your
PC everything's going to be reset so I
recommend going back into your BIOS and
changing the things that you know aren't
going to affect your PC's performance
like the boot order of Drive devices so
you want to make sure that your OS is on
the top of the boot list a few other
things you might want to change like
your fan speed stuff like that
when it comes to overclocking you want
to be especially sensitive for that
because that's likely what caused the
computer to not want to boot in the
first place so I recommend keeping that
as stock and keeping you know keeping
that equal to what it was out of the box
to ensure that that was the problem and
that was my problem the computer booted
up just fine after I reinserted the
battery after 15 minutes or so I was
actually more like 5 in my case but
you're supposed to wait 10 to 15 minutes
most of the time so what the scene was
cleared the computer booted up just fine
I ended up overclocking again back to
what I was at originally 4.4 if you're
thinking Greg you're going to run into
the same problem again and I probably
will but until that day comes I think
I'm gonna try to keep it here so that's
what I wanted this video to be about I
wanted you to see the steps that I ran
through the very simple steps and very
few steps that were required to fix the
issue so that's what I recommend doing
first and foremost a few computers not
sending a signal to your monitor
especially clear CMOS first off that
that could that I guarantee you 50% of
all cases that's the problem the other
50% being Hardware related issues which
are an entirely different nightmare but
apart from that let me know what you
think I want to hear from you I want to
hear about your stories about the
different centers you've come across
when you've dealt with pcs maybe ones
that you've built or that you purchase
pre-built what you encountered what kind
of problems you had or thought you had
and what you did to fix the issues I
think that would be nice for other
people to see who might be going through
the same experiences currently if you
like this video in the style format I've
kind of continued this laid-back
experience at least until I moved back
to Florida when I have my my new studio
completely set up and ready to go be
sure to give the video a thumbs up if
you feel that way if you feel good about
it if you don't like the video format
you didn't like the topic at hand give
it a thumbs down and tell me
