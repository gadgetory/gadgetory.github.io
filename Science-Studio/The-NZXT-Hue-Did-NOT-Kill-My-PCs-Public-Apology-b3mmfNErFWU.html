to all of you and to NZXT that my
conclusions based on the hue plus and my
two dead editing rigs were completely
wrong so let's talk about what I thought
was a cause right I took apart the hue
plus after both of my rigs died and I
found that resistor that was kind of
semi dislodged there was flux leaking
from it I assumed that was just a blown
resistor I had seen blown components on
circuit boards before that looked pretty
close according to NZXT and their
third-party source who examined the hue
plus and the power supply itself gamers
Nexus I'm sure most of you have heard of
them before they objectively looked at
the u+ determine that it actually worked
perfectly fine when I sent it back to
them the power supply said ended up
dying halfway through the test but they
had another one on hand and they
replicated my exact same procedure you
guys are gonna oh y'all are going to
grill me for what I'm about to tell you
so I didn't realize that I plugged in an
incorrect peripheral cable so the DQ
1000 which was the D equal power supply
was using when I was testing the hue
plus with the two rigs that is a semi
modular power supply which means that
the 24 pin and most of the time the EPS
is a pin CPU cable were wired directly
into the power supply everything else
was module which means I had to plug in
things to to in order to run them to the
other components in the case the
graphics cards all of the storage drives
and the hue plus the hue plus was the
only component in that rig that utilized
molex so I had to plug in a separate
cable into the power supply just to use
molex which kind of sucks because you
know it's it's like 1 cable but it's
really long and all you need it for is
one single peripheral but I had to use
it if I wanted to use it you plus and
the cable that I used was not the
correct cable for the DQ 1000 and gamers
Nexus did an excellent job at running
through they actually ran through both
of the videos and that's how they
realize that I didn't use the correct
cable actually NZXT come to that as well
I think before gamers Nexus was ever
involved and they said whoa that cable
you're using there isn't the correct
cable because the DQ 1000 K Buhl's are
solid black sleeve
labels and they're kind of stitched
together and this one here using is a
you know ketchup and mustard braided
cable so where did you get that from and
at first I was like I'm pretty sure
that's that's the correct cable because
the 24 pin and the 8 pin looked just
like that so I just assumed that it
would only I don't know what I was doing
I assumed that was the correct cable for
the power supply apparently it was not
and now I was hoping to run my own test
to show you guys firsthand how to
diagnose this problem correctly now that
we do know what the issue is a voltmeter
multimeter would have come in handy but
gamers Nexus already took care of that
they have the article they basically
typed out an entire summary ran through
all the tests that I was hoping to go
through anyway so they already knocked
all of it out I trust them 100% these
are smart guys I know what they're doing
so what happened was because I used the
incorrect peripheral cable for that
power supply the picture the the leads
the wires coming out of that power
supply from that six pin on the
peripheral side on the power supply side
those can be mismatched and crossed over
if you use the incorrect cable and the
DQ 1000 itself has a very bold you know
yellow sticker this is don't use
incorrect cables because they can be
braided incorrectly or you know line on
one end to an incorrect header on the
other side and then you'll be giving
power to the wrong pin and that was the
case with the molex connector running
into the hue plus so the correct cable
provided by deep cool pairs the five pin
on the bottom right and the common pin
the top left to provide power to any
connected 5 volt devices they cable the
Salazar studio used however is the one
in the bottom right this cable is
receiving 3.3 volts down on it's 5 pin
so it's supposed to be receiving 5 volts
on that pin it was only receiving 3.3
already off to a bad start and then on
the common cable which is that's
pictured ground okay that's ground so
that's where the current returns to the
power supply and that's that actually
had 12 volts running through that so
picture kind of like a scale so you have
12 volts on one side and you only have
3.3 on another so the difference there
12 - 3.3 you're going to have negative
what do they say I don't know that
differences negative eight point seven
volts I think is what they had when they
checked with their multimedia negative
eight point seven volts so what that
means is the hue plus was receiving an
incorrect voltage and of course when you
put together a PCB that's designed for
five volts and then you run eight point
seven volts in the opposite direction
things aren't gonna aren't going to end
well for you they didn't end well for
either of my editing rigs and that's
because because I use the incorrect
cable with the power supply it's I
didn't do it on purpose I genuinely
thought that that cable was the correct
cable for the DQ 1000 it was not and as
a result I fried to my rage so I would
like to apologize personally I can't do
it in person but I would like to
apologize via video to NZXT for
misleading so many people into believing
that the U Plus was the cause of the
deaths of both of my editing rigs it
clearly was not and I cannot say
anything else other than I really
screwed up and just overlooked something
that should not have been overlooked and
I apologize to all of you as well
all of my viewers I know those views
those videos have 120 hundred and thirty
thousand views and so a lot of people
saw that a lot of people share that and
and we're scared at the fact that the U
Plus could potentially kill their
systems too and I know that really cut
into NZXT sale of that of that unit so I
am what I'm going to do is I'm going to
go back and delete all three of those
videos so the first video where I'm like
what the heck's going on the second
video where I said ha I think I know
what it is in the third video where I
said yeah I'm pretty sure I know what it
is all three of those videos are very
misleading so I'm going to go back and
delete all three of them you know
there's nothing else that I can really
do at this point the videos that are
shared and the things that already
talked about are kind of already out
there but I hope that you guys will at
least accept this apology and do your
best to tell other people who are
worried about the U Plus to let them
know about this let them know what I've
said in this video if you can share it
on forums share it wherever you need to
share it just tell people that the hue
plus didn't kill two of my systems and
that Salazar had no idea what he was
talking about he was just not paying
attention so that's basically what it
comes down to I just didn't pay
attention to it
NZXT was a very cool about following
through filling me in on all the tests
that were that were being run i'd like
to specifically thank Wesley for for
being so cool being patient with me and
not wanting to chop my head off because
I know that's probably what I made them
feel like just by by what I've been
talking about in my videos so that's
that's it that's that's what I want to
say I apologize I was wrong at least we
know now what was actually causing the
issue so the power supply was just
tripping out because incorrect voltages
were being sent down incorrect wires and
it was just it was tripping because it
had no idea what to do with the voltage
being supplied to that single peripheral
one last thing I would like to do is
thank gamers Nexus for following through
on this for for me and for NZ XT and for
the community thanks for clarifying this
thanks for telling me that I was wrong I
appreciate that thanks for providing
very solid facts what was said in in the
article is what I'm telling you now and
it's I'm just glad that it's out there
like I said I'm gonna delete three
videos and just please share this video
or share what I've talked about with
anybody who has concerns about the U
Plus I am actually going to prove a
point I'm gonna have another NZXT hue in
my system just to show you guys that it
had nothing to do with that at all so
this is Salazar studio thanks for thanks
for watching and thanks for watching the
apology video I hope I don't have to do
many more of these I will do my best
from now on to to make sure that I have
all the facts before I make a conclusion
like that again thanks for watching I
will catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
