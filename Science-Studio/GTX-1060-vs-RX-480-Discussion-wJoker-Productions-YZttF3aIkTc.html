joined today by greg from science to do
we're going to be sitting down for kind
of a casual discussion on the gtx 1060
as well as the RX 480 so for people that
aren't may be familiar with you Greg
what do you do over on your channel oh
well but what it looks like pretty much
the same stuff you do just review a
bunch of Technology a lot of
computer-based components will do pc
builds benchmarks all the good stuff
pretty much whatever you want to see on
the channel we can make happen yeah we
pretty much both of us have kind of been
doing similar content around like the
480 and talking about a lot of the same
topics so that's kind of how we came
together I was like let's get together
and do a video and kind of discuss
what's going on right now at the 1060
because it's pretty pretty exciting
right now this whole mid-range market
which usually doesn't get as much
attention as we're seeing right now and
that's thanks I think in part to the RX
480 here just being at that $200 sweet
spot if you're going for the a gig 239 I
think MSRP it's just it's it's I think
the sweet spot in terms of the FPS per
dollar and that's kind of been that way
around 200 or 300 bucks and so now we're
seeing video play follow suit in that
and that's pretty interesting because it
seems like both of these cards are going
to be very competitive yeah AMD
basically came out and just like we're
not even going after the high end right
now we're going to let you just have
that one for now and video we're just
going to go we're going right after the
two hundred fifty dollar price point
because we see that that's where the
majority of gamers are at under that 300
our price point so they've just went out
went straight after that and now just a
couple of weeks later we see nvidia come
back with a counter punch with the gtx
1060 at $249 which is like right there
yeah they did let it last long did that
Amy hey Andy fan raid was was there for
about two weeks and you know they were a
bit of a bit of controversy involved
with the car and the power issues and
all that but that seems to be a very
isolated issue and on top of that I I
think it's interesting that may be
decided to do it this way that decided
to release their mid range card first if
you look in the past most of the time
it's the top end card that gets released
upfront and then you know slowly but
surely the lower end cards kind of
trickle their way down but Amy's
changing it up a bit and
uh nvidia didn't let it last for too
long from what it seems so so we just
got that price announcement yesterday
for the two hundred and forty nine
dollars which is MSRP on the GTX 1060
but the 480 we've already seen those out
in the wild going for two hundred and
forty dollars which was above the 199
for the four gigabyte cards you know
besides that whole the vram gate if you
want even call it that but not having
the four gigabytes actually yeah and the
power issues now which have been reposed
Lee resolved with the the new driver
update did you try that by the way and I
haven't yet honestly I haven't even put
it in since I built that cheap computer
and then I did the SLI thing with
DirectX 12 I need to do it though
because yeah yeah a lot of people were
pretty tense about that in the video
that I where I talked about that so it
would be interesting to see if that is
resolved with just a software she
because doesn't seem like it's
software-based it doesn't seem like just
a simple change in code will fix that
issue seems more hardware based so I
meet you see if it works out yeah if you
can if you can recreate it like you know
10 times out of 10 you know with your
with that build with with the current
dry it with the older driver and then
just go ahead and do nothing but update
the driver and see if it fixes and
she'll be really good to see that I
think I might just do that like without
even editing anything I'll just
completely film it as is that way people
know not trying to tamper with anything
and then just simply update the driver
and see if the problem persists that
I'll be interesting yeah so um on the
price though it's coming out at well 249
MSRP and then they're saying the
founders edition again we're having to
get stuck with the nvidia tax of three
hundred dollars for their founders card
which i think is ridiculous you know
does it really make this a two hundred
fifty dollar card knowing what we saw
with the 1080 in the 1070 is you know
those were MSRP you know 599 in the 1080
show me a 599 1080 yeah and especially
with the with the the type of card it is
i mean it's a beautiful card on me wrong
but the overclock ability with those
cards you can get it to where you want
it to be but at the expense of very high
core temperatures and that's not
something that's very desirable
especially with the new pascal
technology you know you don't want to be
trading off that new very thermal
efficient technology for the sake of
having a very overclockable card and
also like you said at a higher price
point to
oxymoron 'ok in its own right yeah the
higher price point is really what makes
absolutely no sense but as far as it
just being you know a reference card and
the thermals i didn't have any
limitations i felt on my 1080 with how
far i was able to push it with the core
clock because of temperatures once i did
set a custom fan curve whereas on my rx
480 that I tested I absolutely did feel
limited on the reference design it left
me wanting more with the custom board
from someone like msi or asus SAP fire
whoever to see you know how proper
cooling can really keep that down
because my card was hitting 90 degrees
if I didn't adjust the fan curve and it
was definitely limiting it mine wouldn't
even let me get to what you see here was
13 50 megahertz 13 50 megahertz with
that was the fifty percent power
increasing all that okay see my wouldn't
even do that looks like you had a better
than car than I did but I would get to
1350 and I'd pretty much pushed the the
voltage as high as I safely could go and
it was not letting me do I think 1330
was where I ended up leaving mine for
the most part yeah not good to see too
much difference there between you know
1338 since 20 megahertz yeah yeah so
I've got up a benchmark right here from
the GTX 1060 know this was a leaked
benchmark originally from X faster they
had posted a fire strike benchmark on
normal and then the RX for any numbers
that i have here are my own numbers on
my own testing from the stock and my
overclock with 13 50 megahertz so you
can kind of see on there that the 1060
was coming in right behind that 480
overclocked and i also did my own
guesstimation therefore the 1060 is
where i think it might be able to hit
give it a 15-percent overclock that's
just a 15-percent adjustment to the
stocks score that we saw there so I that
seems you know where I usually expect to
see an overclock yeah that seems that
seems fair from my perspective as well I
mean look at the 10 70s and 1080s how
much of a frame rate gain we saw with
just a moderate overclock on both of
those cards that to me that that falls
in line before we were already seeing
now a lot of people like to you know say
that you know fire strike it's it's not
real it's not real world performance but
what I like about it is I do think it is
a good apples to apples kind of like GPU
ranking to kind of just find out where
the core performances on the x11 anyway
it's essentially a heaven benchmark i
would say without the frame rates
it's it's still it's still pushing the
GPUs to their limits but it's it's it's
gay I guess it's gauging the performance
in a different way it's not basing it on
frame rates it's basing it on an overall
score which i think is derived from
frame rates anyway if i'm not mistaken
so the end results really the same i
would say yeah and and with those custom
coolers coming we saw had seen some
rumors already that the custom coolers
on the four 80s with overclocks and even
water they were talking about getting up
like 1.5 gigahertz on water yeah so this
was only a 1350 so how much further is
that yellow bar going to move over to
the right once we get custom coolers on
there exactly yeah and you know the ten
60s are gonna be great overclockers to
begin with so yeah we go with those
custom coolers on there I think in with
respect to both brands both cards I
think that it's going to be pretty close
at least from what we're seeing so far
both of these cards have good
overclocking potential these from what
it looks like for the 480 when it comes
to custom coolers and we've seen we have
some pictures of custom our X 480
coolers and they look pretty awesome
they look very effective as well yeah
we've seen some of them so far we got
some appear firm from power color with
their devil cards which usually like
just the ridiculous overclocker cards
they usually have my custom custom bios
and cooling custom PCBs everything on
those cards we got one from gigabyte and
msi as well SAP fire so there's a lot of
custom boards coming out and I think
that's really what we're going to need
to see to get the full picture of the RX
480 and see what it can hit yeah and
that's what a lot of people are saying
just in comments on my videos alone you
know it's difficult to gauge the
performance of a card based on its stock
cooler its reference cooler and so
that's that's why we're looking forward
to this stuff for the most part just
because then we'll see really how far
these things can be pushed because most
people are going to just purchase these
cards and they're gonna throw them into
their rigs some of us will overclock try
to push them a little further but for
the most part what you get is what you
put in your iggin what you play with so
these out of the box overclocks for both
of these cards should should breaking
things up quite a bit in terms of the
graphs we were just looking at yeah and
just you know even if the cards you know
coming it like to 250 to 300 dollars
here on the 1060 their tap they're
saying it's you know going to be like
980 level performance which is pretty
close that's this is it's pretty close
fairly accurate I think
the 1060 is kind of looking like a
heavily overclocked 970 or a stock 980
maybe yeah and we have the the graph
that you had right the the fire strike
one what's the one that has the 10 970
graphs on it oh yeah I've got yeah we've
got that up here so yeah this is um this
is kind of showing some graphs I all
wound up overlaying this year because
it's really hard to see for people but
um yeah this is kind of like this is
basically all the benchmarks that I did
in my review of the 480 versus the 970
which you can see it's it's weird it's
really close the game is where the 480
pulls ahead by a lot is really the DX 12
titles that's otherwise it's usually
very neck and neck with the 970 winning
in some games yep and this looks to be
in line with what we're expecting from
Nvidia's 1060 as well if they say it's
on par with the 980 we're going to
assume that's a that's kind of like a
stock 980 they're not going to compare
it to an overclocked 90 because that
would be that would just do themselves a
disservice so if we say stock 90 we know
that overclocked is severely overclocked
9 70s will approach 980 territory so if
that's if that's true what they're
saying then it looks like the 1060 will
be very close to the RX 480 with these
games here that you've already tested
yeah I'm like I'm like I was mentioning
the ones weren't really pulled ahead
I'll buy a lot more was dx12 and that's
that's the future that's the future is
DX 12 we just saw today that there was a
patch brought in for rise of the Tomb
Raider where they added in 8th layer it
already had the X 12 but now they've
added in a sink compute support so in
that type of testing you should expect
to see AMD cards pull ahead and that's
because they actually have it at the
hardware line exactly hardware basis
singer's compute and that's it's
interesting at we were talking this
earlier the the tomb raider that game
was bundled with the 970 and I think the
960 maybe a few other nvidia graphics
cards in the past but it's nice to see
the developers not being I guess biased
in that way because we do now it's
pretty obvious at this point asynchrony
favors AMD and it's because it's on the
hardware level so it is good to see that
they're extending that Direct X 12
support that is this is the way the
future folks they mean these games are
only going to be DirectX 12 based in the
near future so it's good to see that
they're starting to add these two games
that have already been released on both
directx 11 and 12 platforms you know I
don't really know how far back
you know hardware level async compute
goes for AMD but someone had raised an
interesting question to me yesterday was
if do you think that this is maybe
because they have already been
supporting mantle from the beginning
whereas nvidia they didn't do that and
so maybe they're kind of playing catch
up on that sort of with low-level api's
that could be the k I mean look at the
290 that the 290x was was outperforming
that 980 TI in directx 12 titles I mean
we this goes back five six years and
this was before DirectX 12 was even
thought of being put into games like
this so it goes back quite a ways we're
looking at Hawaii GPUs for the 290 and
the 3 90 x and all those so it looks it
looks rather daunting for NVIDIA at this
point unless they say they can fix this
issue with software again this is kind
of similar to the power issue with the
RX 480 the pci power draw issue they're
saying that these things can be fixed
with software but software only goes so
far you can't change it actual
components on PCBs with software so you
know I'm not sure if I'm not a print
expert in asynchronous compute but I
don't believe yeah but I don't believe
that it's going to be strictly software
fix fixable I guess what I'm trying to
say no they've they basically kind of
been able to just put up like a patch
it's just like it's like a band-aid for
their cards so that so that they can
actually run these games and have them
look look the same because there was
even with the I remember with the GTX
1080 there was that press driver that
they had showed against the arts for a
teasing cross fire and the games
actually looked different and it's
because it was being handled differently
in the driver by Nvidia it's that since
then been been fixed and it should be at
least looking relatively the same but
the way that these cards actually handle
it is completely differently it's apples
and oranges and you know when you can
actually see the difference in the in
gameplay you know that there's there's
there's just a such a wide divided right
now currently with the two technologies
and and hopefully nvidia can start
feeling in that gap when it comes to a
sinker computing right x 12 anyway
because i may be clearly has a lead in
in directx 12 so we'll see where it goes
hopefully hopefully the the high antenna
tease 1070 cards can can catch up via
software but i have my own personal
doubts about that claim it just doesn't
add up to me so give given the
information we have right now and if we
were to you know kind of speculate with
the aftermarket cards if the the 480 and
the you know the 1060 end up being
really really close with aftermarket
cards and overclocking all things
considered you know where where would
you want to go with one of those cards
would you want to go with the 480 it
let's say even if it's slightly behind
mmm would it be worth it because of dx12
coming in the future yeah it depends I
would have to look specifically at
Direct X 12 titles and how big of a lead
the arcs 40 has over the 1060 in that
regard or in those regards I personally
I'm a fan of nvidia software I love and
video software shadow plays great i love
their GeForce experience yeah I it just
I guess it's just going to come down to
preference personally I think I would
still go with the 1060 just because of
the software but again if you're
somebody who doesn't use shadow play
very much I use that to record all of my
on-screen activity by the way and oh
yeah it's just easy you just pull it up
and you can control or all nine whatever
and you start recording video on your on
your screen you can't do that with AMD
they don't have the ability to basically
screen capture straight from the card
you have to use third-party software for
that so that's an extra added cost but
again if you're not into that stuff if
you just play video games honestly dr x
480 is is in my opinion more future
proof just based on what we've seen so
far with its ability to perform well in
Direct X 12 yeah I actually I kind of
hate myself for like basically a hundred
percent agreeing with you on the
software side of things as I feel I feel
like people going to come after that all
these but you know your fanboys because
really it really is really do I don't
know what to tell you guys like I've
used I've used both sides i've used
nvidia control panel I've used Crimson
I've used all that stuff personally I
enjoy my user experience within the
nvidia drivers more yeah I mean being
labeled a fanboy is just something that
seems to be going around a lot on
YouTube and it's just I guess a
retaliation to well you don't agree with
me so therefore you must be a fanboy
when it comes to video cards at least or
maybe even see peers when zens release
that should be interesting but for the
most part it is entirely subjective so
whether or not you enjoy crimson drivers
and crimson software or you enjoy the
GeForce experience it's just
preferential there's nothing wrong with
Fay
bring one or the other and if we're both
openly we're open about it we don't know
hiding it but that doesn't make us
necessarily fanboys I mean if that's
what makes this a fanboy fanboys I guess
I guess it's what we are because I I've
said the same time again is I do not
care what the brand is on the side of
the card I really don't it's just gonna
be what I want yeah it has to it has to
cater to my needs as a user and exactly
if I'm putting a situation where AMD and
NVIDIA are just neck-and-neck side by
side personally I'm going to choose
nvidia because well right now I've got
it I've got g-sync monitors so I feel I
do feel kind of locked in as a result of
that and then also I prefer their
software and shadow play is great i can
record my games with almost no
performance impact exactly yep yeah
that's that's kind of the state of s
that's my state of mind currently our x
480 does look to be a very compelling
choice right now I don't I would never
fault you for purchasing it or do we do
our car that performs around the 980
performance but at the same time if
you're somebody who does a lot of screen
recording or you just you tinker a lot
with the nvidia software and that's what
you enjoy doing more than the crimson
side of things with AMD I don't know the
gaming evolved I guess that's the
software they use for them and plays TV
you know it just it just depends I like
the refined clean cut look of the
GeForce experience but you may not and I
might be a fanboy for liking that but so
be it i suppose i know i agree with you
i think i think for creators it can be a
little bit more useful to have nvidia
but recommending cards for Pete like
consumers out there that are just just
straight wanting to wanting to wanting
to buy cards and wanting to puge
future-proof and are concerned about
DirectX 12 then exactly the 480 may be
the better way to go now this is just
remember though this is based on
speculation we don't even have a 1060
yet here to test so this is just us
talking about you know what's coming in
the future and exactly you know and we
already know that the 4 80's while I
wouldn't recommend anyone by 24 80s
versus a higher power card they do
Supercross fire but on the 1060 side
we've actually seen some interesting
from the images they've got no ass alive
fingers on there so people are saying
you know no sli support which is very
interesting to see nvidia hasn't yet
said if the SLI bridge will be removed
and everything will be transferred to
the PCIe slot it's
I mean from what it looks like they're
not going to have an SLI bridge and
they're kind of leaving us hanging at
this point will the 1060 support sli
kind of up in the air yeah we've seen
things in the past about Envy link but I
highly doubt that they would introduce
that here at the lower end card on
something like the GTX 1060 they would
have done on a 1080 if they're yeah yeah
that would have it would have been it
would have been big if they did that and
they would have played that up huge they
wouldn't have done it with this you know
silent almost paper launcher of the GTX
1060 exactly that's kind of thing I
wanted to bring up is because they have
they've had a lot of supply issues with
the 1080 in 1070 the prices have been
astronomical oh yeah as a result of
their their paper launch do you view
what that what's happening right now
with the 1060 as a paper watch because I
personally do yeah of course I think the
1060 appeals to a wider audience the
people who purchase the 10 seventies and
the 10 80s are going to be your more
hardcore gamers or people who game in
1440p or 4k who have those monitors
already and want to enjoy the experience
in those higher resolutions but for the
most part I think it's safe to say the
1060 will appear appeal tense but for
the most part I think it will be safe to
say that the 1060 will appeal to a much
wider audience and that does beckon the
concerns of availability prices price
hikes I mean think about it when you
when you choke the supply demand is way
up here and you don't have enough cards
the prices are going to be very high for
the cards that are available what little
they will have yeah and on the on the
topic of maybe not having enough ten 60s
available at launch i just went really
quickly a quote an article over on an
insect where they were talking about the
1060 yesterday they said in practice
nvidia has been receiving / processing
GP 106 for months so the formal launch
of the gtx 1060 doesn't change anything
but nonetheless hints that nvidia is
struggling at some point in their supply
chain to meet demand so based on that it
sounds like they may struggle with this
car just as much as they did with 1070
and 1080 and you know i had kind of
thought maybe that that was because of
ddr 5x on the 1080 but it's been
trickling down into the 1070 also yep I
mean look the company right underneath
that sentence you just finished up
reading officially the company is stated
they expect broad availability of the
card and that they are ramping up supply
really fast quote on quote but it's
definitely a case where
have to wait and see and and that that's
kind of the same thing that they were
saying about the 1070 tending obviously
both of those cards had a lot of
exposure before you could actually
purchase them except for the those who
had review samples already so a lot of
that was kind of building up underneath
and then they said oh we have ten sevens
available now and then they were all
gone within like the first five minutes
on every website trust me i was up at
midnight checking they were all gone
within the first five minutes so you
know I expected 1062 be to be much of
the same if not worse personally just
because I think people can afford them
exactly they're gonna want this car
because it's cheaper and you're getting
1080 excuse me 980 performance out of it
if you that looks like as good a bargain
up a better bargain than the RX 480 at
this point yeah it just it very well may
be um maybe not necessarily on the
founders ition at three hundred dollars
but if you can actually find cards at
that $249 price point that is very
attractive it um you know if if it comes
out and you know it's around three
hundred dollars and it's you know maybe
ten percent faster but it's costing like
twenty-five percent more than you may
have to start thinking about it or if
it's worth it to you in your budget you
know yeah and that's that just comes
down to 22 preference what I will say is
that and I talked about this in one of
my videos if you're if you're looking
for one of these clothes so you're
looking for ten sixty it's it's been
released once a really stay for the ten
sixty by the way I should note July 19th
July 19 so let's say it's July twentieth
and your online looking for a ten sixty
you can't find one anywhere newegg
amazon wherever else you're looking
inside yeah I think that's a foregone
conclusion at this point on the 20 if
there won't be any tents there won't be
a delicious there's not gonna be it's a
definite thing this why there's not
gonna be any ten 60s available so you're
I guess second instinct might be to
check ebay do not spend five hundred
dollars which 2060 it's it's so yeah
just just wait I mean yeah you want a
card up front unless you don't have a
graphics card and you really need to do
something up front and I guess in that
sense you you you're all by all means I
mean it's your money but I would never
personally spend four to five hundred
bucks on a card like that and you could
buy a gtx 1074 cheaper than that right
now and they are starting to creep back
into stock right now so that's something
to consider and plus once this comes out
and we see the performance you're going
to see the price of those other cards
like the 90s and
seven to use pricing is just going to
drop exactly when you when you go to
ebay and you're looking at those ten 60s
for five hundred dollars just do another
search for the gtx 980 his head and
you'll find you'll find it like probably
more than less than half the price of
that yeah it's not I mean it's not as
relevant now but I've released a video
about the 90 DTI them in the gold
edition from MSI which is a five hundred
and fifty dollar card was going for four
hundred twenty bucks yeah and that's
something that I recommended at that
point in time because the 1070 was not
available you couldn't find it anywhere
i was checking day in and day out
couldn't fly in the card so i said screw
it i want to buy a 980 TI because uh
well they're available and they're super
cheap and as i showed in one of the
benchmarking videos they're pretty much
the same in terms of performance and
overclock ability so I mean consider
that like I said look at the 1980s look
at the nine 70s even you can get an
overclocked 970 of the perform on par
with some of the nine 80s out there so
you know look at those before you spend
500 bucks on something that that is not
worth that price at all yep yeah so I'll
be curious to see these reviews I've
heard some rumors that we should be
seeing review sometime around maybe like
the 14th or the 15th so that's a little
a little bit ahead of when the cards are
coming out on the 19th so definitely
we'll keep our eyes out for that but I
think we're going to go ahead and wrap
up and get out of here now yes if you

the description below as well as i'm
