uploaded this shot basically on Twitter
and said something about cable
management do you prioritize it and
someone on the social media platform
became very upset I don't know if he was
just having a bad day I'm not gonna call
him out by name or you know I don't want
you guys going there harassing or
anything like that but he was very
standoffish up front about how you know
this thing didn't exist right this this
whole clear transparent panel even on
the left side he was talking about how
pcs used to be completely enclosed where
you couldn't see on the inside and I
made a comment and when I uploaded the
picture about how pcs are a form of art
at least for me and and I would hope
that other people when they build
comparable systems would take the time
to make these look nice I didn't say it
was a requirement obviously if you've
built every week maybe you just want to
get them out of the way
you know then making things look very
artsy isn't a priority but I was just
really surprised that this person was so
upset by the new trend in PC so I can't
want to talk about that in this video
now just so you guys get an idea of what
goes on pretty much every day here this
is the sexually an old mattress box this
has all of my custom loop gear in it you
know it fittings radiators CPU blocks
graphics card blocks reservoirs all
that's in this box I should have more of
it in the other room
all my fittings are there some of them
anyway and then we have a couple like
you know 90 degree fittings and stuff in
this bag I try to keep things semi
sorted so I know where I'm going and
where to look for things I have that
course PC I'm working on right now
you'll see the other side of that in a
second air cooler from an old build I
just tore down
that's the Thermaltake view 37 I
reviewed earlier had a building that I
took that build out this is the deep
cool case today built in and reviewed a
few weeks ago the building there is
coming out as well
this is our roughly five six hundred
dollar build I was using you know I was
hooking up a time monitor and running
things that it's not an official setup
or anything you can see I'm fairly
organized over here right so I have all
of my graphics cards and motherboards up
you can see I don't have many graphics
cards I've what do I have here have a
1070 I have a 1070 TI a 1080 TI and then
a 570 and then a 760 I mean look I
bought these three by myself right so no
one no one sent me these three this one
I got from EVGA
this one I got from gigabyte this isn't
even a
car this is just a water block so I you
know I don't have it like a graphics
card supplier it'd be nice if I had one
but I really don't and I kind of have to
rely on my own you know business budget
to get a lot of these things now
motherboards I can pretty much get those
you know at will but you know you can
only do so much with a board you also
have to have the CPU to go inside of it
so I try to keep things fairly organized
in the film room now the office is
almost always clean this was much worse
about shoot on 10 15 minutes ago I had
to builds in here that I was taking
apart this was my own personal build in
the fractal define r6 this has now been
torn down to just the motherboard and
cables and power supply I'm still in the
process of taking those things out you
see a couple of the tubes that I bent
from the custom loop are still on the
ground I was pretty much doing
everything on top of these little
cubbies and I have a CPU cooler over
there for I don't even I don't even know
what reason there's a 7900 X CPU just
laying casually on the on the desk there
so the kitchen is where I disassemble
all of my custom loop gear you can see I
was doing dishes as well this is the
pump the tubing the CPU block we have
the graphics card here one of the two
1080s
this reservoir from thermal tech check
this out this is sorry about how loud
that is this is pretty gross I don't
know if you can really see it's gonna be
this yeah that's gonna be difficult to
tell on camera but anyway this reservoir
has a bit of a green tint to it it's
actually a thick film on the inside from
the fluid so I posted a pic to Twitter a
while ago showing that the fluid that
I'd originally put in my r6 build was
purple and then it slowly turned green
which i think means is something either
in the radiator or in the fluid itself
was anodizing which is not good it means
that it's out of picking up the metal
and carrying it with it or its oxidizing
right and that'll turn metals certain
colors so interesting that it's green I
don't think it's copper though because
these aluminum rads are just that
they're aluminum it doesn't really make
sense and everything else is
nickel-plated so unless it ate through
the nickel which I highly doubt then
something in these rads was yeah
causing some weird issues with the fluid
so I wanted to show you all of this to
really give you an idea of the the kind
of time that it takes to build and
teardown and build again these pcs I
don't do this because it's a part of my
job in fact I could probably build one
PC a month and still have successful
channel just because I feel like our
channel in particular is more like an
informative Channel so if I shifted to
just that I would do it
I just don't like to learn all the time
you're probably Wow
Greg actually said dead on camera but
it's true I really don't you know I get
it just gets boring after a while I like
building pcs that's where my free time
goes and that's why I'm always tweaking
things I'm always you know if I'm
changing one or two things in a build
I'll be happy to do it because it's just
another form of art for me it's like
painting on a totally blank canvas and
just getting to be as creative as you
want within your budget and that's why I
have so many bills just laying around
all over the place because I want to see
what looks good with what works well
with what you know from an experimental
standpoint not just how good things look
but how well they run together and
that's why I'm always experimenting and
trying new things with just a you know
minor changes in the build itself and
that's where custom loops come in this
is one I'm currently working on to see
more details in this in a dedicated
video but this is basically like the
pinnacle for a custom PC builder here if
you can build a custom loop preferably
with with rigid tubing if it requires
more work and my opinion looks a little
better then you have reached like
nirvana when it comes to building pcs
because you can be as creative as you
possibly want you can have Ben's go any
which direction be as creative with your
with your flow direction and with your
components as you want again within your
budget and it's just it's a blast it
really is custom loop building is
expensive all the parts are extremely
expensive but is it worth it
maybe not from a performance standpoint
but I would argue if you really value
your work and you value being creative
and just being different having a PC it
looks different from every other PC out
there then custom loop building is for
you and that's why when this person
openly disagreed with me on Twitter in
response to a tweet that really wasn't
offensive at all I was just you know
asking do you value cable management or
do you not you know why
winces someone else was like well I
build a lot of PC's and so I you know
I'm always taking them apart I don't
value it very much that makes perfect
sense if you just don't care about it
maybe you do have a completely closed
off left and right side panel then
you're not really gonna care about it
much hi there right at least to the
extent that it doesn't impede with your
airflow but if you're going to you know
publicly tell me that I shouldn't be
able to do something because it's just
not the way it was back in the 90s and
the early 2000s then I'm going to
publicly disagree with you I quoted his
tweet and I said look dude there's
nothing wrong with me using PC's to
express myself they are my they're my
canvases they're that it's my form of
art and I don't want anyone else telling
me what I can and can't do when I
express myself on a blank slate like
that
he ended up deleting his tweet a lot of
people jump to my defense which I
appreciate it on Twitter but he I guess
felt the need to delete it I don't
really see the point of that right
you're gonna publicly disagree don't
back down off your public disagreement
by deleting it everyone's gonna know
that you either regret it or just don't
feel the need to defend yourself any
longer but with that aside I am still
glad that this came up because it leads
me to the conclusion of this very short
video no one's gonna have the same
opinion you're not gonna find any two
people on earth who have the exact same
opinions on every single topic out there
especially when it comes to something
like politics right any kind of
political argument is bound to have some
form of disagreement
so with PCs it's kind of the same right
you can at least appreciate the artwork
without saying that you would do
something or paint something or create
something that looks exactly the same we
all want to be unique in our own ways
and there's nothing wrong with it
doesn't mean that I'm an entitled
millennial because I want to be
different that doesn't mean that you
know I was automatically born around the
year 2000 that's ridiculous you can
label entire groups of people you know
by what you see on the news and what you
see on online but when it comes down to
it you are unique and if you strive to
be unique you will you will be seen as
such by your colleagues by your friends
or by people who just watch your videos
if you take the time to do something
different people will stop and
appreciate it maybe not everybody but
those aren't the people you're doing it
for you're doing it for the people who
do appreciate your work you know when
you're willing to just destroy three
rooms of your house or apartment to
build something like this because I had
to take parts from other builds that
we're already being used that's why the
role
horn down then you know the people who
appreciate that kind of work ethic are
the ones you want sticking around you
don't want the people who are willing to
bash you because you chose a case that
has a transparent right side panel he
even went on to say that desktops
shouldn't even be put on top of desks I
mean in that why they're called desktops
so don't want to call this a rant I just
wanted to state my case I want you guys
to know why I do what I do why I enjoy
making videos for all of you and why I
don't just post informative content that
doesn't involve creativity to some
extent because this is what I truly love
doing and look my custom loop builds on
YouTube really don't get the exposure
that I would like most of the time they
get 20,000 views or so and that's really
small in comparison to the number of
subscribers we have on this channel so
active views on those videos pretty low
but I still do them anyway because those
who do watch appreciate at least the
work ethic and the you know the
craftsmanship that goes into building
something like this I can't wait by the
way to start bending tubes for this one
I don't know how I'm gonna run these
runs run these runs wow that really came
out well but I am still excited for the
end result I always say I'm with these
because I don't actually picture it all
on my head before I start I don't know
what it's gonna look like I don't know
what fluid I'm gonna use yet maybe white
I'm using white fittings so I'm sinking
like an opaque white again with black
components should be a nice contrast
we'll see how it goes but stay tuned for
that video for now I want to know what
you guys think in the comments below is
your PC or are your PC's if you have
multiple pcs out there maybe you've
built multiples in the past are they
forms of art for you do you really care
how they look or you just the kind of
person who keeps them on the ground and
doesn't really bother with them you have
an ITX PC a full-size Tower do you have
a transparent left and or right side
panel I'd be weird if you only had a
right side panel it's transparent but do
you have something like that do you like
to express yourself that's what I want
to know from all of you guys in the
comments below if you do like creativity
goes when a thumbs up I appreciate it
thumbs down for the obstacle a subscribe
button if you have everything stay tuned
for some informative topics here on the
channel this is science studio thanks
for learning with us
