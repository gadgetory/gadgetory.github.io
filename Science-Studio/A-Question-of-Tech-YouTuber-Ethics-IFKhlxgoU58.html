the time to a first off use the green
screen for the first time in an official
video which think it's pretty cool also
answer a very important question that a
fellow follower on Twitter had mr. Jeff
Murray he kind of called them to
question our ethical standards and also
other tech tubers that he watches a bit
confused as to you know what dictates an
ad whether or not we're getting paid for
reviews or just add spots kind of where
the gray lines are and how we
particularly handle things like that so
I'm gonna talk in this video about our
ethical stand points kind of how we do
things here and for the sake of other
tech tubers out there kind of speak on
some of their behalf because I know that
some of them do things a certain way but
I would encourage all of them all the
major guys out there all the big league
players to either create a dedicated
video like this one or answer these
questions on their social media
platforms to help appease the concerns
of their viewers so first I'm going to
read Geoff's for tweets again an idea of
where he's coming from you're not going
to believe the timing on this but I just
now opened a tab to look at my Twitter
feed to make a comment about something
related to this one don't worry about
the post he's talking about I've been
noticing in the past three to six months
that all of my favorite YouTube tech
channels are doing many and in some
cases a majority of their content being
paid or non paid advertising for
products under the umbrella of reviews
or outright promotional ads this trend
is really worrisome to me I initially
sub to these channels for the pure
education that they were teaching me and
now I don't feel as if I'm being taught
anything anymore but rather being sold a
product or service under the guise of
Education I am thinking of what I should
do with my feelings in this considering
the reasons I sub to these tech channels
in the first place are my thoughts out
of place here are you in disagreement
with my sentiments on where things like
this have been heading of late or is
this becoming the new norm for YouTube
channels to keep a revenue stream coming
in just to make a living so I want to
start off by saying that under no
circumstance should any person or
business sacrifice his or her or its
ethics for the sake of making a living
that's basically saying that it's okay
to take money for the sake of
compromising what you deem as a right
and wrong another point that Jeff brings
up is that he thinks that some tech
tubers are being paid to review products
now that just kind of like in a
black-and-white sense is wrong I will
take a stand on that right now being
paid by a company to review a product is
just shady at best and the reason why I
think that is because if you want more
money from a company you're gonna keep
saying good things about their products
right they're gonna keep one and send
you things as long as you say good
things about them and the moment that
you say something wrong they're gonna
cut that funding totally get that but
what if a company wanted to pay for
shelf space that is the opportunity for
the tech tuber to review the product
what they're saying is essentially hey
look you have you know tons of companies
wanting you to review their products so
we're gonna pay you I don't know
thousand bucks to put our product at the
top of your list so you can make that
video next there's still the issue of
being paid for a review live I mean no
matter how you look at it no matter how
unbiased you think you are you love the
fact that a company is giving you cash
essentially to review their product
doesn't matter what the intention of the
payment was you're attributing that
review to the money you received and
that is a huge ethical issue in my book
I will admit I was on the fence about
this at one point until a few of the
bigger tech tubers out there I know Jay
for one really stuck his neck on I
appreciate him for doing that made a
very clear point that receiving money at
all for any type of review is a bad idea
even if you trust yourself if you trust
you know your neutrality in a review the
fact is if anyone even finds out that
you're getting paid to review a product
it isn't gonna end very well so that is
why it will never happen on this channel
I will never receive money for a product
review or product review consideration
now the company is paying money for hey
promote this product that's totally
different
that is called an advertisement okay
they are paying for the promotion
they're paying for you to say good
things about the product I'm about to do
a video for Intel on obtain that is a
paid video it's a paid sponsorship they
want me to say good things about it I'm
gonna inform the audience of what octane
does but I'm also not going to say
anything negative about it because it is
an advertisement and I will be sure to
let everyone know as such right at the
beginning of that video all tech tubers
should and usually do this so there's
the difference between a paid review and
a sponsored video one is wrong in my
book and one is ok as long as the
audience is alright with it I mean they
don't want to watch an advertisement
they'll just click away to something
else they're not losing anything they're
not being mislead I'm not gonna say
anything
inaccurate in the sponsored video but
I'm not going to take the time to point
out some flaws now there's a third
concern I want to bring up regarding
Jeff's tweets and that has to do with
paid promotional spots usually at the
beginnings of videos it lasts about 15
seconds or so where they say hey check
out so-and-so's product we want you to
you know click on the link in the video
description and purchase a product blah
blah blah maybe get a discount code or
something to kind of stimulate that
purchase right they want the buyer to
click the link and then they want the
buyer to click the Buy button once they
click on that link in the description
it's a call to action it's what an ad is
supposed to be it's how it drives sales
so a company comes to let's say they
come to me and they say hey we want to
pay you a hundred bucks to insert this
ad for this case if the case cost ten
dollars they're banking on me being able
to sell about ten cases at least but
then they get a return on their
investment and for me to have a decent
paycheck to go home with I don't lose
anything in the long run just a few
minutes of filming b-roll they don't
lose anything in the long run as long as
they make sales and the customer the
viewer usually doesn't lose anything
either because it's like what 15 seconds
ok just fast-forward if you don't want
to watch the ad the ethical question
though is whether or not it's okay to
promote a product with which you have no
experience I try my best to not promote
products and advertisements and just
full-on dedicated videos that I'm not
familiar with because if the product
ends up sucking and a bunch of my
viewers end up clicking and buying the
product and finding out that it doesn't
fact suck they're gonna come back to me
and say hey Greg what if you promote
such a crap product and then from then
on out they might not trust my reviews
or my opinions on other products because
I'm just ill informed right so this is
more or less a question of integrity not
necessarily ethics although they do both
go hand in hand obviously so if I
promote a product that sucks people
aren't going to trust my opinion anymore
when it comes to any other product my
viewership will go down I might lose
subs in the process and then I really
get hit hard in the long run so there's
kind of an incentive there to not
promote a product that sucks but some
people will do it anyway because hey fat
paychecks right so I want to thank Jeff
for the tweets I'm grateful that he you
know had the courage to ask that
question and he asked it in the right
way he didn't ask it a snarky way and
kind of like trying to demean tech
tubers and stuff because then I just
don't give you the time of day whatever
I'll ignore it but he asked it in a
genuine fashion and I appreciate him
asking the question I encourage all of
you to check the integrity of the
channels that you watch even hours
especially
hours because if you don't agree with
something or a way of doing something
then you should tell us because we need
to check ourselves change the structure
if it is wrong so that we can keep our
integrity in check this is a science
channel after all most of that stuff is
fairly objective but when it comes to
reviews and being paid for products and
product placements and advertisements I
want to make sure that I'm doing things
the right way and that's where all of
you come into play if you liked this
video be sure to give it a thumbs up
thumbs down for the opposite click that
subscribe button if you haven't already
and stay tuned for more videos like this
this is science studio thanks for asking
