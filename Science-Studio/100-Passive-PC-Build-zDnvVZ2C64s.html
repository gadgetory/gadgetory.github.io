Silverstone watched our first attempt at
building a family system with stuff we
had on hand and they yeah this wasn't
very good you're sick of seeing the same
activation watermark with your shiny new
rig snaggin OEM Windows 10 Pro key from
SC D key even if you've already
installed Windows 10 on your machine you
can show out a little over ten bucks for
an authentic key that'll activate your
copy click the link below and use offer
code s studio for an 18 percent discount
on your order so they sent us a bunch of
stuff actually more stuff than they had
already sent us several months ago to
help us with our fanless PC endeavor and
I'm proud to say that we've totally
shifted gears now taking a lot of
suggestions from you guys in the
comments after watching our first
attempt we're switching the platform
altogether while technically
staying with the same platform to
switching our approach with that
platform so this is a 2400 G and this
means we're not going to need a discrete
GPU that was our issue before was
getting a graphics card that wasn't
meant to run passive to run passive and
it ultimately didn't end up working so
what we're going to do is dump it all
together now I could go with some
passive 1050 Ti I mentioned that any
other video there are cards that are
meant to run passive and maybe someday
I'll get my hands on some of those I'll
have to buy them though and I don't
think they make them anymore so I'll
have to look for some on eBay or Amazon
I will get my hands on one very soon
stay tuned for that now but for now
we're gonna create a passive system that
will actually run and play some decent
games in 1080p maybe medium to low
settings not expecting the world out of
this 2400 G but it should still be what
is this no no the TP is here there's our
TDP on the box I'm not seeing it yeah I
don't think so anyway fork or a thread
it boosts to 3.9 gigahertz and we do
have Vega graphics integrated so we
should be able to cool it with a decent
passive CPU cooler now just using a
cooler that's meant to have a fan
running with it isn't gonna do the job I
don't think you guys were kind of
cringing at that in the last video so
Silverstone said yeah we've got
something for you this brick right here
and it weighs it's gotta weigh at least
three pounds it's friggin beefy
and it's a passive cooler there aren't
any fans that come with this cooler in
the box it just shifts like this and you
can mount fans to it they're actually
little brackets here we can mount those
little wire frame things to get 120mm
fans on here maybe we'll do that
separate video what it would be like to
run a passive cooler with fans maybe
it'll be better than something like an
HD 15 from actual but that's a separate
video for a separate day we're just
gonna see if we can get a passive system
actually working this time and I think
what the components we have on hand now
that will be likely a couple other
things want to point out we are sticking
again with our fanless nightjar NJ 450
power supply a few of you are concerned
about that some of you didn't even watch
the entire video and you're like what
about power supply the power supply is
fanless if you'd watch the video to know
that thanks to those who did watch the
video in its entirety or at least for
the most part you kind of skip around
but I mean this was like this was the
forefront of the build here I mean the
power supply is one of those things that
people tend to overlook when they're
trying to build quiet systems and some
powers place do get fairly loud I have a
couple of each EB jg3 power supplies
they get extremely hot even when they're
not working very hard and so finding a
family's unit like this that's rated 80
plus platinum is difficult and I'm
really glad that Silverstone makes this
the other thing they said makes sense to
a to extra things we have an SFX ATX
power supply adapter you guys didn't see
this in the last video but because this
is an SFX L power supply we were just
kind of letting it sit there inside an
ATX cutout it was connected to the
chassis via one screw this bracket will
allow us to mount it properly so nice
I'm gonna send that also the cabling I
had to use extensions because the cables
in this power supply are not very long
because it's meant to be used in small
small compact cases these are extensions
and they're well they're not even
extensions they're actually it's a full
cable set and you plug this directly
into the modular power supply on one
side and then your components on the
other the cables are just longer so we
won't have that issue either so thanks
to Silverstone for making this much more
possible again I think it's very likely
we'll get a system up and running that
will be totally fanless and
self-sustaining so let's go ahead and
start building now another silver stone
goodie
the FTO 5 from silverstone this is
supposed to be a great case for passive
build so it's gonna allow heat to
passively rise to atmosphere a lot of
cases have kind of a restricted top
panel or maybe the layouts just not
optimal for that kind of thing so we're
gonna use this case I have no idea what
the internals look like I just know that
Silverstone said it would be a good case
so what the heck why not so in a
nutshell what you have here is a midsize
tower that has turned sideways you have
intake fans that are actually placed on
the bottom here and these look huge I
think these are either 180 ml or 200 ml
fans they're much larger than
conventional 120 140 and then those are
supposed to pull in air from the base
there's about an inch worth of clearance
down here there's also sound damping
material on the base as well as the left
and right panels that cold air gets
pulled in from the bottom and it moves
through the components to the graphics
card and the CPU and heat exits up top
and this up here is just a little
plastic grille there's really no dust
filter integrated up top although if
it's a passive system I wouldn't be as
concerned about dust so yeah we're gonna
take out this hard drive bay we don't
need that we're using an MDOT - SSD and
I think we're gonna take the fans out so
that we have unhindered passive air
being pulled in from the bottom as warm
air exits the case from the top when our
CPU gets hot that's what I think's I
think that'll be optimal we'll find out
I mean worst case we got to keep the two
fans in here we just turn them really
low and we do sound tests anyway but for
a totally family system I want to have
these removed and we'll just see how it
goes now my decision to go with this
particular motherboard it's really
simple it's a p450 board it's one of the
only ones I have that's not currently
occupying another system and we get
native APU support so I don't have to
update the BIOS we could in theory do
this with a B 350 for it but we would
have to update the BIOS and ensure that
the motherboard had an HDMI or
DisplayPort out just pop this up double
check for no bent pins just to be on the
safe side drop her in
all right now we're at the bottom of the
case you can see there's this magnetic
dust filter here and these fairly large
fans we're going to remove those and I
think because we're not gonna have any
active cooling down here I think I'm
gonna leave a dust filter off as well
wouldn't be too worried about dust and a
family system although I'm sure it would
become an issue at a much later date
good thing about a fan like this because
it is large it's got to be 180 ml 200
somewhere in that range is that you have
silent operation you can displace the
same amount of air at a much lower rpm
because these fan blades are so friggin
huge so worst case the system gets too
hot without fans in it we just pushed
these two back in to the to the bottom
little bracket here in the case and you
can have these fans pull and cool air
from down below at a very low rpm so if
it's not fanless and if it's not totally
quiet we can get really close with these
that are included in the case
the only sound that this PC makes is
when I power it on little button makes a
little spring noise and that's it
everything else is dead silent in here
there's no inductor coil winding
anything like that the power supply of
course is dead silent CPU cooler is
getting pretty hot I'm waiting for this
to soak and once it soaks then we'll see
how quickly it can passively dissipate
heat and also see if our setup here is
effective enough right pulling cold air
in from the bottom and allowing it to
naturally rise we'll see if that's
effective also we're not stressing the
graphics core the GPU the integrated GPU
at this point just stressing the CPU of
course the side panels off I'm going to
put that on in a second but CPU temps at
the diode are 46 degrees Celsius so
that's about a temperature of this
cooler and it feels about right so yeah
let's just keep pushing it now we're
gonna try to stress literally everything
in the system and then we'll throw a few
games at it like csgo running ashes of
the singularity benchmark and see the
system is stable and makes it through
those runs alright so you can see now
it's been about an hour and seventy
degrees Celsius is pretty much where
these things are topping out is there a
lot of heat coming from this yeah
there's some heat you can feel it just
kind of passively rise and of course
down below we would expect to have cold
air being pulled in passively so look
it's not gonna be you know as effective
as a fan obviously but at least there is
some rotation and circulation of air and
that is why I believe our temps have
leveled off here even though our CPU
cooler has heat soak there's enough
circulation in there to get rid of
enough heat to keep temps from rising
even more which I imagine they would do
if we did something crazy like remove
the CPU cooler entirely so with that
we're gonna run some gaming benchmarks
and then we're gonna try to bump the
frequencies just a bit more and see how
much more thermal Headroom we have to
play with all right so you can see we're
in csgo now about 60 degrees Celsius at
the GPO been playing for about 10
minutes and that temperature has not
really pegged above 60 C not sure why
it's saying we're using 65,000 percent
of our software I wasn't paying
attention GG got killed by a bot 960
megahertz or so for the GPU is pretty
low
significantly lower than stock for the
CPU the 2300 megahertz
across all four cores its yeah not that
great that's why our frame rate is
around a hundred fps a lot of times
though it'll jump above 100 especially
when I'm showing my own gameplay and not
someone elses but yeah this isn't super
great for csgo part of the reason why is
because we've underclock both our GPU
and CPU so what I'm gonna do now now
that we know we have plenty of temp
Headroom is clock these two up - I'm
gonna try 3 gigahertz for the CPU and
then maybe 1100 for the GPU we'll see
how that fares so we're at 3.2 gigahertz
all poor that's not bad for a passive
system it could be better and if I
really just took my time and
troubleshoot it every single setting in
the BIOS I'm sure I can get this a bit
better but right now under bolting the
CPU seems to be doing well for the temps
because if I just left the V chord auto
and kept the frequency the same temps
got into the low 80s so this seems to be
better it's it's not perfect it still
does stutter every now and then but this
is definitely a better playing
experience than the previous test
alright and what we're doing here is
running ashes of the singularity this is
the GPU focused benchmark and look frame
rates aren't that great this is the low
preset in 1080p but it is possible to
play this game with compromises I would
say that the frame rates aren't exactly
terrible for this type of game
I wouldn't want 30fps in a first-person
shooter but for this kind of game it's
ok yeah look just trying out different
games here the whole point is its stable
and if we're willing to make some
compromises you can game on this machine
a 2400 G is not a great substitute for a
discrete card but it will keep up with
something like a gtx 1050 or 1050 TI
alright so here's what I did to get the
system stable and running totally
passive I have a negative 0.125 volt
offset 4v core I also have a negative
point 1 offset for the IGP and the
frequencies for the CPU 30 400 megahertz
across all 4 cores and for the GPU 1040
megahertz when stressing both the C
you FPU cash and GP Unitas 64 engineer
temperatures reached about 78 degrees
Celsius after a 30 minute run and that
remained unchanged for the next 30
minutes so at an hour point they were
basically flatlined which tells me that
the CPU heatsink here this Heligan too
was heat soaked and it was actually able
to dissipate enough heat to keep
temperatures from rising anymore which
is really cool I know I didn't honestly
think this was going to work as well as
it did I thought I'd have to keep clocks
around 2.8 2.9 gigahertz but 3.4
gigahertz is pretty good for a 4 quart
ship like this with nigp with Vega
graphics baked in now I have the sound
meter here there's really nothing to
show you it sounds like ambient because
there's no moving parts in this thing
it is totally silent there's there's no
detectable noise coming from anything
I've even here coil whine and yeah
that's because there are no moving parts
and that is something that I've kind of
always wanted to do I just I didn't
really see it being very practical for
my use cases a lot of this stuff is more
than ish it's not general consumer stuff
fanless tech is it's you know it's just
not as mainstream I guess I should say
and there's a reason for that you do
have to make some compromises yeah you
could spend a bunch of money buy some
really intricate cases and really crazy
coolers maybe your entire case is like
one big heat sink you could do a lot of
that stuff I'm sure but those components
the hardware required is a lot less
accessible to the average consumer
either because it's just rare they don't
make many of those products or because
it's pretty expensive either way it's
not something I'd recommend to the
general consumer unless you just
absolutely want a dead silent PC that
makes no noise at all I've had dead
silent laptops laptops with no moving
parts including no fans my original
MacBook it was just the regular MacBook
the 12-inch one had no fans solid-state
storage so that was cool but you know it
got really hot to the touch
laptops and that form factor generally
do especially under load so there were
some trade-offs there what I have
included a fan personally yeah I would
have I can put up with a little bit of
sound to get the system to run cooler
overall
maybe a little more overclocking
Headroom if you're going for that sort
of thing but the practicality this just
isn't there for the for the general
consumer again I'm stressing general
consumer enthusiasts you want this you
want to build something even better than
this and it's possible that is certainly
an option though and that's the cool
thing knowing that you could do this if
you wanted if I bought a 1050 or a 1050
TI pallet or whatever manufacturer
produces fanless 1050 t is I could do
that I could put that in here and the
system would be much more powerful than
it is but you can see here and I three
more times by results that this system
is not far off from a stock 2400 G with
a fan included so yeah there that you're
only losing about maybe 20 percent of
total CPU overhead by running it fanless
and that's just the result of this
particular case I went with if I had an
open air test bench maybe would have
fared a bit better but in a case like
this which i think is actually pretty
nice it's a nice case from silverstone i
only get down below i think that the
results were to be expected but still
decent and if you're willing to get by
with running games on medium to low
settings in 1080p or 720p and this could
certainly work with that if you guys
liked the video let me know I guess when
that thumbs up I appreciate it thanks to
silverstone for sending out this stuff
and yeah I've got more rise in
benchmarking to do so back to the old
grind
stay tuned a couple more days and all
will be revealed this is science to do
thanks for watching again and thanks for
learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
