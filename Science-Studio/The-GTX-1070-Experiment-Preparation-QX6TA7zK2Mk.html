the studio if you're not following me on
Twitter that's why you're not in the
loop follow me at sc/st salazar and
don't know exactly what was and will be
going on before you see it here on
youtube my buddy drew who you saw from
the BestBuy video which you can check
out currently by the way in the card
above me came over today and brought
over his EVGA gtx 1070 founders edition
graphics card we had a lot of fun with
it we pitted it head-to-head against his
gtx 980ti in multiple rigs we also ran
it in tandem and can have a dual
graphics card scenario with one specific
game see how well that went and
basically just have fun part swapping
seeing what worked well with what and
what didn't work well with what we also
monitored thermals when the fans kicked
in a bunch of stuff we don't really deep
into the comparisons between the 92 TI
and the 1070 considering the fact that
both are very similar in price if you're
unaware of that you can check out the
card above me drew actually left just a
few hours ago I told them I have
something up by the end of tonight but
it's 148 a.m. here in Florida and I
cannot let them down there but I'm not
gonna let all of you down this is a
video that isn't gonna contain much data
at all it's just gonna be more of a
relaxed kick back if you will video from
the studio that's just part swapping
running into problems along the way and
having a good time just just
benchmarking and playing around with
some cool tech but without further ado I
hope you all enjoy porting one of this
series
both of us Drew's gonna sound beautiful
this is workshop workshop day here in
studio we have thanks to Drew a 1070 and
we are pairing that well temporarily
parent out of the gtx 980ti for one
specific benchmark but then we're also
going to be running a wide variety
benchmarks for both the 1070 and the 90
DTI or a see which card truly is better
after the price if you can pick up a 92
ti4 on the same price as a 10-7
currently and of course you have new
architecture lower tvp's with the 1070
clear benefits also more be around but
if the 90 DCI is the better perform when
it comes to fragments we've seen in
games is that something that you should
consider even though the card will run
hotter and will demand more power we're
gonna find all that out in this workshop
of sorts and Dru take it away well I
just did that thanks great yeah it's off
anyways I got my GTX 10 Sony s and EVGA
have paid tax and that darn shipping man
yes that is nice Amazon I found that is
starting to creep in the text when it
comes to certain computer part it's not
all of them and if you're not buying
straight from Amazon's warehouse you're
not gonna pay that tax for the most part
but that's starting to creep into the
states especially on enough people when
you're watching this video are paying
tax already things you buy online but
that's something that we were used to
not having to pay here in the safe and
it seemed like slow that's taking hold
so drew had to experience that just now
I didn't with the 90s this actually
makes this ti a little cheaper than his
card but for the most part where we're
going to say for the sake of this video
is that both cards are equally priced in
their own respects it seems like it's
overclocking nicely we are seeing a lot
out there like really high temps though
with it but that's probably standard
drivers and everything like that
yeah for that
see I ate about sank temperatures that
yeah is overclocked to fifteen fifteen
thirty I want to say I'll have that up
right here you'll see it for real
that's the clock speed of the Ti and
we're still getting about st. temps as
he is with his 1070 and his sense Emmys
clock - it was like 1900 1900 yeah and
it's our bit to keep in mind this is the
founders edition reference cooler and
we're still getting very good overclocks
with the reference cooler that's below
ER yeah so I mean that's probably as
high as we're gonna be able to get those
cards anyway I mean out of the box
non-reference cool of 1070 it's still
gonna have similar clock speeds to what
he has with his here's an EVGA one
community so that means that ebj went
ahead and overclocked the card before
they box them up and sent them out so if
you purchase ones straight from Nvidia
if it's a founders Edition official box
from Nvidia and not third-party branded
or anything like that then your clock
speeds will be the ones you see on the
website that you're looking at right now
but if you're purchasing from a
third-party manufacturer if it's a
founders Edition cooler you're probably
going to have those overclock - drew was
getting so that that eliminates the bias
towards a reference versa non-reference
cooler competition so even though the Ti
is using a non reference on the side
cooler the fact is both are overclocked
to about their maxes for now at least
given the drivers that we have available
to us so with that we have plenty of
games rumi testing drew brought his rig
over you get a high five six 200k there
4.4 gigahertz right oh we can overclock
it to it yeah well we're going at 4.40
Hertz we got sixteen bytes of RAM here's
a red white and blue beautiful 24 gigs
in there right now we roll two of those
out we'll have 16 gigs running at 2400
megahertz and he's got all these games
on the hard drive as do i and this rig
i7 six seven okay you guys know that 4.6
gigahertz and 16 gigabytes of RAM
running at 3,000 megahertz so where you
see how well each card does with each
processor so we're gonna see how well an
i7 does with gaming how well an i5 bets
with gaming we already know that the I
feel much better mean it's more of a
content creation CPU some of the most
part we shouldn't see any variation
there but we'll leave that in a separate
video which you can check out if it's
available in the card above us with that
folks we are going to get to it we have
already been running benchmarks all day
the room is very hot very hot our cards
we hear the blower's are just going to
be enough the exactly's rating and Grady
why do they even I don't know why it
radiates out anyway folks we're going to
go ahead and throw some interesting tech
well know tech corn at you I guess we're
gonna show you a lot very aggravating
bear down yeah it's beautiful if you
will upset your than a lot it's nothing
but his two grand seventy is a beautiful
art so we're gonna take this GoPro we're
going to throw this thing into the rigs
we're gonna see when the fans reach
cooler turns on what our max temps are
going to do all that in these series of
workshop videos we'll have up look at
the channel very soon stay tuned for
those for now enjoy thanks so this will
all be sped up like x times 10 and then
when you're taking out the cards pretty
oh you're doing Bill Channel yes
yeah you know it's just it's the effort
if you think about it like this is a
really short it is sour okay now we're
gonna put this back in and we're gonna
unscrew did you
she I cannot see I can't see where I'm
putting this into there yeah oh good
alright folks we are using a 750 watt be
two bronze power supply I would not
recommend using a power supply on this
low of a wattage under most
circumstances the only reason we've been
trying this is because I know that the
750 watt are skinny that'd be 1070 we'll
be pulling a lot less power than this
one will so hopefully we get by we may
and may may crash our system but that's
okay all the more entertaining for you
all I suppose to do is wire this thing
up and oh I should have I should have
shut up plug these in first okay
now we're good now we're good what you
see what I do there they go by the way
folks the door I think it's gonna get
too hot hey okay am I on the camera at
all okay so I'm not gonna close the door
because I'm afraid temperatures they're
gonna they're gonna spike to undesirable
levels so it will stay open of course
this isn't I guess indicative of a
real-world scenario but this is just
temporary of course we only have one
game to test this out with and that's
ashes the singularity let's see how well
it does see if this works we should
theoretically obtain higher frame rates
than we received with just either one
or the other of these radix courts so
that's that's what we're looking for
here now another thing we're uncertain
about is whether or not these this power
supplied the 750 watt bronze is enough
we're both cards under full load that's
if he I'd say we're gonna be borderline
and again I do not recommend doing this
all the time because it's it's not gonna
stain its peak efficiency curve anyway
over here on the end and your efficiency
is gonna be weighing it out even though
we're 80 plus bronze they lent it so far
it knows we have that restart to repair
drive errors yeah let's do that
please be enabled yes
if you're wondering while the data is
and all the graphs and charts don't
worry folks that it's coming very soon
in part two if it's not already in the
card above me where will pit
head-to-head the gtx 980ti and videos
old-school King against the new cool kid
on the block the gtx 1070 folks stay
tuned for that this is science studio
