the studio if you're not follow me on
Twitter that's why you're not in the
loop follow me at SC ST salazar and
you'll know exactly what was and will be
going on before you see it here on
youtube my buddy drew you saw from the
best buy video which you can check out
currently by the way in the card above
me came over today and brought over his
EVGA GTX 1070 founders edition graphics
card we had a lot of fun with it we
pitted a head-to-head against his gtx
980 TI in multiple rigs we also ran it
in tandem lincoln have a dual graphics
card scenario with one specific game see
how well that went and basically just
have fun part swapping seeing what
worked well with what and what didn't
work well with what we also monitored
thermals when the fans kicked in a bunch
of stuff we don't really deep into the
comparisons between the 980 TI and the
1070 considering the fact that both are
very similar in price if you're unaware
of that you can check out the card above
me drew actually left just a few hours
ago I total might have something up by
the end of tonight but it's 148 am here
in Florida and I can't let them down
there but I'm not gonna let all of you
down this is a video that isn't going to
contain much data at all it's just going
to be more of a relaxed kickback if you
will video from the studio as just part
swapping running into problems along the
way and having a good time justjust
benchmarking and playing around with
some cool tech but without further ado I
hope you all enjoy portland of this
series
oh they have a microphone right here and
we're trying to make it work for both of
us but drew is gonna sound beautiful oh
yeah echo sorry about that folks this is
workshop workshop day here in studio we
have thanks to drew a 1070 and we are
pairing that well temporarily parent at
the G takes on ATT I for one specific
benchmark then we're also going to be
running a wide variety benchmarks for
both the 1070 and the 980 TI or se which
card truly is better after the price
because you can pick up a 92 TI for on
the same price as a 10-7 currently
enough force you have new architecture
lower TTP's whitby 1070 clear benefits
also more v round but if the 92 TI is
the better perform when it comes to
frame rates we've seen games is that
something that you should consider even
though the card will run hotter and will
demand more power we're going to find
all that out in this workshop of sorts
and drew take it away well even though
they plant so yeah I just I did that
thanks great yeah it's off but anyways I
got my gtx 10 70s an EVGA happy taxon
that darn shipping man me that sax man
attacks newegg isn't charging tags
around yes they are that is that as nice
up amazon i found is starting to creep
in the text when it comes to certain
computer part it's not all of them and
if you're not buying straight from
amazon's warehouse you're not going to
pay that tax for the most part but
that's starting to creep into the states
especially on enough people and you're
watching this video our paying tax
already things you buy online but that's
something that we were used to not
having to pay here in the safe that
seemed like slow that's taking hold so
drew had to experience that just now I
didn't with the 90s this actually makes
this ti a little cheaper than his car
but for the most part where we're going
to say for the sake of this video is
that both cards are equally priced in
their own respects it seems like it's
overclocking nicely we are seeing a lot
of really really high temps though with
it but that's probably standard drivers
and everything like that yeah well I
mean for that I mean we might say that
night
TI's being about st. temperatures that
she is overclocked to 15 15 30 i want to
say i'll have that up right here you'll
see it for real that's the clock speed
of the TI and we're still getting about
st. temps as he is with his 1070 and his
sense emmys clock to it was like 1,900
1,900 yeah and it's our bit to keep in
mind this is the founder tradition
reference cooler and we're still getting
very good overclocks with the reference
coolers no that's below yeah so I mean
that's probably as high as we're gonna
be able to get those cards anyway I mean
out of the box non-reference cooler 1070
is still going to have similar clock
speeds to what he had with his here's an
EVGA 19 avg so that means that ebj would
had an overclock the card before they
box them up and sent them out so if you
purchase one straight from Nvidia if
it's a founders edition official box
from Anna video and not third-party
Brandon or anything like that then your
clock speeds will be the ones you see on
the website that you're looking at right
now but if you're purchasing from a
third-party manufacturer if it's a
founders edition cooler you're probably
going to have those overclocked to Drew
was getting good so that eliminates the
bias towards a reference verse
non-reference cooler competition so even
though the TI is using a non reference
on the side cooler the fact is both are
overclocked to about their Max's for now
at least given the drivers that we have
available to us so with that we have
plenty of games roomy testing drew
brought his rig over you get a high five
six six ever came there 4.4 gigahertz
right we can overclock it to it yeah
we're gonna get 4.4 Garrett's we got 16
gigabytes of ram he has a red white and
blue beautiful 24 gates in their right
hand rule two of those out so i'll have
16 gigs running at 2,400 megahertz and
got all these games on the hard drive as
do i and this rig I 767 okay you guys
know that 4.6 gigahertz and 16 gigabytes
of RAM running a 3000 egg hurts so where
you see how well each card does with
each processor so we're going to see how
well an i7 does with gaming how well and
I 5s with gaming we already know that
the idea I don't yield much better mean
it's it's more of content creation CPU
some of the most part we shouldn't see
any variation there but we'll leave that
in a separate video which you can check
out if it's available in the card above
us with that folks we are going to get
to it we have already been run
benchmarks all day the room is very hot
very hot hard life
when you hear the blowers are just going
feel if you know the exact is rating
ready what I even I don't know why okay
it radiated out I read everybody mess
that work out anyway folks we're going
to go ahead and throw some interesting
tech my oh no tech porn at you I guess
we're going to show you a lot of clipper
aggravators fair doubt it yeah it's
beautiful if you will of tech you're
gonna love this Johnson but his to
around 70 is a beautiful card so we're
going to take this GoPro we're going to
throw this thing into the Rings we're
going to see when the fans for each
cooler turns on what our max temps are
going to do all that in these series of
workshop videos up look at the channel
very soon stay tuned for those for now
enjoy thanks guys so this all be sped up
like x x 10 and then when you're taking
out the card instead ball slow it down
and make it look pretty what you're
doing dual channel yes
you
ya know it's just it's the effort if you
think about it like this is a really
short it is tower boom okay now we're
going to put this back in and we gotta
unscrew did you take your his EXT you
plate yep oh why are you yeah I painted
that sucker
yeah chief I cannot see I can't see
where I'm putting this here we go let's
not go into there yeah oh okay good all
right folks we are using a 750 watt be
two bronze power supply I would not
recommend using a power supply of this
low of a wattage under most
circumstances the only reason i may've
been trying this is because i know that
the 750 watt are skinny that be 1070
will be pulling a lot less power than
this one will so hopefully we get by we
may may may crash our system but that's
okay all the more entertaining for you
all I suppose now we're gonna do is wire
this thing up and oh no you know what I
gotta plug this back in I should have I
should have again I should just remove
this and deploy doesn't first nice thank
you shouldn't plug these in first okay
now we're good now we're good what you
can see what I deal with there they go
by the way folks okay Moby mistaken the
door okay I'm not gonna close it I think
it's gonna get too hot I'm already doing
hey okay am I on the camera at all I
might know he really has little
something okay you're good okay okay so
i'm not going to close the door because
i'm afraid temperatures are gonna
they're gonna spike to undesirable
levels so it will stay open of course
this isn't i guess indicative of a
real-world scenario but this is just
temporary of course we only have one
game to test this out with and that's
Ash's the singularity let's see how well
does see this works we should
theoretically obtain higher frame rates
than we received with just either one or
the other
these graphics cards so that's that's
what we're looking for here now another
thing we're uncertain about is whether
or not these this power supply the 750
watt bronze is enough we're both cards
under full load that's iffy I'd say
we're going to be borderline and again I
do not recommend doing this all the time
because it's it's not going to be
stained its peak efficiency curve you're
gonna be way over here on the end and
your efficiency is going to be weighing
it out even though we're 80 plus bronze
I want it so far take the mode though
huh it knows we have that restart to
repair drive errors yeah let's do that
please be enabled yes go
if you're wondering well the data is and
all the graphs and charts don't worry
folks that is coming very soon in part 2
if it's not already on the card above me
where will pit head-to-head the gtx 980
TI and videos old-school King against
the new cool kid on the block the gtx
1070 folks stay tuned for that this is
science to do thanks for learning with
us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
