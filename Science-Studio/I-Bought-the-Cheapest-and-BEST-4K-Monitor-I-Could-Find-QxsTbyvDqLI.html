find there's been overwhelming demand
for budget oriented content lately
presumably in light of the high graphics
card prices saving money elsewhere in
the budget can mean the difference
between a 1050 TI and something like a
gtx 1070 and those two are worlds apart
so if you're interested in an affordable
monitor for content creation or gaming
or just the crispy desktop wallpapers do
what we did and buy something like this
on sale for about 250 bucks it's 4k the
be quiet dark bass 700 brings luxury and
silence to the mainstream luxury thanks
to subtle RGB integration full case
modularity and even USB type-c support
and silence thanks to three included
silent wings three fans and sound
damping foam all around click the link
in this video's description for more
details meet the Acer CV 28 one HK for
short we'll call it the CV 1 now it's
porting a 28 inch 3840 by 2160 panel it
is the most spectacular looking thing on
the market but the price surely was we
paid about 250 a US dollars for it and
our local Best Buy now this admittedly
was quite some time ago actually around
Black Friday the deal was so good we
actually purchased two of them and just
on merit alone now out of the box I
wasn't too impressed with the way it
looked at least physically the bezels
are pretty thick and ugly they protrude
from the display itself by nearly six
and a half millimeters that's thicker
than some smart phones by the way and
just when you think they couldn't get
much worse they also have a glossy
texture which means that they attract
finger prints and they scratch easily
the entire profile for that matter isn't
very slim I kid you not while the bezels
are almost 6.3 5 millimeters thick the
depth of the monitor is about 6.35
centimeters and from front to base we're
looking at just under 24 centimeters so
it's a pretty large monitor remember it
is a 28 inch panel that's a diagonal
length there but this believe it or not
is where the negative stop actually
starting from the structure and stand
the cb1 rotates a full 90 degrees for
both portrait and landscape views and is
also a swivel and height adjustable it's
one of the nicest integrated monitor
stands I've used to be completely honest
it's even got a cutout for cable
management so
you know they're they're really focusing
on all the fine details here the panel
itself has several quality features for
the price for one an integrated AC
converter which means no annoying power
brick to deal with ports underneath
include DVID hdmi and displayport
remember you'll need DisplayPort 1.4 or
two DVI DS or HDMI 2.0 for a true 4k
picture here CV ones also sporting a
dedicated audio in Jack as well as a
headphone jack I think the best part is
that Acer actually includes cables for
all three video ports including
DisplayPort which is pretty cool these
aren't cheap cables you'd think that at
this price point they would find every
single place they could to save money
but they didn't with respect to cables
now the C one also has built-in speakers
another cost-saving feature for gone for
the sake of the consumer despite the
lackluster lows and distorted highs at
just two watts of peace the duo is
actually a pretty great substitute for
those awaiting a decent set of desktop
speakers or headphones oh and one more
thing I forgot to mention about the CB
ones physical characteristics its
evasive mountable so pairing up two or
three of these things actually shouldn't
be a problem at all
and because they're so cheap you know it
probably wouldn't break too many banks
out there to buy two or three of them to
have that duo or triple display now I'm
moving over there because this angle is
really awkward
alright now on to my personal
impressions of the panel I will say
first and foremost the calibrations
right of the box are pretty sweet now
remember that the cameras going to incur
bit of distortion when it comes to the
picture quality that replication that
you're seeing in this video is not going
to be true to life so the panel actually
looks much better in person and I can't
really show you how it looks to be a
camera so you're kind of gonna have to
take my word for it here but I'm gonna
be very critical just because I know
that most of you are going to be as well
when it comes to a 250 to roughly 300
dollar price tag you expect this thing
to fall short in a few areas but I'm
here to tell you that it really doesn't
and I find any fault that I could the
first thing I noticed right out of the
box was the color reproduction it was
spot-on so no calibration needed on my
end in fact of what you're looking at
right now is like the normal that's the
normal picture I didn't actually do
anything to it this is what it should
look like right at the box it will vary
from unit to unit slightly I expect but
I mean as long as the quality controls
decent on these monitors there
look pretty similar to one another and
this one looks spectacular there is no
warm or cool tent at all I think the
white balance is spot-on contrast is
decent especially given the fact that
this is a TN panel now your viewing
angles are gonna be pretty trashed
that's typical of a cheaper TN panel I
would say anything within 30 degrees of
center is going to be okay but passed 30
degrees you will see that color
Distortion
and you can definitely see it from above
and below so make sure this monitor is
at least eye level anything 10 or 20
degrees above or below your line of
sight that's the horizontal line of
sight is going to incur some degree of
color Distortion now if you want to know
more about TN technology and how it
differs from say IPS technology then I
invite you to check out this video right
here but in general a liquid crystal in
a twisted nematic
TN display is slightly curved from top
to bottom and then when you run a
current through it it'll either untwist
slightly or twist a bit more and that
affects how light travels through the
liquid crystal to either turn on or off
that given pixel a course of LCDs are
backlit so each pixel is basically
controlling the amount of light that
passes through the crystal from the
backlight below now this technology
generally sports a bit more overclocking
Headroom but in a 4k monitor it's not
really going to matter much look you've
got 3840 by 2160 pixels multiply those
two numbers together and that's how many
pixels there are packed into this
display so it does get increasingly
difficult now the higher the pixel count
to overclocked a monitor this one really
didn't overclock much of all I think I
got like 62 or 63 Hertz which is
basically undetectable from sixty Hertz
it's not going to matter much here but
you do have a consistent 60 Hertz
refresh rate with this monitor and it's
good enough for 4k I would say I think
if you're gonna invest in a 4k monitor
anyway you're more interested in the
picture quality and clarity then you are
the overall smoothness if you want you
know 144 Hertz or 240 Hertz they do have
to drop to something like 1440p or 1080p
something else I was very impressed with
was the on-screen display there are
several buttons down below that really
aren't dedicated to any particular
function if you click them it opens up a
menu and then each button changes at
least what it does based on the little
pictures that you see above each of the
buttons
on the frame it was actually very easy
to navigate through it didn't require
any you know learning curve at all it's
very straightforward and this is what I
want to see in all monitors you know
buttons that aren't necessarily
dedicated because it's hard to see the
little pictures that are engraved on the
frames at times if you just have you
know the description of the button on
the screen instead it makes things much
easier to navigate through now if you're
worried about backlight bleed don't I
would only be concerned about that on
IPS panels this one being a TN panel
really doesn't have much of anything in
the way of backlight bleed I would say
there's a tiny glow all the way around
the frame and that's just because it's
you know it's not a very expensive panel
so the panel terminates right at the
ends of these plastic frames and that is
where you see a bit of that light bleed
through but it's really only detectable
when you have a perfectly black screen
displaying and when you're in a very
dark room I actually had to boost my
cameras I said like 1600 with an f3
aperture to even notice that there was a
bleed there other than that I've got to
say paying 250 bucks for this was an
absolute steal and I really wish that
they would drop the price consistently
I've been looking online recently you
know it's been two or three months since
Black Friday around when I purchased
this and the prices have gone back up to
around 350 bucks and that's that's like
average for this panel I'd say 350 $400
is what I would set this price to MSRP
and that's usually what you'll find it
at but I recommend waiting especially
you don't need a panel right now wait
for something like this to drop in price
maybe around a holiday
check your local Best Buy or Micro
Center for this particular model or
whatever newer model they have come out
later
and you might be able to find this for
under 300 bucks if so buy two of them
because you're not gonna regret it the
quality here is insane for what you're
paying now if you want this monitor or
one like it I invite you to check out
the video description I have Amazon and
Newegg affiliate links tied to products
that if they're not this one are very
close to this one that should impress
you for the money I try to keep things
you know around 400 bucks or below and
in the 4k resolution if you're
interested in something like that I also
have a few 1080p panels in 1440p panels
down there that I would personally
recommend if you're looking for a higher
refresh rate monitor which is you know
those are the resolutions you want to
look for if you want that if you're
going 4k unless you want to spend you
know thousands of dollars you're gonna
stay around 60 Hertz that's just how
it's gonna be
so you have to weigh these out you know
ask yourself if you prefer image clarity
or if you prefer a faster image you know
a higher refresh rate he really comes
down to the games you play and what you
prefer overall let me know what you
think about this monitor in the comments
below be sure to give this video a
thumbs up if you thought it was cool
thumbs down for the opposite click and
subscribe but if you have it already

this is science studio thanks for
looking with us this thing really does
