do we have the radon r7 370 4 gigabyte
edition might I add and we are going to
run some testing benchmarks with this
CPU if you watched our last benchmarking
video you'll know that we did that one
with the r9 380 well this r7 370 is kind
of like the younger brother of the r9
380 only in this case the younger
brother has been working out a bit more
because this one has 4 gigabytes of vram
where is that for everybody label
somebody there it is 4 gigabytes and
this 4 gigs will allow us to basically
render more gaming data in the
background before it's actually
processed so this would allow you to
increase distance scaling in games in
particular we're going to show you how
we can do that with Grand Theft Auto 5
but basically it's gonna allow your card
to load more data in the background so
that when it needs that data it can
quickly access it and not have to render
it while it's trying to process it so it
basically saves your graphics card some
time and it also makes your games run a
bit smoother especially if you're
playing a demanding game that requires a
lot of VRAM so we're going to get right
into the specs and the performance of
the card right now
so even at this early point in the
benchmarking test it's pretty obvious
that the our 737 isn't packing as much
of a graphic performance punch as the r9
380 however this could be in part due to
the fact that distance scaling is
literally maxed out which uses about 500
megabytes of additional vram with the r9
380 did not have mind you and we've also
turned on the high definition while
flying option which was also in the
advanced graphics tab we're not sure how
much of a performance hit that gives our
r7 370 but let's not get this confused
to the purpose of buying the r7 370 4
gigabyte model over the r9 380 to do by
model that was showcased in our last
video is to take advantage of the
additional RAM unfortunately that also
means requiring the GPU to perform more
intensive tasks it simply put the r7 37
can't handle these intensive tasks to
the extent that the r9 380 could so if
we had an AR 9 384 gigabyte model which
would cost around $210 as of the
recording date of this video we would be
able to take advantage of the additional
2 gigabytes of vram without taking a
severe FPS hit
so what does this mean well basically
the r7 370 doesn't need 4 gigabytes of
vram the card simply isn't able to
handle large loads of data now what
would be the ideal situation for gigs of
VRAM in an r9 380 maybe that's one to
consider you'll be paying an additional
20 to $30 lives then you can truly enjoy
a four gigabyte ram experience
so to sum things up if you're okay with
the 30 to 40 FPS rate on an r7 370 and
want to take advantage of the additional
vram by running some high quality
graphics settings to an extend the r7
370 can handle it at least in GTA 5s
case you know all games were very not
every game will play the same and not
every card will perform the same way
either even if it's from the exact same
manufacturer so one more thing will be
before we conclude this video is compare
head-to-head with these graphs the r9
380 to the r77 keep in mind once again
the r9 380 only has two gigabytes of
vram in the r7 370 4 gigabytes of vram
the particular variant of the r7 370
that we used was the Asus Strix Edition
and we've certainly heard great things
about Strix in the past especially when
it comes to cooling we did notice that
the r7 370 ran much hotter about 10
degrees hotter on average under taller
than our r9 380 lid and the variant of
the r9 380 we used with XFX not as
well-known but surprisingly efficient at
keeping our GPUs cool a cool feature of
the HH strict cart however to get it
cool ok anyway the cool feature is that
the fans don't turn on until the temp
get fairly high around 60 degrees
Celsius we found the fans actually
turned on which means that this car to
run practically silent unless it's under
a near full load our XFX
r9 380 had its fans run all the time
even it boot up the cards fans turned on
so it sounded an issue then the asus
strix variant of either the r9 380 or
the r7 370 might be one for you to
consider
so thank you guys so much for watching
be sure to leave a like or dislike in
the video let us know what we can do to
improve our future videos
and be sure to subscribe so that you can
see more because there will be more to
come
this is science studio thanks for
learning with you
