the product of which I do not like I
make no secret of that I want to say one
thing regarding product reviews kind of
a general sense if the reviewers
themselves are not pointing out
negatives if all you hear are just
positive attributes and why you should
buy something I should always check out
their links because you can buy them and
you know give them money because you're
buying products that they're telling you
are really good that ended up not really
being that great in the long run then
those reviewers have problems and I
don't recommend you watch them I'm going
to be straight up with you I'm not
looking to impress companies by only
pointing out positive so that they'll
send more products to review later and I
can just have a whole stash of things
that I ultimately don't need and
probably won't use but more than one
time and then they'll sit and collect
dust by this point if I want a product
for the most part I can ask the company
in question and usually get a response
if not the product so there's no reason
for me to to hide behind just positivity
that doesn't serve me any long-term
purpose and if you guys thought that
that's what I was doing then I wouldn't
be a viable reviewer and I would lose
all of you which I obviously don't want
to do so when I get a product like this
and the studio I have to be completely
honest with you I hate this case
there are more things in this case that
I would change then keep and there are
also things I would just outright take
away they shouldn't be here period this
is a mid-sized tower by the way not a
full-size tower so you only find seven
slots at the rear that looks can be
deceiving and that's the first thing
you'll notice when you pull this out up
at the box I thought I was getting a
mid-sized tower somewhere along the
lines of an NZXT s340 or fantex p400 in
my opinion those are perfectly sized mid
tower cases that don't compromise very
much on cable management and just you
know dead space you don't want a lot of
empty space in a mid tower case but this
case even though it is modular we'll get
to those things in a second is much
larger than some of the ATX full-size
towers that I've owned in the past I
would take probably about an inch and a
half off the width of this case and then
probably another three inches off the
height then we'd be in mid-size tower
territory but right now this is one
heavy large unnecessarily large case I'm
just not going to do this anymore I'm
going to keep it on the floor one of the
reasons why this case is so
unnecessarily tall is because both the
top and bottom have these strange
aluminum grill covers that serve no
functional purpose but Phoenix says that
these are intended to give the case more
structural rigidity and on top of that
keep dust out but I can guarantee you
dust is not going to worry about these
panels going to slide right through the
insides look they're literally hollow
all the way through so they should just
be taken off period the back also has
about an inch of unnecessary space which
kind of sticks out from the rest of the
chassis again this whole design is just
confusing to me it's unnecessarily large
and things like this are what make it
that way the Phoenix has included three
stock fans with the Shogun though so I
mean I can't complain they're three fans
is pretty good for a case although these
fans are not going to be super good
their case fans what do you expect but
the fact that there are three there
that's decent at least it didn't rebound
on that side now despite only having
seven PCIe slots this is actually a
decent case for water cooling you can
fit up to a 360 millimetre radiator up
top a 280 in the front and a 140 at the
rear but you'll find a few strange
quirks along the way particularly if you
are custom cooling the first of those
being the weird semi basement
Proud cover thing in the front that
houses two SSDs a unique feature of this
case is its integrated RGB lighting
system get this in the SSD trays on that
front panel that's why that front panel
is there to show off those SSDs but let
me say something else there's a reason
why no one has done this until now
and there's also reason why I expect we
won't be seeing this again anytime soon
I mean who gets their sick kicks off of
lighting up their SSDs I get it if it
matches the theme you know if it's like
a blue and black SSD and you've got a
blue and black theme going on inside
okay cool but lighting it up red or
green and most SSDs will look frankly
ugly most of the stickers on the front
aren't inviting it there's no sticker
it's just got a logo or something who
really cares to see that who wants to
see that lit up I'd rather see these
LEDs utilized elsewhere in the case
maybe just integrated RGB lighting for
the entire chassis that would be
something that make this case I don't
know just give it a little more Flair
now back to the whole bit about
modularity this case when it came
shipped in the Box had a bunch of SSD
trays hard drive trays all stacked on
top of each other on the far right side
of the case that's normal the cool thing
about the case is you can remove those
and replace it with just a clean panel
in the front if you want some space for
extra water cooling but I will say that
other companies have done this better
including be quiet to their dark Bass
Pro 900 which I reviewed right here
although I wasn't fond of it just
personally because it was such a large
case does have better modular support it
took forever to get that front flat
panel in the BitFenix Shogun and on top
of that if this case feels a bit
incomplete to you it might be because
there is no top basement cover I'm not
sure why BitFenix stops halfway with the
front SSD mounting system whatever you
want to call it but I do not like having
to see all those cables from my power
supply just kind of laying around there
on the inside it's like why didn't you
just finish it off that's that's me I
like seeing basements especially in mid
tower cases where cable management is
keying for the most part not having a
basement cover here kind of defeats the
purpose of having a basement front panel
at all what else to talk about Oh check
this out okay so you can actually turn
this case into sort of like a drum you
ready for this
you see what I mean it's not that the
build quality is it decent I do like the
fact that they want with an all-aluminum
chassis but the way that they structured
the whole thing just makes it seem cheap
because it's so hollow and it just feels
so I don't know just unnecessarily
metallic I mean just listen to the way
the power button sounds but there are a
few other weird quirks as well now this
is a tempered glass left and right panel
case I get it for the left side that's
understandable you want to see what's on
the inside especially if you're able to
make it look semi decent inside the
Shogun but on the right side I've always
had a problem with this right side
temper glass panels really don't make
much sense at all unless you're just
like a cable management God and even
then who wants to see cables if you even
get the chance to see them on the right
side now BitFenix took a weird approach
here instead of making the right glass
panel see through that actually tinted
it like 100% you cannot see through the
glass period it is still glass for some
reason I guess it just makes you feel
better inside knowing that you have
glass on both sides I don't I don't know
but you can't see through it so if that
was what you were going for the right
side panel you don't have it here now I
do appreciate the velcro straps those
are nice I also like the rubber grounded
cutouts those are also nice most cheap
cases don't include those rubber
grommets so it's good to see those in
there but there is something about the
cable management that just isn't it just
doesn't work here I think it's because
there are these random tables that are
stretching from the backside of the case
up to those LED chargers in the front
where the SSDs go literally this cables
are just sprawled across the basement
floor running directly into these SSD
trays that they couldn't have routed the
cables themselves around the case or
integrated them into all this extra
space that you have to make it look a
bit more pretty in the front or even
where your power supply would go because
remember you can see straight through
the thing because there is no roof how
much are they even asking for this case
holy Sh okay so it looks like about a
hundred and fifty US dollars on Amazon I
wouldn't frankly pay half that oh and by
the way you see this
door here on the front of the BitFenix
Shogun so this I thought was an optical
drive bay door I thought you could just
put you know a CD drive there so I had
to look this up because I thought I was
going crazy apparently there is 0-5 an
inch quarter drive support absolutely
none which means that door is purely
aesthetic for whatever reason if you
want it to look like you can put a CD
drive there but you can't well that's
what the BitFenix Shogun offers you I'm
actually curious at this point to read
some of the other customer reviews let's
see what they thought let's see this one
star review here horrible case cable
routing is ridiculous
io wires are not long enough for some
motherboards it's beauty on the outside
but ugly on the inside about 5,000 thumb
screws inside that were tightened RIA
that's true there were actually tons of
thumb screws that I had to remove in
order to get rid of those hard drive
trees that were in there to begin with
the wires you have to unplug and plug to
use are not worth the headache
not to mention the thumb screws are
tightened to tell them the front and
back the wires in the bottom of the case
looked like a rat's nest thank you thank
you a full PSU shroud could have helped
hide them again thank you
let's try a new wig great case wide open
looks amazing cons the case lacks a
filter on the bottom side of the front
panel so does can easily be sucked in
there is not a top cover for the PSU
section to hide some cabling okay that
seems to be a pretty big concern that
Phoenix so that's all I've got to say
about the BitFenix Shogun I am clearly
not a fan I understand this is a matter
of personal opinion you may end up
loving the case how that expend your
hundred and fifty bucks and have a blast
building in there
it's just not something I would
personally buy it's way too big for a
mid tower case there is no basement
cover which looks tacky I think that the
SSD LEDs look tacky I just I just don't
like it period is it's just not my kind
of case if however you do appreciate the
honesty which I'll be frank was a bit
brutal but I'm not going to sugarcoat
anything for you if I don't like it I
just don't like it and give this video a
thumbs up I appreciate it give this
video a thumbs down if you hate
everything about life or you just didn't
like the video for whatever reason be
sure to click Subscribe but if you
haven't already and I will catch you in
the next video where I review beautiful
it fooled me I thought it was white but
it's a silver motherboard from gigabyte
