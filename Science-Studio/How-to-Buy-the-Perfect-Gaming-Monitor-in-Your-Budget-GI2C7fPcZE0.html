going to run through some very basic
things that you should be looking for in
your first or next monitor of choice I'm
also going to talk about what kinds of
resolutions you'd expect the game in
with said specifications in your PC and
what monitor types I would choose for
said resolutions also will discuss
refresh rate just a bit even though I
have a dedicated video on that a bit old
but the you know facts are still facts
in this video right here so let's get
started which one should you choose for
your next gaming PC the be quiet dark
based Pro 900 white edition is the
definition of both function and form why
are this charging case inversion and
insane water cooling headroom make it
one of a kind or one of 2,000 because
that's all be quiet
offering click the link in this video's
description for more details let's start
with the very basic stuff especially for
beginners but even those who need a
refresher maybe you have a really nice
gaming PC but a really crappy monitors
only a 60 Hertz 720p TN panel with
terrible viewing angles and it's just
been dying to be upgraded for the past
four or five years that's what this
video will seek to do is give you that
upgrade path it'll make you feel
comfortable about your next monitor
purchase as a disclaimer most of the
monitors you've seen reviewed in this
channel have either been loaner samples
which means that I have to return them
after review or I've been allowed to
keep them in exchange for review I've
actually purchased two monitors one for
my suits one from LG but was really only
two everything else that you've seen
reviewed has been sent to me in fact
there are a few monitors laying around
that I haven't even reviewed yet because
there are so many here that's what I
want to stress I'm not biased towards
any company towards any technology in
the sense that I'm being paid or kind of
like handed stuff for free to say good
things about the technology because I
receive all sorts of monitors from all
different companies so keep that in mind
I have a pretty open mind when it comes
to trying out new technology trying out
a new company I never heard of before
and that's what I want to stress before
I go into my preferences when I go
looking for a monitor online the first
thing I ask any beginner when it comes
to choosing a monitor is at what
resolution they intend to game now for
any basic PC that you can build that's
pretty modern that's gonna have a
we start in it I recommend 1080p
bare-minimum even if you're not gonna
have a discrete graphics card in your
system have a 1080p monitor just in case
if you throw a graphics card in there
you can utilize that resolution and bump
all your in-game settings and be good to
go
the second thing I asked beginners is at
what refresh rate do they intend to game
this often involves some sort of
learning curve they've usually never
heard of 120 Hertz refresh rate and I'm
like whoa what will I even be able to
see that many frames is gonna be that
big of a difference should I pay a
hundred 200 bucks more for that higher
refresh rate then the base 60 Hertz
because if they're coming from a console
in particular 60 Hertz flat out gaming
is still a pretty good upgrade from what
they're usually used to unless you're
gaming on a relatively modern console so
I tell them 120 Hertz is going to give
you a really nice fluid buttery image if
you can get that upgrade in a monitor
for around 100 or 200 bucks go for it
it's worth it and you still have the
upgrade path that breathing room if you
want to swap in a more powerful graphics
card later on I found that it's very
difficult to explain to someone who has
not seen 120 Hertz panel in action how
good it actually is and how worth it it
is for the extra price and because
YouTube only supports up to 60 fps I
can't show you 120 over 60 comparison
side-by-side what I can do though is
show you a 30 FPS for 60 FPS comparison
and in my opinion it's a night and day
difference now even though I'm more or
less used to 120 144 FPS at this point
in time jumping down to 60 is still
noticeably better than jumping down all
the way to 30 you're reading twice the
frames per second and it gives you a
very smooth and clean image the law of
diminishing returns though it does
interestingly enough play a role here so
from 30 to 60 you're only increasing
your frame rate per second by 30 frames
but from 60 to 120 let's say that's a 60
frame rate jump right per second but the
difference there visually is a bit more
difficult to notice in many cases I
would say that from 30 to 60 or not is a
huge difference one's really choppy in
my opinion one is pretty smooth 60 120
big difference still it's very very
smooth 120 you will notice a difference
just side-by-side and then I would say
from 120 to 240 Hertz you notice less of
a difference the sweet spot I would say
to anyone with an entry-level PC maybe
core i3 Core i5 risin 3 risin 5 with an
Rx for 60 or something like a gtx 1050
TI would be the 1080p resolution at
least in that monitor and a 120 hertz
refresh rate what this will do is give
you a solid upgrade path you have a
cheaper graphics card that'll only
output 60 frames it's no big deal to
have a hundred twenty Hertz monitor you
won't see the extra frames you might
have some sort of interpolation going on
but the pictures not going to look
anywhere as good as it would at 120
frames per second so if you upgrade your
monitor in the future you'll have the
ability to see those extra frames but
that need to buy another monitor most of
the time when you upgrade your graphics
card you have to upgrade your monitor to
unless you have a really nice monitor
and a not-so-great gaming PC in which
case I would wonder why you hadn't won
or not the other or why you had yeah you
see it I'm saying there so you usually
want to have them kind of moving up the
ladder at the same time and that's why I
recommend having the higher refresh rate
at least so that you have a bit of
breathing room if you want to swap the
1060 say for a 10 70 later on down the
line now for those who have a roughly
$1,000 gaming PC on hand this is where
things really get interesting because
you can do a lot of cool stuff here you
could choose to go for the highest
resolution possible at the expense of a
refresh rate or you could go for the
lowest resolution possible or lowest
resolution comfortable at a really high
refresh rate so if you want 1080p 240
Hertz you just see like that there's a
value in that then that's gonna be your
choice if you really weigh refresh rate
over resolution you would want to go
with a monitor like that I've linked one
down below but I don't recommend most
people go with a 240 Hertz panel it's
just not gonna be worth it and it's
usually gonna be a T and base panel
which means your color reproduction
isn't going to be the best the sweet
spot for most people is gonna be around
1440 P at maybe 60 to 120 Hertz you can
go as high as 4k in some cases but
you'll have to drop in game settings and
keep that refresh rate to 60 Hertz now
what the 1440p 120 Hertz or 144 Hertz so
it doesn't matter they're all kind of
above 100 Hertz so they're gonna look a
lot better than 60 Hertz right what
those do for you is provide you the same
upgrade path that the 1080p 120 Hertz
panel did for those in the roughly $500
gaming PC category if you're packin
let's say a risin 5 or Core i5 CPU and
maybe something like a GTX tents
then you probably won't get the full 144
FPS experience right at the 1440p
resolution in any modern game unless you
really drop settings at which point why
are you bothering to do that just keep
in-game settings high lower your fresh
rate and actually enjoy the visual
experience of the game 60 Hertz is still
okay for people who haven't been used to
120 or 144 Hertz going backwards is it's
pretty tough I'll I'll admit so again
you have that upgrade path at your
disposal for roughly a $1000 gaming PC
go for the 1440p resolution that's my
recommendation and something with over a
100 Hertz refresh rate now if you want
to get really fancy with it let's say
you're content creator or you want to
see extra stuff on the left and right
side of your screen assuming the game is
optimized of course then maybe you want
to go with something similar to what is
behind me this is the via tech G in 34 C
it's an ultra wide 1440p monitor which
means it has a 34 40 by 1440p resolution
with built-in free sync and a 100 Hertz
refresh rate it utilizes VA technology
which stands for vertical alignment I
talked about specifically in this video
right here and I can say without a doubt
this is one of the best value ultra wide
monitors on the market for around 500
bucks or so you get a really clean
picture excellent viewing angles and a
sweet refresh rate with Dilton AMD
freesync it's even got a slight curve to
it which is pretty fancy to give you
that immersive in-game experience a bit
more so than just a flat panel it's not
something I recommend for a TV just
because you'll be cutting into the
viewing angles of people sitting on the
sides of the TV in your living room or
elsewhere but for a monitor where you
expect to be the only person looking at
your screen the curve is nice to see you
can find the vo-tech G and 34c by the
way linked in the video description it's
the one I've been using for quite a
while it's been in several videos and
it's my daily driver for not only gaming
but also content creation kind of the
best of both worlds in this ultra wide
aspect and also the hundred Hertz
refresh rate is still a substantial jump
from 60 again not too expensive around
500 bucks
check it out in the link and let me know
what you think if you have something
similar now on to the cream of the crop
if you've got a really nice gaming PC
chances are you probably don't need to
watch this video because you already
know what you're doing you're willing to
spend that much money on a PC you
probably know what you're doing
but assuming that you don't or maybe
just want a refresher for an old times
sake if you've got a 4k capable PC then
I
getting at least one 4k monitor now
having a refresh rate higher than sixty
Hertz is pretty demanding on any
high-resolution display 4k in particular
is a huge jump from 1080p it's even a
substantial jump from 1440p just in
terms of raw pixel count on screen but
finding 120 Hertz 4k panel is
recommended I would say though wait
until prices drop a bit more they're
pretty expensive right now and there
aren't too many options
so once competition does start to spike
up in the next few years I would say
that 4k 120 Hertz will become rather
mainstream I would say though and I want
to know what you think about this in the
comments below because it might be
controversial especially for those who
already have 4k monitors and have to
justify them somehow that even if you
have a really expensive gaming PC at
your disposal you should still try to
opt for the 1440p high refresh rate
option I say that for two reasons the
first is because even though 4k and
1440p are vastly different in terms of
PPI if you sit far enough back from the
computer screen it's gonna be pretty
difficult to tell the difference between
the two especially if both are around 27
inches or so on top of that going from a
high refresh rate panel let's say 120
Hertz down to just 60 again with 4k
assuming that 120 Hertz option is not
available is a pretty substantial arrow
to the knee it makes it sound like we're
elitist and spoiled with that high
refresh rate but anyone who has a high
refresh rate panel knows the pains of
dropping back down to 60 Hertz I'm kind
of playing devil's advocate here but I
really do live by that principle I've
never owned a 4k monitor or used one as
a daily driver because I don't see the
value in it while they might be cheaper
than 1440p high refresh rate panels I
think that those panels offer more bang
for the buck in terms of your overall
gaming experience 60 Hertz is a big
crippled for many people who are used to
higher refresh rates once you go high
it's really hard to go back down to the
lower stuff and that's why I would say
still try to stick with 1440p go for an
IPS screen you know something that looks
really nice has great color reproduction
that also has a really high refresh rate
so I've linked a really nice one from
Asus in the video description I've owned
a TN panel version of it but I recommend
the IPS version if you want that sweet
color reproduction and still that
insanely high refresh rate at a decent
screen size if you liked this video be
sure to let me know by giving this one a
thumbs up I do appreciate that it also
lets me know that we're headed in the
right direction
in terms of content I don't know why I'm
pointing like this this is what I should
have been doing if you have suggestions
for future videos be sure to leave those
in the comment section I read most
comments within the first hour of this
video is posting so if you're relatively
early to the video when it's uploaded on
a certain date then you might even get a
personal response from me or a thank you
or something along those lines
and stay tuned for more content like
this we're going to do a few PC builds
using rising three CPU so budget
oriented stuff coming very soon
this is science to do thanks for
learning with us I'm really glad I
nailed at that time I was like the 40th
time trying that outro
