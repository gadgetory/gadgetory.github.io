painting PC parts can be a tedious
process if you're uncomfortable with
component disassemblies I say that
because as you'll see in this video the
actual painting isn't all that
complicated
it's the disassemblies of each of the
components that we're going to paint
that can take some time in this video
I'm going to show you how to paint your
graphics card you vrm heat sinks and a
few spare case components the video card
will be disassembling is a g1 gaming
edition graphics card from gigabyte it's
probably one of those complicated video
cards it's assemble you'll see that in
the coming steps the vom heat sinks well
or the vrm heat sinks and the few case
components we'll be painting are the
hard drive covers included with the P
400 that were originally black that will
paint white so with that let's start
disassembling depending on your
motherboard you'll either need a pair of
needle nose pliers or a Phillips
screwdriver in my case I had to push the
retention pins back through the
motherboard to remove the heat spreader
in your case you may only have to remove
a few screws from the bottom of the
board carefully remove the thermal pads
on the bottoms of each and place them
somewhere you won't lose them I also had
to remove the retention pins from the
spreaders but if you're held into place
with screws you won't have to worry
about this we're going to paint these
heat sinks first but you can paint
everything altogether if you so desire
prepare a safe place to paint as always
a sealed environment is preferable but
I'm a baller on a budget so I crafted a
makeshift paint studio out of an old new
egg box your results may vary
collect your VRM heatsinks lay them face
up as the side you'll be seeing the most
and grab ahold of your paint can I'm
going to try good old engine enamel this
time around for a slightly different
finish although Plasti Dip would work
just fine I can speak from experience if
you're interested in that video go ahead
and click the card up top according to
the directions you'll want to spray
approximately eight inches away from the
target shake the can vigorously for a
few minutes provide a few test Bray's to
get familiar with how the cans spray
will affect the paint itself and then
begin by repetitively applying light
films of paint across each heatsink
you'll want to begin spraying while
pointing away from the target and only
stop spraying once you've completely
crossed over to the other side
this method will prevent overspray and
ensure even layers of paint are being
applied with each pass
here's about what they should look like
after one coat weight approximately 10
minutes for each coat to dry and then
repeat the process once more and then
once again paying special attention to
any areas you may have missed during the
first set of passes also never ever ever
ever ever touch the target while it's
drying any doubts
don't touch the thing any finger prints
or smears will be a pain to remove later
on this entire process may require three
or four coats
so now let's move on to the graphics
card and case components get ready for a
bumpy ride remove the items you wish to
paint in my case it was each of these
hard drive covers now these will be
difficult to paint at all these are
included with the P 400 as well as the
gigabyte graphics card this will be a
pain to disassemble this card requires
complete disassembly if we're to paint
both the front shroud and back plate
start by removing the six accessible
screws on the back plate four of these
secure the heatsink to the PCB and the
other to secure the backplate to the
rest of the car with these screws
removed the entire top half of the card
can be removed this may require a bit of
force if the thermal grease is
relatively unforgiving as was mine with
the two sections now apart to disconnect
the fan connector and both LED pins from
the board needlenose pliers may again be
necessary disconnect the heat seen from
the front shroud by removing the two
screws up top as well as the two towards
the back the two pieces should now
disconnect with ease
now remove the nine screws three under
each of the three fans being careful not
to cut into or completely break
individual blades this would be
absolutely disastrous I don't advise
painting fan blades as any added weight
can offset ball bearings and increase
overall drag remove the wind force logo
by unfastening two screws up front
simple as that
and finally remove the screws securing
the PCB to the backplate there should be
five and total
with that we've got the rest of our
parts to paint our four hard drive
covers the graphics card backplate as
well as the front shroud let's take them
outside the process again is
straightforward after shaking the can
for a minute or so hold it roughly eight
inches from the target and conduct a
brushstroke motions across them try your
best to apply even coats and avoid
overspray if at all possible
be sure to allow ten minutes in between
coats and a few hours for the final
product to completely dry before
reassembly speaking of which before we
officially reassemble these things let's
swap out our GPUs stock thermal paste
with a better compound grab high
concentration isopropyl alcohol and a
lint free cloth dab a small amount of
the solution onto the cloth and gently
remove the stock thermal grease repeat
this process a few times until both the
copper pipes and the GPU itself are both
shiny and dry
you
you
take your third-party thermal glue in my
case Arctic silver 5 you can never go
wrong with Arctic silver 5 and apply a
copious amount over the die now don't
absolutely drown the chip of grease but
be sure the entire die is ultimately
covered with the compound you can verify
this by placing the heatsink over the
GPU and allowing the glue to spread
itself over the die if it ends up
completely covered by glue then you've
applied enough the rest of these steps
are literally the exact opposite of
those after mention when it came to
disassembling reconnect the backplate to
the PCB attach the fans to the front
shroud attach the front shroud to the
heatsink reconnect the three headers one
for the fans 2p LEDs to the PCB and
finally Risa cure the card by
reinserting the six screws on the back
of the graphics card
Wow what a beauty what a final product
go ahead and Risa cure the hard drive
covers to the tower chassis being
careful not to remove any paint while
turning the screws the graphics card
should also be a straightforward
installation I'm not gonna waste your
time here
close it up by reconnecting the power
connectors reduce sag if at all possible
and finally admire the final product
I have a personal fetish for white
because white takes on the color of
anything else that you shine at it so in
this case I have an RGB LED kit from
deep cool running the top and side of
this case and basically whatever color I
set the computer to whatever collects of
these LEDs - you can see that the
computer as a whole takes on this color
scheme thanks to the white accents it's
nice to see all of that kind of
culminate into a final product like
you're seeing behind me be sure to give
the video a thumbs up if you think that
the steps were clear and concise and you
liked the end result you have the video
a thumbs down if you hate everything
about life and click the subscribe

this is science to do thanks for
