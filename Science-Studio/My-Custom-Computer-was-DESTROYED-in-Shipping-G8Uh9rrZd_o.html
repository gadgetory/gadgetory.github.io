serious talk now if you follow me on
Twitter you probably already know what
I'm going to be talking about in this
video I did want to highlight a few
things though give you all some pointers
for future PC shipments because I
definitely learned my lesson this time
I'm not I'm not gonna go after UPS I'm
not gonna say that it was completely
their fault I think that the way that I
packed it wasn't the best I will admit
that but we had an incident where the
winter bill but you can check out the
bill blog process and these videos here
was destroyed upon being shipped to
Vegas for CES 2018 so imma show some
before and after clips throughout this
video it won't be a very long one but do
an elaborate a bit more on what I
noticed with the package when it arrived
in Vegas and some my suspicions I do
want to talk about as well regarding how
ups handled the package because it does
look like things were tampered with it's
not like they just open the box to
inspect what was inside especially if
it's being sent via air which I believe
it was I think it was three-day air for
UPS but they intentionally opened the PC
and then proceeded to move around stuff
in there like I had you know empty tubes
I'd basically drained all the fluid
there was a bit of fluid left that kind
of sprayed once the tube but you know
become detached from their fittings and
what-have-you I that's not a big deal
simple cleanup but there was much more
than just a you know minor fluid
spillage all over the components there
were cracked tubes there were missing
screws for the standoffs on the
motherboard difficult for me to wrap my
mind around how screw is managed to
unscrew themselves in shipping okay
especially when they're torqued on as
tightly as possible without stripping
the thing which is what I made sure that
I did before I shipped it because look
I'm gonna be honest and I think anyone
else who works at UPS or FedEx or USPS
any shipping company they're not gonna
treat things with the utmost care okay
they're just trying to get these
packages as quickly as possible to their
destinations and I think that the winter
build really took just the blunt force
of typical shipping company handling it
just it looks like it was tampered with
beyond belief and it was so destroyed
when I found it in Vegas that I decided
it was just a lost cause I literally
told Kris I said take this back to LA
with you tear the thing apart and just
send back
the components piece by piece because
this is just it's just not salvageable
so that's exactly what happened we
showed up at Caesar's Palace and Chris
would be quiet brought us upstairs that
hey dude your PC is pretty messed up we
need you to you know try to work your
magic and see if you can salvage this
thing of course though it was so bad
you're seeing the pictures now that this
thing was just scratched beyond belief
it looks like someone took like a
Phillips head screwdriver and just
chewed through the paint I don't even
know what in the case could have done
this this was a custom painted GPU
bracket and it was just completely
shredded there were just fried screws at
the back where it looked like somebody
tried to I'm gonna remove a graphics
card that wasn't in there thank God the
graphics card wasn't in there because if
it had been I think that that would have
been stolen if it wasn't stolen and
maybe it would have just been completely
destroyed I don't know which one's worse
can I claim either one probably not with
a company like UPS so what I want you to
take away from this little video if you
want kind of a moral of this story be
sure that you take pictures of the
product you're shipping before you ship
it and then have the party who receives
the package also take pictures because
then you'll have a before and after if
you want to make a claim with ups then
you'll have that proof without it you
have no case at all also be sure to
purchase insurance another funny story
there's this whole shipping process and
arrival it was just all bunch of bad
luck because the PC was ready to go you
know early to mid-december I shipped it
to the address that be quieted had sent
me because they they're you know they're
coming from Taiwan so they have to pick
it up basically in LA makes no sense to
ship it just for to Taiwan and you know
have them come back here with it it's
just more money and it's a hassle so
they shipped it to LA or I shipped it to
them in LA and I didn't realize this at
the time but the destination was
actually the NCIX
warehouse for HQ was not really the HQ
but it's a big warehouse at NCIX used to
run and of course now they are bankrupt
so I don't know what exactly was going
on in there it was a refused package
it's what it ended up being like they
sent the package back to me with maybe
in two weeks to go before CES so that
was already the first red flag we were
really upset about that because I feel
like the PC had already you know been
gone been through enough right it hurt
heap entered one entire shipping around
I think it was shipped via UPS Ground
which is probably a bit better for
PC then shipping it via air because then
you know they might find the need to
open the package and see what it's
inside before it jumps on a plane but
the second time I ended up shipping it
via air I'm pretty sure because it was
three days shipping they didn't say it
but I'm pretty sure three day has to be
air from Florida to California anyway
and that I think is when everything went
far for South I think that's when the PC
just got rekt I think that's when they
opened it up and when I started
tampering with everything because look
some of these people have never seen
anything like this before a full-on
custom cooled PC you know I bet that
looks pretty hot an x-ray now for those
wondering how I package the case it's
pretty rudimentary not gonna lie and
that's why I can't really go after ups
only here's was partly my fault as well
I shipped the thing in the original case
box along with the foam inserts there to
keep things rather stable also used a
bedsheet I stuff it inside the case to
keep the tubes in place especially if
they decided to come loose later they
wouldn't scratch any of the components
inside so when the build arrived at
Caesar's Palace I noticed two things
that made me extremely irate first off
the bedsheet that I had stuffed inside
the case was removed it was only sitting
in the box between the case and you know
the box itself so it had been removed
that means that the left side panel had
been taken off and they were doing
something on the inside of the case I'm
sure that there's you know they were
probably some old folks in there who had
never seen anything like this
like well we need to check this out
because it looks pretty suspicious we
got random pipes running everywhere and
bla bla bla bla bla okay that's the
problem with stuff being sent via
airplane second off there were some very
very obvious things missing from the
build when it arrived in Vegas there
were screws that were missing that we're
supposed to be you know objecting to the
motherboard standoff so those were gone
like all three of them on the right side
there were screws on the back that were
supposed to hold the graphics card in
place that were just you know half assed
back in there like that like somebody
had just scrambled to get them back on
before they were supposed to send it on
the plane or whatever like they were in
a rush and they were trying to remove
stuff and they couldn't figure out what
was missing like there was no graphics
card and I thank God because I feel like
that did that would have been wrecked
straight up would have just been
completely destroyed and that's easily
$1000 that's a 1080 Ti in today's market
but back to shipping in general I don't
think that the way I packaged it
ultimate
- this this destruction of the PC I
think that it was either dropped from
five feet or higher or it was
intentionally tampered with and just
wasn't reset the way that I had it
originally looked the bed sheet was
gonna cushion everything even if you
know the motherboard fell off the bed
sheet was there it was stuffed with that
thing and I figured it would at least
protect the inside of the case on the
outside of the case at least the phone
was there but it was a pretty heavy
build so the way I see it somebody
probably tried to pick it up and it
dropped and they probably heard
something break in there and so they
opened up to check on things and they're
just like oh god let's just put this
back in here and send it hope no one
cares so I'm not gonna go after him you
know I don't really think I have a case
anyway I have no insurance I had
insurance the first time I sent it that
bad luck resulted in a recent and on my
part I messed up when I didn't buy
insurance the second time just because I
guess I was too cheap so lesson learned
there I won't say that Pelican cases are
the you know end-all be-all only way to
ship pcs because it you know the other
guys I think was envious mods who's who
had their PC ship to the be quiet Swede
also had theirs destroyed and theirs was
in a Pelican case much nicer packaging
the mine and still it have done the same
thing I think my odds would have been
better if I'd packaged it that way but
still you know I think shipping with ups
was my mistake in the first place so I'm
sorry you guys didn't see the the PC at
CES I was so excited to show you guys
and just kind of like you know check out
this PC build here from which this
channel science studio and just out I
was I was seriously you know I was
excited for it I was really proud of
myself and putting that bill together in
time for CES and it is no longer with us
I'll be receiving the parts back soon
maybe another white build in the future
I just wanted to give you guys an update
I hope that you're not angry at me for
this I mean if anything is a learning
experience for me I'm not gonna hide
anything like that from you guys just
don't make the same mistakes I did
definitely don't ship your PC you know
with a three or four day rush period
even if you have the words fragile on
the Box everywhere which I made sure it
had you know that's not going to stop
people from dropping your box and or
opening it and tampering with what is
inside that's all I have for this video
stay tuned for some legit science
content on the channel this is science
studio thanks for learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
