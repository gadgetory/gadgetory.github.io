this is strange science bull sharks have
the uncanny ability of adapting to and
surviving in both salt and fresh water
they're keen ozma regulatory systems
control the amount of salt permitted
into the body relative to the external
environment in normal fish this system
is fixed any increase or decrease in
water soluble compounds will either
dehydrate or suffocate them but in bull
sharks kidneys can flush this extra salt
out through the process of urination to
equalize with the osmotic pressure of
fresh water or retain it on command the
ability is carried only by a special few
species of shark including the river
shark seen here however it is most
notable in the bull shark because of its
infamous aggression it is in
conclusively believed that shark spikes
and testosterone lead to this erratic
and aggressive behavior but that's
beside the point
there have been some very very strange
shark attack and sighting locations
around the world some of these you will
not believe people often rule out sharks
as potential threats and freshwater
lakes and rivers not that I blame them
though major and even deadly shark
attacks happen every year in these
environments in 2014 a boy was attacked
by a bull shark in Louisiana's own Lake
Ponchartrain a freshwater lake these
attacks are not isolated to a specific
area either in 1955 a man was reportedly
attacked by a bull shark in Lake
Michigan it's also a freshwater lake but
which has an over 1,000 mile trek to the
nearest ocean I should know the
controversy involved with this claim
however bull sharks have not been found
in waters North Massachusetts Neil
entrance into Lake Michigan from the
ocean is via this entrance the st.
Lawrence Seaway several hundred miles
north but what else would attack a man
in Lake Michigan there are other more
credible accounts 19:16 multiple attacks
in New Jersey's freshwater Matawan Creek
were believed to have been the result of
an aggressive shark a single aggressive
shark I might add several these bizarre
attack stories particularly in
freshwater have been carried out by
individual rogue sharks however what
drives these creatures far up freshwater
rivers and lakes is still unknown one
theory is tied to shark adolescence and
the need to avoid larger predators
the bull shark was also found over 2,000
miles up the Amazon River in the country
of Peru
that's Peru this country the Andes are
here that's where glaciers form bull
shark here is quite strange so how about
this one a bull shark in the state of
Illinois USA FYI Illinois is here too
commercial fisherman hook the shark much
to their surprise this meant that the
bull had to swim all the way up the
Mississippi River from the Gulf of
Mexico but why what exactly compelled it
to do so we may never know why these
sharks do these things but it is super
super sketchy
on a sidenote we generally regard bull
sharks as apex predators right free
rumors with endless tropical to
subtropical boundaries and no major
enemies however occasionally thanks to
the fact that they do swim up these
lakes and streams they've been attacked
by crocodiles try picturing that a
crocodile attacking a bull shark
I tried googling it and there's not much
out there now I want to take the rest of
the time this video to open up a
dialogue with all of you I want you all
to leave a suggestion if you can in the
comments below about what you would like
to see in the future for this particular
playlist I consider this almost like a
fallback in a sense that's what the
channel started with and I want to keep
it going in some way I like learning
about this stuff it's why I say thanks
for learning with us at the end of every
every single video because there's
always something for somebody to learn
and oftentimes I'm having to learn at
least something about the topic at hand
before I make the video so if you have a
suggestion leave that in the comments
below I do appreciate it you'll see more
of these in the future meanwhile blue
sky it's waiting on the graphics card
blocks when those get here then part 4
will also be here if you like this video
be sure to give it a thumbs up thumbs
down for the opposite click the
subscribe button if you haven't already
I will catch you in the next video this
is Salazar studio thanks for learning
with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
