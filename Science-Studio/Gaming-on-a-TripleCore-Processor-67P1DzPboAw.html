even singles but not threes three is
just weird that's it's rare but not
impossible
my Hyundai Veloster Turbo has three
doors there's a band called three doors
down and third time is definitely the
charm so let's try this out with a
modern CPU this is part three of four
where we fittingly simulate a triple
core gaming experience because why not
I want to be this in part one but I'm
going to do it again because
reinforcement so click advance down at
the bottom right and then I click
advanced again then you're going to see
CPU configuration can you kind of see
that it's a little overexposed let me
fix that there we go
CPU configuration let's click that and
then scroll down ways now you see here
hyper threading and active processor
cores so for this scenario here we're
going to disable hyper threading and
then we're going to enable only three
cores so we're gonna have three physical
cores running but no hyper threading up
up here to the top click exit click Save
Changes and reset double check the
settings you've changed are correct here
in this final little notification and
then click OK you can check and make
sure everything's cool by opening up
something like hardware monitor and
scrolling down to utilizations here it's
going to show you the CPU basically all
your threads and right now we're seeing
CPU 0 cpu 2 and CPU 4 1 3 &amp;amp; 5 are the
respective hyper threads because we have
hyper threading disabled all you're
seeing here is 0 2 &amp;amp; 4 indicating three
physical cores working right now so
something I haven't done the last two
parts but that I will do starting now I
guess for the last two it shows CPU
usages while we're running the benchmark
so that's really not focusing the
sunlight is like just blasting the
screen okay so everything's exactly the
same I know that because for one leg and
tells which by looking at the memory
usage it's exactly the same so yeah here
we go no advanced graphics oops forgot
to start fraps ok now we're going to
start the benchmark okay so this is
definitely good stuff I'm not really
surprised because it ran perfectly fine
on two cores I have several videos
covering Pentiums and i3 is running GTA
5 so right now three cores really
shouldn't change much it's just odd to
have a three core processor doing this
work because you really don't see many
three core processors being sold anymore
you can see as we're benchmarking the
game CPU usage is well it's fairly high
higher than it normally is look at that
100% we are maxed out right now assuming
in it's been pegged at 100% this entire
time we are definitely CPU bound in the
scenario okay so now we're going to
benchmark city skylines pay special
attention to
raps counter up here in the top left
corner check this out folks a scene like
that boom 100% CPU usage well it was a
second ago but yeah check it out I mean
at least two or three of our CPUs are
over 95 percent right now they are too
and look at scene like this you're
looking at this saying wow this must be
super intensive that's not really an
intensive scene right there you know so
in some cases you will run into severe
cpu bottlenecks and games like these
especially where there's a lot of stuff
going on the CPU plays it like this
right here CPU plays a huge role in
scenes like this and boom that's why
it's a hundred percent across the board
but here's the cool thing despite having
only three cores we obviously were CPU
bound according to MSI Afterburner we
still achieve very respectable frame
rates these are actually comparable to
just a full-on i7 6700 K with all four
cores and hyper threading activated hey
on a side note this stuff came in the
mail I have no idea what's in either of
these boxes so let's go ahead and open
these up oh really
ooh that looked high-tech this has
nothing to do with the video at hand but
I really want to see what's see what
this is some advanced audio weaponry
right here like this it even comes with
its own amplifier yet review of this
coming very soon folks from psycho it's
a pretty cool name - if I do say so
myself again advanced audio weaponry
when someone's got the bollocks to put
that on the cover of their box yeah
worthy of a science studio review that
is for sure
just so everyone knows this is like
impossible to do with one hand where's
my where's my camera man obviously some
sensitive material all up in here ooh an
a pacer ARMA 60 give it per second six
gigabyte per second excuse me that's a
gigabyte that the capital b solid-state
drive to 40 gig alright I smell a PC
build in the very near future what else
we have in here some blade ddr4 16 gigs
3200 megahertz
oh yeah this
a heavy box what I think like how heavy
are Dems like this is getting really out
of hand but there's something else in
here no way oh they got me a t-shirt oh
yeah we can open this up it is a very
tasteful graphic if I do say so myself
look at that ooh I can already say Wow
frame rate has gone way up since the one
core hyper threaded video well folks I
can say without a doubt this one will
run well over your monitors refresh rate
we're looking at around 200 FPS just you
know out of first glance here nice and
smooth this time no frame stuttering of
skipping no artifacts just good old game
play if you could definitely play this
game with three cores no problem even
though it is CPU intensive yeah very
pleasant very smooth overall look at
that look at the consistency and let me
zoom in real quick I know you guys can
see that my poor out look at how
consistent those frames were the entire
time so we didn't have that weird dip
that we had in parts 1 &amp;amp; 2 at about 10%
20% of the way in average FPS 78 point
for pretty much across the board not
really much else to say other than
that's it's a great score
wow I'm getting sniped by somebody right
where I spawn ah wow I'm not good at
this game I'm back inside
dog so sick of these kids camping man
what's up with that yeah he was coming
to camp again he was coming to camp by
the way something I should point out
here CPU usage pretty much pegged at
100% this entire time so something to
take note of I recommend a quad-core
processor at least for Battlefield one
huh I killed one of them that was worth
it all right let's see what we scored
here 101 average FPS up top there not
bad at all so here are the official
benchmarks for each game starting off
with GTA 5 we see a very sharp increase
in frame rates coming from a single
hyper threaded core but not enough to
pull us into four core territory it is
worth noting that our minimum frame rate
did substantially improve indicating a
much more consistent and fluid
experience overall with three physical
cores city skylines mirrors much of what
we see in GT a noticeable improvements
across the board but especially in the
case of the minimum a jump from 13 to 24
is substantial and it's I mean it's
basically the difference between
unplayable and bearable your results may
vary in ashes that the singularity
however something strange happened the
three core simulation yielded higher
frame rates across the board and in the
averages you're seeing here while I
wouldn't say two FPS is a big deal under
normal circumstances in games like these
relying on fewer more powerful cores
power powerful cores overclocking even
higher would likely result in an even
larger gap keep in mind it is easier to
overclock fewer course on our simple
first-person shooter csgo ran with
flying colors surprise surprise we still
aren't up to par with true quad cores in
this one surprisingly but 212 FPS and
even 176 on the minimum should yield a
very smooth and an enjoyable experience
even on a high refresh rate monitor
total war war hammer piece of cake
we saw very stable and consistent frame
rates and even a slight lead when it
came to the minimum fps notice a huge
jump - from 1 to 3 cores and also how
hyper setting really didn't make much of
a difference in that scenario
lastly the battlefield 1 beta these
benchmarks aren't 100% consistent I use
the same map in same weapons but I can't
guarantee 100% repetition obviously it's
not going to happen
however I did not notice any difference
in gameplay between a full-fledged i7
6700 K and this three core simulation
keep in mind with hyper-threading
disabled the benchmarks reinforced this
claimed average frame rates actually
past that of my i7 and the minimum
stayed within a respectable 5 frames of
the top-tier the difference between one
and three cores in this scenario is
actually quite staggering do keep in
mind however that most of the games we
tested here had CPU usage pegged at or
near 100% for all three physical cores
so while a few games appear to benefit
from the reduced core count on paper
four cores is still the way to go in
terms of future proofing astana word but
just get over it and multitasking I must
say I've been enjoying this experiment
lately if you have any ideas for part 4
I really don't know what I'm gonna do
maybe like a dual core dual core hybrid
even though I've done that with the
pentium g 4400 and other CPUs in that
category I'm just I don't know if you
guys wanted to see the same thing done
over again with the only difference
being l3 cache and the small frequency
change but we can do that if you want in
part for something else that you want to
see in part 4 we can do that as well if
you have any suggestions for future
experiments like different series
altogether we can definitely make those
things happen as long as it's affordable
and within the realm of possibilities
here in the studio you liked the video
be sure to give it a thumbs up give it a
thumbs down if you do feel the complete
opposite or if you hate everything my

if you haven't already in stay tuned
report for this series and my first well
non introduction blog vlog is it a blog
of lots of vlog if it's on video I guess
it's a vlog of my Apple experience so
I've been sporting the new MacBook 2016
the iPhone se and the Apple sport watch
I must say at this point I am huge fans
of all of them surprise surprise but
more on that in the vlog stay tuned for
that this is science studio thanks for
the 100k folks stick around good stuff
on the way thanks for learning with us
