sending us to Computex 2019 and we're
back for part two if you want to call it
that of our fantex
sweet tour they didn't know we're making
two videos there was just so much stuff
here that I wanted to break it up so
we're gonna start first with the P 360 X
in this case you guys are familiar with
a P 350 x thought it was a really great
case for the price and they've made some
improvements here that I do want to
highlight very briefly so first off
we've got this nice recessed RGB LED
action going on up front this is
actually functional so this actually
goes all the way through you have extra
little air vents here on the left and
right side of the front panel in
addition to what was already there up
top and down below for improved airflow
we'll be sure to test that when we can
get a sample but the RGB is very nicely
diffused and it is also the case down
here just above the the basement which
protrudes on the left side and this was
something again that you saw on the P
350 X we've also got the same changes in
the P 400 a with that removable rear
PCIe window you can replace with this
bracket right here so if you want a
vertical card you can certainly swap
this out no problems no issues with
those little PCIe bars blocking cables
support and all that good stuff so I
like that addition and then they've also
done one more thing up top to make this
different they have shifted the 240
support further to the left panel so you
should have less issues in terms of
compatibility when you run a 240 mill a
IO you know fan rad combo up top
shouldn't really have issues with either
RAM or motherboard vrm heatsink things
of that sort and the MSRP for this one
is $69.99 sounds familiar right the same
price as the P 400 a there are just
trade-offs here right so you get rubber
grommets and you get more support up
front right up to a 360 here up to 280
for the 360 X here so you know different
compatibility options you can choose and
the good thing is you don't have to pay
more for one or the other whichever you
think is more functional and beautiful
for your build
there's your choice now this is the d1
20 you're looking at it okay it's like
it's the typical distribution plate but
this is designed to work in virtually
any case that has 140 mm fan support at
the rear most of these distribution
place you find on
are compatible with only one case
because cases all have different
dimensions and in order for these to fit
universally you have to come up with
some sort of standard dimension and
using a 140 ml fan it's a pretty darn
good way to start off so in the d1
forties case you can see it is mounted
to the back of this beautiful build here
and look at that look how seamless it is
right so any case again that has a 140
mm fan support at the rear this should
work with they said they've tested many
cases and it fits very seamlessly and
the reason why it does is because if you
have 140 mil support of the rear then
the rest of this block should you know
because it's basically one big line it
shouldn't have any conflicts on this
side there might be a case or two that
has a weird lip here maybe like it bumps
in if there's like vertical graphics
card support on this side but for the
most part it should fit most of those
cases and you can find compatibility
online but this is a really cool idea so
if you want to custom cool and you want
something uniform like this to kind of
just set up your runs a little easier
because that's always a difficult part
for me is trying to figure out how to
optimize my flow paths then this is an
option for you the D 140 how much is it
again 99 so hundred bucks for this thing
and that's you know nothing really crazy
cuz I've seen really expensive
distribution blocks online and the key
is those are tailored toward again
specific cases in this case it's
virtually Universal with any case it has
140 ml support at the rear so really
impressive there and we've got a few
other things to show you guys we're
gonna pivot over to the next room and
I'll look at a few more cases so these
are gonna be more affordable options
they're gonna follow similar issue outs
to say like the 350 EXA p 3x from fan
text and they're gonna they're really
emphasizing the budget options here so
the first one you saw there was the Neo
silent and then these middle two here
the white and the black are the Neo airs
and these are pretty transparent and
porous front panels so you can see the
RGB fans behind there and then also the
Neo G and this one's going to be the
more premium option at 69
cool okay so 69 here and then 59 for the
two in the middle
sorry about that Khal and throwing you
all over the place and then 49 for the
Neo silent so plenty of options here
very affordable and again virtually as
functional as the P 350 X because they
share similar internal chassis so that
is it for the fantex suite thank you
guys for watching both these videos
again caught them off-guard with the two
videos but they have a lot of stuff to
offer and I wanted to do the P 400 a
justice in a separate video and we're
also going to be reviewing that one
along with I'm sure other stuff here
will be building dual systems and other
things coming up so stay tuned for all
of that thanks again to fan texts for
sponsoring us here at Computex 2019 stay
tuned for more coverage it's a science
studio thanks for watching and thanks
for learning
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
