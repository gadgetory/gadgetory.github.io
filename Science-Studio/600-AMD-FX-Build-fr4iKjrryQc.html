build the scorpion if you haven't
noticed by the thumbnail of this video
the name will make sense shortly this
build consists of an AMD FX 6300 hexa
core processor in r9 380 GPU 8 gigabytes
of Crucial Ballistix ram and an EVGA 500
watt 80-plus power supply the featured
parts of this build are a the AMD r9 380
we went with the XFX version of AMD's
newest series based on old architecture
but it will be ok and be the cooler
master hyper t4 since our FX 6300 is
unlocked
we'll be doing a bit of overclocking
this custom cooler should get us to
around 4.2 4.3 gigahertz overclocked
safely which isn't bad on-air mind you
so amano many professional computer
builders live by is assemble your
computer outside of the case first to
ensure that all parts are working
properly it would be ashamed to assemble
such a beautiful work of art only to
have to deconstruct the entire thing
once you find out that it won't post for
some unknown reason the first step in
our building process is to design a
makeshift test bench we took apart an
old TV stand made of plywood and
salvaged the smaller leg portions to
uphold our motherboard next we sketch
the dimensions of an ATX motherboard you
can find those blueprints here
specifically we wanted to ensure that
our mounting pins which we will install
in the next step
align with the holes on our motherboard
since we did have our motherboard at
this point everything was measured with
a ruler so we finished the framework for
where the mounting pins will be for our
ATX motherboard we'll have nine mounting
pins and they'll be applied in these
places on our board once we get all nine
in there we'll be able to kinda sit on
motherboard on top of this the
measurements look to be pretty accurate
so we'll see how my amateurish drafting
skills pay off once we set the
motherboard
on it spins on this block of wood so the
parts for our new build just walked in
through the door and I would like to
present to you the cooler master hyper
team for this part it's critical to our
build because we plan on overclocking
our FX 6300 there's certainly some room
to spare in terms of overclocking when
it comes to that particular AMD
processor and with this hyper t4 we
should be able to push out around four
point four or four point five gigahertz
safely without having to up the voltage
too much and without pushing our tenth
limits okay so this is the box that all
of your mounting pins and screws would
come in we're not gonna need this from
what I've heard because our board is an
AMD 3 plus board and three plus we won't
have to use these because the cooler
itself automatically comes fit with that
ok so this isn't as big and that's good
I didn't want it to be too big
okay so the big selling point for me on
this thing was the fact that there are
four exposed copper pipes on the bottom
here this is perfect for each
conductions thermo 101 and so I want to
make sure that whatever I got had
exposed copper piping on the bottom this
is where our CPU will be I mean it'll be
right under this so this will sit
literally on top of our CPU and we
should just be able to strap it into
place and be good to go then of course
we have our CPU fan header here and this
is a four four pin band header yeah so
shouldn't run nice and quiet as well
it's just a solid family got on there
and I looking forward to slapping it on
our computer it's coming up pretty soon
so stay tuned for that mounting our well
mounting pins was relatively simple we
fastened a pea-sized ball of sticky tack
to the bottom of each mounting pin and
press each firmly into the board
these held up surprisingly well to
ensure that our board would be stable
enough we turned over the board
flipped it facedown with the pins in
place and applied about 20 pounds of
pressure to at the bottom don't skip
this step a damaged motherboard is
probably the most depressing discovery
on the planet we concluded that
aesthetics outweighed our need for
silence in this case so we pulled off
the stock coolermaster fan that came pre
applied with our hyper t4 and replaced
it with a senti 120 millimeter blue LED
fan the procedure was simple just remove
the two brackets screwed in to the back
of the stock fan and reapply them to the
sentai fan in the same fashion
everything checks out
we also have a longer three pin fan
connector in this case so we'll have to
consider ways of cable managing it
properly in the upcoming steps once the
mounts are secured snap the new fan onto
the hyper t4 and you're good to go in
style
the last piece of our scorpion puzzle
has arrived I'm assuming the box that
says Priority Mail it's a lot of board
the bottom the top is likely a component
for our next PC video are so yes our
motherboard arrived
this one is an m5 a 97 revised 2.0 ATX
board equipped with a and B crossfire
real text surround sound and four dimm
slots in the box you'll find that your
board an installation CD and I can know
who uses those anymore a manual this
one's actually pretty good a couple of
SATA cables and i/o shield and some
warranty information we picked this
thing up brand new on eBay for a solid
$70 so you can see our two primary PCIe
ports are South Bridge four dimm slots
capable of dual channeling we'll get to
that in a second our am3+ CPU housed
voltage and surge heatsink and our North
Bridge a very cool black and blue color
scheme for sure
so let's get to building set your
motherboard on its box have your AMD FX
6300 ready your cooler master hyper key
for ready and your RAM which I forgot to
place on the table oh there she is go
ahead and pull out your processor being
very gentle the stock heatsink actually
should come out first since we have a
custom cooler go ahead and set the stock
one to the side we won't be needing it
for this build
pull out your processor and you're ready
to go at this point
lift the metal latch on the side of the
CPU housing grab ahold of your CPU being
careful not to touch any of its metal
pin especially if you have an AMD
processor and match up the golden arrow
on the chip to the white arrow on the
motherboard align both of these and
slide your CPU into its sockets this
requires absolutely no force at all once
the CPU is secure pull down the latch
once more on snap into place your CPU
should be nice and snug at this point
give it a little jiggle or two to make
sure congratulations you've just
installed a central processing unit into
a motherboard let's move on to that Ram
this is the memory our computer will
access when performing temporary tasks
as you can see this is very important
align the invention on the card with the
invention on the board pull back the
hinges and the second and fourth of
Dennis Lots and slide each Ram card into
place this will take some force but
please don't murder your mother board
that out on the cheap one
congratulations you've just installed
your ram into Yatta Yatta yeah you get
the hang of it grab a hold of that sweet
custom hyper t4 and pull off that
plastic notice how we came Amanda to
that fan cable as well
collect your little baggie of thermal
paste open it carefully and apply that a
pea sizes worth of goo smack in the
center of our processor
don't bother spreading it around and
making a mess your cooler will take care
of that speaking of which the only thing
you'll need out of that box of goodies
that came with your hyper t4 is the
metal latch which is compatible with
most if not all a m2 motherboards slide
it between the pipes and the heatsink of
your cooler and set its hinges face down
into the carved slot hinge the side
without the black lever first the other
side proved to be the trickier I needed
a lot of force to snap it into place a
crazy amount of force once that's out of
the way turn that black lever 180
degrees to secure the cooler
grab ahold of that fan cable that you
hopefully cable manage and plug it into
the fan header on your motherboard that
reads something like CPU fan 1 something
like that as long as the CPU something
you're probably all right refer to your
manual if you have any doubts
also note the unbelievably close
clearance we have between our hyper T 4
and our Crucial Ballistix Ram this is
why low-profile Ram is important for
this build in particular at this point
you can either skip ahead to the case
installation of the video or keep
watching if you've already got a handy
test bench to use which we prefer mount
your motherboard on to the mounting pins
you installed earlier and screw it into
place it should be pretty firm at this
point go ahead and grab a hold of your
graphics card admire the sheer beauty of
it for a few seconds and be sure to pull
off any plastic covering your frame fans
and/or display outputs may have on them
push down the lever on your first PCIe
slot money's already down apparently and
snap your graphics card into place this
shouldn't require much force
take a note of the power inputs on the
card in this case the r9 380 requires
two 6-pin power connectors normally test
benches have second-level frames to you
no secure the top of the card but in
this case we use the makeshift prop
underneath the board to keep it from
leaning so for now most of the core of
our build is in place and ready to be
tested
so currently our operating system is
installing we've chosen to go with
Windows 10 not only for its reliability
but it's just it's plain it's simple get
your product key get a thumb drive and
you're ready to go once you are ready to
officially start installing everything
and grab a hold of your case we've got a
few things to prep before we actually
begin assembling since this case only
comes with a one fan we assembled a
second one in the front of the case this
one has a cool red accented LED in it
route your cables appropriately install
the i/o shield that came with your
motherboard should just be a nice little
snap from the place next merge your
motherboard preferably without the
graphics card already installed with the
case this case came with mounting pins
pre-installed but if you are using a
different case be sure those pins are
installed before you set your
motherboard in this stem you can use the
heatsink at the handle of sorts it's
pretty firm you'll be ok
gather the screws that match the
mounting pins and screw you motherboard
into place
a magnetic screwdriver helps quite a bit
especially in those hard-to-reach places
where it's easy to lose a square root
you
install any other fans and our coolers
into your case secure them with the
compatible screws and make sure to check
your cable lengths again there is
nothing worse than installing something
only to find out that its cable will not
reach its intended header
pop out the two slots in the back of
your case that align with the two output
plates on your graphics card
slide the card into place in the same
fashion as before use the larger screws
that came with your case to secure it in
place
at this point turn your computer
right-side up and verify that all of
your connections and mounts are in fact
secure
slide your hard drive into any of the
drive cages in case and use the custom
tools to fasten it at this point it
should be fairly rigid grab a hold of
your power supply and verify that you
have a dust filter of something in place
down there and secure your PSU with its
fan facing downward
we should note only do this if your
computer case sits on legs and is raised
from the floor even so placing the tower
on carpet can suffocate your unit assess
your environment worst case turn your
PSU fan side up funnier cables
throughout the front of your case as we
won't be meeting Leslie half of them
anyway screw your PSU in a place from
the back use either the case screws or
the ones that came with the power supply
it really doesn't matter
pull out the largest power connector
here on motherboards power cable and
install it including the four can add on
to the side cable manage as you go
next let's tackle the graphics card plug
both 6-pin power cables into your GPU
again find a way to cable manage these
hunting down the eight pin CPU connector
near the top of the board and follow the
eight pin cable to it from your power
supply this cable may come in the four
pin x two array but it's no big deal
just install both together as one eight
pin unit you can see here you how we
managed to run the cable underneath our
graphics card this next part is tricky
and tedious but it needs to be done
unfortunately it varies from
motherboards motherboard the bunch of
cables that came pre-installed in your
case well those are the ones that need
to be wired next we won't go through
this step as every case is different as
is every motherboard however you can
refer to your manual for information
regarding how and where to install the
power switch power led hard drive led
USB slots and audio inputs when you
finished wiring also make sure to
connect your hard drive via SATA to your
motherboard and also plug it in from
your power supply once you perform your
final component checks reattach to the
left side panel and screw it into place
from the back and then behold
plugging your monitors keyboard mouse
ethernet cable and sound devices boot
into Windows or whatever operating
system you choose via a thumb drive
install that OS and then behold once
more
