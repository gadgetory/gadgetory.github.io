the standard for almost all PC and
console gamers if you can't play a game
at 1080p it really isn't worth playing
at all I mean am i right
but that's in the past more people want
to be able to play their games at
something like 1440p or even 4k if you
have a beefy enough gaming PC you can
play games at super high resolutions and
on even with like multiple monitors so
if you have two or three monitors and
you can play in 1440p ultra ultra wide
you know more power to you but it
requires a lot of power a lot of
computing power a very powerful graphics
processor so what can you get for 820 H
dollars well I say you can get a very
powerful 1440p gaming rig that can play
almost any game you throw it at at least
60 FPS don't believe me let me show you
my rig so yes I've been listening to a
lot of the comments and many people who
watch our videos in particular don't
live in either the United States or
Canada so I found that a lot of PC parts
tend to be more expensive especially the
newer PC parts particularly the new
Intel skylake lineup skylake processors
and countries like Germany and England
tend to be these 60 to 80 dollars more
than they are in the States so you know
that kind of sucks so what I decided to
do was build a has low base rig of which
most processors are generally more
affordable than the skylake counterparts
except for maybe in the US where you can
get an i-5 6400 for about the same price
as an i5 4460 but in other cases around
the world that might not be true so what
I did was purchase an i5 4460 you know
standard 3.2 gigahertz with a 3.4
gigahertz turbo boost quad core
processor with 6 megabytes of l3 cache
and paired it with an AMD r9 380 4
gigabyte sapphire graphics card in
addition I've thrown in 2 4 gigabyte
sticks of kingston hyperx ddr3 clocked
at 1866 megahertz i've thrown in a
cooler master hyper 212 evo just you
know for the heck of it and
because I hate the stock Intel cooler
and to kind of wrap things up I
purchased an asrock extreme 4lj 1150
motherboard you know just for overkill
sake so you could purchase a cheaper
motherboard than this and certainly
bring down the price but if you ever
feel the need to upgrade to say a 4690k
or 4790k that certainly is available to
you and you will be able to overclock
obviously because it's z97 motherboard
and I also like the nice little dr.
debug edition down at the bottom that's
pretty cool I mean when I first booted
at the computer I was getting an error
code and it was nice to have dr. debug
there to tell me what was wrong it was
actually my Wi-Fi PCI Express card I
pulled that thing out and then rebooted
it and then ended up booting just fine
so it was nice to have that little I
guess notifier there if I didn't have
dr. debug I don't know what I would have
done just started pulling stuff out
until something worked so anyway I put
together a series of for gaming
benchmarks to help you decide if you
think that purchasing it has well I 5
and an r9 380 for gigabyte graphics card
is a sweet little combo for you if
you're interested in gaming at 1440p or
an ultra wide 1080p format either those
are you know fairly similar it's going
to take more processing power to run
full 1440p but if you're interested in
gaming ultra wide 1080p at 2560 by 1080
that's also an option as well also if
you're looking for a more up-to-date
newer PC you could you know replace this
core i5 4460 and a z97 motherboard with
maybe an i5 6500 or equivalent and you
know maybe like an h1 70 or Z 171 board
even a B 150 will do just fine
if you're not looking to upgrade in the
future or overclock and any point
thanks Intel for locking that base clock
method
appreciate it so if you're a dying like
fan look for around 79 to 80 ish fps at
1080p on average and almost right at 60
FPS at 1440p keep in mind that we've
maxed everything out and only turned off
that annoying blur effect I think it's
annoying you may not have been I would
turn that off and also MSAA just because
that completely murders almost any
graphics card on the market now if
you're not a zombie fan maybe your dirt
rally
fan maybe you like to race cars on your
gaming PC so we threw this one in there
and we achieved about 78 FPS so about
the same as dying light and then in
1440p we reach 64 to 65
FPS on average our maxes and minimums
were also fairly consistent
now just for giggles I'm sure this won't
apply to all of you but I think most of
you are at least somewhat curious as to
how well this game plays minecraft so of
course we could max everything out in
Minecraft and we did that we played it
at 1080p and at 1440p and whoo so our
average frame rate was about 316 and
1440p it only jumped up about 40 fps and
1080p but that's besides the point this
game is pretty much playable at anything
including 4k so we also achieved a max
FPS of 524 in 1080p and for 98 1440p
that's not too bad so if you recall from
one of our previous core i5 skylake
gaming pcs we were able to achieve an
average FPS of about a hundred in this
case we did lose about 15 FPS on the
average but you know that could be
because of a number of factors including
but not limited to our faster ddr4 ram
and just the newer 14 nanometer skylake
architecture first the 22 nanometer
Haswell architecture so there's not much
you can do there but I would say that 83
fps at 1080p is still very very playable
especially if you only have a 60 Hertz
monitor in which case you'll only see 60
frames per second regardless now if
you're looking to play something like
GTA 5 and 1440p you will definitely
notice an FPS cut from 1080p but I would
say that 58 59 FPS is still pretty darn
good for an r9 380 and and will pretty
much the cheapest i5 you can buy from
Intel at this point 59 FPS is very good
for the average I would like to note
however if you take a look at the
minimums the minimum in 1080p was 69 FPS
whereas the minimum in 1440p dropped all
the way down to 31 so now what this
basically says is that 1440p is just
much more taxing on both the GPU and the
CPU at this high of a resolution there
are just so many more pixels to have to
render per second it's just more taxing
so you will see sharper frame dips when
you approach 4 K and a rig like this I
would recommend playing anything in 4k
with this rig but if you want to I guess
you can play minecraft before K or
something like that but if you're
wanting to play something very CPU
intensive like Grand Theft Auto 5 at 4k
I recommend a very powerful i5 perhaps
even an overclocked i5 or just an i7 and
pair that with at least an RN 380 but I
would I would recommend an r9 390 or
something like a GTX 970
on an Phidias side keep in mind though
you don't have to purchase an expensive
motherboard like I did you don't need a
z97 motherboard to run an i5 4460 I mean
kind of is crazy in a way I just like
having that option if I ever needed to
replace that CPU with one that is
overclockable and until kcp you but most
people aren't looking forward to doing
that
they just purchase the PC and that's
what they're assuming they're going to
be stuck with for a while so you can
definitely replace the z97 with
something like an H 81 for 50 60 bucks
and put that money towards a better
graphics card and who knows maybe even
achieve higher frame rates and I was
able to in this $800 rig for a similar
$800 rig other factors that work into
that $100 price tag include the corsair
car by 400 C which was $100 computer
case you could certainly cut that in
half at least to about 50 bucks if you
want a cheaper computer case and like I
said you can save money on a cheaper
motherboard as well you want to have as
many features as z97 xtreme will but
you're gonna have a motherboard and
you're gonna have you know a processor
and a really really good graphics card
if you plan on reallocating that money
somewhere else to achieve higher frames
per second and if that's all that
matters to you by all means crush this
PC in games so share the knowledge put
those PC part picker links in the
comments below let people know what you
were able to do for 800 ish dollars
