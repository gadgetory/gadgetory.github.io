genome this mid-tower case has a special
place in my heart thanks to its special
design not only can you pick this case
up in either white or black variants
with different accents and fluid
coloring but you can also maintain a
very clean build if you're willing to
put in the effort the entire right side
of this case beckons excellent cable
management and almost forces you to
focus on the finer details and it's
about time a staple of the genome is its
included 360 millimetre radiator in my
opinion if you're planning on liquid
cooling your CPU and into some hefty
overclocking look no further this one's
already integrated into the case
includes three 120 millimeter fans a
slick design upfront which really serves
no purpose other than just looking
awesome and a water blocked pump combo
that looks spectacular with any
complimenting hardware it's also very
quiet as quiet as any NZXT crack and
I've ever used
the fans do get loud under load however
so tweak your curves accordingly the
basement in this case spans its length
the few cutouts here and there for
ventilation and cable management full
and extended power supplies are welcome
and the removable hard drive tray can be
positioned further toward the front of
the basement for extra breathing room to
solid-state drive trays rest behind the
motherboard panel which are held in
place by single thumb screws and secured
to their drives via 4 screws from the
rear building was a pleasure thanks to
the genome several zip-tie grooves and
recessed back panel and while the
web-like structure of the cases interior
is all revealing to the mess of cables
included with the front IO with proper
cable management you can make these
disappear and give the front of your
case a clean aesthetic as seen through
the acrylic window the genome also
includes rubber grommet and cutouts for
routing things like SATA and 24 pin
cables without compromising on the whole
clean vibe motherboard standoffs are
included although I do wish deep pool
included a single stand off guide that
doesn't require a screw always makes the
motherboard installation less of a
hassle any white accented motherboard
should go nicely with this variant of
the case I opted for the EZ 270 extreme
for from asrock and as mentioned earlier
full-size ATX motherboards are supported
although II ATX and larger are not
thanks to the web shroud on the right
with the now included riser cord one of
the genomes improvements this time
around you can orient a graphics card
vertically to show off those epic active
cooling systems yeah it's a fancy way of
saying fans the riser isn't perfect and
a few unlucky individuals are bound to
receive one that's DOA or damaged I was
one of them well my dad was more on that
right here also a fancy build log in a
case it looks very similar to the one
we're viewing in this video worst case
the riser doesn't work and you're forced
to rotate your card back to its standard
position not really big deal in my book
but I can't imagine why that would be
frustrating for some so if you play your
cards right you can turn the deep cool
genome into one heck of a house for your
custom PC it has all the right features
a savvy face with conservative internals
and satisfactory build quality
nothing premium but you know you're not
paying for premium here it is a bit
pricey but if you do the math you're
paying anywhere between sixty to a
hundred bucks for the case and around
100 US dollars for the 360 millimeter AI
oh definitely an exquisite combo for a
justifiable price if you already plan on
water cooling your rig give it a chance
check it out in the link below I have a
feeling you won't be disappointed if
you'd like to see a PC case reviewed on
this channel without us being too
Hardware Canuck see let me know what you
would like to see in the comments below
I do have a lien lis case as well as a
bid Phoenix case both are sitting in the
living room right now different
audiences intended for both of those
cases so we'll have a healthy bit of
diversity here on the channel also an
ITX build on the way thanks to as well
we have an X 99 ITX motherboard that
we'll be using
along with a 5820k and maybe a gtx 1070
from here i might just go all in and buy
a 1080 for this rig just to say that we
have an epic editing and gaming rig
packed into something as small as an ode
202 which is our case of choice as well
that'll be an interesting video along
with those two review cases and a few
experiments with some CPUs all that is
on the way if you like this particular
video be sure to give this one a thumbs
up give it a thumbs down if you feel the
complete opposite or if you hate
everything about life click the
subscribe button on why I just use my
pinky for that click the subscribe
button if you haven't already stay tuned
for the videos I just mentioned this is
Salazar studio I really like wearing the
shirt in videos I just realized that
thanks for learning with this
