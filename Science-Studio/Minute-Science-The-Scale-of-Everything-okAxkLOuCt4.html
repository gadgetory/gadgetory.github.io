universe is hydrogen comprised in most
cases of a single proton and orbiting
electron more formally regarded as
protium say that instead of hydrogen
from now on and you'll sound extra
sophisticated 99.99% of the time
that's because deuterium and tritium
make up the other point Oh 1% a single
protium atom is extremely small if we're
including the orbital diameter of the
electron and atom is roughly 160 Co
meters wide this is a hydrogen atom here
so if an atom of hydrogen was the size
of a golf ball the diameter of a single
strand of human hair would stretch
across the Strait of Dover with room to
spare that's 25 miles by the way or 40.2
km/h Intel CPU transistor which I
explain in more detail right here well
even at this size the distance between
individual fins is actually not large at
all using skylight 14 nanometer
architecture as a reference the distance
between two fins is roughly 40
nanometers meaning that we could fit 132
protium atoms and some change across
this distance still too small assuming a
uniform distribution of transistor fins
dot an entire sky like CPU die in a
single fin per square try gate
transistor we could fit just under 30
and a half trillion atoms into that dye
this again assumes that the dye itself
has been entirely out of hydrogen which
is definitely not the case so let's keep
going then visible light that narrow
slice of electromagnetic radiation the
humans can see has wavelengths between
roughly 400 and 700 nanometers still 100
times smaller than the diameter of a
single human hair let's move up to that
next it would take 485 hair stacked
side-by-side to span the thickness of
the world's thinnest smartphone
currently the vivo x5x at four point
seven five millimeters 30% slimmer than
the iPhone six let's talk about animals
for a second the world's largest spider
the Goliath bird-eating tarantula is
recorded to have reached 30 and a half
centimeters or one foot but that's
nothing compared to the largest shark
ever found a 12 point 2 meter long whale
shark got you there I should also
mention the largest animal in existence
currently is the blue whale which can
reach lengths of up to 30 meters or 98
feet the tallest man-made structure of
the Burj Kalifa stretches 830 meters
high I'll be visiting it very soon by
the way stay tuned for that and is the
equivalent of just under 28 of blue
whales stack nose to tail
the tallest not on earth Mount Everest
stretches 8,848 metres high nearly 11
Burj Khalifa's and we're about to leave
her so let's go ahead and take a step
back for a second now since we started
with a single protium Adam how many of
those would it take to reach the summit
of Mount Everest from sea-level this
many 83 trillion Ford and 71 billion 698
million of them had an altitude of 100
kilometres 62 miles of a sea-level
outerspace quote-unquote begins
according to the Karman line treaties in
the same way that it takes 11 Burj
Khalifa's 3 to the summit of Mount
Everest it takes 11 Everest to reach the
edge of space distance to the moon on
average three hundred eighty four
thousand four hundred kilometers the
average diameter of Earth's orbit around
the Sun is 300 million kilometers at 781
times the distance to the moon and the
average diameter of our solar system is
nine point 1 billion kilometres the
distance to the next nearest star
ready for this one four point two two
light-years since light travels 299
thousand seven hundred ninety-two
kilometers per second we can calculate
the linear distance to this star Proxima
Centauri by the way roughly thirty nine
trillion nine hundred billion kilometers
or two hundred seventy-one thousand
astronomical units 207 one thousand
times further than the earth is from the
Sun the diameter of the Milky Way comes
out to just over one hundred thousand
light-years and the diameter of the
universe you ask 93 billion light years
that's the observable part at least and
how many atoms across this many this is
