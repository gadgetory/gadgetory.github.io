video for the I read playlist where I
read ridiculous comments or ridiculous
postings from people trying to sell
stuff in this case on Craigslist this is
another Craigslist edition and I was
recently scrolling just to see if I
could find some decent use graphics card
sales on sites like Craigslist I have a
couple from like offer up maybe one or
two from eBay but mostly Craigslist
because that's just been the traditional
way to sell things online especially
local so I went all across the states
trying to find some decent deals
actually for once and I really struggled
to come across graphics cards that were
anywhere close to MSRP still there's
been a lot of talk about eBay having
their prices drop significantly closer
to the original MSRP of some of these
cards at the 1074 around 400 450 dollars
and that's you know that's great null
but that's still not what they should be
they should be under 400 bucks now
especially after the 1080i release that
bumped the 1080 price down to about 450
500 dollars the 1070 should be fair
market value right now around $350 and
in the ballpark but we're not seeing
that still and you'll see that as well
in some of these craigslist ads people
still want ridiculous sums of cash for
their cards so I hope you enjoy and
maybe have a laugh out of this one all
right so the low prices always catch me
especially when the words graphics cards
are included in the title this guy wants
55 bucks for I kid you not a Titan XP
box the GPU obviously is not included
there I didn't know this was a thing
apparently he says that they're selling
for much more online right so the reso
cadiz is around a hundred bucks or so
apparently on eBay and he's obviously
doing you a service by only asking 55
bucks per box I mean if you're into that
kind of thing sure in my opinion this is
like putting like a core i7 sticker on
like a PC running an Intel Atom
processor I don't know something like
that this is just I don't know why you'd
want these boxes I guess they're
beautiful never owned one I probably
never will especially at these prices
this one what's so funny I actually
shared this on Twitter I couldn't help
myself
these are little gaming boxes right so
these are the boxes that you would hook
up to like an ultrabook the
Thunderbolt three cable and you could
run discrete graphics on those laptops
so and essentially what this is is just
a gtx 1070 and an enclosure that has a
couple dunder thunderbolt three ports
has a you know dedicated power port and
that's literally it people are buying
these they're ripping the graphics cards
out of them and then just trying to sell
the boxes so he's trying to sell just
the box without a graphics card in it
for a hundred and sixty dollars I
doesn't gets funny that that's what it's
come to like we are resorting to buying
these things ripping the main components
out of them and then trying to sell the
shells like it's just so sad all right
this will be a good one $4,500 asking
price for a custom professional high
powered PC the specs right off the top
of bag and tell you he's asking way more
than he should he's got a single 1080 TI
okay let's give him a thousand bucks
let's just say a thousand dollars for
that card and an i7 1700 X which for all
intents and purposes is an 8700 K and
that you shouldn't buy it you shouldn't
buy this one right here this is a this
is a ridiculous process it really
shouldn't exist and that's gonna use the
x-29 and platform
he has look he even listed the thermal
paste as like the third the third
component in this list eight 115 i from
corsair x 299 prime from Asus he's got
64 gigs of RAM okay I'll admit that's a
crap ton of money alright but it still
puts this nowhere near $4,500 territory
so I mean it's not like he's using a
really expensive case either to be frank
he's also including an ultra wide
monitor from LG but these run for I mean
like two three hundred dollars and use
don't even know a lot cheaper than that
but yeah this is this is over the top
his asking price is ridiculous and I
would be very surprised if he even gets
an offer at this price point now this
isn't a theory of mining rig looks like
a custom built chassis 6rx 588 gig cards
the other components in here pretty
useless to be frank and Intel processor
like he's so vague about it because I'm
you zoom in here he's vague because it's
probably like a you know a Celeron or a
pentium i 1:20 SSD and only four gigs of
ram 881 motherboard a beefy power supply
obviously to power 6
but he is asking a hefty premium for the
he's asking for almost $1,000 per card
unless he's bundling something else that
brings this price up to well above
$3,000 this is uh this is a bit
outrageous here all right here's one
that looks in deceiving this might look
just at first glance like a pretty sweet
deal you're getting basically a whole
platform here right CPU 16 gigs of ram
which is enough for 99% of you and a
motherboard for 250 bucks but then
scroll down you see what he's what he's
including in that and AMD FX 6300 might
as well be a space heater
we got a gigabyte G a 70 LM T this is a
bare-bones motherboard I remember back
in the day these were selling for 50 60
bucks it was a fairly cheap board I did
own this exact board by the way and then
we have 16 gigs of ddr3 Crucial
Ballistix and that's it right so if we
say that the 16 gigs of ram is I don't
know I had 16 gigs of ddr3 I don't know
it doesn't equate evenly ddr4 in terms
of price so ddr4 would be around 200
bucks or so for this let's say it's a
hundred 150 let's give him 150 bucks
okay just because it's used 150 dollars
for this 16 gigs you know kid of RAM and
then the motherboard which I wouldn't
pay a dime over 20 bucks for and that's
probably doing a service it doesn't
deserve I mean look we got we got IDE
characters on this thing and then an FX
6300 I'll check that out CPU cooler
included well I would hope so it's the
stock cooler all right now at first
glance this card also might appear
overpriced but this is a full-fledged
1080 Ti here gigabyte horas addition
it's a beefy cooler from a reliable
company only a $700 asking price you
know this isn't too bad most of these
cards are going for eight nine hundred a
thousand dollars even elsewhere so
occasionally you'll find something like
this not too far from the initial MSRP
and you'll probably feel pretty
comfortable in this current market
paying that price I think this is from
the same seller a gtx 1070 this time a
gigabyte and g1 card $400 which
literally is the MSRP of a 10-7 or was
the MSRP of a 1070 back when it was
released so this this actually isn't too
bad at all I mean you're you're not
getting the price discount right with
kind of the the maturing of the hardware
but you're probably not gonna feel any
buyers from Moore's paying 400 bucks for
this right now again in the current
market alright this one here just
typical you know overpriced graphics
card offers $850 for a gtx 1070 TI this
isn't like a for the 1/2 edition or
anything like that from EVGA general
run-of-the-mill 1070 TI and he's very
explicit right you can use these for
mining and they're selling for
apparently $1000 so they're really hard
to come by
apparently just have a really great like
you know mega hash to wat ratio it's
basically how effective the card is at
mining per unit power consumed on a 1070
the 1070 TI are pretty sweet so that's
why these are usually very expensive
online 850 bucks though not a chance in
my book all right now you're probably
looking at me like Greg why are you
throwing a prebuilt in here and because
of the bargain if you really think about
what you're getting in this if you want
to just take all these components out
put them into a custom case called a
custom build do whatever you want with
it you know how you feel about the way
the case looks on the outside is really
not important here because the price is
actually pretty good so you're getting
in 7700 I 7 which isn't that you know
that's it's KB Lake it's not a copy Lake
but still it's a really great i7 one of
the best for gaming 16 gigs of ram which
is enough a gtx 1070 a 256 gig SSD and a
one terabyte hard drive this i haven't
checked online how much it retails for
but if you just broke this down parts
wise about 300 bucks for this let's say
for let's let's say $500 for 1070 right
so that's $800 already 16 gigs of ram
puts us at near $1000 so you're already
getting a pretty sweet deal and that's
not including a storage drives the
motherboard or the power supply XFX AMD
radeon RX vega 56 this is all pretty
redundant and a 1500 are asking price
that is insane entire pcs that could
perform with graphics cards better than
this thing can be built for less than
$1500 I'm just saying one two three four
five six seven eight nine 10 he's got 20
of them here so 20 times 800 at $16,000
in graphics card you're looking at right
here assuming he gets what he's asking
for for every one of the
this is another 980ti that is fairly
priced again we're talking basically
1070 performance here with a little
extra power draw on the Maxwell side
this is the reference cooler so it will
be a bit louder maybe run a bit hotter
but for 325 bucks heck up I live near
here I'd probably buy that for a new
gaming PC just because this is gonna
pull really anything in 1080p in 1440p
and if you wanted a comparable 1070 card
we're talking upwards of six seven
hundred dollars which is twice the
asking price
this one no I have here our x5 80 plus
ram plus CP plus power supply alright so
I love how he like groups all these up
in the title right so he's acting like
he's gonna bundle all of this stuff for
$225 which would be an insane deal
regardless I think of what Ram or CPU is
throwing in there but he's just selling
the RX 580 for 225 bucks this is also
not bad at all
so this is actually an 8 gig card to
sissy a gig variant and unless I'm
reading something wrong in here his
asking price for the card is $225 so
yeah he might be trying to mislead G
kind of did in the title anyway but if
he's just talking about the card here
this is an excellent price I don't
expect if that's the case this ad will
be around much longer all right now this
one an Rx 484 gig card for 220 bucks
this one's it's not you know outrageous
he's not asking for hundred five hundred
dollars like some other people are we'll
get to those shortly this is an example
of like an okay deal in today's markets
so he's not trying to price gouge it
probably did pay a bit less for it I'm
assuming unless he bought it you know
during the middle of the mining craze
and I will have to say that this is also
one of the better deals that you'll see
in this video when I get these come out
of the way first because things get
pretty rough later on here let's go
ahead and move on to the next one
scrolling through this one look pretty
cool I saw three graphics cards like wow
okay 3-way SLI maybe he's got some
Maxwell stuff in here but no GeForce
9800 GTX and then we go to phenom ii x4
965 cpu 4 core cpu and he's using the
stock AMD cooler this thing honestly I
mean this is gonna perform worse than my
5 to 6 under dollar build that I put
together in this video right here you're
more or less painful like the vintage
aspect here
have three 9800 GT X's but even though
you got three of them in here remember
SLI kind of degrades performance-wise
with every card that you throw into it
it's also not going to be very efficient
it'll be probably very loud and the
frame rate will be rather disappointing
considering you know in the backyard you
got three graphics cards in there
they're just so old not really gonna
keep up with modern titles this one
looked pretty sweet I 787 hundred kg
takes 1080i all the good stuff you want
RGB it's got a 570 ex case from course
there the total price for this according
to the seller is twenty eight hundred
fifty dollars but again if we just break
it down this let's say let's say four
hundred bucks for this so I give them
the benefit of the doubt four hundred
dollars let's do another two hundred
that's six hundred bucks and then
another 150 at 750 and then so 750
dollars not including storage or the
cooler 750 plus let's say $1,000 for
this worst case
so that's 1,750 bucks the cases was the
case running out for 200 bucks 1950 and
then the power supply let's say another
150 bucks
so $2,100 and all we have left is the
cooler and the SSD and we're still not
at 20 $150 so again just kind of run
through these prices in your head just a
ballpark them and if it seems reasonable
maybe you can haggle if they're asking
this much though $2,800 $2,800 for this
now this is an example of a great deal
look at that 8700 K 16 gigs of RAM GTX
1080 240 gig SSD one terabyte hard drive
and windows included for thirteen
hundred and forty nine bucks just break
it down $400 here that's $200 that's 600
bucks and then where's the graphics card
600 bucks right here is another let's
say 600 dollars let's say worst case 600
bucks for a 1080 right maybe a little
more than that that's already $1200 plus
the liquid cooler that puts us around
1,300 bucks boom that's already what
he's asking for so you're getting an
extra you're getting the motherboard
you're getting a hard drive you're
getting an SSD sorry about that you're
getting the case and you're getting a
power supply basically for free in the
current
market or if you want look at this
another way you're paying almost
pre-mining craze MSRP for this build
which in today's era is pretty sweet
this one at first glance look pretty
good right you get a gaming PC and an
HTC vive which used to be about what
five six hundred bucks for only nine
hundred fifty dollars I was like wow I
get a VR kit for free but then I
scrolled down I mean the PC looks decent
looks like he knows what he's doing he
only has an on XFX RX 560 in here but
this is where I have a huge problem
write an RX 564 VR is not gonna work and
I think they'll I think in our X 480 or
rx 580 or five seven is the bare minimum
and the reason why those are the minimum
is because you need around 90 FPS with
VR to enjoy the experience if you only
do 60 FPS that close it causes headaches
and things people have found out so
that's why that the system requirements
are VR pretty high I mean he says down
here the five is a complete VR system
and runs pretty well as computer as it
stands but will definitely grow with you
as you get more acclimated to what VR
can or can't do reasonably I'll tell you
what it can't do it you can't it won't
run on an Rx 560 that was his first
mistake he's probably got a really bad
impression of VR now but this system
just can't keep up with that but this is
actually a pretty sweet deal here I was
looking through the list of things he's
including so for some reason he never
actually built this PC but he's got
everything brand new in their boxes
horizon 1700 AC scroll air six he's got
a 960 pro 512 gig in vme SSD and 850 Evo
500 gig SSD 16 gigs of trident z ddr4
and asus strix
1070 TI EVGA g2 850 watt power supply
and he's literally bundling it all for
just $900 she's not parting it out piece
by piece you gotta buy it all at once
but still 900 bucks if I look near this
guy I would buy this stuff in a
heartbeat for that price here's one that
kind of made me chuckle so this guy is
selling a super high-end PC I put
together less than four months ago so a
custom loop you know he's got the right
components right i 780 700 k SZ 370
board 16 gigs of ram he's got a gtx 1080
TI water force graphics card a 960 Evo
nvme SSD 250 gigs
and he's got a 500 watt power supply
this is probably a bit under key light I
suggest maybe 6 to 700 Watts even though
a 500 is still fine you can get away
with this but to stay well within your
efficiency curve 600 to 700 watts is
probably his comfortable range so this I
would want to upgrade but then he goes
on to say one of the best gaming PC's on
Craigslist right now kills 4k games
attaining 60 plus fps and most titles
buttery smooth gameplay an instant load
times I mean I'm not sure about like the
best gaming PC on Craigslist I've
probably seen better pcs on Craigslist
just scrolling through this particular
location but you know when they hype it
up like this it just you don't want to
oversell it right because then people
start wondering what's wrong with it if
it's that great dude why you selling it
oh and by the way this is still an
extremely high asking price he's saying
that his graphics affair with the
waterblock costs $1,400 new on Amazon
I'm not sure if he paid that much or if
he thinks he's gonna get that much out
of it but he's I mean people would have
to be crazy to pay this much money of
this dude for this system all right
here's one from offer up I got a laugh
out of this one someone on Twitter
shared this a thank you to whoever that
was I'm sorry I didn't pay closer
attention but this guy wants seven
hundred and twenty-five dollars Museum
in here seven hundred and twenty-five
bucks for you're reading that right
folks an Rx 488 gig model I mean at
least he's got the hate gig parent here
but 725 bucks check this out he's so
standoffish too if you find it somewhere
else for cheaper go buy it there and
don't waste my time
he already says he's willing to go down
to 650 I don't know why he doesn't just
put 650 in it you know the actual price
box if you're serious about making an
offer contact me bought it in the summer
of 2017 which means that you paid near
MSRP for this card which would have been
around 250 bucks so you want three times
what you paid for the card back after
roughly a year and here's our last one
this is a gaming PC for $2,800 ending on
in good spirits here an i7 8700 K 16
gigs of ram is e 370 board one terabyte
SSD mastercase 5 RGB 650 watt gold plus
EVGA 10:18 and knock this D 15 that's
that giant air-cool you're saying there
he wants so what is this
$2,800 let's do one last price breakdown
then
so i7 8700 K that's about 400 bucks this
is 200 bucks that's $600 or so let's
let's give them 200 bucks for this so
600 that's plus 200 $800 1 terabyte SSD
we'll skip that for now 800 bucks let's
move on to the graphics card okay
graphics card is another maybe 800 bucks
at $1600 a hundred bucks for the cooler
1700 bucks $1,800
let's say $1,900 and then whatever one
terabyte SSD is going for right now so
we still need to make up for roughly 800
to a thousand dollars to come close to
this asking price which mind you is you
know you're paying for use parts here
you're not buying brand-new components
so if you wanted to build this yourself
you actually could spend a lot less than
this in the current market and still
build a comparable PC that this one's
probably not gonna sell at this price
either then again I've been wrong before
about this kind of stuff somebody might
see it and go WOW looks like a really
great deal so folks that is all I have
for this one I tried to throw in more
ads this time and focus less on like
they're really absurd ones just so you
guys can get a feel for the entire
market I went pretty much all across the
states I'm not sure about that one offer
up ad was I think it was la so I went
through Florida I went up to Atlanta I
went up to I want to say it was Virginia
and then we went kind of in the middle
st. Louis area went down south to
Houston Austin areas and in Texas and
then we went to LA and then up to
Seattle I kind of try to follow like
that zigzag path up to the northwest of
the country just to get a feel for all
the prices across the country and it's
pretty consistent what I think I can say
is that the big cities are gonna have
usually the best deals but then again
they might be asking for more because
they're in big cities so you know people
have like this this notion in their head
that they can charge more for a product
because the cost of living is higher in
that area and that might be true to an
extent especially in this market but
nonetheless prices right now on
Craigslist are not doing too well
I'm almost just willing to say that
you're gonna have a better
I'm shopping on eBay because there
you're getting just you know usually
just certain items right you can hunt
for specifically graphics cards and find
a lot more of those offers on a site
like eBay so the chance of you finding a
pretty decent deal are gonna be a lot
higher than on a site like Craigslist
and most people on Craigslist aren't
willing to ship anyway so you're gonna
