first automobiles were invented people
began racing them exhilaration pride
accomplishment fortune they're
synonymous with words like victory with
words like style there came a point when
style began taking root auto
manufacturers were willing to compromise
on aerodynamic and convenient qualities
for the sake of building cars that
looked as great as they ran this ran
true to the insides as well handcrafted
steering wheels complex dashboards and
stitched leather seats
speaking of leather seats what have we
here a gorgeous chair from a kei racing
now it isn't sporting natural leather
but PU or by cast leather which is split
leather covered with a layer of
polyurethane great for keeping things
clean and shiny simply put a chair like
this from a kei racing will transform
your computing and gaming experience it
isn't up for debate really take it from
a guy who's used a kitchen chair to game
in for several years there's something
about sitting in a comfortable well-made
chair like this one it absorbs you it's
soft leather cushions pull you in just
like those of premium four-wheel D
counterparts this one's so good I'm
willing to look past the slightly
slanted stitching the rubberized
armrests and plastic shields it glides
across even carpet unhindered thanks to
its extra lubricated bearings and sturdy
wheels it has one of the best height
adjustment mechanisms I've ever seen
hands down and will stand the test of
time for a price comparable to the other
competitors and the best part just as
you can create and customize the seats
of your luxury car for optimal style and
comfort a K Racing offers more than a
few variants and dozens of color
combinations it's an experience I can't
quite describe via a youtube video which
is why I've resorted to this style but I
can personally guarantee you that
sitting in one of these will not
disappoint I wasn't paid for this review
only sent one of these great chairs to
present to the channel and critique in
any way possible and apart from the few
issues I mentioned earlier I can't find
anything else about which to complain
you can find links to chairs like this
one from a kei racing in this video's
description and so much like the
automobile races of today we've come
full circle
and there is no alternative for
plush seating period no it isn't cheap
but neither is the company you get what
you pay for you don't expect anything
else but the best and a sixteen point
four liter quad turbocharged bugatti
veyron and you shouldn't expect anything
less of a kei racing i've sat and driven
in a few six-figure cars in my lifetime
maybe not seven figures but you get the
point and I can say with certainty that
seats like these would blend right in
don't believe me try one for yourself
this is science studio thanks for
indulging with us
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
