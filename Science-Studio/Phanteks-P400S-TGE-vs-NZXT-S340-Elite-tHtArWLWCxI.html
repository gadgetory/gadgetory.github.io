years ago that the p400 was the best mid
tower case on the market yes even better
than the NZXT s340 but upon the release
of the s340 elite I had to rethink my
decision now in this video we'll be
comparing the two tempered glass
versions each sporting a unique color
scheme on the left the NZXT s340 elite
on the right the fantex p400s tempered
glass edition my conclusions might
disappoint some but after building in
several Matar PC cases this year alone
I've got a pretty good idea of optimal
design it looks however are entirely
subjective so let's start with that
neither of these differ in its original
design and that's a good thing in fact
with the p400s glass window removed
you'd be hard-pressed to find any
difference from its predecessor save the
color scheme the s340 elites newly added
front mounted SSD tray gives its new
name away but that's about it as well
you can currently by the s340 elite in
white and black variants while the p400
tge is offered in a variety of color
combinations something else you're
likely to notice right away between the
two their textures the p400 sports a
glossy Sheen while the s340 elite is
wrapped in a matte finish frame build
quality apart from this difference
though is on point just remember that if
you opt for the white variant of either
of these cases regardless of the texture
finish you will likely scrape up some
paint and reveal that dark frame
interior but apart from this my previous
statement also applies for their
concepts and interior designs both rely
on an open form factor aesthetic which
seems to be the trend nowadays and I
don't mind
but while the NZXT counterpart boasts
its iconic cable routing bridge to the
right of the motherboard tray fantex
includes several storage tray mounting
points you'll have to remove these red
covers to access them we'll talk more
about these a little later on
and while cables can be routed behind
the S 340s bridge which is convenient to
an extent the p400 includes cable
routing cutouts with rubber grommets I
personally prefer the cutouts because it
can easily wrap around my 24 pin whereas
with the bridge it can be difficult to
sculpt the dense wiring around the solid
panel you know what I mean if you
actually build in one for the right of
these areas are the front fan mounts
another area where these differ NZXT
took a form approach limiting the number
of fans the to 120 s or 140 s I've
actually managed to fit a 280 millimeter
AIO and
as well by orienting fans on the front
side but it was cutting it close
this decision undoubtedly gives the
frame of our fluid in cohesive feel but
at the expense of that three hundred and
sixty millimeter radiator support which
is a large arrow to the knee for anyone
looking to cut them cool in this case
which I don't recommend there's not a
lot of room for it when all is said and
done the p400 on the other hand takes a
function approach allowing for a
removable front basement panel in doing
so you'll be able to mount up to a three
hundred sixty millimeter radiator along
with fans and even have extra room for
tube and reservoir support thanks to a
removable hard drive tray down below
it's certainly the more custom loop
friendly of the two this becomes more
apparent when you look at the top of
each case only one 120 or 140 fan will
fit here whereas space for two is
available in the P 400 rad support is
limited either way up top though because
there isn't enough width for the cases
to hold one closer to the less glass
panels now both of these cases do have
basements which I love but with the
modularity upfront aside there are still
a few key differences between the two of
these and in my book the S 340 wins here
two SSD trays can be placed on top
followed by a single one on the side I
think this addition with the elite is
very cool and functional there's also a
cutout for VGA cables the P 400 lacks
both SSD and VGA routing support via its
basement making it more of a forum
aspect than anything else but at least
it still has one to the back of each
you'll find a few cutouts for HD audio
and USB cables front diode cetera you
get an extra with the P 400 but each is
much narrower than the s3 40 equivalent
so these balance out the backs of both
of these cases are very similar saved to
qualities and that's fan support as well
as PSU mounting starting with the latter
both only support one 20s but fantex
included vertical adjustment while NZXT
chose a fixed design not necessarily a
nail-biter of a difference but it is
still there for the PSU fan text opted
for the mainstream mounting design PSU
insertion from the right side I'll NZXT
opted for rear mounting aided by a
dedicated bracket and I much prefer this
option
it makes the build process move by much
smoother and also looks a bit more
dynamic back here despite not being able
to see it other subtle differences carry
over to the right sides of each
sighing their motherboard trays the p400
sports two semi toolless SSD trays to
make up for what's missing up front
remember NZXT decided to place its trays
atop the basement either way you've got
support in creative locations
additionally fantex included several
velcro straps to keep cables and check
ins exe added plastic clips instead to
take advantage of the extra volume
created by the cable bridge but while
this may appear to be the better option
on paper and this is where i'm sure a
few of you will disagree with me the
bridge takes away from reservoir support
and also isolates itself from a book of
the cables at the end of the day while
it may look clean now most of these
smaller cables will have to be routed
elsewhere thanks to the inclusion of a
24 pin USB 3.0 SATA cables you know it
adds up and because these clips can't be
tightened you risk having a cable or to
poke out from behind the bridge don't
get me wrong I like the idea I even like
the implementation to an extent it's not
something I would take away but it is
something I would swap for upper
grommets the cutout exposes the backside
of the case where cables often go astray
I feel as though NZXT was shooting more
for a function trait more than anything
but it ended up just being some
aesthetic thing that they left as an
icon for the s340 series it's unique and
works to a degree but it will crush your
24-pin especially if it's custom braided
and expose the rat's nest behind most
builds now to knock on the p400 a bit I
get the idea behind the removable hard
drive trays above the basement to cool
idea but poorly implemented not because
of how anything looks I like the design
and color integration but let's be
honest it makes no sense in a case like
this no one buys a fan text p400 to
stuff six hard drives into it this is a
mid Tower and I'd much rather see the
space utilized in some other unique way
I'll leave the rest of that up to the
fan techs design team but alas there are
a few very tiny traits that still end up
pushing the p400 tge are you ready for
this just a bit ahead of the s340 elite
this exact same thing that happened last
time around and why the p400 won my
wallet then the most obvious of these is
the integrated RGB lighting and I know
that that's been overused a bit but the
p400 does this in a subtle way a very
good way the top of the case reveals
this as well you see the NC XPS 340
elite boasts the usual headers plus VR
leads cool only if you have
graphics card with a dedicated HDMI port
somewhere other than the rear the p400
on the other hand scraps this quality
for a more functional approach fan RGB
and reset controllers under the front of
the top panel you'll find three
dedicated buttons two of which control
fan speed via a 3-way splitter and LED
color you also get an RGB LED strip
throughout anywhere you please the reset
switch well resets the PC but it's still
cool to have I enjoy the looks of the p4
hundreds not only for their minimalistic
designs which as 340s also support quite
well mind you but also for their
seamless RGB integration something that
NZXT has yet to do with their s340
lineup the power button cycles through
the same colors that the included strip
does and there's even a small LED strip
at the bottom of the case to illuminate
the logo and it also changes colors
these are subtle qualities but enough to
make p400s pop just ask any owner now
obviously your conclusions are entirely
your own and justified in your own minds
and I highly doubt that I convinced any
s340 elite owner out there that their
case is now inferior to the p400s tge
I get that but if you ask me today which
case I prefer it's the P 400ft GE and
for a few different reasons and it's not
necessarily going to make sense for
everybody I get that but for my
preferences and what I look for in a mid
tower case the p400s takes the cake
it wasn't an easy decision and I'm
certain I'll build in s340 s in the
future I love the way they look and how
easy they are in which to build but the
P 400 takes these traits a tad bit
further and adds a few of its own also
the way everything is so modular makes
customization and cooling integration
that much more available just look at
how easy the front panel was to remove
compared to the s3 40s I won't look down
on you for choosing the s3 40 elite over
the P 400 tge but I might ask why is it
the style the color option price course
these are all preferential and that's
why nothing I say is set in stone but in
my book fantex squeaked out a very
narrow win very very narrow what do you
think give this one a thumbs up you got
a cool thumbs down for the opposite
click to subscribe but if you haven't
already
now we'll catch you in the next video I
wanted to save this announcement I'm
about to make for last because I know
most of you usually turn off the video
by this point you know right we start
seeing the thumbs up thing go up you
just you're like okay
next video so I will be building in the
p400s there's a reason why I didn't
build a knight in these cases for the
video but I'll be putting a custom loop
together inside the p400s very very soon
like within the next week or so so stay
tuned for that of course it will be a
risin being build because red is risin
and I'm basically pretty pretty dope
this is Salazar studio thanks for
learning with us
can't believe I just use the word dope
in a sentence on YouTube</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
