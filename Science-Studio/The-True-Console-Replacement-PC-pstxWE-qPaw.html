with science studio so I want to cut
right to it I understand that there is a
huge console gaming fan base I
understand I was a part of it for a long
time in fact only just over a year ago I
recently converted to PC gaming I do not
intend for this video to step on any of
your toes so if you are a console over
out there by all means continue playing
consoles there is nothing wrong with
that this video is more for somebody who
I don't know I guess sees the potential
to kind of unify the computing
experience with the gaming experience
and that is essentially what a gaming PC
does and so when I realized that I began
kind of studying and learning about
computers and how to build them and
that's what led to ultimately this third
or this is a fourth build I think of
mine and this is my daily driver this is
actually what I added on to believe it
or not I don't know if any of you know
that I actually edit all of my videos
with this little Intel i3 6100 yeah and
it does quite well I'll upload a video
later on if you guys want detailing how
well the processor does render videos
and handle the editing process in Adobe
Premiere and whatnot so if you want to
see something like that let me know in
the comments below but otherwise there
to get right to it but I want to do I
have my little tablet here and I have
all my notes and what I want to talk
about address what I want to do first is
kind of outline the console benefits
that is what makes a gaming console
obviously the gaming console what makes
a console better than a PC in particular
gaming PC so what I wrote down first off
was that they were smaller and obviously
this is true for most most consoles out
there they tend to run with a smaller
form factor than a general PC this thing
behind me here is probably four times
larger than an Xbox one and about six
times larger than a ps4 so that's one
thing that the console definitely has
going for it the second would be that it
consumes less power
now obviously a computer like this is
going to step all over a console at
least in this generation the current ps4
Xbox one generation but that's not
really the point of a
console console is not supposed to be
able to do all the things that this can
do for the most part they're gonna be
quieter and they'll consume less power
that's another note I wrote on here
they're more mainstream I would say the
chances of finding somebody who plays a
console at least a Playstation or Xbox
console on a regular basis are higher
chances are higher than finding somebody
who tends to game on a PC now PC gaming
is becoming more and more popular there
are tons of YouTube channels centered
around specifically gaming on PCs but
the odds of finding somebody who does
happen to game on a PC regularly are
fairly slim compared to the odds of
finding somebody place console so that's
the third point I made and then the
fourth one it's probably the most
important and it's the fact that it's
much cheaper so a ps4 or an Xbox one
that you know it's bundled nicely you
know you get the console and you get the
controller maybe get a game or two and
connect whatnot
it's gonna run you about $350 so you
might find some pretty good sales maybe
a refurbished one or if you found one on
Black Friday for around 300 bucks and
yeah you made out quite well but for the
sake of this video we're going to assume
that a next-gen console that is the most
recent console generation that has been
released which will include the ps4 and
Xbox one will cost around $350 so $350
will be our target for the PC that we're
going to build to rival the ps4 and Xbox
one so that's the point I wanted to make
here while consoles generally do have
these gonna kind of bouncing it's a cool
chair I don't know the bun joke chair
they're not sponsoring this video but I
wish somebody would I want to address
the fact that just because consoles have
these these qualities over most pcs that
doesn't mean they have to have these
qualities over all pcs and what we're
gonna do is build a PC that will trump a
console hopefully and we'll stay within
the bounds of a console budget will be
as small as a console will be as
power-efficient roughly as a console and
maybe one day be as mainstream as
console mainstream as it made its team
or something like that mainstream so
let's see what we can do let me get this
out of the way first and foremost I
wrote a whole paragraph on just this one
particular point because I want to
address this before we dive into the
parts which are coming up very shortly
stay tuned for that and that's the fact
that there are several videos across
YouTube claiming to have you know built
the ultimate console killer PC and
honestly most of them do perform better
than the next box one and ps4 but one
thing is that the prices of the PCs that
they build are around $400 $500 in some
cases and kids that you know on a $300
budget they're trying to get their
parents to pay for a console are
probably not gonna convince their
parents to spend an extra 200 dollars on
the PC that they probably won't use for
anything else other than games anyway so
the price issue is is always there and I
don't like the fact that they don't
stick to just the 300 or 350 dollar
budget I know it's tough to do that
you'll see how tough it is for us as
well and the compromises that we will
have to make but if you're gonna build a
console killer it's gotta match the
console and almost every way except for
the fact that it's a PC and uh you know
just a gaming system Xbox would argue
that their social kind of like a
platform is more than just gaming but we
all know what we do on Xbox one is just
gaming and Netflix again and I know and
the other thing is that these these some
gaming cases that console killer
builders used to put their parts in are
in my opinion just ugly I honestly I
just I do not like the whole cube form
factor well why on earth would I want to
have a cube on my desk
I would rather something in this big
than a cube do I have to you know
explain to somebody that's actually a PC
know if the keep is a window in it okay
yeah that's pretty cool but in most
cases these cheap ITX cases are in most
cases these cases are just ugly I don't
like them at all so that's something
else we're gonna tackle with this build
here and you'll see that toward the end
of the videos so if you're super super
impatient and
see what ix case we use go ahead and
click the link here and it will take you
straight to that part just promise me
that you'll rewind a bit so that you can
see the other parts of the build that we
used so first things first we need to
figure out just how powerful a next-gen
console is and in this case we decided
to go with the ps4 specs to kind of
match with our computer specs only
because the ps4 has no it's a bit more
powerful let's just just take more
there's a bunch of different reasons why
but the ps4 is slightly more powerful in
terms of its specifications than the
Xbox one so I'm sorry if that enrages
some of you Microsoft fans but the ps4
is it's just more powerful that's just a
fact okay I will post links in the
description that detail everything that
has to do with that so if you don't
agree with me or if you you want to look
more into that click those links and
they're in the description I made sure
to all-caps them so you can find them
down there
here are the specifications for the ps4
I'm gonna read these straight up because
I don't want to get these wrong and I
want you guys to get the facts the ps4
features a single chip low-power
processor based on AMD architecture it's
an 8 core processor 64 bit and runs on a
board similar to an ITX PC board the APU
which is essentially a CPU and GPU
combined is capable of computing 1.8 for
teraflops of floating points per second
now a teraflop is just a unit of measure
for computing a GPU speed and
performance that's really all you need
to know about that so generally the more
teraflops of floating points that it can
compute per second the more powerful the
card that's not always the case but in
most cases that is true
so we've quickly concluded here in
studio that we were going to have to
resort to an APU there was just no way
around it and I say APU because that's
it that's all we're going to have we're
not gonna have a GPU with it we simply
cannot afford to include a GPU in order
to match the price of a ps4 or Xbox one
so I'm sorry but if you want to build a
PC that is identical to a console you
will have to forego the separate
graphics card all together and just
purchase an APU
so that's what we did we decided to go
with the AMD
a 1070 700 K this is a Kaveri APU so
what this means is that it has four cpu
computing cores and six I can't hold up
six but five plus one graphics
processing cores so it's essentially a
ten core processor but really it's only
a quad-core processor processor and then
just a hexa core GPU so I mean most GPUs
are like Multi multi core so six cores
really isn't all that phenomenal now the
ps4 is a core processor dedicates six of
its cores to graphics and the other two
to just basic computing within like the
home screen and whatnot so we're going
to have the same amount of graphics
processing cores and then we'll have an
additional two just kind of central
processing cores so we have two more
cores altogether but we're gonna have
the same limb for graphics processing
board that's that's really all you need
to know about that
so the 810 7700 K will allow us a
moderate overclock let's say around 4.0
gigahertz that's that's pretty easy to
do it's based on the FM 2 plus socket so
we're going to need an FM 2 + socket
motherboard so that's what made us
choose the Omega this right here it's
the MSI a 68 HIA CF + 2 + board now it's
got reputable features the most
important one I believe other than the
fact that it actually supports the
processor and has like you know RAM
slots and whatnot is it as built in
Wi-Fi
you know the ps4 and the Xbox one both
have built in Wi-Fi and I believe that
is something that distinguishes consoles
from most pcs so without having to know
spend extra money on a separate Wi-Fi
card our 868 h:i has Wi-Fi built in
that's pivotal in my opinion and I
wanted to make sure that I chose an ITX
board that had that feature so that no
one can say oh well your board
you know doesn't have Wi-Fi so therefore
you're not a concept well boom sorry
about that but we're pretty pretty on
par with consoles at this point anyway
it also has HDMI DVI and analog display
outs and whatnot because our CPU is also
a GPU so you know onboard graphics is
obviously supported has a single PCI
Express 3.0 Lane you know that's all
we'll need anyway because when I didn't
have a graphics card but if you wanted
to add a graphics card later for
whatever reason it wouldn't be a problem
to do so so there's that sense of
upgrade ability there that's pretty cool
and the board also has two memory slots
for ddr3 somebody takes boards only have
like one dim slot that's kind of weird I
don't really like that why not just add
a second line there make a little more
room but this board does have two slots
so you will be able to run things in
dual channel little channel notes that's
pretty cool and the board will panel up
to 2133 megahertz ram it's also pretty
cool a little side note if you happen to
purchase Ram that is just clocked at a
higher speed than what your motherboard
is rated at all you have to do is go
into your BIOS and then change your
memory speech whatever the highest rated
value that your motherboard can support
and that's it you're good as bolt so no
problem there as long as you have a BIOS
that's actually you know friendly now in
the case of the ps4 that PS were
actually has 8 gigabytes of gddr5 gddr5
meaning that it's graphics face it's
just sold in use for graphics but
getting like weird popups and stuff in
our case obviously because we're going
to be making this a legit PC we're going
to need your standard ddr3 and and in
this case we decided to go with just 2 4
gigabyte sticks of course their
vengeance 1680 ddr3 dimms they're going
for 35 bucks on Newegg that's not bad at
all I would say there were you know
there were options a while ago that were
a bit cheaper but you know 35 bucks is
pretty solid for d2i 3 at this point so
I will jump on those now for the power
supply ok both the ps4 and the Xbox one
under full load draw at the most about
200 watts of power and you notice that
the little power bricks that you plug
into your consoles are rated at around
150 to 200 watts usually
and our system is probably not going to
draw any more than 200 watts anyway but
we want the path for upgradability to be
rather easy to you know walk on that was
a terrible analogy so what we did
basically was opt for a full ATX power
supply the PSU is just a it's just a 430
watt EVGA any plus certified power
supply it's not modular or anything like
that but it's it's pretty slim it's not
like to you know wide or anything and it
should fit in our case just fine and it
will allow for an easy upgradability
path if you decided to add a GPU in the
future at least a GPU that's like not
super super power hungry or anything
like that
now as far as storage is concerned the
ps4 and the Xbox one both offer
different storage variants but we're
just going to assume that the consoles
offer just the standard 500 gigabytes of
storage I know that the ps1 and Xbox for
weight then I send it backward pocket I
know that the ps4 and the Xbox one offer
like 1 terabyte variants and maybe even
more than that I have no idea at this
point but 500 gigabytes is plenty in
most cases we basically scavenge Newegg
and Amazon to find a 500 gigabyte hard
drive we found one that was a Western
Digital blue caviar blue and just 500
gigs it's a hard disk drive not cookie a
solid-state drive but if you're somebody
who prefers speed and all that you know
which I personally prefer not that the
constants off of that I would just go
for the SSD but in this case we're just
gonna count the 500k by a hard drive and
we found a Western Digital caviar blue
which was great I wanted to show you
guys I picked up this this Western
Digital caviar blue 320 gig hard drive
about five years ago from Best Buy
actually in town where I'm at now and I
still use this thing in in that I mean I
still I use this in there for like
general like storage for games and
whatnot it's a very reliable brand if
you have any doubts about Western
Digital but you shouldn't anyway but if
you had any take my word for it these
things are super reliable they're gonna
be more reliable than Toshiba or even
other brands so go Western Digital even
if it cost you five or ten bucks more go
Western Digital so that's what we went
with this one cost about thirty bucks so
that's it for parts actually inside the
case we don't have to worry about a CPU
cooler because our APU does have a fan
kit included with the purchase of the
processor and it should handle the
overclock it may be a bit loud but it's
gonna handle the overclock just fine so
wow we've uh we've actually managed to
keep the price within reason I'm
actually surprised about this too I mean
this is like the first time I've
actually gone over everything the total
price for this build is almost right at
$300 so right away we're pretty much
like under budget for a console at least
that's pretty awesome now we have
something to put these things in and I
promise you that the case we chose would
look pretty sick at least in my opinion
I know people are like super picky I'm
super picky too this case may not be up
your alley at all but we found a pretty
cool-looking one it was slim and it had
pretty sweet little colors on it and all
that
it's called azza or awesome is it as a
awesome I don't okay a zz a it's a CSA Z
- one with three black mini ITX case but
wow this thing will stand out it looks
like a console to an extent it sits
vertically that's pretty cool I like
vertically sittin consoles I just think
they look better than the ones that lay
down because then it just looks like a
VCR or whatever but it stands up and
it's got there's no neon green accents
you can see on it that's pretty awesome
I think it's very cool it will fit our
ATX power supply no problem it will fit
to 3.5 inch hard disk drives no problem
and has support for like a little mini
optical drive if you want to include one
of those and it does have support for a
dual slot extended graphics card so if
you wanted to add the graphics card in
the future it does support that it has a
little like a cable that adapts from the
PCI Express sport to let your video card
kind of sit I don't know vertically
instead of horizontally or vice versa I
don't know which one anyway your your
video card will sit
90 degrees perpendicular to what usually
would sit at in a case like this yeah
it's just a cool design all around I
actually really like it but if you don't
like it if you're not a fan of the black
and green color scheme blah L means pain
thing I mean paint it whatever you want
if you want to check out this video here
we painted a lot of stuff in our PC
using white plastidip and you could
certainly do that with this case out
here Plasti Dip is my preferred method
for painting if you want to call it
paint because have one it's durable and
two it's like super easy to remove so if
you ever want to return anything just
peels right off it's pretty awesome and
going back to the case itself it only
constantly fifty bucks
after a $20 mail in rebate from new egg
so yeah fifty bucks for this case like
that's that's a pretty good price most
ITX cases are a little more than that or
like really really cheap like this cube
it was talking about I know it's a new
brand it's kind of sketchy buying a
brand that you've never probably heard
of before but it has received great
reviews and great feedback from the tech
community at least on new egg so you
know if you end up not liking it you can
blame those guys on me because I'm just
going off of what they said so okay now
to be fair the Xbox one and the ps4 also
have like a gamepad included to play on
you like the ps4 controller or the Xbox
one controller I actually use that to
game on as my xbox one controller the
one that I had before I sold the console
so um I guess an equivalent to that
would be a keyboard and mouse and you
can pick up one on you a kit so it's a
nice Logitech keyboard mouse combo not
bad at all for $15
so let's tack that onto our total price
and wow that is pretty good come on
that's that's a pretty good price three
hundred sixty-five dollars for a PC that
is also kind of a console that doesn't
play console games like don't play ps4
Xbox one games in this thing if you buy
an optical drive it's not gonna work and
you'll have to use steam or whatever
else to play your video games on but for
365 dollars I'd say it's a pretty dang
good deal I mean really come on like 365
bucks that will literally get you a
Piet's for maybe like one game when you
can go on Steam and take advantage of
like their winter sale right now
purchase games for like 20 bucks that
would otherwise
forty or sixty dollars in the GameStop
store but something like this is not
going to be powerful enough for me and
it may not be powerful enough for you
but you have to keep in mind that ps4
and Xbox one games are designed
specifically to extract the most
performance out of their respective ap
use so a ps4 game is designed completely
around the architecture of their Jaguar
eight core APU ok the games we're gonna
play on Steam with this little I don't
know console killer PC are not going to
be optimized specifically for this 7700
K so keep that in mind you may have to
dumb down the settings a bit if you're
looking to play games on 1080p good luck
you're gonna have to really turn things
down if you want to see like 30 to 40
fps and games so without further ado
represent to you the as a console killer
PC yeah I don't know if you're into
something more ITX form factor ish then
this could be for you especially if
you're currently a console gamer and
you're looking to make the transition
steadily from a console to a PC this
might be right up your alley as well so
I understand that some of you may not
approve this computer at all and you may
think it's complete crap and a lot of
you probably are right when you say that
especially when you compare it to say
like the computers that you're using
right now to watch this video on but hey
you gotta start somewhere and I say that
this new guy deserves a few kudos for
looking so stylish and being so closely
related to a ps4 if you want to stay
within the confines of the ps4 s
aesthetics or the Xbox ones aesthetics
in this case I'd say that looks a little
more like an Xbox one than a ps4 and the
performance power and price of a console
then I'd say this thing is for you now
you're probably gonna find things in the
future especially if you're watching
this video like a month or two after
it's already been published to youtube
there will probably be price dips it'll
make this thing even cheaper so maybe in
the future you'll be able to add a
separate graphics cards to the system
and still get around the same total
price but until that happens yeah
we'll be yeah seems like a pretty good
deal to me what do you think cricket if
you liked the video leave a thumbs up we
appreciate everything that you get but
we also appreciate everything's down you
get so if you thought this video was
straight crap let us know and also let
us know what we can do to improve our
videos be sure to subscribe for more and
leave a comment suggesting future videos
if you want to see certain things being
compared I know that a lot of you have
been asking for the i5 4460 versi 360
100 comparison I am currently working on
that please be patient with me I promise
I will have that video uploaded shortly
I'm just trying to get hold of an i5
4460 mmm I'm a poor college student so
it's kind of difficult but it will come
just be patient I appreciate the support
I appreciate all the views on all the
videos and the subscriptions you guys
are awesome I will continue doing these
that's pretty much everything I wrote
down so this is science studio thanks
for learning with us
