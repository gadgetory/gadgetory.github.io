disclosing the fact that I've been using
the mate book X Pro from Huawei yeah I
know it's kind of a weird name as my
daily driver for just over two weeks now
to replace my 13 inch of MacBook Pro
base model to the 2017 edition as you'll
find it compared to the mate book in
almost every single way in this video I
think the juxtaposition is a fair one
though because they're not only
equitable in terms of price but they're
like copies of each other well I should
say hawawa copied Apple when it comes to
the design but they definitely improved
many things across the board and we'll
talk about those in this video so here
it goes
the huawei mate book X Pro review now at
first glance you might be thinking okay
yeah they definitely ripped off the
MacBooks design here the dimensions of
both are nearly identical I'm talking
length width height whatever you want to
look at slim foe speaker grilles
surround the keyboards there are even
two USB C ports on the left side of each
granted only one on the mate books is a
Thunderbolt 3 and chargeable but what
makes the mate book truly great are its
improvements elsewhere in the design and
function of the laptop for instance it's
difficult to overlook this beautiful
nearly bezel as display capable of up to
450 nits it rivals the brightness of the
MacBook the color gamut here is also
pretty incredible not quite on par with
the Mac books in terms of Adobe RGB but
nearly 100% srgb I noticed neither
oversaturation nor backlight bleed and
the 3000 by 2000 resolution brings with
the DES pixel density of 259 a clear
step up from the 2560 by 1600 13.3 inch
227 PPI density of the Retina display
with these dimensions comes a slightly
taller aspect ratio for the mate book
than traditional sixteen by nine you'll
find a three by two here meaning you'll
see black bars and pretty much any
widescreen video you watch I'm more than
welcome the extra real estate you don't
have black bars when you're surfing the
web when you're content creating and I'm
fine with that other aspect to the
screen are satisfactory as well the LTPS
technology yields excellent viewing
angles in a decent contrast ratio oh and
did I mention it's also yeah a
touchscreen and that's something the Mac
books have never had this is a clear
step up from the 13-inch retina panel in
every regard that I can think of so a
great job while wait with this display
but a near bezel us form comes with
quirky function you know what I'm
talking about here the camera right
where is it you ask is it here nope is
it here no is it what Dell does with the
XPS 13 is it down here somewhere the
answers still no it's actually right
here in the keyboard that's right a
click release key of sorts hides an
upward facing one megapixel sensor with
of course terrible low-light performance
as you might expect along with putrid
and viewing angles I'm not even sure
this really qualifies as 720p not that
the MacBooks is any better it's just
it's so sad to see a MacBook Pro with
such a terrible camera but now that who
always also doing it I really can't talk
the MacBook any more for it this is a
test of both of the camera quality as
well as the mic sensitivity and quality
I'm about two feet or so away from the
screen and of course I'm looking down at
the camera because it is below
everything above it so if you want to
look at content on screen this is what
it will look like to someone watching
you on camera your eyes are going to be
so you definitely higher than the person
that you're actually trying to talk to
via the camera but a convenience factor
associated with always take is that it
can be securely stowed into the keyboard
tray meaning that you don't have to
worry about unwanted spies snooping in
on well whatever you happen to be doing
no more tape tinfoil hat wears now fit
in all seriousness cam hacking is a
serious and a real thing it's happened
before many times and this design
mitigates the issue altogether so all in
all I would trade optimal camera
placement for extra screen real estate
and this cameras no function any day of
the week I also enjoy watching companies
tackle the camera placement issue in
different ways this is by far the most
unique I've seen in an ultrabook more on
the build quality it's very similar and
feel to the MacBook surrounded by solid
aluminum on all corners although the
mate books feel is just a bit smoother
so the MacBooks has a more rough
aluminum texture this one might be a bit
more slippery just something to keep in
mind chamfered edges make the mate book
look pretty majestic AF in my opinion
and the sturdy hinge is still subtle
enough to be open with one finger and it
actually won't wobble too much either
when being pressed with a finger
remember this is a touch panel I hate
this about other laptops in the elder
book category they always seem to wobble
whenever you push it this one of course
if you give it some force is gonna do
that but I don't think that it's a major
concern if you're just kind of you know
tapping something or sliding up and down
you're not gonna have too much wobble at
all I do find the trackpad a bit lacking
though definitely a downgrade from the
math book though any laptop is going to
be a downgrade from the MacBook in terms
of the trackpad if anyone's doing it
right it's Apple in this regard I'm not
gonna dock them for it at all so the two
physical buttons on the mate books
touch pad here on the bottom left and
right side are a bit loud and difficult
to push though you could just tap with
your finger instead I'll be it without
any physical feedback and I think that's
the part that I miss the most with this
little haptic engine here on the MacBook
you feel it wherever you push just
because of the motor embedded into the
touchpad itself other than that the mate
books is pretty large taking full
advantage of the gap beneath the
keyboard and it is fairly precise it'll
you know detect even the smallest of
movements with your finger by the way
don't confuse the mate book X with the
mate book X Pro you want the pro model
but there are two versions the i-5 in
the i7 and you want the i7 Pro model
specifically we'll discuss why here
shortly but next let's talk about the
mate book keyboard now you're probably
assuming it'll be difficult to adjust to
thanks to the slim profile yet only
MacBooks really suffer the fatal key
switch flaw thanks to that butterfly
design which really wasn't corrected the
second time around third time around
supposedly fixes the issue but this
laptop here does not have third gen
butterfly switches we're still on 2nd
gen and that's a huge problem because
Apple actually doesn't even fix the
issue by you know implementing a 3rd gen
switch when you send it in for repair if
something stops working it's all
discussed in this video right here by
the way if you're more interested now
fortunately the mate book X Pro though
copying much of Apple's design to you
stayed away from such a dangerous which
is in favor of more traditional mushy
keys I know it sounds weird to promote
such a bland tactile feedback because
there's almost literally none in this
chiclet style keyboard especially when
it's in the context of mechanicals right
but for an ultrabook
I'd put this on par with maybe like a
Dell XPS 13 they aren't great but
they're better than what you'd expect
from this form factor and that's all I'm
really worried about they also won't
break on you three months into use so
there's that
another cool feature just above the
keyboard is a fingerprint scanner and
it's embedded into the power button it's
fast with Windows hello and much easier
than chugging a pin or password just
takes a bit of getting used to pushing
the button versus typing in a pin if
that's what you've been doing for the
longest time less than a second of whole
time even while sleeping and you'll be
signed in automatically up next I want
to discuss drive speeds this i7 unit
comes equipped by default with a 512
gigabyte pcie-based in VME SSD these
reads and writes almost line up with
this thing screen resolution oddly
enough so a blazing fast 3 gigabytes per
second or 3,000 megabytes per second for
reads two-ish tuition gigabytes for
writes you'll find that it competes
almost neck-and-neck actually with the
macbook counterpart and i've really
never had anything bad to say about
modern Apple drives Windows loads from a
cold boot in about 8 seconds
games fire up instantly and best of all
no unwarranted harddrive noise which is
not something you should expect anyway
the most ultra books I recommend by the
way opting for the higher tier storage
model not just for the i7 and GPU half a
terabyte is kind of a bare minimum I
would recommend for a laptop of this
calibre any less and you may find
yourself upgrading drives in the future
at which point should've gone with a
larger Drive to begin with right and
saved yourself the hassle of
transferring the operating system
important files yeah it can be a mess
sometimes now on to other relevant
internal specs starting first with the
CPU this is the Intel Core i7 8550 you a
KB Lake are quad core packing a 15 watt
TDP and boost clock of 4 gigahertz it
should be noted that this turbo
frequency is rarely attained though
under intense workloads daring Adobe
Premiere workloads for example average
core frequencies level off around 3
gigahertz instead and it's still not bad
though for a quad core hyper-threaded
ultra-low power chip now the performance
Department this thing actually excels a
score of 529 in Cinebench is a huge step
up from the lowly dual core i7 ultra low
power CPUs from days past that's what's
in this macbook by the way they did step
it up recently but still no discrete
graphics and that's a deal breaker for
me geek bench scores reveal strong
single core performers despite reduced
clock speeds under load and a modest
multi-core score thanks in large part to
hyper threading in this scenario this
translates to solid debris from your pro
renders which when paired with the MX
150 which I'll talk about a second
amount to a respectable
ten minutes for a five-minute 4k video
file I'm not even joking 10 minutes with
this machine here that is unheard of
most ultrabooks take 30 40 minutes to
render a five-minute 4k video file at
about 40 megabits per second so this is
incredible we aren't even far off the
mark of lower and desktop grade CPUs
with much higher TDPS
our kilise hill here is definitely the
small chassis and the thermal
limitations associated with it but if
portability is a top priority that's
what an ultra is for then this one is
one of the best in the business now
let's move on to the MX 115 NVIDIA GPU
included in the i7 variant of the mate
book X Pro it's the one I'd advise you
buy for only a couple hundred USD more
than the eight gig i5 model without
discrete graphics that's a deal-breaker
again I recommend the d GPU it's a huge
step up in almost every regard the MX
150 packs a heck of a punch in such a
small form factor nearly doubling the
OpenCL performance of the i7s integrated
uhd 620 graphics according to our
Geekbench runs in fact watching these
two GPUs tag team via quick sync in
Premiere Pro is a pretty phenomenal
process partly explaining our low render
times we saw earlier the MX 150 can game
- now none of the native resolution
obviously but modestly with 1080p in low
settings I'm talking specifically about
pub G here which isn't buttery smooth
from an optimization standpoint anyway
we're looking at anywhere between 35 and
50 fps in the very low preset at a
resolution slightly higher than 1080p
actually because we have a three by two
aspect ratio it's 1920 by 1200 if we
don't want the stretched image but if
you're more into fortnight let's say
that may pick X Pro still turns out just
under 60 fps on average again these are
incredible numbers relatively speaking
but watching a laptop the size of a
13-inch MacBook Pro turn out playable
frame rates and modern battle royale
titles is pretty incredible if you ask
me now temperatures across the board
were also fantastic to my surprise the
fans kick on fairly early but they
aren't loud by any means go ahead and
have a listen
so yeah definitely quieter than some of
the beefy gaming laptops on the market
do keep in mind though that this GPU
only sports two gigs of beer amps so
bumping inium settings and soccer titles
will be a challenge that's assuming that
your GPU though isn't already the
bottleneck which in most cases will be
the case now a few other things I'd like
to briefly mention battery life is
excellent emitting around nine hours of
my use which is pretty heavy and about
10 hours when playing back 4k Netflix at
50% brightness that's also really
incredible for a laptop of the size
these speakers also sound great there
are four of them two against the
keyboard edges along with two larger
ones down below the range is excellent
sounds are undistorted all the way up to
max volume and the bass is very present
go ahead and have a listen to these
not as much of a kick as the MacBooks
which I think are still the best if you
listen to them in person is the
difficult to kind of translate this
across a microphone the macbook sound a
bit clearer but the netbook x pro
speakers get significantly louder so if
that's a concern to you this one is
definitely the louder one of the two and
again at minimal Distortion so these are
actually pretty high quality speakers in
a laptop again in this size I also
failed to mention the ultimate selling
point for the may pick X Pro USB type-a
that's right we actually get a single
type a port on the right side of the
chassis
there's barely enough space for it but
Huawei made it work with this you can
connect to gaming mice wired headsets
following this pretty much anything that
isn't super new so the things I love
about this laptop just to recap here the
great screen discrete graphics embedded
and the slim profile things I think are
kind of math not deal-breakers but
things I'd like to see improve in the
future the camera exactly down here the
keyboard and the trackpad I wouldn't say
they're deal-breakers again just things
that do need improvement now for my
workloads the may pick X Pro is just a
massive jump in the right direction
especially when compared to them to the
MacBook 13-inch model I've been using
Final Cut Pro with a MacBook and it's
very well optimized for this software
for Mac OS but again you can only get it
on Mac OS and that's a compromise for
quite a number of people out there if
you're interested in Adobe Premiere Pro
more like solid rendering on Windows 10
which is used by quite a number of
people and I think this is one of the
best ultrabooks in its class hands down
it's about 1500 bucks but I would choose
this over like a Dell XPS 15 for around
the same price because it does come with
a 10 X 150 and that makes a world of a
difference you can find this product
link down below along with a few other
ultrabooks kind of similar to this one I
know Asus has an ultrabook with a
discrete chip in it but I'd like the
build quality of this one better I like
the screen better on this one and you
get the 512 gig SSD right the 16 gigs of
ram by default with this model so now I
want to hear from you guys in the
comments down below if you think that
the huawei mate book X Pro is a step in
the right direction for ultrabooks let
us know if you disagree with anything
I've said in this video maybe the
opinions expressed based on some of the
specs that we've listed then let's duke
it out i'm
before that right I know that Apple
fanboys are gonna creep their way into
here and I'm sure they're gonna have
things to say about the Huawei being on
and all its solid coffee nobody can do
things better than Apple that's why they
copied them blah blah blah but whatever
ultimately Huawei has improved what
Apple should have already improved in
their MacBook 13-inch models and they've
managed to cram a discreet GP when
you're at the same time again an
infinity edge display almost from like
you know similar to what Delta's with
the XPS 13 s discrete chip mediocre
trackpad a weird camera placement
excellent battery life a price is
comparable to a MacBook 13-inch model
that's significantly weaker in many
respects it's hard to bargain with an
Apple laptop when you have this in your
corner so if this video a thumbs-up if
you thought it was cool dislike it if
you like umm but opposite or if you hate
everything about life you guys can click
that red subscribe button if you feel
like getting fancy with it you can also
sponsor us or join that's basically your
way of like paying us money I don't know
what you kids gonna call it eventually
but it's gonna change from sponsor to
something else soon if you're already a
sponsor and you want to keep sponsoring
us don't worry about it nothing will
change on your end you'll still get the
icons the badges of sport and live
streams and what have you anyway thanks
for that support
this is sign studio thanks for learning
