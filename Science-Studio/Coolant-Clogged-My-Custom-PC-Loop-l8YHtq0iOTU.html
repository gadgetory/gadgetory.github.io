about 30 minutes ago only to realize
that my microphone was off so I had a
long but productive night I had to
disassemble everything in project blue
sky down to the water blocks down to the
radiators and everything I stripped
everything out except for the hardware
that's not being water-cooled and that's
because the coolant that I originally
put in there thermaltake see 1000 opaque
fluid did not fare well with the
components in my loop now I cannot say
with 100% certainty that it was the
fluid itself it may have just been a
component in my loop that wasn't
properly cleaned find that hard to
believe though because I flushed
everything I flushed the radiators the
first day that I got them clean all the
tubes cleaning GPU blocks
there's nothing else in the loop I mean
the reservoir is fine the pump was fine
so what else could it have been I also
didn't add anything to the fluid if I
said that already but I didn't add
anything else to it it was just C 1000
fluid that was in the loop and it would
separate I mean look at the bottle this
is the bottle that it shifts in and the
fluids already separating in that so it
was just it was just behaving weird and
I noticed when I came back to my weekend
holiday that everything in the loop was
just you know two-sided there was really
light fluid at the bottom and really
dark fluid up top again I can't say what
happened chemically I don't I don't know
I just don't but what I do want to tell
you is that if you're looking to buy the
same kind of cooling that I did that you
should be very weary if you're already
using it you're using different
components that's good to hear you know
it might just be that it's reacting with
the radiators an optical radiators are
known to be pretty dirty anyway even if
you do flush them a few times you still
might not get everything out so that's
the possibility but it's a very visit
it's just it's likely not what's going
on here
and when you can see the fluid
separating in its own bottle I notice
they'll take fluid that you might think
that's normal but it's not something
that you want to see in fluid that
you're about to put through a bunch of
hardware in a PC I mean look at how
disgusting just the GPU block was I had
to tear this thing down to the fins
because it jumped up about half of it
and I'm pretty sure my fluid flow rate
was cut in half or at least half of
those fins were not being fed fluid
properly which will over time affect GPU
temperatures on top of that I also
notice that my CPU was running a bit
than I expected it's not going to very
much from an AI oh but you should see at
least steady temperatures but over time
those temperatures now is stress testing
the CPU through out of 64 I just kept
going up and that's been up and up and
I'm like oh this isn't supposed to
happen I have to three hundred sixty
millimeter radiators in here and that
pump is full blast so what the heck's
going on and what do you know tear down
the CPU block same scenario either
partially or completely clogged fins
these fins that are clogged will not
receive fluid because fluid wants to
travel in the path of least resistance
so if you have something blocking that
particular task we would just won't
waste its time you won't get any fluid
traveling through there it might sit
there and rest but it's not going to try
to force that clog out because it's just
it's way harder for that fluid to do
that then just move around and travel in
a different path so that's bad news as
well for the CPU and god knows what was
going on in those radiators for all I
know they're still partially clogged I
flush them about seven or eight times
with some distilled water soap tried to
get that gunk out but you know you can
only go so far with the rad because you
can't fully deconstruct it needless to
say after about 10 hours of dissecting
the rig cleaning all the components I
flushed the rads I flushed all the GPU
blocks tore them completely a port to
make sure that I had gotten all the gunk
out not and then also cleaning all of
the PE Thu tubing I just I reasonable
doesn't assemble that I reassemble at
all and then I switch - it was a
distilled water base and then I use some
Mayhem's dyes to give it the light blue
color that you're seeing now for more on
those specific names dyes you can watch
this video right here so when it was all
said done
I let the pump run by itself for about
three or so hours I had already tested
this thing beforehand for full 24 so I
knew that if I as long as I'd made the
compression fittings as tight as I did
beforehand we weren't going to have any
leaks to the exact same pipes
everything's literally the same but
everything checked out it's running
behind me and I actually like the
finished product more than I did the
initial blue sky PC with the opaque
fluid now I do want to say one more
important thing before I end this video
Jack from Thermaltake was super cool
super quick about sending an email
wanted to get to the bottom of the
situation when he saw the first social
media post about me saying stay away
from the school and I don't know what
heck's going on that this isn't normal
he asked if I had added anything to the
fluid I said no it's just straight up
c1000 opaque coolant he asked if the
radiators were properly flushed and they
were
or he also said that he had seen this
fluid used in other pcs and that they
weren't having issues and that's why
they were still selling it so I hopped
online checked a few reviews and found
that actually a few people were having
very very similar issues to what I was
having with project blue sky and that's
what concerns me
we cannot pinpoint a specific cause
until then I'm saying stay away from it
because you never know you can buy here
that's completely different from mine
for your custom loop and then
experiencing the same thing and I do not
want any of you to experience what I had
to experience last night if you liked
this video be sure to give it a thumbs
up thumbs down for the opposite click
the subscribe button if you haven't
already and I'll catch you in the next
video
this is Salazar studio thanks for well
