focus recently has been on the 1080 and
not the 1070 I mean even Nvidia CEO
Jenson Wang said about three or so
sentences about the 1070 at the keynote
speech go ahead have a listen but I have
more gtx 1070 6.5 teraflops eight
gigabytes of g5 memory faster than a
Titan X faster than a Titan X 300 and
$79 MSRP and for the Nvidia designed
founders Edition for 49 available all
over the world June 10
I'm not even joking that's all he said
about the 1070 I watched the speech all
the way through and that was it that
little cliff you just saw so that's
probably why we don't see much in terms
of specifications in regards to the 1070
on the web now there's plenty on the
1080 and he in fact he talked personally
about the 1080 for quite a while but the
1070 was was pretty much kept on the DL
and that's a little interesting to me I
wonder if that means the 1070 is
actually the bet buy and they just don't
want people to know that because it
might steal away from some of the 1080
sales earlier on nonetheless I want to
investigate speculate make a few
suggestions maybe throw out a few
opinions of my own let you guys gauge
for yourselves what you think about the
1070 and if invidious personal claims
hold true first up I want to talk about
floating-point performance because we
actually do have physical numbers from
Nvidia in this regard for the 1070 so we
have the Titan X at seven teraflops the
980ti at 6.5 and also coincidentally the
1070 at 6.5 now this falls in line with
the videos claimed the 1070 is on par if
not a little better than the Titan X
when it comes to certain workloads
faster than a Titan X faster than a
Titan X but I have my personal doubts
about this claim and here's why now
disclaimer upfront the 10 70s CUDA core
count is not released yet but going off
of what I've seen is the trend over the
past five or six years it seems like the
10 7
should expect somewhere around 2000 CUDA
cores when you take into consideration
the fact the 1080 has 25 60 even when
you consider the fact that the 1070 is
based on 16 nanometer Pascal transistor
design compared to the Maxwell design of
the Titan X 28 nanometers I still don't
see it I don't see the potential that
the 1070 has to beat the Titan X in any
workload whatsoever I may be completely
wrong about that and will certainly find
out come June 10th but for now I'm going
to remain very skeptical about this
claim another way you can tell is
through the TDP s of both cards graphics
card quote unquote power ultimately has
nothing to do with the frame it's that
you'll see in games I mean look at the
r9 390 how much power that card demands
versus the GTX 970 given the fact that
both cards are fairly similar in most
titles when you take into account the
1080s TDP and then compare that to the
type Nexus and construct a few ratios to
relate the coup de coeur count to the
total power draw and thus overall
performance the 1070 just doesn't stand
a chance at least from these
calculations these might be entirely
inaccurate like I said what we're going
off of right now is a single slide what
you're seeing right now is all we know
essentially about the 1070 so all of
this is speculation but a lot of you
have been asking me about what to expect
from the 1070 given that we don't know
much and that the Nvidia CEO really
didn't say much about it so this is the
best I can do for now and another note
the 1070 will feature eight gigabytes of
gddr5 this plain old g5 memory just like
we've seen in the past with other
maxwell cards no HBM no gddr5 X just
gddr5 that is such a pain to say gddr5
nothing special there and while it
hasn't officially been revealed it does
appear that the 1070 will be based on a
256 or 384 bit memory bus so expect
memory speeds similar to those of the
Titan X and the 980ti and there's
nothing wrong with that but it's
certainly no gddr5 X memory speed eight
gigabytes appears to be a middle ground
between the 980ti is six gigabytes of
onboard vram and the Titan X is 12 and
no we're not looking at a 7.5 plus 0.5
gigabyte issue like we saw in the 970
crossing my fingers here I want to
conclude the video by conducting a few
performance to price ratios so stick
around
I've taken the teraflop values of the
three graphics card that showed in the
original performance graph and divided
each by the current MSRP s you can pick
up the Titan X for about 1,200 bucks on
Amazon the 980ti for about 6
and the 1070 on June 10th for around 400
bucks the ratios you're seeing in this
graph are the performance values per US
dollar spent so with every dollar you
spend you should expect to see X amount
of performance out of each card
clearly the 980ti is almost twice as
valuable as a 1080 way comes to
performance per dollar and on top of
that if we take invidious claim at six
point five teraflops for their 1070 it
does appear that they're 1070 is an even
better bargain than the 980ti
what I want to say now is wait if you
are currently looking for graphics card
especially from the green team it would
just be absurd to purchase one before
definitely May 27th but even June 10th
in my opinion just because we we need to
get these cards in our computers and we
need to test them before you guys make
decisions based on just what Nvidia is
saying we cannot take what any company
says at face value before we actually
get our hands on them because let's be
real they're trying to make money
they're trying to build a pipe it's it's
it's just business and unfortunately
that's what it's come to these days the
1070 appears to be the better bargain
between the two but I'm not ready to put
my personal stamp of approval on that
card just yet until I have it in the
computer and I've already run the
benchmarks I did tell you all that I'd
be purchasing the 1070 over the 10 ages
because it does seem to be the better
bargain and more of you appear to be
interested in that so stay tuned come
June 10th it will take a bit longer for
the card to get here but once it does I
assure you I will have the benchmarks
and we will have a finalized tally of
what to expect between the two cards
should you decide to purchase one or the
other give the video a thumbs up if you
think it deserves one give it a thumbs
down if you just hate everything about
life click the subscribe button if you
haven't already in stay tuned for more
