loop build and all of them is been with
ptg tubing if you've you've asked for
tutorial of sorts I think by this point
I'm experienced enough to give you some
pointers especially for first-timers
because I did not have the smoothest
first time experience bending ptg tubing
I should also note that acrylic for the
most part will behave similarly it's a
bit easier in Summit this is a bit more
difficult depending on what you're
trying to do and some will swear by
acrylic some will swear by ptg this
right here is PE TG tubing but both are
excellent choices for just bending and
including in a custom loop like this so
I'm going to show you how to do that in
this video going to show you the tools
that you'll need and some of the
shortcuts and tricks that I do to make
the bends look smooth like these in here
you
so the first thing you're going to need
obviously is either PTV or acrylic
tubing I don't recommend starting with
glass or cop or something that's very
difficult to to maneuver around and work
with and Bend this stuff is pretty
forgiving ptg is famous for reason it's
popular among custom builders acrylic is
also a good alternative is just a bit
more fragile a bit easier to bend mind
you that I personally prefer PT juice
because it's more forgiving and you'll
see that when we start heating this
thing up and bending it the second thing
you're going to need is some sort of
silicon insert this has to be the same
OD as the ID of your tubing obviously
you want to fill up as much of that
space inside as possible so that when
you bend it the tube isn't collapse on
itself when it's hot you're also going
to need some hand soap this is my sister
zone where it's not mine
just something to lube up the outside of
the insert so that it slides easily into
the tubing and then you'll want some
cutters I recommend use right here these
are just copper cutters believe it or
not but these work excellent of ptg if
you know how to use them correctly which
I'll show you in this video also I
recommend at least 4 feet or something
like this to kind of get you going so
this will basically allow for a smooth
cut all the way around the tubing you'll
see how you just slide it in you clamp
it down and you just rotate it a few
times keep tightening it until the two
by two cuts or you have a deep enough
insert of where you can just cut the
rest of it with this right here there's
beautiful ways to do that I recommend
using both in the beginning then you can
just stick with this or the other tool
vice versa I don't know why these are
here yeah also an important piece to
this puzzle the heat gun this is just a
Waggoner heat gun you can pick up at
Home Depot or Lowe's a bunch of
first-timers and people even who have
been doing this quite a while custom do
builders use a heat gun like this I
recommend keeping it on middle heat on
low heat whatever you want to call it
don't turn up full blast because you'll
have to hold the things super far away
unless you it bubble showing up on the
tubing itself again ptg a bit more
forgiving it's very easy to to form
bubbles on acrylic but if you've been
doing this a while you know you know
roughly how far you should hold your
source away from the tube you should be
okay with either choice also the OD and
ID of the tubing is important that will
determine how far away you want to hold
the tubing from the source of the heat
also how long you need a hole
over the source before you can actually
start bending the tubes the thinner
tubes the ones with the smaller
diameters are easier to bend it won't
require as much heat for a longer period
of time to get those a bend the thicker
tube 60 millimeters which I've worked
with for the most part this is 12
millimeter here but a 16 millimeter OD
is a bit trickier so I recommend
starting with this with a smaller
diameter for your first time let's go
ahead and Bend our first tube or just
into a simple 90 that's a good start for
anybody looking to get into custom
cooling we've already kind of like
soaked up the outside of the silicon
insert so it should just slide right in
and if you want to help it as it's being
inserted further and further into the
tube you can add more soap to it just to
make that you know a smoother process
but you want to get the silicon insert
much further past the turn point in the
acrylic so or the ptg so if I want a 90
about right here then I want the silicon
insert at least a few inches on either
side of that point where I want to turn
it just in case because if you don't
have it insert for over enough and you
start bending and the two partially
melts over here where there is no insert
then that tube might collapse on itself
and that's not what you want that's not
a smooth Bend all right so we've got the
silicon inserted and I've got the heat
gun ready to go so start off with low
heat hold it about three to four inches
away from the source it depends on the
power of the heat gun the thickness of
the tubing for this particular OD twelve
millimeter and the power of this heat
gun about three inches of ways is my
comfort zone again if you're starting
your first time hold a bit further away
but I'm going to show you this is the
entire process how long it takes for
this to start melting so you can expect
you know around the same time if you
using similar tools and it's similar to
Bing you also want to rotate the tubing
so that all surfaces are at least
somewhat heated after about twenty to
thirty seconds I would say you'll start
to see the tube Bend in a particular
direction that's when you know you can
start sending it very slowly and see
it's already starting to bend we don't
want to force it though if we force it
they end up with really ugly turns and
that's what I've noticed a lot of people
will do when they get impatient they
start to see it been like this
and they're like oh good I can bend it a
full 90 now but then it looks terrible
because you'll get a kink here on the
inside because it's not completely
melted and the outside will stretch out
at the point where they'd almost snap
it's getting a little more flexible now
you want to heat the underside the
longer turn of the bend more than the
inside of that turn because the outside
needs to stretch a bit further you want
to focus your heat primarily on the
outside of that turn see we're already
starting to get pretty close to a 90
degree no bubbles no kinks nothing like
that
just give it heat where it feels like it
needs you if you feel resistance you
give heat to that part of the tube kind
of the point of this whole thing you can
kind of work it and we pretty much that
our 90 already at this point and go
ahead and remove it from the heat
I recommend holding it here making sure
that you've turned it properly closing
up to none you can use a tool to make
sure that it's a perfect night I just
eyeball it if it's too much or too
little of a turn then I'll just reheat
it and fix it okay so that looks pretty
good for our first 90 degree Bend
something else to note if you have soap
or water whatever inside the tubing
while you're heating it up don't worry
about that warping your tubing much at
all that's soap just going to want to
move out of the ways it gets really hot
it's just going to be forced elsewhere
in the bend so it won't for the most
part
disturb any of your bends make anything
look weird this is a pretty smooth Bend
here I am satisfied with that now once
it's solidified enough and cooled down
you can go ahead and slide the insert
back out and there you go it's easier to
see the imperfections in the tubing when
you have the silicon out because the
light will Bend around certain increases
and areas on the pipe where it's not
smooth you'll see that a lot easier so
at this point I can see there are a few
tiny little imperfections here this
parts a little flat
there is a little Ridge here at the end
of this turn there's also a ridge at the
end of this turn very difficult to see
but you still still notice it if you're
a perfectionist like I am you'll want to
fix that so I'm gonna show you how to
fix that most people would say it's okay
I mean it looks good from a distance if
you get really close you can tell
they're tiny little
imperfections there so we're going to
put soap back on silicone insert and
we're going to slide it back in it's
it's as long as you make sure that it's
soaked up you know I got water on it
whatever it's going to be fairly easy to
push this back in through the turn so
don't worry about you know after I turn
it I can't put the silicone back in and
we bend it it shouldn't be a problem now
to get rid of the tiny creases that show
up at the ends of your turns all you
have to do is partially heat up the ends
you don't have to twist anything you
don't have to turn it might try to bend
when you heat it back up I mean that's
what it's going to do when it melts but
if you give it just enough heat you'll
allow that PEP heat it partially melts
at least on the outside and that'll
smooth out those edges give you a much
smoother turn overall especially if it's
just a tiny thing that you want to fix
usually just heating it up partially
will do the trick and will smooth out
those ends give you a nice clean finish
so this looks like a solid been here I
would be comfortable putting this in a
build like this no problem at all now
what I want to show you is what happens
if you heat it up too quickly or you
hold it too close to the source also
what happens if you try to bend it
before the tubing is hot enough so that
if this happens to you especially in
your first couple tries you'll know
exactly what to correct the second time
around I've run into these problems
pretty much from the get-go when I first
started also certain tubing will be a
bit more stubborn or a bit easier to
bend I found that Thermaltake and alpha
cool tubing are completely different in
the way that they bend alpha cool tubing
is pretty stubborn it requires a bunch
of heat and if you hold it too close
it'll just start bubbling out it's
pretty tough to work with thermal takes
tubing is very easy to work with I found
and so is primo chill tubing at least in
terms of like ttg I'm not sure about
acrylic ptg stuff is good to work with I
recommend most beginners start with ptg
anyway so I'm going to simulate what
happens if I hold this too close to the
source we're going to try to form some
bubbles on here so that you see what
that looks like
summits are on high heat don't recommend
doing that so I'm going to do high heat
and I'm gonna hold it pretty close
pretty close to the source
you see it's already starting to them
there's a lot of heat coming out of it
but you're thinking yourself oh yeah
it's starting to bend that's great look
at that we've already got a big bubble
here that's not good that's a bunch of
heat that's a bunch of just heated air
trapped in the tube that's expanding
right now because it's so hot so that is
not good this whole run is toast now you
have to redo the entire Bend and that's
what happened with PE teach you get
larger bubbles when it gets too hot if
you have acrylic more than likely what
will happen with that is you'll get tiny
little bubbles that show up everywhere
and that's just the nature of the way
that it's chemically made not it just
reacts differently to high heat so this
is taupe see there there's no way I can
get this back at all it's completely
wasted go ahead and just trash it
something else to note the silicon can
get extremely hot but it likely won't
melt you'd have to hold it directly over
the flame to see that things start
melting so don't worry about how hot it
is getting inside the tubing it should
be okay if it's a it's manufactured
properly so the other thing I want to
simulate is what happens if you bend
this tube without it being hot enough so
you've seen how hot it needs to be or
how close it needs to be the high flame
too to start bubbling up now we're going
to try bending the tube if it's not hot
enough you'll see the kinks and the
imperfections in the turn so when you
start seeing that you want to bend
you're not supposed to just do that it
would happen there so you have a big
kink on the inside and the outside is
pretty darn stretched so that will
impede your flow it also looks terrible
this is not hot enough and it's the
heats not spread out enough on the
tubing for a nice dent so for a good
turn you want to have all sides like I
said at least partially heated you want
the outside the turn the most heated
because it stretches the most the inside
you don't have to worry too much about
heating unless you feel it really being
resistant to the turn but the signs are
almost just as important as heating the
outside of the turn if you don't heat
the sides you will get that kind of like
warping like stretching of the tubing on
the sides of the term now what you just
saw is actually only half the battle we
have to cut tubing remember so we have a
good 90 here this is the first one that
we made but we want to cut it too to
spec we want to cut it to length so that
it fits and our other components and our
other fittings well without you know
extending too far out and warping the
rest of our turns so I recommend using
at least something like this this is
thermaltake cutter here a lot of the
custom cooling companies will sell
something like this pretty much it also
sells one I'll have all these tools by
the way linked in the description if you
want to do this yourself so a tool like
this is very simple to use there's some
rollers up top and you want to just rest
the tubing inside the roller like that
and then you want to turn this this is
the the cutter part or things like a
pizza cutter right so you want to just
barely rest it against the ptg like so
enough to where it's held in place now
you want to rotate the tubing and what
will happen is as you rotate it that
cutter will create a circle like cut all
the way around the PE TG that's good can
you do this for krill ik as well because
it doesn't really matter which type
you're using and then as after you've
gotten a solid cut in there and you want
to tighten it a bit more so that cuts
slightly deeper into that previous run
now you could theoretically do this all
the way until the pipe snaps the thing
is though if you do that with the tool
like this then you're gonna have the
deeper the insides and likely the
outsides because this cutter is going to
warp the inner diameter of the tubing
which could affect fluid flow could
affect the just the readiness of the
tubing to fit inside of fitting or
something else in your loop so you can
keep going again you keep going till it
cuts like I said though I don't
recommend doing that if you want a clean
cut you want to have to use a tool like
this which is a deeper still have it on
hand
you can use it to cut the inside down
and the outside of tubing down go ahead
and remove this now use your pipe cutter
you want to align the cutter itself up
as close as you can to the groove it
should be deep enough the original cut
with this should be deep enough in the
tubing to where you can just rest this
cutter gently inside that groove the
lower you are the easier it will be to
cut slowly slide through there we go
now we'll get a close-up on this tube
here if you've got a good clean cut you
shouldn't have to do anything else to it
now if you've gotten comfortable enough
using both of these tools you can just
ditch this all together if you want it
just takes longer to use this and then
this or just use this by itself you can
just use the tube cutter you can kind of
create a ring with the pipe and the
cutter itself kind of like what you did
with this you're just using
the typesetter itself to do that you've
got a solid enough string again start
low on the cutter there you go and if
you cut it well you should have clean
cuts on either side one thing you don't
want to do though is just put it
superfast in our tubing it's okay
sometimes to do that I wouldn't trust it
though because what you might end up
doing is like squeezing the tubing you
might end up warping it and just kind of
narrowing it on one side and making it
wider on another that won't fit into any
fitting that I know of it's compatible
with twelve millimeter tubing so just be
careful cut it slower it's better to cut
it slower because you'll be more precise
and you know exactly what you're doing
to the tube so if you start bending it
in a way that you don't want to bend it
while it's being cut you know to just
back off and maybe come at it from a
different angle
so that's my tutorial for how to bend
and cut ptg tubing acrylic will behave
similarly I keep saying that I'm not
using it though in this tutorial because
if you're watching this video if you
have to watch it to figure out how to
bend and cut tubing I recommend starting
with PE TJ I think it's a good starting
point it's very forgiving even if you
bend it the wrong way you can usually
reheat that Bend and then kind of adjust
it as you see fit
so it's forgiving and it's not going to
frustrate you as much as acrylic model I
think in the first couple tries
especially if you're trying to figure
out how far away from the heat source to
hold the tubing with that if you have
