that anti-aliasing or MSA a for short is
a very taxing additive to almost any
game that you can possibly play on your
personal computer now I may get grilled
in the comments for what I'm about to
say next only because it's a very very
general generalization but for those of
you who don't know what anti-aliasing is
imagine a sphere made out of squares
those squares are the pixels in your
screens and they're gonna look a little
jagged they're not gonna look very
smooth what anti-aliasing attempts to do
is smooth out those services by dimming
some pixels around the edges of those
spheres and other curve services in your
games that's as much as I'm going to say
about anti-aliasing there are plenty of
videos on YouTube describing into
aliasing in much more detail that's
really out of the scope of this video
disclaimer right up front you do not
need anti-aliasing to run any game of
your choosing anti-aliasing is just an
added feature it's something that would
be nice to have if you could afford it
and what I mean by afford it is well
you're going to need a pretty pricey
graphics card to be able to run
anti-aliasing in any game whatsoever I
mean an r7 370 is gonna it's pretty much
gonna cut your FPS in half and r9 380 or
gtx 960 it can do it but if you're
playing anything other than 1080p don't
expect to get anywhere above times 2
anti-aliasing so the solution I have for
you if you're willing to spend an extra
hundred or so US dollars is the GTX 970
now the r9 390 would also be a great
candidate in this case however in my
particular case I was worried about
power I only have 600 what bronze in
here and I'm overclocking my 4690k to
4.4 gigahertz so the power curve issue
was there I wanted to stay within the
efficiency the peak efficiency curve of
my power supply and on top of that it
does run a bit hotter than the GTX 970
on average but for the sake of
preventing any potentially hazardous
arguments from taking place in the
comments below you definitely could
substitute the GTX 970 for and r9 390
and experience about a 5 to 10 FPS boost
in games so the one game that we chose
in this benchmark was GTA 5 not only
because we could adjust the
anti-aliasing multiplier but also
because we could see how anti-aliasing
affected different presets within the
game
we could change a lot of individual
settings to see how all of those were
affected by the increase in
anti-aliasing with respect to the frame
per second rate so our control test was
just setting everything too high without
any anti-aliasing on whatsoever this
includes fxaa ambient occlusion and
shadows being set to soft additionally
no advanced graphic settings were
touched at all those were all turned off
or set to zero and the average frame
rate that we received from this first
test was about 127 now if you've seen
some of my previous videos about the gtx
960 you're probably thinking well hey
the gtx 960 was getting about 115 120
FPS that's literally just barely under
what our 970 is getting and this 970
costs $100 more well yes and those were
sent at the exact same preset so really
apples to apples you're only getting
about a 10 FPS boost with an extra $100
cost but where things start to change is
when you start adding things on in the
game so when you start increasing
resolutions when you start increasing
the anti-aliasing level the multiplier
there or when you start tinkering with
the advanced graphics settings the gtx
960 experiences a severe dip in fps
whereas the 970 experiences a more
shallow decline so that's what you're
about to see the next set of tests
included everything being the same as it
was in the first set except turning up
our anti-aliasing multiplier 2 times 2
and the FPS that we received in this set
of tests was 104 now I should note that
when we did the exact same thing with
our 960 having everything on high and
then just adjusting our anti-aliasing
multiplier 2 times to our FPS was cut
from about 115 to 74 so literally almost
a 50% dip in FPS only because of 2 times
anti-aliasing that's that's a big cut
for a 960 that's a big cut for any
graphics card but in the case of our 970
a cut from 127 to 104 is less than 20%
so it definitely stood its ground much
better than the 960 did and this is
we're gonna see your money start to make
sense how much more you pay for this 9
70% 960 is when you start turning up
these settings
next set of tests was keeping everything
exactly the same again but moving from x
to anti-aliasing to x 4 and this time
our FPS rate decreased of course it
decreased but it decreased to 94
doubling the anti-aliasing multiplier
again from x 2 to x 4 only decreased our
average FPS rate by 10 so literally just
under 10% cut from x 2 to x 4 in the
same regard our gtx 960 received an FPS
cut from the mid 70s to about 44 FPS so
again near 50% cut in frame rate from a
simple doubling of the anti-aliasing
multiplier things aren't looking too
good for our 960 but our 970 is
definitely holding up so let's push it
to the limit
GTA 5 only allows us to go 2 times 8
anti-aliasing so that's what we did with
the next set of tests and with x 8a
anti-aliasing and everything else being
set to high as it was originally our FPS
rate average was 81 so again only about
a 10% cut from doubling the
anti-aliasing multiplier it's pretty
incredible most cards by this point
would not even run in fact our GTX 960
only produced 22 fps in this run so this
one was literally cut in half from 44 to
22 keep in mind this is a 1080p and
everything else set to high so our GTX
960 was pretty much done for there was
no point in going any further with these
tests with that card in particular
because 22 FPS is just not playable
unless you're into super super choppy
gameplay which would be that would be
crazy
but as for our GTX 970 things were
definitely playable still 81 FPS is
superb for having x 8 anti-aliasing on
but how much further can we push our
additional settings on top of that x 8
anti-aliasing multiplier and still stay
within the bounds of about 60 FPS which
I would deem playable let's see how far
this rabbit hole goes that was a matrix
reference the matrix you guys seen the
matrix tell me you've seen the matrix
you see the matrix rep we literally took
every setting that we could on the
standard graphics tab of GTA 5 and max
everything out everything was turned on
to either very high for the highest
preset or ultra for that highest preset
we also had FX
Aion we had ambient occlusion on we had
everything turned up all the way
including motion blur maxed out
everything you can think of in the
standard graphics tab was turned up all
the way and we still achieved 62 fps in
GTA 5 gameplay so the very last test we
could run was maxing out all the
advanced tabs as well so turning up
distance scaling to max turning on long
shadows high resolution shadows I think
was in there a few other things so with
the advanced graphics turned on and or
all the way up and compensating for a
few things like ambient occlusion FXAA
and MSA reflections things like that
that we had to counteract that
additional V around with to make sure
that we stayed below the 3.5 gig you
know boundary you don't wanna pass that
boundary you don't want to do it in GTX
970 we received a frame rate of 54 54
fps with as much as we could possibly
max out on our card including x 8
anti-aliasing 54 is pretty darn playable
for a $300 card expect to max out pretty
much any game at 1080p and I would say
60 to 70 percent of most games in ultra
wide or maybe even 1440p gaming also I
have white ddr3 in my rig now no longer
that red ddr3 that I had before it is a
bit slower in 1866 megahertz but I don't
really care I'm more of an aesthetics
person as long as the thing functions
mostly the same I'm okay with that
just looks pretty darn cool keep in mind
