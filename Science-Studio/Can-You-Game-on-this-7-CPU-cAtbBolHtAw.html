title the creation this entire video was
an absolute nightmare
so what specific Xeon processor did I
use well I use the one you can find
currently on Amazon for about seven
dollars and it's the Intel Xeon 5140
with only two physical cores and no
hyper-threading four megabytes of l2
cache and a clock speed of 2.3 gigahertz
the CPU was quite underwhelming the CPU
takes depended of 65 nanometer
lithography from the Woodcrest lineup
and uses the LGA 771 socket the actual
construction of the PC wasn't all that
complicated but the motherboard was huge
and could actually take advantage of two
CPUs but I didn't feel like waiting for
another one to arrive apart from the
chip itself
I used a custom LGA 771 CPU cooler which
featured a nice large copper slug at the
base oh and check this out a 5 pin fan
connector the power supply or supplies I
should say that we'll be using for one
are the EVGA 500 watt bronze power
supply which should power pretty much
everything except for a single
additional 4 pin power connector
required by the motherboard to power the
peripherals and things of that sort
I tried powering the PC on without that
4 pin connector plugged in and nothing
happened the computer refused to boot so
I ended up having to scavenge for a
cheap 230 watt power supply that I could
jumpstart using a jumper cable included
with the EVGA power supply and then wire
that 4 pin connector up into the
motherboard so I was actually utilizing
two power supplies if you follow me on
Twitter you'll know that I hinted at
Austin Evans attempt at running two
power supplies in tandem and he seemed
to be appreciative of that the graphics
card I threw in there is actually the
one that's in this rate currently it's
the GTX 960 gigabyte 1/4 g1 gaming
Edition graphics card and needless to
say it was pulling the weight of the
entire PC it took quite a while to get
this PC running but when it finally did
and I was able to install Windows 10
from a jump drive well I was relieved
because it took quite a while we're
talking about 2 or 3 hours to install
Windows 10 for a computer like this that
usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes you
might be wondering why I haven't
mentioned RAM yet and that's because I
have something to show you when I opened
up hardware monitor for the first time I
realized that both dims were super super
hot
talking 100 c-plus regardless the dims
were functional and when I came to the
rational conclusion in my head that if
the computer dies because of the RAM I
really don't care I decided to start
running some benchmarks first up on our
list with Cinebench and it took so so
long our score ultimately ended up being
99 Seabee and I'm pretty sure most of
your phones could perform better the rig
behind me is also a Zeon bill but this
one score is 798 CV compared to the 99
of this 51:40 up next was Geekbench
and well nothing exciting there again
I'm pretty sure some of your phones
could beat that but let's talk about
games because that's the meat of this
video I tried to open rise of the Tomb
Raider and nothing happened I also tried
to open hitman and I was informed that
my specifications did not meet the
minimum requirements next up was GTA 5
and wow I actually got into this game
after a few failed attempts but under
one condition
running the game in safe mode which
meant an 800 by 600 resolution and
pretty much everything turned down as
low as possible nonetheless I would call
this unplayable but alas there was still
hope in dirt rally dirt rally is a very
graphics intensive game so I didn't
expect the CPU to be as much of a
bottleneck as it was in the other well 1
but preventing the other 2 from even
opening up and my assumption was correct
somewhat that the game did open and it
was a bit laggy at first but once the
CPU kind of caught on to what was going
on the game did allow me to navigate to
the benchmark mode and then proceeded to
let the benchmark run the game was very
choppy at times and other times the
window would auto minimize for some
reason but we did receive viable
benchmark results check these out so
while most certainly our minimums
prevented this game from actually being
playable in the real world
our average framerate really wasn't all
that bad around 20 to 30 when you take
into consideration the fact that we're
using a processor that's over 10 years
old it's not too bad ok what I meant to
say was that the CPU exceeded my
expectations in dirt rally but in the
other three games it pretty much as
expected to conclude this video I would
like to point out that gaming on a seven
dollar processor is not recommended
while there are some exceptions to this
rule I mean dirt rally was still
somewhat playable and you could play
games like pinball and minesweeper on
the PC no problem in most cases you
won't even be able to open the game you
wish to play
sorry fans of GTA 5 tomb raider and
hitman no $7 cpu for you give the video
a thumbs up
and unique give it a thumbs down if you
hate everything about life click
