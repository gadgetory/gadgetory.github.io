sending us to Computex 2017 welcome back
everyone at Computex point 17 we're here
at the air live booth and their smart
home solution we've got a lot of cool
stuff to talk about it's a different
take on tech I know that most of you are
used to the PC side of things but I
think this stuff is actually very
interesting and it gives way to a lot of
interesting things for home solutions
home security in general and here's your
smart life IOT kit starting first with
the Gateway up top just think of it as
like your central hub to all of these
other components you're going to
communicate with this device which
connects online and in turn connect with
your mobile devices to give you full
control over what is happening within
your home or wherever you happen have
you set up for example generic home
security stuff here you open this up it
communicates with the hub and it'll
notify you on something like your iPad
that the door has been open so from a
security standpoint that is fairly
routine another important note the smart
life gateway can connect up to two
hundred and thirty two of these devices
whether or not you have a very large
office base or just a small home it
shouldn't have a problem with the number
of devices you can connect to it and
thus be able to read and interact with
on your mobile device that's something
like this you might be wondering okay
this just looks simple outlet flows what
on earth does it do so if you plug this
into a wall outlet and then in turn
let's say plug it into a lamp and from
your mobile device you can control
whether or not this is on and delivering
power to that device plugged in you can
also set up if-then statements that
we'll show you later on let's say you're
let's say your parents are out for the
night and you want them to have light
when they get back if motion sensor
detects them and within close range of
your house and you can set an if-then
statement to say if that detects them
this will send power to say a power
strip with a bunch of lights plugged in
maybe wire it into your home directly so
that it'll light up those lights for
them without them having to actually
turn them on manually so ease of use is
definitely involved here now to be clear
this is not just a window door sensor
obviously open the door you get the
notification it's also got a built in
temperature sensor as well as of those
on light sensors this one right here is
just a PIR sensor so infrared radiation
detects motion from a certain distance
away calibrated to around the human side
so it won't go off your dog or cat is
walking back and forth but if a human
that you don't expect to be there is
there then it will notify it within the
app than your mobile device that this
sensor is going off the camera of top is
actually very cool it's got all these
sensors built in practically temperature
we've got the PIR you also have a camera
itself so you can view a kind of a live
feed so nice it's all coordinated to the
cameras a big one though because this
has everything in it so you can just buy
this by itself so this is the air live
app there's a lot of stuff you can do
here you can view live feeds you can set
scenes you can sit like certain time
stamps for things to happen at certain
times throughout the day you also have
the macro sphere back to what we're
talking about with programming a certain
responses to stimuli to each setup so we
have the PIR sensor which was that round
sphere that detect infrared radiation
basically motion if that is triggered by
any person then you can set a venn
statement the meter listed this we have
a meter here we can set the meter to
turn on if we have a light plugged into
it and the light will turn on if the PIR
sensor is true another cool thing about
this actually it will auto report power
consumption throughout the day and give
you a kind of report of how much power
you've drained from myth itself they
kind of gauge your power usage and
actually control your power ball to an
extent now if you wanted to go up price
depending on what you want to your kit
you can either get a kit with the camera
from around here or a kit with the smart
plug cost you anywhere from around 200
to 250 s US dollars depending on MSRP it
subject to change a little bit but
expect to pay around that price for kit
like this which mind you isn't that bad
and if you want just the camera which
has remember everything built into it
around 140 US dollars so depending on
how much you want to spend how much
coverage you want in your home or place
of business expecting to spend anywhere
from 100 to 300 bucks which isn't all
that bad for a full-on security system
that you can integrate and communicate
with through your mobile device now our
life focuses on other solutions as well
an interesting one we didn't well I
didn't personally know much about till
we came here the fact that 4G LTE
connection that you might have from your
phone from your service provider here
anyway is excellent it's actually
phenomenal and I'm kind of spoiled by at
this point I'm going to hate going back
home because my data connection over
there is not nearly as good so what
airline's done is taken advantage of
benefit they've given you a solution
where you can actually plug in your
phone sim
it's just used things take any phone SIM
card you have t-mobile SIM card
something along those lines pop that
thing into here and then you got
yourself wireless connectivity wireless
Internet connectivity from your cell
phone service which is actually a not a
not a new idea but it works excellent in
certain markets here it would work great
in Taiwan so think of this like a mobile
hotspot instead of your phone doing that
for you taking your cell phone's
connection from a tower and projecting
that it's like a Wi-Fi signal this takes
the load off this does it all for you
with a simple SIM card insert here in
Taiwan it's actually a very applicable
because you could be able to limited
data then this is something that would
be very useful even in home applications
you could put it in your car even as a
GPS antenna by the way so if your car
whatever you happen to throw this into
you get stolen or taken unexpectedly
then you can actually track it just with
this dedicated antenna here and if you
want it for a home solution or an office
solution and you can actually wire just
straight up rj45 port from this system
from your cell power directly into your
PC or other device so this law
application it might not make as much
sense now in the US markets because we
don't have unlimited data yet there's
throttling issues sometimes you get you
know up to 2030 gigabytes in a month and
a lot of people will go actually over
that or get pretty darn close to it so
if useless for sure you'll be using a
lot of data especially if you're using
it as a home solution because so many
devices will be connected to it but this
is kind of like the motivator so we're
trying to push people into this into
this like wireless connectivity mindset
in a place like Taiwan it's already here
I have a limited data on a sim card that
I purchased for like 10 u.s. dollars
equivalent like it's here we just have
to convince the markets elsewhere that
this is the future so here's your
typical home Wi-Fi router got your
standard 12 volt in 4 LAN ports USB
interface so a lot of you probably own
one of these at some point are still
currently do these are still very common
in households and then here's a typical
access point in a nutshell think of an
access point as an extension of your
routers Wi-Fi signal if you set up let's
say three or four of these in your home
they all share the same SSID then you'll
have one large Wi-Fi projection thanks
to all of easi I've set up on top of
what could be spotty with your Wi-Fi
router by itself another interesting
point of
this Kyoya the net which means that
you're actually delivering power to the
access point via the internet cable
basic allows you to cut your 12-volt
line you don't have to have as many
wires to deal with when you set these
things up literally pop in the internet
cable just screw it into your ceiling
wherever you have these mounted and
there ya go
not again for typical Wi-Fi routers or
something like this maybe a person would
have one of these with Keowee support
this is all you would need it's actually
very portable solution or you could be a
straight boss and have something like
this I feel like we'll have something
like this in this house now to be frank
we just barely scratched the surface of
the Internet of Things air live is
called air live because they're all
about wireless connectivity making
things simple to use over just wireless
uplink
wireless connectivity having a home
security system is completely wireless
even access from a mobile device is
extremely convenient it's I think the
way of the future and are so many other
industrial applications that we haven't
even talked about yet that probably
don't apply to most of you but if you
are interested you can check those
details out in the video description
with that we're going to call it a day
here this is science to do thanks for
traveling with
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
