gonna wait a second now to see if I'm
getting playback on screen I apologize
if the mic sounds just a little weird
guys let me know I can fine-tune it for
some reason I can't pass through audio
on my camera so I'm literally left with
just running the mic your life through
my wait a second I'll box here I'm
getting and it's a little playback on
screen my desktop I apologize that the
mic sounds just a little alright sorry
about that I fixed that I think I fixed
it check in the chat I'm gonna pull up
my chat on my phone and watch that as
I'm doing this this is a little weird
excuse me it's a little weird and I
usually and they usually don't try to
manage all this as a one-man show but
okay alright I think we're good I'm
pretty pretty sure we're good let's see
okay so I can see my hand on screen the
camera stops right about there on that
side and about there on that side okay
all right you guys think the audio
sounds okay yeah yeah and that's not
gonna be superb kind of did this last
minute so now I want to talk about why
we're doing this in today's live stream
I was actually going to do some
dedicated video but I said screw it
we'll just do a live and just wing it
and see how it goes so probably a
catastrophe but least you get to watch
it live it'll be somewhat entertaining
for you so this right here I'm pretty
sure you're gonna be able to see that in
focus pretty high up because I turned I
dropped that ball high really really
shrunk the aperture so it should look
pretty good but this is a gtx 1070 fe
board nothing special about this other
than the fact that it used to be on a on
a reference card on this card here or
what was in this box and I ended up
having to swap the boards I stuck with
the same cooler on this card but I
swapped the boards because the FE board
died and it died actually in the middle
of painting the founders edition shroud
which kind of sucked so I am going to
want to try my best to swap this board
back to its original blower style cooler
which is this guy right here actually
now that I look at it I don't even know
if I have the correct back plate for the
oh no I do it's just on this card okay
yeah so so this is that like off-brand
it's actually it came out of an old Dell
but it's a you see some I think MSI
calls us like the MSI Aero series but
this blower style card here our blower
just actually it's just a it's a cooler
it is kind of recycled from manufacturer
to manufacturer but this is not going to
be very great for temps it's not going
to be very
quiet either that's why I recommend
stayin away from blower style unless
certain circumstances maybe you're
running like as an ITX pc these are
better for keeping hot air out of your
small case so you would want to use
something like this in that event but it
would still run quite loud
so this PCB again came from the founders
edition card right but the the backplate
whatever you want to call this this
plate here came off of this car so I
took this card I took its it's back
plate off and swapped the founder
Edition back plate with the other PCB
because the back plate on this card
wouldn't fit the founders Edition cooler
so yeah I know it's kind of confusing
but I'll probably better explain it as
we get closer to it I'm gonna power it
out of the way real quick when I open
this up and show you guys what I'm
talking about so how are we doing in the
comments we're doing a write the chat
all right
yeah they om for Dell sometimes yes sir
Chris Chris knows we was talking about
Corsair Chris come on Chris and yeah so
that's where this came from it was Adele
it was actually out of an Aurora r7
which I reviewed excuse me in a
dedicated video now you can see here on
the very bottom is the partial PCB
exposure right here above the little
PCIe slot and that green PCB was on this
cooler right so when this board died
which was in the founders Edition card
the this reference card here when this
board died I went ahead and took the
green PCB out of this card and put it in
this EFI cooler right and that's why
it's green I did my best I actually took
I actually took sharpie and I colored
all the way down the sides here any any
part of the PCB that was exposed that
that I could color safely because it was
green pretty much all the way around it
just looks terrible because there was
you know black painted you know graphics
card cooler and then just like a green
line there so we're gonna take this card
apart we're gonna take this PCB out this
is hole bore
ten seventy board and we're gonna put it
back in the arrow blower cooler reason
I'm doing that is because this was in
Lisa's old build the board still works
but the cooler it's just kinda I mean it
only really works in a yellow themed
bill this was like a baby yellow and I
painted the rest of the shroud black and
Lisa really liked it for her bill but
now she's sporting something else so I I
don't really want to try to you know use
nail polish remover something to pull
this paint off the other thing is I'm
missing the GeForce GTX logo in here so
it looks kind of stupid without that so
I think what I'm gonna do is just I
don't know if someone wants this and
they want to pay shipping I might just
ship it to you if you really want to do
something weird with it you think you
get the paint off and start from scratch
if someone else is selling an EFI cooler
like this a gtx 1070 efi cooler I'd like
to buy that off of you so if you want to
leave a comment in the in the video once
it's archives or you can email me
marketing a science to do then I would
like to buy that off of you if you live
in the continuous kind well how do you
why do you say that in the contiguous 48
states okay so let's get to disassembly
now I apologize this is not the most
professional disassembly livestream I
already know that going into it but I'm
going to try my best
let's see here try to zoom in is that
right no yeah that is right how far are
we in there it's not too bad and are we
still in focus let me know if we're
still in focus after that zoom in folks
because I can't really see it on the far
side of my computer desk it's kind of
away from me this is the build desk here
so I've got this little tool kits got a
bunch of Phillips heads flat heads
really convenient this is a cobalt kit
it's just you know you can get these for
like 10 20 bucks Walmart at other places
and a micro Center sells stuff pretty
similar to this you want I fix a toolkit
you want to go all out you can do it
with iFixit
but I'm going to start by removing the
you don't have to start by removing it
I'm actually gonna I'm gonna save that
for last cuz that's those are the four
screws holding
and really what is the GPU which is
right here in the center so I'm actually
gonna put a smaller head on there and
we're gonna unscrew these tiny ones okay
someone said the sound of PCBs makes me
nervous
spider I agree with you on that one
let's see a psychic says it's InFocus
okay that's cool all right Sean says
love your reviews good luck with the
channel I appreciate that Sean thanks
for stopping by all right so we're gonna
start with these oh my gosh these are
super small screws I really want to
strip these because if I do that means
I'm gonna have to take a drill to it and
I'll probably end up puncturing the PCB
in the process so let's not do that I
also apologize if you hear anything in
the background where's my wife Lucy err
with me as well as my brother currently
my parents are the process of moving so
I'm helping them out while they're
taking care of that let's get this screw
I was missing a couple actually one of
these screws completely broke off I
don't even know where it which one it is
might be them might be the middle one I
think that was broke off yeah
these screws are super small so you know
you know you don't want to lose these
okay another small one you got to push
really hard here again this is really to
strip the sidewalls of these screws are
very tiny make sure you use a very fine
Phillips head screw for this if you've
ever torn down and founders cooler you
probably know the pain I know that the
new r-tx car is the new Founders cards
are even more difficult to take apart
especially the 2060 well they can glue
and stuff they're using in there okay
that one's good so the way this bit does
backplate works it's kind of a two-piece
backplate so see you just kind of piece
by piece here so you want to install
this side of the backplate closest to
the rear i/o plate first because there's
a small little lip here if you can see
that but there's a small lip and you
want this sitting underneath the back
portion of the back plate so this side
goes in first that's why I took this
side off first
and we're just gonna set this to the
side for now again if someone wants this
you know just send me an email or
something
leave a comment I'll read all the
comments after this live stream archives
and let's see these small screws again
these are just the small screws that are
holding in the back blade and we'll get
to those remaining three larger Phillips
screws afterward they're gonna be the
final four that hold in the cooler
they're actually the only well they're
not technically the only things that
secure the cooler to the card but they
are the ones that probably provide the
most tension around the GPU it's
important that you keep that thing
pressed as firmly as possible against
the the GPU die you want to have proper
contact good for heat transfer no air
pockets or anything of the sort I am NOT
gonna remember where I put these screws
we got one more small one get in there
yeah okay so that's all the small screws
how are we doing over there folks
checking out the chat right now you guys
look like you're doing okay I have one
more screw totally forget about this one
way over here if I do anything that
freaks you out someone says I need a
gamer's Nexus mod mat I actually have
one problem is it doesn't fit this table
perfectly this tables a little small
that mod mat is huge and I used it quite
a bit at my old apartment and that was
because I had me I know self-made desks
and I'd actually fit perfect it's like a
24 to 2 foot by 4 foot mod man I believe
and it was good for for that table that
this table is I don't think it's wide
enough
it's not a perfect 2 by 4 rectangle so
that's why I'm not using one I actually
well yeah
I just bought this table too so actually
I'm kind of concerned about that
maybe we'll get a piece of cardboard or
something and put that over here
otherwise whatever there's like a
hundred bucks for this table I'll just
use it till a false part okay we have ah
see this is what sucks about founders
cards most AI bees won't do this but
we've got the four large screws right
surrounding with GPU itself and we've
got these stupid freaking nuts that well
they're not even nut they're technically
screws but they have there they're hex
heads and they literally surround the
entire card so you have to screw these
tiny little Phillips screws into the
tops of these heads so it's kind of like
a screw in a screw and of course only
Nvidia would do that I am going to need
see we got one removed right here this
wasn't even tightened down Wow
I don't think the camera is gonna pick
this up but I just want to show you the
top of it see it's got a it's a
hexagonal shaped head but it has a
thread inside of it and that's where the
small screws that we just removed right
into so kind of stupid if you ask me
actually most of these are just hand
tightened Wow
that's pretty crazy someone said that's
nuts
I'm just gonna yeah I'm gonna
nonchalantly remove these hand tighten
nuts I know I did this I did I'm pretty
sure I had to remove this cooler like
three or four times during the swaps I
kept forgetting to well at one point I
forgot to even wire the blower fan to
the PCB I was like oh my god I gotta
take this whole thing apart again so I
think after like the third or fourth
time I'll just like screw it I'm just
gonna hand tighten these things because
really the most important part of this
you want to make sure that you're
getting contact with those thermal pads
around the vo RM the MOSFETs the RAM and
also around the the GPU and that's you
know these four take care of that so
yeah I definitely kind of Jimmy rigged
it but okay
I guess says you should do back massage
ASMR not homo I I guess I'll take that
as a compliment that's probably the
microphone to be honest you are in a
peaceful place I'm just kidding I'm not
going to do that there are so many these
stupid screws all over the board we
haven't even gotten this thing off yet
you see why I was wanting to make a
dedicated video on this because it is a
process anything that takes me along
about an hour to do I'll film just
because no no I think people enjoy
watching other people work and when it's
tech involved I mean come on who doesn't
like that
alright we have like two more am I gonna
be old up oh yeah I think I'm gonna be
able to Handler Sinise alright Chris
says he's done that I forgot to plug the
fan back when he removed a water block
from a 1080 TI I think we've all been
there at least once Oh am I gonna be
able get this off come on it's just like
the one thing that you don't think about
you know you're you're worried about all
the missing screws and making sure all
those holes are occupied and and you
know thermal pads and making sure
everything's aligning correctly you're
just not thinking about that stupid wire
and if there's more than one wire then
you probably won't even have our jeebies
running if it's a LED card all right I
have one more this piece right here you
guys that looking ok on camera mm I can
kind of see it I'll move it right there
in the center we're gonna keep going
this is an ugly ugly green PCB all right
so all these hex screws are removed how
not only the official name for its a hex
screw but there are screws nonetheless
and now we're just gonna tackle these
remaining three larger ones that
surround the GPU I'll clean up the dye
and we'll swap this board back to the
Aero cooler which is in my opinion
significantly uglier actually louder as
well you know I think these founders
cards get a bad rap they used to be a
lot worse but now they've gotten I would
say except ibly quiet there
not gonna be as quiet as some aiv cards
and cooler sure but yeah for what it is
a founders edition card is really not
that not that bad okay so we've removed
pretty much everything securing the
board to the cooler now we're just gonna
pull it up let's see how this goes oh
and we got I remember we have a cable
connected between the two so we can't
just straight up rip this off
am I forgetting uh yeah if I break this
whole board at least it'll be live oh
why is it not coming off sometimes you
got to pull these you got a prime
because the thermal paste kind of sticks
but we don't have anything on that side
holding it in anymore so why is it not
coming off am I missing something
no screw it's gonna yank out there we go
oh that board is flexing more than I
would like
oh wait am I forgetting one are you
kidding me alright so there's a Phillips
screw like right there in the middle one
of these is holding yeah I think that
one is holding the cooler to the
backplate which is it's whatever you
know they're like I'm just not thinking
about that being one of the things
holding in it makes sense though give me
a second nose is kind of off camera I'm
just gonna take care of this screw and
see it's uh
that one right there we're moving that
now and Shellback got it
she'll back called it out could you have
Shellback and it's actually is this the
other one that's not-- it was just that
one and oh no it was it was this there's
two there's two it's this other one
right here next to it you guys see that
one right there that one is also holding
the cooler yeah yeah there we go here we
go
yeah no that's tougher here in my
experience a lot of the IVs don't even
secure the cooler to the backplate but
it probably does provide some rigidity
so there's that okay so we've got the
PCB exposed I'm going to
attach the fan cable from the PCB
somehow know how I'm gonna do that and
see I'll just flip it over and pull it
apart that way sure we got my tweezers
that have been really helpful right now
why is this not coming off runner yank
it there we go okay
no no parts were harmed during the
making of his livestream and yeah so
there's our cooler you can see some
nasty thermal is he was like it doesn't
look like a thermal paste spread very
well but whatever I mean the temps were
okay and now with that removed we're
gonna clean up we have to die and then
we'll get to fixing this back to the og
blower so I've got toilet paper
courtesy of Walmart cleaning the bad boy
up no isopropyl alcohol here I actually
just ran out so we're gonna do this the
old-fashioned way
I'm breaking so many rules right now and
live at that it's even worse get
immediate public feedback we could clean
up the edge a little bit but it's really
not gonna not gonna hurt to leave a lot
of that there I'll just scrape it in and
go get as much as we can without this
toilet paper fraying I'd like to have is
a little this little toilet paper is
possible on the GPU you know I'm saying
also Jesus look at the state of these
thermal pads like well yeah they're okay
it's alright yeah so see I'll flip it
this way for you we're gonna recycle the
thermal pads on this I actually had a
water block that guy I have another 1070
that's on a block from Thermaltake it's
this one right here and I was prepared
to completely rip this apart and
actually no this is a 1080 yeah this is
a 1080 I just don't have another cooler
for the 1080 so it's kind of just
chillin
really that's what I should do I should
take this out and put it on the on the
arrow card but whatever well we'll save
that for another day but I was gonna
take the thermal pads from knives I
don't have any extra thermal pads laying
around but someone says why doesn't he
just clean it with soap and water I
couldn't I gotta clean up the soap and
water it's just not good practice you
know one more time or pass through it'll
be all right okay
yeah good enough I don't expect this to
be a perfect solution Shane says why
should people complain about you using
toilet paper you're literally wiping
crab off the bottom that's exactly right
Tom says put the GPU in the dishwasher
yeah I'm not gonna wait for a full cycle
rinse I just think that's a little over
Oh
let's stick with toilet paper no yeah
yeah doing that live - I think they'd be
even worse oh gosh let's go ahead and I
mean yeah you know there aren't even
another are I have to take these thermal
pads which do not look like they're in
good shape I'm gonna recycle these as
well
whoo this is gonna be cringy but we got
to do it so let's try to match up the
coolers we also have to change the
backplate out remember that
so actually what this cooler still has
this thermal pad there so we can keep
that there but some of these other like
I think these are around chokes and the
MOSFETs we're gonna go ahead and pull
these off you can't even see that there
we go now go ahead and pull these off
and just kind of mirror it yeah I can
just put it on the board well just put
it on the board you guys can see where
I'm putting them I want to say there we
go
oh we're missing that last one now
no really shouldn't be touching this
stuff with my hands either oils aren't
good but whatever
yeah Spyder says replace all thermal
pads I don't have any thermal pads I
just said that so I'm just winging it
I'm winging it laughs folks you're gonna
probably cringe just a bit but it's okay
um I don't know where these pads went
I'm gonna cover as much as possible we
just want something there yeah it's good
god these look ugly you need some ugly
thermal pads ah see what else do we have
up there I think that one just
straight-up ripped just place it
casually right there yeah it looks like
that's where it is and right there yeah
you could you could not fall that'd be
cool chill chill all right there we go
okay yep everything's looking alright
ish I guess and all right go ahead and
rip it last I'm gonna do gotta remove
this back pleat so the one that fits in
the aerocart is not the same as the one
that fits it's not shaped the same so
we're gonna have to remove this and swap
it with the one that's on the dead board
just you know full-on parts swap here by
the way if you guys have an idea of
where I should send my gtx 1070 fe dead
board I don't know what about it is dead
I'm not too sure it's possible that
maybe something was stripped back when I
was swapping this the three or four
times that I did it I mean I know you're
not gonna see much here but the the
front and back looked fine I've
literally scanned almost every single
little component on this board front
back and I can't find anything that
looks dead unless its internal maybe
it's in the the PCB it's a four six
layer PCB I'm not sure what how many
layers this is probably more than that
and then maybe something like it could
be a just a bad cap or whatever we can't
actually see from the top but I'm going
to keep removing this here and what does
remiss in do you have to remove these
two additional screws hex heads that
secure the DVI port ah cam says he's
never seen a component that he didn't
want to fix all right I like that
mentality there's the backplate whatever
you really want to call this rear i/o
plate and check out how naked our board
looks now does that look stupid or what
oh gosh
so yeah let's go ahead and put this on
the well we don't need to put this on
the old board because the old board is
already dead so we'll just take the old
boards rear i/o plate this is the one
that's compatible with arrow card pretty
much secure the same way three Phillips
screws and then two hex screws feels
like a lineup that Linus text tips video
with a do as I say not as I do think
yeah I mean like look I don't like this
is not like the proper obviously ideal
conditions would be like if you had
brand new thermal compound and you
cleaned everything up the isopropyl
alcohol I made it look very shiny and
then you didn't recycle thermal pads I
really don't care I mean this blower
card is like the blower itself is
probably going
be the thing that restricts this card
more than anything else Oh am I gonna be
a hand tighten this or Hanley's in these
I don't think so I got to get a tool
I'll be right back
I've got one in the closet here okay got
a pair of surgical tweezers now I know
this is like totally unconventional but
I'm telling you these things work
wonders all right they get you into
those fine places you can lock them in
with the teeth up top you got a death
grip folks that's what you want
sometimes I know this is not this is not
technically the way you're supposed to
do this but all I need is that first
little bit to give there we go and then
I can hand you some the rest of it there
we go so them both these come off a back
plate or just fall I should probably
move the piece to be underneath it I
think that'd be a smart smart choice wow
that's a lot bigger I just hold it over
here last one yeah John I just said that
I already have a mod Matt doesn't fit on
the desk
I said that like ten minutes ago okay so
there's the second Ryo back plate good
to go I am yeah this is the board that's
dead again can't find too much
physically I mean physically it looks
okay so there's something either
internal in the PCB and one of the
layers or just something in one of the
chips one of the caps or something along
those lines it's dead so I may be
another video or maybe I'll just send
that off to somebody to have it fixed so
this is the the arrows back plate we're
gonna align it up so you guys can see it
it's gonna fit no wrong way it's all
right gonna fit basically just like that
yeah and go ahead and use the screws
from
the kid we just released start with a
DVI port it seems like the most secure
wow this is difficult to do I have to do
this straight up let's try it like that
probably be out of shot let me see we're
moving further into the camera
no it's way far away from me rip that
one okay yeah I'm not sure if Brian has
the soldering equipment necessary to fix
some small component on these parts
believe me if I had if I had the
equipment I try to do it myself I just
don't have the equipment and frankly if
I bought the equipment to do it fine
soldering kids
I just wouldn't I wouldn't use it but
maybe a couple times so gonna get that
back on there okay off to a good start
and rest of these just three of these
holding in the other ports actually
these are over the display ports so
there's one then we'll do two and three
Mike I just said literally two minutes
ago I don't have I have a gamer's nexus
mod Matt it doesn't fit the table and
because of that I put it up it's
actually in the garage right now I fit
my old table but I didn't bring that
with me to the new apartment when we
moved so there you go it's okay
wood is not conducted it's just gonna be
a little louder not worried about this -
yeah we're getting scratched up it's a
cheap table I bought on Amazon okay so
that is that's it that's that rear i/o
plate nice and sturdy now and yeah so
let's go ahead and apply the thermal
compound might clean up that dead GPO
just a little bit more okay I'm just
gonna scrub it with toilet paper yeah
looking good
okay enough and lone wolf lone Wolf's
stuck says here's $2 find a use for it I
suppose alright I appreciate that
Thank You mr. lone wolf assuming you're
a dude
lone wolf stuck I am hopefully not gonna
be stuck with this installation process
I think I have all the screws for this
cooler we're gonna find out very shortly
so this is a cooler again wow it is it's
like a smear from thermal compound I
don't know what that is yeah this is
cooler it's just nasty just old and oh
okay so I'm gonna use thermal grizzly
cryin hot stuff it's right here when we
work with working actually very closely
with thermal grizzly here soon so stay
tuned for that we're gonna test out a
very new product of theirs in a
dedicated video I'm going to apply let's
see you guys might we have to cover the
entire die with that with this stuff so
I imagine it's gonna spread fairly well
I could manually spread it I'm not sure
if I'd want to even bother
oh well wolf says his last name is stuck
your last name is literally stuck I mean
they just roll with it man he's gotta
own it that's at that point unless you
just want a full-out change last name
you just gotta roll with it we're just
gonna stick with that I've done this so
many times and that's gonna be enough
now I'm gonna flatten the board it would
help in this case to put the cooler on
something so that the rear i/o plate can
kind of hang there oh I did not yeah rip
I didn't connect the power cable for the
fan I almost forgot I almost forgot
yeah I looking all right looking all
right not really supposed to lift the
PCB back up when you've already put
thermal compound down but it didn't
really spread very much if we had
already tightened it yeah maybe I'd want
to redo that again this is just for my
own testing here I'll run the temp test
and all that stuff after this we'll see
and we'll see how it feels about there
is no back plate with this card so it is
literally just actually these aren't
even the correct screws I'm using these
screws from the F equal or it's whatever
screw number two okay at this point I
couldn't put it well I still can't cuz
that rear i/o plate hangs a little too
low and do that number two we have three
a psychic I just addressed that
literally like right before you type
that in the chat
maybe you just uh maybe you just saw it
I'm not sure how late the livestream
goes and fourth one I always start with
this first and really you want to cross
thread these you can tighten them a
little more on X pattern so you make
sure that there will paste spread Z
somewhat evenly but in my experience
doing this I mean it it's there's so
much torque in these four screws it
spreads fairly well no matter what okay
go ahead and put the card down and now
we have a ton of these small screws to
take care of again but good thing is not
to worry about the stupid hex screws
like we had seen before
hopefully I have all the screws here as
well I'm actually not sure if I have all
of this now let's see let's let's see
how I guess I got one
one okay I have I have a fairy he I have
a sneaking suspicion I'm not gonna have
all the screws actually a couple of them
fell in a closet when I was picking the
cooler but I ain't really that put all
the screws in the cooler he's probably
one or two hanging out in there we'll
just go find those after the fact I've
been viciously crossed yeah I know
oh gosh everyone's a stickler for
everything that I said yeah cross
threading obviously not yeah I meant
your wink you know you guys know what I
mean yeah this one on this corner should
be a fairly large Phillips screw up here
as well I don't know if it's one of
these we'll see I know this green sis
yeah this is a ugly old green PCV I was
one of the reasons why I made a
dedicated video on ours was I come on
like if you're willing to cheap out just
the tiniest bit for the green substrate
over it's not even really the PCP that
screen it's actually a coating the
screen over these any any color you see
over the actual silicon the PCB is just
no semiconductor now we're gonna have
all the screw on we might actually have
all the screws that'll be that'll be
something folks yeah that thing is fugly
she's fugly all right she's that awkward
middle child keeping it down I don't
think we're gonna have the four screws
that lock this in that for sure I don't
think we have but I don't I don't
actually think maybe I'm wrong but I
don't think there were screws in the
back of this cooler when I first pulled
it out of the Dell desktop I'm pretty
sure and I say that not only because I
feel like I didn't
it'd be weird to lose just those but I'm
also saying that because these four
screws here kind of doing the same job
these four words this is just for more
tension on that area I don't think we
yeah I don't think we need to worry
about that and then one more actually
about two more am i missing another hole
somewhere oh no I just see maybe heck
maybe I did lose these that means I lost
three of them where the heck did three
of those go oh there is one more over
here hmm all right I was all of them
interesting is this even gonna thread
over here oh that actually works okay
all right it's kind of poke and hope
with this and we're gonna be too short I
don't think I have I yeah I really don't
think I have the other two I don't think
I have other than the other two and even
like another box yeah exactly like Chris
says you really don't need them because
you already have the four big ones doing
most of the work I'll just keep them in
there just the two that we have and the
other two can just I don't know if you
just here's all you have to do with this
card it still doesn't look pretty from
this side right I mean it's yeah like
fake helo carbon-fiber stickers and
plastic like okay but it's still not a
super appealing card in my opinion but
it looks significantly better if you
placed it in a vertical brackets where
only this side is facing the left panel
versus if you have it plugged in like
this you know plug straight into the
motherboard you're gonna see that PCB
and that's when people you know look
this could be a 1080 or a 1070 either
cooler works the efi boards are
basically the same so you could you
could just pop a 1080 in here and turn
it vertical with a vertical bracket and
from cable mod coolermaster whoever and
then just let this thing look semi
pretty you know it's gonna look a lot
better than that bare green PCB showing
on the back so I definitely recommend a
verdict
bragging for this card but you know
apart from that and maybe the fact that
it's gonna run a little loud a little
hot this isn't too bad
I think this bike here if I recall Korea
it's been like a year since I tested
this car in a video
I think this card hit about a TC under
load maybe a little higher but the way
NVIDIA is throttling works they get kind
of throttles itself throughout the
entire frequency range and at
temperatures above 70 degrees Celsius
I'm not sure exactly what it is but as
these cards get hotter and video kind of
a you know it compensates by adjusting
this the memory frequency or the the GP
frequency directly and so they they will
typically run around eighty degrees
these blower style cards still a bit
still so yeah I would say this thing's
good to go I'm not sure is that like
painters that I was a piece of paper or
something also what the heck is this
piece of thermal pad whatever
rip rip that will be sure to run
temperature tests with this thing just
to make sure I got to do my due
diligence especially if I plan on using
this in the future build I'd say it's
pretty good I mean this side anyway
again a vertical brag gonna do the job
so that's about it folks just want to
show you guys what I what I do this is
again this is just stuff that I'm gonna
be using in house so I'm not really
worried about it you know standing the
test of time which is why I didn't
bother buying new thermal pads or
anything like that i thermal pads would
be nice and that would certainly keep
temps down and around the the VRMs and
the memory but you know we have new
thermal compound on the GPU and I think
that's gonna keep GP temps in check at
least somewhat the blower stock card is
gonna be our weak link for sure but yeah
so what do you guys think and I even
staring at a desk this entire time but
this was kind of fun you know and look I
could have made a dedicated video of
this instead I decided a livestream it
so you get to see all the get to see the
whole thought process right play out
I've been kind of talking this whole
time so you don't get bored of just
watching me screw stuff in but yeah so I
think this will stand the test of time
like I said at least for the time
gonna be using it and maybe not four or
five years from now but you could always
swap thermal compound put new pads on
this thing should be good to go again
and the PCB is really the only thing
that's keeping me from just outright
wanting to throw this in $1,000
you know PC or something like that let's
see if I can find these online because
these aren't technically you can't
really buy these I mean you could buy a
card similar to this but I know MSI is
uses a darker PCB similar to the FE card
like this and they also have MSI logo
and they they here they're not using as
cheap a plastic like this is like really
cheap plastic here and the MSI card
didn't give me that didn't give me that
vibe so who knows well we'll have to see
my phone just turned off but I'm going
to take the time now to answer some
questions if you guys have any I know
you're just staring at a desk I guess I
could kind of turn it toward me the
camera if you are really into seeing me
but and try my best here to point the
camera up see how messy it is
I need to activate Windows there like
that good I think we looking there a
little closer this is such a weird angle
I'm gonna be looking up the entire I
don't know if you heard what I said I my
computer I gotta activate Windows on it
I put the I put two drives in raid 0 and
I've been they've been doing alright I
mean since since I did it which was like
four months ago I want to say it's been
doing fairly well so I mean it's really
fast every now and then I get some weird
corruption error especially with Steam
games but I'm not sure if that's just
Steam related or if it does have
something to do with the drives
themselves the raid or Windows 10 just
not know communicating properly with a
read we will see excuse me okay so
heater answer your questions folks
whatever you got I have literally the
chat pulled up right here my phone and
I'm just staring at it so if you guys
have questions if I know the answer I'll
try to answer as best incoherently as I
can in a short amount of time and if I
don't know the answer then maybe I'll
make a video when I hear something like
that I often do some research and get
back to you guys and honestly any idea
this point is good for a video let's see
here but lone wolf wants to know if I
played war thunder before the answers
and no I never even heard of that game
before or another thing a lot of games
that sound alike so maybe I've heard of
it or maybe even I played it I played a
lot of games just a benchmark and tests
with but I don't recall that one let's
see Tom Brown what a gtx 1070 TI be a
good upgrade for from an RX 570 sure
would it depends on what you get it for
I wouldn't pay any more for a 1070 TI I
definitely wouldn't pay more than if
you're buying used about 280 to 300
bucks I don't know I don't know about
the use markets change recently it used
to be you could get 10 70s for like a
like well not a hundreds of them about
200 bucks 200 to 240 dollars with a
sweet spot for the 10 70s and the 1080
we're going for about 300 to 350 bucks I
know that because I bought several those
cards when they were that price but it
might have changed the 1070 though 1070
I will be a very nice upgrade from a 517
but but but uh Wes Wes says no no no no
turn the camera back alright here's the
solution I get to do all I got to do
just look away from the screen you can
just hear my beautiful voice there's
there's the fix okay we have Adrian
Lopez is it possible to replace a sensor
my old mouse my final mouse Urgo is died
and I can't find a replacement at
reasonable price yeah I don't know if
they sell those things separately it
really dependent if it was like a port
like I don't know if they sell sensors
I've never looked for a sensor to
replace it in a mouse and it would have
to be the exact same sensor I assume and
I'm not sure if those things are just
like plug and play with the boards so
it's really in a dependent how much
working on doing how much time you want
to spend looking for that because if
it's if they sell them out right then
yeah quick swap but I'm just not sure if
they do let's see but the hack daemon do
they make water box a twenty seven ta
suits dual I don't know about that blog
in particular I mean you can have to
type it in on Google that's really the
best answer half for yeah I don't know
about that particular card usually the
more beefy cards get the the waterblock
action so if it's not a very beefy 2017
probably not but maybe not the dual I
know the Strix does 20 70 Strix I'm
pretty sure does but I'm not sure about
the the Asus dual let's see here
really have here another one from tom
water cooling your air cooling depends
on the application air cooling is just
easier but water cooling I mean AIO is
for the most part they're gonna last you
I would say several years safely if you
have anything go wrong with a banana
it's gonna be a dead pump and you'll
know it's a dead pump your temperatures
will spike and you'll have no idea why
and your yeah yo fans will still turn
you like why the heck is that doing that
out with a CPU fan I mean the air cooler
sorry a CPU air cooler it's just yeah if
the fans turning the CPU cool is working
right so so they're less failure points
and in some situations air coolers can
be even quieter than liquid cooled
counterparts
I'm just depends I think in general I
think a I always look better so if it's
an aesthetic thing to and you're not
really as concerned about budget then I
would say water cooling is the way to go
but there are a lot of really good air
coolers out there for under fifty bucks
you know so it just depends but big or
bouzouki there's a last name ray tracing
on Pascal what performance to expect and
the answer to that is I have no earthly
idea I just know that when I when you
when you think about how intensive that
is to begin with just enabling something
like DXR or even DL SS it wealthy LSS to
an extent helps but it can sometimes
drop the indie game quality right
because it's an AI oh it's it's an AI
that's a learning over time so
theoretically the the picture in game
should look better a year from now than
it does right now right that's the
benefit of the LSS so it's kind of
sudden you have to buy into long-term
with the XR turning on or H racing in
games it's just I mean there's a reason
why Nvidia packed RT in tensor cores in
tutoring cards and the fact that Pascal
cards don't have that I'm very skeptical
as to whether or not that performance
will even be somewhat satisfactory
seeing as though the 20 DTI still takes
an absolute pounding when d XR is
enabled in most of the games that
support it which today is only like a
handful of games and I think that even
isn't over
damn it but uh let's see here 11 1 2 3
what's the max temp my Strix 1080 T I
should get a Strix 10 82 TI oh I haven't
tested ass tricks today GT I can tell
you my 1080 T eyes don't get butt to
around low to mid 70s shouldn't get much
higher than that you can overclock a bit
no but you'll probably hit your power
limit pretty fast I'm well I know you're
hitting power them at some Turing cards
but I'm not sure if you did it on a
strict 1080 but usually what you can do
is just max everything on an MSI
Afterburner just kind of let the card
handle itself you know just increase the
power limit voltage limit if you really
want to get fancy and all that good
stuff you can you can even fine-tune the
frequency to maybe it's been a while
since I've even overclocked graphics
cards let's just say you're out of the
box max boost is like 2,000 megahertz
you might be able to get 2,100 maybe
2200 if you got a really good sample
but of course that scales from card to
card so it might differ for a different
version of a card different PCB could
just be a you know totally different
family of graphics card so they'll all
have different stable frequencies and
you kind of gotta fill it out let's see
here uh hey it's pretty good green PCB
YUM yeah we just finished doing that oh
god I probably just broke it with my
ring be careful with that one of the
reasons why I like back plates it's not
so much the aesthetics anymore it used
to be just purely aesthetic but there is
actually a functional purpose so yeah
let's see ya Hayden says just got here
did he just finish and the answer to
that is yes so just finished the camera
was pointing at the desk for about 45
minutes or so but the tech Crimson says
the camera angle is definitely
interesting yeah that's because I just
turned the camera facing us if you just
join the livestream then yeah you're
probably like what the heck is he doing
with the camera way up there but it's
better than you guys having a way for me
to move the tripod awkwardly and fix the
like Heights and all that good stuff
I've scrolling down a little bit more
here ooh West West 0 when do you think
in da storage will be wait when do you
think DNA storage will be in scuse me
and could it be in common being being I
went Bing and builds oh no wait time I
west but I've never heard of that but
but TechCrunch says guess this means you
need to make an updated video on how to
overclock a graphics card I mean it's
the exact same process so I haven't done
an updated version of it because it's
literally this I recommend using MSI
Afterburner
it's extremely simple to do and you kind
of got to play with the tolerances again
it's just like with a CPU you know every
cards gonna overclock just slightly
different hmm Tom Brown when you think
of epic games I really I don't get much
into the games thing I just I play pub G
a lot I play City skylines a lot Call of
Duty GTA 5 it's really about it it takes
a lot for me to swap from game to game
because it's a commitment you know when
you commit to one game for me that's a
serious thing and you just got to stick
with it for a long time kind of
perfected as much as you can and then
once you get bored of that then you can
move on to something else I'm still not
bored yet of pub G even though they came
it's just a hecka unoptimized still it's
a lot better than it was but it still
got problems I'll play Call of Duty just
a wreck some kids you know short little
30-minute session here
about Texas guys guys the only plays
puffy it's true I really only do that's
really true yeah okay Alex write 3000
series risin + r9 290x custom water a IO
or new GPU
yeah dude if you're gonna write if
you're an upgrade to rising 3000 I would
definitely drop that r9 290x you just
you're with a hawai'i architecture or
Tahiti is a Hawaii or Tahiti
I think it's Hawaii no maybe it's to
remember one of the two I know it's
wanted to anyway yeah that's an old
architecture 99 TX is around the hot so
you're okay with card running really hot
in your system that's fine but it really
could go a long way if you upgraded to
hack I mean even like Vega 56 like you
can get a Vega 56 card now for like
three hundred bucks and yeah like three
aims with it that's a really good value
so if you're not buying a little r-tx
thing you're not an Nvidia fan or
whatever and I think Vega 56 is a very
compelling offer right now you can even
find some used cards for I would say
less than that so if you're diligent
you'll find good deals yeah 290x is
Hawaii all right thank you Chris I
appreciate that the strength power
performance okay what happened to the
mini PC so I ended up tearing it all
apart like I like I said only reason why
is because I I just I don't know I think
I'm gonna end up swapping the cooler
anyway the CPU cooler knocked was gonna
send one of their super low profile
cooler so to be even quieter for for
Lisa's mom and then I'm waiting on an
tech to reply about that Pete that power
supply board so it was definitely the
board that power was reaching the board
we confirmed that in the video it just
wasn't getting through the board to the
did it wall to the outlet to the poor
that split it between the 24 pin 8 pin
and then the SATA and molex so an
unfortunate ending there but at least we
got the troubleshoot a little bit but
the but let's see here
I am going to hey says Megan 56 is still
$400 in the u.s. it was not very
recently and it will come down again I
promise you
vega 56 we just ran an ad for vega 56
for the red dragon from power color you
could get that thing for like 330 bucks
and you got three good game like they
were good games think it was Division
two Devil May Cry 5 and Resident Evil 2
good games all three of those with like
$150 value plus the graphics card for
329 so definitely not just $400 it comes
down quite a bit
let's see here lone wolf says how's
school going I graduated I graduated my
engineering degree like two years ago
and then I graduated with my MBA I was
it six months ago I'm like that trying
to read my diploma and see if I might
have pull my degree and see if it has it
on there there is no date I know it is
okay 14th day of December 2018 yeah so
that was three or four months ago
so yes school is good topher tech good
question Greg what's in your rig the
answer to that is well and my personal
rig has a r-tx 27 t in it and I $9.99
hundred K 32 gigs of tritons e ddr4 so
that's what I'm rocking and I'm looking
at what else I have in the system I have
a courser H 150 I Pro it's an NZXT h h
700 i and a alright and eb g a p2 1001
there we go okay i took me while i was
trying to remember trying to remember
all the stuff in the rig I have this rig
over here too and this is actually the
one I'm streaming from so right now I'm
streaming with an i5 8600 k 16 gigs of
course there Dom plots
and an RT x26 TFE and the RT x 2060
right now is actually doing all the
encoding for this video
so OBS recently added the improved
Nvidia encoder tools and then also
stream labs OBS just added I use stream
labs mostly because I can do like the
ticker and stuff I don't have it for
this video because it's a different
computer I have to set it all up again
but the 26 he's doing very well right
now with that and I have to check GPU
usage to see exactly what's what but I
know my CPU right now I see that CPU
usage is 4% and I'm streaming it a bit
rate of 10,000 megabits per second so
she's doing alright right now but I
probably do a separate video on that to
talking about actually at 20 70 20 to be
a lot better for this though 26 he's
doing just fine so I'll probably do a
video on that talking about the
different scaling just the usage overall
comparing the XT x264 software and
coding to the hardware and coding on the
Nvidia card and we'll just see but see
you a couple more questions folks
anything else anything juicy you'll want
to ask me before I leave it's 10 o'clock
over here 10 p.m. Central Standard Time
look in the chat look in the chat
hey says power color Vega feed 6 on new
egg and Amazon are nowhere near 3:30
yeah that's because they were for 3:30
like a month ago so you can tell me
they're not now that's fine I'm not
arguing that they're that they are now
they were just on sale very recently I
know that's because I literally ran ads
for them and it was a really good deal
for 330 you're basically getting the
graphics card for like 250 bucks it was
really good and I like I said it will
come down again so if you want a card
right now don't buy bag of 56 obviously
but if you want to wait a little bit
I'm sure Vega 56 will come down
significantly in price again like it did
before and I'm sure someone will hit me
up to run a pre-roll or two on it as
well just to draw traffic but Tom Brown
you wanted the roast of Linus I don't
know is that a delta X if it's a if it's
a delta X I'll be there so that'll be
fun I don't know else it would be
let's see yeah someone says do you
really need to change thermal paste or
sorry thermal pads if you open your GP
for paste replacement not really I mean
you really don't need to it's just good
practice to once they get dirty and your
oils from your hands get on them and
stuff it can inhibit heat transfer but
ultimately the thermal paste is what's
really gonna make or break you just want
to make sure that that there are thermal
pads in place obviously for this
solution like these thermal pads are
really ugly so I would have I would have
swapped those in an ideal situation I
don't have any on hand and this is a
card I'm gonna be using for my own
purposes so it's it's I'm not worried
about it we have a new member by the way
we have Roger Walsh Wahlstrom oh if I
said that correctly I hope I did welcome

Thank You Roger and greetings from in
the US of A Stream wants to know how old
I am I am thorough I am 24 I almost at
34 Jesus not that old I am 24 and I will
turn 25 in October end of October all
right javi the Andrus is have you seen
in videos April Fool's video I have not
that Suns are really good I'm definitely
gonna have to check that out if it's
from Nvidia it's gonna be juicy what's
the best $50 graphics card eh I have to
do my research I can't answer that and
it really depends on the market as well
if you could only afford one quality
peripheral for gaming so I'm assuming
you're like you're saying if I could
only get one really good peripheral and
the rest of the peripherals have to kind
of suck which would it be a mouse and
then okay a keyboard or a better
keyboard
okay Mouse okay so I have used membrane
keyboards a lot in the past pretty much
growing up like even my own personal pcs
use membrane keyboards which is site I
had to buy everything on the pocket I
was really on tight budgets back then so
I only use membrane keyboards granted I
use cheap mice too but I think the mouse
matters a little more for the games that
I play and I just prefer more
comfortable smooth mice with better
sensors in them and more accurate and
more responsive so I would say in
general I'd pick a better Mouse and go
with the just a trashy keyboard if I had
just just for my personal application I
think it would fit let's see here
gee rut says I am so late to the stream
oh yes sir
a good thing is gonna be archived if you
wanna go back and watch any of it I mean
we just would just basically swapped we
swap our sorbitol most in power supplies
we just swapped the PCB from the
founders Edition card this was actually
where the PC was originally it was
originally on this blower card but my Fe
Board died but I wanted to use the FE
cooler so I took this green PCB from
this 1070 and put it on the FE card or
the FE cooler so we were swapping that
back in this video just because the FE
cooler was painted and it's a little
messy and yeah so all righty folks you
guys have been awesome we're gonna sign
out here if you are interested in
checking out some of our most recent
content I encourage you to do that I
mean look it's not gonna cost you
anything unless you have YouTube premium
I guess I've cost you well you might as
well get your money's worth a baby to
premium watch as many videos as you can
but I'd appreciate it if you'd check out
a video or two on the channel we're
gonna come with some really cool content
here soon I have a very special CP from
Intel that I will be doing a dedicated
video on also two graphics cards that
were sent from gigabyte we'll be doing
reviews on and then also a balanced PC
build I think it's important that we
stress in the balanced aspect of this
build coming up because it's very easy
for me just to throw a bunch of
expensive gear in to Rick and say oh
check out this ultimate gaming PC $2,000
$3,000 whatever
we're gonna do a balanced $1,000 budget
build and I think that budget is a sweet
spot for a lot of people because it's a
compromise between spending outrageous
sums of cash for marginally better
performance in most cases and spending
two or three hundred dollars for really
crappy performance right so a thousand
bucks I think is a really good sweet
spot you can get a lot of performance
for a thousand bucks of a gaming system
and we're gonna talk about those pros in
in the video coming up so who knows we
might even use one of the graphics cards
we were sent one of the either the 1660
of it or the ti in that build as well I
haven't fully decided yet my play around
a PC part picker and see what we can do
so we will uh yeah we'll be ready to go
and those videos stay tuned for that
again check out some more older content
I appreciate you guys watching I'm gonna
have to pivot over here to end the
livestream so it's gonna be a little
awkward but again thank you for taking
time out of your Sunday night and/or
Monday morning slash afternoon to be
here this is science video thanks for
watching thanks for swapping PCBs with
this I'll catch you in the next one and
here's the awkward slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
