do and I have something a little
different here to show you I picked up
something on newegg that I think is
worthy of a video now at first glance
you might not think so just because of
well how simple it isn't and what it
does it's actually a USB thumb drive now
I know right off the bat what you're
thinking well come on Greg it's a USB
thumb drive those are like household
items like people just don't make videos
on thumb drive as well I think this one
is worthy of a video now a typical thumb
drive is going to look something like
this now I am going to pick on sandisk
in this particular video but most USB
thumb drive manufacturers are guilty of
this sin so they all look just boring I
think this one just looks terrible most
college and high school students tend to
keep their USB thumb drives on their
keys so I don't think I'm going to want
to have this on my keys and if I am it's
not something that I'm going to be
wanting to show off yeah you got a cool
looking thumb drive there right now it's
got a cheap little lever here that
slides the USB drive in and out of the
plastic housing and listen to it just
sounds cheap it's just it's literally
made of plastic and I don't like it
there is a little orange LED in here
that I should note but I mean come on
it's it's nothing impressive it looks
orange when it's plugged in that's great
also these things can get snagged
sometimes when this lever is pushed out
and you try to insert it into a computer
this lever will just not stick anymore
and then the USB Drive will just get
pushed back in that sucks that's
annoying now other USB thumb drive
manufacturers have resorted to the mini
approach write something small something
that you can't even see this thing's
purpose is to be small but it's to be
small because well nobody wants to sue
them right so they've gone from
something this big and bulky and ugly to
something this small because they
decided that well the first time around
people just didn't like them at all so
they said well okay we'll just make them
as small as possible with it well you
can't see them and you can't judge them
therefore soapy and wise kind of tried
to get away with this i actually
purchased this from my old xbox 360 this
was a storage device believe it or not I
actually put GTA 5
data on this thing but since then I have
just used it for I don't know driver
data and whatnot but now I just kind of
sits around because I have upgraded to
something even cooler and yes it's
bigger it's much bigger than this I
think that the thumb drive i'm about to
show you is very very cool and worthy of
the keychain so go ahead and show it to
you this one is from kingston now the
first thing you might notice about
something like this is wow it's very
small small not in the wit factor but in
the haight factor how does something
this small work well actually the entire
thing is the thumb drive so this entire
unit is what is inserted into the USB
port on your computer or laptop that is
pretty cool it's also gold of all colors
I think gold is a very classy and mature
color so if you're looking for something
that looks a bit more professional I
think that gold kind of beats out a
clear grey and black so gold's nice to
see now the material the kingston use in
this case feels like aluminum I know I
say that about pretty much any metal at
all but it certainly is a metal of sorts
it's not a plastic so you don't have
look at really can't hear anything it's
metal it's literally just one solid
piece of it so cool thing about this is
my keys here there's a ring here and
this ring is also made of the same metal
it's again one solid piece of metal and
it will fit on pretty much any key chain
look at that look at that come on that
looks cooler than the keys on my
keychain now this particular thumb drive
is only a USB to point at them dry which
means that you're not going to see the
stellar speeds that you would otherwise
see from a USB 3.1 drive but there's a
reason I went with USB 2.0 con computers
quite a bit nowadays and when I'm
installing things on computers that
aren't necessarily the newest and best
and most up-to-date I need USB to point
out because I have found that older
computers do not like dealing with USB
3.0 Ives they just they just don't for
some reason they're supposed to be
backwards compatible
but there are still problems every now
and then I ran into a particular one
with an old intel celeron platform from
the Asus lineup and it just would not
detect thumb drive at all in the system
BIOS so I've done with this one and it
seemed to fix my problems for the older
pcs that I work with you can find this
particular kingston 16 gigabyte USB 2.0
let's see DTG e9 and it's 32 and 64
gigabyte older brothers on newegg right
now so that's about it everyone i want
to show you that you can actually bring
the coolness out of your USB thumb drive
just ditch the old one you have that
ugly plastic big bulky one or that very
minimalistic hard to see small one get
something that looks great on a keychain
get something that looks like it belongs
on your keychain something like this
kingston USB to point out okay that it's
not USB 3.0 unless you're dealing with
huge files which at that point I don't
even recommend using USB thumb drive for
anyway so that's about it everyone if
you liked the video give us a thumbs up
if you hated the video right and think I
should never do this again give me a
thumbs down in the comments below let me
know what you would like to see next
also if you think you have a cooler
thumb drive than this one I dare you to
challenge me be sure to this your thumb
drives name make model color and phone
number in the comments below I dare you
challenge me there's nothing cooler than
this kingston DTG 9 16 gigabyte USB 2.0
drive on a keychain that's it everyone
