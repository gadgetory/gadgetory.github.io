break your system well not literally but
you'll regret it for a long time if you
don't do sufficient research beforehand
and it's got to be smart research you've
got to ask yourself the right questions
perhaps the most important of these in
what resolution do you intend to game
1080p 4k the second question follows
suit at what refresh rate do you intend
to game 60 Hertz 120 240 your answers to
these two questions will define your PC
build without a doubt they'll influence
your CPU choice your power supply choice
and maybe even your case choice a lots
riding on this one here's a quick
rundown picture the graphics card as the
foundation on which all other computer
components rely and if you aren't
interested in discrete graphics for
gaming then your CPU becomes the
foundation it's my personal belief that
your entire budget should revolve around
this graphics card choice which as we
just discussed is dependent on gaming
resolution and refresh rate I should
also mention that these recommendations
assume a minimal CPU bottleneck 16
gigabytes of system ram which should
remove any Ram bottleneck and moderately
demanding current gaming titles so let's
start with the lower end and work our
way up we've got a few contenders way
down at the base of the spectrum
something like this Nvidia g2 10 may
seem appealing on paper thanks to its
extremely low price but you'd almost be
better off sporting just a CPU and your
PC and running off of integrated
graphics in some cases you actually
would be better off no joke serious
gamers even in lower resolutions should
be prepared to spend anywhere from 50 to
100 US dollars at least
that's roughly arcs for 60 territory
just on the upper edge and the arcs for
60 is a much more powerful car than
these two from Nvidia mind you we have
to bump up to the GTX 1050 for a fair
fight from the Green Team so all of
these GPUs fit into what I would call
the 1080p 60fps category as in don't
expect to attain much higher than this
without serious graphical compromises
any resolution below this with modern
games and you should be okay 720p you
should be fine with any of these
graphics cards as long as you're willing
to adjust a few in-game settings the
ten-thirty isn't an interesting price
point but if you AskMe pay a little
extra for the RX 460 or the gtx 10
Fifty's again 1080p gaming here wouldn't
push these cards above that and pairing
either of these with a 144 Hertz monitor
for example wouldn't make much sense
unless the game in question fare
somewhere along the lines of csgo
our next category is the 1080p 1440p
category the cards listed here are very
fluid in that they can easily run a
majority of games in 1080p and even
light 1440p with adjusted settings there
you go dropping texture quality from
very high to high high to normal you get
the point included here are the arcs for
70 through the 580 r9 380 390 and
everything in between along with the gtx
960 1060 and 970 remember that these
aren't absolutes there are certainly
circumstances in which these general
rules are a bit of a stretch but for any
beginner this should give you a good
idea of what to expect I also have
several links to benchmarks down below
to back up these claims all in all
expect to spend anywhere from two to
three hundred US dollars for one of
these cards up next is the 1440p
category the cards listed here are
without a doubt 1440p powerhouses and
can even handle refresh rates exceeding
100 Hertz pushing that 4k boundary
you'll find the gtx 1070 to be an
excellent performer here for the price
as well as the late 1980s umph ssin
should be considered vSphere your lineup
is a great fit here as well and you can
usually pick these up for considerably
less than their Nvidia counterparts see
this video right here for more details
though do keep in mind these cards are
very power hungry you could probably
make the case for the GTX 1080 here as
well seeing it so the 1080 Ti has
lowered prices a bit the 1080 is a large
leap above the 1070 from a performance
perspective but may prove to be a bit
overkill for anyone locked at 60 Hertz
below 4k the last category then is the
4k category up to 120 Hertz if you're
gaming a resolution higher than this or
with multiple monitors you probably
already know what you're doing and
you're just watching this video for sig
kicks which is still cool packed into
here or the priciest of the pricey
graphics cards available and even a few
crossfire SLI configurations for cards
that won't perform up to spec by
themselves first and foremost of the
prominent GT X 1080 Ti is an excellent
4k graphics card even intensive Witcher
3 is crushed by this Nvidia powerhouse
and for around the same price as its 90
DTI counterpart this time two years ago
technology has made leaps and bounds
just two years that's incredible and the
prices haven't gone up accordingly from
AMD it's difficult to recommend anything
reasonably priced at this point since
we're largely anticipating Vega but we
aren't certain of performance numbers
some expect Avego won't touch the 1080i
others wholeheartedly think that it will
but for now as of may 2017 the best I
can do for the red team is recommend the
crossfire configuration to Theory X's
should do the trick but at the expense
of some serious power consumption - GTX
1080s would also work here as well as to
GTX 10 70s though the latter would
certainly struggle with anything above
60 fps in the 4k resolution so that's my
breakdown in my experience when friends
and family asked for gaming advice I
break it down like this identify your
constants or gaming resolution and your
gaming refresh rate and then pick your
graphics card from there everything else
in your PC if it is a gaming PC should
follow suit if you liked this video be
sure to give it a thumbs up thumbs down
for the obstacle to subscribe on if you
haven't already not we'll catch you in
the next video this is science studio
