disclaimer I absolutely respect je 100%
I've looked up with the guys since the
inception of this channel I still do and
much of the work I've done with custom
loops in particular has been import
thanks to his tutorials and guidance and
much like myself Jay's very headstrong
and opinionated I'm sure most of his
followers already know that he isn't
afraid to speak his mind and I think so
people like about him I also respect
that but it doesn't mean that we have to
agree on everything in fact I encourage
disagreement to an extent it promotes
healthy discussion and exchange of ideas
something we don't see much of in modern
politics so in this video I want to
respond to Jay's recent tweet regarding
corporate mining I usually don't do
these kinds of videos but I think this
one beckons a video from me because I
also like to call it like I see it and I
just don't see eye to eye with him here
he said quote Z mine mining farm 1,500
GPUs this is the that I will never
get behind condone endorse etc casual
miners making money off of their idle
time isn't the problem these guys are
the problem and here's my problem with
that
now I get it we're all frustrated with
the current state of graphics cards in
both the new and used markets gtx 1070
still cost what 1080 TI is it at launch
which is just a bit ridiculous and even
the competitively priced cards that
occasionally show up on Amazon and
Newegg go out of stock almost as quickly
as they show up so what should we do
should we blame all miners should we
just a blame the corporation's buying in
bulk
who is the real target here and my
response to Jay on Twitter was this I
have mixed opinions mainly because I
don't want to bombard him with nine
tweets in a row he doesn't follow me I
don't want that and also because I think
it's a difficult topic to discuss or
surmise in a single tweet Jay
immediately resorted to bashing large
corporations right the easy scapegoat
responsible for bolt graphics card
purchases which we know is happening and
saving face with the little guys you and
me right with a brief disclaimer about
how casual minors are not really the
problem but I find this slightly
inconsistent why blame only the large
companies they're the easy scapegoat and
I feel like people do us all the time
without thinking about it if the goal in
the end is the same which by the way is
to make money why should it matter who
is doing it or in what quantity here's
how I see it if we're gonna be
consistent when playing the blame game
we've got to make sure that all parties
involved or at least mentioned or called
out if one person steals fifty bucks
from a person another steals fifty
thousand from a bank should we only
blame the bank thief
I'm using this rather extreme example on
purpose because it seems as though some
of you feel robbed like your precious
graphics cards were manufactured only
for gaming with a strict agreement
attached and that is simply not true
look I want graphics cards for everyone
I'm certainly pro graphics cards if you
want to call it that but I don't want to
profess my pro gamer stance because I
don't think that it should exist gamers
aren't entitled to graphics cards any
more so than the casual or professional
minor it sounds harsh and I know that
most of my viewers are avid gamers I
respect that but I'm not gonna sugarcoat
it you aren't special in the eyes of
Nvidia nor AMD you're just another
customer and at the end of the day as
long as the sales quotas are met papa
green and Mama red are perfectly
satisfied in fact these two peeps are
more interested in their shareholders
than they are in you so Jay we aren't
entitled to anything as gamers now I
know that you know this you're like come
on Greg you're just you're just grants
but when you ward it like this J it
sounds as though you don't by the way I
don't mind I've never mind and I never
will it's also just as hard for me to
get graphics cards let alone for free
now I find it very distasteful for her
he were mine with a bunch of graphics
cards he or she did receive for free but
then again it wouldn't be illegal for
them to do so and the same goes for
these large mining companies at J's
targeting here sure you can be upset you
can even publicize it publicize your
discontent the same way J did but you
can't call them the problem not unless
you're prepared to call all miners the
problem to some extent they want profits
just like the average Joe who mines with
a single R X 480 does in fact I'd argue
that manufacturers are more at fault
here than the consumers so let's shift
to that for a second
consumers are just doing what consumers
are allowed to do but if Nvidia or AMD
cared that much about their gamers
they'd eliminate bulk purchase options
for unaffiliated businesses and find
other ways to ensure that cards went
into gamers hands only which i think is
what many are asking for but I don't
really agree with
so in closing I disagree with J when he
says that larger mining farms are the
problem they're not doing anything
illegal or even unethical they're just a
buying cards I'm certainly not taking
their side and shunning gamers I think
that's ridiculous but I'm not gonna
blame them I think that they're more or
less the effect not really the cause the
way I see it you have to blame the
big-box manufacturers they are the
source they could have chosen withhold
bulk stock from these companies but they
did not because much like mining farms
in question
manufacturers care about profits to
arguably more so than they care about
the little man you and I with that if
you agree with me you can thumb it up if
you disagree you can thumb it down you
can complain in the comments tell me how
wrong I am but at least you know my
stance I'm not anti gamer yes it sucks I
get it but I don't think that the
solution is to blame miners or band
miners or whatever you guys are trying
to propose in the background with that I
will prepare for the minefield that will
be the comments in this video if you
want to subscribe you can do that I'd
appreciate that we do many things other
than just talk in these videos those are
just something I wanted to get off my
chest because it has been bothering me
for quite some time this is science
studio thanks for chatting
