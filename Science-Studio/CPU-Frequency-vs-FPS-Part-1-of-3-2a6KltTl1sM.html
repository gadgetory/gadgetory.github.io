overclock non K Intel skylake CPUs using
the base clock method and yes that's
still possible if you're interested in
how to do that go and click the card
above me and check out that
corresponding video but I started
thinking about the viability of
overclocking particularly from a gamer
standpoint so if all you do is play
video games on your PC should you
consider overclocking I know that
question sounds a little crazy but I
want you to think about it like this
when you increase the voltage of your
CPU during an overclock you're gonna be
decreasing its lifespan on top of that
your C future's gonna run hotter just
how it works and because of that you're
gonna need some form of custom cooling
so there's money involved there's a lot
of risk involved overclocking is a
serious thing you should know what
you're doing before you decide to pursue
overclocking in general so that's what I
want to answer in this video does
overclocking a CPU actually yield higher
frame rates and video games so I ran
through all of my tests using the best
i-5 money can currently buy the i-5 6600
K I paired it with the GTX 970 gigabyte
windforce Edition graphics card running
its stock and the CPU is running at 4.6
gigahertz when I first ran my tests I
down clock the CPU afterwards to 3.6
gigahertz and ran through the exact same
test once again so the frequency of the
CPU is the only variable in this
scenario I want to see if that one
gigahertz frequency difference we deal
with any substantial change in the frame
rates I receive and all of my games that
I've tested so you should expect an
increase in fps right as you overclock
your cpu but I want to see if that
increase if any increase exists at all
is is substantial enough to justify
overclocking a CPU it's essentially what
this video is about so let's go ahead
and see what the results were
so that's that honestly a bit
disappointing I expected a much larger
difference between our 4.6 and 3.6
gigahertz runs of all of these
benchmarks even in games like City
skylines in Grand Theft Auto 5 which are
regarded as much more CPU intensive
those games still really didn't yield
any substantial FPS increase with our
4.6 run versus our 3.6 and I think that
that's has a lot to do with the fact
that we didn't overclock our GPU so even
though some of these games are CPU
intensive they're still going to mostly
rely on the graphics card and because we
didn't change that variable at all and
it's just relying on CPU frequency
overclock it's a bit like a ram
frequency overclock so your graphics
card has its own processor in its own
set of RAM which this the video games
are going to use primarily anyway so
changing these other variables changing
your CPU or Ram frequency all of that
really isn't going to have as much of an
impact on video game performance as
changing your GPU or your vram frequency
would your memory frequency there which
you can change all that MSI Afterburner
by the way very simple to do just just
make sure that you actually know what
you're doing when you slide this parse
left and right I think an important
exception to this rule would be in the
case of the G 32 58 and G 4400 CPUs that
have lower core counts and lower thread
counts will benefit greatly from being
overclocked so if you're looking at
buying a CPU from the Scylla climate
that's not very expensive at all maybe a
G 4400 or an i3 6100 those CPUs would
benefit greatly from being overclocked
but if we're talking about i5 and i7 I
really I don't see the benefits of
overclocking those for the sake of
solely gaming just because you saw in
some of these cases like black ops 3 our
underclock C if you actually have in
higher frame rates than our overclocked
CPU so these you know these results
aren't set in stone but I want you to
take these at face value it's it's it's
really not going to give you that much
of an added benefit in gaming if you're
deciding to purchase an i5 6600 K or 4
just to 6,600 so consider that I would
save that money if I was you and
reinvest that into a more expensive
graphics card where you will definitely
see some big changes in the frame rates
I want to hear from you so let me know
in the comment sections below if you
agree or disagree with my conclusion
based on these results right here be
sure to give the video a thumbs up if
you think it deserves one and give it a
thumbs down if you think it doesn't and
