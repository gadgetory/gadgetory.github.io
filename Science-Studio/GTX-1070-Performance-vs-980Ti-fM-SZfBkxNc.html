graphics cards wasn't really the king
maybe in terms of price but when it came
to performance the aftermarket coolers
of the gtx 980ti of which the titan x
was never allowed to obtain a lab for
spectacular overclocking potential so
much so that even though the TI was
short a few hundred active cuda cores it
actually yielded higher frame rates in
almost every game tested regardless of
the resolution so up until the dawn of
the GT x 1080 the 980 TI was the best
nvidia had to offer and for a price tag
around 600 US dollars today however
there are New Kids on the Block the 1080
blows away the current competition no
ifs ands or buts about it for the 1070
retailing in the mid 400s currently
still offers quite the punch but is it
enough of a punch to knock out Nvidia
zone 2015 title holder as I've
demonstrated in a video which you can
check out currently in the card above me
the 90 DT eyes drop significantly in
price over the past few weeks in fact
you can pick one up for as cheap or
cheaper than the 1070 in a few instances
so with that said let's answer the
question can the savvy gtx 1070
outperform the mighty 980 TI
the 1070 is an overclocking Beast thanks
to my buddy drew who was gracious enough
to bring his EVGA founders Edition 1070
all the way from the beach here to the
studio we'll be able to card swap and
answer this question straight up with
his 1070 or clock to 1900 megahertz at
the core and 4,000 egg Hertz in the
memory check out the intro video by the
way if you haven't already in the card
right here I haven't a shadow of a doubt
that this card is indicative of some of
the best 1070 performers out there even
some of the 10 settings with the
beefiest aftermarket coolers are
overclock out of the box to these
frequencies it's all thanks to invidious
GPU boost 3.0 and to ensure there are
1070 remained at these frequencies we
manually set them in msi afterburner and
consistently monitored temperatures on
the 980ti side we're using an msi gold
edition cooler a core clock of 1530
megahertz and a memory clock of 3500
megahertz
everything else in our testbench will
remain the same we've got an Intel Core
i7 6700 K overclock to 4.6 gigahertz 16
gigabytes of Gil's super loose ddr4
clocked at 3000 megahertz and a fancy
one terabyte Western Digital black
hardest drive for the games we'll be
testing the operating system is loaded
on an SSD I should also note that hard
drives do not affect in-game performance
is the frame rates that you see when you
actually playing the game they will
affect load times however so if you're
swapping between maps or loading a game
from the start having those games stored
on a solid-state drive will drastically
reduce those load times but the frame
rates will be equivalent so with that
let's have at it let's start off with
heaven benchmark this benchmarking tool
stress is only the graphics card and in
this case the two cards are pretty much
neck-and-neck
the 980ti edges at a very very minor
wind but this is within our margin of
error across the board our minimums
maximums and averages were essentially
in a deadlock in case number 2 with city
skylines a rather CPU intensive game we
found the 1070 polling ahead by quite a
margin while this may not seem apparent
from the averages our minimums and
maximums were noticeably and even
visibly higher during gameplay this is
more evident in our frame rate trendline
across the board whether we were zoomed
out or zoomed way in the Pasco
architecture was winning through and
through the 90 DTI wasn't far behind but
when it comes to zooming in close and
forcing high detailed textures to show
up the faster clock speeds and more
efficient architecture edged out a clear
win for the 1070 however when it came to
GTA 5 things became well vague the
average frame rate differential between
both cards was within the margin of
error and
mins and maxes didn't clear things up we
even framed scaled to twice the
resolution of 1080p and the cards were
still neck and neck
and while the GTX 1070 does boast an
additional two gigabytes of vram pushing
the load anywhere above six gigabytes
resulted in undesirable frame rates
meaning that the 980ti could still play
ball when it comes to grand theft auto
both cards win the tides turned in ashes
of the singularity the 980ti is the
clear winner in this round boasting an
average 9% FPS increase over the 1070
the case was the same for total war
Warhammer a game only released one month
ago the average frame rate difference
was four and a half and our mens were
two frames higher as well for the TI if
you're wondering how we benchmarked
Warhammer we ran the same battle for
each card and variably zoomed in and out
of the center of the battle pivoting and
flying along the way while we know these
aren't exact replicas the two benchmarks
for this game do remember that your own
gameplay won't be the same every time
either and besides four frames for an
average is a lot to make up for we do
the same thing for city skylines by the
way if you're wondering how the two
cards hold up in DirectX 12 mode not to
worry we have two games up and ready for
you the first was rise of the Tomb
Raider while the game itself isn't known
for its fantastic optimization qualities
just yet being so nothing else was
changed between these tests the results
are still fair and indicative of first
hand performance the 980ti one this one
handily across the spectrum and brought
with it an extra five frames when it
came to minimums we expect that newer
drivers from Nvidia in the future will
optimize a 1074 better DirectX 12
performance but for now the Ti takes the
cake
as for hitman a game originally designed
around AMD platforms things were in a
deadlock once more average frame rates
were almost identical as where the men's
rather low minimums notably again
DirectX 12 should in theory correct a
few of these frame dips especially for
the 1070 although it should be noted
that AMD will always have a bit of an
edge here thanks to Hardware driven
asynchronous compute capabilities
whereas in video cards yes even the 1070
rely on the CPU in a much more dependent
way for this execution
we'll see what NVIDIA has in store for
Pascal to correct this quote-unquote
problem in summary I'm calling this one
a tie at least for the two cards we
tested with if you plan on purchasing a
1070 with a beefier aftermarket cooler
which might cost a bit more I might add
then sure the 1070 will win across the
board but not by much save a few games
where the 1070 stepped on the gtx 980ti
games like city skylines in Grand Theft
Auto 5 the same goes for water cooling
in this regard even heaven Bench
arghhhh yielded well results that appear
to mirror each other so regardless of
which card you choose your 1080p in
1440p experiences will be roughly the
same but the 1070 of course will consume
much less power costs a bit more or less
in some cases will have to fall over the
prices over the next few months and
perhaps most importantly the 1070 is
more future proof when it comes to both
the driver support and available vram
whatever else you take away from this
video is on you if you liked what you
saw give this thing a thumbs up give it
a thumbs down if you look at the
opposite or you get everything in my
life click the subscribe button you have
never dean stay tuned for this guy right
here the raid on our X 480 which I'll be
benchmarking and uploading results for
very very soon folks this is science
studio I don't want to drop that thing
thanks for learning with this
