six is still a very viable phone in
light of the Samsung Galaxy s8 I know
it's probably the first thing you're
thinking of going into this video
indeed the SA brings a newer faster
processor to the table but when it comes
down to it you're unlikely to notice
much of a difference it's a bit like
what I said regarding the iPhone 7
the fusion a10 chip and there is blazing
fast but the degree to which you'll
notice the upgrade from that of an
iPhone 6s will be very small expect
nothing different here with LG's new
flagship the LG G 6 and in case you're
wondering this is the Platinum color
right out of the box the first thing
you'll notice is the crazy high screen
to body ratio approaching 80 percent at
5.7 inches it's sporting a larger
diagonal display than the samsung galaxy
s7 and the iPhone 7 plus but with a
noticeably smaller frame thanks to the
reduced vertical bezels there's
something about this ratio that makes
this experience seem that much more
immersive you know screens are always
getting larger with respect to their
frame sizes but this really takes the
cake I know the SI it's a bit higher I
think with the screen to body ratio but
this is still phenomenal and it really
does feel like you're just holding the
screen it's something I can't describe
just via video you have to actually pick
one up for yourself and you'll
understand what the hype is all about
and it is real this is this is super
cool and speaking of ratios you'll find
a slightly elongated aspect ratio from
16 by 9 try 18 by 9 a screen that's
twice as long as it is wide although
very few are likely to notice the
elongation where this becomes apparent
is YouTube and video streaming though
you'll have black bars on either side
unless you're viewing an optimized ultra
wide format and those are difficult to
come by nonetheless it's a non-issue in
the long run and the IPS technology
baked in yields some of the darkest
blacks imaginable apart of course from
AMOLED now why PS technology will bring
some of the most accurate color
reproduction to the forefront especially
in this phone which is refined the IPS
tech probably six or seven times already
you will notice one thing that I
consider a downfall and that is a narrow
black bezel that surrounds the screen
just outside the pixels but before you
hit the actual border of the frame where
in this case you'll see the Platinum
surrounding the the phone there is a
very thin buffer zone between those
pixels that do light up and that
platinum background that's that narrow
black bezel it is noticeable it's not
something that you know I regard as a
deal breaker but it is there it's
something that my s7 did not have takes
a tiny bit of getting used
another interesting fact glass up front
is Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and glass on
the back is Corning Gorilla Glass 5 so
interesting take their other
specifications include a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 820 one the same processor
used in the Google pixel for gigabytes
of RAM the new flagship sweet spot and
dual 13 megapixel cameras in the rear a
single 5 megapixel up front let's start
first with performance and work our way
around to the cameras from a software
standpoint this phone is blazing fast
I'm actually pleasantly surprised by how
lightweight LG's user interface is it's
called UX 6.0 and actually resembles
more of an iPhone like setup then a
TouchWiz one which is a good thing in my
book for example you won't find an app
drawer and said you'll be forced to
stockpile unused apps and dusty old
folders but I'm willing to compromise on
that for the sake of not having that
bloatware kind of TouchWiz interface
that I'm used to on the Samsung phones
and I will admit the s8 seems too a
foregone this feature as well now while
this might be a con for many people who
are used to that stock Android
experience they like the app drawers
like the fact that they can customize
pretty much anything that they want on
their screens the UX 6.0 software still
does bring quite a bit to the table I
think those pros do outweigh that single
con for one the minimalistic design
drastically reduces load on the
processor and the RAM I have yet to
encounter a single crash or even delay
at any point during daily use and I've
had this phone for about a week now and
if you're not a fan of the stock design
you do have several to choose from and
LG's Dilton store or just run a
third-party launcher that will tap to
wake the device and use gestures for
additional ease of use Google assistant
is also baked right in which is a super
cool feature it's one of the perks of
having an Android phone check this out
ok Google tell me a joke okay here you
go how does it treat it you choose
surfing the web is seamless multitasking
and screen splitting are both effortless
and even the camera seems to benefit
from the software starting with the rear
you'll find two 13 megapixel cameras but
their specifications do differ ever so
slightly one takes a very wide approach
the other more standard and narrow two
buttons up top allow for a quick change
to the left you'll find more controls
manual settings timers everything you
might expect in an Android flagship and
to the right video and
bill button shots the good thing about
this interface it can be as simple or
complex as you want and that is the joy
of Android in general I'll discuss the
camera in more detail in a dedicated
video probably a head-to-head against
the pixel phone which I would regard as
one of the best phones currently in
terms of camera quality and perhaps the
Galaxy s8 but here are a few stills I
took a few days ago the f1 pointed
aperture on the narrower lens performs
extremely well on low lit places as you
might expect but still introduces quite
a bit of noise as the ISO is bumped up
in the automatic mode just a downside of
a small phone sensor so how I would rate
the rear cameras depends largely on what
I'm actually taking a picture of and
where I'm taking that picture outside in
daylight 10 out of 10 this is probably
the best outdoor camera phone I've ever
seen or used outside at night at 7 out
of 10 the unwarranted grain and reduced
autofocus detection make it difficult to
use but do keep in mind this is the
story with most phones so we can't
really talk up many points for the LG G
6 here inside of a well-lit area again
10 out of 10 even with incandescent
light it's still it's still going to be
top-notch I can't complain about color
reproduction saturation really anything
but take a step into a dark hallway or
somewhere that's not directly lit and
you'll find the ISO again
overcompensating maybe a 6 out of 10
here with respect to my old daily driver
this is my new one by the way the
Samsung Galaxy s7 the low-light
performance on both cameras they're
about on par with each other you'll find
that the apertures are pretty much the
same everywhere the ISO reacts the same
way in auto mode I do like the
customisable manual mode in the s7 user
interface though so that's something
that I would give a perk to the s7 for
but in just general overall picture
quality for sure the g6 has it and the
fact that you get to choose between a
wide and a narrow lens it's just the
icing on the cake if you ask me I think
the g6 is wide option is better than
that of the iPhone 7 plus is dual
focusing setup I think that dual focus
setup is targeted to a very specific
niche audience but in this case with the
wide-angle lens that that can be used by
anybody it's similar to like I don't
know a GoPro effect as for video you can
max out at 4k 30fps or 1080p 60fps which
is my resolution of choice of 60 frames
per second it's just the fluidity you
just can't replace that and you can also
bump it all the way up to 120 fps if
you're willing to drop too
720p I believe with the front-facing
camera it's really nothing special
LG sacrificed pixels in this case for
low-light performance with the up 2.2
aperture I get that there's no flash up
front so that's cool
I suppose if that's what it needs it
also has a wide-angle option though I
would have liked to have seen an 8
megapixel sensor up front you know for
those high def 4 case snapchat selfies
other subdued qualities of the g6
include water and dust proof nough so I
don't recommend using it underwater and
please keep it out of the ocean salt
water accelerates corrosion but using it
in the rain and even in the shower if
you want I don't know if you want to be
that kind of person should be fine if
it's casual just keep it casual the g6
is speakers are also pretty good better
than my s7 s and actually approaching my
iPhone 7th quality I'd say it's directly
in between have a listen so what's your
friend's birthday how do you find the
perfect gift
download the Amazon app and let it find
you Justin your mom
now if you're worried about battery
lights don't be I'm consider myself a
power user and I can get through a full
day easily with this phone I can
probably stretch to two days if I really
tried but for example last night I went
to bed after waking up at 8 a.m. using
the phone all day I still had I think 55
percent battery life left you can see
here's a clip of just overall battery
usage for today it's currently about 2
p.m. as of time of filming now it's no
iPhone 6 plus the 3300 milliamp hour
battery on a operating system that's
actually pretty conservative when it
comes to battery consumption is plenty
for this phone again I put my seal of
approval on the battery life you don't
have anything to worry about here but
even if that won't cut it the USB type-c
quick charger will deliver a 50 percent
charge in a matter of around 30 minutes
or so that's not an exaggeration in fact
if you're around a 0% battery when you
first plug in your phone expect near 30
percent charge in about 15 minutes and
that's how quick charge technology works
when you first plug in your phone it'll
send more power than normal to your
battery upfront for the first 15 minutes
or so that's why your phone will charge
very quickly for that first 15 minutes
or 20 minutes and then it'll slowly back
off that power to a more conservative
amount after that time just to relieve
the stress on the battery the phone also
won't heat up quite like others when
quick charging though I can't attest to
whether that's the result of the phone's
frame or just the battery quality itself
and on that note in a bit of an
unorthodox fashion I'm going to end the
video talking about build quality
because that's the first and the last
thing that you'll remember about the g6
when you first pick it up and when you
set it down to walk away in this arena
it is top notch and I don't say that
lightly
compared to my s7 it's a bit edged year
the back of the phone is only slightly
curved so you feel the edges dip into
your palm a bit but I actually don't
mind it it's also not very wide making
it good for one hand use at least in my
case I don't mind the subtle LG logo at
the bottom
I love how bear in the back is and I'm
also a huge fan of the fingerprint
sensor it took a bit of time getting
used to having the home button on the
back of the device especially coming
from something like an s7 where the home
buttons you know where it usually is but
it is a worthwhile adjustment it's just
conveniently placed and unlike the s8
which I've seen a few reviews of I don't
have the phone currently you don't have
to place it next to the camera which I
thought was really weird but why did
Samsung do that so did this is just
convenient it's just like it
on the leap of 5x and the 6p from the
Nexus lineup this is the ideal spot
right here and the sensor is so
sensitive and accurate you'll often find
yourself with an unlocked phone before
you even realized you placed your index
finger there which is a good thing
that's a really good thing the volume
buttons to the left are very tactile yet
light as well feeling less mechanical
and more organic ooh there's a word I
never thought I'd use to describe tech
there it is Salazar studio LG g6 organic
so do I recommend the phone yes but do i
also recommend waiting for the final
verdict on the Samsung Galaxy s8 first
it's the LG G 6 is prime competitor at
this point also yes the LG G 6 will not
disappoint but it's always best to weigh
all options before pulling the trigger
things the LG G 6 is missing by the way
a notification LED and laser autofocus
something that I actually envied from
the previous LG G series but what does
it bring to the table quite a bit more
to compensate you can find a link to the
LG G 6 in this video's description when
it does become available you can
purchase it unlocked or via your
personal carrier if you liked this video
be sure to give it a thumbs up thumbs
down for the opposite click a subscribe
button if you haven't already I will
catch you in the next video
