five of four so here it is folks the
final verdict this is blue sky
now the first thing I want to do is give
huge shout-outs to all the companies
that made blue sky possible and that's
starting of course first off with alpha
cool who supplied almost everything that
you're seeing in the build they supplied
the to three hundred sixty millimeter
radiators it supplied all of the PT G
tubing all sixty feet or so of the PT G
tubing all of the fittings that you see
in here as well as the reservoir and the
pump they also had a ton of stuff sent
over that was necessary for work behind
the scenes that you obviously aren't
seeing in this build but pretty much
anything that you could possibly want
including a variety of graphics card
water block support is offered on aqua
tuning novel websites I have the US
version aqua tuning us and also the
original alpha cool
that's all in German for my German
viewers out there both of the sites are
linked in the description check them out
if you're building any kind of custom
loot PC I do recommend that you start
there they have literally everything
now another prominent feature of this
bill that I cannot go without mentioning
is the lien Lee PCO 11 I don't know if
it's the 11 or just the 11 then the O's
silent anyway it's a beautiful
tempered-glass case I want to give a
personal shout out to Trevor for hooking
me up with this thing I really wanted to
go with a Lambie case for this build
I admire the company I think they make
some of the best looking cases on the
market it's always been my dream to own
a case like this so I'm glad that this
was able to happen I don't think any
other case would have made blue sky look
any better than it already does I also
want to thank v1 tech for supplying
these beautiful back plates the blue
accents of which match the fluid almost
perfectly as well as mod my mods for
supplying this beautiful CPU block here
I was looking for something that was a
bit darker of a blue shade to match the
darker blue in these cables at Tony from
virility supplied and this was it I mean
this was once I saw it he sent a picture
of he's like hey I can see some of these
over tomorrow I was like heck yes this
is the perfect the perfect piece to make
the blue shades of his build come
together I didn't want to be just one
solid shade of blue I think that's a
little boring and when Tony showed the
cables that he had he had those two
different shades in there I knew that
the rest of this build was going to
follow
with that that was just something that I
wanted personally you see tons of just
you know monochromatic builds but I like
a bit of diversity and that's what blue
sky now brings to the table
thermaltake supplied the two gtx 1080
water blocks you look very similar to
the EK water block so i'm glad they
didn't deviate much from this design we
give a personal shout-out to jack over
at thermaltake for overnighting these
blocks making this happen the next day I
send them an email like 2:50 p.m. and
then the next morning those blocks were
literally here so he's shot out from
making that happen it's the reason why
part 4 was as early as it was and that's
why I was able to complete the build
much earlier than I had anticipated
I originally had the parallel bridge
connecting the two cards but that
actually impeded the SLI bridge
connectors to the left and it came very
far over to the left normal to block the
connectors entirely and this will depend
on the kinds of cards you use and you
know how far away the GPU is from those
SLI connectors so it's all about PCB
design in this case it didn't really
work out this is the reference GT X 1080
PCB we're talking about here so what I
had to do was use the two included fluid
connectors one came with each card and
then I cut small just cuts of ptg tubing
and put those in between the fluid
connectors to you know obviously
complete the loop now you're probably
wondering why I have the Trident II RGB
Ram set to an RGB setting I originally
intended to have those dims oscillating
between like a light blue and a dark
blue but the software support for x99
platforms is not here yet I tried
downloading it and just you know just
see if it would work it does not so I
have to wait for that beta support to
arrive for x99 platforms until then it's
going to be RGB ish but that it will be
blue I guarantee you it will be blue
once that software support arrives but
just a general comment on the dims
themselves the RGB functionality is
superb you can literally replicate any
color you want
neon green no problem yellow no problem
pink no problem and I've seen the
software being run on other platforms
that are supported at this point and you
have total customizability so these
these DIMMs aren't the cheapest
admittedly they're going to cost you
over a hundred bucks for a 16 gig kit
but they're going to they're going to
look super sexy in that
ring of yours now something I wanted to
mention in regards part 2a for of the
project blue sky series is how I was
with all of you about the PT g2 bending
process I caught a lot of flack for
being unprepared and not doing my
homework people even accuse me of not
watching YouTube instructions before
going about the process which in and of
itself is a ridiculous claim what I did
do was show you the learning curve that
was the the learning process and there
is a curve there it's not something you
can just pick up and do it takes time it
takes practice it is an art and I think
any of the the professionals I guess you
could call them who have been doing this
for a long time would admit the same
thing but I even emphasize at the end of
that video that once you get through the
first couple of hurdles you know the
first day or so is going to be rough if
it's your first time once used to how
far away to hold the PT G tubing from
the heat gun how much of the tube to
heat up when you're going about bending
the tubing then you're going to you're
going to be smooth sailing and at this
point I can pretty much make any ptg
Bend that I want the first time around
without screwing up and have that be
good to go so if you don't appreciate
the honesty the upfront kind of like a
learning curve discussion in my videos
this isn't the channel for you it's just
something that I will always do because
I'm not going to act like I'm an expert
in something that I haven't done before
and I'm not going to try to learn it and
rush through the process and then create
an instructional video because there are
plenty of those out there from people
who have already done it many times so
I'd rather set myself apart in another
way and just be honest about the process
altogether I will say it pays off so
just keep practicing if this is your
first time doing something like this
keep doing it you know just come up with
some hypothetical bends try doing some
crazy stuff and if you can do all of
that then you can pull off the vent
necessary to build a computer much like
project blue sky so I say they surprise
announcement for last and that is that I
will be undergoing a new custom blue PC
build changing one variable mainly that
is I will not be using PT G this time
around but glass doing so will be using
a bunch of fittings will have primo
chill predominantly on board with this
one and then we'll have maybe some other
components like graphics card blocks
from other vendors will be using a
defined s from fractal design plenty of
water cooling potential in a mid tower
sized form factor a motherboard I
believe from gigabyte to rx for 80s and
1,700 X because risin is the hot topics
stay tuned for that actually have a few
rough draft already up but you guys know
that that is subject to change
definitely the end result with project
blue sky looked nothing like how I
planned it envisioned it in my head but
I did just you know jump into this whole
thing right away I didn't start with
soft tubing or anything I like to go all
out and that's why there was such a big
learning curve for me but at this point
it very comfortable and the glass is up
next with that I hope you've enjoyed the
project blue sky series this video here
marks the finale the finished product I
know there are some things that a few of
you are going to like you might not like
the coolant you might not like the RGB
ran the way they are
there's always something that someone's
going to complain about but this is my
build and I love it exactly the way it
is and that's all that matters if you
liked this video be sure to give it a
thumbs up thumbs down for the opposite
click a subscribe button if you haven't
already I will catch you in the next
video this is Salazar studio thanks for
building with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
