video a more behind-the-scenes tour
again I'm gonna talk about company
relationships I noticed that whenever we
have reviews on the channel that are
pretty much positive because the product
is a really good product there are
always a few people in the comment
sections who say oh well obviously this
video was you know positive because
they're sending the product for free
especially if it's an expensive item
that's when people raise their eyebrows
and I don't blame them for initially
thinking this but I want to clear the
air here and I'm sure other tech tubers
can you can agree with at least some of
the stuff I'm going to talk about here
I'm gonna be very blunt with you about
how I approach this on the channel and
how I approach company relationships how
all those things culminate into a review
that I present to all of you and
ultimately present to the company
because a review is more or less an
indication of how the consumer might see
the product and it can be a chance for
the company to revise the product in the
future make more sales right and that's
all good everyone wants to make money
and be happy right so that's what I'm
gonna talk about it's something I
noticed many other tech tubers haven't
specifically touched on yet and I want
to hear especially what you guys think
below in the comments section so listen
what I say here and let me know what you
think I don't expect you'll agree with
everything I say
but I want to make sure that there is
full transparency when it comes to
reviews on this channel especially when
they involve products that we receive
and get to keep for free so I'm gonna
keep things short and sweet I don't
expect this video will be very long
we'll see if I can do this all in one or
two takes but we're gonna go back to the
very beginning of when we started
working with specifically PC related
tech companies in this space on science
studio the first company we ever worked
with who was willing to send us a
product for free of substantial value
not like a battery pack or something
like that
was deep cool that happened around 50 or
60 thousand subscribers and this was
mind you before the massive influx of
tech tubers into the YouTube space so
tech tubers now receiving products for
free from companies it seems like when
they have like 5 or 10k subs and it's
because they have more outlets now right
to choose from but back when we had
around 50 or 60 K there weren't nearly
as many so I feel like the criteria for
receiving products was a bit higher back
then because there are so many people
doing it now it's probably a bit lower
that that's how I see it objectively so
I think that when we started working
with
cool we had about 50 K and the first
product they sent to us was a deep
cooled genome case and that was a case
with 80 virus looking reservoir up front
a built in a io actually a pretty unique
case rota was deep cool always has
unique cases and that's one of the
reasons why I like the company so much
you guys I'm sure if at least heard of
the company if you watch this channel on
at least a weekly basis so that was the
first company we worked with we're still
on good terms with them today and I've
given some of their products some iffy
reviews in terms of thing the positives
and negatives right not all reviews that
I upload are primarily positive some
reviews are primarily negative and some
companies take that to heart and decide
not to send us products anymore BitFenix
did that for sure with their Shogun case
NZXT hasn't sent us an email about a
case since the H 700 I and that's
probably because they didn't like our
opinions about the case aesthetically
like the cables shroud the management
board whatever you want to call it you
know this is just how I see things but
they didn't send us a case after that
they haven't sent us H 400 i h 200 i i
had asked for that case to build in and
then they didn't send us an h 500 so i
don't know maybe they're just being very
picky about who they send review samples
to but in my opinion send it to as many
reputable youtubers as you can right
that we get a culmination of opinions
and you can refine your product better
in the future because not all viewers
watch one or two channels so I don't
know that's how I see it but those
companies have the right all companies
have the right to be picky about who
they send products to and that's one of
the downsides of being very objective
and very critical I'm sure there text
you Bruce can attest to this as well
when you publish a review that you know
a company's not gonna like or you send
an email to a company saying hey this
isn't working this isn't working you
know what's going on here
those companies usually you know it's
it's tough from a PR perspective to
handle those criticisms especially on
channels that have millions of
subscribers but I still think we have a
reputation to uphold when it comes to
being objective and companies know that
so when they send us products they're
taking on a bit of risk right because if
we don't like the product then our
viewer base at least the viewers who
watch that video are either going to
agree with us or see from our point
right our
perspective or they're gonna openly
disagree with it usually people who
watch this channel on other channels
either do it because they like
disagreeing opinions which is weird or
they do it because they see their
opinions falling in line with the
reviewers opinions so yeah that's how I
see that and it's a consequence of being
objective but companies will drop you if
you don't if you don't give them a
positive review and that's something
that people use in comments sections
when they cease solely positive reviews
on our channels they say well obviously
if you gave him a negative review they
wouldn't send your products anymore and
to an extent that's that's correct yeah
but we should not be afraid to lose
those relationships if we want to be
objective and want to publish a review
that has maybe more negatives than
positives let's say about a case
sticking with our analogy if a company
decides that they don't want to talk to
us any longer after one single negative
review a review that emphasizes more
negatives let's say than positives maybe
because the product isn't that great to
begin with then I don't want to work
with that company if that company is
gonna be that fickle about their
relationship they have with us and
they're gonna base it solely on whether
or not we give positive feedback to said
company and to our viewers then to me
that's just the that's the shallowest of
shallow corporate relationships you can
have and I'm I'm happy that they that
they do that I mean it lets me know who
they are how they operate and it's not
something I want to deal with in the
long run
so yeah that's obviously an inherent
downside of being objective but I think
in the long run that's what your viewers
will appreciate more and that's what
will drive your channel into the future
is people will see that you're not
afraid to be objective that you're not
afraid to tell it like it is if it's an
opinion so be it you have an opinion
state your opinion that's why people
walk you because they want to know what
you think about product just say it if
the company says well we'll work this
out next time you know maybe we can
throw some revisions in here send us an
email give us some feedback directly
that we can maybe implement to the next
version of this case or what have you
that's a super cool company company I
love companies that are like that
because they're open minded and they're
not gonna produce a product that
everyone's gonna love they are always
going to be people who disagree with you
so companies that take all that feedback
to heart and just work with you on a
personal basis and that's awesome
even aesthetically you know if a company
puts something out there that is very
edgy right and a certain reviewer just
doesn't buy it just doesn't think it
looks that great then in my opinion the
company should just be like okay well
maybe we'll produce something else here
soon or we'll tweak it a little bit to
make it less edgy and more conservative
let's say and maybe the reviewer will
like it then maybe the company reaches
out directly and says hey what do you
want to see in this other revision of
this case that's what we want you know
like I'm a smaller I'm sure most of them
probably go to me for advice for that
stuff we just don't have as big a
following but companies that do that in
general are the ones that I want to work
with the other qualities select viewers
tend to have when it comes to positive
reviews is that they think we somehow
have access to a huge seller base and
then we can sell all of these products
we get for free and very quickly for a
lot of cash and let me say up front
there is no contract stating that we
can't sell products we receive for free
now there are stipulations sometimes
like if we get a review sample I love
them not review simple an engineering
sample of an Intel CPU those are
technically not for reason you're not
supposed to resell those you know it's
more or less the terms of service type
thing but there's no contract there so
legally we can do what every one of
these products but I choose personally
to not sell any product that I receive
for free because I find it distasteful
any product I ever sell will be
something that I have paid for
personally out of my own pocket with the
own money I've earned and that that I
think is how a lot of tech tubers
approach this it's just it's just Shady
at best to sell stuff that a company is
sending you for free and if the company
finds out that you're selling their
stuff for free on the market then I'm
pretty sure they're not gonna be very
happy with you either so ultimately
there is no financial gain for receiving
a product for free what it ends up doing
basically is taking up inventory taking
up shelf space and I've actually had to
use a whole quarter of my garage now for
PC cases and just open boxes things that
don't need immediately because I don't
have any room in here I have a whole
bedroom I don't even use for anything
right now and it's just it's just for
storage right now and that is something
that you'll notice as you
Roah is a tech tuber you're gonna have
that inventory that piles up maybe you
do giveaways to get rid of some of that
inventory that's always cool I give away
a lot of my products that aren't you
know too expensive that make no sense
from a giveaway standpoint because
you're gonna pay more for shipping
internationally than you actually would
for the product itself
I give that stuff usually with my family
to my friends people who live locally I
was like I've done things where we've
had like yard sales where I've had tons
of items and I've just said okay
everything that I have here I'm gonna
sell for 20 bucks apiece whether it
being a motherboard keyboard
what-have-you only to prevent a single
person from showing up and taking
everything I've done that before and
I've recycled all that money back into
the channel I make sure to keep that
separate from my personal expenses but
that's about the extent of it that's all
I've really ever done and that only
happened one time when I moved from my
apartment in Louisiana when I graduated
college to Florida where we are now it's
really hot here so that really about
sums it up here like we do not sell
products we receive for free we don't
get paid for reviews I'm speaking for
our channel specifically here and we
don't really care about maintaining
corporate relationships if said
companies are going to be fickle like I
said and decide that they don't want to
send us any more products because of one
negative review like the way I see it if
you don't want to send similar products
thanks for letting me know you're like
that because I don't want to work with
you in the future that that's my train
of thought that's how I approach it you
guys might not agree with it but that's
just how I handle business here and I
think that it does benefit you in the
long run because if a company is like
that openly even if it's just a 1 or 2
tech tubers to me it's just it says a
lot about the character of the company
and the goals of the company and and
that's why I'm just naming names I'm not
afraid to keep this stuff on the DL this
should be public because it's public for
all of you the stuff that I review if
you're wondering why you don't see a
product reviewed when everyone else is
reviewing it maybe it's because the
company didn't say to send us a sample
at which point you should ask why didn't
they send this tech tuber or sample and
so yeah I'm just gonna go ahead and say
it so I want to know you guys think in
the comments section below
this is just a topic that again not many
people talk about in the tech tuber
space but it's something that I feel
like should be addressed because it does
pertain to all of you pertains not just
to us be
were the ones reviewing but it pertains
to you because you're the viewer should
you trust us if we receive a product for
free
I'm telling you yes because we don't
sell the products if we do anything we
give them away not and we're generally
not afraid of losing a company contact
over something that just meaningless in
the long run if they don't like the
review in question and usually there are
other companies that will be willing to
work with us if that company falls
through there are plenty of case
manufacturers plenty of PSU
manufacturers monitor manufacturers
chair manufacturers you guys know the
competition is real and that's another
reason why I want to tell you that you
can trust us because if one company
drops us look I'll be more than happy to
say that they openly drop this and then
move on to other companies that are
willing to help us you know inventory
wise and who are just more open about
feedback whether it be positive or
negative you want to see companies like
that and I work with a ton of them if
you see products being reviewed over and
over on this channel from a particular
company that's because that company
whether we give negative reviews or
positive reviews appreciates our
feedback and I love that so we're going
to encourage you guys to leave comments
down below
I don't expect all of you to agree
word-for-word with us or see eye to eye
on these topics this is just us being
transparent and as blunt as possible
with how we approach reviews you will
never see money ever mixed in with a
review from the same company ever and
you you won't even see pre rules right
from the same company in a video we're
reviewing a company's product like that
to me the conflict of interest of course
are as a headset we're promoting and
pre-rolls and then we have to review a
Corsair case I'm not gonna put that
pre-roll into the case review to me
that's a that's a conflict of interest
you're not gonna see stuff like that on
this channel in particular other tech
tubers Tim to be on the fence about it
but here you're not gonna see anything
like that because I do think that it is
slightly misleading and it does convey a
sense of you know distrust right if you
see a company's paying you even if it's
are a different product you want to keep
that company paying you're right so why
not give good reviews especially when
you're promoting the product in the same
yeah there's a lot of gray area gray
space but I'm here to tell you no matter
what we will never sacrifice our own
integrity for the sake of keeping a
company happy to me that is just a
ridiculous idea and that would ruin the
relationship that we have with all of
you
so again thumbs up if you liked the
video dislike it if you feel like doing
that or if you hate everything about
life click that red subscribe button if
you haven't read any stay tuned for more
