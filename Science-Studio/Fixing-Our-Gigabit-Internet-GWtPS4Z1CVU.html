problem we have gigabit here which means
we're getting effectively a thousand
megabits down and we also get I believe
a thousand megabits up of course that's
theoretical limits we actually get in
in actuality somewhere around five to
six hundred megabits per second which is
still really good I mean that's gonna
push you around just divide that by
eight that's your megabyte download so
if you're downloading a game from Steam
you're still gonna hit 60 70 megabytes
per second which is really good you can
download a you know 50 gigabyte game in
minutes practically but the issue with
this apartment this is not a place that
we owned we were just renting here is
that we only have one active rj45 port
right built into the wall which means we
have my my modem is in the office and
that modem is in and of itself not a
great Wi-Fi router you know the built-in
modem router deals are usually pretty
bad so I have a Google home Wi-Fi kit
we're gonna use not the best for this
scenario but we're gonna switch to that
anyways I think it's still gonna be
better than what we are currently
running now this is going to come in
handy because this right here is a 12
port patch panel so we have fiber and
what that means is a single little cable
I'll show you in a second runs into a
box and then from there you have a
single cat 5e cable should be cat 6 but
it's cat 5e in this case runs into a
small single port patch panel and then
from there it basically makes one of
these internet ports hot just one and
it's in the office so all these are the
Ethernet ports built into the walls
don't work at all so we're gonna patch
the rest of those cat5e cables in there
to this patch panel and then we're gonna
move the router excuse me the modem into
the panel as well where the fiber runs
into the apartment and then we're gonna
light up all of these rj45 ports and
hopefully give ourselves some decent
Wi-Fi as well as you know wired
connections throughout the apartment so
we're gonna go into that closet right
now for some reason they put the the
fiber termination in the closet I don't
understand
did that alright so this is where the
fiber terminates in the apartment I
doesn't look like much did you see this
you know cat5e cables running everywhere
this is our single patch panel of sorts
so what that means is instead of having
to you know cut all these wires down
exposing the copper and then wiring
those directly to a panel like this all
you have to do is run the the insulated
wire into the patch panel and then press
a little lever down and that effectively
creates or completes the circuit between
all these wires and the rj45 port now we
have the this is the fiber line this
single yellow wire right here that is
where the fiber comes from and this box
just a bunch of magic goes on in here
I'm not going to attempt to explain what
happens anyway out the other side you
get a cat5e should be cat 6 cable into
the patch board and this right here is
the cat 5e cable that runs into my
office you can see it's the only one
that's hot and then these other
cat5e cables really do nothing so we're
gonna strip all of these down and we're
gonna take our 12 port patch panel which
is overkill but whatever and we're gonna
hook up all of these to the patch panel
and then we're gonna pull the modem in
here and light all of them up instead of
just this single one alright so we need
to find a way to fit this modem and our
12 port patch panel in this little
cutout in the wall and you can see we
have our four ports here and in the
modem we could use a switch if we needed
more ports but the the issue is right we
don't want to have to wire four of these
connections on to the ends of these
cat5e cables and that's really what we
need to do to get these hot so the patch
panel eliminates the need for that this
is definitely overkill we don't have 12
ports but it's got a future-proof it's
nice to have something this hardcore
and I guess we'll just kind of place it
on top and then I have for cat6 cables
just for the sake of future proofing
that will run from here to the modem and
that will heat up all of these okay so
what you're looking at here was the
original port in the office it's now
connected to the patch panel I'll show
you how I did this in a second I just
want to show you how it were
and kind of in principle so in between
each of these little grooves are pieces
of metal and the further you push down
these wires they kind of cut into the
insulation of each wire and then of
course complete that circuit and we went
ahead and tested this one so you can see
we have the cat6 cable running into the
modem and we're getting almost the exact
same uploads and downloads wired that we
were originally with the modem in the
office so that's good that means the
connections are all in check and we're
gonna keep doing this for the other
three cat5 cables and then we will test
those and then try to clean this up
because wow this is if I can get the
focus - so there we go yeah this is
pretty messy right now now I don't have
the patch tool which means I am doing
this in a very suggestive way I do not
suggest you guys do it this way by the
tool for 20 bucks or so if you were
gonna do this more than once this part
the only time I'm gonna do it at least
in this apartment so I'll use a very
thin flathead screwdriver and just jam
these cables all the way down so I'll
show you what I'm doing so this is the
brown solid wire and I'm gonna push this
as far down into the tool as I can and
then I'll kind of do is for each cable
first and then I'll come through again
and I'll push it all the way down next
step you can see is orange and we have
the little key here which is really nice
so solid orange on top okay all right
and now here's the sketchy part the part
that I do not recommend you copy going
to take my flat head screwdriver you
want as thin as possible because the the
gaps through these channels are very
thin you don't want a big one because
you'll end up spreading the channel
distance and then you might not get
proper contact this still isn't again
good but it's better than nothing I'll
push it all the way down you'll hear it
click a few times and I know it's kind
of hard to get up close but you can see
that cable that brown one is all the way
down now inside so we can assume that
that is making proper contact do it
again for the rest of these wires
straight in without breaking anything so
we'll definitely want to check these
connections problem is I don't know
where this cable goes so we'll have to
kind of poke around the remaining
Ethernet ports in the
in the apartment and see which one of
these is hot so let's go do that real
quick okay just take a hundred-foot cat
5e cable and we connected it to one
random port back there actually the one
behind the living room TV and we're
gonna see if we get any wired connection
here on Lisa's PC we have a one in three
shot so would be pretty darn lucky if we
figured that out okay so it's not that
one so now we need to figure out where
it actually goes all right so this is
the other port this is the one in our
bedroom which we don't really need but
just out of curiosity sleep we'll see if
that one's hot not connected so by
process of elimination it must be in
writing in the net port which I don't
know I don't know where it is
and just for reference each of these
speed tests would be different you know
we're using ATT speed test here you
could use Xfinity zyou could use speed
test net it doesn't really matter
they're all gonna give you different
results they're all tied to different
servers but I just want to test
consistency here downloads were 746
megabits per second it's about 75% of
our cap is pretty good uploads are even
higher
almost 900 megabits per second which is
good for Lisa because if this is her
streaming PC they come back and come
back and come back how do you feel about
having a gigabit connection okay so this
one right here this is the connection
that you just saw for Lisa's PC as far
as I'm aware we only have three Ethernet
ports in the apartment so kind of
concern where that fourth one's going it
could be this blank patch right here I'd
have to unscrew that and check but
anyway we're gonna patch the fourth one
up that should be the one in the bedroom
we're not actually gonna use the one in
the bedroom but for good measure we'll
do it anyway just so you know if we put
a TV in there or something with with an
Ethernet board on it we can hook that up
to it have superfast internet this isn't
going to be a clean cut it's not gonna
steal the cable like a patch to a wood
but it's at least gonna get rid of the
phrase so I just take wire cutters I get
as close to this as I can and I just cut
them down so that's good-looking enough
and see we ran all of our cables on the
inside here it keeps things clean and
then we can put our cover back on just
press it down okay cool so there it is
all right and all this excess cat5 cable
we can just tuck into the wall someone's
gonna see it up there plenty of space
between the studs roll up these are coax
lines these black ones don't need these
either so we can actually push these up
there I'll leave a bit of it exposed in
case anyone in the future needs it all
right so we got a patch panel kind of
squished here between the magic box and
the frame of this little box and
remember the second port we don't know
where that goes we only have three at
the net ports in the
apartment so that's why that one's a
blank and I'm gonna plug the fourth cat6
cable or the third one rather in this
case into the fourth port so now we've
got three of these I'm gonna run these
into the back of the modem and the modem
will fit nicely right here so I'm gonna
try my best to make it look pretty I
doubt anyone other than you guys online
are gonna see this and I doubt any one
person will see this so it's not really
that big a deal this is like a mini ITX
PC build so I reminds me of and we have
this plastic shield it's nice they use
plastic a 18t was telling me that they
used to use metal ones and that really
made no sense cuz you're you put your
modem in here and it's acting as your
router you're kind of sealing off a lot
of that potential connection so let's
hope this fits all right and there we go
good as new all right and this last
piece here is the router now I am
treating this as a router currently and
I have the Netgear router that actually
the AT&amp;amp;T modem which also has a built in
router in pass-through mode or as close
to passing mode as it possibly can so
it's still nodding and all that stuff
which means we have double netting going
on here because this is its own router
as well so its own protocols to take
care of and that's gonna slow things up
just a bit in an ideal situation this
could be either an extender or I could
put the modem in full pass-through mode
but the problem is we have all of our
cables for the ethernet ports in the
apartment running through the modem so
we can't just disable the modem which is
kind of a shame so well maybe at some
point figure out how to bypass that I
know some people figure out how to do it
with AT&amp;amp;T but for now I'm okay with this
I went ahead and tested Wi-Fi throughout
the apartment still getting around 2 to
300 megabits per second on a phone and
phone Wi-Fi antennas aren't as good as a
lot laptops usually so laptops should
score even higher than that but this is
good enough you know I'm not looking for
a serious like commercial grade solution
I just wanted something that was not the
the 18 t modem because it just was
really spotty sometimes connection would
totally drop and it would confuse the
phones other devices hooked up to the
Wi-Fi so this seems to be a lot more
stable tested on
TV my cell phone my laptop and I'm
satisfied right now with the results all
right so that was a fun project I have
not done anything like that before the
closest ever gotten to like hardcore
networking is uh setting up a router and
a modem that's yet so it was nice to
kind of work with a patch board for once
I actually bought that one from Home
Depot so I didn't have to order on lines
kind of commercial-grade stuff like you
expect like contractors and stuff to
work with that when they're setting up
the internet capabilities of your new
home or new apartment I was really good
I didn't have to use something like this
this would have sucked because there's
eight of those small wires inside each
cat 5e cable and then having to strip
each of those on both ends wire them
together add another soldering or you
know wrap them with electrical tape
whatever it would have been kind of
sketch but that patch board came in real
handy so in the future wherever I go
wherever we move I'll take that with me
and we can have a much easier time
setting things up on the network side I
know I'm kind of a new but this still
I'm not acting like I'm a you know full
fledged pro at this stuff I do want to
thank will for helping me out because
will is a pro in this space and maybe
the future will be more videos like this
for you you know you and I are both kind
of learning at the same time assuming
you don't know much about the networking
stuff which is definitely my case you
guys like the video thumbs up know what
to do thumbs down for the opposite if
you hear it alright like click the red
subscribe if you haven't and I'll catch
you in the next video this is science
studio thanks for watching and thanks
for learning with
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
