in regards to inflated graphics card
prices why not just regulate them as in
why doesn't the government step in and
set a maximum price for said graphics
cards to prevent those greedy companies
from reaping all the money they can in
economics this is called a price ceiling
studying this a bit of my MBA finance
classes this quarter so I thought a
video would be a cool review guide of
sorts totally selfish here and to answer
this question I will need my trusty
whiteboard welcome to crash course now I
was supposed to say that sorry for the
awkward pause there so I'll be speaking
with respect to the United States here a
majority of my viewers do live here and
I am most familiar with our own laws and
economic policies I certainly don't want
to speak out of place but things might
be different where you live so just keep
that in mind in the US though a price
ceiling is a government mandated maximum
price for a specific good now if you
recall from elementary economics our
linear supply and demand curves
equilibrium price exists at the
intersection of the two trends they're
actually curved somewhat like this so
this is where both consumers and
producers are stable and comfortable in
their buying and selling habits there is
no incentive from sellers to raise
prices and there is no incentive from
buyers to seek alternatives now in the
case of the graphics card market we have
no such price ceiling regulation
suppliers and AIB manufacturers offer
suggested retail prices to their vendors
if they're not the vendors themselves
who in turn adjust prices according to
fluctuations in these two curves so in
short no one is being forced to keep
prices below a certain value which is
what a price ceiling would otherwise do
today's GPU market looks something like
this with the demand curve shifted to
the right signifying an increase in
demand for all graphics cards at all
prices thanks largely to mining and with
the supply curve shifted to the left
which is typically a response to an
increase in price or quantity demanded
for the purpose of preserving inventory
now if at any point demand for a certain
card increases unexpectedly then a
temporary market shortage will exist no
this is just a slide along the demand
curve
is not another shift in the entire curve
itself the shortage is identified by
this gap in the two curves until supply
is restocked keep in mind our x-axis
here is quantity so since we've deviated
from market equilibrium what we'll be
left with is something like this and
this is essentially what would happen if
a binding price ceiling was instated we
see it in retail stores all the time
consider the Fry's Electronics I visited
in Vegas
shortly after CES you can watch a full
video right here but in a section of it
we highlighted the graphics card stock
which was completely cleaned out at
least for anything above like rx 460 and
1050 Ti caliber this is what happens
when retail stores set artificial price
ceilings in microeconomics if we
consider a retail store supply and
demand curves for certain good we'll
still have a market equilibrium a
binding price ceiling then would look
something like this a dotted horizontal
line below the intersection the result
is excess demand indicated by the length
of this line between the supply and
demand curves so the lower the price
ceiling is below the market equilibrium
the greater the disparity between
quantity supplied and quantity demanded
I tried looking for examples of price
ceilings online and I kept finding the
same one rent control apparently this is
more of a common thing today in Europe
the US was engaged in this to an extent
after World War Two but in a nutshell
rent control is typically a mandated
price ceiling for apartments on the
market ergo landlords and owners can't
charge more than a certain price per
unit area of apartment space in a given
location some ceilings are sloppy though
and are blanket price fixes across
multiple locations of buildings so it
doesn't matter in in those cases whether
you have a really big apartment or a
small one or if it's close to the center
of town or not they'll all be the same
blanket price right that's the cat the
highest you can charge and that's a much
bigger problem but even for the ones
that consider other economic factors
there are very apparent downsides
firstly supply shortages and while these
happen on and off in capital markets all
the time like we have goods that go out
of stock for a while right that's normal
they aren't typically prolonged or
permanent like those created from price
ceilings this is where the downward
spiral begins once consumers catch on
with lack of supply they'll likely seek
alternatives this is where they use
graphics card market and arcade
comes into play or competitors like
AMD's Raven Ridge APU lineup if enough
of the supply is dried up a few
companies may exit the market or
reallocate resources but if enough of
the suppliers go out of business then
the price ceiling fails since the new
level of supply falls below the price
ceiling mandates so it really is doing
nothing it's non-binding if the ceiling
is then abolished the prices will
skyrocket right and new suppliers will
enter the market to take advantage of
the potential profits and if enough
manipulation takes place another price
ceiling will be instated
and the cycle continues companies may
also resort to mischievous tactics in an
effort to work around the price ceiling
mandate we've seen this time and time
again not just with price ceilings for
example graphics card suppliers could
collude with each other and sell to u.s.
citizens and European markets through
foreign distributors apart from import
taxes foreign goods aren't subject to
domestic price ceilings so they could
cut off the u.s. supplies and then force
everyone to to the European markets
right to channel through them because
there they can raise prices to whatever
they see fit so in short a price ceiling
is just a short term remedy consumers
see these as mere windows of opportunity
to buy up as much of the supply as
possible while it lasts which is why
many retailers and post purchase limits
for things like graphics cards in an
effort to preserve supply as much as
they can
what most don't expect however is the
inevitable shortage they will soon
experience as a result of the binding
price ceiling which is why retail stores
in particular seem to always be out of
stock especially if they're trying to
keep prices down for the general
consumer so to answer this question I
don't think graphics card regulation is
a good one in this current market to
pursue as stated in the video I pointed
to earlier one of the only instances in
which I'd recommend government
intervention at this level is in the
case of corporate collusion when cartels
or oligopolies begin to take advantage
of the little man right they collude to
elevate prices without an economic
incentive apart from profit and they
should be regulated period it's why
Commission's like the FTC in the United
States exist they're there to preserve
the perfect competition model or as
close to perfect as possible of course
nothing that we make or try to maintain
is ever really perfect better to have
some stock though at higher prices than
no stock
all that's at least how I see it you may
disagree let me know if you do in the
comments below if you like this video we
should let me know give someone a thumbs
up I appreciate it thumbs down for the
obstacle subscribe but if you have it
already in stay tuned for more content
