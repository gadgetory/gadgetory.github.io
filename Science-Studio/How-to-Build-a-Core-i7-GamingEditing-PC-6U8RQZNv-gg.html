the delay I didn't have my editing rig
for quite a while and I didn't feel like
editing on this Lenovo 100's if you're
interested in how that experience was
you can check out the card above me what
I have done is built an entirely new
editing rig from the ground up and it's
featuring the core i7 6700 K I do have
benchmarks ready to go but I'm not going
to put them in this video because this
video is dedicated to building the PC so
I know that most of you who are
subscribed to the channel already know
how to do this but it never hurts to you
know get a nice refresher in there and
on top of that you get to see the rig
being assembled from the ground up
that's kind of nice as well so let's go
ahead and jump into the building process
without further ado got your pens and
notepads ready alright here we go here's
a basic parts rundown you'll need a z170
motherboard ours is the Asus z170a ATX
board and Intel Core i7 6700 K 16
gigabytes of 3,000 megahertz ddr4 in
this case Geils super loose with white
LEDs and all-in-one CPU cooler a
reliable power supply from a reliable
brand preferably 600 watts or above a
one terabyte Western Digital black hard
disk drive for general storage a P&amp;amp;Y 120
gigabyte solid state drive for a snappy
OS arctic silver 5 thermal compound a
dedicated graphics card I've gone with
an r9 390 for the time being but more on
that later and a corsair carbide
400-seat you can check out my review of
this case in the card right here it's
game time
start with your motherboard this Asus
z170a is a great choice for a variety of
reasons it has a chipset which supports
overclocking plenty of voltage regulator
modules a dedicated sound driver for 5.1
channel audio native sli and crossfire
support an excellent color scheme
although I did paint these heatsinks
white from their previous gray click the
card right here to check out my painting
tutorial and finally plenty of rear i/o
ports including 5.1 audio USB 3.1 and
type-c connectors DVI VGA HDMI and
DisplayPort support and 2 USB 3.0
headers accompanied by 2
USB 2.0 counterparts go ahead and grab
your processor we'll be using a core i7
6700k a top-of-the-line LGA 1151 CPU
it's clock the 4 gigahertz
out-of-the-box and should overclock
quite nicely the 6700 k-pax 8 megabytes
of l3 cache a stock frequency of 4
gigahertz which turbo boost up to 4.2 14
nanometers skyleigh transistor
architecture and 4 cores with
hyper-threading for a total of 8 threads
with your CPU ready pull up the lever to
the right of the socket on the
motherboard until the door is standing
safely upright identify the Golden
Triangle on the CPU itself and orient
the chip so that it's triangle points in
the same direction as the triangle
located on the board being extra careful
rest the CPU in the socket arrest it do
not force it it will only slide in one
way simply set the chip down atop the
various pins within the socket and then
lower the retention arm once again
ensuring that the socket hinge itself
secures under this screw the arm will
require additional force to latch once
again this is completely normal no
worries the socket cover should pop
right off at this point store this
somewhere safe in case you ever need to
return your motherboard next it's time
to install Ram this step is very simple
but it does require a bit of unorthodox
force once again go ahead and pull out
both dims and take note of the notch at
the bottoms of both these will need to
be aligned with the notches in RAM slots
2 and 4 on the motherboard
with the notches aligned and the slot
levers 2 and 4 pull back push each dim
in to its rightful place additional
force is required to suggest starting
from one side securing it and then
securing the other side subsequently
we're replacing these in slots 2 &amp;amp; 4
specifically for dual channel support
not bad so far you've installed your CPU
and RAM into this beautiful motherboard
now we'll need our NZXT kraken X 61 this
is a 280 millimeter radiator and comes
with two 140 millimeter pulse width
modulated fans we want our air in our
case flowing through our radiator so
we'll orient our fans in such a way that
air is pulled through the rad and into
our case and subsequently exhaust
without the back
you may also orient these fans in the
opposite direction as I've done in the
past to exhaust air out the front of the
rad but this method is not condoned by
NZXT we'll follow the rules here grab a
hold of 8 included washers and long
screws and secure the fans to the
radiator
make sure each of these is turned nice
and tight loose fans will be loud and
could break much sooner now it's time to
start assembling all the little parts
and pieces into our 400 C or whatever
case you might have chosen start by
removing the bottom basement from the
400 C these three screws in the back
hold these into place grab another set
of eight washers and eight low-profile
screws from the x61 bag and mount the
radiator to the front of the case ensure
each of these screws is completely
secure force
now grab your power supply in my case
I've gone with you ready for this an
Eevee today 750 watt B to 80 plus bronze
supernova power supply it with modular
capabilities secure the unit to the back
of your case with the included screws
grab the i/o shield that came with the
motherboard and snap it into place from
all four corners in the i/o slot at the
back of your case locate the standoffs
screw near the middle of the case and
gently lower your motherboard into place
using the standoff and the rear i/o as
reference points all screw holes should
align with the standoffs built into the
400 C now grab a hold of the small parts
box included with the case it should be
in the hard drive bay and then use the
motherboard screws the screws that look
like they have washers built into them
to secure the motherboard to the chassis
in the center stand off I pointed to
earlier won't require a screw
take the rear bracket from the x61 kit
and slide each of the placeholders
toward its center most position then
slide it through the holes at the back
of the motherboard take the standoffs
screws that have equal threading lengths
on both sides and screw one end into
each of the four bracket leads at this
point the bracket should be secured to
the motherboard
read the front bracket which I've
painted white through the water block of
the cooler and secure it with the small
black ring included with the kid as well
if this part is confusing you can check
out my in-depth guide here once the
cooler is prepped we've got one last
thing to do before officially mounting
it thermal paste I use Arctic silver 5
but any five to six dollar pastes should
be fine
apply a modest amount over the CFU heat
spreader and then secure the water block
to the cpu by aligning to the four
threads from the standoffs with the
inside holes of the front bracket turn
with your fingers until the screws build
up a significant amount of resistance at
all four corners next remove the hard
drive cage so that we have plenty of
access to modular ports on the power
supply with these installed and funneled
through the back of the case we'll need
to mount our storage devices remove a
three and a half inch drive bay from the
cage that we just took out and secure
the hard drive by aligning the holes in
the drive with the pins of the bay a
nice tooless feature this is now
reinsert the cage with the hard drive
and secure it from the back with the
included screws grab your SSD I strongly
recommend you have one of these with
this caliber build and simply secure it
to the back of the Corsair 400 C by
sliding it into one of the three SSD
trays integrated with the case another
toolless feature here go and connect it
to SATA power as well remove the dust
filter at the top of the case and add
any extra fans you have laying around
I've got an extra two fan text 140
millimeter fans I'll be throwing into my
rig oriented downwards to the air is
pulling into the case from the top this
in tandem with the fan intakes on the
radiator should create a nice chamber of
positive airflow within the 400 C if you
prefer negative air pressure
environments these can be turned around
and set to exhaust instead if you've got
a fan hub secure this to the case as
well this one from fantex uses a velcro
adhesive to keep the hub in place you'll
want to connect the four pin lead from
this hub to a four pin header on your
motherboard preferably a header labeled
CH a1 or CH a2
connect your 24-pin power cable from
your power supply to the motherboard as
well as this 8 pin CPU power connector
which you can funnel through the top
left slot in this case and connect the
USB 3.0 header as well kind of cable
managed as you go
using a Seuss's included front i/o
assistant plug positive to positive and
negative to negative of each wire lead
with its corresponding pin on the
assistant with all wires secure plug
this assistant into the bottom right
corner of the motherboard or wherever
yours may be refer to your manual grab a
hold of your graphics card and peel off
its plastic goodness clear 2 PCIe slots
at the back of the case ensure the top
large slot has its lock disengaged and
connect your graphics card after
securing it to the back with the
included screws connect your power
cables in this instance a single 8 pin
and a single 6 pin finally connect SATA
cables from each of your drive devices
to the motherboard ensuring that your
SSDs is inserted into the header labeled
OS Drive now let's see how we did
you
there you have it folks the process is
not all that complicated now no to a
layman someone who's never built a PC
before or who has never messed with the
internals of a PC the process does sound
a bit daunting but I assure you if you
follow this video here and the video in
this card above me the process is not
it's not difficult just take my word for
it if you don't believe me take an old
computer disassemble it put it back
together boom you built a computer and
may not be a computer built from scratch
but you get my point if you're curious
about the performance of this PC be sure
to check out the card above me if it's
not there it's because you're watching
this video the day it was posted and I
appreciate your promptness but otherwise
check it out it's a unique combination
and I 760 700 K paired with an r9 390
which is becoming very very obsolete
very very soon AMD has already told me
they're sending their RX 484 review and
you guys will be seeing that stacked up
head-to-head against this 390 which is
about $100 more than the RX 480 and we
should expect similar performance
between the two cards so we'll see how
Polaris stacks up against the GCM 1.2
architecture I also have a future well
it's already built but I haven't
actually edited the cliffs yet a very
very old PC that I'm going to attempt to
play games on I haven't done that yet
because I think it's going to be a very
difficult process but if you're like
Greg what are you talking about because
you're not following me on Twitter I
invite you to do so follow me at sc/st
Salazar and stay in the loop here in the
studio I have a very old PC coming
literally under a hundred bucks I
actually set 120 in the tweet but that's
because I added a few extra things that
I eventually took away because I really
didn't need them so we're looking at it
under $100 potato PC yes it's at the
table take my word for it be sure to
