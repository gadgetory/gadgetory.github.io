best IPS freesync monitor I don't know
I'm using the TN equivalent of Asus with
a PG 2 9 7 Q some weird model number the
IPS counterpart is a beautiful display
I've seen it
I just didn't buy it because I was too
cheap I just chose TN because I mean who
looks at their monitors from over here
you know a 1050 TR squad nothing wrong
with that nice beard I don't really call
this a beer this is just scruff it's not
all the way there ya know we got a
donation here check that out 10 what
does that New Zealand Dollars just like
that that's cool just about an a6 good
choice it's a v6 I like that economical
what do you say here just want to know
if you still like yours oh yes they like
it so I have it's an S 5 it's a v8 4.2
so that all the FS is for the most part
end in like point twos so three point
two four point two five point two FSI
and it's a strong car no problems
mechanically to date and I hope it stays
that way and of course now that I said
that something's gonna go wrong tomorrow
we'll see how that works
cyber power pcs good yeah they actually
AMD sent a cyber power PC for review I
have one on the channel I should check
that out how much money do you have not
a lot I just got out of college so I
don't have a lot of money hey Greg what
do you do for a living work I do this I
do stuff like this this is actually like
my this is my job my sole income comes
from stuff I do on social media
platforms
let's see ultra wide versus 4k I have a
video actually on that as well not on
the two versus each other but I prefer
ultra wide frankly 4k looks good up
close but from where I usually am
sitting from my monitor the difference
between 4k and 1440p is not substantial
enough to justify the higher price as
well as the usually lower refresh rate
for an equivalently priced monitor so 4k
60 Hertz monitor I wouldn't I would not
for that I would go for the 1440p same
size panel at 140 465 Hertz that's what
I would do
let's see here we go another $5 donation
from the same dude alright cool for me
the Audi I bought from dealer
and they just had to pay six five
hundred to fix the car ouch got water in
them wait you had to pay sixty five
hundred dollars for a headlight swap
dude and then see the problem is because
it's all German it's a pain to fix
anything in any of those cars I just
swapped the exhaust system in mine and
that was a pain to literally we had the
lugs on the like facing the inside of
the engine so we gotta kind of like
maneuver back there and try to get those
things off there's a big pain yeah let's
see so he'll says greg gtx 1060 or Arc's
570 depends I like which is which I
prefer I prefer the software the 1060 I
like Nvidia software although it has
gotten pretty trashy lately I still like
shadowplay I use it a lot so that is
that's what I would go with it's a
little pricier it depends on how much
you want to spend five 70 of those
really solid card I've been chucked a
580 and a 480 and for the price those
are probably the better bang for the
buck just from raw performance
standpoints let's see hey Greg
hold on saw that donation never got $10
thanks to the guy 602 Oh 665 it's a long
name hey Greg its Raymond just thought
I'd show some support we know this is
Raymond this is I had a friend Raymond
Raymond Chen I don't know if this is
Raymond Chen or not but newer maker you
know Raymond Chen well I don't know you
might not know him but he was like super
smart like math genius like the guy knew
his math like him and my brother were
the math guys I was just like interested
in science he stuff but uh Raymond was
really smart dude and that kind of lost
touch with him after middle school just
cuz he went to a different high school
than I did but uh we were catching up a
few days ago so thanks for stopping by
Ray I appreciate that and for the
support by the way Greg I love your
videos thanks Nicholas
let's see someone says why did you start
YouTube I did it because I was bored as
heck over one summer I did take some
summer classes in college and I was
super bored all the time and I'm not the
kind of person who goes out and parties
and does all kinds of stuff that typical
teenagers and you know early 20s as
males do so I decided to start a YouTube
channel and at the time I had 100 or 200
so subs I was just uploading sciency
stuff stuff that I was researching just
on my
that I wanted to share with people who
were interested in same things that was
how was Michael Evan doing Scott D
McLovin is doing okay happen I haven't
hung out with him too much lately he's
been super busy the guy works a lot that
is Raven hey Raymond Raymond was
confirming that it was him yeah he's a
super cool guy super smart he's very
humble that he was he's a really smart
guy let's see is the r5 1600 a good CPU
and can it can it stream it can stream I
mean can stream about as well as an i7
can I would say I haven't done exact
testing but I mean you got more cores
than the i7 and you got decent
overclocks too so I would say around 4
gigahertz r5 1600 should be a decent
streaming CP especially for a budget
oriented consumer what was the other
question I was supposed to supposed to
answer a question from somebody else I
completely cut them off
something about McLovin McLovin is doing
well he's just really busy but we're
trying to push him into making more more
more videos because I think his videos
are pretty awesome and more of you guys
need to support him that'll encourage
him if you guys go over to his channel
and subscribe he will want to do more
videos like it's just been you know he's
been working a lot and I think that that
sub booster the viewcount boost would
really encourage him where do you get
your hair cut so I actually for the most
part cut my own hair which nobody
believes but I seriously like I'll stand
in front of a mirror and I'll just I'll
use scissors and I'll use a razor for
like the back and the sides and stuff
and I'll cut my own hair just cuz it's
free you know my mom used to cut my hair
all the time because that was free my
you know want to go pay a barber if my
mom could do it for me yes my mommy cut
my hair but hey save some money and she
did a good job to be frank that's a Oh a
$1 donation from lol corporation it's a
very interesting name you got there can
you give me a channel shout-out please
it you know it yo boy leo and how old
are you so yo boy Leo asked how old I am
I am 22 I will be 23 at the end of
October most people find that shocking
like throw your you're pretty young we
thought you were older I always thought
I looked my age or younger than my age
so I guess that's I'll take that as a
compliment I
yeah let's see how do you do it how do
you you do a good job for cutting around
here I appreciate that
let's see refresh rate for phones I
don't know what that are you just asking
what I think about refresh rates for
phones I mean 120 Hertz would be pretty
sweet on a phone panel but let's be real
I mean I don't like that new iPad that
came out with that higher refresh rate
I'm not sure if it's all viable yet from
a financial statement echnology exist
it's just getting that expensive tech
into a phone that is affordable for the
general consumer
let's see Lois can no sorry man I've
said this in the last live stream but I
can't and I won't talk about politics or
religion or anything that's super
controversial in the channel so I can't
answer your question I do appreciate
your donation I hope you don't feel like
it went to waste but I stay away from
all that because it's just a firestorm
no matter what side you're on or how you
try to justify your point of view you'll
always end up pissing off at least half
of the population let's see
Bruce Lane asks I'm going to Dragon Con
I don't even know what that is dude so
the answer's no but I'll look into that
because I do you know what that is well
yeah that's what it sounds like any con
like that it's just like those are
actually pretty cool events from what
I've seen I've just never been to one so
I would like to go maybe that'll be my
first one I'll look into it
Christopher Calvary five dollar donation
I appreciate that man just ordered all
the parts my first build but I don't
know what to do after it's put together
what are the first steps for actually
getting it working so assuming you've
got it all wired correctly and it
actually powers on the next step would
be to install your operating system
maybe windows maybe in Linux depending
on what you want to do you could even
throw a hackintosh build together after
its assembled it just really depends but
I will say that if you want to install
Windows then I have a video about
showing you how to do that so if you
want to watch that video do that whoa
whoa fractal design $89.99 what is that
hoping you have a majestic AF weekend
mesh if I on a winky face that's
surprising that's really cool actually I
think that the mesh if I see is is being
sold for that price or cheaper
actually really good price I didn't know
that going into the review because it
wasn't on New Ager Amazon yet because
the NDA had just been expired like when
we uploaded the video but that's a
really good price of mesh YC and that's
what this one is right here let's see
what we got here wait whoa
Wu's ballin I know what I just read
let's see a fractal yeah no that's
really cool fractal jumped in I didn't
expect that at all
do you watch Dragon Ball super no but my
brother does actually both of my push
too they're all they're both younger
than I am once a year younger once three
years younger but they watch Dragon Ball
a lot and I every now and then I'll
watch it I'll watch like the fights the
fight scenes are pretty cool but they
just drag everything out it I don't know
let's see gtx 1070 or Vega 56 hmm Vega
56 or G takes 1070 that's a tough one
again I am I always tried a tip in favor
of the better bang for the buck hard and
if you're willing to do some
overclocking and you're willing to eat
the extra power consumption from Vega 56
it looks promising but look the way I
see it is you shouldn't have to
overclock these cards and undervolt
these cards the way that you have to 100
volt Vega 56 in order to get it to be
more powerful and stable enough to pass
the 1070 and most of the benchmarks so
it really just depends on how much time
you want to put into it but it's it
looks pretty compelling the price needs
to drop just a little bit though in my
opinion you know what I'm gonna do for
that $89 donation fractal just did I
just thought of this but this is a good
idea so we're gonna actually give that
away so that donation there 90 bucks I'm
gonna donate that to one of you guys in
this chat and we'll find a way to
contact you we'll we'll work on that
we'll get something ready to go
but that donation from fractal I want to
donate to one of the people watching the
stream so that they can buy their own
fractal fine-mesh if I see at least
that's what I hope you do because it's a
good case and literally like one of the
best I've reviewed a few things I would
change but for the most part you're mean
you're gonna be happy with it because
it's a fractal case straight up let's
see what are your feelings on dyeing
your hair white well I don't have any
feelings on it right now because I don't
plan on dying it white anytime soon
unless something dramatically changes in
the sub
of course around 500 CE or 500 a
thousand subs that's that's when the
hair dyeing will happen so we'll see
here
what was that will I needed to say
something on Twitter oh yeah there we
got like that okay okay so do we have
the tweet for the live stream starting
on Twitter yeah so send out a tweet if
we don't already have one
so that'll way that'll be the way you
guys can enter so if you have and it
kind of limits people to just Twitter
though I I don't want them to feel like
they only have to have Twitter to enter
this giveaway hmm now we'll split it
we'll split it so we'll do 45 here we'll
just use PayPal and then we'll do 45 on
Twitter so if you want to chances to
enter I mean if you're in the chat
that's already good that your second
chance to enter go to Twitter and
retweet whatever we're about to show on
Twitter regarding the live stream just
retweet that and there's your entry so
45 bucks it's still using some cash and
you can thank fractal design for that
donation that I did not expect that was
super cool of them have you noticed a
trend in games using more CPU than
before I used to get CPU limited with an
i-5 35 50 changing it out to an i7
brought my fps up by 35% so that's
actually kind of been the norm
lately I did a test right I checked
Pentium performance against AI 3 i5 i7
performance using a gtx 1070 or 1080 i
want to say and I have a video
discussing how frame rate scale as you
increase cores and threads with hyper
threading in the case of Intel so that
video in which be Google at how many
cores do you need for gaming I think is
the name of that video but that'll
answer that question for you and at
least graphically let's see do you play
csgo if so what rank no I tried playing
csgo and I suck like I I'm so bad
so no I'm if I'm not even ranked it's
just not not possible let's see what do
you think Ram prices will stabilize I
haven't done enough research and that
yet I just know it's been pretty crappy
lately like you buy a 16 gig kit right
now for what
for $100 and I'm pretty sure a year ago
you could buy the same 16 gig kit for
like let's 60 70 bucks I mean like an 8
gig kit which was the standard four
years ago was $40 you know now it's
twice that it's pretty ridiculous and it
comes just with a territory all these
different memory manufacturers Samsung
micron working on the new 10 nanometer
architecture and that's shorting the
supply in a nutshell again just kind of
like some summarizing here but that's
what's keeping prices up because there
is not as much of it being supplied by
the manufacturers let's see you have oh
well we have six thousand six hundred
and sixty-six tweets on Twitter
can you confirm that can you confirm
that if so just post like okay good we
just added another tweet to that that's
the one that's the one they should
retweet where right okay all right so
for those of you who want to have a
chance to win the other $45 so that
we're gonna give away from fractals
donation in the live stream then go over
to Twitter and retweet the latest tweet
on our page it's not the one that's
pinned up top it's the one underneath
that retweet the one regarding the live
stream and there you go you'll have a
chance to win 45 bucks hey that's not
bad 45 bucks for just retweeting
something and chances are and we only
have 500 or so people watching the live
stream so your chances are gonna be
pretty high of winning that so even if
you don't Twitter you still might have a
chance to win if you comment in the chat
one plus five your daily driver now or
just testing for review so I actually
originally wanted to only test the phone
but I've kind of fallen in love with it
and it actually is my daily driver now
my guess seven is back in its box if
that tells you anything
my a sevens battery life went to crap so
I'm really happy to have a phone that
lasts a full day now yeah I know cool
let's see um excuse me what are you
talking who are you talking to so I got
will over here so we'll is that will
you're actually like still looking at my
screen are you sure turn that off
yes it will Bend with them that let's
see I don't have the best internet here
but it's okay we're kind of leeching off
of will stellar internet connection and
a pretty sweet multi streaming platform
so we have here YouTube is just Twitter
know what that was in what context are
you against people who use Apple
products no because I use Apple products
chimp I use a macbook pro 13 inch look
i've liked to at least experiment i want
to know why people feel the way they do
about certain products and that's why i
use them that's why I bought two
thousand dollars worth of Apple products
about a year ago because I wanted to
know what it was like to have just a
bunch of Apple products and this
cohesive Apple ecosystem and I actually
confirmed that in later videos that yeah
I was really impressed with how
versatile all of them were they're not
friendly to outside products if you
don't have an Apple product and you want
it kind of incorporate that into your
sphere of mobile devices it's not gonna
be very friendly but that's Apple for
you everything is proprietary let's see
do you think Vega is worth buying I have
a video on that mr. TT t10 TTT yep
that's another interesting name yeah
video regarding Vega and my conclusions
I don't have my 56 benchmarks up yet but
the conclusions are basically the same
Apple is why let's see Apple's why you
got no money ha good one
yeah but I seriously I buy all of my
Apple products I don't have a sponsor
that sends me Apple stuff what do you
hope of what I think the iPhone eight
what do I hope the iPhone 8 will be
honestly I don't know I'm have to buy it
it's like the note 8 people would keep
asking me what I think about the note 8
and I never got a note 8 but I watched a
bunch of reviews about it just recently
because I didn't watch him when he first
came out but I've been looking at how
people are responding to the no date I
watched some other pretty famous
youtubers out there who were given kind
of mixed signals about it like what
things they did like things they don't
like how it's almost exactly the same as
an s8 save a few tweaks because it's the
note but not too not too interesting in
my opinion the iPhone 8 will probably
catch my eye a bit more than that does
what's my favorite movie
oh gosh favorite movie ever that's a
tough one my favorite movie these like
questions that are so like they require
so much thought I'm gonna say I just
heard something go off I don't know what
it was like a notification I'm gonna say
probably mmm I really like Dante's Peak
that's a really good movie and I was
said was with Pierce Brosnan and forget
her name she was the one who started
terminator as well I don't remember her
name but that was a really cool movie
and I did a lot of stuff regarding
geology in college so I like learning
about all that good stuff
let's see still gonna try to get in to
see my question though what's up
Enoch Lindemann I missed your question
you have to just post it again let's see
what do you think about the LGV 30 still
haven't check that out look I don't
review smartphones or like look in
detail about you know specs or any of
that unless I know I'm gonna have a
phone in my hand to review otherwise I'm
not gonna waste my time so I would have
to have a V 30 I don't have a few 30 but
when I have one if I have one then I'll
be sure to let you know what I think in
a video I 777 hundred K or are 770
hundred X if money isn't an issue it
really just depends if all you're gonna
do is game the 77 on RK is still the
superior gaming CPU with the 1700 X is
the better all-around CPU especially for
the price I would say it's probably a
bit more future-proof most of the time I
would advocate for the 1700 X and in
favor of multitasking the slight
disadvantage of frame rates you will
have maybe 10 to 15 percent reduction in
frame rates with a 1700 X but is that
well maybe not 10 percent depends on
what frame rate you're natively gaming
at let's see how much do you love our GB
not that much anymore I used to be so
big on it but it's just
I usually just set my RGB x' to one
color and make it monochromatic that's I
have a 1440p 444 it's monitor and GTX
970 should I wait for Volta AMD
equivalent to be worth it or maybe hold
out until after that dude I don't know
like that these questions are always
kind of open-ended like it just depends
on how patient you are man like there's
always gonna be something better coming
out at some point just you know just do
what you feel like you needed to if you
want the boo
didn't frame rate and resolution and
in-game graphics then upgrade soon if
you don't care just wait save your money
what do you think DDR rant ddr5 Ram will
launch not sure haven't done my research
on that I just haven't been that
interested in it frankly should I stop
being lazy and apply to university for
cops I probably look I mean it's it's
harder to do something than to not do
something right so you should do the
harder thing in favor of just being
productive and maybe making your life
easier in the future let's see do you
play on consoles too used to play on
consoles but not so much anymore because
I have a PC now and you know PCs are
superior when are you building a
hackintosh sometime soon man look I see
all the mess some of these people have
to go through to get friggin Mac os10 on
their PCs and I just don't know if I'm
up for the task
that's the Cash Giveaway what is this
yeah the Cash Giveaway so if you're
commenting the chat congratulations
you're entered in the Cash Giveaway if
you're under the age of 18 just have a
parent or guardian represent use their
email and I use their whatever to their
their identification let them represent
you basically so you can receive that
money just for legal reasons and then
also retweet the tweet on Twitter that
everyone's retweeting we're not in the
live stream and that's your chance to
win another forty five dollars all this
from fractal design by the way which
surprised me that's kind of how we were
last minute we're working on getting
that money distributed let's see which I
owe a IO do you prefer crack in X 52 or
alpha cool ice beer 240 I haven't tested
the alpha cool is that how you say it
Ice Bear I'm just gonna say I speared
I'm sorry if it sounds stupid I've
tested the crack at X 62 though not the
52 same thing just a smaller rad and I
can say that I mean I really like the
kraken series so it really just comes
down to cost and cooling performance
there is adaptive sync really worth it
like at what async asynchronous compute
I have a video on that I don't know
asynchronous compute adaptive sync I
don't even know I don't know about that
I looked it up any plan for a car video
yes sOooo not many people are into the
car stuff looked at people subscribed
for tech you know computers and whatnot
so that would be
my most of my content with you about
that let's see Greg when will the h7
quad let me review come out been here
since 10 K thanks breaking Ryan that
will be coming out soon so what I'm have
to do is rip this cooler back out of the
PC and get some sweet b-roll and I'm
gonna run some tests on the 7900 X in
here the reason why I'm using this right
now and not the the Rison build is I'll
talk about that in a separate video as
well but basically temps were getting a
little too high on the fluid flow it was
getting like 60 C which is like
borderline for a for a d5 pump and when
the fluid gets that hot it's not capable
of distributing distributing cycling as
much of the heat from the CPU GPU heat
sources to the radiator to be dissipated
you know from the rad because the
temperature differences are not stark
they're not extreme differences so the
ability for the fluid to exchange heat
from the CPU to the radiator was being
hindered because I had my fan curve sat
too low like the pump was spinning
full-speed but I just don't like having
really high fans and a custom loop build
though just kind of defeats the purpose
there so that's that's why I'm not using
it right now I'm have to reconfigure
that build I'll be using Rison again
once I fit another custom movement to
that I actually I might even do a thread
Ripper build depends that's probably
something we're gonna work with be quiet
yeah regarding Oh Florida stuff here we
go what part of Florida you live in I'm
curious how close I am to you I live in
the Panhandle Florida somewhere between
Destin Florida and Tallahassee Florida
you can check a map to figure out how
close you are to me are you Latin your
last name sounds Latin my last name is
Spanish so from Spain that's for my
dad's side the family's from so Salazar
as a Spanish last name do you think
graphics cards will drop in price or
keep increasing they're gonna drop soon
they're gonna drop and they're already
dropping you can you know you can get a
1080 for around or even under in some
cases 500 bucks which was roughly where
they were before of the mining craze
took off urea and whatnot do you watch
Naruto no my brother does my brother
watches all the anime stuff all the
anime stuff you guys are probably gonna
about he watches huh I just I just never
got really into him do you think and
when cases are worth it I've never
reviewed an in one case I think they're
unique but I've just never gotten a
review sample from them we tried
reaching out at one point and it just
wasn't super prompt so we don't have any
of those reviews on the channel to be
frank but maybe someday soon I think
they look cool their unique looking I
don't know I can't really speak too much
about them because I haven't built in
one what are your thoughts on Intel's
eighth generation lineup of CPUs I love
the fact that an i3 potentially
outperforms an i7 from the previous
generation let me be given Intel a bunch
of crap regarding IPC boosts from
generation to generation basically all
the way back to IV Bridgers so I mean
has well to skylake what four percent
sky like 2k be like another four to six
percent it's just not all that exciting
and that's why people have been waiting
so long for AMD to take off with Rison
and they kind of have and for good
reason by the way but I don't know this
is looking pretty good
hey Jen's looking pretty good from the
blue team when can we see another cover
that Les Paul wants to be seen heard
maybe someday sue and I have a couple
people wanting me to do something like
that again I'll just maybe intro a video
with a riff or something like that
completely wireless PC
how would you transmit roughly 3 or 400
watts to a PC from a B could that be
crazy you have to use like a Tesla coil
whoo science let's see oh we got a
donation from virility custom pcs he's
doing his first water cooling build and
a define an OS and he really wants to
use a for Haiti radiator but it won't be
oh okay so this is really custom pcs
excuse me really PC custom that is Tony
okay
Tony is the guy that I've done a few
videos with there they I've talked a bit
about he's done a lot of stuff for us on
the channel I even saw him in st. Louis
for a land fest they had over there but
he does a bunch of really cool unique
stuff with his channel I want to give
him a plug not for the money but because
he's a cool dude and he really does go
out of his way to help me whenever I
have a question and I'd really
appreciate that so that right there
though that reply from Tony the
ten dollar donation that is literally
him a nutshell okay he's serious on his
channel he'll tell you like cool stuff
show you a lot of cool stuff but he's a
really funny dude that's awesome
death bat six nine one six thanks for
the five dollar donation says I was
barely breaking 45 an AC syndicate and
do say do you say that I've actually
never even played that game but I've
heard a few people say that game
differently like Deus Ex or something MD
and almost maxed out in the division now
they run like a dream on the i-765 PS +
what was your cpu before that I don't
remember I think you said with like an
i-5 locked or something if that's the
same person like yeah look and I sevens
gonna be like your best situation right
now for gaming but that's that's just it
it's really only gonna be your best
situation for gaming but yeah I mean
that's that's not surprising
you could put last gen Nvidia or AMD
cards and a system with an i7 and still
get decent frame rates excuse me do you
think horizons 1600 whoops I just lost
that question whoever asked something
about the rise in 1600 I'll just assume
you're asking about its viability it's
one of the best CPUs on the market hands
down and I said that in my 1604 V video
let's see you
yeah $2.00 denied cool $2.00 nishan from
Breaking dimes for some reason he's not
showing up top I guess they'd already
like went away
what's the two dollar donations don't
show up very long that's stupid any
donation should can you recommend in
good cases under $100 so I did a
head-to-head matchup of the NZXT s340
elite and the p400s those are two really
good cases you should consider I also
have done a review on the mesh if I see
from fractal design which is also a
really good case I would say it's its
neck and neck between this and the forum
or the two ones that I mentioned before
that like fractal cases I'm gonna I'm
gonna give you in a nutshell my view on
mid tower cases mid tower case is first
and foremost are probably the best form
factors for PC builds just because that
you can you can do so much with them
omit full towers are a little too big
for me I don't I don't want furniture I
just want small furniture and I TX M ATX
cases are a little too small for most
people MHT X is cool it's unique but
space is usually a concern especially if
I want to do something cool like a
custom loop in one of those so fractal
does the fractal design mesh if I see or
the define see with the tempered glass
that case not only looks beautiful it's
affordable both of them are affordable
under 100 bucks and with a measured by
C's under hundred bucks and the cable
management is just a dream it is just so
easy to cable manage in a fractal design
case it really is even in like their ITX
cases and whatnot like there's still so
much room to work with in their cases so
that's a big plus for me just makes the
build experience good by so smooth NZXT
I think offers the most unique looking
case in the sense that it's probably the
most clean in a sense and it does allow
you to show off some cool components
like if you have a cool-looking SST or
something or want to show off I don't
know just like the inside of your case
like the s340 elites gonna give you that
tempered glass and it's gonna give you
out of that it what I really like is
like when the case outside matches the
inside color so a white case white
inside white interior that looks really
cool that's why I like the white NZXT
s340 elite and on the P 400 is just like
a really really custom custom loop
friendly PC there's a lot more space in
that and there isn't yes 340 elite and
there's a bit more space in yesterday 40
elite than there is in the fractal
defined C mesh if I see so it really
just depends on what you want to do but
that's my summation of like cases
they're American cosworth appreciate the
domination man I'm sorry if I missed
anyone else above that I'm sorry that I
was talking for so long there can I
didn't see any questions well let's see
couldn't agree more about fractal cases
yellow guy it took me a while to get
into fragile design because I just I was
into the more ostentatious stuff I said
this in my match if I see video but I've
really come to appreciate just the clean
look of fractal cases and how easy like
it if you haven't built in one you have
to do it at some point to see and to
know exactly what I'm talking about here
and anyone else who's built in a fractal
case like this form factor small or even
bigger will tell you the same thing just
a breeze to build in let's see do I have
to donate to get you to answer my
questions no but there are many many
people asking asking questions here so
unless you want me to multiply myself by
50
be difficult to answer everyone's
questions let's see I got a scroll down
to the bottom here close to the bottom I
don't know why but my phone can be dry
all day but as soon as I oh the good
Suzy watches porn everybody calls him
and asks him what he's doing why love
the work appreciate that mail thanks for
the laugh man you know it's just perfect
timing it always tends to be perfect
timing when it comes with stuff like
that when's the next gosh diddly dankes
list video I've actually got one filmed
and Tony from virility PC Kustoms helped
me film that when he's actually a guest
in that in that video so we'll have that
video up probably tomorrow cuz Saturdays
tend to be pretty big for just funny
videos like that so we'll see see if we
could do it by then is RGB worth it
sure is the AMD athlon x4 8:45 and a gtx
1050 a good budget build yeah I would
try to bump that CPU up maybe a tear or
two our generation or two the x4 it's
not the most recent and your IPC jump
from that to rise and is gonna be
substantial so try if you can to go rise
in and keep that gtx 1050 in there
let's see 7700 k or wait for coffee lake
these questions are kind of vague like
if you need a pc now by the 7700 k if
you want to wait and you can wait wait I
mean anything it'll pay off if you don't
need a PC right now let's see can I see
the dog oh I don't know where she oh no
she's under the bed
oh hey misty misty no she's asleep right
now she's under the bed like just like
sprawled out sideways so let's see how
was Germany Germany was super cool it's
a super beautiful country and I will be
going back very soon I really enjoyed
that trip let's see can you recommend a
good gaming laptop for under $1,000
I haven't owned a gaming laptop for
under $1,000 haven't even reviewed one
frankly although I am familiar with many
of their specifications I would say Asus
makes a really good one on Amazon it's
like 800 bucks and it comes with a gtx
960m something like that it might even
be cheaper now because they have the new
gen stuff coming
but like a year ago that was a really
good buy because it came with a
dedicated graphics processor and a 1080p
display and stuff and a decent CPU if
I'm if I'm not mistaken as well I think
it was a true quad-core I don't know
what it was called but yeah I don't do
too much with mobile laptops right now
mobile laptops with laptops
I would like to though I really I really
would like to let's see dark YouTube
doesn't show chat that blows visits the
text the same color as the background
because if so that would be hilarious
let's see
best a.m. for ATX motherboard well it
depends what for the price are just in
general there's some pretty good a.m.
for boards out there that just from like
a objective standpoint I really am a fan
of the asrock X 370 Taichi board
it's a beautiful board and it's got
excellent dev support when it comes to
UEFI updates and if you're looking for a
good budget budget motherboard the msi
be 350 gaming plus or gaming Pro one of
those models I reviewed that on the
channel as well that's a good budget
oriented a m4 board what gives you the
motivation to continue making videos so
I'll be frank it's a job right like if I
stopped making videos I'm not gonna
really make money so I'll have to do
other things so like I kind of have to
have to work right so this is a job to
an extent but it's a job that I really
enjoy doing and that's why I hopefully
can keep doing this and the only way to
keep doing this if I have the support of
all of you
so those watching the livestream
especially you guys have gone above and
beyond to make this channel what it is
because you're willing to go out of your
way to watch a live stream that you know
won't be live in an hour so so thank you
for that let's see here what do we have
would you make a video praising the i3
750 K finto gave you stupid money no and
even if they did I tell you what if they
if Intel came to me and said hey we want
to pay you insert big figure money here
to promote the i3 73 50k I would
probably probably make a video talking
about how until try to get me to say
that I would probably just expose there
they're like just sneakiness you know
until would never do that they would
never say hey like promote the product
we're gonna give you money for that's a
paid review and that's
sneaky if you ask me I'm pretty dirty so
I don't think it'll do that
hypothetically speaking but if they did
if if any crooked company wanted to pay
me to say only good things about their
product then I would probably just make
it public I would say this company's
pretty shady and they don't really have
much faith in their product what does
that tell you about the faith in their
product if they if they know they need
to pay you to say good things about
their product they probably don't think
it's very good there you go there Rick
Perry five dollar donation I appreciate
that thank you very much that it's
awesome of you science to do eight 350k
beats i seven yeah I know that's that's
pretty serious if that is the case with
H 8th gen intel yeah we're talking some
serious serious performance gains that
would be awesome
Gordon mah shirt I own an Enzo Evo it
excuse me and though evolved micro-atx
tempered glass it's a good case I own I
own the micro I know them mini ITX
version of the evolved tempered glass
was the tempered glass no it was just a
regular acrylic panel wandering in my
custom loop if I have a 140 ml rad rear
and a 280 rad front intake is that the
right setup I have an r7 1700 and twin
Vega 56s so yeah I mean as a general
rule of thumb you want to keep it to at
least one small rad per component in
your sister major components so graphics
card CPUs I recommend keeping at least
one 120 for the CPU or one 140 I mean
look you can power and you can take an
AI o 120 and cool a CPU right you might
not get the most stellar overclocks but
you can do it same with the graphics
card so take that analogy and that
example and apply it to your radiator
config so if you have a 240 up front you
said are at 280 up front and a 140th
rear that's a 140 millimeter rad
essentially for each of the three
components in your system Vega 56 runs
pretty hot I wouldn't try to push over
clocks too much unless you under bolt
and do some tricky things there but I
mean they should be fine with that
config I don't think there's any red
flag there at least Oh roll mixed
rolling ttyn $15 donation I appreciate
that thank you man first time on your
live stream must donate dude this guy
right here that's a true champ I
appreciate your diamond I really do I
appreciate you guys support even if
you're not donating you're just watching
the stream it's really awesome it's
encouraging for me I mean it gets me
excited because I know you guys are
interested in the same stuff I am that's
what the channel is all about now let's
see just a duck says hey Greg I don't
have any money to donate but I to keep
up the great work I always love your
videos more than the bigger channels PS
best cheap mid-tower for black white
build and the z 270 motherboard best
cheap mid-tower cheap what are you
talking cheap like 50 60 bucks or like
80 $90 cuz I mean cases go for like $200
and higher than that that's a tough one
he's black and white fantex makes a
pretty cool black and white case P 400
actually there's another case coming out
soon the P 300 which will be a bit
cheaper if I'm not mistaken so keep your
eyes peeled for that one Americans
American Cosworth says for five dollars
did find that awesome thank you for the
$5 donation man AMD APU hopes beyond the
I am for AMD a twelve ninety hundred
potential for a single board mini ITX a
gaming rig yeah not too sure yet on the
performance of their new way in for ap
use but it would be pretty sweet if all
you had to do for 1080p gaming was drop
a CPU or AP for that matter into a
motherboard and just call it a day no
dedicated graphics card no discrete
graphics needed just an APU that would
be awesome I'm kind of doubting that but
that would be pretty awesome so we'll
see and hopefully I can get my hands on
some of those CPUs to test the viability
of those Rick Perry a $2 donation thanks
Rick Perry appreciate that
let's talk stiff two dollars are you a
wrestling fan I'm not a wrestling fan I
have a few friends that are it's pretty
big in the south but I just can't get
into the I'm gonna be frank it's a
little cheesy for me I mean like even if
you don't tell me that it's fake I'll
I'll still know just because some of
it's pretty obvious you know you think
they would work on their camera angles a
bit and like maybe show hits from behind
where you can't tell if they're just
like grazing them or not but that's how
that's how I feel about wrestling I just
can't get into the fact that it's not
actually real most of it anyway
the guy 6:02 Oh 665 $20 nation thank you
did not want to be beaten beaten out by
someone named troll McCullen
okay I appreciate that thank you
I guess that's that's an interesting way
to look at it but thank you for your
donation again your support let's see
the writing and the wrestling is
horrible these days yeah it just it just
all comes across as too cheesy for me
Brian Spencer dollar donation I
appreciate that Brian thank you very
much for your donation Scott D so
whatever happened to your motherboard
with the broken dim slot did you ever
replace the board I haven't actually
contacted them yet
but I did take that CPU put it another Z
270 board and all four slots work fine
so those suggesting that it was just a
channel dead in the CPU that's a valid
assumption and that was I guess not the
case because the CPU is working fine on
the other board so I'm not really sure
why that one channel on the board
actually died but that's that's the gist
of it I have to contact them and get a
swap I haven't done that yet death bat
six nine one six five dollar donation
thank you guys Jesus thank you for this
I was on an i-5 yeah that's right he was
on the i-5 locked i-5 and that thing was
200 powerful even the 1050 ti4 what I
play that's pretty insane not gonna lie
but look I mean that's that's just some
games nowadays yeah I think you're right
what you said earlier games are now
starting to leverage more cores look if
CPUs mainstream have four six eight
cores like Rison starting to do now and
what it seems like Intel is going to do
with their six core lineups if that's
mainstream developers are going to take
advantage of those extra cores what you
do though if you're a developer at least
in a nutshell if you're gonna optimize a
game for six cores you're hindering the
performance of those who only have
dual-core CPUs and quad-core CPUs so
there's there's an incentive to not
optimize for more than X number of cores
because most of the general consumer
like the just your demographic most of
them are gonna have dual or quad core
chips and so you don't want to keep them
held back because they're using older or
just inferior architecture so it's it's
hard to get developers to move on to the
best the latest and greatest because
a lot of people at least in the
beginning move on to the new stuff right
away they had to can't afford to do it
or the parts just aren't available in
their countries or they just don't feel
like they need to because devs are gonna
be on board with them so that's kind of
why developers really I mean there's
kind of a fine line there some
developers just say hey will optimize
for as many cores you give us some of
them will hold back for the sake of
keeping the majority of their audience
happy let's see here whoa Russell okay
some appreciate the $10 donation man I'm
I've always appreciated your approach to
technology now you present it Thank You
it inspired me to try my own custom loop
and it turned out fantastic that's for
what you do I appreciate that man thank
you I'm glad that it turned out all
right for you let's see so well said why
two names I don't know what you mean by
why two names what did we mean like two
names I didn't know that make fun pants
$10 donation I appreciate that thank you
hey Greg thanks for retweeting my white
hair Photoshop ah this was the guy who
did it so at 500k subs I said that I
would dye my hair white and that's I
guess what you guys are gonna hold me to
now we'll see if you remember and so
this guy right here mr. mcfuzz pants
with his $10 donation was the person who
generated what it would look like in a
picture if I had white hair kind of
looked like Jay from Jay's two cents not
gonna lie it was a little freaky we
looked like brothers there so I don't
know if I'm okay with that I'll have to
talk to Jay about it see if he's okay
with it what are the odds that you think
you'll like the way it looks
oh yeah I might I don't know picture me
with white hair right now I'd probably
look 20 years older and I'll I'll just
get really angry at my neighbors when
they you know touch my lawn that's we
have here hey dude I bought a GTX 1060
windforce
for $350 then I found out that gtx 1060
that i do that that do I have to what
that do I have to get the wind force or
is it the same
I don't know me that I don't even know
what's going on there what was it what
was the question
I mean it's 1060 like they're gonna be
different ai B's whatever different
variants in the same car just check
overclock that's really where you'll see
the difference please make a video on
thunderbolt 3
external graphics card for laptops
please please please please please I'll
try that I will and I've XPS 13 where I
can try that should work out well I just
need to get a GPU enclosure to test I
want Volta and 8th gen intel to come now
yep so do i and actually see the way
this is gonna work you're gonna have
you're gonna have this new stuff come
out and then you make oh but I'm gonna
wait for I'm gonna wait for the next
stuff to come out the new architectures
to come out that's it says there's an
endless cycle it's how people make money
how corporations make money how did you
get into working with pcs I built my
first PC uh my I built my first PC i've
used pcs growing up but like i built my
first pc 3 years ago to help with my
edits when i first started the channel
when I was just doing sciency stuff and
then people really want to see more PC
stuff so I said ok and I started doing
more PC related stuff let's see what do
we have here
are you a Rick and Morty fan I've got to
admit I'm actually not and it's just
because I've never watched it people
talk like it's kind of like Game of
Thrones
I don't watch Game of Thrones because
everyone talks about Game of Thrones and
I'm just like I'm gonna purposefully
object to it and not follow suit because
everyone else is I'm just like that like
one guy who doesn't want to be a
follower and I'm kind of like that with
Rick and Morty because all my friends
talk about how good Rick and Morty is
and I just haven't sat down and watched
an episode I'm sure once I do I'll be
hooked that's how it usually is mr.
Starrett 55 $5 donation thank you for
that been building pcs for 25 years and
I still find myself learning something
on your channel great content and
presentation thanks a ton I appreciate
that thanks for being humble man like I
a lot of this stuff when I make these
videos about IPS force AMOLED or
whatever it could be anything DirectX 11
and 12 or how a CPU works most of the
stuff I have to learn before I mean like
I have to learn on site before I make
the video I have to do my own research
my own due diligence to the topics at
hand before I publish the content
because I don't want to publish that
that's not true obviously and so that's
why at the end of it for video I say
thanks for learning with us I say us
because I want to include me because I
learned too when I make these videos and
that's what I want everyone to know I'm
not trying to act like I know all this
stuff
or beforehand because I don't most of it
I don't know beforehand I just like to
learn about it and that's in most cases
why these videos show up on the channel
what do we have here
oh one others another donation six
dollars is 66 cents okay okay I'm not
going to question that but thank you for
the donation mr. trucker bomb I'll send
you my own in win three or three if you
want to do a review on it you know what
I might take you up on that man I
actually might do that I think that the
303 is a pretty cool looking case and it
is probably the first one I would ask
for a review sample if I contacted in
win so I might take you up on that send
me an email then business emails from
the on YouTube go ahead and send me one
send me busy mo for serious about it
let's see what kind of cooling would you
recommend for a silent and cool build
you can honestly build a silent TC of
she's barking mess T's barking what's
going on oh you guys want to see the dog
now I'll go get her you guys wanted to
see her right here come here Missy oh
whoa oh there's the furball hey do you
see all those people yeah there's all
those people that's there you go folks
there's the dog oh yeah you guys were
asking for her oh cameo today's live
stream there she is she is a wolf sable
Pomeranian by the way for those who were
wondering she's she's got a she's got a
little temper though she's a little
spoiled I'm not gonna lie let's see hey
great what do you thin icon D 3300 if
I'm not mistaken the 3300 is a 60fps
camera that was like the first of the
3000 series Nikon cameras to implement
1080p 60fps progressive filming so that
that would be for a decent look it's not
it doesn't have the best sensor and it's
not gonna film the best I would say for
around a couple hundred dollars more try
your best to get something like a g7
from Panasonic that's a really
well-regarded camera for the price and
sometimes it's on an amazing sale so
look for that one what do we have here
what do you think of risin thread ripper
I think for most people they're not
gonna really take advantage of all of
the sea views offerings of the 1950 ex
especially like look if you can find a
game that will fully utilize 10 cores
even remotely come close to utilizing 10
cores then show me because I don't know
what that game is so for gamers doesn't
really make much sense for hardcore
streamers if you're doing a lot of like
developing and stuff in the background
while you're gaming while you're
streaming while you're streaming YouTube
and bunch of other stuff too I don't
know I I really don't think 10 cores are
necessary you'll be extra future-proof
but for most people look at 1700 or a
1700 X it's just as good you won't tell
much of a difference at all do I like VR
yes I love VR I was really impressed
with how well the HT HTC vive was
handled gaming just performance in
general like I hooked up a system
similar to this one and like just PC
power wise and it was so fluid so good
you got to have a beefy computer to back
up the framerate needed I think for
humans for like up close viewing 90 FPS
I want to say is what you need to not
get like a serious headache because your
your eyes will see the choppiness 60 FPS
up close especially so there's like fur
floating Thank You misty for all the fur
but it's worth it I really think it's
worth it eventually I'll buy one I'll
buy one soon do you think an Rx 580 Plus
70 hundred X would beat a GTX
1070 r5 1400 in gaming that's tough it
depends on the game I would say it
really depends on the game and how how
much of the CPU that game leverages for
most cases I would say you're better off
with an Rx 580 7700 K just my two cents
only because the r5 1400 might not cut
it for some games just it just depends I
don't know I like the the high clock
speed of the 77 okay there let's see
what 444 it's monitor would you saw him
about a hundred 44 is monitor what would
you think about 144 it's monitor for
whatever price I'm gonna be reviewing
one soon
a company called via Tech I want to say
they're sending one it's only like a
three hundred dollar panel but it's a
1080p panel 144 Hertz for what three
hundred or so bucks not a bad deal so
I'll be reviewing that soon to answer
that question in full six-pack actually
yeah I do have a six-pack we have here
from market een marketing i think i said
that right my friend said ice under cage
stock reaches high seventy high 70
degrees with a be quiet pure rock temps
spike up quick by the way normal i would
say it's probably just a crappy thermal
interface between the heat spreader atop
the dye and the dye itself deal with
your cpu man i know you shouldn't have
to do that with a cpu that you buy from
a company like Intel but that's
seriously what I would do to fix the the
heat issue what's up hey you boy he said
Greg all I saw was a you boy but he said
Greg maybe that's someone I know
why aren't gtx 980ti prices not going
down that's a pretty bad deal that used
to be pretty low they used to be cheaper
than ten 70's and ten 70s were almost i
mean they're almost identical in terms
of performance they were just a bit more
conservative on power and heat but i
think it's just because of miners
frankly I would just blame miners let's
see is a 1080 overkill for two 1440p
displays I missed that I don't think
it's overkill know if that was your
question Samsung Galaxy s8 or LG v 30 I
don't know having looked at the the V 30
I really haven't and I haven't reviewed
either phone so I wouldn't know brought
like a shirt would you recommend a hyper
212 Evo oh I can't keep up with these
I'm sorry I can't keep up with a chat
see would you recommend a hyper 212 Evo
or something else it was something else
I missed it no I can't find it I really
can't find I'm sorry I don't know where
oh I can't believe that let's see Greg
do you recommend a studio softbox light
that only supports one light bulb for
making videos I have a soft I have two
soft boxes that support five light bulb
it's like a thousand watt kit but I mean
I don't know of one that's just a single
light bulb I don't know I just got these
because they were cheap I didn't want to
pay the extra price for an LED panel is
a 29 inch ultra wide too small for ultra
wide no m1 midget
like m1d g3t and let me just go buy
midget I have the review of my 29 inch
lg ultra wide on the channel so look
that one up onto youtubes let's see what
is your favorite case with tempered
glass and good water cooling support so
if water cooling support like I'm
assuming a custom loop is a priority for
you
the p400s tge is a great option because
it has so much room it's a really long
case if you think about even though it's
mid-sized it's really long I would say
this is the mesh if I see here it will
come out to about here that's a solid I
don't know how long that is I would say
4 inches or so so what 8 9 centimeters a
little more than that that extra space
is good for reservoir good for the extra
radiator up front and the fans you need
that space for a custom upin and a
fractal define sea or mesh if I see it's
it's just it's cutting it really close
there's not too much space here for this
custom loop and that's kind of why I'm
on air right now it's just really
difficult to fit all that stuff in there
let's see a destiny to weasel yeah some
games will it really depends on the game
and with respect to CPU utilization we
have here
yo bro that was whoo I don't have this
number was it a you boy was that no way
is that is that Stevens little brother
no way let me know I got it I gotta find
this out I don't know if it I don't know
if it is or not
have you weird a bunch of people that I
used to go to school with there on the
chat that's really cool
what's your dog's specs I don't know
she's just like I would say running a
spoiled 4 gigahertz processor she's
super spoiled so she needs to cool down
a lot she's really spoiled she really is
but she's sleeping right now so she
looks cute let's see oh yeah you're
older than him I'm sorry I'm sorry John
I'm sorry I'm sorry so this is Jonathan
al okay and John is older than his
younger brother Steven who I graduated
with in college and Steve enjoyed the
national fair enough Steven John you
joined the National Guard I'm pretty
sure right I think was Army National
Guard so yeah thank you for your service
man I'm pretty sure you're still
pretty sure you're still there are you
were there for a while and I think
you're kind of like working into school
and stuff kind of do them both I don't
know I'll have to catch up with you man
which to buy a Ford Focus RS or a
slightly used audi s3 bro I own an Audi
okay go with the Audi s3 that's all I'm
gonna say that's do you like miners look
I don't blame miners for doing what
they're doing like I can't hate them for
wanting to make money okay and it's not
like they're really they're not doing
anything bad to to us I mean really
they're they're indirectly affecting
prices they're not buying the cards to
make the prices go up I think the people
you should be angry about are the people
on eBay who are price gouging you okay
wanting to sell their freakin rx4 80s
for five hundred and fifty dollars and
some of you idiots will go out there and
buy a card for five hundred and fifty
dollars okay you're enabling them don't
do that
all right don't do that no matter how
bad you think you need the card it ain't
worth five hundred fifty bucks that's my
take on it okay that's how I see things
let's see oh by the way um will reminded
me here so for those who are new to the
live stream if you want to win a $45
PayPal credit we're just gonna send 45
bucks to to people because fractal
design hopped into the live chat and
said hey here's 90 bucks for sporting a
they were just happy to wear sporting a
mesh if I see which can't blame me for
it's an awesome case but I'm gonna go
ahead and give that money away to two
people so if you're in the chat one of
you is gonna win the $45 there and then
if you go to Twitter and retweet the
live you know like the rule live tweet
on my Twitter page it's linked in the
video description by the way then you
can have a chance to win another $45
PayPal gift so yeah I think that's
pretty cool air let's say we get a $5
donation from Dalton fair I think is
that your name right fair I appreciate
the donation would you consider doing a
build in the thermaltake core p7 excuse
me so yeah we have a few cool projects
coming up with Thermaltake Thermaltake
is actually doing they they have some of
the best sorry I'm like twisting my arm
armrests here they have a lot of really
cool cases when it comes to water
cooling support they are very custom
loop friendly so I'm actually gonna
contact them soon about getting a p7 and
maybe even something like where the Vue
21 or the Vue 31 the one that has a
really cool like going window I think it
looks pretty unique so we'll see what we
can do there yeah well we'll do
something the p7 at some point I'm sure
what do we have here make more videos
about the Audi I would I might do one
here there I'm gonna do probably
something else within the next couple
weeks like people just don't they don't
subscribe for the car stuff and I
actually lose some sometimes when they
see car videos on the channel like they
see a car video they're like oh the
contents changing then the and stuff
like dude it was one video of like a
hundred that I've uploaded but that's
how thick old people are so it's why I'm
kind of antsy about the car videos but
now upload one soon and what do we have
here don't
whoops I missed it I don't see any
Twitter link in the description well
will if you're watching will add Twitter
add social media links just go to my go
to one of my latest videos and copy and
paste that stuff into the livestream
description that would be that would be
really helpful or I'll do it just let me
know if you're busy what are your
favorite gaming mouse and any
recommendation for a budget gaming chair
so my gaming mouse of choice it's just
the I think it's km 570 I want to say no
I'm I'm miss naming whatever this is
from gigabyte or from g.skill but this
is a g.skill gaming mouse and it's
actually a really good mouse it was a
little a little hard to get used to like
the super sensitive like high DPI gaming
mouse thing because I use just a cheap
mouse for the longest time but I've
fallen in love with it and it would be
probably pretty difficult to switch to
anything else what do we have here
favorite tech tuber with under 50,000
subs I already gave a spot to Tony I
think Tony at Averill TPC Kustoms I
think he's got a really cool stuff he
does a lot of really cool projects with
his channel so go over to his channel
check his stuff out I don't think it we
disappointed nobody have here oh I see
why I see one low in 21 21 says pancakes
or waffles
the answer is pancake
okay on to something else I only
unsubscribe to channels to consistently
upload videos don't care about it see
super qbo at least you like you give him
a chance right you say well okay here's
one video I don't really want to see if
you see it recurring there like if I
upload just straight car videos for a
week and I don't give you guys any
notice about it I wouldn't blame you for
thinking the contents changing wouldn't
blame me but if I upload one video about
a car about my car people will unsub I
don't know if it's because like they
think that I paid a ton of money for my
I paid like twenty thousand dollars for
my car okay that's less than people pay
for a new Honda Civic if that tells you
anything but that was the reason some
people unsub some people in sub because
it was a car vide and I thought content
was changing people are like I said
really fickle and it's just frustrating
sometimes mmm I'm a thermal taking
pancakes chill hey man I'll be a pancake
chill all day long and you don't have to
pay me for it why do you have a
different PC every week do you sell your
old stuff no I don't sell much stuff at
all I've ever liked stuff that companies
give me for free it would be pretty
dirty if I turn around tried to sell
that stuff so usually if I sell stuff
it's just like 20 bucks like I said 20
bucks for motherboard 20 bucks for this
case 20 bucks for this AIO just because
I don't want people to show up and take
everything at one time so I use the
price buffer there to keep people from
buying everything that I have to sell
but like when I moved from Louisiana to
Florida
I sold a bunch of stuff just $20 flat
because I didn't wanna have to look at
all back home or rent a u-haul for that
matter
how many subs did you lose after the PC
winners were announced
I didn't notice too many I lost I think
I lost a tree it's tough I think like
two 250 subs of course I don't know if
that's just like if it's gonna be a
residual thing or like less and less
people will continue to continue to
unsub after that fact but not too many
but people did unsub and I was just it
just frustrated me because I know
they're only there for the giveaways and
that's why I made the video that I made
regarding the like just the fact that
some of these people leach off of
channels for giveaways and they leave
when they find out that they don't win
that's why we're handling giveaways
differently that video is also on the
channel recent upload you or I missed it
I didn't know you were from Louisiana I
should have given you a degree no I'm I
went to school in Louisiana but I'm
from Florida I was actually born in
Tennessee but I've lived in Florida most
of my life
okay so awesome will Humphries has added
the links to the description so if you
want to retweet the live tweet that we
just tweeted that was a lot of tweet
tweeting in one sentence then you have a
chance to win out there $45 via PayPal
that's the USD so just retweet that
there's your entry and yeah get a chance
to make some cash and you can thank
fractal design for donating that $90 to
the live stream what do we have here
what have you oh well voltage do you run
your 6700 K at 4.6 eager Hertz I run it
at 1:00 this is gonna sound pretty
painful but I run it at one point four
volts that I think that's that was the
latest voltage I had I used to be able
to run at one point three eight and then
eventually crapped out on me went to one
point three nine crapped out on me went
to one point four that's as high as I'm
going okay
intel says one point five two I think
four skylake is like the extreme maximum
before serious stuff starts potentially
happening one point four is my cutoff
I'm comfortable with that
let's see we have here Labor Day was
that said this Monday labor days is that
this week oh yeah September what is it
it's the first first Monday of September
I think remember much love Stevie Martin
I appreciate that thanks Stevie SLI
waste of money or no depends on the game
some games are not optimized at all for
SLI or crossfire and some of them really
are I would say in most cases now just
buy a single card that's just how it's
gonna be when are you gonna change your
profile picture on YouTube okay I'll
change it soon alright but I'm keeping
the same theme because Ironman is
awesome speaking of which I want to
answer some of the questions that some
of the people asked on Twitter so I'm
going to pull up the tweet let's see
what do we have here I'll pull this
thing up and oh yeah we got a bunch of
retweets on that thing awesome thank you
for that thanks for participating where
are we here where are we here I'm
looking for the questions yep good okay
so some of the questions you all asked
let's see you're and you might you never
know best microphone best microphone for
youtubers I would say audio technica
at2020 or 8020 35
if you want to buy an XLR system okay
that's what I would that's what I would
do I wish I'd done that sooner I used a
blue Yeti for a while I was a decent mic
until it broke here okay so huh one of
the three in one of the Suites is what's
your favourite drink
my favourite drink is I mean other than
water I would say sprite or like mellow
yellow I think that's pretty solid drink
if you only had six hundred dollars what
specs would your PC have and why I don't
know I'd have to sit down and like
really think about that because it's
really difficult to build a powerful
$600 PC right now in the current market
let's see a new rug Patel asked what
else are you doing other than YouTube I
am NOT doing much of anything right now
I'm working on my master's degree so I'm
getting my Masters in Business
Administration so I have my engineering
degree from ul I'm getting my masters
from ul I'm just doing it online so I
can stay here in the studio or what I've
turned into a studio of sorts to bring
you all content so this is my full-time
job I'm just still enrolled in a
university working on my Master's okay
would you ever shave your beard stubble
thing has this person not seen like me
without stubble I've been clean shaven
in many videos I'm actually gonna
respond to that right now
I've been clean-shaven and many videos
alright here we have here do you plan on
getting a job in your field so my field
would be what my major was my four-year
degree was in petroleum engineering the
oil industry right now is not doing too
great they weren't hiring many people I
graduated I was like the top like 16 in
my class of like 200 or something like
that I don't know I'm just throwing
numbers out but I was like in the top 5%
at least and I still didn't get any job
offers granted I didn't put many offers
out there because I didn't really want
to work in the field I wanted to do this
full-time but the industry is not doing
too well right now can you answer this
that was literally his tweet can you
answer this sure is Sean Patel there's
your answer
let's see what is the future of Vega
will the price go down it I think it
needs to go down and I think eventually
it will go down look prices for
everything go down over time but how
soon will Vega will Vegas price go down
that's
question and will it ever yeah it's
gonna return eventually at some point to
what it was when it was doing when I was
running that bundle thing on the
beginning when it was released now it's
up to $100 or so for each card and
that's that's that pretty much puts it
on par with in video or a little under
par of in video if you consider the
power consumption of each card has would
you buy a graphics card and RAM now or
wait to see what the prices go back down
these like would you buy now or wait it
really depends on you I can answer that
question for you if you want to wait
wait if you want to buy now cuz you need
now by now like don't you know do
yourself a disservice by waiting if you
really need the tech right now when do
you think the etherium thing will go
down Jacobi game says I have no clue I
would say within the next three months
that's what I'm hoping will happen look
graphics card prices are already coming
down because most of the people who
wanted to buy graphics cards for a
theory of mining bought them earlier on
so the demand has like dropped a lot and
that's why the supply is catching up and
prices are starting to stabilize when
pub G wants to put their game on xbox
and it's not even close to being
optimized in PC yet oh I don't know
about that
look pub G is definitely an alpha game
right now it's like in serious alpha
stage but it's still fun to play I would
say what processor need for EVGA GTX 10
ATSC I would say get an R 5 or an R 7
yeah you're getting a bottleneck with
your i5 6600 it depends on what game
you're getting a bottleneck in and at
what resolution your gaming but if your
gaming in like 1440p or 4k I pretty much
guarantee you your iPhone's not
bottleneck in your system unless it's a
game that utilizes more than 4 cores and
4 threads let's see what is your
favorite mechanical keyboard I won't say
what my favorite mechanical keyboard is
because that's pretty much just
preferential I think g.skill Corsair
coolermaster they all make pretty solid
keyboards but my favorite key switch
which I will answer I'm a big fan of
cherries obviously and I think it's a
tie for me between MX browns and MX
blues I think blues feel phenomenal but
browns are just a little more subtle
just they're just softer but you still
get that actuation feeling so I think
browns are solid middle ground but in
just the way that the keys feel blue is
by far the best for me should I invest
an attendee 2ti right now or be patient
and wait for the miners to wear off oh
gosh I don't know I mean should you it's
a question for you I'm not you do you
need one right now or not if you don't
need one right now wait if you don't
want to wait buy one now it's I can't
answer that question for you or Windows
10 updates screwing your build to my
main computer is having so many issues
with them
yeah like Windows the only push these
updates in the middle of stuff that's
really important for me and I really
hate that but not only that I have
noticed in some cases severe framerate
drops as a result of a Windows Update I
seriously have that's happened a lot
back when Maxwell was still big with
Nvidia and like has well was popular but
that was something that I noticed quite
a bit and I have to reinstall software
for some reason I would fix the issue
it's almost like a Windows Update would
conflict with a driver that was
controlling the graphics card I don't
know I did find that stranger though
Billy coffee like will dominate Rison if
the route if the price is right Rison
has has bad IPC and single core
performance compared to Intel Rison
actually does not have bad IPC compared
to Intel you should look that up let's
see how many times have you gotten the
chicken dinner in pub G what is that
what is the chicken dinner am I missing
something I seriously don't know what
that means someone tell me what the
chicken dinner means because I don't
know what that means but I've heard it
before in game I'm like what are you
talking about yeah I saw a Verizon it's
actually the PC they called custom who
build is right here on the floor yeah
appreciate that
tamo Tamara or Rockstar 45 sub
difficulty PC customs awesome I don't
think you'll regret your decision he
makes really cool videos I 383 50k I
already talked about that
rewind the livestream I talked about the
ATT 50k and what I think winner winner
chicken dinner chicken dinner means
winner what oh okay alright that's
that's that was stupid
alright yeah so if I've won no I've come
second before second place I was the
second the last person alive and it
frustrated me I was actually playing
with Chris and a few others people that
I just play with I just started playing
with a few people that actually work
within the PC industry super cool guys
that was really fun we were gonna like
top 10
and top 20 you know we always get pretty
far but you'll always find this group of
people that they did they just like they
act like they're real-life Marines in a
game and I just take us out in a
heartbeat steam name
can we add you you can add me but like I
can't accept friend requests from
everybody that added to me it's just not
possible to keep up with all the
messages and stuff that I would have but
if you want to play games with me the
way I do it now if you want to donate
like even if I got $1 to patreon then
you get access to a discord server where
I can communicate with you directly
we'll play games and stuff like that I
need to do that soon by the way let's
see yeah would you recommend using an
air compressor and blowing also for
cleaning a PC you're using a can of co2
I don't know I just use its compressed
air I got it I don't know that's really
bad for your PC you're not a facilities
use compressed air I think is anything
wrong with it I wouldn't use it to like
clean stuff out your keyboard there are
there proper ways to do that but if you
want dust on your PC you just you know
make sure you're not spitting when you
actually like blow air into your case if
you want to just blow into it get the
dust out or use a proper duster or
something along those lines to clean
your PC why don't I switch to Linux
because I hate coding I hate it with a
passion I don't like doing anything
related to coding and Linux is like you
have to code to even open an application
you have to code I don't like that I
basically have like a textbook of all
the codes that I need to run all the
applications I would need to run I think
that's just a huge waste of time how
well do you think you would do and scrap
your AdWords also it's chukka be jacobi
Oh chucka be why is it not okay I guess
that makes sense Jacobi all right cool
so I'd probably okay I don't know I I
don't think anytime soon I would be
asked in a scrapyard worse but I would I
would do okay I would try to have fun
with it as opposed to post f1 this is a
gear s3 SmartWatch from Samsung I for a
view of it on the channel for Larry who
was asking ya always spit in your case
Carlos yep that's it right there Carlos
saw his quote always spit in your case
that's a surefire way to fix anything I
am making YouTube channel any
suggestions for what like you want a
camera or a light panel or a computer
I suggest spending around 500 to $600 at
least on a good camera and around 300
bucks on a solid audio setup and that
for the most part will get you solid
production quality it's gonna cost some
money but
yeah let's see ello and my dad broke a
computer by blowing into it and getting
moisture yeah that's the concern like if
you just blow into a computer you get
spit everywhere it's just not not good
at all you or Linus and a bare-knuckle
brawl I'll have to talk to lions about
that one I don't know I like to think I
would win love to ask him what he thinks
I only met him once ever and it was a
copy text we didn't really talk much he
was talking to other people but uh yeah
I mean he's a he's got a pretty narrow
frame like I do or pretty much the same
size it'd be an interesting battle
should I get 1080p or 1440p hundred
forty Hertz monitor with 1080p I get a
1440p one forty Hertz just do it
I'm very poor how can I purchase a
gaming PC when I didn't have much money
and I was just starting out with PC
builds I bought a PC built it sold it
for a little more than I bought for it
I'd put like maybe a $50 premium on it
like just for the fact that I built it
but that's all I would do is just tack
on like 50 bucks for the build fee and
then I would sell it on Craigslist take
that extra money build a little better
PC keep working my way up believe it or
not that is how I literally got by on
the channel for the first hundred
thousand or so subs I literally kept
buying and selling PC parts at PC builds
that was just how I worked my way up to
the higher end stuff because excuse me
because I couldn't afford expensive PC
tech either I was just a college student
ah let's see what do you think of LG
ultra wide festival I don't even know
what you're talking about there's a
festival for that hi Greg
r3 1200 or FX 83 74 HTPC the low 4k just
keep it cool with an r3 if you only
gonna spend 100 or so box lioness would
drop me Eric thinks Linus would drop me
in a fight it'd be interesting I'd like
to see if you were correct about that do
you think an asus strix graphics card
would be too heavy for mesh if I see
vertical mod probably not I don't think
so I mean as long as you keep like the
mesh at the back of the case pretty
tight not like too
then the card should stand pretty
vertical it won't sag or anything hey
dude I bought a 1064 350 then I found
out the 1060 Strix is also 350 so what
do I have to do to get the wind force or
is it the same they're pretty much the
same just look at your clock speeds
captain games look at your clock speeds
I mean they're gonna cool slightly
differently if you just return it if you
want the other one I don't know what
you're asking
explicitly do you have a tender I do not
have a tender this is just a weird
application it's just weird
I think Linus is Loki effing psycho why
are you talking about yes he does cool
interest I mean give him the benefit
like he does cool stuff like he does
stuff that like is one of his recent
videos like putting like 40 PCIe risers
together and then hooking up a video
card to one end of it like who would
have thought about that I mean maybe we
all thought about it at some point we're
like now there's no way we would spend
the time or resources to do something
like that but he did it give him credit
for that even if you think he's running
out of ideas he's doing stuff that you
are genuinely curious about and that's
why his view counts are so high with
those videos let's see let's see how do
you get buying college when being broke
scholarships for one I had scholarships
paid for a lot of my stuff just because
I was pretty good student in high school
I graduated fifth in my class I had like
a 4.6 GPA I had taken a lot of college
classes in high school so those were all
free hey Salazar how long do you think
of gtx 1070 and 67 hundred people be
viable for I don't know depends on what
games you want to play and what
resolution you want to play them I'd say
the next three or four years maybe just
kind of throw on a ballpark number out
there let's see do I like strawberries
abso-freakin'-lutely I like strawberries
what non tech youtubers do you watch I
think I usually just use YouTube for
music I'm not gonna lie I'll like play
the same like 10 songs and my music
playlist and that's about it
I just I like listening to music other
than that like funny stuff I don't know
like I don't I like to watch funny stuff
on YouTube that's really about it funny
stuff and you
videos watching the questions go from
tech need a personal celerity ya know it
always takes that one guy he'll like
he'll ask something super personal that
he knows I won't eat that he knows I'll
ignore and then a bunch of people ask
super personal stuff it baguettes at
that point in the chat I'll just end the
Chad because it seems like most of you
already have most like your answers
answered already what you listening to
right now a lot of Bring Me The Horizon
I like Bring Me The Horizon and Breaking
Benjamin those are my two favorite bands
right now let's see what a G 45 60
bottleneck a 10 60 again depends on the
scenario you can't just ask that
question like as a blanket statement
because it depends on the resolution
depends on the game and depends on the
refresh rate the higher the resolution
the less your CPU will matter I'll say
that okay
was a GTX 670 was on a GTX 670 till just
this past month grabbed in 1974 40 bucks
look at the Hat look at that upgrade
that's sweet jumped up a couple
generations for $40 I bet you reap the
benefits of that too that's a solid
upgrade there I think a regular 7200 rpm
hard drive cause FPS stutter and
open-world games all my linear games
work well except GTA 5 interesting check
page filing and stuff like that that
could be an issue with hard drives I'm
not sure what else could be causing the
issue unless your hard drives just
slowing down but you say it's just one
game it's a little weird why so few
choices for rising on ITX oh it's an
intricate new platform and think about
all the stuff they have to squeeze down
into like a small form-factor
yeah it's tough to do friends watching
ever made a hackintosh nope I am not
sure if I want to take the just just I
don't know just run with it I don't know
I don't know if I want to do it I really
don't I don't know if I'm really gonna
like it once I have it on there like I
like my MacBook with OS 10 but I don't
know if I'm like my desktop with the
West Tennis just weird I'm curious what
are your opinions on refrigerating water
chillers like the one coolants offers
what coolant I don't even know what
you're talking about
snow drifter I'm sorry I'll have to get
back with you on that one
Breaking Benjamin is indeed amazing
Casey Reed I don't know how you're
saying your name or not kind of just
wing it yeah if you're great excellent
for verse Envy
envy and see which one do you prefer for
live-streaming I just use I'm pretty
sure it's just on Envy and see right now
I want to say that's what it said - I
didn't pay attention but that's if I can
help it that's the one I'll try to go
for hardware and coding and whatnot
opinions on IGP use ap use I'll tell you
my opinion on AP use once the aim for AP
user released how about that one he
still has an Athlon - x4 640 solid where
are you reading these questions I'm
reading all the questions from the chat
that's where I'm reading the questions
my friend was asking where I'm reading
questions they're all on the YouTube
chat because I'm live-streaming to
multiple platforms so that's why it's
it's all kind of funneling through this
live chat here that's a couple more
questions and we'll call it quits it's
getting pretty late it's been like what
an hour and a half or so so yeah we'll
call it quits here soon what's your

donation from PT gamer ft dad appreciate
that I see I think you're a patreon
supporter too so thank you for the
donation that you guys did go out of
your way to do that I really appreciate
your support
let's talk stiff go check out Chiodos
all's well that ends well
I don't I don't know what that was maybe
I just gave like a spot for a channel
that is into really shady stuff I don't
know whatever thanks for the donation
again let's talk stiff ah okay couple
more here what is your main pair of
headphones I use the Corsair void pros
which I'll be reviewing soon they sound
beautiful they look good
they fit decently I'll be reviewing it
soon like I said my personal like music
headphone set I have a Bose on you
remember what model Bose it was it was
it's a Bose wired not Wireless because
I'm not into that sort of thing wired
noise-canceling headset I reviewed it in
a recent video ok what do we have here
pineapple black olives pepperoni make
the best piece of crackling I said is
disgusting how dare you what do you have
here artichoke that's gross
that's really gross if Linus asked you
to describe your Edwards would you do it
yeah of course I would do it I think
it'd be really fun but I don't think
he's ever gonna ask I don't know why you
guys are like I mean the question i
think the answer the question is pretty
obvious but i don't think that he will
ask me anytime soon
if he does it would be an honor but i
don't think he's going to room tour
please it's just a bedroom i've done
this before but like my bed looks like
trash right now i don't i didn't make my
bed up but my bed's over there and then
i have a closet with all my tech stuff
in it i have a dresser I have a
nightstand right there that you can see
and then above me is all my trophies
from when I was a kid my mics mounted up
here PC monitor this cool like electric
bulb thing I don't know what it's called
illumise storm and I have my Marshall
cabinet stack right there a couple
guitars that's the room tour in a
nutshell but I don't want to show you
how dirty everything is right now I'm in
Hardware mode ok it's really messy right
now well a couple more questions we'll
do a couple more don't have the courage
to get rid of the headphone jack yeah I
just I don't I don't know I prefer wired
connections there they're consistent
like you're not worried about your
Bluetooth cutting off or anything like
that
do you play Zelda no I actually never
played Zelda growing up you know that's
really strange to say but I've never
played Zelda I know maybe that Firelord
neurosis agreed pineapple on pizza is a
sin not a boy that's what I'm talking
about
thanks for the donation by the way I
agree with you $5 or not 5 but I agree
with you pineapple on pizza is indeed a
sin and you should repent can you can
you see RGB fans through the mesh on the
fractal case yes you can yes you can do
that the mesh isn't like too thin or it
kind of blocks all the light you can see
our
ringg fans and all that stuff through
there by new bed I'll buy a new bed here
soon maybe I don't know maybe I won't
I'm too cheap
let's talk stick it's a band that's that
is all cheetos Chiodos Chiodos I'm gonna
look them up after this I'm interested
to see yeah what do people think about
that what is that science isn't a
democracy thing in your thumbnail
science is a democracy it means facts
are facts and you can't argue with facts
so if you're on the losing side of an
argument it's probably because you can't
support your argument with enough facts
because people can't argue with the
truth so if we know something to be true
or if you know when you say something is
a theory right it's been scientifically
proven replicated in closed experiments
then you can say that yeah like I can
call it a fact that my phone is going to
fall due to gravity right that's a an
arguable physical thing right so you
can't you can't debate that you can't
debate about whether or not a phone is
going to fall due to gravity because
gravity is always going to be here
unless something chaotic happens in the
universe and gravity becomes the weaker
force to whatever the force is that
subject over it this is not a democracy
it happens and there's no sense in
arguing that it won't happen because you
know that it's going to so that's why it
says that it's just kind of a bold
statement Fernando Hammond and and
that's a cool last name have an engine
can you please make a gun at installing
dual monitor setups with dual GPUs one
is 1080 Ti and one is a 1050 hmm
interesting
I'm not sure exactly what you're trying
to go for there if you're using two
different GPUs and you're not gonna use
them simultaneously and you'll probably
have to use a virtual machine I would
say to get both of those to work the way
they should see allocate X amount of
cores to one Jeep one computer X amount
of course to the other virtual machine
and there you go but you're not going to
be able to get to the same picture by
plugging the cable into one or both one
yeah that's weird I don't know exactly
what you're going for there it's kind of
strange what is the square root of 144
12 I did not have to think about that
for a second you know I seen you I seen
you something on insta and ad for a PC
super expensive and overpriced oh I sent
you oh he sent me something yeah yeah
yeah so I'm gonna do another one of
those were like you guys send me stuff
to showcase in a video don't worry I
will see most of those I'll go through
them but I appreciate those
contributions because those are pretty
funny frankly is this formula clerk key
flops equals boost clock speed oh god I
have to go back and check I don't
remember explicitly but I will say this
teraflops don't necessarily tell the
whole story okay
it doesn't optimization is a huge part
of that
and the way that T flops are measured
depends on the way that the manufacturer
decides to do it and that's why they
differ quite a bit sometimes I'll answer
one more question one more question
let's see one more question and I'm
going to let's see I'm trying to pick
one I'm gonna pick one pick one being
I'm being very choosy here okay I want
to make sure they get the right question
answered we got a bunch of questions oh
oh I can't keep up a campcube okay oh
Allah from Venezuela it's on to
questions I'll answer that what's up
I think Jorge Morales how you doing from
Venezuela awesome it's really cool we
have international viewers I I really
appreciate all of you viewing but
especially those who aren't close to me
it's really cool Texas A&amp;amp;M is better
than El you got your red Coleman it's
actually ul not Lu but my tuition it's a
lot better than your tuition it's a lot
cheaper that's why I went there
saving money man it's all the same
education in the end one more question
as long as you're accredited which you
are how did you do so good in school I
had no life I studied quite a bit gosh I
think there's so many questions I want
answer more what gets hoarse do you have

customs I have a Fender Strat I have a
Gibson SG and

beautiful instruments beautiful
instruments what is the best GP for
pubsey streaming and also for editing
best GPU for streaming and anything if
you're gonna stream @ 1080p just go to
graphics per little stream in 1080p
little that'll let you play the game in
1080p that's gonna be leverage more on
your CPU in that case shoutout from
Canada what's up Bernard Joseph how you
doing why Radeon continue to change name
and products HD are 7 or 9 I don't know
ask them it's just a weird naming scheme
