part three part three of four now
because I've just way too much stuff to
get done to cram into one video to take
probably another week to push out the
final part which will be the finished
product but what I wanted to do is kind
of show you my raw impressions of two
bending you know it looks it looks easy
when you see the pros do it when someone
like Jay from Jay Z sends Ben's PTT to
me it's like second nature to him he's
even admitted that he's done it so many
times it you know you knows exactly how
long a hole is he knows when the tube is
just right for bending and I experienced
quite the opposite especially when I
first started out I was either keeping
it too close to the heat gun or I wasn't
getting it hot enough if you've seen a
few pics on Twitter you follow me on
social media than you you are well aware
of my frustration so that's what I want
to show you upfront just how frustrating
it was to kind of to kind of jump into
the whole two bending process but then
after a while of course just like
anything else you do get used to it you
get better at it the more you practice I
went through about probably let's see
there are four of these packets in each
large box that you saw in part 1 of ptg
tubing and I think I went through about
three large boxes so I always did a good
you know 50 or 60 feet of ptg tubing
just like practicing and you know trying
to get my first Bend right and I started
off with the most difficult Bend of them
all so you'll see all of that here I do
hope you enjoy or at least find amusing
my frustration with the entire process
okay you want to know what the
definition of insanity is it's repeating
the same process and expecting different
results every single time I got this
heat gun here and I kind of set up some
chairs because these posts are a good
distance away from me from the heat gun
that's you know it's not going to
absolutely torch these PT d2 but I am
extremely pissed off because I've gone
through all this and sorry about the
focus just kind of sitting here because
I've been doing this for the past two
hours and I've trashed everything
literally like some kind of inhaler i
I've had a few close attempts this one
was a pretty
look pretty close okay I'm looking for a
specific Bend to go from my reservoir to
my radiator and this just I mean look
there's bubbles or bubbles down there
the cut isn't straight and the thing is
pretty flat on top maybe because the
silicone inserts that I have are
slightly too narrow so the inner
diameter of the PPG tube is just a
little too a little too big for this
insert so that's why it's kind of you
can see even here on this test run you
can see how the outside turns here are
slightly dipped in from what the
diameter of the pipe should be that's
just because like I said the silicon is
a little narrow so I've got this heat
gun on and I'm going to set the tripod
up and I'm just going to show you what
I've been doing you know I've been I've
been listening to the pros and listening
to Jays to sense and I watched a few
videos from Paul Hardware and you know
just guys that I trust you have done
this a few times and I've been what I've
been doing what I think is correct but
I'm just not getting a solid enough
result that I'm satisfied with at this
point - just want to throw these bends
into project blue sky so yeah just you
know obviously the frustrations involved
with this this isn't you know this isn't
something that anybody can just pick up
and do the first time this takes a lot
of practice and as you can see I have my
graveyard of ptg tubes that will just
never be used for anything because this
is a relatively difficult task
so after becoming extremely frustrated
and just toughing it out basically just
got to keep pushing if you stop and end
up throwing you know like some cheap 90s
in there like 90 degrees fittings and
stuff and it's not a real hard line
tubing built I mean sure you can put you
know straight hard line tubes anywhere
anyone can cut tubing but it takes a lot
of patience actually bend the tubes the
ways that you need them to bend in order
to eliminate the need for those metal
90s and and 45s and such of course there
are instances in which you would
absolutely have to use those fortunately
in this build I don't have any of that
which is why I didn't want to use any I
mean I know I can get away with using
just the tubes themselves so that's
that's why I was really trying sorry I
haven't turned my phone on you that's
why I'm really trying to just make this
whole thing about the PPG and not about
the you know cheap short cut fittings if
you will so the way that I have it set
up now I have this Bend here which is
the one that you just saw that that part
I was working on that this took about 15
attempts I went through how good you
know 20 30 feet of CTD just for this one
Bend so remember we have the tube coming
from the outtake of the CPU Blanc
running to the rear port on the top
radiator and then we have this tube that
I just kind of been it's not really a
probably like a 20 degree angle bent and
then bent bag of course to lead into the
intake of the back red so that's what we
got so far just two of the pipes and we
need another full three but until the
graphics card blocks get here all we can
do really in this video is run the tube
from here to the back red now this is
going to be difficult I'm going to turn
the turn the case kind of sideways here
in a second you'll see what I'm talking
about but there are a few things that
make this particular vendek's tremely
difficult to do
I haven't even attempted it yet because
I know this one's probably going to be
tougher than this one I now see that so
what am i have to do is either fit at 90
on here immediately kind of like this
one here and just kind of already start
out that way
all right cameras on and just kind of
already start out that way or I can have
I'll just write it like this at a geek
order here and I'll just kind of let it
pop out and then bend it and then
bend to the end but then once I bend it
again I'm going to have to realign it to
make sure that it'll properly align with
the rear port here so there's just a
bunch of stuff involved with this one
with this one to bend that is going to
be very challenging so I figured I would
film this one because this one's going
to be the most difficult you guys can
see how frustrated and I'll likely get
with this one so without further ado and
I have not this tube I have the other
thing or something else did you want to
mention so I bought this this is like
for pee people as PVC I think and a few
other plastic tubes so I figured out
this to be perfect and a few of you on
Twitter did say that it would be good if
seeing other people use this kind of
cutter before to cut tubing I did not
recommend this for ptg just take my
words the problem with this and I'll
show you right here is some b-roll when
you cut this tubing what happens is the
PTZ kind of warps because it's kind of
soft tubing in the sense that you can
actually bend it you know and kind of
contour the way you want without
actually applying heat at all and
because it's a little more structurally
sound than acrylic you can get away with
that without you know seeing splits and
spider cracks and all good stuff but the
problem is you know if you're cutting
too close to one side of the tube like
it's just right here and then you'll
definitely end up warping the corner you
may not even actually cut through it
this isn't the sharpest blade so you'll
just have a lot of kind of after cut
maintenance to take care of and it's
just not ideal so now I recommend
something else the pros know where to go
I'll link something in the description
that I think would be a good replacement
for for this right here well one last
thing before we get to the tube bin I
wanted to bring up the drain cord issue
so you guys were talking about how many
went obviously that's something you
would need for any custom motor loop you
want to flush that fluid out probably
every few months or so there are
different people who say different
things about you know time you want to
leave the fluid in the loop before
flushing it and even if I want to change
it I'm definitely going to need to have
a drain port so what I'm going to do is
just kind of add on an adapter whenever
I need to drain the loop so on top of
this red here there's actually another
opening at the G quarter fitting I could
have actually run fluid from the top
here and included that in the loop but I
didn't have much space to do that and
this reservoir is actually quite tall so
I have a
a G quarter 90 degree adapter that will
I guess be oriented toward the camera
and then I'll use this balled out here
that's kind of like my on and off switch
of sorts and I'll stick that on the end
and then whenever I want to drain the
loop I'll just kind of pull the case
down left side panel down and then I'll
let the fluid drain of course off but
rotate the case and kind of flipped
around in weird ways to get the fluid
out of the blocks and whatnot but that's
kind of inevitable I didn't want to have
you know I got 3-way splitter and
something weird just sitting in the open
of the case I wanted it to look very
close and very cohesive so I'm willing
to pay the price of setting up the drain
port after the fact rather than leading
something dorky exposed there's also a
port at the back of the reservoir that's
kind of my bad I didn't take advantage
of that earlier but it's not really
aligned with either of the grooves in
the in the back of the case anyway so
yes that's my take on that so a few
things to keep in mind especially if
you're gonna be using this heat gun
indoors this is just a cheap Wagner from
Home Depot apparently all the cool kids
use this one because it's cheap but it
gets the job done open a fricken window
and turn on the fan because this will
heat up your room especially a small
room in a matter of minutes and then
also if you can be working with really
tight bends wear some gloves only
because the pipe about an inch to two
inches away from the heat source will
still be scolding hot so you know these
are just a little rubber padded gloves
actually Electrical gloves but you could
use these to keep that immediate eat
away from your hands it will burn after
a while especially be holding it over it
for a few minutes at a time so let's get
going I recommend starting off with high
heat to get the thing going and then
turning it down to low heat especially
if you're impatient this stuff takes
quite a while to do it you'll see about
a minute to two minutes to keep the to
get the ptg malleable enough to start
bending without creating kinks and
bubbles and all that good stuff looks
something else I forgot don't forget
your silicon insert this one's slightly
smaller than the ID of the PCG tubing so
the bends aren't perfect far from that
actually but it won't impede flow by any
substantial degree if you don't bend the
tubes with any kind of insert inside the
tubing what will happen is little kink
on the inside it'll just kind of like
closed up very sharply and that's not
good for fluid flow and then also the
outside will collapse because there's
nothing to keep it from from doing that
you can already see it slightly Bennet -
they have it on high once you see that
go ahead and turn it down below here -
want this to a kind of drag out if you
rush it you'll definitely get bubbles
that's just something I've noticed
we see if I start to bend it now so to
get a small kink there see at the bottom
or whatever you want to call it it's a
ridge that you don't want on the inside
that means the inside is not hot enough
so you don't want to bend it with that
showing up and as you can see - we're
starting to get the bubbles which means
that two things happen so first off I
was trying to bend it too soon so it
definitely can't up there in the middle
and then when I try to correct it I
basically pushed it closer to the city
to the heat source you can kind of see
the bubbles showing up right in there
that is undesirable that makes this
entire tube especially that been
structurally unsound so if you see
bubbles start over and just for the heck
of it I'm going to keep holding this
over the flame just to show you you know
it can get really bad
Oh
you see this is just a liquid now I mean
I could pretty much contort this however
I want and it will just move with it so
yeah severely overheated that just you
get those huge bubbles of Pvt G and yeah
this is complete trash now yeah so I had
this whole Bend planned out and I left
the silicon tube in the entire time
tried to pull it out and the tube
snapped so I got start from scratch
again the joys of ptg bending this is
this is some lovely stuff folks you need
so much patience especially when you're
first starting out in order to get these
things just right
oh yeah I'm going to end this video on
an epic new so this tube right here
thing looks a little crazy you're
probably wondering where this is
supposed to go this is supposed to run
from the CPU up to the top 360 no
radiator this was believe they're not my
second attempt I'm actually getting
pretty good at this I was a terrible at
first I went there about four large
boxes of phtt tubing before I was able
to nail my first successful Bend but I'm
getting better at it and now granted my
friends aren't perfect you see there's
still flat spots on the top and it's
kind of jagged it's not a perfect
perfect Bend by any means but it's good
enough and though we're going to now put
it in the build so we can see the
finished product that's how I'm going to
end the video so here we go I'm going to
swing the camera around here okay so
what I was talking about it's going to
run from here up to the opening on the
backside of the top radiator and oh we
got it backwards okay so this is worth
wait no I still go back there we go
we're swinging it on in uh-huh
all right got it aligned there okay that
one's pretty much good to go and then up
top here she's just gonna oh yeah oh
yeah all right now that's a woo I tell
you what for my second attempt I I'm
going to brag a little bit that that was
one heck of a bend it took so long to do
now just so I was so I guess precise
with my bends because I didn't want it
to you know start bubbling up I didn't
wanted to kink anywhere and I really
didn't want to do it over again so I
really took my time on that one and I
really think it paid off so that right
there is is what we've got so far in
project blue sky of course the only two
bends we are waiting on the bend from
the reservoir pump to
the water blocks for the GPU that will
be in parallel
both GPS being parallel here with that
one blossom optical and then from there
to the intake see it says in there few
viewer concerned about like my
orientation you can't tell that it says
in on the inside and this is out over
here so in out and the pump will be
moving from the water will be moving
from from here up through there so those
are the two bins we're waiting on the
water block should come in sometime this
week and then that'll be it for part 4
we'll fill the thing up make sure that
we don't have any leaks and a project
blue sky will be finished but let me
know what you think about us but we've
got so far I'm honestly I'm honestly
proud of myself for that then that then
took a long time I'm glad I glad I
nailed it without having to waste like a
whole day on it this one here I might
end up redoing this one just because
it's a little skirts and imperfections
particularly down here this one I'm just
going to leave this one was a royal pain
but you know after about two or three
boxes of ptg nailed that one this one I
talked about two or three attempts and
then this one took two attempts here and
this one was by far the most challenging
in terms of you know the number of bends
in it whereas this one which is
challenging because there were so many
bends taking place in such a small space
now that's it one more big look at
project blue sky as as she is right now
and will be will be getting back at it
for port for sometime this week
I'll be uploading a few videos that
don't have to do with project blue sky
for now I sell gloves long stuff but yes
you see a motherboard review and maybe a
few other just kind of benchmarks and
whatnot and then we'll run this thing at
the port for sometime next week
this is Salazar's studio thanks for
bending with us that's a new one
