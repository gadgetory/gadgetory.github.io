I want to introduce you to the fractal
design defined see this is a midsize
case that has seven PCIe slots it's
actually not to s long I should say but
it is fairly wide and it has excellent
cable management we're going to throw a
custom loop into this chassis right here
but first it's going to spin a little
knowledge actually for those interested
in this case like I said it's
beautifully designed has excellent cable
management I think it's going to look
really good once we have all the other
components inside of a deck it looks
really good just sitting there by itself
I'm very glad the fraggles included a
basement this time around it's not as
wide not as big as the defined s but the
defined C is still a solid choice it's
also very affordable link in the video
description if you're interested so a
case review here up front you can
support up to a 360 millimetre rat up
front also a 280 mil rat of course the
respect to fan sizes up top it looks
like a 280 red or to 120 fan so a 240
rat as well and then the back support
for a single 120 millimeter fan radiator
combo whatever you want I thought this
was really cool similar to how
competitors deal with power supply
insertion right here you get two volt
power supply bracket also here the
signature fractal design cable
management system this is actually a
just popped in a little more so you have
extra cable management space in the back
so you can put that back panel on with
ease to large rubber grommet cutouts you
my 24 pin USB 3.0 SATA the works on this
side onto the back here as you can see
very clean plenty of space for all your
cables to be routed from the left side
here you have a large SSD tray up top
which is actually removable with the
simple thumb screw very nice I love this
I think all case manufacturers should
follow suit here and plenty of space
down below now it does include a
harddrive tray I took that out because
obviously will be water cooling like I
said so we're not going to need that I
actually don't use hard drives period so
we'll just put an SSD up here and that
should be it apart from that I mean it's
just a basic back panel whatever you
want to call it configuration two more
rubber grommets up top for 24 pin access
maybe some fan cables and stuff coming
through here and no no that's really
about it oh if you're worried about no
dust or anything like that you have
let's see this one here this one goes in
the front so it just clips in very
nicely and then we also have the one for
the bottom right here slides across the
entire bottom section of the case so
dust is pretty much a non-issue here if
you want to mount fans at the top you
can also remove to kind of a little
modular panels oh god I can't get that
on anyway this top part is removable and
you can replace it with the included
just dust filter up top it's magnetic so
if you want to mount fans up here that
shouldn't be a problem at all
so plans for this bill just kind of in a
nutshell involve a single 360 mil rad on
the far right I'm going to put two gtx
1080s in here in sli it's the same
config I use in blue sky check out this
video right here for more details and
then I'm also going to stuff the
beautiful design err gigabyte Zee 270x
motherboard which is a all silver
motherboard even a PCB like all of it is
completely silver I'll stop that video
right here keep pointing the videos and
videos I'm sorry but the theme of this
build is going to be silver obviously
with a hint of purple I think that
purple fluid is going to look pretty
dang to open here with silver accents
everything else for the most parts going
to be black I think I'm going to just
black these out I don't know why fractal
chooses white just PCI bracket slots
things I don't know why they do that but
we're probably gonna paint these black
maybe silver and I have some silver
paint silver metallic paint I don't know
if that's going to be overkill or not
and we'll put black fans here black fans
here with the 360 mil rad and I think
we're going to end up mounting the
reservoir up top this way I think that's
the only place that's really going to
work I also have a very special set of
cables sent over by Tony from verrilli
check out his channel linked in the
video description the dude actually is
really good at making cables he sucked
us up multiple times here in the studio
so give him a big shout out subscribed
to his channel he will greatly
appreciate it I mean just look at how
sexy these cables are so the silver is
going to match the silver PCB the
motherboard and the purple hopefully is
going to match the fluid at least close
enough you'll get the idea it's going to
be purple it looks kind of blue in the
camera but it is a very deep purple in
real life so that's it this is literally
the color scheme in the 24
then we're going to emulate that in the
rest of the build we've got a lot to do
here in part ones go ahead and get
started I hope you enjoy the tech form
now for the RAM I've chosen g.skill
Triton z RGB and ddr4 dims these are
beautiful I'll say that first off but
they are going to cost you a pretty
penny they're not cheap by any means I'm
not going to try to sugarcoat that you
will pay this is in this case here it's
a it's an 8 by 4 kit so 32 gigabytes
here this will cost you well over 100 US
dollars maybe even upwards of 200 bucks
it just depends on where you find them
at what point in time memory is pretty
expensive nowadays because people are
working on 10 nanometer processes and
just the supply of these modules is
pretty pretty slim right now so I still
recommend these if you're all about
looks and performance both are included
in these modules here so anything can
look beautiful in in this case
you
let's all take a moment to appreciate
the fact that there are billions of
transistors packed into this guy right
here that is insane it's really weird
it's as light as a potato chip there's
so much power in here just mind-blowing
all right and here we are this will be
the end of part 1 basically everything
is in here except for the tubing and
that's just you know that's a video in
itself just because uh I expect we have
some difficult bends I say that about
every custom we build we put together
but kind of a tight squeeze over here
that's for sure so the pump is just
sitting right here underneath this
opening here in the basement very nice
the fractal included that so it is a
custom loop friendly even though it is
kind of a it's in a very long case so
there is not much space between the
graphics card and both of them and the
front rat also something else want to
tackle we're going to have to put the
fans on the outside which means that our
dust filter which normally says here
will not all fit and we can't do that so
I think I'm gonna have to cut out some
maybe like dust filter screen and try to
line that around the case something I
don't know we'll come up with something
to mitigate the dust problem that will
be inevitable if we don't install the
one that comes with the case I think
what we're gonna do with the loop we're
going to start will not start here but
so we're going to connect down should be
straight up then we're going to go up
and to here now we're going to want the
reservoir to feed the pump directly so
we're gonna have to have a really long
piece of pipe probably come down here
and then somehow make its way over here
that that piece is going to be extremely
long and I'm pretty sure that we're
gonna have to redo that a couple times
and then of course we have to worry
about the radiator up here sorry it's
not focusing very well but we have two
openings up top we have to worry about
as well as we have to include the rat in
the loop
obviously that is pretty much it though
or call it quits for the day I want to
emphasize I love this case this case is
freakin awesome it just it looks
beautiful it's so friendly to build in
I'm actually you know if this was a
tempered glass of defined C I think this
would probably be my favorite case
period it's easier to build in than the
NZXT s340 elite and just regular as 340
and I think it looks better than both
the s 340 and the P 400 that's just my
personal opinion but I
can kind of conclude for yourself what
you think about this case so that's
where I'm going to end it for now this
is the end of part 1 stay tuned for part
2 I expect it will only be a two-part
series so that's that's good not going
to drag it out like we used to
this is science to do thanks for
building with us
