little crooked Jacob thanks Curtis I'll
take good care us for shout out shell
gift card so any money on this there's
not even a shell around here use it so
this is representing Jake it's probably
not I think you're supposed to put water
on top of it oh I didn't do that with
mine whoops I think it's like I don't
know maybe not I don't know any of the
right ones don't think so I think people
are gonna be watching this stupid wow
this kids way more retarded you know
what I didn't think dude like I'm like
Knight Rider you can't even see it
what the heck well do and read this on
the road really did not think this
through
like if the Sun hits it just right you
can get like there we go this is a good
angle right here yeah sponsored by
should we do Fanta first or Foxconn I
feel like we need to make a pop of fancy
fanta yeah that's orange that'll work
better oh well yeah it's gone you can't
see it at all home I know I don't even
care
oh that's a logo though yeah I'm I'm
pretty sure it'll line class I'm pretty
sure that's you're not supposed to do it
with this stuff I'm pretty sure yeah
it's like the fifth time I've done this
in my lifetime I think I know what I'm
talking about okay yeah well no what I
didn't think about the glass is kind of
wet and these are supposed to still hold
you that when we first started okay cool
thanks Curtis for sending me multiple
ones you probably knew that you're gonna
mess up do you want me to bring like a
towel out here that still doesn't work
oh just forget it you got three more of
these something like is this some Cole
like I'm like sponsored by like UFO
sightings foxconn and I'm gonna be able
to see either that's gonna look so oh
man no we need to try something
different for the Fox pond
you know what we should do no you should
do it right here we should go downwards
on it mercy JD where are you going oh my
god what you doing I got oh he's pissed
he's pissed he's on a mission I don't
know what he does over there of it how
sick with this luck
if we had Foxconn going down but we
check the f1 I'll be desolate retorted
so just okay no no no here's my idea
okay take the F off and just do F and
then ox Khan you know at this point Greg
with this visa since middle school
I told you to tear it off honestly blue
Mitchell Mitchell come back five months
what did you poor where's your wiper
blade gone yeah
it flew off on the highway and there was
$75 to fix and this is free I was at a
gas station
oh that's rehab that you use that often
like what's even worse is you can't see
the sponsored by so all you see is just
a random orange F with three circles and
an ox con we to combine both logos into
some epic Foxconn logo with a tribute to
Fanta so we're gonna put the other Fanta
logo if they just put a good one on
there now yeah I think the perfect spot
actually oh are you serious yeah now boy
when people are like looking up they're
like my look up pretty this guy is like
that that all experiences well I guess
on the window oh no no no right here
right here
hey JJ yeah that'll be JD I'm so dude
get straight the JD amber or yeah yeah
oh yeah so I want it like kind of
off-center I would like try to line it
up this you can with the contour which
one like top or side that one's bigger
never done this on a curved surface or
your saw
oh I say just smash it down yeah there
goes let's look at Matt and it I'm gonna
touch I'm gonna title this video Jacob
finally got sponsors and then like psych
you still sucks nobody wants to sponsor
him Fanta des and Foxconn de toutes the
Nats oh my dude I know my mouth I really
think it looks great just from like from
far back you can still see the logo so
when someone's like driving in front of
me look at the back it's orange this is
random actually a pretty good job at
that one that was curved - it's really
awesome you should do one on the other
side - I think either side or all issues
Foxconn like running down this like on
the window I like that way that's
actually not bad idea do on the other
side the this illegal tent
it's definitely illegal oh yeah excusing
a pair of shorts as like a tackle good
Thomas Edison invented the washer and
dryer Gregg so we'll be fine
yeah I like break the groupthink here
what about if you did it here that's why
I said on that side no I mean I'm doing
it like like I'm talking about on yeah I
know I'm gonna do it on the frame yeah I
don't care I think on the frame would
look better high or low I think higher
or without my level
yeah my brother you know it was good oh
yeah this is gonna be so offset it I can
already tell are you serious it's
crooked
oh yeah that's okay there looks like
it's gonna be so confused that looks
pretty sweet
I think it's like one of the most
annoying us on the blog this is stop
barking hey growling it will Nance no
that looks really good though I think I
think Mitchell I think the same is not
Mitchell I'm not even singing anymore
you do laughs nobody I feel like 98% of
the world has no idea what that is like
Foxconn is yeah they're gonna think it's
like Super Mario all right so I want to
do a huge shout out to Curtis McGee
thank you so much for sending me these
sponsored stickers and I think it's
awesome I think it's gonna work out
great
yeah definitely I think the resale value
just went up like a couple of thousand
dollars it look
oh yeah that means it's a Volkswagen as
you can tell like what you have on it
yeah it's been eight months if they wash
the car who did this who did this I
don't know someone in my neighborhood
probably they saw how sick it looks and
they're trying to take me down a notch
but now they can't cuz it says sponsored
by so they know it's a fish that's true
I say Oh fish because it's your own
official way but that's what people have
sponsored saying we probably shouldn't
probably save your car from further
instructions oh of course further abuse
we call it the white marshmallow because
at a hundred miles per hour it starts to
take flight and come off the ground oh
yeah oh yeah I'm surprised this car gets
to 100 miles an hour it takes about five
miles oh good that likes and then
Foxconn Foxconn here's this VIN number
if you guys want to run run a check yeah
thanks thank you bro looks great Jacob
thanks Curtis Magee thank you shoutout
I'll send you something like some things
on a while maybe a postcard of Panama
City
