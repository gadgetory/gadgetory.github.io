470 benchmarks I want it's a little film
to edit as possible just being honest
here I purchased this XFX rx 470 from
Best Buy last week for one hundred and
sixty u.s. dollars killer price for
sneaky performance it's often been
advertised as the 1080p sweet spot
graphics card but if we make a few
compromises that I personally believe
are worth making the RX 470 can be an
entry-level 1440p gaming card as well
the testbench and i7 5820k at 4.6
gigahertz on an ex Hyundai 9 Taichi from
a stock in 32 gigabytes of Trident Z
ddr4 from g.skill huge shout-out by the
way to thermaltake for this epic setup
more on that in a separate video the RX
470 here will be running its stock out
of the box additional overclocking
Headroom is minimal anyway the card will
also be sporting the latest crimson
relived drivers available on AMD's
website are you ready here we go
let's jump right in with GTA 5 first
while maintaining a high graphics preset
that's everything under the graphics tab
set to high that can possibly be set to
high with the exception of both
anti-aliasing and ambient occlusion boom
62 FPS on average 40 on the low-end
frame towns were also very consistent
and flat a few tiny spikes here in there
thanks to a slight GPU bottleneck but
overall acceptable scores something else
I do want to mention swapping the 5820k
for either a 67 or 6600 K or their cable
a counterparts with an identical
frequency will yield very similar frame
rates next up which are three very GPU
intensive and this chart shows it I
didn't want to chop into graphical
settings any more than I did at this
point just comes down to personal
preference so I set about at 56 FPS for
the average even so a 37 is still a
decent minimum what we don't want to see
something like 20 or 30 on the low-end
which would indicate a stark contrast
and compute potential for the specific
game aka a severe bottleneck in Street
terms battlefield 1 to my surprise
tolerated the mid-range Polaris GPU in
this case the 5820 case 12 threads all
12 of them are working very hard as is
the graphics card but this is a good
thing it indicates a beautiful
optimization over 60 FPS on average with
infrequent dips to the mid 40s I
thoroughly enjoy playing this game not
because I'm good because
most definitely not but because it's
always smooth no matter what I do to the
PC in question
I even down clock this exact CPU to 1.2
gigahertz and enjoyed my experience more
on that in a video right here now let's
move on to a very CPU intensive title my
favorite city skylines in this instance
frame rates were as expected if 22 seems
low it's because it is it's completely
normal though replacing the RX 470 here
with a gtx 1070 changes literally
nothing which means that our cpu is
calling the shots see this video here
for more details I love benchmarking
this game because it utilizes resources
in unique ways let's end on another good
note how about a racing game this time
around four to six apex chances are if
your computer can run Windows 10 it can
run four to six but in game graphics are
still top-notch and in the high settings
preset burning rubber around the wet Top
Gear test track 67 FPS on average 51 for
the minimum very narrow range which is
exactly what we want to see keep in mind
that these benchmarks were in 1440p all
of these benchmarks have they been in
1080p all of these settings could have
been bumped into the ultra territory
with similar fps so that's that the
clear-cut no BS cookie-cutter
benchmarking run of the AMD rx 470 if
you appreciate this quick and dirty
style format video give this one a
thumbs up give it a thumbs down if you
feel the complete opposite or you hate

already I'll catch you in the next video
