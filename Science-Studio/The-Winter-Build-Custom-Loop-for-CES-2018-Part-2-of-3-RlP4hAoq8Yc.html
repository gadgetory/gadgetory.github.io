usually very long because they have to
fit the tubing in here and the tubing's
you know those are pretty long stents so
way it's so awkwardly shaped I honestly
have no idea what's in here I just kind
of told them that I needed a bunch of
stuff and I kind of threw some parts at
them but I don't really know what I
ordered I think I ordered everything I
need but we'll find out okay this is a
CPU block I'm actually really excited to
see what this looks like here oh it's
completely sealed you gotta open it like
a chip bag I know that is a thing of
beauty check out how sexy that acrylic
block is there d5 pump that's important
what is this ooh this is a 1080 TI
founder's acrylic block too bad I don't
have a 1080i on hand actually both of
mine or I had agar made because both of
them stopped working I'll explain that
later but it's not really important for
this video we have here a dual single D
5 top upgrade kit I'm assuming this is
the reservoir now this package is a bit
weird I have to disclose this upfront so
they didn't originally have any 360 mil
rads to send they were just they were
selling like hotcakes and then they
couldn't send one for the build-up then
they found one last minute pretty thick
but I think we're gonna go with just a
single
radiator here anyway so the thicker the
better although there is a form of
diminishing returns involved with the
thickness of the rad this should be
plenty for a single CPU single GPU array
I'm excited to put this thing in this is
a silicone insert important for bending
tube this is a flow indicator that's
pretty cool so this actually has two
built-in G quarter fittings and it's
like an all acrylic package which is
pretty sweet so you can see everything
and a flowing inside there we'll
definitely implement this somewhere
these fittings are super cool you can
rotate each section of these fittings to
come fit where you need it to go it's
why they call the fitting is right
apparently I ordered a bunch of stuff
for the reservoir and pump we'll see but
more than better just in case something
doesn't work out we'll be all right
there here is our tubing again the more
the better if we can afford to make some
mistakes this isn't very much tubing but
it should be
okay I mean is it my first rodeo more
fittings these look like these are just
G quarter inner to three-quarter outer
fittings that's nice again in the deluxe
white color you can find all these parts
linked in description fidgeting and
building something similar but these
look really good alright so these are
the components we will try to throw into
the build today in this part of the
series may even get a few of the bends
finished but I want to say something in
reference to the comment that I pinned
in the last part of this series that gtx
1070 down there yeah that one there will
not be using that we will be using a
gigabyte card not a not a hall-of-fame
card they couldn't deliver one so
gigabyte is pulling through here they're
sending a gtx ten atti it's this one
that's that's what it looks like but I
think it's gonna persuade tin they're
not only because the shroud is white but
also because if you notice our attention
to detail because I didn't talk about
this in the last video team group is
sending another kit of their 16 gig
Nighthawk RGB Ram to go into these two
slots over here so we'll have white and
then a little bit of orange and actually
the car it has a bit of orange in it so
it's it's gonna work all around because
look be quiet also has a hint of orange
in their logo so super sweet how that
worked out very grateful to gigabyte for
pulling through the last minute also
means we're not gonna have to water cool
the graphics card and we'll still get to
stay relatively safe with our color
scheme so gonna work out really nice and
make things a bit less stressful on my
own because I have to shift this thing
out like in three days so we're gonna be
cramming last minute let's go ahead and
start throwing these components into the
rig real quick there's something I want
to point out I'm actually pleasantly
surprised by how tiny these fittings are
usually you want like fittings to be
images on the DL right because these are
white though they're gonna stand in with
the rest of the components in the build
this is a nice paint job here these
actually remind me of pretty much seals
Revolver fittings quite a bit
they're just considerably smaller so if
you're looking for a standard size small
fitting this one right here from bits
power and might be for you
all right well your boy feels pretty
stupid so I was going through all these
just super jank melting solutions to get
this reservoir fitted properly to the
case or to the radiator because well
there give me a lot of weight in here
and you want to make sure that it's
properly secured so I was velcroing tie
strap like zip tying like this is a
super jank I don't recommend doing this
but this is all I thought I could do
with these for the time being because
I'm really in a time crunch here but I
ended up finding this Universal mounting
kit perfect so there are little tiny
holes at the back of the radiator we can
screw through here on the narrow side
and then the wide sides amount to a 120
mil fan frame so perfect I just I can't
believe I spent like 20 minutes trying
to figure out how to get this thing to
work
so I've got a plan here this is gonna be
our drain valve and what I'm gonna do
because the radiator is mounted to the
front which is gonna make it difficult
for fluid to drain down right because
the ports on the router up top I'm
instead gonna have it run to the back
like this I'll put a small hole out in
the grille here should be nice and easy
to do
and that way you can have a tube running
up and down and we can turn the PC
basically on its side we can just rotate
it to where the back of the piece is
facing down and then all the fluid from
above should be able to drain through
this port
all right well I'm going to call it
quits for the day we'll finish up the
tubing runs in part three a few things I
want to talk about also discuss what I
have planned for where the tubes are
going to run the first thing here this
isn't actually properly mounted and
that's just because the the reservoir is
a bit longer than the distance from like
you know 120 mph and mount down here and
the 120-mile mount up here so it's
screwed up here but I'm not to use some
adhesive on the bottom shouldn't be too
big of an issue something else I want to
showcase this this little drain port
here that I have mounted to the the back
grille actually turned out pretty nice
so we're basically using tension here to
keep these things nice and tight so
they're very sturdy and all we're doing
is just screwing one fitting on one side
into the drain port on the other side
and they're just kind of holding each
other in place so again very sturdy I
love being able to manipulate the grille
in the back of the case for stuff like
this I've done graphics card mounts
vertically on this as well very very
supportive and it's nice to be able to
utilize that for things other than just
mounting graphics cards so there you go
there's something you can do if you want
to just rotate your case on its backside
and drain your PC that way you can
certainly do that now the runs this is
this is where things get complicated
alright so I've got the camera mounted
on a tripod so you see how everything's
gonna work
the pump is down here utilizing this
little cutout that has some built into
the PSU shroud for the dark base Pro 900
you can buy this v1 tech comm if you're
interested so we have an import an out
port obviously you want the pump to will
not pump to feed the retro but the
reservoir to feed the pump so we want
this lead here on the reservoir to
directly run into the intake port on the
pump that way when we fill a reservoir
up we can let it drain all the way down
and get that fluid cycling through
because you don't want your pump running
on air that's how you destroy it so
we'll have a flow meter I think right
here in between maybe we'll have it on
this side I don't know yet but we'll
have a flow meter somewhere on the
bottom just to kind of make things a
little spicier I think this looks pretty
cool by the way and then from here we're
gonna have it come out and it's going to
go into this port it's going to go from
this port probably up and over into the
CPU block and then from here we're going
to have it feed the radiator so the
radiator
the radiator runs gonna go more than
likely forward and then across and then
probably up again just a little bit and
then running into this front port and
then it's gonna drain through the
radiator and then out the back port I'm
gonna have it kind of swing around like
we did in our previous build and enter
the reservoir from the top we're not
cooling the graphics card remember
because we're getting a gigabyte card
I'll just kind of like do a little
makeshift Photoshop work here yeah
that's what it should roughly look like
and again we have these orange accents
on the RAM and the orange accents and
the be quiet fans because the be quite
logos is Port Orange so it's all gonna
work really nicely and by the way I
think for the fluid color choice we're
gonna go with orange something along
this color scheme here I think that's
really cool white and orange don't see
too many of those builds out there so
this should spice it up just a bit more
I've had a lot of fun building this case
thus far plenty of space in there to
pretty much do whatever you want so
we're gonna get creative it's not gonna
be just a run-of-the-mill custom loop
and I think that the all-white color
schemes will look really good with some
orange fluid in it just makes the orange
pop that much more if we throw some
white LEDs in there as well not too much
that we don't overkill it so stay tuned
for part 3 it will be coming with the
next day or so because I do need to ship
this PC by like the 20th to LA and from
there it will be shipped to Vegas for
CES to be featured in the be quiet suite
which is really cool and super excited
about that you like it's good to be sure
to give it a thumbs up I appreciate it
thumbs down for the obstacle to
subscribe but if you haven't already
stay tuned for more content like this
this is science studio thanks for
