what are the pros and cons of choosing
an ITX form factor for my next PC build
so if you could have a dedicated video
just to this question it is one of the
first things I think you should decide
on when you're looking to build a PC
what form factor and motherboard you
want to go with that ultimately decide
the size of your PC you can you know
build some pretty big pieces with ITX
form factors but it would look kind of
weird throwing an ITX motherboard into a
huge you know ATX case don't don't do
that
so the first pro of a mini ITX form
factor is as its name describes a small
footprint check this out it's smaller
than the span of my hand if you put it
next to an ATX motherboard it is dwarfed
and that's a good thing if you choose
something like this it's because you
want small you want portable all of
those things come in one small package
when it comes to motherboards now it
trade out to this and this applies to
most ITX boards is peripheral placement
now I'm talking about HD audio USB 3.0
things like that some of those locations
on some boards can be very inconvenient
and it'll make your cable management
look terrible so I recommend paying
close attention to where those ports are
on the ITX board before you purchase it
I had a gigabyte ITX motherboard but
it's USB 3.0 of way over here
worst placement for a USB hub period
because that cable that ugly black cable
just reach all the way across the board
look terrible went over my RAM over the
heatsink it was terrible and I would not
have purchased that board if I look
closely upfront so I recommend you do
that before jumping on an ITX board now
this board doesn't have it too bad the
only odd placement is in the case of the
HD audio port which is just above the
x16 slot typically with ATX boards all
that's below like I said but the x16
slot here is at the base that's where it
will almost always be free right for ITX
motherboards and that's because you have
your rear i/o to the left and your 24
pin Ram slots all that good stuff on the
right now another negative for ITX form
factors and this applies to most boards
is overclock ability assuming that your
chipset allows it this is the asrock
fatalities ii 270 ITX gaming motherboard
and it's overclocking potential is
decent I'm able to get my 7600 K to
about 4.7 4.8 I was able to get it to
but it it crashed in primary fire but I
could still game okay
but that's okay that's a decent
overclock but it's not what it could be
with an ATX board I've been able to get
the same processor to five five point
one gigahertz on comparable ATX Z 270
boards this one just isn't packing the
power phase delivery system that is
needed for those kinds of stable
overclocks
again though you're trading off those
kinds of things for the small form
factor and it's difficult to get rid of
that heat in a small case anyway
something else I suggest you look for in
your next I to X motherboard is built in
Wi-Fi if it doesn't have it don't buy it
that's my rule of thumb and here's why
if you're looking for a portable PC
which is usually what most people are
looking for when they decide to go with
an ITX motherboard you want to have
Wi-Fi you might not have your PC in a
most strategic place for which your
Ethernet cable can reach so if you have
Wi-Fi you can rely on that just for
simple streaming things like that
assuming your Wi-Fi capability at home
or in your office is strong enough but
if you don't have it and let's say later
on down the line you do want it how are
you going to do that unless the board
has a Wi-Fi a dedicated Wi-Fi card on
the PCB itself you can't just plug in a
Wi-Fi card into a PCI slot because the
only one you have is a 16x you can make
it work if you didn't have a graphics
card in there but then that kind of
defeats the purpose of an ITX gaming PC
so you have to weigh all these things
before making a decision with a board
like this there are many compromises
involved with ITX boards like I said up
and Wi-Fi is one that I do not recommend
you make another compromise many
manufacturers are willing to make for
their ITX boards is fan support pay
attention to how many fan hubs you have
built into your motherboard if you don't
have enough of the number of case fans
you're going to include in your build
you're going to need to buy an extended
fan hub that has six or so ports on it
that's going to cost you an extra 20 or
so bucks so if you can find one that
already has the number of fan ports that
you're willing to you know views just go
ahead and buy that one it's better than
buying a separate unit and having to run
all those cables from behind your case
this keeps things nice and tidy
now something I haven't personally run
into but I know others have experienced
it makes sense on paper is diminished
audio quality because everything is so
tightly packed into this form factor the
audio chips the different layers that
are built into those chips are
interfered with by other electrical
components on the board it's actually a
pretty complex explanation if you really
want to get down to it and it's some of
it's way beyond me you have to actually
study electricity and magnetism to
understand how audio interference works
to that extent but you will have in most
cases with a DX boards slightly reduced
audio clarity you'll have some kind of
background static in there just because
everything is so closely packed together
ATX boards obviously can fix that by
spacing that that Realtek audio chip
whatever it might be far away from other
components that are extremely loud far
away from inducers particularly so do
keep that in mind it's not something you
can just test before buying one but if
you can find something that has like you
know 5.1 7.1 support most of the time
those are going to be better than the
ones you just have the simple you know
headphone microphone and then whatever
else on top for my htpc builders out
there who are choosing ITX for their
form factor of choice that makes sense
I'm glad you are but who aren't using a
dedicated graphics card for video
support you might want to pay attention
to the type of HDMI interface you have
built in to the IPX board if it's 1.4
you're only going to get 4k at 24 fps
but if you have hdmi 2.0 and a
compatible cpu KB like is a good choice
for that then you can stream at 4k 60fps
that's that's a that's a deal-breaker
for a lot of people honestly but it's
something so subtle and so arm a deal
for a lot of manufacturers that it's
difficult to find new mic is very good
about listening all system
specifications Amazon is a bit more
finicky with that but try your best to
figure out whether it is 1.4 or 2.0 that
will make a world of difference in your
fluidity I guess and now we've come to
the last compromise by DX boards you've
probably figured it out by now if you've
been shopping around for a few days its
price and it costs more to buy an ITX
board for a few reasons the
manufacturing process is a bit more
difficult because everything is so
tightly packed look there there are as
many resistors and other things going on
the back of this board as there are on
the front of the board that's because
space is so limited on a board this
small but with that said if you can find
one for anywhere between 20 to 40 bucks
more than its ATX counterpart you're
getting a good deal on the board I don't
recommend spending
200 bucks on a 90 X board unless you
really need whatever it is that board
offers that others don't most of the
time 100 to 140 bucks is a good price
for a motherboard from Intel that has an
unlocked chipset right now we're still
waiting on a m4 if that happens sometime
soon
we're waiting for those ITX board this
for now for Intel at least because you
can buy Intel ITX boards currently try
to find one around 100 140 bucks you'll
be good to go there if you have any
additional questions about ITX boards be
sure leave those in the comments below
myself or someone else can help you out
I try to read as many comments as I can
initially after uploading every video
because you know I'm just trying to do
you guys a solid for being so quick to
watch the video it's my way of saying
thank you there if you liked the video
be sure to give it a thumbs up thumbs
down for the opposite be sure to click
the subscribe button if you haven't
already I will catch you in the next
video where I review a 1080 Ti in a very
unorthodox way this is Salazar studio
thanks for learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
