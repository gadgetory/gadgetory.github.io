purchased my i7 4790k I received a stock
heatsink that included a copper slug
which was quite nice to see especially
considering the fact that copper is much
more expensive per pound than aluminum
is here in the States but I looked a
little further in this matter because I
didn't recall seeing copper slugs in
some of the other stock heats things
that I'd seen from Intel based CPUs and
so when I did my research it was
literally just as simple as opening one
of the multiple boxes of old processors
that I have back there I found that most
of your skylake processors don't include
copper slugs what's going on there now
this was a bit confusing at first
because even my i5 4460 from the Haswell
lineup included a heatsink with a copper
slug so these copper slugs aren't just
biased towards unlocked K CPUs even my
locked 4460 included one but every
skylake process that i have purchased
comes with one of these cheaper all
aluminum heat sinks that's a little
strange I know that skylight TDPS are a
bit lower than has wells but I mean did
that really mean having to cut back
altogether on the quality of stock heat
sinks so that's the question I want
answered in this video if you are on a
very strict budget and have to use a
stock CPU cooler should you up for a CPU
that includes one of these with a nice
copper slug in the middle or just settle
for the cheaper flimsier all aluminum
one let's find out so here's what went
down here in the studio after
reassembling each stock heatsink with
its respective fan even though both fans
were nearly identical i mounted each
atop my 6600 k which i had down clocked
to 4 gigahertz at one point to 5 volts
to use as a baseline as we're assuming a
very strict budget the pre applied
thermal paste on both units were
utilized once each cooling device was
secured and wired in
I fired up the machine and ran through a
series of tests involving I 264 Adobe
Premiere GTA 5 black ops 3 and minecraft
just you know for kicks
I used MSI Afterburner for the most part
to record the peak temperature
of the cpu as it underwent each test and
recorded the results in an Excel
spreadsheet I then repeated the exact
same test after installing the second
stock cooler the solely aluminum one and
yes that meant taking the entire tower
back to the workbench removing the old
thermal paste reinserting and rewiring
the new cooler finally now these results
are actually rather interesting let's
see how things went down
you
I have to confess something upfront here
when I handle both of these CPU coolers
I notice that the skylight cooler was
much lighter than it has well cooler and
you're thinking well Greg dummy copper
weighs more than aluminum so that makes
sense the one with the copper slug would
weigh more if they're both the same
everywhere else but I also noticed the
skylake aluminum fins or thinner than
the ones on haswell's haswell's cooler
and that's a little concerning to me it
seems like they're cheeping out all
around on their new coolers
now obviously the 6600 K and the 6700 K
do not come with coolers this Intel
encourages you to use custom cooling in
order to achieve fairly high overclocks
with those overclockable CPUs but when
it comes to their non K CPUs like the
6400 that I have here you're gonna
you're gonna have a pretty cheap cooler
actually cheaper than the has well based
coolers it has well equivalents i
recieved a cooler with a copper slug
here in the 44 60 even though this one
is not overclockable so for some reason
Intel is just seeping out big-time I
know why they're saving money so this is
a bit disappointing because Intel
assumes that you're going to be using
the stock coolers for both of these CPUs
in fact I wouldn't even recommend using
a custom cooler on either of these
because neither of them are going to get
very hot even under full load so with
that in mind it is a bit disappointing
to see that the newer platform is using
a much cheaper cooler that will yield
higher temperatures as you've just seen
and the tests that I ran in this video
so with that in mind skylights still
worth it now I know it seems like I've
been bashing sky like a lot lately you
know that the improvements from Haswell
aren't substantial but in the case of
the 6400 versity 4460 in particular both
of which include intel coolers is it
worth purchasing a newer CPU if you're
going to if you're going to have I guess
a cheaper cooler is what I'm trying to
ask here because if you're going to
purchase both of these coolers I'm
assuming you're on a budget anyway and
you're probably not going to want to
spend more than twenty or thirty dollars
on a custom CPU cooler so you probably
just settle for the stock coolers it's
just a bit disappointing to me to see
that the new
decline up is using cheaper coolers from
Intel and I don't know if many people
have been pointed this out I haven't
seen much in regards to the cooler
change they look exactly the same from
the top with the fans on but underneath
is a completely different story so with
the extra temperature savings involved
with Haswell CPUs should you forgo the
6,400 and take advantage of the 44 60 go
ahead and check out this video here
where I compare the i5 4460 to the i-5
6400 I also take into account the fact
that one uses ddr3 and the other use of
ddr4 and there still isn't much of a
difference at all in any task the i5
6400 does improve a bit on video
rendering and things of that sort but
for gaming there they're pretty much
going to be equal for the most part when
it comes to gaming so if you are a gamer
and you're considering either the CPUs
and you want to have a cooler system I
personally would recommend the 44 60
even though you're not going to have the
newest and greatest it's gonna play
games just fine and it will keep your
entire computer a bit cooler at least
that's what I was able to conclude from
the test that I was able to run in the
studio but I want to hear from you let
me know in the comments if this is a big
deal or not obviously if you're using a
custom cooler this probably doesn't even
apply to you at all so thank you for
watching this far into the video but if
you are using a stock cooler I want to
hear from you especially let me know if
knowing the fact that Haswell CPU
coolers do have copper slugs would have
been a game changer for you would you
have considered Haswell a bit more than
you had up front if you were choosing
between something like the i-5 6400 and
the i5 4460
if you liked the video and you like what
we did and the content that you saw be
sure to give us a thumbs up if you
didn't for whatever reason give us a
thumbs down and let me know in the
comments below why you gave us a thumbs
down be sure to subscribe if you haven't
already because we do cool tests and
things like this pretty much all the
time
this is science studio thanks for
learning with this</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
