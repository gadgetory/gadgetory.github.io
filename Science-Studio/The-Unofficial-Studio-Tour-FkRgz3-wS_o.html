studio I'm gonna go ahead and give you a
studio tour because you all have been
asking about that now I should disclose
this is not my typical location for
where I film I am here back home over
the summer I'm a full time college
student I have one more year to go and
so this is my last summer being home in
Florida but when I go back to my dorm in
Louisiana I'll give you guys another
tour of that studio because that's the
one that you'll be seeing most of these
videos filmed in now on but for now I'll
go ahead and just show you kind of what
goes on this is actually my bedroom I
grew up in this room my bed's right
there I don't show it because it's not
the point of these videos but I will
show you all of that I have nothing to
hide
let's go ahead and just pick up the
camera and start walking through all the
goodies in this room let's go okay folks
studio tour I guess we'll go and start
with what's above what you see normally
in the videos these are all the
processors I've ever owned with the
exception of my very first processor it
was an i3 4150 in case you're wondering
and that was the first CPU for the first
PC I ever built in my life which is
actually only about is about seven
months ago I think as of the recording
date to this video pretty much all Intel
and I'm sure you've seen all of these if
you've been following my channel and the
videos I have and I have two AMD
processors right here this one's the
8300 and this one is the 6300 apart from
that really nothing else that I hear in
my mouth but really nothing else
entertaining up here just have some
trophies that's pretty much it there's
trophies behind all those as well
I just I played a lot of sports not a
generation so I I have all those on the
shelf to the right of that like and some
other plaques and stuff I have the
Marshall stack if you've you been asking
about this I go ahead and give you just
a quick close-up here of some of the
settings this is a DSL 100 JCM 2000 the
TS l stands for triple super lead and
that's that's her folks that is a
full-on marshall cabinets stack on from
that nightstand not important at all
although I would like to give a shout
out to my favorite band ever Breaking
Benjamin I got to meet them in person
that's me whoops
me right there and my brother right
there and all the all the band members
it was a great concert and it was
awesome to meet them in person I would
love to do it again see them again
that's my bed
nothing special but yes that is where it
is so literally right beside where I
typically film boom that's where I sleep
I do have that's the lens cap for my
camera I'm currently using this is my D
5100 I used to film with this all the
time if you've watched any video in the
past six months this is what I used
it's a d50 100 and it's not the southern
I don't know it's not the best camera
like I said 1080p 30 P I said this on
the tgw I was on this week the screen is
full of fold-out screen that's that's
what I liked about this camera and
that's what the FC 1000 is as well which
is what I'm using currently to film with
nothing special
I can't just a bit but you guys wanted
to see all of this now let's move a
little further over into the yeah the
hardware corner tons of boxes and to be
honest about half of these are still
packed with things I've never even
opened before now let's start with some
of these things from deep cool they sent
me down here we've got this is a modular
power supply yep from deep cool and two
of their TF 120s these things are fluid
ball bearings oh yeah fluid dynamic
bearing these are some beast mode fans
and I haven't even put them in any
computer yet they're just kind of
showing a bunch of other boxes a few we
were asking for what type of monitor I
use here is the actual I'll turn this
way and that is the actual model number
of my ultra wide lg monitor it's a 29
inch IPS display of course in the 21 by
nine format
it's a beautiful monitor it really is
that's that's what you're always seeing
folks that thing right there I love it
actually this box right here is another
monitor that I got actually just came in
today it's so 1440p 144 Hertz but I am
still probably going to be using the
ultra web because ultra wide is my
opinion are better for content creation
so I might use this one just a game with
and then I use the ultra wide for
editing and all that
it's the other boxes here got a Corsair
h9t down there a couple solid state
drives Ram more round that's my current
round using Gale super loose case you're
wondering I don't say that and a couple
videos I said that but that's that's
what I'm using
so that glowing Ram over there the zoom
in yeah that stuff right there some good
looking around folks you can find Ram
with LEDs on them and you know great
frequencies and low castle agencies go
with that stuff if you want the flashy
stuff an ultra-wide lens from a key
that'll fit on to any smartphone see
some camera gear it's a shotgun mic I'm
not using it currently because I'm just
lazy 750 watt bronze I'm using that
currently in that rig to 960s for some
reason I still have these let's see m5
897 this isn't a 970 FX motherboard and
so I don't even know if FX but it's a
970 motherboard here's a 990 FX a gtx
980ti goal edition from MSI I still use
that one although I painted it white
this is the fatality asrock xeon
overclocking motherboard so if you have
a Xeon e3 processor from the skylake
lineup you can overclock it using this
motherboard from asrock that's a very
very convenient motherboard if you
happen to own a Xeon processor in the e3
skylake family that's a that's an empty
box this is just for storage a lot of
this stuff it's not a computer and it
says it is this down here I'm not gonna
bother pulling it out because I'm gonna
I'm gonna save it for its own video but
this is a clip contect 5.0 surround
sound system these clip speakers are
some of the best clear speakers I've
ever had I'm not and I'm an audiophile
on I'm telling you these speakers are so
crystal clear it's just it's it's beyond
amazing and underneath that I have a
pulk audio 10-inch sub and then my
Pioneer receiver VSK I don't remember
some kind of receiver it's a 725 while
receiver that's my surround sound system
again I will deal to that in another
video
AMD Black Edition that actually is this
right here it's not in its box the
Corsair 400 C is actually right here
chillin I haven't done anything with it
since I removed my computer from from
that case and put it into that one
let's see entities that's what I'm using
currently that's the computer I reviewed
you can check that out in the card right
here click on that thing if you want to
watch that video some tripod stuff more
accessories this stuff is pretty cool
actually this is worth mentioning this
is static guard if you have an
especially acrylic screen which tends to
be super staticky and attract a lot of
dust and hair you can actually spray
this on both sides of that acrylic and
prevent well for the most part a lot of
that dust and hair from sticking to your
acrylic window and your computer it's
actually it's actually worth for me to
have used it on the Corsair 400 CI I
thought about making a separate video
about that again it's just something
that you just you just spray on and then
it does its job so yeah maybe maybe I
should have done a video on that but
that just in case you're wondering that
stuff does work and it doesn't scratch
doesn't scratch your acrylic side
windows in case you're wondering I know
that stuff is super sensitive I have a
Kraken x60 up here and a behind that
another Kraken x61
let's see hey how's from getting some
fans a lot of LED RGB strips from deep
cool I've been using deep cool a lot
lately
anything else I'm forgetting I don't
dink show so let's pivot to the right
just pictures that graduated high school
that's my dad and I soccer team
Mia graduation was three and a half
years ago this is the again AMD $350 PC
build the stuff is still inside there
all that if you've seen that video if
not you can go check it out right here
it's not that not that interesting just
an old PC trying to run new hardware a
old old cartridge AMD Athlon processor
that was also featured in another video
and then a GoPro and then what's this OH
Gibson Les Paul this is one of the
nicest Gibson Les Paul's the customs
right here folks this is a cherry red
custom Les Paul it is not cheap by any
means I have
this one I have a black custom I have a
Gibson SG and I have two Fender strats
and those are all in different rooms but
this is one I like to play the most it
just sounds the best to me humbucker
pickups case you're wondering beautiful
sound especially when hooked up to that
monster right there in case you're
wondering this is a standard cheap
tripod that I use to hold the camera
where it is so you see I just said it I
said it right right there that's how you
that's how you seem up on that and then
biting so a lot if you probably think I
use an LED panel but no that is not the
case I have an incandescent lamp well
it's a stand up lamp with one extended
arm but have two now one right there on
top so it's just that's it that's just
it's just those two and boom shining
that way and I use white balance auto
correction within the camera to make
sure that doesn't look to oranjee
because that just gets annoying and
makes the quality of the picture
diminished to a great extent but that is
really it folks again I'll do one more
big sweep that's it that's my room
nothing special at all those are my boss
pedals I mentioned those but that's what
goes in the pedal board case you're
wondering there there's a little
subwoofer back there I do use a 5.1
surround system from Dell I don't know
the model name of this kit I was
actually given to me but it fits
perfectly underneath my monitor and
that's that's how I like it
so it's chilling there I got the first
two I didn't put up the back the back to
because I mean where am I going to put
them you know I go way over there and
right here is I don't want those cables
run in front of the door they look weird
and that's really about it that's what
you're looking at nothing fancy
not at all but at least you know kind of
where I'm where I'm filming currently
what this all looks like behind the
scenes I would say I would say thanks
for learning with this but you didn't
really learn much in terms of science
and that's what this channel is about so
I will just say this is science to do
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
