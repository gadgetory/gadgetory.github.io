roaming purchased adult ten years ago
where was the summer of 2014 when I was
first deceived
you know starting on Saturday I had some
cash in my pocket and I wanted to buy a
prebuilt aiming computer I found a few
that had really nice pictures and the
seller said that he could run any game
in 4k Mac settings
little did I know that a 750ti wasn't
gonna cut it upon further investigation
I discovered that CPU was like eight
years old the whole platform would need
to be in place if I wanted to be better
this wall mind you happened after I had
already given the seller the cash so I
was stuck with an old system that needed
a complete overhaul just a heads up for
anybody I was looking on Craigslist for
any PC don't spend a thousand US dollars
on orbit with an FX 8310 ativy TI
and eight gigs of ram no matter what the
seller that was new it won't it won't
come close to playing GTA 5 in 4k
there's just there's no way I got like
15 FPS so in this video we've got a few
craigslist ads to churn through as well
as a single face book marketplace ad and
that one is that was juicy that was sent
to me by a viewer on twitter so I
appreciate all of the messages you guys
have been sending on facebook Messenger
as well as Twitter and elsewhere
regarding crazy outrageous craigslist
ads you guys are awesome I know you guys
like this series that's why it's still
around I hope you enjoy this one
gigabytes Z 390 horas pro packs the
necessities and more fear next night gen
Intel rig boasting a properly doubled
12+1 phase power solution stylish
aesthetic with built-in backplate dual
BIOS 8 fan hubs the list goes on
click the link below to learn more
upgraded gaming PC $800 and looking at
the outside of this one I have a
sneaking suspicion this one's not gonna
not gonna hit that $800 mark unless they
put something like an RT X 26 2 or 70 in
here we've got AI 540 460 that was that
was a decent like 3 or 4 years ago I
mean that was like a affordable
quad-core but nowadays especially at the
low frequency and only 4 cores 4 threads
just not gonna cut it for a lot of what
you're gonna be doing today you don't
even have a dedicated graphic like
there's no discrete graphics oh yeah he
upgraded the power supply that's cool
medium Tower ok yeah but it looks like
was from 2010 and I wouldn't pay a dime
over oh gosh for this right here it
doesn't even come with a with an SSD
comes with a hard drive 200 bucks if
that
I mean this is like four times what he
should be even starting at for an asking
price
yeah it's just not there for me alright
we've got another i5 rig here this one
asking price is 995 16 gigs of DDR 4 get
an h2 70 motherboard that's perfectly
fine with an i-5 6400 got a gtx 1066 gig
in here and a 40 gig SSD plus a 2
terabyte hard drive that's pretty much
everything you need to know about this
system but when you look at the price
here you might have to top your head
maybe a year or two ago that would have
been an ok deal but a thousand bucks
today gets you a lot more than this and
I'll show you right now you know it's
even worse is like you can't even get an
i-5 6400 for anything close to what the
90 400 F is going for and the 90 400 F
is a better processor for one because
it's got two extra cores tacked on to it
I'm pretty sure that the base frequency
is higher as well and the boost might
also be high I'm gonna do this guy a
favor and it's gonna hurt him at the
same time because it just makes no sense
to buy that when you can buy a knife 400
F so we're gonna throw that one in there
look at that 150 it's an outlet PC right
now he's using the stock cooler I
believe yeah so that's fine then I
formed it also comes with a stock low
actually it's show
right here so I know it comes with a
stock cooler so I'm gonna choose the B
360 gaming Arctic from MSI here
obviously not gonna be the same as he's
using because this is an older platform
but 120 for pucks is pretty expensive
for the board with this kind of power
delivery spec I have almost I think I
have this exact board also there's
compatibility warming warning here and
that's because of the BIOS issue so when
you buy this board you're probably gonna
have to have an older Intel chip in here
that's compatible with the chipset
straight up out of the box so that you
can update your bios to the latest
revision that will allow you to run 9
series Intel CPUs that's why it's saying
that we're just doing this
hypothetically so I'm not too concerned
about it next up we've got the RAM and
let's see it's got 16 gigs of lpx at
2400 and we'll give them 16 gigs of lpx
at 3,000 how's that and that's what 75
bucks pretty good deal and it's ddr
force coming down in price a lot lately
so what is our grand total 800 bucks
so I just built a considerably better
system than this guy on PC for picker
for $200 less than his asking price
that's when you know you're asking way
too much for your old and outdated
system alright and the last one on
Craigslist this is an 8 core gaming
computer heavy duty $699 you know this
is like a business when they pitch it at
$6.99 like this is just marketing 101
here $6.99 looks a lot better than 700
even recently purchased a custom gaming
computer however I am deciding to sell
it because I need something I can use to
work on the go I used it for about six
months to edit some 4k video from my
production company worked like a charm
never any lag skip or any sort of
performance issues whatsoever and look I
see this logo right here and I'm
thinking to myself this guy's full of
crap so what it has inside first off
generic pictures like these these pissed
me off I really hate it when people
don't actually take the time to post
their own pictures to their ad like this
is this is just annoying me gtx 1050
it's pretty mediocre for a 7 or dollar
PC FX 8300
garbage no one cares about this like non
domestic product no I really needed to
know that custom bundle no DVD CD Drive
no graphics processing type dedicated
graphics but obviously you got a GTX
1050 listed on the second line
something that is worth listing is the
operating system you have Windows 10
installed and it's fully activated with
this certificate of authenticity that
that's that's good memory 16 gigs
there's literally no indication here of
what kind of Ram it is obviously the
ddr3 but what kind of ddr3 what speed no
in what configuration I have no idea
asking $6.99 great deal for a PC of this
magnitude it'll be your best friend for
years to come I have a feeling if you
know anything about pcs you're gonna end
up hating this thing this way especially
if you plan to game around 1440p with it
her to 4k video editing this is so
misleading like only ps4 800 bucks total
I can throw in a 32 inch flat-screen TV
so he's gonna charge you another hundred
bucks for a 32 inch TV that I'm sure is
crap because he didn't bother list in
the maker model that means you're better
off buying a monitor for around 200
maybe even 100 bucks $100 monitor is
probably gonna serve you better in the
long run than whatever 32 inch TV he's
gonna throw into this this is our
Facebook marketplace ad and we've we've
got we've got a few problems with it
this is $1100 custom built gaming / work
PC and we've got let's see brand new
everything you need to start gaming
modeling working computer is very fast
build list
9400 f what do you know we just we just
talked about that one right and then a
thermal takes more RGB 500 watt power
supply Z 390 or you okay you through Z
through my guess you had really no
choice
you'd have to update your bias with an
older Intel chip if you wanted to use
this with anything else so I'm not
really gonna talk you there yeah that's
fine 32 gigs of DDR 4 ok that's not that
512 SSD cool Coolermaster r2 12 LED CB
cooler
thermaltake V 200 tempered glass tower
and then Intel UHD 630 graphics big red
flag with this one
it's an
9400 f if you look at this I have the
Box conveniently I'm sitting right there
on the shelf you're probably gonna see
us on the camera it says discrete
graphics required that means you need a
graphics card a separate graphics card
okay in your system to get picture on
your display because there is no IGP in
this cpu that's why it's an F skew the
9400 has UHD graphics and 9400 F does
not so this is super misleading and
anyone who just kind of roams freely and
has no idea what they're looking at my
look at this and say oh yeah it says
it's a since it's a very fast PC
9400 F they'll go and google it and
it'll say 6 cores 6 threads 3.9
gigahertz and let me like yeah this
seems good enough for me and it's not
too expensive only yeah it is $1100 is
really expensive for the system you
don't even get a discrete card and on
top of that you get a misleading like
just statement it's just straight up lie
I think I mean there's no UHD 630
graphics in here
so you'll buy this PC hook it up to your
monitor and find out that you get no
picture at all Oh some of these making
my blood boil oh that last one let me
tell you that the toughest part about
that one is I'm not sure whether or not
the seller is lying if they're
intentionally deceiving you acting like
you can power up the system and run it
let me maybe you can and maybe the the
lie is the the skew of the chip maybe
it's not a ninety 400 F maybe it's just
a ninety four hundred in which case yeah
you HD Graphics is gonna be present but
if it's an F skew and then the purpose
of an F is so that you know it doesn't
have integrated graphics which means you
will need a discrete card to get any
picture to your monitor
so I wonder if the seller knows that if
he or she does then that would mean that
they're intentionally lying even if they
don't know and they just they just said
it thinking that was the case that's
still a lie intentional or not ignorance
of the law doesn't mean that you're
excused from it right if you're going
fifty five and forty five and a police
officer pulls you over and you tell him
that you thought it was fifty five it
doesn't mean you're not gonna get a
ticket you were still speeding this
isn't breaking the law per se but you
could certainly be sued over something
like this trust me I speak from
experience
people can sue you for
anything and it will drag out in court
and it will cost you a lot of money
especially if you see counsel which is
the wise thing to do but it's not always
the most financially responsible thing
to do so with that let me know in the
comments below which one you thought was
the worst of the ads showcased here and
also be sure to link me whether it be in
the comments or on Facebook or Twitter
you're crazy craigslist ads you guys
find online it might be featured in a
future video i try to give credit where
it to do but I get honestly so like
backed up with all the links and I'm
sent and a lot of times what I'll do is
I'll just pop up online I'll pick a
random location and I'll just search
through the classifieds at that
particularly I think a lot of them once
we did today with we're in Houston
Houston Texas it's just a random thing I
just click one I'm not targeting any
specific state or city although the
bigger cities tend to be well I guess it
could go both ways it could be more
competitive right so the prices could be
better or it could be a lot worse
because there's a lot of people doing
the same thing and they all just decide
yeah we're just gonna charge outrageous
sums of cash because if there are more
people in a city there's probably more
idiots willing to pay a lot of money so
I could I guess you could argue that
both ways anyway leave a comment down
below click that like button and you'll
like this video click the red subscribe
button if you want to stay I guess in
the loop because we do a lot of cool
stuff here in this channel and I
appreciate all of that support just the
viewership alone does help out a lot you
guys are awesome thanks for watching and
thanks for learning with us
