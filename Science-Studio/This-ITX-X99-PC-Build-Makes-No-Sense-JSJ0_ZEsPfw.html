I don't recommend any of you build there
are a few reasons why we'll discuss
those here shortly it's an ITX x99 PC
yes that is possible there is a single
as far as I know x99 ITX motherboard you
may have seen it online as old video
it's from asrock and it's rather
weird-looking you're looking at it right
now I actually painted the motherboard
white the heatsink the vrn heatsink just
because I wanted to match the other
components in the system even though
really we'll be able to see much of that
in the fragile no 202 when it's all
assembled the CPU socket alone consumes
half of this motherboards total area
it's definitely a feat I congratulate
asrock for being able to pull it off but
I can see why other motherboard
manufacturers didn't follow suit they
didn't see the point and I know as arc
doesn't want to hear this but it's the
truth there's a reason why you shouldn't
build what I'm about to show you
especially in a small form-factor case
like this what x99 cpu is bring to the
table those qualities and traits do not
line up with what ITX pcs are intended
for here are two reasons why and they
kind of go hand in hand the first is
that anyone looking to build an ITX PC
should already know that a single
graphics card only one can be used with
any modern ITX motherboard because those
boards only offers single x16 slots
which to insert a graphics card so right
there you're limited to one only film
reason 2 and this is this falls into the
x99 category if you're looking to build
that kind of PC chances are you may be
some point down the line want to SLI or
crossfire two graphics cards and if that
doesn't apply to you then maybe you just
want to overclock this thing and that's
super hard to do in a small form-factor
build like the one you're about to see
so that's my disclaimer upfront this
build makes no sense
please please please do not copy this
build part 4 part you'll see why at the
end of this video you'll be slightly
disappointed with the results you could
actually build something that is
slightly more powerful for a few bucks
less and talk about that at the end as
well but that said I hope you enjoy this
ridiculously nonsensical build
Oh
Oh
so a few things I do want to mention the
first is that the cool you're looking at
right now is the cooler that comes with
the ITX motherboard from asrock and they
design a cooler in this way because the
socket itself is not a typical 2011 v3
socket it's not a square socket it's
actually rectangular that's because they
had to fit so many things onto such a
small PCB so you can tell the RAM slots
are right next to the socket and there's
a ton of different components to the
right of it and above it and behind it I
mean that the socket is huge so they had
to design a cooler that could fit a
custom if you will 2011 v3 socket and
that was actually too tall for the node
- of - it just caused the case the bolt
and I couldn't secure it on the corners
so I had to remove that and use a stock
Intel cooler from a Haswell CPU now this
right off the bat is obviously a worst
case scenario when it comes to CPU
coolers and it's not like this cooler
was even designed for the CPU the CTO is
a much higher TDP than what this cooler
was thermally designed for so I didn't
overclock the CPU because of that and
also something else that's really
sketchy I couldn't mount the the cooler
right I mean there's there's no way to
do that because this is going to square
socket so I had to basically break off
the clips on the cooler and then just
smoosh it down as hard as I could on top
of some thermal paste over the CPU and
just kind of hold it there and then -
you burn in tests let that kind of let
that thermal paste set in and just hold
that cooler there it sounds really
sketchy and on paper you probably
wouldn't think it worked well but our
idle temperatures weren't bad high 20s
at idle and then under load with
Cinebench r15 low 70s so expected to be
a bit higher under i-264 maybe 80s but
I'm not going to be doing any rendering
or anything like that on this PC
something else that had me doubting this
coolers ability to cool the CPU is that
I had to orient it in such a way that it
was not directly on top of the CPU diet
was slightly offset from the heat spread
on top of the CPU and I wasn't sure if
that contact was going to be good
to keep temperatures down under load but
I mean as you're seeing right here our
temperatures were actually okay this is
running its stock this sucks
not cool to run an x 99 CPU at stock but
it's the best we can do given the
components that we have now a
consequence of that tying into a price
to performance ratio is the fact that I
could build them z170 ITX PC in the same
case with a 6700 K and overclock to
probably 4 point 4 gigahertz and be safe
with temps four point five I would say
it'd be the highest I'd go with
something like a cry or a c7 not with a
stock cooler temps would be probably in
the mid to upper 90s with a stock cooler
at a 67 under K you've had to be at one
point three five ish volts
four point six gigahertz yeah I would
try that four point four let's just say
four point four you're going to get at
least the same CB score in Cinebench as
the 5820k is at stock with two
additional cores and four extra threads
also consider that you could buy a
comparable z170 ITX motherboard for
about a hundred bucks less than this
four here which means that you could
throw the hundred bucks into something
else something better for that PC or
just pocket it that's my favorite thing
to do just pocket the money nevertheless
moral of the story is do not build this
PC I do hope you enjoyed watching me
build it though I'm going to be honest
with you I'm just going to disassemble
it after I finish editing this video I
might try VR with it just to see how
well it does being that it's as small
form-factor ability can just throw it in
your living room and use that as like a
you know decent PC to play games with on
your TV but it's it's not practical not
when you could build something on a z170
AC 270 platform for much cheaper that'll
still be just as powerful if not more
powerful you need a decent overclock out
of it so 250 a 20k is going to go back
to my test bench where it belongs we're
all six of its course and all 12 of its
threads will be utilized much more
efficiently if you liked this video be
sure to give it a thumbs up give it a
thumbs down if you feel like we'd
officer if you hate everything about
life be strictly to subscribe and if you
have already stay tuned for a head to
head to head to head comparison between
for monolith coolers I showed them all
on Twitter follow me on Twitter for more
details
this is sounds our studio thanks for
learning with us
