playing modern games at a modest
resolution with a single core a single
powerful core ad that is it possible I
put my i7 6700 K through the wringer
today disabling three of its four
physical cores and hyper-threading to
simulate a single core processor cache
and frequency remained unchanged for the
sake of isolating a single variable here
and that's core account this is part 1
of 4 where we simulate single core
gaming experience you'll you'll enjoy
this one
my first up I want to thank my brother
Kyle for filming today he is a he's an
amateur folk so give him giving a little
bit of leeway in the comments but a kind
say hi say hello everybody oh what's up
everybody its Kyle he sounds like he
just woke up even though it's like 3 in
the afternoon
anyway we're gonna run a few experiments
here involving CPU cores so we know that
most games out today either take
advantage of two cores fully or four
cords fully so what I want to do now is
disable cores and disable hyper
threading manually within my BIOS and
I'm running a core i7 5700 K here and
we're going to see how games scale per
core so you can see here we have one two
three and then of course all which is
for this but it's for physical cores on
this i7 here so we're gonna enable one
and of course we have hyper threading
disabled this is going to be very
interesting I wonder if we're going to
see some some just immediate performance
cuts just running the operating system
up front so one active core no hyper
threading or running at a frequency of
4.4 gigahertz so a base clock frequency
of 100 megahertz and a multiplier 44 so
that's it and we'll double check make
sure hyper threading disabled active
processor cores one so we're gonna run a
single core processor folks and
environment
with that so you can see cago and zoom
in right here clocks core zero and
that's it there's only one so this is a
single core processor right now running
at 4.4 gigahertz and we're about to run
some benchmarks see some games might
open I don't even know if some of these
games will open up running on one core
so these are all of our settings this is
the same typical Mac settings - NSAA and
GTA v everything looks good and we don't
have any advanced graphics settings
activated so yeah let's go ahead and run
the benchmarks um okay so our benchmark
is acting super super strange what is
good what is going on what is that what
is it doing there is this part of the
benchmark no no it's not
wow I have no clue what's going on right
now look at that look there's just like
things floating in mid-air the buildings
are gone what is he doing what is he
doing you guys are seeing this firsthand
this is not a you can't just fake this I
mean this is the benchmark right
obviously then you know the benchmark
FPS meter down there oh now things are
starting to slowly work their way into
the picture here I don't really know if
anything's gonna change I'll get you in
the time itself out cuz right now
there's a jet in the middle of the road
but hey we're getting decent frame rates
so yeah there's that okay so nothing's
changing I think the benchmark is broken
on behalf of our single core trying to
run this game so we're gonna call this
one did not finish I think that's the
way take all that's fair did not finish
yeah yeah didn't didn't finish okay so
next up is city skylines hopefully this
one doesn't experience any weird
I don't know bleaching out like GTA 5
did now I'm going to bump the resolution
up to max I'm gonna keep vsync off you
know this is all maxed out just like it
always is the only thing I had different
was the resolution because of what I was
doing
this bit now we're going to fullscreen
it and yet let me keep that okay so
we're going to load the load Santos map
in GTA 5 as always for the sake of
consistency and let's see let's see what
we get I think it should be okay I don't
think we're going to get very high frame
rates but I don't think we should see
artifacting like we did GTA 5 come on
now come on
keep keep on moving around the server
there we go yeah these these spring
magic table so now we're going to zoom
all the way in which is when the CPU is
stressed the most and it's oh look up
top there we're getting about seven
frames a second six seven frames a
second yeah this is it folks
look at that much play many frames
you're gonna play city skylines on a
single core stay is zoomed out as far as
possible so I can't even benchmark this
game for some reason it's the fraps
isn't working and I think that has to do
with the fact we're only running a
single core here so I can't physically
benchmark these so I'm not going to have
I don't know they're not gonna be the
most accurate framerate graphs that
you're about to see but at least you can
get an idea what we're roughly getting
up there in the top left around 20
frames per second when zoomed far out
and then it just goes into the crapper
when you zoom in I mean we're talking
below 10 FPS okay so Ash's the
singularity isn't really doing anything
one well zero frames a second you see
where every now and then we're switching
frames but it quoits 2-0 frames per
second which is obviously not playable I
would just say that this one isn't even
willing to to start you can't even open
this game with a single core running it
took about 10 to 12 minutes for the
Tyrrhenian core loading screen to
initialize and you can see we're getting
yeah way less than one frame a second
it's actually coming out to about well
20 seconds per frame so it's not even
FPS it's SPF seconds per frame this is
not a yeah this is not not cool and the
final result for Ashes 0.1 FPS the board
I don't think the FPS counter
you lower than this within the game this
has got to be some of the worst in-game
performance I have ever seen
you know what I'm actually pleasantly
surprised by total war warhammers
performance here so we're achieving
according to fraps and the game about 60
to 70 FPS but you can tell it's very
glitchy it's very is it's its abruptly
stopping and starting again and that's
the result of obviously having only one
core working but for a game that is very
CPU intensive this is actually one of
the better games that we've benchmark so
let's see final result here average FPS
50 by 0.4 went up to about 83 and then
down to around 35 or so now this does
look playable playable on paper but as
you can see there was a lot of frame
stuttering going on and that could get
very annoying very quickly so our
results were all over the place and to
be honest the games that I thought would
struggle the most were the ones that you
can actually still play well I mean if
if 15 frames a second is deemed playable
in the case of city skylines GTA 5 in
particular acted very strange ground
textures weren't being processed quick
enough and it seemed as though in-game
physics were affected as well no one
wants to play GTA 5 with no surface and
thus this one was deemed DNF by the way
story mode behaved in a similar fashions
of consistent artifacts and render
delays now on to City skylines this one
surprised me in the sense that even
though the game relies heavily on CPU
horsepower it still managed to generate
shoddy yet albeit playable frame rates
while playable in a sense that you could
actually do stuff and while our minimums
were truly pitiful do expect these
numbers to rise significantly when we
turn on a second core in part 2 ashes of
the singularity surprise here also
shocked me this game took forever to
load and the three minute benchmark
literally displayed a whopping 16 frames
before ending however I can't label this
one DNF because the benchmark did finish
just you know by the skin of its teeth
lastly and again surprisingly total war
Warhammer managed to keep frames above
get this 60 FPS on average and above 30
when it came to the minimum stuttering
was prevalent but when the CP was able
to keep up the game was more playable
than any of the other three tested
needless to say when we do start
venturing into dual and single core
gaming terror
taury the games themselves do behave in
very odd ways did you expect these games
to react the way they did and what other
games would you like to see tested in
part 2 and don't worry the new
battlefield beta will be among them the
game just wouldn't open with this
configuration right here if you enjoyed
