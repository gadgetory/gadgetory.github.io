want you to believe now utilizing Turing
architecture combining Artie and tensor
cores with mainstream essence they've
made real-time ray tracing possible and
you can't really deny that if shown it
proven in real time right so insane
computational workloads are now being
processed on demands pretty incredible
we discuss ray tracing by the way in
great detail in this video right here
but in this video we're gonna summarize
what we've learned from Nvidia is recent
keynotes and forecast the gaming climate
which is still a bit unknown with this
next generation of GPUs so the hype is
real and Jensen Huang did a great job
pumping the audience with elaborate
terminology and hyperbole like they were
hiding behind something it's his job to
bolster support for his company after
all I can't knock him for that he took
over an hour though to finally discuss
gaming applications seems fit for an
event like Games Con in Germany he
discussed super computers super
resolutions super everything but we care
about the next gen card performance with
respect to game that's why people are
there so an original statement from the
Nvidia CEO was something along the lines
of RT X yields twice the frame rate of
1080 ti he actually said it right here
but we weren't really sure to which our
TX card he was referring and he didn't
actually address frame rates or percent
performance yields with respect to exact
titles that they show later on in the
keynote
he definitely teased us for quite a
while and then he brought in the shadow
of Tomb Raider and began toggling our TX
on and off our TX is that form of
real-time ray tracing which would be
near impossible to replicate on current
Pascal hardware the low frame rate would
make it basically unplayable and that's
why this is such a big deal but we
didn't really talk about frame rates at
all so the big play here with the new
architecture appears to be with respect
to shadows and that's the whole point of
ray tracing to begin with right accurate
shadow interpretation no longer are we
stuck with the dense shadows with fixed
boundaries light scattering and tracing
can brighten rooms with single area
light sources reducing stress on current
rasterization techniques and so realism
intensifies that's gist of it but after
the battlefield 5 showcase Jensen
finally revealed the Turing gaming cards
whatever you want to call them the RT X
lineup the first was the RT X xx atti
boasting 11 gigabytes of gddr5
we knew to 8-pin supplemental power
connectors and to fan supposedly the
card is one-fifth as loud as the
founders Edition 1080 TI if that's true
then Nvidia soror from blower style
reference cards is well worth it other
metrics seventy-eight trillion are TX
ops we'll discuss that later and a price
tag of nine hundred and ninety nine
dollars yeah he originally said four
ninety nine we all thought that's what
he was talking about but you know
marketing hype it was actually
misleading in a sense
turns out the four ninety nine card he
was referring to was the r-tx twenty
seventy this is definitely more
expensive than last year's equivalent
offerings but invidious touting the
quote largest computational leap ever in
computer graphics so you can actually
pre-order these cards starting today and
they'll hit the shelves sometime around
September twentieth but that's really
about where the presentation came to a
halt I was very much hoping Nvidia would
dive more into the gaming aspects like
the gaming performance of these cards
but apart from showing the rage racing
on versus off or a majority of the
keynote frame rates were otherwise
concealed and this may have to do with
the fact that our T compatibility brings
with it a sharp right spike in overall
workloads that would lower fps overall
to comparable pass/fail levels and
that's my theory I think they didn't
want to talk about frame rates because
when all these things are activated
these cars are supposedly really good at
the frame rate Delta's just really
aren't there leading me to believe that
this is more of a real world you know
improvement in terms of how realistic
the games look versus an overall FPS
jump or the ability to turn on other
things like anti-aliasing and handle
those with ease I almost felt the
presentation was slightly just bland I
felt like it was forced at times I think
Jensen one was really trying to make
himself sound excited and I came across
you know the very sour taste to many
people watching I was you know analyzing
the twitch chat throughout the whole
livestream and it just didn't come
across as genuine to me the way that
previous keynotes had and I think a lot
of it has to do with the vast change in
architecture and how there's now going
to be a shift more towards the way the
game looks from a rate racing
perspective from a lighting and shadow
technique perspective you know versus an
overall FPS jump that we might see with
similar settings because there was no
like even cut comparison between the two
not that I expect Nvidia to go out and
release all the specs they have during a
keynote but it just it just seems like
they're keeping something on the DL and
I don't like that that's my
theory at least since these new GPUs are
drastically different and their designs
and offerings we will the gaming
performance may not translate the same
way we saw Pascal's over previous gen
Maxwell architecture remember Pascal is
extremely efficient as well for what it
offered and this 20 atti they're showing
here is boasting to eight pin connectors
meaning that power drawn efficiency
probably aren't their top priorities
this time around so we could be looking
at a more nish visual improvement with
respect to shadows in certain games this
time around over raw graphical
horsepower why else would they stress
the importance of a different benchmark
standard right seventy eight trillion
r-tx ops that doesn't mean anything to
anybody because we've never seen that
metric before and that was something we
mentioned earlier right the Jensen
longer brought up it might explain why
they've shot away from mainstream
metrics only time will tell but this is
how I see it this is what we know so far
it was kind of limited in scope right
the entire keynote was very centred on
shadows and not necessarily the
performance bump and everything else
that we usually expect between other
architectures so in closing and I'm just
gonna say it because I don't think many
others will I don't really expect the
raw performance jump to exceed that of
Pascal's margins over Maxwell in general
games will see our tech support in the
future sure but for now real world
gaming benefits have been kept oddly
quiet smells like someone wants to keep
something covered what do you guys think
check the comments down below leave one
I'll be sure to reply to as many as I
can give this video a thumbs up that was
cool thumbs down for the opposite click
that red subscribe button if you haven't
already and I'll catch you in the next
one this is science studio thanks for
learning with us
