you're new to PC building determining
what is requirements is one thing but
determining which will be quote unquote
reliable is another entirely it's an
overused word and highly subjective no
chart you will ever see in regards to
psu longevity will be fully reliable
because not everyone reports his or her
malfunctioning unit we can however
predict psu reliability based on build
quality circuitry things that are way
beyond me but that professional people
do on a daily basis they know what's
good and what's not and also past trends
it's why we group power supply models
into tiers tier one being the most
reliable in tier three being the least
if it isn't in one of these three tiers
I personally wouldn't buy it unless it's
a brand new power supply that hasn't
been tested yet
I made no secret of the fact that I used
a Tier three deep cool power supply for
Walter White's version 1.0 and 2.0 it's
manufactured by channel well technology
not the best of the bunch and also not
the most efficient but remember
efficiency does not directly determine
build quality they go hand-in-hand
typically a better built PSU will be
more efficient but just because
something is say 80 plus gold doesn't
mean I won't have problems with it or
experience more than I would let's say
an 80 plus bronze power supply let me
play a brief clip of a video I uploaded
a while back what you're about to hear
is my DQ 1000 power supply under load
here I'll do you a favor this is how
loud I sound with the microphone
you know half a foot from my face
that's loud that's a louder than in game
volume by a by a longshot
for more on that video click right here
I was just playing GTA 5 we weren't
anywhere near a thousand watts in this
system under full load still wouldn't
come close to a thousand watts so I have
a lot of buffer room but the PSU got
super hot which means one of two things
it's either getting super loud or a
sensor is malfunctioning regardless it
was not something I was willing to put
up with in comes be quiet I'm not
telling you to be quiet I'm actually
talking about the company be quiet as
you might expect sound is an issue for
these folks they're all about building
quiet efficient components you may know
them from their cases their fans which
are almost dead silent even under load
or their power supplies meet the be
quiet dark power pro 11 manufactured by
FSP it's semi modular stealthy quiet and
extremely efficient it has an 80 plus
platinum rating more than acceptable
holdup time and steady load regulation
if any of these terms seem a bit
unfamiliar I have linked articles in
this video's description that should get
you going don't worry I was in the same
boat one other thing I'd like to note
before running the sound comparison test
is the fact that the dark power Pro 11
is also fitted with the silent wings
three one hundred and thirty
five-millimeter fluid dynamic bearing
twelve volt fan rated for 1800 rpm and
as you can see here literally inaudible
under most circumstances so let's put
the be quiet power supply under similar
conditions as the difficult power supply
one thing I do want to note that has
changed is the fact that I'm sporting a
5820k now instead of a 69 hundred K
regardless load power draw should be in
the ballpark
both are 1,000 watt units both are semi
modular and both have high efficiency
ratings but in this case it's the
circuit implementation and design that
truly differentiates the two case and
point ok I'm in gta' again just like
last time and I've let the game sit for
about five or six minutes I have the
microphone here I'm going to take it off
on the throat underneath the power
supply the power splash shroud in
Heisenberg and yeah I already know it's
a huge night and day difference so I'll
give you the exact same run we gave for
the deep cool power supply here's the
microphone
we're gonna set it right there well.all
and set it right there
there we go
oh yeah you're hearing that I mean
that's that's why while playing you know
there's there's nothing else going on
and this computer is probably drawing a
bit more power than Walter White version
2.0 was just because we have a haswell-e
chip in there instead of a Broadway chip
broad wells are much more energy
efficient well yeah I mean huge
difference I'm going to now alternate
between what you're hearing there if
you're hearing anything at all I doubt
you are between that and the leafblower
of a DQ 1000 we heard previously
huge difference I don't even need to say
anything else and no this video is not
sponsored by be quiet in any way I'm
just letting the facts speak for
themselves you really do get what you
pay for companies that choose less
reliable manufacturers save some cash
and can target wider audiences with
lower PSU retail prices but companies
that keep reliability at their
forefronts will not compromise on build
quality or design for the sake of
reaching wider audiences this Power Pro
11 is a 1000 watt unit most people don't
buy these unless they plan on some
serious gaming or server productivity
both of which are very expensive so
don't do what I did and pair a $2,300 PC
with a $90 power supply that isn't even
in the top tier just don't do it look
for something with excellent reliability
and efficiency that won't put your other
components in jeopardy I know several of
you are partial to only Corsair or EVGA
super flower or C Sonic PS yous but
there's a reason the be quiet dark power
Pro 11 is Tier one you can stick to
brand loyalty I'm not going to try to
persuade you to move away from one
manufacturer of PS use to another you
know what works and what doesn't but
that doesn't mean that anything else in
Tier one isn't reliable and I've made it
a point to use the power Pro 11 in
Heisenberg ultra quiet and ultra
reliable knocking on wood nothing is
perfect so to sum this up and whatever
you decide to build pick a power supply
that fits your demand for any PC build
under about five hundred US dollars
picking a Tier three PSU isn't a bad
choice it's all about saving money at
that point I wouldn't go with anything
under Tier two for PCs ranging anywhere
from five hundred to a thousand US
dollars and certainly nothing other than
Tier one for computers more expensive
than that again I speak from experience
and won't try to hide the fact that I
made a mistake in that regard when it
came to Walter white version 1.0 and
version 2.0 if you liked this video be
sure to give it a thumbs up give it a
thumbs down if you do feel the complete
opposite or if you hate everything about
life be sure to click the subscribe
button if you haven't already stay tuned
for that AMD PC build I've been teasing
about for quite a while I'm waiting on
the graphics card AMD r9 fury I
purchased it for two hundred and eighty
bucks on Newegg we'll see if I get my
money's worth
this is Salazar studio thanks for
