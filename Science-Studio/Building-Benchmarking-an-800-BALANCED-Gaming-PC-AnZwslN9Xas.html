and I'm not that old so admittedly it
hasn't been many years I've realized
that I've tended to drift more toward
the aesthetic play when it comes to PC
builds like this and what I'll usually
do is I'll show you the finished product
and I'll say hey by the way I linked
parts down below but I've also given you
cheaper options as well if you don't
want to make it look as pretty or you
don't want to go with this beefy a
cooler or as nice a case whatever you
can always play with the parts but in
this video I wanted to build something
that was practical it was purely a
budget play I didn't want to throw in a
$4,000 CPU and a $10,000 graphics card
array just for the heck of it I wanted
to do something that I would do
personally with my own money on a tight
budget and the word tight is a relative
term there obviously 800 bucks - you
might seem like not a lot of money or
maybe a ton of money but I think Angra
dollars is a sweet spot and that's how
much it cost me or would have cost me to
build this right here so first I'm gonna
show you a build log I hope you enjoy
that second of the video it's just a PC
tech porn spot if you will and then I'm
going to show you some in-game tests
we're going to use MSI Afterburner
monitor CPU and GPU ttle ization memory
system Ram graphics card memory all that
good jazz so you can see how balanced
this is because that was the goal again
to build a balanced system for around
eight hundred bucks a lot of people ask
me for you know build recommendations in
this price range I think this is the
best bang for the buck you can get
arguably you could probably cheap out in
a few other cases maybe get a bit of
graphics card you can get a weaker CPU
in a better card definitely if you want
to kind of switch it up that way but I
think this is a very balanced system for
the average consumer who maybe streams
and games and really that's about it so
let's start with the build process I
hope you enjoy
so with that out of the way next I'm
gonna show you some in-game footage now
this is just me playing these games I'm
not running the in-game benchmarks
because I don't think sometimes doesn't
give benchmarks are indicative of
real-world performance so this is just
me running through some section of set
and map and then I also had MSI from our
open so you could see the necessary
utilizations and pivoting ram usage
you know GPU CPU ization all 12 threads
for the 2600 here and then I recorded
everything that you're going to see with
Nvidia shadowplay we can do that because
with 1660 here and it tends to be pretty
low in terms of its overhead so I think
that was a good choice here I do hope
you enjoy I'm not gonna bother narrating
this part because I think again the
utilizations the you know which
components being leveraged more in a
certain game that we're testing is
pretty self-explanatory so uh yeah you
don't think my voice anymore here we go
now all of what you've just seen kind of
ties back into the purpose of this build
it's easy to just throw extra money into
better cables right I mean come on like
this is these like daisy-chained PCIe
cables not pretty I've got the ketchup
and mustard 24-pin I'm sure this was
cringy this part of the build was just
also this case it's pretty expensive I
recommend going with just the the
regular H 500 mints EXT this one's like
150 bucks or so I think originally H 500
was like $70 so you're paying more than
twice the original retail this chassis
to get like a custom painted shroud and
some overwatch effects so unless you're
a huge fan of overwatch I recommend just
going with a regular H 500 but I wanted
to build in it because and just I
thought it would be a nice change of
pace so that aside I think the cables
were the biggest just yeah issue with
the aesthetic play of this everything
else I think looks fine but again I
could spend 50 bucks on some cheap
cables and it would look decent but
that's arguably 50 bucks I could have
spent into a better graphics card 16 60
TI or maybe a gtx 1070 on the used
market or a 1080i so you seen i'm saying
like you can allocate money wherever you
want but in this case i tried to spend
as much as i could on the cpu and the
graphics card in a decent case you don't
want to trash case i think that's a
little too far against the aesthetic
play but yeah what do you think by the
way if you want to build the system or
one like it you can find the parts used
here in the video description they're
usually tied to our amazon our new
affiliate account so we had a small
kickback it's like one two or three
percent most of the time if you buy part
by at the link more that in this video
right here but for now i'm gonna sign
out let me know what you think about
this build just in terms of budget I
know aesthetically I could have done a
lot better usually I do cable management
was pretty good but I mean apart from
that like what are you gonna do with
stuff like this so yeah be gentle with
me in the comments with respect to
aesthetics but performance wise what
would you have done differently I'm open
to all suggestions I'm sure you could
have done something better for a
particular game or if you're going for
like a pure gaming rig maybe an cheap
out on the CPU a bit more but I'd say
this is balanced and that was what I was
going for to begin with still or
graphics card was bottlenecking as most
of the time which surprised me even in
1080p so really I think the next thing I
would do is upgrade this
good thing is this be 450 board I mean
the whole a import platform in general
is rather future-proof so I think going
with AMD in that sense is a logical
choice though Intel would usually give
you a small margin in most games I would
pick AMD is the better all-around CPU
because again extra threads
I think the platform is more stable long
term and the price is it's just right
