another PC case this time the deep cool
Baron case liquid this has a 120
millimeter integrated AIO
also a built in flow meter upfront RGB
everything and some really cool features
that maybe you just find quirky I think
that they're pretty cool I think it's
it's a derivation from the typical mid
80 X chassis this is technically a micro
ATX Chasse even though it looks the
bigger than that because it's kind of
built around a micro ATX motherboard and
you'll see that shortly but I want you
to keep the price in mind this comes in
up to 120 to 130 US dollars so convert
that however you need in your country
but this is I don't know I don't really
know how to rank this like in terms of
like value because there really isn't
anything else like this on the market I
want to dive into its features
right now so every time I attempt to
group this case to a certain chassis
category I have to rethink my decision
mainly because there is like I said no
other case like this on the market so I
really don't have a benchmark or a
standard with which to compare I will
say though that 130 bucks I think this
is a decent value for what you're
getting just strictly from a feature
standpoint starting first with the
popularized IO this is the deep cool
captain AO from the captain 240 X that
ever viewed extensively you can check
out this video right here by the way if
you want more detail on just the i/o
itself this is the 120 millimeter
variant so the radiator and the fan are
mounted both up top it's kind of weird
because they could probably a fit a
240ml right up here but I think they
stuck with the 120 just because they did
incorporate the flow meter and they
wanted to keep the price down just a bit
now the fan mounted to the radiator is
actually an RGB capable fan and that in
tandem with the a IO and the flow meter
LEDs along with also the LEDs up front
that illuminate the gamer storm logo and
kind of give the front panel sort of
like back glow are all controlled via
these three buttons integrated into the
chassis which will allow you to turn on
or off the LEDs you can also change the
mode and the colors of the LEDs apart
from that the only other cooling source
you'll find in the case is a single 120
millimeter fan it's very cheap it's
pretty loud it's actually possible to
power in via molex directly
you know that it's just one of those and
I run-of-the-mill base-model fans if you
can I recommend you throw it away and
replace it with something much quieter
I've used it in this bill just to prove
a point
it is pretty loud you can probably still
hear that I do have two other fans that
I threw into the case down below because
one fan at the back and then another fan
rad combo up top isn't gonna cut it
especially for the graphics card you
won't have any fans up front out of the
box like I said those are the only two
you get so you're not really gonna have
much of a source of like you know air
intake you're just gonna have to exhaust
fans at the rear so I don't really agree
with that config out of the box I think
that people should have you know an
extra fan at least one more fan up front
if you can't fit the fan up front then
maybe you should have some sort of dust
filter or something at their rear so you
can at least give you a case a bit of
fresh air otherwise you're just creating
yourself a negative air pressure system
in the center of the case and that's no
good for the graphics card because then
it will star for air now back to what I
said about this technically being a
micro ATX chassis like when you look at
this thing you know I'm sitting right
beside it it's pretty big it's not as
small with most micro ATX cases out
there I would say this follows a mid 80
X like a mid tower form factor but it
does benefit those who decide to use
micro ATX motherboards because then
you'll have space down below for the
conventional power supply lay up where
your basement essentially would be but
in this case because I've used two
full-on ATX motherboard the x99 taichi
from as rock I have no choice but to
place the power supply up front that's
right behind the flowmeter panel if you
remove this handle here you actually
have access to four mounting points
conventional power supply mounting
points that will allow your PSA to hang
from the top of the chassis which is
really weird that means your cables are
just kind of hanging below that behind
this little flow meter bracket but it's
actually I don't know it's it's just
like a regular old basement except
everything's gonna turn 90 degrees
upwards and shove to the front of the
case otherwise I mean what else would
use this for maybe optical drive layouts
if you've had that option you don't know
in this case the difficult ascent to use
it instead as a makeshift a vertical
basement pretty cool though I guess it
doesn't make it a basement any more than
that
now if you're wondering about whether or
not you can see the power supply from
this side over here right if you're
looking into the front panel if you will
you can you can see the power supply
hanging down kind of shift this around
here and off you can see it in the
camera very well and I will say that
it's not too bad I mean even if you look
at it from the front this little front
panel here removed you can tell that a
power supply is there but the power
supply itself takes up about half of the
total height of the case so you know it
just looks like a boxes there looks like
it's being taken up by something at
least and the cables that are hanging
from the power supply don't look too bad
even from that side just because there
are so many of them you just kind of
stuff that any of the extra you know
cable wings back there and it looks
pretty clean also you have the a/o
running there because the the loop has
to connect to the flow meter somehow so
there are two other tubes that run to
this flow meter and those are also
invisible from the back but I will say
if you just look at it you know head on
from the left side it's all gonna be
invisible and I'm ok with that
now speaking of which if you were
wondering whether or not you could mount
fans up front there is an option to do
so I will say however that if you want
to mount a power supply up front if you
want to use a full-on ATX motherboard
which will give you no choice but to
mount your power supply up front then
you're really only going to have access
to one of the two fan mounting points
and even that is gonna be a pretty tight
fit actually it looks like yeah you can
only fit one fan here and that's only if
you decide to rid yourself of the hard
drive cages down here and even then
you've got some parts of the that's
weird just turn it off
and even then you got some parts of the
chassis that are gonna be impeding that
that air flow right because it's not
just a very thin grill so I don't
recommend putting fans up front it's
really weird what I do recommend doing
instead is placing two intake fans at
the base of the case or they're mounting
points for two 120mm fans you probably
fit like a radiator now if you wanna get
really weird with it and mount some kind
of like graphics card rad down there but
having two fans at the base of the case
I would say is essential because it
pulls in fresh air not only for the
graphics card but also for your
motherboard for the VRMs you don't
really need it for the CPU because
that's all a closed system
but four just in cooling you know the
parts of your PC that normally aren't
active cooled it's nice to have a couple
intake fans at the base I just wish the
deep cool had included them out of the
box by the way it's super easy to remove
the front panel and also reinsert it
that's it's a piece of cake that's how
all front panel should be no I like that
there isn't any dead space in the case
especially when you fill it out with a
very beefy graphics card you get a full
on ATX motherboard in there there's
there's no empty space on utilized space
inside the case it's really cool but a
downside to this being so compact is
that if you want to use an especially
wide ATX motherboard you're going to
limit yourself in terms of cable
management because the cable management
grooves these rubber grommets that are
white on the white chassis and black on
the black one are actually covered by a
full ATX motherboard which is a shame it
means you'll have to kind of route
things around a few of the the grills
little slits in the chassis that aren't
a part of the rubber grommet system it's
not Orthodox
it's it doesn't look as pretty and I
assume that most boards will cover these
up I just wish the deep cool it made the
case a bit longer so that we can
actually utilize his rubber grommets a
few more things I want to talk about and
bring up with this case you'll find with
the front i/o just two USB 3.0 ports no
2.0 ports or type-c so I'm gonna dock it
to that also you'll find your audio jack
your microphone jack and then a
dedicated reset switch and a power
button
these are shaped like triangles to
follow just the little grille cutouts in
the front panel here they're also
triangles running down the side also
something I didn't notice especially in
the pictures but I think is really cool
the tempered glass which is included
with the purchase of this case on the
left side panel is slightly tinted not
too tinted to where you can't see what's
inside you can see so it actually looks
decent I don't like the very tinted dark
glass and it's like what the heck all
you see is your RGB LEDs and then what's
the point really can't show off Hardware
just the lighting but you also have the
this kind of weird dot pattern on the
edges of the tempered glass so kind of
blend things into that like black frame
that you really want to look for around
tempered glass some cases especially if
they're like chassés that have been
reused by multiple companies
we'll just include the glass but no like
black frame around the edges so you see
where you know typical conventional
panels were just slid into place looks a
bit messy here Dave Koh decided to fade
it with a bunch of circles in terms of
drive support you'll find a single two
and a half inch tray up front actually
above the flow meter the the drive if
you decide to put one there will
actually kind of sink into the flow
meter a bit the hub there so it's a
little weird looking but at the same
time I'm okay with it because it doesn't
look like anything else on the market
there's also a second SSD tray around
the back against the motherboard tray
and there are also two dedicated
harddrive three and a half inch trays
below the power supply up front now in
terms of branding this case is very
subtle in fact there are only two
locations where you'll even notice the
logo it was a third of the rear but
who's looking back there the first is
just above this flow meter it's RGB
eliminated and the second one is spelled
out up front it too is RGB eliminated
these aren't very big I don't think that
companies that are very confident need
big logos that's just my rule of thumb
and overall in terms of value and give
this case an 8 out of 10 if you want to
separate the AO from the actual chassis
then we're looking at maybe 50 to 60
bucks for that so dock that off the
price of 100 to 20 and let's say 130
bucks worst case so 130 bucks - 60 bucks
right left with $70 that's a $70
tempered glass chassis with RGB
integration which is pretty it's pretty
good bargain now and it will support up
to ATX motherboards knotty ATX just
because it's it's not a very deep frame
then that sends it's not very wide
either
but for the features that you're getting
inside for the CPU cooling capacity that
you also have it's already pre-installed
ready to go out of the box I'd say this
is a pretty darn good value at 130 bucks
there are however two things I would
change about this chassis that's current
price point I'm telling you these things
because you need to know as a consumer
what you're gonna get yourself into you
decided by this chassis also who knows
deep come and actually take these
critiques to heart end up implementing
these changes in future revisions so
here goes first off I would change that
fan at the rear its total trash if it's
mullux power to get rid of it shouldn't
belong in a $130 enclosure especially
but I would completely just ex that
thing out I would even put a fan at the
rear to be
I would just put two decent fans or it's
my phone and put two decent fans at the
base of the case and give the case just
a fresh supply of air from the bottom
there is a dust filter down here so
don't worry about dust buildup and that
should give not only your graphics card
a fresh supply of air but also passively
cool your motherboard and give your
radiator a fresher supply of air with
which to exhaust into the atmosphere
the second critique it seems like a lot
of cases have this critique especially
from me because when I'm building it I
noticed that there just there's not
enough room right I think that the
dimensions are a little too narrow I
don't think there's any harm done by
making the case maybe an inch longer or
an inch deeper and then also maybe half
an inch wider especially for the right
side panel so you have a bit more room
back there for cable management things
look really nice you got the velcro
straps you've got you know optimal
mounting points for hard drives and SSDs
and what-have-you and you do have plenty
of space in the front I guess that run
basement of sorts to stuff any extra PSU
cables but making the chassis just a bit
bigger by volume overall would really
lessen the burden on the Builder it's
just a new experience and it takes some
time getting used to in fact it took me
about 30 minutes figure out how to even
install the power supply up front thank
God for the manual probably the first
time I've ever used a case manual ever
because I didn't know exactly how to
mount the power supply up front I've
never done anything like that before but
it worked out you follow directions I
recommend you look at the manual at
least once I still think they should
widen the case by maybe half an inch or
so and then it stretch the length of the
case out or the depth of the case by
maybe an inch and then I think you'd
have adequate breathing room for your
graphics card especially lengthwise
because this card kind of sticks into
the flowmeter chamber if you will and
then cable management at the right side
is also a bit restrictive you know I
really took my time but if someone's
just throwing stuff into their case
ready to go they're gonna have trouble
fitting that right panel on I will admit
it
so maybe changing the volume of the case
is a bit difficult to do right without
completely redesigning it from the
ground up but swapping the fans is
something I do hope that they but they
at least take a look at in future
revisions off the bearing case liquid
because as of right now airflow is not
the greatest I'm not an airflow Nazi
okay I don't need you know three fans up
front and like a mesh front panel with
every case but at least try a bit harder
than you know putting one exhaust fan at
the top and one exhaust man at the rear
and calling it a day that's not gonna
work for any graphics card you decide to
install but enough with that I still
think deep coal did an excellent job
differentiating the baron case liquid
from its competitors does it even have
competitors I mean really like this case
doesn't compete with much anything on
the market mean come on what case has a
built-in flow meter than like you know
RGB everything it just looks so
harmonious it's not overkill by any
means and at 130 bucks I think it's a
great value now what I wanna know next
is what you guys think about it
it's so weird I mean I don't even know
how you guys are gonna are gonna real
receive this case do you think that it's
something's gonna do really well is
something you would consider for a
future PC build let me know in the
comments below give this video a thumbs
up and thought it was cool if you think
the video or the case itself is unique
give us one a thumbs down if the
complete opposite if you hate everything
