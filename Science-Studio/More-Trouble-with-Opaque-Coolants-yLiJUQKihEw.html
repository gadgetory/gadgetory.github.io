problem with the winter build now this
is the film room if you're not familiar
with this it's pretty bare right now and
everything's kind of cleaned and tucked
away because we're not doing anything
too extensive right now project wise
we're getting ready for Computex I'll be
traveling to Switzerland in a few days
I'm excited about that I get to see my
wife finally after two months of being
apart but we have an issue in this video
this is the winter build version - I put
it together in this card right here I'm
about you to check it out if you haven't
seen that before watching this video but
the coolant in here is just really
causing problems now to be more specific
do you see the transparent fluid in
there right especially on that top port
of the CPU block that shouldn't be
transparent in fact this entire building
was using opaque cool and it was an
opaque white additive that I added to
distilled and treated water I'll show
you guys all that and I'll just show you
some b-roll as well so you can see what
it was like beforehand and then
obviously what it looks like now is
totally different the coolant looks like
it's completely transparent the opaque
particles have basically dissolved out
of solution and I guess are sticking to
the walls of the ptg tubing maybe
there's a ton of it in their radiator I
hope not that's gonna be a pain to get
out and then you can see also especially
the bottom of the reservoir again it's
transparent you couldn't see that little
primo chill logo I guess it's like a
fluid separator keeps things from
getting too turbulent in there that is
something you couldn't see before you
can see it now because again the fluid
is transparent so we're gonna take down
this this whole build we're gonna tear
it apart I'm gonna try to get to the
bottom of why this happened and show you
guys just you know how big a pain it is
to maintain a custom loop with opaque
coolant to begin with
show you a few more clips especially
with the PC turned on you'll see it
better in the end the extra light that
we have with the LED strips in the case
but yeah this is definitely stuck to the
tubing and when we turn it on which I'll
go ahead and do now you'll see that it
remains stuck to the pthe and is not you
know super fluid so that's an issue
that's to build up and if it's happening
in the in the tubing then it's
definitely happening elsewhere my
biggest concern against probably the
radiator just because it's difficult to
clean that you can see it's also kind of
kicked up in the cpu block this is a
nickel nickel plated block excuse me so
you know nickel is very unreactive and
so we shouldn't be seeing this as a
result of any sort of galvanic corrosion
I do believe this is just the the
particles right the opaque particles in
the fluid additive that are falling out
of solution and sticking to especially
fine channels in the block as well as in
the radiator you see here's a side shot
of the reservoir and same story the
dissolved solids are no longer dissolved
they fallen out of solution and are
sticking to the inside walls of the
reservoir I cannot wait to tear that
radiator apart and see just how nasty
and gunked-up it is in those channels so
this right here is primo chill true it's
an opaque coolant concentration mix and
you would apply essentially this entire
bottle to approximately one gallon of
deionized water I didn't use all of it
because I don't have a full gallon worth
of fluid in my loop in fact I probably
added a little less than I needed to
given you know the size of this system I
didn't want it to be too thick right
because then you increase your odds
exponentially of this stuff you know
this crap here gunking up your system so
unless you want to do maintenance every
two weeks which I'd that would be a
serious pain don't add too much of this
stuff you just you don't want to do that
you know they recommend I think this is
eight ounces is it ad true 8 ounce
coolant mix yeah so it's a full 8 ounce
bottle here to an entire gallon of
deionized water you know use this at
your own risk all this stuff really not
just from pretty much over any opaque
coolant additive is going to
dramatically increase the odds of having
thing like this and go wrong with your
beautiful custom Lube that you've worked
so hard on alright so now we're gonna
turn this PC off and tear the entire
thing down clean the CPU block clean the
radiator it's gonna be a depressing and
long job for sure but it needs to be
done because this shouldn't be operating
as is especially with that cpu block
looking pretty clogged in they're
worried about CPU temps in the long run
and I don't even know what it's been
doing to the fittings if any of that
coolant you know that that additive
stuff has been gunking up the fittings
and reducing pressure that hold that it
has on each of the PE TG tubes you know
you just never know with this kind of
stuff so it's best just to tear it all
down and learn from your mistakes I
guess I you know I figured I did this
correctly but uh that's what you get for
going with opaque stuff you know the
guys that are always like you know we go
with distilled water that's the best way
to do it's the only way to do it I mean
they're kind of right right because it's
low maintenance water itself is not
going to corrode anything unless you put
something else in it to accelerate that
corrosion as long as using you know
metals that are supposed to be used
together and in this case we just have a
premature rad which is I believe a
copper rad and then a nickel-plated CPU
block but nickel and copper aren't going
to react anywhere near this fast so this
is not galvanic corrosion I do believe
this is just an issue with the opaque
additive
okay so what you're seeing here is the
CPU block now this is torn down and
washed but I haven't actually taken it
apart yet and cleaned out inside those
fins so all of these deposits in here
are basically caked in and these are
actually solid deposits that are
blocking these channels here and the
channels are important because it
increases surface area it allows the
fluid in the loop to transfer heat away
from the CPU block so this is not good
this is actually really nasty and this
is actually gonna be a pain to clean out
as well and if you use a vinegar or
something along those lines to get this
stuff that's baked in out of it again
and there it is in all its glory and
that is just gross you can actually see
which direction the fluid traveled
because you have like particle buildup
on one side and then just where the
fluid stained those channels on the
other and here's the top half of the CPU
block this is just an acrylic top and it
is pretty gross here as well you can
actually see individual channels or
where this fluid stained the acrylic
it's it's really gross and this is
definitely not not good in the long run
all right now the second thing to check
out is the tubing and I pulled this one
this is one of the runs that connects to
the CPU block and this thing is just so
dirty I'm gonna show you a few shots
here of it from different angles I can't
find any place on this run in particular
that is perfectly clear whatever it is
that these little solids that fell out
of solution have basically coated the
inside walls of the tubing with this one
in particular and it is just it's so bad
I there's there seriously no place on
this tube or it's not just covered with
this the white powder well okay I take
it back right here this is actually a
basically ninety degree Bend and you can
see you kind of have fluid flows so
there's less resistance on the inside
wall to the tubing here because the
fluid is a tendency right to travel in a
straight line so all of the particles
were forced onto the outside which is
why the outside is sorry about the
camera autofocus the outside is mostly
coated but the inside really isn't so
it's kind of cool to see you know fluid
motion fluid dynamics in action part of
what I studied in college
but yeah so this is probably the only
clear part of this entire bent and it's
pretty sad and basically the same story
here with the reservoir again pretty
foggy a lot of deposits on the inside
walls I actually found a way to clean
this though I clean one of the tubing
runs and I'll show you guys how I did
that if you want to recycle these should
you run into a problem similar to this
one but I will need some feedback though
because I'm not sure how exactly this
reacts with the PE TG so you see it now
it's pretty dirty and we're gonna snap
our fingers and here's the tube now you
see pretty much spotless and it's
because I used a vinegar now I don't
have white vinegar I'd recommend that
because it's not colored but I only had
a red vinegar on hand a red wine vinegar
to be specific so it's a little
unorthodox but it does clean the inside
of the ptg tubing very well I'm just not
sure about corrosion if the vinegar
actually eats into the ptg it all
doesn't look like it's reactive but I'm
gonna defer to you guys down below if
you're I don't know a chemist or
something along those lines if you think
that it reacts be sure to let me know
because I want to recommend something
that would destroy ptg in the long run
or acrylic I'll see ya looking pretty
clean thus far I'm going to go ahead and
a treat the radiator now to the vinegar
test as well and that's gonna be
perfectly fine there's just copper and
that won't react with vinegar and we're
gonna see how much sludge we have in
that red because I think it's gonna be
pretty bad look tubing was bad the rads
gonna be pretty disgusting alright and
here is the last piece the radiator this
is going to be more than likely the
worst one to clean and that's why I have
red wine vinegar on hand again I
recommend white vinegar but any kind of
acid solution should work pretty fine
with this as long as it doesn't react
with the copper inside we really need to
clean these channels I'm sure they are
just super gunked-up right now and I've
drained all the fluid that I possibly
can from this so anything excess that
comes out is just gunked-up and stuck in
there
so hopefully the vinegar loosens it up
all right so you guys so how disgusting
that radiator was and took quite a bit
of flushing with that red wine vinegar I
don't recommend again using that but it
did definitely clean this rat out it
smells nice and clean inside and this is
something I recommend doing before you
ever throw a radiator into a custom loop
up front you want to wash it flush it
with vinegar even soap and water if
that's all you got
just make sure you flush it at least
once or twice because most of the time
these will have some gunk some metal
deposits left in there from when the
rats were manufactured you want to get
that out before you throw it into a
customer because it'll cycle through the
rest of the components in the loop and
could potentially clog things up so what
should you take from this video the fact
that opaque coolants or opaque mixes are
risky they're gonna require a lot of
maintenance look just one month in my
system and I already had tubing that was
stained my radiator was extremely
clogged and my CPU block was pretty much
the same and and that's something I
experienced before with thermal take
opaque coolant as well not the white
c1000 going in particular this one I
haven't actually tested yet but the blue
c1 doesn't cool it from the thermal take
basically clog to everything in my
system so I haven't had any luck yet
with opaque coolants and that's kind of
what you get when you add something
other than just distilled water which is
the go-to it's an easy solution and
you're not gonna have many issues at all
really when it comes to clogs and the
stains because again you have no
additives in there saves maybe something
to prevent algae growth but you
certainly don't want in any custom loop
of yours so take this video for what it
is stay away from opaque colons if
you're afraid of routine maintenance and
in my personal opinion I don't think
that the amount of work that goes into
maintaining an opaque fluid justifies
how much better it might look in a
system so you know having an opaque
coolant like white red blue looks great
for a short while but I guarantee you're
gonna hate tearing everything apart and
cleaning it when the time comes
especially when you notice your
temperatures start to spike which means
that your entire loop is clogging likely
as a result of the additives in the
fluid to make it opaque if you like its
