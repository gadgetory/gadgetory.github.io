officially being sued and I expect the
claim will arrive in the mail and either
today or tomorrow sent first-class so
I'm sure it'll be here in a few days but
I was greeted with a very pleasant email
from Dustin the owner of grace computers
who decided that it would be just the
perfect opportunity to sue a 24 year old
youtuber from making a Craigslist video
about his ad that contained his business
address that he voluntarily included in
said ad now I must confess I actually
had a video ready to go about this very
topic although at that point I hadn't
been sued yet so when I show you that
previous video in this one you'll see it
all kind of meshed together if you will
when I change positions I actually
filmed it over there you'll know that
that was before I actually received the
claim now I haven't actually received
the claim and mail yet but Dustin was
again so gracious and kind to send it to
me via email he didn't have a lawyer
sign off on his claim he also sent it
himself which is really weird usually
you have your counsel do that for you so
I'm not sure if he's trying to do this
on his own or not but I think what he's
trying to do is intimidate me and get me
to hire a lawyer and pay hundreds of
dollars to defend myself against
something that says sham is this I don't
think I need to hire a lawyer but I will
do it on a heartbeat if I feel it is
necessary so I'm gonna give you a brief
synopsis of what will happen if I do
have to show up in court what I'm going
to do is file for dismissal and that
means I'm going to basically write a
letter to either the clerk of court or
the judge directly who's assigned to
this case and say that that Court has no
jurisdiction over my company or myself
in a state of Florida because in the
case of a small claims case you cannot
sue somebody out of state unless that
person is in your state when they're
served or if that business for something
the business has property or a few other
things in the state maybe they do
business directly in Indiana that would
be an exception but then you'd have to
sue me for something that I did in the
state of Indiana like some sort of
business opportunity I was pursuing
while I was in the state so there are
exceptions I wrote all that down I kind
of know how it all works but he
basically can't sue me here because I'm
in Florida and this is where I do
business so he'd have to sue me in the
state of Florida and I'm
sure he'd be willing to fork up the
money to do that so that's my first step
filing for dismissal I'm think I think
he expects I'm going to do that he did
at one point say that he would have to
come down to Florida to sue me and he
said he would do it but he hasn't done
it yet I think he's trying to again
intimidate me and make me hire a lawyer
up there but okay now for that I'm gonna
show you the previous video now I think
you'll find it very entertaining I show
pretty much all of Dustin's messages he
thinks it because he puts disclaimers
about like confidentiality and at the
bottom of his messages like I can't
publicize them because yeah if I put a
confidentiality notice at the bottom of
anything that means that my messages are
perfectly secret and concealed right so
I show you all those because I don't
give a crap and I'm not legally bound to
that I also show you the Better Business
Bureau complaint I think that's very
funny as well so if you're in for just a
good laugh at the very least I invite
you to watch the rest of this video stay
tuned maybe comment down below I will
catch you guys in the next video where
hopefully we don't just talk about court
cases anymore
yeah all right here we go many of you
have asked for this follow-up video so I
figured I'd throw this out there just a
few minutes along to close things out
and that's what I expect this entire
ordeal will come to the owner of grace
computers has no case against us so why
he continues to harass us is beyond me
it's a waste of his energy and it takes
time out of our day to have to sift
through his crap that he sends us we've
never promoted violence of any kind in
any of our videos especially the two
pertaining to his business rather all
I've done is prove that revealing the
name of a business whether it be online
in a public forum like Craigslist or in
a YouTube video like this one is not
illegal and we will not be bullied into
thinking otherwise so following the
release of this video right here the
owner of grace computers began sending
threatening messages yet again to our
science studio Facebook page by the way
a little plug for us you can support the
page by following it via at the link
below I should note that we've never
once at least since the airing date of
the last video talked to the guy right
he keeps sending us messages and our
generic auto response usually follows so
everything you're seeing here is raw and
unedited you can sit here and make
little YouTube videos with your false
claims and how you used PC parts picker
to build my machine but fail to even
properly put in half the parts to make
it as
it's not worth what I even remotely had
it close to anything it was not to say
that he wasn't the one who filed the
privacy complaint that we talked about
in our last video
however in YouTube's own Terms of
Service the only people who can file
these complaints are the subjects in
question who wish to have their
identities concealed or removed outright
and on top of that why on earth would
anyone else
a year later try to do this try to flag
our original video for a privacy
complaint so in our last video I
discussed how a public business right in
this case grace computers has no
expected right to privacy especially if
it's address and phone number are
plastered all over Google and Facebook
it's not even like this is his home
address if it was his home address
you know I would probably remove it just
to be a nice guy but this was a public
business and it's something you can
literally Google and that's why I have a
problem because he's trying to bully us
into thinking that the law says
something else when it in fact it does
not and even if you didn't want to look
at Google or Facebook you could also
look up any of this information in the
state business registry at any time
that's because businesses public
businesses have no expected right to
privacy why would a business that
provide services to the community want
to be private then you'd never actually
do your job now this next chunk of words
and this string of Facebook messages
goes into the price justification yet
again he cannot stop with this we've
already debunked it numerous times as
have other people on Twitter many of you
have done this research yourself he says
that including outlet PC was essentially
lying to my viewers he also says that I
only make videos to troll and put people
down sounds a lot like defamation to me
he also says I hide behind my channel
kind of like how he hides behind
Facebook messages he says I tried to
hide things I I have absolutely no idea
what he's talking about here he says we
deleted tweets not sure again what he's
talking about he also says many have
called me out on this I've I mean 99% of
you have been on our side here and those
who understand the law and understand
basic civility so yeah not sure to what
he's referring we've been in the right
from the start here I'll make that very
clear we have done nothing illegal we've
never promoted or condoned violence in
this channel especially in those two
videos again so I don't understand what
his problem is Dustin however has
deleted posts and yes even videos he
uploaded one response that was so
comical ended up taking a
a few days later probably because you
thought we'd use it against him we
downloaded for good measure the next few
messages consist of baseless threats he
threatens to sue us and practically
every message it's a bit crazy if you
ask me he's gonna take down my entire
channel folks better watch out
don't be displaying business addresses
in your Craigslist videos especially
when the posters themselves are the ones
including the business addresses this
does any of this make sense to any of
you
I think it makes sense to Dustin and
that's why I kind of feel bad for the
guy now a funny part of this entire
chunk of messages is that at one point
he includes what looks like a copied and
pasted confidentiality notice it's it's
pretty hilarious
this guy honestly thinks that by posting
something like this it's somehow
restricts me from publicizing it what's
wrong Dustin there's nothing to be
ashamed of he'll probably try to sue me
for this too I'll keep you posted so at
this point he supposedly opened an FBI
investigation yeah this message right
here still waiting for them to barge
into my apartment at any moment that's
sarcasm and then he starts threatening
with the lawsuit again then we get a
final notice and then we get another
yeah final notice then he gets into this
personal stuff and I look up to this
point we have not responded remember we
haven't responded a single time
personally either will or myself to
these messages just our automated
response that he knows is automated so
I'm gonna talk to you now Dustin this
was never about any anyone else other
than you and I this was never about your
family your kids whatever I'll publicly
condemn anyone publicly condemn anyone
who threatens the life of you or your
family or mine for that matter obviously
but you can't accuse me of harassment
and violence for making these kinds of
response videos I've never pointed
violence on this channel and I never
will so stop trying to lump me in with
that because that right there is
dangerous for you legally to defend in
court I'm not pressing charges at this
time but I certainly think I have enough
to at least get a restraining order on
you because it's getting a little out of
hand
oh throughout this time by the way the
owner filed a complaint with the Better
Business Bureau which I mean come on the
BBB really you're gonna bring the BBB
into this it's just first class Priority
Mail comedy at this point and it Dustin
alleges that I yeah insinuated a
and harassed my viewers he says that I
lied and misinformed viewers based on
quote my opinion he then accuses some
other guy of like filing the privacy
complaint that we talked about in our
last video which why he would do that a
year later I'm not sure and I'm sure if
he can do that he then accuses me
directly of harassment to conclude the
entire thing the balls this guy has and
the complaint ends with a request to I'm
just gonna read it I says I am seeking
removal of all videos and a public
apology asking users to remove the
reviews he's talking about I guess some
negative google reviews and a no-contact
order stipulated that there is to be no
further videos contact or information
posted but let me tell you dust and the
reason why this video this one right
here that you're watching exists is
because of this complaint I'm not
intimidated by the BBB I don't care
about providing services anyone else
outside of these videos so I'm not
intimidated
nice try as probably as far as you'll
get you're not gonna be able to sue me
and even if you do again good luck in
court but the reason why this video
exists is because you sent this let it
go if you don't let this go I will
continue to make these videos I don't
care if anyone watches I don't care if I
get one view I will still make these
videos because you deserve to be called
out when you do stuff like this when you
try to pull this crap and defame my
company I yeah I take it personally oh
by the way the public apology that's not
happening the removal of all videos also
I'm not gonna happen I think the saddest
part of all of this is the fact that
Dustin does not understand the law at
least in my eyes he doesn't understand
that he can't lawfully silence the
speech of law-abiding citizens and
businesses it doesn't matter if you're
in the United States or some other
developed country it's in most most
countries out there probably have some
law that protects this kind of speech in
the United States that's the case that's
the issue here and it's likely why he
took drastic measures and opened a
complaint or whatever with the FBI okay
I doubt he even called oh gosh the if
the guy thing was really funny
ultimately nothing - the amount of even
a cease and desist letter has been
received on our end he has her business
address it's how he filed the BBB
complaint but I highly doubt anything
else comes with this he's I mean he's
publicly detested his local police
department and his court system
if you really have no faith in them then
you probably are motivated to follow
through with another lawsuit that will
require you to show up in the state of
Florida contrary to what he originally
thought he thought he could pull me to
Indiana now if you're gonna sue me here
you got to come here where I live and
you gotta take me to court
we'll be interesting to see how that
plays out if it even does but now -
Dustin straight up let it go you have
your livelihood I have mine if you'd
have buried this when the original video
aired we wouldn't be here today let it
blow over
don't play The Verge do not play victim
okay you won't get a youtube ban on my
channel we've done nothing that violates
their Terms of Service and again we've
never ever condoned or promoted violence
find it and I'll call it out when I see
it that's where I want to end to all of
you watching leave this guy alone don't
leave fake reviews don't harass his
family capiche we're good all right
thank you all for watching thank you for
the support and we'll keep you updated
if anything else is thrown our way this
is science video thanks for watching and
thanks for chatting with us
