earth is taking so long why can't we
just finish this build already well
because we don't have the graphics card
blocks yet aqua tuning and having a few
issues with the shipping they sent them
out I do have the tracking numbers so
they will be here more than likely next
week in which case I won't receive them
until next Thursday and that's because
I'll be out of town for Mardi Gras
weekend so yeah we have an extra delay
just because of the holiday here in
Louisiana but apart from that everything
else should be good to go obviously when
I get the graphics card blocks installed
I'll be able to finish the tubing runs
from the reservoir to the blocks and
then from the blocks to the CPU block
now speaking of the CPU block check this
thing out it's an ice block just like
this one here except this one has a nice
metallic blue hue on top of it and this
is thanks to mod my mods I want you guys
to check them out in the video
description they just they just wanted
to do this because I thought that it
would make project sky blue sky look
even better and I really think it does
so check this out the lighter blue
matches these I'll get to these in a
second but the darker blue trim here on
these cables that Tony made us match
almost perfectly with this block same
with the darker trim up there as well so
we're gonna replace this block and you
know just check that out I like the the
subtle blue being thrown into blue sky
obviously that kind of works out that
way but yeah so this block is really
cool I like the little white a little
white logo you can actually replace
these so they have a mod kit for the ice
block xpx and that's so I went ahead and
put the the white logo in there as well
to obviously match the few white accents
within the PC and then the other thing
that I want to show you guys the other
things really are these actually very
very versatile back plates and these
back plates are from a song
over at v1 Tech I know you've heard of
them before their website is also in
this video's description they make a
bunch of custom gear just stuff that you
can purchase to make your rig look even
better than it probably already does and
all that's included I mean the mounting
system is very rudimentary but that's
what's so cool about it for integrated
magnets I know the cameras having a
serious problem focusing right now that
is the reflections this is a glossy
finish here on these back plates but
those integrated magnets just mount to
the four screws that surround the GPU
and boom there you go you've installed a
backplate well on top of your backplate
if you already have one you can also
just mount it directly over the PCB and
you'll be good to go so you can see I've
got one on each graphics card and the
sky-blue trim here matches almost
perfectly the cables that Tony made us
again so we have something complementing
the lighter blue and then we also have
something complementing the darker blue
the custom ice block from mod my mods
now another piece to this puzzle RGB
trident z ddr4 i am going to make it
look just like this color right here if
this ice blue and you'll see why here in
a second but all the cool kids are using
RGB tried and z all of a sudden and a
g.skill said they'd send over eight was
this 32 gig kit i think it's a 32 gig
kit so yeah we'll keep i the same four
spaces that these are these are exactly
the same except these don't have the RGB
integration just that white trim on top
now two other things I want to show you
the two Mayhem's dyes that I purchased
for the Alpha cool coolant that you saw
in part 1 this is the UV ice blue from
Mayhem's the cool thing about this
coolant is that it's completely clear I
mean you can't tell that it's actually
colored when you don't have a UV light
on it so this is a UV strip right here
I've got it jump from a 24 pin on a
power supply and this is just a little
vial I made and we're gonna drop the
coolant in and you're gonna see what
color it is with the UV light on so I'm
gonna turn this off now the the strip
looks a bit bluer and the camera's lens
than it does in in real life through
human eyes because the camera picks up a
different range of frequencies so look
it a little different but for the most
part you know you see it glowing right
there that's the color of the cool it's
called ice blue
as I was saying because this is UV
reactant if I unplug the UV strip all
the color goes away looks like clear
water just something to keep in mind
it's not going to be light blue like
this all the time only when the PC is on
now the other color I have is the blue
dye from my aunt this is non UV reactant
so I'm going to kind of experiment
around with this I might throw some
regular blue dye in with the ice blue UV
just so there is some kind of color
there when the computer is off what I
will do though is mix both here just so
we can get an idea what this dye looks
like see this is much much darker than
the ice blue curious what it looks like
that plugged in you can see the fluid is
so dense now put so much of the dye in
there that I'm twisting this around and
the blue dye really isn't moving much
but yeah so we'll kind of play around
with both of these find something that
looks good all the time I'm actually
liking this combo right here and then
we'll take whatever we finalized and
throw that into the final product so
that's it folks I do apologize for the
part for delay it's why I made this
video to explain what the heck is going
on and also to showcase a few other
things that have made their way into the
studio since part 3 so the the water
block from mod my mods the v1 tech back
plates the RGB Ram as well as the mayhem
to die which all that I think when it
all comes together should make project
blue sky look pretty dang dope what do
you think one other thing that I want to
mention you guys were talking about how
this is like orangish on one side well
on this side it's black so the tops of
the fins are painted but the bottoms
aren't that's to allow the heat to
dissipate without being impeded by any
paint on the fin so that's just straight
up copper there that you're looking at
if you have any other questions leave
those in the comments this is Salazar
studio thanks for learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
