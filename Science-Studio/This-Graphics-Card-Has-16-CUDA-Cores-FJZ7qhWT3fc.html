popularity when it came to the $7 CPU
video which you can check out in the
cart above me I've decided to move on to
a graphics card and in this case I have
found after hunting for hours upon hours
and NVIDIA g2 10 now this card is not
powerful by today's standards or even
the standards during the time at which
this card was released it comes equipped
with 512 megabytes of gddr3 2d or 5 a
64-bit memory interface and 16 count'em
16 cuda cores yeah so this card is not
powerful now and it wasn't powerful back
then but can it still run games that
existed around the time that this card
was released so I'm talking about games
specifically like counter-strike
minecraft in Crysis all of which are not
very GPU intensive today but could
result in some massive graphics card
bottlenecks if the graphics card becomes
too weak which I believe will be the
case in this case so that's it those are
the three games I'm going to try I'm
also going to throw some modern triple-a
titles at the 210 just to you know even
see if they run but worst case you will
have three titles from around the time
that this card was released to test with
and we'll go from there so let's go
ahead and swap the cards out and see
what happens
so what I'll be doing is throwing this
2/10 into the rig behind me swapping
that out with the cards currently in
there
the CPU is a Xeon twelve-thirty v5 which
is a fork or a thread processor and it
is currently overclocked to 4.4
gigahertz using the base clock method
and we're also running to 4 gigabytes
sticks of ddr4 currently clocked to 2133
megahertz
okay a bag of mixed results let's talk
first about csgo that card is still hot
actually csgo and all honestly
disappointed me of it when it came to
this card I expected the graphics card
to produce around 30 frames per second
consistently consistently but that did
not happen we saw a lot of frame
stutters a lot of skips pretty much
render this game unplayable especially a
game like csgo I would not recommend
this card for the simple reason that
other people are running this game at
like 144 Hertz and above and they're up
seeing all those frames they're seeing
144 frames and up and in a game like
this where things are very intense and
you're moving around a lot those frames
do count if you don't believe me check
out the video above me enough again the
surprised me but for a very good reason
was GTA 5 I expected this game to just
not open up altogether games like dirt
rally didn't Tomb Raider didn't a few
others didn't that I did try but GTA 5
was the only one that worked and that
was that was phenomenal it might be the
GTA 5 as DirectX 10 support where these
other games don't I couldn't open a
black ops 3 because the game is built on
DirectX 11 and this car doesn't support
DirectX 11 so kind of Sol there but back
to GTA 5 I was actually able to run the
built-in benchmark which was something I
wasn't able to do on the $7 CPU build
but I had to keep everything literally
turned down all the way and I had to run
the game at a resolution of 800 by 600
hence the very small window there
another thing I should mention is the
fact that GTA 5 has a minimum vram
requirement that exceeds what is offered
by the to 10 the game required about 800
megabytes of VRAM but this card of
course only offers 512 megabytes of it
which I believe cut into our frame rates
more than we would have seen had we had
sufficient amounts of VRAM around one
gig or so as for minecraft well a subpar
I think is the word that best describes
the experience we were hovering around
18 fps the whole time needless to say I
wouldn't recommend this graphics card
even for a game like that one thing that
was cool and noteworthy however was the
fact that when I conducted the TNT
detonation test with just a single block
of TNT and then 27 blocks stacked
against each other
the detonations of those TNT blocks
really did not result in a severe
framerate dip and that
believe is because of the fact that the
CPU was pulling a lot of the weight in
that case so those kinds of explosions
in Minecraft do take a toll on the CPU
and I've proven that in the video in the
card above me but it was cool to see to
see if you actually stepping in and kind
of taking things over daring those
specific scenarios in the game lastly
Crysis can it run Crysis that answer is
no the game would open up and I was able
to kind of move around a little bit but
I quickly ended the experience because
it really wasn't all that great of an
experience and when you compare Crysis
to something like csgo Crysis is more
intensive but I didn't think it was that
much more intensive just goes to show
you why that question has so much
meaning even today can it run Crysis
that answer is again no do I recommend
this card the short answer is no the
long answer is no not under any
circumstance and let me tell you why if
you wanted to purchase a card right now
with a similar form factor and price
that's also much more powerful you could
purchase for example the GT 710 now this
card isn't going to allow you to play
GTA 5 1080p maxed out settings at 60fps
but what it will do is allow you to play
some of those older games without many
hitches whatsoever you will be able to
surf the web watch youtube videos in
1080p 60fps no problem the bad card I do
recommend if that's all you plan to do
with your PC but this card right here I
do not recommend at all goodbye
