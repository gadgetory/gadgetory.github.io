wrong channel I gave the 7900 XCore i9
CP from Intel a lot of flag for running
extremely hot and having terrible value
and I still stand by those words it cost
about one thousand US dollars despite
only having ten cores and while that
seems like a lot on paper you can
extract comparable performance from an
eight-core horizon CPU so what then is
the 79 80 x ee offering that the 7900 x
does not and if you're going with x2 9 9
for that matter what motherboard should
you choose it's time we take a closer
look at some serious firepower this is
the gigabyte horas X 299 gaming 7 pro
big name for a showstopper of a
motherboard one of the most dense ATX
boards in existence from a strictly
feature standpoint loaded with this
future-proofing RGB LEDs and sporting a
hefty price tag under the hood you'll
find a 3 m dot 2 slots 5 full size PCIe
slots to it 16 lanes one at 8 in the
last 2 at 4 a redesigned power delivery
system built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth amp
up surround sound audio and the mighty
LJ 2066 socket I think the board looks
beautiful I love the dr debugs present
i'm counting eight 4-pin hybrid fan
headers though one albeit is being used
by the included vrm fan which is nice
active cooling there and the chipset
heatsink is sexy is always on these
horas lineups one thing I'm very keen to
testing however is this new phase
systems galaxy's no softy when it comes
to power and I expect a double six plus
one phase config should keep things nice
and hydrated below and by the way once
we pop in the 79 ATX
I behemoth expect to pull around 600
watts of power alone from the CPU when
heavily overclocked not easy to do but
you know some people have gotten to
five-year Hertz on this chip so now
let's shift it to the CPU this is an 18
core 36th red-giant maybe not as the
biggest threat Ripper in terms of
physical size but undoubtedly more
powerful thanks to its higher stock
clock speed as well as it's over
clocking potential and the reason why
I'm stressing this board from gigabyte
is because as you'll see shortly
overclocking requires an immense amount
of power and cooling which the gaming 7
pro can handle with ease at least on the
power delivery side now to be clear this
isn't a gaming CPU 18 cores is severe
overhead in fact would be like an
utilise half of them and we can see with
these benchmarks here they're showing no
promises at all in fact GTA v was
underperforming with respect to our 7900
X thanks to its lower clock speed it's
just more difficult in general to reach
the same overclocks
with a higher core count chip on top of
that I couldn't reach 4.6 even if I
wanted because the CPU just gets so darn
hot even universe sandbox to fail to
impress despite its heavy CPU
utilization in our earth and many moons
simulation Doom was a similar story once
we passed a certain core threshold the
only thing really holding us back is our
frequency 4 gigahertz just isn't cutting
it here in fact we're performing about
on par with eight core horizon CPUs that
cost well I'll be at about 6 times less
than the CPU here not all is dim though
we do see substantial gains in our
3dmark fire strike physics test not
really applicable to the hardcore gamer
but still worth noting from a raw
horsepower standpoint a 17-8 exe leaves
no stone unturned we crushed an ax bench
at 4 gigahertz with a score of 38 49 and
if we'd match the 7900 x is 4.6
gigahertz frequency we'd have nearly
doubled its score Geekbench wasn't as
impressive for our 18 core giant but
it's stressing a wide array of resources
and of course we're looking at identical
IPC's across sky like X as seen in our
single core scores a typical application
for higher core count CPUs is content
creation rendering editing and the like
we benefit from 18 cores with the 79-80
X II in Adobe Premiere Pro but not to
the extent I had hoped this ultimately
comes down to optimization and thus
utilization more appropriate fits for
the CPU fall under the realms of
encoding and virtual machines now it's
still difficult to recommend this
platform if you have to question whether
or not you need it then you don't need
it
I've got a few friends who always end up
buying these because their workloads and
they favor Intel platforms and I totally
get that but this is still a
one-percenter market heck I would argue
for that matter that the Red River is as
well but if you've got x-29 on in your
site's there is one thing I can say with
confidence the gaming 7 Pro from
gigabyte is no slouch not only does it
look great and boast most of the
features that you'd be looking for it
also has an excellent thermal design and
a consistent UEFI with two ape and power
connectors that's important for most to
extent on boards you can be sure that
power delivery will be in check and that
your temps will also be in check thanks
to the active vrm cooling and the newly
designed power delivery system in short
a grade board just not so great a
platform you could squeak out 80% of the
79ad xcs performance with a thread
Ripper 19:50 x which mind you costs
$1,000 less I've linked both CPUs along
with their compatible motherboards ones
that I would recommend in this video's
description if you liked this video be
sure to give it a thumbs up I appreciate
that thumbs down for the opposite or if
