Hertz tests on YouTube in my case I'll
keep it short and sweet that answer is
yes and even if we assume your PC can't
push out those kinds of frames yet
assuming you have the audacity to
purchase one of these in the first place
you're still likely to sit comfortably
above 100 Hertz which is leaves and
pounds on both 60s I know in whose game
but anything about 60 and they'll tell
you that so meet the BenQ Zoe
Excel 2546 we have two of them there are
240 Hertz 24 inch 1080p e-sports
monitors they are literally designed for
intense first-person shooters like csgo
and things are looking pretty intense
right now and who better to have deliver
impressions of the panel and then a
professional csgo player this is my
fiance Lisa catty no I met her in Taiwan
for Computex last year and asked her to
marry me a little over seven months
later so yes say hi to YouTube
hi everyone my name is Lisa I was a
professional csgo player for Team expert
in Germany Coulomb sa in Thailand and
Penta eSports in Germany I've been
playing Counter Strike for just over 10
years and my monitor choice of course is
very important the XO 25:46 has an
extremely high refresh rate at 240 Hertz
but this is not the only thing to
consider in the game every weapon has a
recoil some more than others for example
the ak-47 my favourite weapon by the way
so if your spray with you against
something called dynamic accuracy
reduces the blur you would otherwise see
with the screen moving really fast black
equalizer is also packed into this model
which brightens dim areas of the map so
I can easily spot enemies in dark places
for example in the cobblestone map or
does two tunnels you can also quickly
swap between various display calibration
with the included s which if darker maps
show up or you feel like playing a
different game I can click on one of
these buttons without talking through
the on-screen display I like to place
these go with high saturation while I
play for example patchy or League of
Legends with default settings one other
concern many people tend to have is in
regards to DTM technology high refresh
rates are easier to obtain but viewing
angles can be trashed what I experienced
with panels of this size however is that
you won't notice those color distortions
if you face it from the front which is
probably what you should do anyway when
you play games you can check out Greg's
video about TN technology in this card
right here I had to watch it before
talking about this stuff to GT me I
prefer smaller monitors when I play
first-person shooters and I especially
don't like curve monitors for them this
is another way companies tried to fix
the viewing angle issue associated with
TN once at a tournament we were all
forced to play on court monitors and it
was a big surprise because as far as I
know almost everyone plays on the flat
panel even in practice and if it's ultra
white the fixed points of grenades and
games are changed because of the stretch
resolution C's go gamers aren't used to
anyway I'm talking out of my experience
based on play
Counter Strike as a professional so of
course for other games the effects and
experience can be different meanwhile
what's going on everyone so these are
been qxl 2546 --is in a nutshell their
240 Hertz monitors they are TN panels I
believe they're 1080p and we have two of
them actually because well she needs
them for what she does she is a twitch
streamer she used to be a professional
csgo player she's still a pro trust me I
tried beating her and I didn't go well
so she's got a pretty like it's an okay
setup I mean this is this is an
excellent monitor from a Seuss's 1440p
165 Hertz but she needs two monitors and
she's been using her iPad as like her
second screen and we all know yeah how
difficult it is to use Apple products
with Windows so we just went to Bank you
and said hey we need some kind of
solution that that she's gonna love of
course all the pros use Behnke monitors
and they sent us literally their best
like their best gaming monitors
especially for csgo so we're gonna set
both of those up we have a custom like
dual monitor stand we're gonna put up
there wow that was a really crooked
angle just now and hopefully we can
clean this up because I'm telling you
like this just looks terrible back here
like you have this ugly gap between the
monitor and the tower and the cables are
just everywhere and we're gonna we're
gonna clean this up okay so here's the
vivo dual monitor decimal we're talking
about these are good for I believe up to
27 inch monitors and these from BenQ are
24 inch I should say Zoe
Ben Q and Zoe are like thank you is the
parent company but so is the
professional eSports brand and we're
gonna be mounting both on to this so
basically she's gonna be doing all the
work and I'm just gonna be holding the
camera so I wasn't sure about quality
this thing's pretty sturdy it's well
built
I was really loud and it's a pain to
bend the hinges that's for sure of
course when the monitors are on there
you have a bit more torque so that won't
be a problem she is uh just now setting
up the base and if you notice see this
is this is an actual base that you place
on top of a desk this is not one that
you kind of like mount to the back with
a you know a vise or anything like that
this is just something you place gently
on the desk and that should be pretty
sturdy to see how heavy this thing is
that's all it's like ten pounds or so I
opened up one of the Benki monitor boxes
I kind of want to walk through what you
get inside here so DisplayPort cable of
course no way to run 1080p 240 Hertz USB
cable so you can plug peripherals into
the monitor directly I presume power
cable so it looks like we have an
integrated AC adapter which is nice we
have a switch mode this is where you can
switch modes on the monitor fairly quick
it's like a dedicated switch I think
this plugs into the USB port to be
honest and this is a stand of course
we're not gonna need this though because
she's working on that over there looking
nice alright so we got them lined up but
almost perfectly I guess horizontally
and she is taking care of cable
management the kid actually includes
some like little straps that wrap around
the poles at the rear I've got to say
these monitors look pretty sexy from
behind and have a shame you're not gonna
be able to see them and so you can run
DisplayPort and the power cables through
these it keeps some you know suspended
that we don't see them from the front so
they're all lifted above the base of the
monitors in my experience with monitors
over the years I can say that I'm
impressed with what this one has to
offer at its price point these are thin
panels packed with i/o support and OSD
options and of course we rockin at 240
Hertz refresh rate this panels biggest
selling point by far but I also want to
discuss hardware requirements to reach
these frame rates something that many
people are bound to overlook obviously
to have the full 240 Hertz experience at
your PC will need to pump out that many
frames per second putting serious load
on especially the CPU Vanek you does
briefly touch on recommended system
specs by outlining bare minimum graphics
card requirements but this isn't
actually the full story in fact it's
very likely you'll be limited by your
CPU in these scenarios not your graphics
card or cards
it's the GPUs job to draw and render
frames and it's the CPUs job to group
commands and calculations and the
handoff process between the CPU and the
GPU GPUs can handle high frame rates
because they're packed with up to
thousands of cores stream processors and
AMD side and CUDA cores on Nvidia's but
CPUs can struggle to sorting these
functions at the draw calls from the
graphics card continue to arise so
really what bank you should put in place
of these recommendations are AMD and
Intel CPU one since the CPU being used
will likely be the limiting factor here
and since in-game graphics can always be
lower to alleviate the stress on the GPU
it makes sense to you know put the thing
that's gonna be the vault when I go on
the website now while I'm certainly no
pro gamer I can say that the TN
technology implemented here is
satisfactory I mean it's teen it's about
as good as teens gonna get 24 and a half
inches is a good diagonal size since the
viewing edges from a roughly two foot
distance and doesn't incite a sharp
angle from the center which means the
colors won't be distorted on the edges
the included monitor stands are actually
pretty intuitive and allow for the full
swivel motion but you can always swap to
custom stands since these panels are
vase amount Abul so what we've done
right here behind me
hello reproduction on the XL 25:46 is
excellent as well to my surprise things
tend to be a bit on the warm side out of
the box though so that will Beck in a
simple calibration or to jumping from
this panel to my Asus 165 Hertz TN is
actually a night and day difference
which I did not expect I don't even
notice much of a difference in
resolution since one slightly larger
despite being 1440p on a suicide the XL
2546 mind you is also considerably
cheaper so if I deem it a better
solution overall for the intensive FPS
gamer and what they have to say is true
jumping back down from 240 yards to
something like 120 which is still a
substantial jump in and of itself from
60 mind you is a drastic setback once
you go up to something this high you'll
have a very tough time working your way
back down if for whatever reason you
need to do that my condolences if so you
can find this monitor along with a few
others that are semi similar to it
linked in the video description along
with our Amazon and Newegg affiliate
links if we do get a small kickback we
decide to purchase a monitor or anything
else via those links we appreciate it be
sure to give this video a like a thumbs
up if you thought it was cool dislike if
you feel the complete opposite about it
