Germany or just outside of the city of
Hamburg at the be quiet headquarters
this is their media rooms is where they
film all their sweet b-roll for their
new products being released they're
showing us around the entire facility
they have distribution centres they have
a bunch of testing warehouses a bunch of
stuff goes on here and they're going to
show us well most of it most of it the
stuff that we can't show you you'll see
soon so this is the power supply sorting
facility the distribution center for
Europe be quiet
power supplies are in this room that a
bunch stuff in other warehouses as well
they're attached to this one but I guess
it's probably the most power supplies
I've ever seen in a single room and I'm
loving every second risk so the box is a
pretty much self-explanatory AC straight
power 10 80 plus gold yeah so you order
one of these and you live in Europe I
notice you could get this box right here
and we're in the conference room I here
with Chris from be quiet you may have
met him at Coffee Tex or somewhere else
on YouTube he's pretty much the front
man for be quiet you see him a lot on
Twitter and showcasing a lot of cool
products they've a lot of stuff coming
up and a lot of stuff they're currently
offering so I want to first I guess ask
you about how you started working at be
quiet and what you think of it yeah
that's that's a pretty long time ago
actually I started with computers in the
like late 90s I think like seriously um
not with the older stuff I guess I never
really worried about that but yeah yeah
till my first PC and 99 I think and then
I went to the States at some point and
bought myself an ethylene 800 that was
my my first DIY PC FY 800 what can I
grab a 37 then when I I wouldn't
remember I think at that time oh no I
had a voodoo hoodoo or
what tell us has something here from CVX
that's for sure yeah at that time they
were really the best I think and then
they had like two chips on one card and
there was like unheard of and yeah I
bought myself one of those so of the
three I guess major product categories
you have power supplies cases and
coolers correct yeah right so which of
those is the most popular I mean that
depends on the under country really
because here in Germany we actually
since the company was based on on
selling power supplies this is like our
best selling product but the other
categories are growing very very strong
and we started with cooling maybe like
four or five years ago and we came a
long way and yeah then two years ago we
started with cases and all-in-one water
cooling like last year so yeah I mean we
we came a long way but power supplies in
Germany is still like roughly 70% maybe
but yeah in other parts of the world you
know it's always depending you know what
what these countries really want so you
have three major power supply product
categories correct you have the purest
straight in the dark power series yeah
that's basically it yeah we have we have
like a few more existent power and power
zone and SFX l which we introduced just
at Computex but yeah those are like
maybe the main areas we have it's like a
good better best so we start with a with
a pure power it started as a name
suggest as like an entry-level power
supply but like yeah over the over the
years it just evolved into into like a
normal mainstream power supply and as
our bestseller so far we have that with
and without modular options so God is
actually pretty good and well priced
that you can you know really have like
they're the main spare mainstream aspect
of it straight power is more very much
focused on silence and yeah it comes
also in Germany with with and without
modular cables so in the u.s. we
basically have only modular power
supplies and yeah it's more focused on
side
aspect and with a dark power we
basically have like it's our no
compromise product it's just like the
best of the best inside you know you can
you can see that also from from test
results you know that those are really
great that's when I personally easier
the dirt Carper land on a thousand one
so this gives up to have 1200 watts
exactly yeah yeah just want to spare
basically 550 to 1200 so we were in the
warehouse with just a second ago the
clip that we just saw so you have that's
your European distribution center yeah
exactly
okay so basically anyone who orders
anything from Europe regarding straight
power pure powers or power power
supplies that's where it's going to come
from the warehouse we exactly Wow okay
muscle car there's a lot of power
supplies down there because we sell tens
of thousands every month and yeah this
is what what we the famous with you know
so power supplies our best selling
product here in Germany or basically in
Europe as well so yeah we we put a lot
of focus into like the development into
these products and that's why I guess
we're selling so well we're running
running through the test program here
and then it shows like that and so on
so in a nutshell here where we have
different parts of the power supply your
24-pin your AP DPS CPU for fans all
that's being distributed to this unit
right here and these are individual
power readings and what the system is
doing over there is checking to make
sure that the power being delivered to
this unit is correct there's you know
mineral ripple all that stuff that you
want to watch for on a power supply so
this one is very stable and that's what
it's showing here what it's doing is
running through a series of tests that's
what you just saw that Chris was
pointing to earlier so you'll see the
power shutting off shutting back on very
light load in this case sometimes with a
ramp up a very heavy load so it's
running through a bunch of dynamic tests
to make sure this power supply is in
fact good to go
so once the power supply in question has
been tested on big machines over there
and over there they'll plug it into a PC
like this just a regular old system and
I'll to make sure that it
properly and a real PC just for you know
real world sake making sure that
everything's good to go and so the
different one here but everything is
running fun company was a distributor
before for mainly cases first and then
get a brand have started when they when
they saw that hey you know people want
like silent products because seven years
ago you had like nm X was the only like
retail company where at here and the
fans were just outrageously noisy so
yeah I was automatically how was your
competitive advantage was just a.m. and
I just thought like okay you know the
silent thing is coming coming through
and in this okay it's called company be
quiet and just you know focus on salad
Wow
there you go that's where the name comes
from so you said that be quiet got into
coolers like CPU coolers for example
what four or five years ago yeah okay so
you guys offer a wide array of cooling
products you've got some of the biggest
ones over here on the left when this one
here it used quite a bit and then I even
got some smaller ITX form-factor cooler
they're really great yeah this is what
is almost really nice here huh
and then something pretty small but just
like standard ATX one side yep
yes all very entry level model have pure
Oakland okay just retail for 25 bucks
you know I mean that's you know it's a
no-brainer you know so I guess what we
can do here then just kind of run
through each cooler like what a builder
would look for how much they'd be
willing to spend what kind of coin
potential you're looking at with each of
these coolers just kind of like a yeah
overview yeah as I mentioned down the
smallest one starts with 25 used of mllp
and then Evol all the way up to like $90
MSRP for the very thick one here so you
have like a wide range of products of
course what's the price also increases
the GDP so the the heat every of these
coolers can dissipate from your from
your CPU and we just did like a few
different versions you know for example
you have like the shadow box film is
very slim and here you won't have
any obstruction for with the with the
memory and when you have like very tall
memory which is of course a problem when
you have this cooler here it will be a
little more difficult even though you
can move the fan a little bit up that
shouldn't be a really big problem but
with this one you have zero problems you
know and yeah that's like how all of
these coolers differ you know you just
have here you have a very thick one here
when you want to play around you know
with like with the air direction for
example you can you can mount the fan or
two fans like on any side of this cooler
yeah or you have like a stuff like the
dark rock TF which is like yeah the top
town a top-down cooler you can remove
for example the fan over here to make
space for taller memory again or you
know you leave it on and then you have
like a massive amount of cooling
capability again you know and yeah one
thing we we really take care with our
coolers with is like having a nice
looking of it you know so as you can see
like all of these cooler doesn't matter
if you if you just paid 25 bucks
you still have a really great looking
you have like these nice end caps here
it's on it's just something you know you
usually don't see in the market - Ellis
with any of the competition so yeah just
imagine you have this one I can't point
it out enough just this one in your in
your case you know it's just looking
really great like your own you know like
wind tunnel for CPU so how the
faceplates look really good this is like
the defining factor for you guys that's
what I pointed out with the massive one
like not only to take up a lot of space
in your case which is nice if you want
to ice it it's like if you want to fill
up as much space in your cases you can't
be space just looks unused like you're
missing something even though you
probably aren't but not only is it an
advantage you know just but the way that
air is dispersed through the cooler
through the fins but it looks great at
the same time and you get that even with
the really cheap coolers - yeah that's
nice I really like that one here you
know it's just you know it's just just
want to build quality you know from the
like it's just it's a very cute really
small and a really cool cooler you know
you can just you know when you build a
small system that's just really just
looking really great on it
and one thing we need to mention is like
all of these coolers have our pure wings
two fans on it and in the higher end you
find always our Salamis three cooler fan
on it and that is something you know
yeah III guess you can only find what be
quiet that we develop our own fan and
yeah keep on putting it on our products
let it be a power supply the cooler or
the cooler the cases so this is one
thing I think it's pretty unique and you
can you can just control the silent
factor much better in that way so that's
one thing I wanted to kind of segue into
then so you have pure Wings fans and you
have silent wings fans great oh so yeah
this is a silent wings fan here so I
guess these like it's a these comes in
the power supplies like the higher end
ones you also get these included with
cases you can purchase as well so ok
what is the difference between the other
than just price because the silent wings
are going to be the more expensive ones
but obviously they're that they have
their cool different yeah different
technology and different features I mean
when you when you just look at the pure
wing for starters you know it's it's a
normal fan you know it's just a normal
fan and it's just a they retail for like
10 11 News dollars and I think for that
you get really a ton of like good
features in a really like entry-level
package you know and then of course yeah
when you take the Santa wings this it's
like double double the price basically
but what you get is just really an
amazing technology for example they all
come with a 6-pole motor which is just
much more amazing it's a much more
silent and yeah it's just a better
technology and there's just a ton more
you can see over the mounting for
example you know we have like two
different mounting kits here for for
each fan so if you want to mount it on a
radiator or a case you can take like a
different mounting kit and yeah as you
can see also from the the shape is
differently here to increase their
pressure a little bit you know and those
are just much better fans here but yeah
now speaking of silent wings 3 you
painted this yourself yeah yeah I did
some beautiful white styling links exam
I you know make these like you don't
manufacture
with this you know very difficult you
know it's very difficult to produce a
wide fan because you know with all of
the different plastic parts you know and
and it's just really difficult to really
match everything hundred-percent that
you have like you know one unified white
color so yeah we just took one fan spray
painted myself because I know you like
like a white system bill gear so we
wanted to have a look if we can just
offer you know something like this and
maybe for your next build yes right so
another walter white those coming out to
be in the white now is pro 900 yeah yeah
all right it's going to look really good
and so yeah we're gonna put couple of
these in there actually more than a
couple hopefully I get you to paint a
couple more of them oh yeah
I'd also yeah yeah there are so many
like intricate parts in the stand that
you nailed like you paid everything so
let's say I have a little practice this
looks really good I'm really excited for
this yeah and it looks fantastic yeah if
you if you want to have this kind of fan
you know just leave like a little
comment you know and get our product
department you know get some give them
some ideas you know and yeah would be
would be great to hear your viewpoints
about it yeah that's what I'm telling
Chris like right now there's not a
company that really just produces white
products like you have to get like an
exception you know they're competent
produce like a limited edition white fan
or white power supply but if you
actually have a solid lineup of light
white fans I mean white cases those have
taken off sounds interesting
there you go might be willing to be
quiet and look into in the future I'm
biased I mean clearly like that looks
good it looks seriously good
unfortunately oh is just uh yeah the
production is really difficult but yeah
let's have a look
so normally if we are testing we have to
wait it with display shows a 35 degree
for the environment temperature so after
that I switch will start with system to
display all the details on it over here
they are sense to keep the environment
still the same Levin who it down if it's
getting too warm decide so you have like
you see on the right side the dummy
means free yes just like that's like
below the CPU cooler it's creating the
heat to their connection okay okay the
amount of heat it is cooling and like
this you can also find out the TDP
utility of each cooler you run whatever
you want to have that kind of 60 200 240
250 and then you have a look at the
coolant still make it is certified and
in front that's just the temperature die
already
and they also have temperature dive
inside of the heating block of course
you guys obviously have a lot of stuff
coming out soon much of which we can't
show or talk about still when up in the
production phase or you've got it ready
to go but you know you wanna keep it
secret for a little longer build the
suspense so where do you see market
share going like Nick Nick with power
supplies coolers cases like where would
be an equilibrium for you guys in terms
of like how popular each of those
categories is do you think I mean in
general we are definitely working on
every of these departments equally it's
just yeah as I said you know it's
depends on the countries you know and we
have like a lot of success with cases
all around the world with our cooling
and we are with power supplies they're
building up as well and and like in some
countries we're only selling power
supply so it it's a pretty funny
actually and it's a challenge and I
definitely love it but I think in
general yeah we have a ton of product
coming out actually you know sometimes
you know you think like God you know we
need some new products and then suddenly
we have like you know we we introduced
the SF XL you know at Computex that one
will come out pretty soon then we also
hint it a new straight power line yellow
of the 11 and yeah those are also coming
I think either this year or beginning of
next year and then yeah we teach the
white dot Bass Pro 900 right that is
coming out your beginning of September
and living on the playa limited supplies
yeah and and then we have another case
coming up this year still can talk about
that not too much but I can promise you
that will be very interesting and yeah
and then we're going into the new year
then now we have CS SES coming and now
that we we all meet again in Vegas I'm
sure and yeah let's have a look at what
kind of products we can introduce at
that time pretty good I'm sorry there's
some I know it's like what we're showing
you on in these videos there's so much
to see and we're trying to get as much
as we can in the tour itself but you
guys have been growing like crazy here
you have see the basement Taiwan that's
really great and it's been a great
experience and it's a great adventure
you know and the u.s. is running really
well u.s. and Canada and and we're just
yeah we definitely will focus on North
America and yeah then we start with
South America at some point Asia is
running really well as well you know
it's that's just great that's good good
well we're gonna try to show you as much
of this h headquarters i guess as we can
in this video so stay tuned for more
b-roll some more of the tour itself and
we're gonna check out some cool rooms
you guys got some really cool stuff to
show off a lot of cool testing centers
and dogs and shooting areas it was like
yeah the dream of every like enthusiast
i guess actually when he was going
everywhere just parts everywhere like
rusting equipment everywhere yeah
exactly it's a good environment machines
downstairs you know that's great you
know just test power supply's really in
a really crazy way you know very easy
and you can just have all of these
results popping up suddenly you know in
like a an 80 page review you know it's
just crazy
and just when you think they didn't make
anything else yeah your energy drink
from be quiet I really want to try this
now yeah you do you do that's all right
yeah that's maybe 90 milli require a 1
over time it's good there's this bitch
try it no I can't read in front of the
