have today several things to take care
of kind of off the books here I need to
inventory a lot of the stuff that you're
seeing just kind of laying around here
and not so much like the the other water
cooling fittings and stuff in boxes
already been taken out but the stuff
that we get in the studio that I haven't
touched yet I like to take inventory of
it's good for tax season and it's good
just to generally upkeep keeping will
keep up with your stuff so I'm going to
be taking inventory pretty much
everything you see in that closet we
have a couple things that we're not
going to be able to get to today I do
want to hint on one thing look you're
gonna see several videos today people
like you know making 10 minute videos
unboxing their new rise and second gen
stuff so here you go I'll just go ahead
and boom boom and there you go there's
your unboxing we have the horizon 720
700 X the max boost clock out of the box
is 4.3 gigahertz and then we have the
2600 x max boost clock out of the box is
4.2 gigahertz these are not APU so they
don't have integrated graphics chips and
that's basically all you need to know I
mean this is an unboxing embargo so
that's really all I can tell you anyway
so there's your 30 seconds of AMD risin
now it's time to clean this room up and
take inventory of pretty much everything
so come along for the ride
all right so this is where it's gonna
get pretty intense I'll walk through
some of the stuff that you just saw me
organize over there in a second but the
big issue and this video is gonna be
sorting through these two boxes so this
box is slightly more organizing this one
but this is basically my junk box now we
all have a jump box or queue and this
one's especially junky we had a bunch of
stuff in here I haven't touched in years
so we're gonna go through this probably
throw away most of it or give it away
I'll just probably donate it to Goodwill
or something nothing too expensive in
here you guys probably wouldn't be
interested in most of this stuff anyway
just cables and connectors and just the
old things that y'all probably don't
want that I don't need either so we'll
sort through that try to get rid of
these boxes because the way that I have
it set up in here now you know if I want
something I can just pull the box out
but when I have a box like this in the
closet and then I have something stacked
on top of it it's a pain to get into
this box so they have to pull everything
else off of it first so the way I have
it set up it's pretty straight forward
motherboards here I have my tools and
the bottom there are some important
documents in the middle and then a bunch
of thumb drives you know a CPU thermal
paste stuff like that I have power
supplies here the ones that I'm not
currently using I have air coolers there
and then I have liquid coolers a iOS to
the left of that up top basically
graphics cards all the way across
basically cleared out this spot here so
this is where the little mattress box
goes with all the custom loop gear I
have power supply cables at the base and
then any pre-built pieces that I'm not
currently using will go here so I have
the first one that's a $600 build and
I'll probably put another build next to
it then I'm not currently using but that
I will need in the future for testing
air coolers so I guess the next thing to
do is sort through this thing
okay this is uh extremely old like one
of the original Dell Pentiums what is
this what is this doing in this box by
the way most of the microphone gear from
the box it looks like it was mistreated
and abused I'm sorry about that
we actually used this last year for our
Computex coverage copy text 2017 check
out this playlist if you want a couple
sound bites what the stuff sounds like
not too bad if you want to get a
wireless setup like this you know
usually you have a pretty a pretty
substantial sound degradation if you're
going Wireless and with something like
this it's not too expensive but these
aren't too bad at all even in a loud
environment alright so we have the super
clean closet it is super early in the
morning about 5:00 a.m. or so but it was
worth it and we can see we cleaned
pretty much everything up I love these
cubbies that we bought we got these at
Walmart I'll try to find links to them
in the description or something similar
to these but you know comparable build
quality and and the cubbies actually are
just like great presentation cubbies I
don't really use them for storage at all
now I want to go through just a few
things in here in case you're wondering
we do have RAM in this box this is you
know what's funny is this is probably
about like $1,500 worth of RAM in here
just a bunch of modules from g.skill we
have some from Corsair a few from I
think well we also have team group RAM
in here so yeah that's that's where a
ram goes it's actually an old alpha cool
fittings box and the last thing I want
to show you guys is my setup now I did
not show you guys a build log of this I
kind of just put this together because I
was I was feeling it you know you feel a
build you just gonna do it right just
gonna jump on in and I miss the days
when I could just build a PC you don't
have to worry about filming every single
step from every possible angle you know
sometimes it's nice to enjoy a bill just
for yourself and that's what I did with
this one I kind of splurged just a gtx
1018 here i 780 700k a super sweet
motherboard that's the hero 10 I believe
from asus rog it's one of the best as
III seventy boards out there and then we
got 32 gigs of G
skill tried NZ ddr4 along with some
custom sleeve cables from cable mod and
I believe this is yep these are bits
power fittings bits power PE TG tubing
and the thermal take reservoir and pump
all housed inside the leanly
330 X this is the case that I reviewed a
long time ago I actually put it a
head-to-head against the dark base 700
from be quiet check this video out up
here if you want to see more about that
but I really enjoyed building this thing
I think Lou's really cool on camera jeez
it looks better on camera that it does
in person and then I got some super
sweet speaker some Edifier that I want
to review in a dedicated video here very
soon so stay tuned for that anyway I'm
gonna call it quits it's really early in
the morning I need to sleep I actually
need to eat and then I'll sleep and then
it's time to start benchmarking I can't
wait to see what the new CPUs can do
from AMD with that if you like this
video let me know you guys want a thumbs
up I appreciated thumbs down for the
obstacle you subscribe but if you have
it already stay tuned for more content
like this this is science studio thanks
for cleaning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
