science what am I doing here let's ask a
question from Google search why don't
computers use base three this is an
interesting question so a base is
essentially a number of value any number
of possible outcomes base two is binary
since only values 0 and 1 are possible
base 3 incorporates a third value our
basic number system is based 10 since we
use 10 values 0 through 9 to create any
series of numbers ideally the higher the
base the more information can be relayed
for line but in order to understand the
premise of the question we should first
briefly run through how data is
transmitted today binary code is the
most powerful language on the planet but
it looks like this just a bunch of ones
and zeros however the arrangement of
these digits denotes specific
instructions and values the medium of
exchange in this case is the operating
system encoding and decoding commands
dictated by the user
a CPU utilizes up to its billions of
transistors in order to process this
data hence its name central processing
unit fundamentally a single transistor
either acts like an on-off switch or an
amplifier for all intents and purposes
in this discussion and on-off switch
will do and it's open on state a certain
voltage is allowed to pass this is the
threshold voltage in its closed one it
does not electrons will still leak
through a closed state but not above
this voltage threshold assigning one to
open and zero to closed any command
could send a series of electrical
signals to the CPU to be executed by the
logic unit GPU the list goes on so you
can see why binary code and say the
modern tri-gate transistor worked
together so well you only have two
possible outcomes for signal
interpretation open and closed 1 or 0 0
but a signal can also be well half open
in comes base 3 where a third state
exists the benefit of base 3 involves
data transmission theoretically the
higher the base the more information can
be transmitted but every transistor in
the base 3 system would require a new
power identifier way to discern between
two voltage thresholds vs. 1 this
increases the risk of error this would
require additional resources amplified
not only by the sheer number of
transistors in a unit
but also extreme size constraints binary
systems are relatively self-correcting
so the signals degrade over time and
voltage fluctuations become more and
more prevalent a base-2 system won't be
as sensitive to those fluctuations
because the threshold is usually pretty
big in comparison but as we increase the
base number to the base 3 base 5
especially when it comes to something
like base 10 those systems become more
and more sensitive to tinier and tinier
changes in voltage there go a certain
value based on a specific voltage might
be interpreted as a different value
because of that small degree of variance
precise engineering is only so precise
and over time operating systems designed
around higher based code would degrade a
signal noise inevitably increased so
there are undoubtedly massive barriers
between modern computers and higher
based computation the short and sweet
answer it would cost a lot of money and
require extreme levels of engineering to
design systems accurate and reliable
enough to replace modern computers we do
have base 3 adaptations in a few forms
of flash storage as someone forms have
pointed out but the idea of
consumer-grade systems utilizing
anything other than binary at this point
is unrealistic if you liked this video
thought it was cool something new be
sure to give this one a thumbs-up
