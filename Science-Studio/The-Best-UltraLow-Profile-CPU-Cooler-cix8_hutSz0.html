it was designed by a fourth grader but
putting that side this is the sigh big
shuriken to revision B air cooler ultra
low-profile air cooler meaning it spans
only 58 millimeters in height which
means it will fit perfectly I mean
literally perfectly inside the fractal
design note 202 which is where this will
end up eventually in a separate video
stay tuned for that but we're gonna
compare this cool this cooler is a
thermal capacity to other air coolers
that I'll admit aren't the same form
factor right they're not as low profile
but nonetheless for 40 bucks and being
that it fits in ITX cases I want to see
what this thing packs in the box for 40
US dollars which by the way is what you
can buy this for if you live in the US
check out my link down below tied to my
Amazon affiliate account you live
anywhere else in the world you still
click on the link and it should take you
to your respective amazon website for
your country this again at 40 bucks
doesn't look too appealing on paper
especially on the box I mean come on
let's see what's up with all those words
but anyway it's a pretty beefy air
cooler for what it is for how thin it is
and I think it offers an interesting
value proposition on the left so we're
gonna get started testing this thing or
right now
so a few things the big shuriken too has
and they could stand out from its
competition the first thing you'll
notice out of the box this thing's
pretty beefy it's actually quite a heavy
for what it is for its size and that
it's thanks in large part to these five
copper heat pipes here these look to be
about six smilk thick copper heat pipes
and those span from a nickel-plated base
mine didn't have any scratches for the
most part on it which is a good thing
and then these pipes span up to it's
almost like a double layered aluminum
thin array and above the aluminum fin or
a you have a super thin ultra
low-profile 120mm fan we're talking
maybe a centimeter and a half worth of
thickness here for this fan so I'm more
or less concerned about airflow because
these spins aren't able to displace a
lot of air just because of how thin
everything is but apart from that I mean
if you're if you're worried about
clearance this is kind of cooler you
should consider when you're building a
small form-factor PC if you're not gonna
liquid cool you're probably going to be
compromising just a bit in terms of how
loud your system will be the slim fan is
held on by two wire brackets on either
side pretty easy to remove though you
probably won't have to unless you want
to strap a thicker fan onto here for
whatever reason because you will not be
able to access the mounting points
beneath this aluminum thinner a from the
top there there are no cutouts for that
which means that installation is going
to be a major pain now our cooling test
fans utilizes an X 99 CPU which means
that we don't have a backplate per se
everything's handled on the front side
of the motherboard and this cooler
utilizes two brackets one on each side
secured by two screws apiece and then we
do have four screws that are essentially
thumb screws that screw into the socket
around the CPU these two brackets here
aren't difficult to secure you're gonna
need something like a Phillips head
screwdriver that's not included in the
box but that's probably the only tool
you'll need overall because this small
thin wrench is included to mount the
cooler directly to the socket at least
for x99 platforms and this is where it
gets extremely difficult so if you have
your motherboard already installed in
your case then you should probably take
it back out and try to secure this
cooler that way because the case itself
is gonna impede your ability to get
underneath that cooler you also want to
remove your RAM modules if possible
because those again are gonna impede
your ability to
get in there with that wrench and
tighten the cooler down all-in-all took
me about 20 minutes to secure and half
that time was me just fiddling with it
trying to reach those mounting points
and secure them as much as possible now
cooling performance not all that bad I
was actually pretty impressed for again
the size and the cost of this unit it
looks pretty darn good in any system
although it is a little low profile
alright especially for full ATX build
but the cooling capacity again not too
shabby keep in mind all these coolers
are significantly larger than the big
shuriken - and that would explain the
temperature Delta I'd still like to
point out though that cooling of 5820k
is no small task and despite this cooler
being rather small it does a decent job
keeping temps in check and while
maintaining these temperatures the
system wasn't too loud either which I
expected to be the one big compromise
with a big shuriken - I thought okay we
really thin fan and the cooler itself
isn't too large so it's probably gonna
get pretty loud this fan does have a
rated rpm of up to 2000 it's PWM
controlled the wire is braided which is
really nice so they didn't cheap out
anywhere you would expect them to with a
$40.00 cooler from a place that I
probably can't pronounce but ultimately
things didn't get too loud we managed to
stay under 40 decibels and that's
actually something that is listed on the
box around 36 dB is what the advertised
and sure enough 37 dB I'd call it within
the margin of error not too bad at all
all of these by the way we're tested
with a stock fan curve so everything
should scale equivalently and I do want
to point out that I also used each
coolers respective thermal compound the
one in the South cooler box was not the
best looking compound it was a little
liquidy on the surface and then it got
pretty chunky underneath so that's when
you know you don't have the highest
grade thermal compound but I like to use
individual peso because it encourages
manufacturers in these tests in
particular to throw the best thermal
compounds they can into their boxes so
that the consumer gets the lowest
temperatures if we you know completely
neutralize this and just use like you
know conduct a knot then no cooler
manufacturers going to want to put good
thermal compound in their boxes and we
don't want that right we want the
consumer to just be content with what is
in the box because it's good enough and
this cooler thermal compound is just not
good enough now at this point you might
be weighing the pros and cons of a
cooler like this and trying to justify
the $40 price
I think for $40 is a great job cooling I
mean heck of 5820k it's gonna do a great
job cooling and consumer grade Intel CPU
or AMD CP for that matter and it also
stays relatively quiet when doing so so
for 40 bucks it's a pretty sweet bargain
but there are two other questions you
should ask yourself before deciding to
buy this cooler the first is what chips
that you're on and the second is what
Ram modules you plan on using to answer
the first question and this cooler will
only disappoint one fan base and that is
AMD's because this cooler does not have
native am 4 chipset support which means
that you're not gonna be able to mount
this cooler to anything that has the
word risin in it basically and I
understand that's a huge chunk of the
CPU consumer space out there if you have
a rise and CP or you know if in Jimmy
rig this cooler and even then you're
probably not gonna have the easiest time
doing that because of the way the cooler
is designed so I recommend AMD users
stay away from this and if you're gonna
build an ITX rig you're still gonna have
trouble mounting the cooler but at least
you can do that with Intel CPUs
I hate recommending a cooler that's only
compatible one way right for modern
chips but that's just how it's gonna be
because this cooler is so old I'm pretty
sure it's been out for five or six years
now as to the second question this will
depend again on the RAM kit that you're
looking at I would say that if you're
gonna go for anything that has like a
very conservative heatsink just above
the PCB then it'll probably fit I use
these g.skill Ram modules and they're
actually pretty you know Fleury on top
the PCB is a considerable distance
underneath the tops of these heat sinks
and things were still perfectly fine
underneath I had no clearance issues at
all back they had a few more millimeters
to give so actually pretty impressive
for how short the cooler is height wise
it's only 58 millimeters tall Ram
modules you're probably not gonna have
too big a problem with if the heat sinks
don't surpass the height of the PCB
itself by very much so my verdict and
the big shuriken too is twofold
it depends on a few ur an AMD risin user
if you're some other CPU user if you
have AMD resin CPUs your disposal this
cooler is not going to be an option at
least how it is now because it doesn't
have native AM for support but if you're
using any other chipset out there that
is listed on the box it's the LGA 775
1150 X 1366 2011
v3 and then a M 2 all the way up to am3+
and FM 2 plus you can use this cooler
congratulations and also obviously if
you're building in an ultra-low profile
case something like the node 202 this
cooler will be perfect for you I mean
literally perfect it's almost like this
cooler was made for the node 202 stay
tuned for that build if it's not already
listed in the card above I do want to
hear from you guys in the comments below
let me know what you think about this
cooler and some of its competitors list
those as well again this video is not
sponsored I don't care what you list or
if you hate on this cooler it's not
really a big deal reviews in this
channel will never be sponsored by the
way so don't worry about that I'm just
gonna give you my honest opinions on
these things whether I get it from a
company for free or not you know if the
company is willing to ditch me over one
negative review I don't want to work
with that company anyway so don't worry
about whether I bought it or if I got it
for free that's my rule of thumb I don't
like working with companies that don't
like working with me what you can also
do if you like this video is give this
one thumbs up I appreciate that you can

you haven't already in that Bell
