cheaper graphics cards where you could
find them I used a Bay as one of my
sources and I was doing my best to to
provide you guys a little bit of insight
into where the best places would be to
buy used graphics cards because that
really seems to be the only valid way to
purchase a graphics card in the current
market and in my journey through eBay in
particular I came across one listing
that looked especially fishy look if you
know anything about computers if you
follow the market in the slightest bit
then you know that this offer right here
are $99 for a GTX 1080 TI MSI graphics
card is just stupid there's no way you'd
find a 1080i especially in today's
market at that price unless the seller
was being especially benevolent or was
just completely clueless there's really
only two reasons I can come up with my
head so what I decided to do in the name
of mere curiosity was play the stupid
person I wanted to see what would happen
if I actually paid this guy the $99 or
so that he was asking in exchange for a
quote MSI GTX 1080 Ti I mean he wasn't
saying that this was like the you know
just the cooler or like the backplate or
something stupid he was full-on
advertising an msi gtx 980ti like the
legit card and I said okay well one of
two things can happen here I'm gonna
lose my money and this guy's accounts
gonna be banned or he's actually gonna
send me something and try to pass it off
as a 1080 Ti and his account will still
be banned I think he knew this going
into it assuming this is a guy and I
pretty much knew the outcome as well I
was probably gonna be able to get my
money back and if I didn't I'd at least
have something to show for you know
maybe like a 650 TI or something really
weak so I decided to hit up the seller
1957 BMW Isetta this account by the way
no longer exists so don't bother looking
it up I should tell you something about
where this video is headed I immediately
paid the full asking price of 98 dollars
and 99 cents shipping was included so
you know who could pass up a deal like
that right and immediately my payment
was processed that's something that you
should look out for if you think you're
being scammed if your payment is
processed right away there have a system
set up to accept the payment
automatically or they want to get it as
quickly as possible because I don't
think their account will exist for much
longer now
ordered over the weekend so I didn't
expect to hear anything back until
Monday or Tuesday and sure enough
Tuesday morning at around 9 a.m. CST
eBay emailed me saying that the account
from which I had purchased the card was
deactivated and that my payment that I
had sent to that account needed to be
resolved through PayPal that's what I
used to pay with PayPal that's you know
who doesn't use PayPal for online
purchases or maybe the card loaded I use
PayPal for eBay and other things for
Amazon and Newegg but my PayPal account
said that that $98 $0.99 payment was
still being processed now I expect at
some point that process will end with
either a okay your funds were sent or
we've returned your funds because there
was some issue with shipping see the way
that it works and I didn't know this
before is eBay kind of dishes off the
entire like refund process to PayPal
under circumstances like this now it
does say on the sellers page that we had
to remove this listing from the site and
that you're not required to complete the
transaction if you've already sent
payment the sale should process as
normal and you don't have anything to
worry about so I'm waiting for that
money to come back essentially what I'm
in right now is limbo because if I click
on resolution Center and request a
refund eBay says well this isn't our
problem anymore you need to resolve this
via PayPal because you use PayPal to pay
for the product and that's what I'm left
with
sorry we're unable to open a case for
this issue unfortunately we're unable to
open a case for this item because of a
possible payment issue to get more
information please contact the seller
which means that I am left solely in the
hands of PayPal here like that this is a
crapstorm in probably the lightest of
words that I could use and I expected
this to be pretty difficult especially
if my payment process right away which
you know if you're gonna scam somebody
that should be how you do it
don't do that just you know this is just
from experience and because I use PayPal
PayPal is now going to either cancel the
transaction because eBay reports the
fraud to PayPal or PayPal is gonna
process the transaction and send the
money to the seller because according to
eBay which then you know the eBay and
PayPal are kind of been talks with each
other here during these types of
transactions the purchase was made
successfully
and I decided and agreed to send the
payment so I guess we're kind of left
waiting to see what happens to the money
now this is not something that I am
surprised by I don't want you guys to go
well you know you're dumb to purchase
something like this so you deserve it
it's not about what you deserve and what
you don't like fraud is fraud fraud is
illegal
we regardless of how stupid the person
had to be to pay ninety eight bucks for
a ten eighty TI does not excuse the fact
that when seller did was illegal what I
did was just act incompetent that's it
incompetence and something being illegal
are two totally different things
so you can't blame the buyer for falling
for this if eBay allowed it to go
through if they allowed an account that
is in the business of scamming to be on
the site and to advertise a product that
is ultimately never going to be
fulfilled or shipped to the buyer that's
all I really have to say at this point I
will keep you updated check the comments
below I'm not gonna make a second video
on this but just you know use common
sense especially when you're looking for
graphics cards people are always trying
to make a quick buck and if that means
doing something illegal to some people
that's worth it maybe they can get away
with it if something looks oddly
suspicious or too good to be true at
least on paper don't fall for it don't
fall for that crap that's what I'm
naming this video
don't fall for this crap that's that's
yeah it's definitely grounds for
demonetised oh we'll see how that plays
out anyways if you are interested in
what I have to say after the fact after
I received my money back or lose it
check the comments below I'll pin the
results up top whenever they are present
if you're watching this video when it's
first uploaded I appreciate the
promptness and I will get back to you as
soon as possible leave a thumbs up if
you feel bad for for well I don't know
you shouldn't feel bad for me though
it's kind of a stupid thing to do don't
feel bad for me just you know you you
want to be on the side of the buyer
anyway you don't wanna be on the side of
the guy who did something illegal so I
don't know you thumbs ups that's a
little debatable what you can't do
though is click that red subscribe
button if you want to see more content
like this more scientific topics
discussed and investigated in in general

money with us never thought I'd say that
one
