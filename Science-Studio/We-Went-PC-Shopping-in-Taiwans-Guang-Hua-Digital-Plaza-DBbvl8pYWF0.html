to Taipei Taiwan again for Computex 2018
this year we're gonna do a few things
outside of the typical Computex coverage
give you guys the lowdown on what goes
on in the city itself city life and want
to build a pc here are just shop for
tech in general going tois I think I
said that right is the place to be we're
gonna have fun hunting maybe even buy a
few things assuming we can fit them in
our carry ons back home let's have fun
now something to keep in mind before we
start showing the prices here the Taiwan
US dollar conversion rates about 35 or
so to one that will of course vary
depending on your choice currency so if
you see a laptop let's say price at
thirty five thousand Taiwanese dollars
it might seem a lot to you but remember
divided by 35 that's roughly a thousand
bucks for a mid to high range to the
laptop it's not too bad so in the
process you're actually pretty
competitive you'll see that here shortly
I'm almost about the same equivalently
as you would find in the states so let's
go check that out okay first up what
you're looking at here is kind of like
and just everything you could possibly
want in it little store and you find
that this building in particular has a
lot of these small shops kind of built
into the plaza now this one sells
everything from you see we have a ton of
Intel CPUs we have power supplies there
we have a bunch of peripherals you know
mice keyboards headsets we have graphics
cards most of them albeit are pretty
weak by comparison you know GT 1037 30s
are x5 60s are pretty common in there
and then we have motherboards on the
right side but the idea is right you
come in here you decide what you want to
build and then you can pretty much pick
everything imaginable apart from maybe a
case in a single store like this which
is great for PC building enthusiasts you
don't see this stuff like I mean even
fans up top I know you can't really tell
because it's very bright but there are
some fans you can choose as well Israel
pretty up-to-date as well now so this is
a pretty sweet stop here right at the
entrance you see the escalator behind us
and this will get you going for sure but
of course there isn't just this store to
choose from you have many on this level
alone so here are examples of typical
laptop prices here in Taiwan you see
twenty five thousand nine hundred
dollars what's funny is they they still
use the US currency symbol but of course
this is Taiwan dollar that's four gigs
of DDR for 256 gig SSD nandai 580 250
which I believe is a quad core ultra low
power CPU so it's the newest CPU for the
ultra low power ultra books and that's
good to see they don't have the most
up-to-date stuff I noticed that in
hallway and a few other brands are very
very behind I guess you can buy a lot of
stuff in the states that they haven't
gotten yet the p20 though from hall is
pretty big we might stop by that store
in a second Hey look at this
awesome one-hand keyboard I don't know
it's kind of weird but comfortable at
the same time we should play games with
this these pcs what are they that's
pretty smart so that's kind of like what
NZXT does with the the build software
online you can basically build your PC
and tell you exactly what kind of specs
we'll give you what fps so look if you
want to play pub G at 80 fps apparently
this is the system for it now I don't
know what that says it might be might
have something to do with the in-game
resolution or the settings but still
nice and it's cool to see you know a
marketing tactic like this in Taiwan not
something you see too much in the States
alright so we have a dedicated
PlayStation Store they're actually about
three or four of every store in here and
that's because none of these are
actually directly affiliated with the
manufacturers of the products or selling
so you'll see like Lenovo they're like
that's not an official sorry it's really
great like that's not an official Lenovo
store they just sell one over products
so they put the sign up top so you know
exactly what you're buying and then you
have a couple other stores that will
just kind of keep it general because
they sell a plethora of products a bunch
of graphics cards 1060 s I see a lot of
in there 1050 T eyes referrals more
peripherals back there see smaller
stores dedicated just to let's say
storage in the case of a data xpg more
laptops on this side hello
and yeah what I've noticed is that most
people are actually pretty cool with us
filming here and I think that just has
to do with the culture you know Germany
in particular was very anti filming we
had to be very sneaky when we filmed in
the tech market just because people
don't like being filmed and I understand
that right you have the right to say no
but a lot of the people here are k with
it
so this store here is a branded asus rog
retailer and what they have again pretty
much everything you could possibly want
in a pc build all laid out for you're
ready to buy part by part the great
thing about a store like this though
first off they're upfront about all
their prices so you can see the far
right here all the yellow tabs are the
prices again in Taiwanese dollars so for
example 16 gigs of DDR 467 99 s of a 68
divided by 35 is about 200 bucks so
again that's very comparable to what you
would find in the states will have the
exact conversions on the bottom of the
screen down here so 60 $7.99 for 16 gigs
of ram and that again that's you know
pretty high clock to you right 3,000
megahertz lpx corsair ram and if we pan
over here they're actually doing bundles
and this is where things get really
fancy so we have an Intel Core i7 8700
ksz 370 motherboard 16 gigs of ram a 240
gig SSD plus a one terabyte hard drive a
1070 arm or 8 gig card from MSI you get
an optical drive a 600 700 what that
says and you get all that 440 1900
Taiwanese dollars sounds like a crap ton
of money right but if you convert it a
real time here we go that is just under
1,400 US dollars and that in our country
is a great price right now for what
you're getting an excellent gaming PC
again the 8700 K is one of the best
gaming PC peas out there actually the
best right now being getting decent
clocks on it and a 1070 which is plenty
for 1080p moderate 1440p gaming that's a
great great price and it says basically
all you need to build a PC right here
you get it all for 41 900-mile side of
the tech market
in Taiwan and I want to show you guys
some of the places you can shop so
there's an official HTC store right
there
Samsung store just around the corner so
you know all the official name brands
those official retailers are in this
section of the tech space here in Taiwan
now we're gonna go upstairs to check out
what else they have to offer by the way
we were talking about Huawei earlier
this is where that store is and very
bright kind of like Apple stores I think
they've all caught on board at this
point a dedicated ROG looks like land
party going on in that one so coming up
on the second floor here we're gonna
swing right is this cool it's like a WD
Showcase it's actually looks like a
building at Western Digital hard drive
right there that's pretty chill so here
we have sony then we have transcend
that's basically a data storage company
we have HP to their right and then we
have msi down at the end so what does an
msi store look like in taiwan let's go
check it out
it's the following what I was talking
about earlier razor here's an example of
a company doesn't have all the latest
tech in store yet and this is something
you won't really run into in the States
because you don't really have dedicated
stores like these all over the place but
razor in particular is advertising their
older 14 razor blade laptop a 14-inch
model when we actually have I think it
what the 15 15.6 inch model now that
just came out that you can buy on their
website but you don't have in store yet
and that's just kind of weird usually
when you have a new model released or
you're about to release it you tend to
have those products in the shop so that
people can actually and uh play with
them and maybe buy them on site so
that's one of the things I've noticed
the Rays are stored by itself though
it's actually really cool here they they
try to trick all these out and give
people who are into gaming a personal
field
okay folks so that was the wrong flaw
Tech Center here in Taipei and I wanted
to make this video thanks Lisa for
helping me and literally filming almost
everything in there just to give you
guys a little something different we
don't usually go out of the office much
and when we do we try to at least film
in some text or give you guys an idea of
what to expect when you go in them
Taiwan has very competitive prices I'm
very pleased to see that and I am
excited to see what kind of new tech
these companies will have to offer at
Computex this year stay tuned for that
coverage we'll try to do maybe one more
of these before we leave Taiwan in about
two weeks
this is science studio thanks for
shopping with us
