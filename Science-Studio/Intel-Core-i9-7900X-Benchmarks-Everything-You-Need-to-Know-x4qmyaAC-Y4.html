the 7900 x it's a ten core behemoth with
hyper-threading for a whopping twenty
threads as well as solid overclock
ability the CPUs based on 14 nanometers
skylake architecture and utilizes the
LGA 2066 socket the 2011 v3 successor
the mother what I'm sporting here is the
asrock X 299 tight sheet the model I've
been a huge fan of since the first tie a
implementation in X 99 you can also find
X 370 and Z 270 variants linked in this
video's description so this video is all
about that core i9 let's talk first
about power consumption and overclock
ability as a general rule of thumb the
higher the core account the more
difficult it is to push that CPU to a
certain frequency in the case of this
particular 70 100x unit I hit a steady
4.6 gigahertz at one point to five volts
this mind you with a 240 millimeter a IO
which is severe under kill for a CT of
this caliber and a single eight pin EPS
power delivery format a few in the tech
community have pointed out temperature
issues along the eight pin cable when a
supplementary four or eight pin are
missing this board only has a single 8
pin and my cable does get very hotter on
the back but I don't think that it's to
the point where things are going to you
know catch fire it's something we'll
dive deeper into in a separate video
and speaking of power according to Tom's
Hardware the I 970 900 X draws a
whopping 230 watts alone from the wall
that's just the CPU pulling 230 from the
wall that's more than most graphics
cards which are essentially tiny pcs
themselves tweak'd P States bring idle
consumption down to insanely low lows
but this is really irrelevant when seen
in the context of the CPUs intention to
begin with this is a workhorse costing
roughly 1000 USD and it will liberally
consume power as such nonetheless the
Taichi maintained a solid 4.6 gigahertz
overclock as mentioned earlier thanks to
its 13 phase power delivery system and
solid UEFI and I must say this board
also looks pretty sweet I especially
love this cool geared chipset heatsink
and RGB LED array integrated Wi-Fi and
overclock support but the i-9s bad news
does not stop here thanks largely in
part to intel's decision to throw some
choice garbage thermal
between the heat spreader and the dye of
the chip things get very hot this is
typical Intel by this point and it's
pathetic
they crippled their 76 and 77 hundred KS
with the same Tim approach temperatures
reached a staggering 93 degrees in I 264
approaching T Junction where we expect a
bit of thermal throttling at 4.7
gigahertz in the same voltage the CPU
did thermal throttle almost immediately
after starting the test I should point
out that this is due largely important
the CPU itself and my choice to only go
with a 240 ml a IO here not the
motherboard most motherboards will fare
well in this regard just mind your PRM
temperatures all the benchmarks you'll
see in this video will be with the CPU
clock to 4.6 gigahertz where no thermal
throttling occurred the RAM config with
16 gigabytes of course their Dominator
Platinum's running in quad-channel at
3,000 megahertz the frequency which was
effortless for the tight cheese and you
expect that to next to 9:00 9:00 board
the graphics card occupying one of the
board's for full length PCIe slots was a
reference GTX 10 atti from P&amp;amp;Y
running its stock for comparison's sake
I also threw in an i7 6700 K with the
same Ram config just running a dual
channel vs. quad and the same GPU as
well as the same 4.6 gigahertz overclock
so without further ado the benchmarks
first up the center bench r15 scores the
i7 6700 case scored an impressive 1019
despite its 4 physical cores but the I 9
giant demolishes the competition with
2400 242 that's a 140 percent increase
from that of the smaller counterpart and
check out all those threads working
together so well this was pretty cool
feeling right here just watching this
not going to lie but Geekbench for the
gap narrows significantly but the i9
still easily wins over something else -
no - the i7 clock for clock is a
slightly more powerful CP from a single
core standpoint and the 8% increase at
the bottom but at the end of the day who
really cares these are just numbers they
don't mean anything let's throw these
CPUs into a ring in which I'm familiar
that's Adobe Premiere Pro rendering the
same five-minute 1080p 60fps file with
the youtube 1080p preset the i7 finished
in just over 4 minutes whereas the i9
completed the same task in just under 3
now at this point if you ask me
with price taking into consideration
this margin isn't justified the law of
diminishing returns applies this is an
optimize for 10 cores clearly in core
count does matter less and less as you
pass about 4 cores in this case it will
vary from program to program but for the
most part I would say anywhere between 4
and 8 is your safe zone so if you want
something slightly better than the i7
but for the same price as the i7 and go
with Rison 7 the 1700 do you just fine
this isn't a matter of red versus blue
folks I don't care who is on top neither
of them pay me neither of them even talk
to me I just want satisfactory
competition remember don't pay attention
to the company pay attention to what the
company offers so now let's jump into
those gaming benchmarks I tested in
1440p for solid GPU and CPU leveraging
the some would argue that 1080p would be
the better choice here it's more common
by the way I still think that if you're
going to pay a thousand bucks for CPU
you should probably try to bump your
resolution up a bit I think 1440p is
probably the bare minimum for how much
you're likely to spend on this platform
there's a 1080 Ti in here remembers so
graphics card bottlenecking is
relatively minimal these are settings by
the way that I'd expect anyone with this
kind of PC to opt for in the real world
first up on this list as always
GTA 5 this game is beautifully optimized
and leverages a fair amount of both the
central and graphics processors don't
let anyone tell you this game is not a
good port it really is and it utilizes
resources accordingly I benchmark in the
same settings every single time so you
can carry these over to other videos in
the channel as well you'll find averages
here and point 1 percent and 1 percent
Lowe's and I apologize next time I'll
stagger them in descending order not
ascending order across the board the i7
6700 K took the cake with consistent
margins with GTA 5 your sweet spot is
for physical cores anything past that
and well you'll have a few left over for
streaming that's about it
both frame time charts were extremely
consistent - which is good so if a few
spikes here or there which both CPUs
experienced at some point you'd be fine
with either platform in the scenario
likely even when streaming but the cost
of x-29 9 makes it difficult to
rationalize a $1000 CPU and roughly $300
motherboard doom was a similar story
this is the first time I benchmark Doom
by the way even in the ultra preset the
i9 just couldn't keep up these framerate
differences were actually very
consistent with GTA 5
prising lee though doom is slightly more
demanding all around by the way I intend
to run a few Vulcan tests with this game
very soon I love how it leverages
resources and I'd be interested to see
how AMD fares into this mix now let's
compare a physics intensive scenario and
3dmark fire strike most of these
calculations are unloaded on the cpu
predicted pathways particle collisions
explosions all of these we utilize CPU
threads to a solid extent and in this
case the i9 crushes its competition
hands down more cores more frames for
something like this anyway wouldn't it
be nice if all games work this way well
maybe not since most gamers still rely
on two or four physical cores wouldn't
make much sense to cripple a majority in
favor of a minority from a developer
standpoint now what it utilitarianism
for the wind up next is universe sandbox
- I love this game it's beautiful we can
do anything you want practically and it
crushes CPUs click this card right here
for an example of that so how does a 10
core CPU fare well not well actually
worse than the 4 core counterpart which
I find difficult to believe given that
these frequencies were identical hmm
I'll hit up the developers on this one
CPU utilization is fairly high and
consistent across all 20 threads - which
is a good sign more on this in a
separate video
the last benchmark on our list is
Witcher 3 ok this game is extremely GPU
intensive what does that mean it's not
going to matter as much what kind of CPU
we have in our system as long as it's
not some single core processor from 2002
we should be you know ok that's an
exaggeration but you see my point in
switching from an i5 to an i7 to an i9
shouldn't matter too much in this regard
because it's really our GPU that matters
but I spoke too soon the i7 still pulls
ahead here which is strange because the
i5 7600 K actually performs almost as
well in this game as the i7 counterpart
so this is a bit ridiculous if you ask
me sure average frame rates were
neck-and-neck but for the smooth
gameplay 1% and 0.1% lows reveal a
different story
your best bet in this case is without a
doubt the i7 not the i9 again frame time
graphs confirm this of course things
were a bit scattered here for the i7
remember we want smooth lines low on the
y-axis but design 9 my oh my all over
the place and that's where I'm going to
end
video if you're a gamer don't buy the
I&amp;amp;I like I don't know why you would just
to say you have it that's really all I
can conjure from this whole thing is if
you want the i9 to say you've got a 10
core overclockable processor I guess you
can spend a thousand bucks I mean to get
the CPU the benefit of the doubt it is
$600 cheaper than a 69 50 x10 core
processor from the previous generation
so Intel did lower the price
significantly it's worth noting that
still a thousand bucks for CPU
especially in a rig that can be
primarily used for gaming is downright
ridiculous
now if you want to stream go with
horizon at this point better bang for
the buck but this this is just
unacceptable content creators should
also look elsewhere the i7 6700 pay
serves me well but so has to the rise in
1700 X it just comes down to bang to the
buck from what I can see the i9 is not
an option in fact it's just a money pit
it's a hot money pit be sure to give
this video a thumbs up if you thought it
was cool I stayed up all night to make
this video I was running benchmarks like
24/7 it's actually daytime again so if
you have a sympathy thumbs up for me I'd
appreciate it
thumbs down if you feel the complete
office about the whole video or if you
hate everything about life be sure to
subscribe if you haven't already and
I'll catch you in the next video some
super cool stuff just made its way
through the door so stay tuned for that
