we're gonna start things off with
something you've probably seen flooding
your inboxes lately about RGB cables the
next big trend but guys I remember I'm
being serious with you here I really
think these are gonna take off because
they look so freakin good
I know they probably look really good on
camera - I'm trying to show you as
decent a b-roll shot as I can right now
of these cables but in person they look
immaculate they are I can confirm called
the streamers despite their odd spelling
out strimmer or streamer so I think
streamer makes a bit more sense we've
got 24 pin cable here we've got 8 pin
VGA cables 6 pin VGA cables in
production you'll see those soon as well
as a thing EPS up top so you can fully
RGB your main graphics card and
motherboard cables for your next RGB
bill now this is the meat of the Lindley
party this is the land cool one we
teased this a little bit at CES 2018
they were asking for feedback how to
improve this case before it went into
production because of course they want
this to be something that the consumer
wants to buy so you'll find many
improvements with the official landfill
one is when it's dubbed and I'm gonna
start first with just some of the
hardware support you'll find in this
case you have an idea of what you can
potentially build in this beautiful
chassis that comes in between 89 and 99
bucks depending on the options you want
inside so starting with fan and radiator
support of course that's a big option to
consider when purchasing especially a
midsize tower case like this one there
are seven PCI slots at the rear by the
way you can fit up to three 120mm fans
or a 360 mold radiator or whatever you
want to work up front or two 140mm fans
up top same thing you can fit three
120mm fans but not really a radiator
because it's radiator a bit longer than
the fans themselves now Ram clearance if
you're worried about that up top
Jameson did tell me that they were able
to fit Triton Zhi ramen here from
g.skill but if you want something like
team group nighthawk ddr4 because they
have the little fins that stick up
higher on the sides
might be cutting it close so you know
anything Triton Z height or lower should
be fine with the fangrad combo up front
because everything has shifted closer to
the left side of the case a few more
things I want to point out the first is
that you have rubber grommets here on
the right this actually supports up to
e-atx because things are pushed it a
little further right than usual if you
look at some of the competitors the
practical design cases that I've
reviewed this little indention here
which is great for cable management
we'll talk about a second it's pushed a
little further to left which limits you
to just ATX motherboards here full size
EAX not a problem and then up top if
you're interested in support for fans
and whatnot you can access all of that
with this little magnetic clip here so
you can mount your fans here you can of
course mount 140s if you want as well
but only two of those because the case
is not very long in terms of depth but
this is again just a very nice magnetic
clip back on and an integrated dust
filter is included now sliding around
the back this is where things get
especially interesting so only two thumb
screws here you can use Phillips heads
if you want but that's all it takes just
two of them because it does slot in down
below and a cool thing is it's gots a
similar hinge design to what other Leoni
cases have done in the past with you
know your cable management bar at the
right side here though all you got to do
is slide the entire panel into the base
and then it just clips on like that much
easier if you have a lot of cables back
here we all know how difficult it is to
get this panel to slide it in from the
back right because you're pushing all
the cables forward you're not actually
pushing them into the chassis so with
this design here you just smush them all
in if you have a problem with that
though I don't think you will because we
do have again that indention I mentioned
earlier for the front of the case you
can mount SSDs up here if you want or
you can slide these behind the
motherboard tray and then just stuff all
the cables you want if you're about an
inch worth of clearance of two or three
centimeters plenty for case of this
calibre the case also has three large
cutouts
up top so I presume you'd have some you
know fan headers running through here
maybe some RGB cables and whatnot
through the middle
and then of course your eighth in EPS on
the top right good to see all of those
inclusions if we swing the case around
again and over doing a full 360 here but
I want to give you guys the rundown of
this case as much as possible about
actually building it and giving you an
official review upfront here this is
actually aluminum and it has been cnc'd
all the way around so it looks beautiful
we get that like chrome and I finished
around the edges really like that going
back to the roots there with the
aluminum touch the other big thing that
you'll get in the $99 edition if you
look up top here we have front io just
kind of tilt the case forward probably
be a little better to see we have type C
on the far left we have the hard drive
LED indicator here we have the LED
button that controls the RGB s at the
front of the case a power button USB I
think these are going to be 3.0 and then
we have headphone jack microphone jack
and then there's another USB 3.0 port on
the far right so again the type C port
is included in the $99 Edition you
forego that in the $89 one in my opinion
you should pay the extra 10 bucks you
get the addressable RGB LEDs and you get
type C so if you want to stay up to date
this is a you know this is a new thing
everyone's so worried about here it is
and then under $9 land cool
now I'm sure you all remember the O 11
air and improvement upon the original PC
o 11 and I actually built my first
custom loop in you also probably know
about the O 11 dynamic by now built one
of my custom loops in that case the
white version I have the black one
sitting in the studio now this is the
final revision of the 11 air and I think
it looks even better than it did at CES
again you have the same simple
mechanisms to remove and reinstall those
side panels the top panel the front
panel all completely toolless it's a
beautiful design I'm glad they stuck
with it and I want to see this in cases
from all manufacturers frankly I think
we only is leading the way here and if
you are not familiar with the dynamic or
the air things are pretty pretty unique
in here you got the PSU going on the
back side behind the motherboard tray
you can mount three 120mm fans here
three 120 here three 120 here and three
120 here so what a total of 12 120mm
fans and you can also fit
all these slots as well together I think
you can you probably I don't know if you
can fit a radiator here and here all to
ask about that you might not be able to
put them side-by-side but I know you can
do at least one on top one on bottom and
one at the back so if you want to just
you know check this case with rads and
fans you can certainly do it plenty of
space in here plenty of airflow a big
topic especially in 2017 with airflow
this case prioritizes it
thanks to that kind of grill mesh front
panel and if you're wondering this one -
oh no this one's screwed in okay maybe
this one doesn't remove the same way but
two simple screws on top here slide it
off you have access to the front you
want to install fans or rides up front
certainly possible and again on the back
side of the case you want to remove the
right side panel plenty of space back
there as well for just tons of cables
you can be absolutely ludicrous with
your cable management not care really
much about anything back here although I
don't recommend you do that and still
have room to spare because of the way
this case is designed now this table
here it doesn't have a name yet but it
is self raising according to the menu up
front there it's adjustable with
built-in motors beautiful tempered glass
with a very nice metallic frame supports
up to 80 kilograms I could sit on this
thing actually more than me it sit on
this thing you can build an entire PC
inside of it show it off to all your
friends I really want one of these just
to build on I think we'd be a great like
b-roll table and build table present do
it just this but I think it looks sexy
on camera and here's the best kicker it
only costs apparently
nine hundred ninety nine dollars which I
find hard to believe because some IKEA
self-raising desks are about the same
price so if that's the case I actually
think they're gonna sell a lot of these
despite being a thousand dollar table
it's one of the best value thousand
dollar tables I've ever seen now we're
going to end things here at the Leonie
booth here at Computex 2018 with the O
11th dynamic revision in a partnership
of sorts with razor I talked about the
equal video how I like seeing companies
work together and this is this is
Nirvana folks this looks so good I
already love the way the dynamic looked
to begin with and I love what Razer has
done what they've included working with
Lee and Lee here to make it just RGB if
I'd even more you guys know Razer chroma
their keyboards and peripherals headset
all that it's all RGB synced and you can
use Razer synapse software to control
these RGB LEDs both shining through here
which you'll see on the left side of the
tempered glass up front and underneath
to give it a subtle glow on the bottom
really crisp looks great I love it when
sync with all the other RGB stuff we've
got in the case and again you don't want
RGB change it to whatever you want
that's the joy of RGB I know it gets old
seeing this stuff over and over but it
looks clean if you set it to the color
profile you want that's all finale and
leave with your computex 2018 stay tuned
for the rest of our coverage couple more
days worth of hunting finding booths
finding Suites and checking out the new
tech this is science studio thanks for
traveling with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
