outperform Intel's modern I five lineup
in modern gaming it's a bold statement
but it will not happen here's a short
and sweet explanation as to why AMD's
already confirmed rise in five
specifications consisting of two cc axes
or clusters of four rise of course what
this means since we know the five series
will only have six and four core
variants is that one or two cores but
then each complex will be turned off
essentially think of these as cores that
didn't pass the mark but what this also
means is that these Rison five CPUs are
essentially rising seven CPUs from an
architectural standpoint this is bad
news for gamers who were looking for i5
and i7 counterparts on the red team
since I PC isn't expected to change much
at all you see most games utilise
anywhere from two to four cores with
very few going beyond to that data field
one is a very rare exception but horizon
7 couldn't even keep up there Andy tried
to make it seem as though the 1800 X 2
the chance at this event here but at 4k
which was the resolution of choice CPU
load is dramatically reduced you'll find
that as we approach 1080p the eight core
Intel equivalent takes the cake just
barely and that's not to take away from
the price of performance benefit of
horizon 7 but the point I'm trying to
make is that how on earth is it supposed
to beat an even higher tally to Kaiba
lake CPU I'm talking specifically about
the i7 7700 K but you're more than
welcome to extrapolate this through
overclockable high-fives from Katie and
Skye families as well remember IPC is a
big deal she asked me what I've seen so
far my own tests and just test from
others that I do trust the 1600 X will
fall in line somewhere around a locked I
5 from Intel cable 8 now I know that
sounds too bad to be true and then a lot
of the AMD fans are just going to
automatically dislike the video because
I just said what I just said but it's
the truth and you're going to find that
out once you start seeing these rise and
5 benchmarks roll out let me show you a
few examples
first up GTA 5 you can see in 1440p very
high settings how things are fairly
close the 6700 K edges out and narrow
win but drop to 1080p and that lead
dramatically improves this is the nature
of CPU scaling at lower resolutions the
chips with stronger individual cores
will pull forward all other things equal
now let's throw the 7600 K into the mix
just a fork or four thread CPU boom
still considerably higher frame rate
than the 1700 X in 1080p and this is
with all eight cores enabled I'm
emphasizing the 1080p resolution because
it's by far the most common resolution
in which people game today even Witcher
3 which heavily leverages the graphics
card favored ever-so-slightly these 6700
K I don't have a 7700 K in case you're
wondering - not worth the upgrade from a
67 if you already have one but you'll
see an extra few frames here and there
with a newer architecture - only further
my point now let's play devil's advocate
here for a second can't you overclock
just a bit more CPUs with fewer course
isn't it easier to overclock to course
VPS and it is overclocked for course VPS
the answer in general is yes you
actually can and in some cases you can
turn off cores and say your 5820k or
even a sixty nine hundred K overclock
that CPU just a bit more and edge out a
few extra frames it sounds
counterintuitive but that is how it
works in some cases but I must say it
was very difficult pushing the 1700 X
anywhere above four gigahertz even with
four of its eight cores disabled running
the latest bios the 1600 x is the only
cpu in the risin 5 line up shipping with
it out of the box frequency of 4
gigahertz which is pretty ballsy if you
ask me but I still wouldn't count on
moving it much past that so why am I
telling you this
especially given the hostility in this
space I'm trying to dehydrate and
without breaking any NDA which would be
impossible because I didn't sign
anything and I don't have any risin 5
CPU on me and I don't think anybody has
at this point and that's why you're
seeing so many we have rise inside
benchmarks even though they haven't been
released yet it's because you can
actually simulate rise on 5 CPUs with
risin 7 chips by the activating course
they are essentially the exact same
thing the exact same dies are being used
but cores are being turned off it didn't
pass the mark the hype is what many use
to crush the momentum risin 7 hat even
though those CPUs were never intended
for gaming nobody buys an 8 core 16
thread CPU solely for gaming period
risin 5 will likely offer better value
chips in the gaming space but don't
count on any of them to outperform a
comparably priced Intel i5 in modern
games it'll be close but it won't you
know won't be a blowout if you
want my two cents the 1600 seems like a
great buy for those concerns with
content creation and gaming on a budget
while the 1500 X is sure to convince
many of those solely interested in
gaming regardless of the resolution look
I have no doubt that risin 5 will be a
huge success I want it to be I want
competition I want to have a tough time
choosing between an Intel and an AMD CPU
for the first time in my PC building
career I want that tough decision the
value is insane it's been AMD strong
suit for quite a while but I
wholeheartedly oppose the idea that
rising 5 will stop the blue team
competition at the same price point in
modern games I only expect that they'll
be very close but still its competition
if you liked this video be sure to give
it a thumbs up thumbs down if you think
I'm a paid off Intel shill well I like
to dislike ratio that varies a bit more
than usual is actually pretty good for
YouTube algorithms so you're actually
doing me a solid there be sure to click
