but does that make it a full name change
or just a halfway name change first the
first word was replaced we discussed
this extensively on Twitter I dropped
the word science because not everything
I do on this channel involves it to any
substantial degree and I feel miss
characterizes the direction we're headed
don't worry most of what we cover will
still remain technology it's my favorite
thing after all so I don't know why I
would leave that but I don't want to be
limited towards like science or tech so
if I want to upload something that
really has nothing to do with either of
them but I think would be pretty cool
for all of you to see I don't want to
feel I guess held back by any particular
channel name and that's why what with my
last name Salazar is my last name so it
just kind of is all-encompassing that's
that's what I usually use to describe
the name change to people who are a bit
questionable about it I know I'm going
to have some people ranting in the
comments about or your name change you
know another another tech tuber changing
his name but look it could be worse okay
you know exactly where I'm going with
this another announcement the winner of
the custom white asus strix
rog gtx 1070 from walter white version
1.0 was said Torres a fan from
Guadalajara Mexico
congratulations mr. Torres you will have
your graphics card at some point
hopefully within the next few weeks now
to the topic of this video the asus
toughs sabertooth z1 70s motherboard i'm
reviewing this one because many have
requested it like literally you won't
wanted me to give it to you and this is
clearly a beautiful board packed with
features let's start off with that
alluring white silver PCB it has no
functional purpose other than to make
the board look gorgeous
it's one of only a select a number of
boards sporting this color scheme and is
also reasonably priced at that it's
splattered with an army winter
camouflage theme I don't personally mind
it although it wouldn't be bad to have
an all-white PC me either and then the
back is also almost completely white in
case you were wondering every now and
then you'll find a hub that's painted
tan I don't know how that fits with the
color scheme but at least it's not
overdone the 24-pin is tan the ape and
eps up top is tan and then the two USB
3.0 hubs are there's also a fan of a
pitot span but you probably won't notice
that there's also a hint of metallic
silver lingering over the power phases
there are twelve of those by the way
MOSFET heat sinks and chipset he
the saber-tooth is covered by a large
z170 s logo followed by a subdued a soos
on the bottom do you keep in mind that
much of this will likely be covered by
your graphics card but it's a nice
aesthetic nonetheless me Rio is shielded
by an off-white plastic housing with the
words tough if that's how you pronounce
it - UF and saber-tooth line along the
edges and a shield bird further down is
that what is that right a shield bird
it's a shield with wings so yeah I'm
gonna go with shield bird so how about
functionality let's stick with the rear
i/o for a second where we find a
plethora of options starting from the
top four USB 2.0 ports a fifth and just
below a BIOS reset switch great for
overclocking HDMI 1.4 and DisplayPort
ports I guess two USB 3.0 s a Gigabit
LAN controller a USB 3.1 in type-c ports
and 7.1 surround sound as well as
optical support you can also cram a 40
millimeter vrm mosfet fan right here if
you're a bit nervous about on-board
temperatures one is not included but you
likely won't need it to my surprise the
chips that heatsink is also fitted with
the kind of led notification hub great
for diagnosing issues with your PC and
checking on current status think of it
like a doctor debug without all the
confusing number codes each LED is
extremely bright as well so you
definitely won't miss anything out of
the ordinary to the left of the chipset
you'll find three full-length PCIe slots
and three x1 slots only this one
supports a full 16 lanes so this is the
ideal slot for a single graphics card if
you intend on SLI or crossfire on - of
any card both of which are supported by
this motherboard you'll be running each
with eight lanes now let's count fan
hubs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 that's
right 11 van hubs granted one is just an
assistant fan hub without PWM support so
fine 10 that's more than most
motherboard support and should eliminate
the need for a third party fan hub this
board also supports up to 64 gigabytes
of ddr4 non-ecc of course this isn't a
server motherboard and dual-channel
architecture for frequencies up to 2400
megahertz
I've installed 4 4 gigabyte DIMMs here
from team force these modules are
gorgeous and relatively inexpensive
rated for up to 3,000 megahertz you can
find these in the
video's description as for overclocking
this one's a beast as you might expect I
could reach 4.8 gigahertz without
hiccups apart from relatively unnerving
thermals around 90 C but this is a
function of the CPU and cooler not
necessarily the motherboard MOSFET and
vrm temperatures remain satisfactory and
the overclock was stable although I did
ultimately tune things back a bit for
the sake of the CPU the BIOS is also a
pleasant surprise very easy to navigate
through and void of any freezes or
glitches which I cannot say for certain
competitors
so in closing do I recommend this
motherboard even with price taken into
consideration yes 100% it's beautiful
and functional and comes with pretty
much anything you could possibly imagine
as e170 motherboard packing I purchased
this one with my own money and I would
do it again in a heartbeat when I should
mention it'll look great in any black or
white case in particular but especially
walter white and all for a great deal
less than 200 US dollars
its link is in this video subscription
check it out and let me know what you
think if you liked this video be sure to
give it a thumbs up give it a thumbs
down if you do feel the complete
opposite or if you hate everything about
life be sure to click Subscribe any
hammer and stay tuned for another future
PC build and I guess Walter White a
version 2.1 I got to upgrade this thing
again it's having so many issues I don't
know what's going on z170 Walter White
was beautiful version 1.0 was just a
perfect flawless build but for some
reason now that I've moved it to x99 I
keep having issues from the power supply
to the graphics card SLI configuration
not getting the full frame rate I expect
and it's it's a long story I'll talk
about it more in detail later also I'm
gonna be uploading a video as to why I
change from the 10 core Xeon to the 8
core 6900 K that's it should be pretty
obvious why I did but I'll explain in
more detail the things that I noticed
with the grand reduction in frequency
this is Salazar studio you still learn
with me so I'm still gonna say it thanks
for learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
