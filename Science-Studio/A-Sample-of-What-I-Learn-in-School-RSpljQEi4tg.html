like I always do and found at the New
Zealand experienced a rather powerful
earthquake a magnitude 7.8 which is
bound to be revised just a little bit
these aren't exact Sciences so what our
earth quakes and why do they happen I'm
a petroleum engineering major here at ul
but I've taken about five or six geology
courses they kind of go hand in hand
we're gonna be drilling into the earth
so we better know how the earth works
and what we're drilling into but geology
courses have been my favorite courses by
far here at my University and that's
kind of what I want to pay tribute to in
this video I know I talk a lot about
computers in this channel but I want to
diversify my portfolio a little bit and
discuss something a little off topic if
you will give it a chance this is minute
science we're gonna try to tackle the
subject and all around three minutes so
our earth is very much alive and active
it has three distinct layers the crust
the mantle and the core the core is
divided into two sub layers the outer
core which is comprised of a liquid iron
and nickel and the inner core which is a
solid iron and nickel the outer core
spins around the inner core and produces
a magnetic field that shields us from
solar radiation as for the mantle common
misconception I actually believe is for
the longest time the mantle is not
comprised of a liquid it's not just
magma it's actually most of it is a
solid rock that behaves plastically
because it's under intense pressures and
heat and on top we have the Earth's
crust of course it's what we live on
it's very brittle it doesn't move slowly
over time like the mantle does it moves
very quickly in short amounts of time
that right there earthquakes earthquakes
occur in the crust not in the mantle but
the mantle influences where earthquakes
occur and how frequently they occur take
the Ring of Fire for example the Pacific
Rim is constantly subducting under very
light continental crust it's comprised
mainly of granite whereas ocean crust is
comprised more of gabbro basalts much
denser so it sinks when it's pushed
against something that's much lighter
another example the entire western
seaboard of south america is considered
a subduction zone because the Nazca
plate off to its West is subducting
underneath the light granitic crust
comprising the South American plate
remember denser crust sinks that's how
gravity works as this dense crust
reaches the upper layers of the mantle
what we call the asthenosphere it
partially melts rises to the surface and
creates volcanoes and what we call the
Andes Mountains the Nazca plate is one
of the fastest moving tectonic plates on
earth moving at roughly 3 to 4
centimeters per year and I mean picture
that doesn't sound like a lot of
movement right but that's an entire slab
of Earth
moving that far every year in a decade
or a century it definitely adds up it
also builds up a lot of static friction
remember the crust is not as ductile and
malleable as the mantle is so it builds
up a lot of tension over time and then
snaps instantly and those snaps are what
produce earthquakes so after a prolonged
buildup of static friction over time
that coefficient will be overcome and
several earthquakes will occur around
that zone of movement so there are
essentially two mechanisms driving
earthquake forces here on earth and they
go hand-in-hand
the first is convection the mantle is
constantly moving even though it's not a
liquid it's still moving it rises when
it partially melts and it sinks when it
solidifies so the mantle picture moving
up and down it's moving down into the
outer core where it's much hotter that
rock melts and then Rises because it
becomes less dense and then as it
solidifies it becomes more dense and
begins to sink back down again okay
those convection forces occurring in the
mantle move the crust above it now if
the crust behave like the mantle did we
wouldn't have earthquakes per se because
the crust would just stretch and move in
response to the forces acting underneath
it but the crust is stubborn and brittle
and often refuses to budge unless severe
forces act on it over a prolonged amount
of time building of stress and that
coefficient of static friction at this
point the crust gives in and slips along
a fault line or plate boundary resulting
in one severe earthquake followed by
several aftershocks which is kind of
just that plate settling into its new
position hopefully you'll learn
something from this video or at least
enjoy the topic let me know if you want
to see more videos like this or if I
should move on to something else
entirely this is Salazar studio thanks
for learning with this
