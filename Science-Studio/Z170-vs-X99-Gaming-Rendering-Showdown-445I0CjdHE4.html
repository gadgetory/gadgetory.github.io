for your next video editing and gaming
PC you're probably deciding at this
point between the i7 5820k or ATS 6800 k
Broadway counterpart or the i7 6700 K or
it's KB Lake 7700 K counterpart for the
record is 7700 K isn't much of an
improvement over its skylake counterpart
nor is the 6800 K over its haswell-e
counterpart these newer CPUs have almost
identical IPC gains over their inferiors
and won't alter your frame rates by any
substantial amount clock for clock so
this video will attempt to tackle both
the gaming and editing / or rendering
sides of the equation this should be
rather black-and-white for those
interested in only playing video games
but there are a few exceptions worth
mentioning and while content creators
tend to focus on core counts over clock
speeds optimization is key let's start
off first with the latter the 5820k
seems like an obvious choice here 6
cores 12 threads excellent overclocking
Headroom but at the expense of well a
greater expense not always but you can
usually build on a comparable z170
platform for a few bucks less on a good
day a 5820k will set you back around 300
to 340 u.s. dollars the same can be said
of the 6700 K although x99 motherboards
yep that's where they get you are
anywhere from fifty to a hundred bucks
more expensive on average and that price
can go up to upwards of 400 to 500
dollars that's insane for a motherboard
but that's what you get with the x99
chipset but if price isn't a concern it
should just come down to which CPU
performs better in any particular task
in this case rendering and gaming so
we're going to look at right now we'd
expect based on synthetic workload tests
that at 4.6 gigahertz
each the 5820k would have a slight edge
it's technically 25% faster clock for
clock including all of its cores but
that won't matter if the programming
question isn't properly optimized to
handle six physical cores Adobe Premiere
is no exception and that's the program
that I use it's the one that a lot of
professionals use and that's why I use
it when I benchmark CDs like this for
content creation you're looking at a 6.5
percent difference in rendering times
and in case you're wondering tacking on
an additional two cores and four threads
the $1,000 6900 k yields similar margins
yeah I was let down to say the least
Puget systems reveals a wide array of
tests showing how the law of diminishing
returns plays a huge role past for
course for this program I have a link to
this article in the video description to
check it out for more details your
results will vary depending on your
program of choice for example DaVinci
Resolve tends to be more GPU dependent
and something like After Effects heavily
relies on clock speed in general but as
a rule of thumb more cores isn't always
better
which is why I've stayed away from
Zeon's in this video I know not everyone
will agree with me but if you want my
two cents I say the 6700 K is the winner
of the content creation realm it's just
the all-around best bang for the buck
CPU out there for rendering for editing
for content creation in general if
you're using something like Adobe
Premiere to edit and upload videos sure
you could spend over $1000 for
marginally better performance no one is
arguing that those CPUs are better at
their jobs but from a price to
performance standpoint you'd be crazy to
do so for strictly this purpose multi
multi-core CPUs are designed for
entirely different workloads and
programs that take full advantage of the
horsepower taking a step back here's a
bare-bones i7 editing rig build list for
anyone interested as you can see a cheap
motherboard and modest power supply are
key when it comes to keeping the price
down no need to spend 200 plus US
dollars on a z17 years√≠ 270 motherboard
no need to spend 200 plus dollars on a
power supply when a $100 power supply
would do the job just fine these parts
are linked in the video's description by
the way let me know what you think now
on to gaming already have a video here
explaining the relevance of core i7s in
the gaming sphere it's a tricky subject
only because people are always looking
so far ahead and using the term
future-proof but right up front it is
difficult to justify one in the context
of most modern titles battlefield one
among the few exceptions but if you're
considering an i7 for the purpose of
future proofing your brand-new PC
straight up the 6700 K again is the way
to go consider GTA 5 first here's a
great balance of CPU and GPU horsepower
at work and a resolution that severely
tugs on neither component with
equivalent specifications across the
board save the CPU and of course the
motherboard the 6700 K
fools ahead ever so slightly the most
noticeable difference is in the minimums
both runs of this benchmark we're smooth
and uninterrupted and it's unlikely
you'd be able to distinguish between the
two but a wins a win and that's all
we're going by here City skylines up
next leverages three cores heavily
verified here and because of this gives
the point to the 6700 K the skylake cpu
stronger single core performance plays a
huge role here and the fact that the
game isn't optimized for anything above
three cores really doesn't give an edge
to the 5820k when games aren't optimized
for more cores that are offered by the
CPU at hand
primary limiting factors will be
frequency and core strength instructions
per clock is an attempt to measure these
variables quite the opposite of GTA v
which is kind of weird cities yields
identical minimums and a 5 FPS disparity
on average again still smooth gameplay
you won't be able to tell the difference
these are i7s we're talking about but 5
FPS is 5 fps another win for the 6700 K
now let's change it up a bit
Counter Strike global Offensive csgo
this one surprised me looking at FPS
disparities in the 20s across the board
signaling an interesting shift in game
optimization these are very high frame
rate so our CPUs are being heavily
leveraged perhaps explaining the
difference for extra threads and go a
long way for a few games speaking of a
few I'm sure you're wondering how
battlefield one turned out quite like
you might expect actually thanks to the
six cores in the 5820k in 1440p we see
80 vs. 84-68 474 a definite win for the
5820k it's a hot topic right now
forecasting CPU usage for triple-a
titles to be released in the future is
higher core count gaming the trend of
the future do you expect these frame
rates to shift nonlinearly as resolution
changes by the way and 1080p expect the
50 20 KS lead to increase and in 4k
expect it to diminish as GPU usage
increases but let's not get carried away
I can count probably on one hand a
number of games that successfully
utilize more than 4 physical cores it's
why I 5s are so dang popular in the
gaming community streaming and
multitasking are another matter
I had several videos on the subject but
for now this battlefield 1 benchmark
does not represent a majority of the
scenarios you'll encounter
so let's end with Witcher 3 it's a GPU
hungry game and limiting ourselves to a
single 1070 definitely affects things
here let's try our best to dissect this
one first up the i7 6700 k1 the minimum
category in the 5820k when the average
category so what does this mean
from the standpoint of the CPU not much
the graphics card is what's being abused
here I reran this benchmark to show you
see now the 5820k wins the minimum
category in the 6700 K the average I
imagine if I kept running this benchmark
over and over which I won't do because
it's very time consuming these scores
would just continue to flip-flop back
and forth when your GPU bound anything
goes the tiniest of stalls can result in
substantial frame rendering delays
substantial and processing terms
affecting frame rates and unpredictable
ways when it comes to CPUs we can limit
background processes and rearrange
orders of operation through tools like
the task manager but with graphics cards
it's completely different software
revisions for example can lead to
drastic performance impacts when it
comes to graphics cards many of which
are unpredictable and difficult to
isolate nonetheless I'm calling this
want to draw thanks to the nature of
which are three and it's GPU bound
behavior so you've seen how there are
several several variables to consider
there is no black and white answer not
when it comes to these two CPUs right
here there's no black and white answer
as to which processor is better for
gaming nor content creation for that
matter because program optimization is
difficult to quantify what I can say is
that both are fine for both just
straight-up price aside it comes down to
which you'd rather invest in what your
upgrade paths look like five years from
now what graphics card or card you're
using keep PCIe lanes in the back of
your mind as well but if you want my
answer my personal just stance on this
whole issue I'm making a secret about
this having gamed and edited on both for
several months the 6700 K but the decent
overclock is the surefire way to go or
the 7700 K just keep interchanging those
whichever is cheaper at that point in
time not much change from 67 to 77 so
don't upgrade if you were thinking about
doing that they're all great CPUs and
will last you a long time I don't like
using the term future proofing but
whatever yes I 7s are more future proof
than I 5s it's kind of obvious why but
are you willing to put your money
your mouth is that is the question hop
