detailing the performance differences
between a core i5 and a core i7 now they
were from the house well line up not the
skylake lineup but that's besides the
point if you interested in that video
you can check it out in the card above
me in the case of skylight their
fundamental differences haven't changed
the core i5 6600 K still packs four
cores and four threads which means that
we don't have hyper threading on this
processor and it over clocks about the
same as this 6700 K it's fork or a
thread counterpart what I did in this
video was overclock both the i7 and the
i-5 to 4.6 gigahertz throw them into the
rig behind me featuring 16 gigabytes of
3,000 megahertz ddr4 and an AMD r9 390
and then run a series of rendering tests
via Adobe Premiere Pro I ran 4 tests
with both processors for a total of 8
and I changed one variable during each
run using my Moto X pure which I can
make a review about if you're more
interested in it's only 300 bucks and I
get a 1440p screen Snapdragon 808
hexa-core processor it's a nice phone if
you want to see review let me know but I
used this phone to film both a 1080p
one-minute clip and a 4k one-minute clip
both at 30fps
using Premiere Pro I made sure that both
clips were trimmed to exactly one minute
and then I took the 1080p clip and
simply exported it using the YouTube
1080p preset which you can find under
the h.264 format I then took this same
1080p clip and then up sampled it to the
YouTube 4k preset then moving on to the
4k clip I rendered it as was using the
YouTube 4k preset and then ran the test
one more time down sampling that clip to
1080p keep in mind I do this with both
the i7 and the i-5 so we'll have a total
of 8 tests the only two other boxes that
I selected under the export window or
the use maximum render quality box and
the render and maximum death box which I
use all the time I use them for all of
my videos that I upload so with that
let's see how well the i-5 compares to
the i7
the results were as expected the i7 is
the content creator King from Intel and
I do recommend this processor for anyone
who does any sort of content creation
whether it be video audio photo you get
the point
the percent rendering time decrease
between all four graphs was almost
exactly 47% meaning that if you were to
upgrade from this I five to this i7 and
keep everything else in your rig exactly
the same you should expect to see
somewhere around a 50% rendering time
cut as a result using the Xeon e3 1230
v5 and overclocking that to 4.6
gigahertz would give you almost
identical results to this i7 by the way
if you're interested in how to overclock
that Xeon in particular you can check
out the card above me so I know that
nothing was essentially discovered in
this video I mean you should expect an
i7 with hyper-threading to perform much
better than its non hyper-threaded
counterpart but I feel like reiterating
this point because a lot of you are
asking me the differences between the i5
and i7 when it comes to content creation
because as you saw in the car that I
flashed earlier the differences between
the i5 and i7 when it came to gaming
performance the the change between the
two wasn't all that great when it came
to frame rates that you saw in most
games however if you do a lot of content
creation even if you play games on the
side but you still upload videos to
YouTube or twitch or anything like that
I definitely recommend the i7 simply
because you're gonna be able to edit and
render all of your clips much easier
you're not going to have that rough
scrubbing if you you know are sliding
between clips the i5 experienced a bit
of that but the i7 it was super fluid
with ten before k is a lot harder for
any processor to handle and in that case
may be is Xeon or something like a 5820k
you would benefit from those added
threads but for just general content
creation and 1080p maybe even 1440p if
you're into that the i7 6700 K is my
recommendation if you're wondering where
the gaming benchmarks are for this newly
built rig don't worry those are on the
way
I might even include the i-5 in those
tests just to show that there isn't
going to be much of a difference in most
games DirectX 12 being an exception
sometimes it depends on the game and
optimization it gets pretty complicated
but the cool thing is that I have an r9
390 in this rig and I haven't made a
video covering this graphics card yet so
it'll be interesting to see how well
this card fares with an i7 considering
that no cpu bottleneck should
exist at all AMD is also sending their
RX 480 so we'll do a head head between
that card and this one and I'm going to
see if they'll send me a second ones
that we can crossfire them and compare
that cross fired combo with a single GTX
1080 which actually cost more ultimately
I think that the the cross fired combo
has has a chance folks stay tuned for
that
this is oh wait no I just skip the whole
part yeah give the video a thumbs up if
you liked it give it a thumbs down if
you felt they played opposite or if you
hate everything about life stay tuned
for a PC build and also all of this
other stuff I'm not going to run through
all that again because you guys don't
have short-term memory loss I hope this
is sign studio thanks for learning with
us
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
