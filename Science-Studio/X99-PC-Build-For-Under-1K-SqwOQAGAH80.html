and it doesn't matter if you're watching
this video immediately after it's been
published or three or four years into
the future I want you to tell me in the
comments what first comes to mind when I
say the next phrase x99 got it okay tell
me in the comments what you first
thought of when I said that for me
personally x99 means expensive its
enthusiast grade right so Intel
delegates that specific platform for
people who aren't afraid to spend extra
dough but what if I told you you could
put together an enthusiasts grade PC for
under $1,000 would you think I was crazy
I thought I was crazy too until I
actually looked at the PC port picker
list that I put together and I was a
little shocked now there were a few
compromises I had to make but they're
not substantial the video card obviously
was something we had to cut back on just
because our processor alone was a little
over a third of the entire PC price but
that's okay I mean that's something that
if you you know just wanted to have a
powerful processor for video editing or
something along those lines then you
would be fine with the rig that we have
here so let's go ahead and run through
the parts that are selected in this
particular list and maybe we can pick up
some things that you might be able to
change first up in our list is the Intel
i7 5820k and I say obviously because
well it's by far the cheapest processor
you can buy for the x99 platform the
next step up would be the 59 30k you're
paying around 200 ollars more for a
processor that only gives you a few
extra PCIe lanes and in a $1000 PC build
budget really don't have room for SLI or
crossfire even though there's not really
words really can't do any of that with
this budget so I would only advocate for
the 59 30k if you plan on doing some
pretty hard core SLI or crossfire again
I said it again those aren't words but
just you know what I mean the 5820k has
six solid 22 nanometer cores and twelve
threads thanks to hyper threading I
wouldn't recommend the CPU solely for
gamers I think it's steered more towards
the editor and maybe the person who
streams in 1080 or 1440p the CPU would
be would be more ideal for you but if
you're just a gamer then you could
pretty much just disregard this entire
setup this is this is just you know what
if if you had $1,000 you wanted to spend
on something that you think would be
useful
for you you're an editor or if you're a
game streamer this CPU would would come
highly recommended here in the studio
the processor itself however does not
come with a cooler and that's why we've
chosen the hyper 212 Evo to cool things
down a bit at only $28 and you know its
ability to allow for a decent overclock
the hyper 212 Evo is pretty much a
no-brainer in this case now onto the
motherboard things can get pretty
expensive when it comes to x99
motherboards so that made our job fairly
simple just find the cheapest one that
had all the features we wanted we wanted
an ATX sized motherboard and that's what
we got here we didn't want a micro ATX
or even that asrock ITX motherboard for
the x99 platform just because if you're
buying an enthusiast grade chip you want
to have more than one PCIe Lane even
micro ATX yeah but the 5820k that'll be
just fine but if you ever plan on buying
I don't know like a 59 60 X and you want
those extra PCIe lanes you're gonna want
this extra PCIe slots as well to be able
to do you know three and four-way
crossfire or something ridiculous like
that so that option is available to you
if you decide to go this venture and
besides I think this is actually cheaper
than any micro or ITX motherboard out
there anyway so we get full size and we
get the lowest price that's pretty nice
up next is RAM our CPU takes advantage
of ddr4 in quad channel so that pretty
much forces us to buy four separate dims
and not to dims that we would normally
buy in any regular platform I say
regular but you know what I mean so ddr4
and we chose some Geils super loose I
don't know if it's called dealer
jean-guy OGE ion whatever you can look
it up on the PC port bigger list but
they're white dims and they actually
have LEDs in them so that's pretty cool
now $74.99 and you're getting 16
gigabytes which is pretty much the bare
minimum that I would recommend for an X
99 platform up next is storage and a
data is 120 gigabyte solid state drive
is pretty much a no-brainer for me I
purchased one of these for practically
every build I put together and they've
all been very reliable having had a
single problem with one yet so until
that day comes I will continue to
prioritize my SSDs with a data up there
near the top we've also gone with a one
terabyte Western Digital caviar blue
hard disk drive for general storage
because Western Digital is the way to go
when it comes to hard drives and one
terabyte should be plenty for
most of your movies and clips and some
games as well some fairly large games
like GTA 5 it's very large game up next
is the video card and this is where I
said that we did have to compromise a
bit in order to keep the total price
below $1,000 and we've gone with the
Sapphire Radeon r9 380 for gigabyte
graphics card if you plan on you know
scaling things up a lot maxing out your
games and 1080p you're gonna want that
for gigs of vram and this card will
definitely be able to take it all on
without any problem so that's what we
chosen for the video card of course you
can completely just swap this card out
for whatever you'd like I personally I
would recommend a GTX 970 at least or an
r9 390 at least in this particular rig
just because your CPUs not gonna
bottleneck anything that you throw out
unless you do something crazy like 3 or
4 Way SLI gtx 980ti s or something but
for my budget conscious consumers out
there this rig should be just fine but
if you got the extra $100 I do recommend
an r9 390 or a GTX 970 up last on our
list well apart from the case is the
power supply and we've chosen an EVGA
600 watt 80 plus bronze power supply for
this particular rig I have used these in
the past they are very reliable and very
quiet you won't be disappointed
600 Watts will be more than plenty for
this PC even under full load now back to
the case for a second I have noticed
that when most people put together some
pretty expensive rigs and they want to
keep it under a certain price point they
compromise on the case because they say
well that's completely subjective so I'm
just gonna put a pretty cheap case on
there that way I can keep my price below
my target well nay not for me I have
chosen a fractal define s because I'm a
baller and I was able to keep the price
under $1,000 even with this relatively
expensive case so yeah you could buy
something like this you could buy
something like an NZXT s340 which may
even be in the list later on if the
price for the fractal design s goes up
but you can interchange that you have
plenty of room for a decent case and
that's what I wanted to make sure was
available to you all if you decided to
put together any particular rig that
looked similar to this I know you can't
see the TV because it's pretty it's
pretty bright but yeah the reboot you're
looking at right now you could swap any
case out for any other case that's
relatively expensive and you're gonna be
a-ok there so you're welcome
for my sis here in the studio for this
particular rig so with all that being
said be sure to let me know in the
comments below if you even think that an
X in the 9 base trig is even viable
anymore especially considering the fact
that the 6700 K from Sky Lake is out and
rivals for the most part the 5820k in
most tasks be sure to LIKE the video if
you liked it dislike it for whatever
reason if you disliked it and let me
know in the comments below what you
would like to see in the future
this is science studio thanks for
