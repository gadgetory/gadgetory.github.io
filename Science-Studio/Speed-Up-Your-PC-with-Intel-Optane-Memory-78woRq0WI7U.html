cheap and SSDs are much more expensive
per gig it's difficult to find a middle
ground of course we all want fast
storage boot times and even game load
times are dramatically reduced from
making the transition from hard disks to
flash storage but even just a 240 gig
SSD cost nearly 100 US dollars so here's
a solution pairing a one terabyte hard
disk drive or there abouts plenty of
storage for games and movies with Intel
obtain memory in a nutshell Intel
obtained memory is not RAM and not an
SSD instead this proprietary technology
is designed on the consumer level to
eliminate the latency hard drives
induced when loading up an operating
system or a video game let's say in a
partnership with Intel we've been
provided a beautiful Alienware Aurora r7
packed with a coffee lake core i7 CPU
gtx 1070 and of course until obtain
memory in combination with a 2 terabyte
hard disk drive if you're gonna buy
pre-built this is the way to go it isn't
inundated with ridiculous and branding
of any kind say if the supercooled
Alienware power button and doesn't cost
much more pre-built than and what if you
decided to build it yourself with octane
activated within our BIOS and in the
system we're looking at a 10 second boot
time this is literally SSD performance
without obtain activated nearly one
minute to boot up the exact same PC to
open up steam right after signing in our
octane powered system took 18 seconds
that's compared to 53 without obtain
activated again not exaggerating these
numbers already says multiple times
literally identical times throughout
these runs so it's very consistent we
only wait about 12 seconds to get
universe sandbox 2 to open with octane
and double that time without octane and
if you're a content creator a W premiere
took 10 seconds to open with octane 15
seconds without not too big a difference
here but it is still worth noting but
let's test an extremely large game a
game much larger than the size of our
obtain drive storage Grand Theft Auto 5
this is a 65 gigabyte file by the way
without octane enabled it took 48
seconds to reach the main menu
another 51 seconds just to enter story
mode without pain enabled reaching the
main menu took about 45 seconds so
almost the same but here's the kicker
story mode loaded in 28 seconds that's
nearly twice as fast as the same system
without obtain enabled gamers on a
budget pay special attention this is a
side-by-side comparison you can think of
intel octane memory as the middleman
between the cpu and hard drive it's sort
of like an SSD cache except Intel's
using their own chipset to facilitate
optimal data file transfers which is why
extremely large games like GTA 5 still
manage to load much faster with octane
than on a standard hard drive it's
pretty cool stuff so there are some
clear and undeniable advantages when
combining opt in memory with a hard
drive an SSD and not so much they're
already pretty fast but that's not the
point here if you're only sporting a
hard drive with compliant Intel chipsets
I guarantee you'll see clear and
improved responsiveness since octane is
essentially fused to your hard drive
you'll see faster load and render times
throughout your PC experience whereas
with an SSD only those files saved
directly to that drive will be quick and
snappy and that's the key unless you
plan on storing extremely large games
and other files like GTA 5 on your SSD
which Allah won't occupy is half the
space of a 128 gig model they load much
slower on say a one terabyte hard drive
include Intel octane memory however and
you get yourself a turbocharged storage
system for not much more than the price
of a regular disk drive itself so
whether you build a PC yourself or buy
pre-built
especially on a budget I strongly
recommend Intel obtain memory think
thanks by the way to Dell and Intel for
sending over this sexy Alienware over or
7 you can find this exact model link in
the video description along with more
info on and where you can buy Intel opt
in memory if you liked this video be
sure to give it a thumbs up I appreciate
that click that red subscribe button
down below by the way so you can get
notified with more videos like these and
go live this is science studio thanks
