the Apple sport watch I received mixed
signals from all of you a few were
adamantly opposed to the watch
altogether others rationalize the
purchases as the best way to enter the
ecosystem some were confused as to why I
purchased the se rather than the 6s and
even still a group of you praised my
willingness to experiment and drop a
hefty penny at that and that's what I
want to touch on first remember I
purchased all of these products
including the MacBook as well with my
own personal money Apple did not sponsor
me in any way shape or form neither did
any other company for that matter in
fact the only income I'm pulling in from
the series is either from YouTube ads
directly or my Amazon affiliate links
and where I stand currently in terms of
how I feel about the Apple watch and the
iPhone se surprises
I expected a much more restricted
cohesion between the watch and the phone
but to be completely honest they balance
each other out in a way that I never
thought possible I use the watch just
about as much as I use the phone both
make it easily through a full day of
aggressive use and build quality as you
might expect is top-notch so let's start
then with the iPhone se no it's not an
iPhone 5 or 5s it looks nearly identical
to the 5s save the SE logo on the back
and even has the same chassis and screen
dimensions but while most would question
the petite size of the iPhone se in
today's day and age I find the size to
be perfect I'll repeat that perfect and
here's why I purchased mine out for
brand new last season for three hundred
US dollars because I expected to be
checking email scrolling through
documents and even running a few intense
programs here at school for both my
classwork and science studio however
since I also purchased my 2016 MacBook
which you can check out more detail
right here I absolutely love it
I find myself using this for more of
those intense tasks even checking emails
I do that on this more than I do my
phone and I use my phone mainly for just
texting calling and playing the
occasional game I don't even really take
pictures with my phone let alone record
but the new 12 megapixel sensor with the
up 2.2 aperture it does very well it
films in 4k at 30 FPS 1080p at either 30
60 or 120 frames per second and 720p at
get this 240 FPS video is crisp
especially outdoors and holds its own
indoors as well and when accompanied by
stellar audio quality you can almost
convince your friends you recorded with
a DSLR
almost a major downside the iPhone se
does not come equipped with optical
image stabilization that's saved for the
plus models of the iPhone even my note 4
features OIS and I must say now that
I've grown accustomed to it not having
it is a huge letdown so let's talk
software for a second iOS 10 just rolled
out and it's spectacular if you haven't
updated yet I don't recommend waiting
any longer unless you have storage
concerns this se is only a 16 gigabyte
model it's how I managed to pick it up
for 399 US dollars but for what I do on
this thing and it's not much anymore
thanks to the MacBook I find that 16
gigs is more than enough for my daily
needs the entire operating system is
smooth and functional but still manages
to maintain that can
serve and controversial admitted
simplicity it's definitely an unsteady
transition from Android and I will admit
every now and then I miss my widgets in
stock camera controls the dual-core a
nine processor is blazing fast though
and two gigabytes of RAM is more than
enough for the lightweight user
interface battery life has been great
since day one and even after the upgrade
to iOS 10 I still find myself with more
than 50% battery left after a full day
of moderate use if you're a gamer or
avid YouTube watcher I commend you but
your battery life will suffer as a
consequence I will say however that it's
nowhere near as deplorable as the
Samsung Galaxy s6 is battery life cheap
shot I know it's why I went with the
Galaxy Note 4 in the first place so
remember when I said that the chassis
and screen of the se were identical to
the 5s well I meant it in literally
every single way the frame was stolen
from the 5s say the internal bridges and
connections and the screen is exactly
the same Apple makes no indication that
anything was changed between this one
and the one sported on the 5s it
produces one of those I'm not angry just
disappointed feelings while the pixel
density is still acceptable 640 P is
just just 640 P it's not even 720p and
it's not 1080 which would produce a
pixel density similar to other current
flagships and this trend doesn't stop
with the SE even the iPhone 6 and 7
stick to 326 pixels per inch that's the
typical Retina density and it's just
disappointing the + models make an
effort with 1080p but at 5.5 inches the
density still doesn't compare to even my
galaxy note 4 Apple needs to get off
their high horse with the whole retina
thing and move on to the industry
standard and that's 1440p I suppose
however you could make the argument that
having fewer pixels results in longer
battery life in the long run it
definitely shows with the SE but I think
I'm willing to make that trade-off now
let's transition to the sport watch for
a second it's pretty much what you'd
expect it isn't lightning fast it can't
send super complex text messages I
wouldn't want it to be able to do that
anyway it screens too small and even
running watch OS 3 it just isn't
designed with power users in mind it
does however eliminate the inconvenience
of pulling your phone out of your pocket
to check text messages you can even call
on it if you're into looking like a
Secret Service agent talking like this
everywhere you go quality isn't the best
but it'll do in a dire situation it'll
vibrate ring at you tell you how many
steps you've walked the list goes on and
watch OS 3 expands these horizons even
further battery life and what I've found
has been great I've always had around
50% charge left after full day's use the
OLED screen if first for Apple helps out
here and also cuts out that annoying
backlight bleed around the edges of a
screen it's also a retina by the way so
pixels are nearly indistinguishable not
quite as bright as the newly released
series to screen but 415 it's is
sufficient even in direct sunlight it
even comes with forced touch the sport
band is actually super comfortable and
easy to put on and remove and the build
quality rivals that of the SE and
macbook complements it's not for
everyone and I completely understand
that but for 189 US dollars the prices
come down a bit thanks to the release of
series 2 I say give it a shot and if you
don't like it just return the thing but
I have a feeling that if you're willing
to at least try it out you'll end up
keeping it I used to think smartwatches
were stupid I'm not plain and simple I
just I thought they were stupid but now
that I have one with a great feel and
integration I'd miss it for sure and as
for the pair right now I'm more than
satisfied a few of you told me to return
both and purchase an iPhone 7 instead
but this is my preference to isn't
always better than one but this is an
exception in my book I'm willing to
compromise on a larger form factor in 3d
touch for the sake of boasting a
complimentary Apple sport watch what do
you think let me know in the comments
below I understand why people are so
aggressive in the comments and there's
some people who are just going to be
diehard Android fans for life and others
will be diehard Apple fans for life I
used to think that I preferred Android
more but now that I have all this
cohesion going on I really am over time
I guess being convinced that Apple is
the way to go for mobile devices anyway
I wouldn't recommend Mac OS for just
straight-up desktop workflows but I
think that for mobile devices Apple's
got it they got it right and there's a
reason why a lot of other companies
follow suit with their design and their
integration if you liked this video be
sure to give it a thumbs up give it a
thumbs down if you feel the complete
opposite or if you hate everything about
life be sure to put your subscribe but
if you haven't already and stay tuned
for part 4 of this I'm going to do some
RAM test interesting Ram tests with four
gigs eight gigs 12 gigs and 16 gigabytes
of SDRAM ddr4 sdram and then I guess I
don't know move on to other things a
review of a pretty cool gaming chair
follow me on Twitter be having already
you've already known about that I'm
gonna hand the video now this is science
studio thanks for learning with this
