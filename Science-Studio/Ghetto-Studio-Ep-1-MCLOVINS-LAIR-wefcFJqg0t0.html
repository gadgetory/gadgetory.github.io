check those out I'll keep having them
pop up here and there but a Jacob has
his own YouTube channel Jacob tell us
about your YouTube channel then we'll go
yeah we'll get through all of this good
stuff bunch of stuff yeah it was like
years of collection in this room yeah oh
yeah this is a collector's paradise let
me tell you yeah so a little bit about
my background to ride motorcycles um
maybe YouTube channel called McLaughlin
the Panhandle so as most of y'all may or
may not know me and Greg started a
channel called entertainment studio
check that out right here ha don't
really care about my room because I'm
never here oh that's the excuse for
going low oh yeah we're definitely going
the back I mean if you look around
you'll see some things that you probably
haven't seen since middle school I'm
gonna give you the camera you go ahead
and give them before ok this is gonna be
embarrassing alright so I'm in order to
start with really I will just pretend
like we're coming in through the door
alright so every day get off class I
roll up to this trashy joint I call my
bedroom I kid I can't keep a straight
face
you got samurai swords we use that arrow
for the CPU box check that video out
yeah the super duper ranger pooper I've
had that for like six years since middle
school my parents love when I get home
it doesn't seem structurally sound yeah
well neither does this whole room so
what is that it's just like the corner I
don't really walk around some luggage
something some fan sent me a long time
ago actually really man yeah back when
I'll sponsor them black eyes she does
sponsored by Cheetos um that's me
Bailey some users are clean actually
those just got
sponsored by tascam I don't even know
what that is
so I recently bought um I went with what
Gregg had so I went with thank you I
went with a blue Yeti you be such crap
okay
are they fair warning I'm a bunch of sub
boxes because like everybody in high
school you had to have subwoofers and I
got rid of the subs but not the box I
know so we'll do this is a computer that
Greg built me well you built that we
built that little bit more than that
when is Pixar gonna freakin sponsor me
to I don't know
pixie Oh give you my monitor pick
co-sponsor me because this is getting
ridiculous as my TV / computer monitor
it's getting ridiculous here's my
skeleton that holds all of my headsets
all except the tascam shoutout to tascam
look at that look at that body work I
always have a nerf gun ready so if my
mom thinks that she's gonna joke around
with dinner I can like popper in the
face you know whenever I'm really
confused which state I'm in I look up on
my map so is this like the one place
you've ever been a long time ago I used
to have like a radio and that's where it
held up the antenna they do visit just
south east of st. Francis no I don't
even know where that is inside Kansas
yes Kansas oh no um there's where I keep
all my video games Phillies are really
dumb and I feel T people are gonna watch
us that's where I charge my phone
what is this can you explain to people
what this is that's an exhaust off my
motorcycle
well I hammer next year's in case of my
next-door neighbors giving me trash get
the Xbox one 360 all of that got my new
microphone for whoever keeps commenting
on how crappy I sound thanks I actually
went out and bought this how much did
you spin Jake it's like a hundred and
forty dollars hunter okay never makes
like that you got a said hey oh look at
those tascam throwing it down bro
th Oh - should get your wrong
impressions of what they sound like just
like straight up I have any literally
just took them out of the box like we
literally like we haven't even untangled
some did like try them out will be like
Breaking Benjamin Jacob I can hear that
out here feel like I'm listening to
something through a box oh I also have
the Hank Aaron signature shout out to
Hank Aaron shout out to my mom she
doesn't know I have this I stole her
from her you stole her dinner stand
close next door to bed and she did she
Rosa you think you're they call these TV
stands dinner stands Donna you get the
point you put your food on it when
you're watching TV in the living room no
you just blew dust everywhere and this
keyboard looks like you stole it from
our high school yeah look at the mouse
you stole that from high school dude I
really like how you've uh how you've got
everything just kind of stacked up here
let's slide this out of the I want to
break this it feels very fragile it
feels like it feels like it's gonna
collapse Walmart special right that 999
okay if it was gonna collapse at any
moment I need this by the way I can't
forget this hold this I still need that
though but if you had done what I told
you to do two days ago
I like the fact that you have this stack
the way that you do so you kind of move
this section over off of your bike off
of your base which whatever that I guess
there's two more subs on those look like
ten inch holes and yeah another I got
your computer over there I thought it
looked good but apparently according to
Greg it looks like crap no I mean it's
innovative I like how you managed to
kind of squeeze your your computer
underneath your TV that's cool oh if
people think I'm joking I haven't gone
through any of this stuff dude
University oh this is when I was went
this when we were in high school yeah
this is when I got like there which are
like four years ago kind of recruit me
bro
March 30th 2009 it has an expiration
that's seven year old coke you should
ditch xxx oh nine you should definitely
not drink the chug it give I spent $130
on a microphone I'm not really going to
use you're gonna use that on
entertainment studio well yeah but I
think this mouth you know whatever it
doesn't matter it works I can get you
another gaming mouse yeah shout-out to
whoever sponsored is Greg for game
stuff because I want a couple sponsors
like luggage e-skills sending one maybe
awesome love I'll see what J school can
do for you so over here you have your FX
8350 gtx 950 how's that holding up for
you gtx 950 blues someone says i need to
update to like it 1060 mmm that would be
good I'd recommend that actually how
much are those I think you can get a 60
good bite GTX 1060 for about two hundred
and sixty dollars yeah us know so how
about that I honestly would have
recommended that over that I know what
is this no I mean that's it's it's a
great mic especially if you know how to
tweak it in audacity and stuff which
I've already taught you how to do and
you're very good at that
so that your audio games definitely
stepped up but in terms of your actual
gameplay right now you're kind of
limited I mean you have to down some
settings like that's straight up to
compromise all of my settings below
everything's on low like really oh my
gosh
you want to show us kind of what your
settings are in game I'm kind of curious
now all of those haters I freaking
common who is uses the Xbox controller
yeah I freaking do is this at least you
have a Bose sub nothing freaking has
hard bro it's hard bro
like is it like a four inch sub if I was
joking but okay um yet you go pro here
four here so 4k 30fps that's not bad
here is this mine
yeah I still haven't downloaded any of
this stuff I gave this to you two days
ago so you could download stuff on I
started working on it though it looks
pretty good yeah it's the thought that
counts right my section looks great I'm
sure it does look how sick that looks
bro cause that's like trash
channel to Comcast and it's really
crappy service by the way my mom's
probably downstairs downloading a movie
oh really is that your excuse to be
surprised so when do you ever use the
keyboard Jake you ever use a keyboard
play games with whenever I'm like
trolling people and having to type as
fast as I can
oh so you just like swap hot-swap
alright so after about 20 minutes of
waiting for uh my initial downloads oh I
was pitiful so another thing to add to
the most ghetto gaming setup slash
office tour slash bedroom ever shout-out
to
cx-9 50 shout out to the gtx 950 whoa oh
my lo lo yell see how long this takes
oh my look at those graphics such trash
oh that is worse than a console let me
the graphic look at that have a jig of
your pegged is 60fps you could probably
increase your with your your in game
settings a bit dude these graphics are
pitiful man look at me arriving already
you are lagging but that's not a result
of your computer that's a result to your
network connection what what
alright now up some of those graphics in
advance that should be okay alright and
then ya go and apply go back to video
click on it again
no go back click on graphics again okay
that right there no no render resolution
go down yeah change that to a hundred
percent there you go oh yeah I'm sorry
difference Wow so much better it is a
bit better Jacob do you see a framerate
Jacob you're still pegged at 60fps you
can up more settings gtx 950 sucks bro
to help your setting some more keep
going you're locked to a medium texture
quality surprise greg whatever 950 sucks
I'll say it again watches great watches
720p nature oh dang it
we needed to take the Audi out so I can
make more videos for my channel
Oh for your channel yeah I haven't even
shown that core in my channel yet I know
that's why would you like a surprise
giveaway of what how dra go ahead okay
so folks I want you all to leave I don't
know I guess our rating out of 10 in the
comments below of what you think this
setup is in terms of get honest so a
tenant what what it's like super ghetto
have you check out the blinds it doesn't
even go up right
what is this really needs to pay me a
visit no god this windows I want you to
tell me in the comments until Jacob - he
needs he needs some brutal
constructive criticism here awesome you
don't have water crap well what'd you
think of his setup here so on a scale
from one to ten one being well kind of
just average and then ten being ultra
uber ghetto with like pitbulls just
chained a random wall super-strong seven
a strong seven that's what you're
getting I want like a shirt with nothing
but like sponsors on it so I go into
Walmart people are like look how cool
you know like the people that go to Game
Stop everybody thinks are like the best
gamer in there I literally want to have
a shirt with all of my sponsors like all
over it like Cheetos just just
Cheetos right now I want skittles too
because you know everybody likes
skittles and then I don't want Coke or
Pepsi I want dr. pepper to sponsor me so
many sponsors you have no Jacob as my
mom is my mommy yeah at least a vacuum
cleaner I mean that would double do you
a lot of good my mom hinted at it and
she put a vacuum cleaner in here but I
just took it out so you didn't get the
memo was vacuuming I'm not gonna do it
okay okay um well on that bombshell I
think we're gonna just go ahead and call
it a day his setup is pretty good I'm
not gonna lie if you think you've got a
more ghetto setup than the glove and
does be sure to email me I have my email
like my business email in this video's
description be sure to send me an email
show me a couple pictures of your room
and we'll do a couple videos on just
ghetto studios because well you know
dollars on budgets can't really can't
really afford to make things look
beautiful as long as they do the job
that's really all that matters right
Jacob

set up here and thanks to tasks and a
good quality audio so yeah no quality
