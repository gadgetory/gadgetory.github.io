this camera angle right here I'm going
to show you what my new lens can do I'm
very excited about this oops wrong way
all right
anyway I think it's a little too far out
let's drop it like right there that way
you can see that I have a desk in front
of me but at the same time nothing is to
work especially up top here you can see
where it's super curved when I zoomed
all the way out one of the downsides of
this lens but it is a very nice lens
fairly expensive under the most
expensive lens of a robot so the
wide-angle shots will definitely come in
handy for Computex which is coming up
here in a week it's hard to believe that
we're already coming up on Comics 2019
you guys stay tuned for that coverage
but for now we've got to talk about a
case from NZXT and it's actually one
I've already talked about in a separate
video
it's easy to look past certain things
but an activate Windows watermark yeah
not one of those things snag a verified
Oh am Windows 10 key from SCD key for a
little over ten bucks and enjoy a fully
activated OS without the annoying
compromises use offer code a studio for
an 18 percent discount on your order
this is the H 500 and it shares many
similarities with its older brothers to
the S 340 and s 340 lead to cases that I
thought were excellent and game changers
in the sense that they were
aesthetically different and functionally
different as well from most of the mid
towers on the market at the time one of
the reasons why I like this case so much
is that it is a great value about 70
bucks for a mid Tower that's not too bad
whereas you could spend a hundred easily
100 bucks hundred fifty bucks even two
hundred dollars in sub mid towers and
they're not gonna provide anything
functionally different for the most part
they might look aesthetically pleasing
to the eye but I think the HDI printer
looks good to some people don't like the
boxy score at off.look but I think this
is refreshing in this market the PCO 11
dynamic from Lee and Lee is probably
still my favorite case from a functional
perspective in the sense that I think it
utilizes space the best of any case on
the market to date but it's a hundred
and twenty bucks sometimes it goes down
to about a hundred dollars it's still a
hundred bucks versus seven you could
take that thirty to fifty bucks and you
know throw it into a better graphics
card or a better CPU and actually reap
the benefits alright get higher frame
rates in games maybe export videos
faster a case for the most part is not
going to restrict your frame rate by any
significant amount less it's you know
basically a hot box and has no access to
air speaking of which that's what I'm
gonna focus on again in this video the H
500 does not really look like a case
that would be favorable for airflow and
that's because the entire front panel is
sealed off the left side of the front
panel is sealed off the top is yea
sealed off the bottom there's a little
gap there and then on the right we have
just a thin little mesh and these holes
are not very big so at first glance you
might think this case is indeed a hot
box so the two hottest components in
your system of course your graphics card
and your CPU they consume the most power
they you know waste the most energy and
that's why they emit so much heat when
they are running either at 50 percent
utilization under percent utilization
even at 2 or 3% when they're just idling
they're still going to emit
a little bit of heat because power is
running through that system and a
byproduct of electrical energy when it's
actually doing work is heat and that is
something we cannot escape thanks to the
laws of thermodynamics so in this video
we're going to investigate air flow
properties of the H 500 why it works the
way it works we're going to test
different fan locations we're going to
test intake versus exhaust we're going
to basically try to explain why the H
500 works the way it does and why it
isn't a hot box because most cases we
would expect in this config would in
fact be hot boxes so in 60 includes two
stock 120mm fans their voltage
controlled no pwm support so they're
pretty cheap honestly not the quietest
fans of the bunch and I would recommend
replacing these if you're going for a
higher end bill that was going to be
fairly quiet nonetheless we're going to
use the stock fans to run a baseline in
60 places these two fans and an exhaust
config so we have one up top and one at
the rear both pulling air from the case
depending on the other components in
your system this would produce a
negative pressure environment inside
your case and this would be bad for
things like dust build-up over time
unless you have some pretty hefty dust
filters to keep that out writing our
synthetic i-264 load our CPU reached 80
degrees Celsius in the age 500 this is
the exact same system we've used in the
past to benchmark the P 600 s from
fantex the dark bass 700 from be quiet
and the matric 70 from deep cool so you
can see where the H 500 falls in line it
is a better case in terms of air flow
than the dark bass 700 and the matric 70
and only slightly hotter than the P 600
s which had an incredibly porous front
panel thanks to that nylon mesh material
by the way the front panel off scenario
for the H 500 is technically the left
panel off because you can't remove the
front panel it's actually a part of the
chassis
so what I did was remove that left panel
and just more or less just to check
consistency right because if we had like
a 5 or 10 degree CPU temperature Delta
in between all of our front panel off
scenario let's say the dark bass 700 had
a 72 degree front panel off temperature
and then the matric 70 had a 78 degree
front panel off scenario that would be
kind of concerning it would be very
concerning because that would tell us
that our testing as it can
mean that maybe our room is too hot or
we have an overclock in one scenario but
we don't in another want everything to
be again very consistent one as a few
variables and play as possible so that's
why I show the front panel off temps and
those should be within maybe one degree
Celsius of each other because they're
literally pulling in air unhindered with
that front panel off and when I say
front panel off that also includes the
dust filter if there is one so anyway I
say all that to say that I believe these
numbers are accurate and I would be
confident telling anybody that the H 500
was a better case for cooling than the
dark bass 700 and the matrix 70 but what
happens if we move the stock fans from
their exhaust positions to the intake
positions up front that's where the
experiment really starts to take hold
and become fun because I have no idea
what's going to happen I don't know if
the temps will increase or decrease
maybe pulling in air is better than
exhausting air in this case it's not the
same for every case but just because you
see it one way here does not mean that
every case follows the same I guess
situation so this is not you know is
don't take better than exhaust this is
not that argument just for this case
because every case is different I want
to see if intake is even worth
considering in H 500 now I have a
feeling it's not and that's exactly what
we see here actually I ran this test
before I ran the stock exhaust config so
if you're worried about the CPU being
hot because I've been running other
benchmarks beforehand that that's not
how this works
once things equalize it kind of all
resets and the ambient temperature was
consistent throughout I'm not gonna like
my power bill at the end of the month
but for science a three degree increase
in CPU temps in the long run makes the H
500 a hotter case in the deep cool
matric 70 and almost as hot as it'd be
quiet dark bass 700 which is pretty
difficult to do if I'm paying completely
honest both of these cases have fairly
restricted front panels again but the
dark bass 700 prioritizes silence so
that's kind of a byproduct of that if
you're gonna seal the case off it's
going to run hotter because there are
less places for air to be pulled in from
the atmosphere so the NZXT th 500 really
has none of that going for it it's not a
silent case so we're hoping for a good
airflow here and if you're hoping to
pull in a lot of
share from an intake config it's just
not gonna happen here unless you pull
the air in from the top or the back
which wouldn't be ideal because yeah
you'll be pulling in a bunch of dust and
other things that you won't want in
there in the long run so now let's throw
the fans back into their original
positions where both our exhaust one up
top and one at the rear let's put two
more fans let's say I want to buy
premium fans and put those up front NZXT
includes a nice little fan mounting
bracket up front so it would kind of be
a shame to let that just sit there
unused you can see in this build here I
have two chrome X fans 140s from nock
schewe
in in that bill that's my streaming PC
and I use two more of those but there
were 120 fans up front in our H 500
overwatch test build so in this case
there was really no change at all
80 degrees 80 degrees I let this thing
run a little longer to seep temps would
go up at all we did 30 degree runs here
but I listened run for about 45 minutes
and it still didn't go up eighty degrees
was the highest it went and this is one
C few times you know they they spiked
and then they go back down and they
spiked a little bit and they go back
down never spiked above 80 degrees
Celsius and that tells me that one the
fans up front of useless and you're just
spending money for no reason and two
you're gonna make your build louder
overall by the inclusion of two more
moving parts two very loud moving parts
under certain circumstances so don't buy
extra fans for the H 500 to keep them
the exhaust config that's my
recommendation and I know this sounds
really weird but the inclusion of a fan
bracket up front is almost pointless
almost because you could still put an A
up front but even then I would know I
would almost recommend in that case you
set those fans to exhaust out the front
because you're really not gonna get much
air being pulled through that front
panel and that side grill so unless you
have an AO I would say leave that
bracket completely blank yeah it looks a
little weird not having anything up
there especially if you have like an
overwatch themed HT 500 or something of
the like where you can see the LEDs
shining through that little bracket
there it just it doesn't look visually
appealing in my opinion but it makes the
most sense financially and that's why I
have to advocate in this video and that
ladies and gentlemen is a peculiar case
of the NZXT th 500 why on earth it
doesn't work this way why does adding
two fans up front
really not change anything and why does
moving those two exhaust fans into the
intake set up not you know help why does
it make it worse
for one there are more hole punches up
top and out the rear than there are up
front which means that there are more
spaces effectively for that air to be
pulled into the atmosphere by those
exhaust fans if we place them up front
in an intake config there's less space
for that air to be pulled in the second
reason why this is the way it is is
because air has to make a 90-degree turn
when it enters the Aged 500 and that is
a big no-no when it comes to fluid
dynamics and everything else that I
can't really remember from engineering
school I think I'm gonna refer to
Wikipedia here so look in the long run
when you have a huge piping complex
right because air is a fluid liquid is a
fluid so we can use them interchangeably
loosely in this scenario when you have a
huge complex and you have tons of turns
but long lengths of pipe the pipe itself
will create a lot of friction and that
will affect the fluids ability to move
through it efficiently so by the end of
that you know piping complex the food
might be exiting a lot slower than it
might be entering the pipe so if it's
entering at 10 meters per second it
might be exiting at 5 meters per second
right because of that pressure drop due
to friction the pipe creates friction is
also produced by turns in the pipe so if
the pipe has a bunch of 90 degree
fittings and you know that fluid has to
turn every which way before it exits
that is also going to slow down with a
fluid think of me eh 500 like one big 90
degree fitting and think of air like the
water in our example when that air has
to turn 90 degrees sharply be pulled in
through the intake fans and finally into
the case it has lost a lot of that punch
that it had when it first got pulled in
through those hole punch grills and
because it no longer moves as quickly
the intake fans themselves become
inefficient and almost redundant to the
point where there's no sense and even
placing them up there to begin with
because temperatures overall didn't
change which tells us that air being
pulled in was nothing really to squawk
after one there wasn't much air being
pulled in because it was so restrictive
front and four to ninety degree turn
slows the air by the time it enters the
case which means less of it over time is
entering the case and is being pulled in
through the front panel which again
means the fans are in a fish
and redundant so don't put them up there
again AO is a different story but I do
want emphasize that if you just have
fans up there like I do it should only
be for looks and I have like a ton of
these chrome expands I just put two up
there cuz I thought it looked cool just
look a little weird having a blank spot
there I get it right I get it but don't
spend 40 or 50 bucks on premium fans
especially if they're like the silent
static pressure kind like there's
there's no point for the h-drive hundred
other cases yeah sure but if you're
buying the H 500 if you're dead set on
that case there's a good reason why you
shouldn't actually there a few reasons
why the exhaust config is significantly
more efficient because those hole
punches are right over the fans and
there are more of those hole punches in
the exhaust places and also the intake
and fee while it is restricted from the
hole punches also has to turn 90 degrees
and that just it creates too much
turbulence it creates friction and it
ultimately reduces that punch that the
air has when it finally enters the case
and cools your components you guys like
this one let me know by giving this one
a thumbs up I appreciate it I want to
show you guys this build one more time
because I really enjoy building in the H
500 and this is like my think my third
or fourth building here and this is the
overwatch addition again it's more
expensive I think it's like twice as
expensive for the stock H 500 if you're
a huge overwatch fan and by all means
spend the extra money but I imagine NZXT
expects most of you to buy the stock h
500 so that's what i would recommend and
again it's coming in at a great price I
always enjoy building in this case and I
think this bill in particular again
looks pretty good with the orange
accents this is a the same bill we
always use for our case reviews we try
to keep this as consistent as possible
because again you want this consistent
runs between cases so we can compare
airflow accurately you guys liked this
