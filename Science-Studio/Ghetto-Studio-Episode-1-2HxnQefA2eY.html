first shot in the new studio now I
expect things will change slightly
especially the camera angle I'm not too
sure about that yet color balance
different lighting styles and stuff
we'll get into that more soon don't
touch the microphone Stan but today is
the gate of Studio entries day this is
dedicated to four videos that I selected
personally that were sent by fans who
watched the previous Godot studio video
more on that right here but if you're
caught up to speed then you're going to
see four videos that I chose that I
thought were the most janky or just the
sketchiest things that I thought were
presented well you showcased everything
the way that I wanted you to via the
rules in the description what I talked
about in that video so I do have four
selected and what we're gonna do I
decided to keep the names anonymous
though the people who entered are going
to know who they are I do have their
email addresses that's how they send me
the links to their videos and by the way
if you want to unlist your YouTube video
that you send to me as an entry I don't
have a problem with that at all honestly
you don't want to be known for having a
really disorganized room right so on to
the entries we're gonna start with the
first one here again I'm not gonna
disclose who these people are but they
know who they are and I want you guys to
keep in mind which one you think is the
most janky the most ghetto because that
person that you select via the Twitter
poll we're in Iran right when this video
publishes will be the winner of a $100
gift card or a hundred bucks cash or
whatever ecash we send it via PayPal and
I choose PayPal usually for
international transactions because it's
simple and secure and I can send that
money pretty much anywhere on the planet
so it doesn't matter where you live you
can enter this giveaway regardless of
your location that's another great thing
about entering this giveaway versus like
a graphics card giveaway where it's
difficult to send stuff to certain
countries so on to the entries we're
going to start with this first one here
and I'm just gonna have at it kind of
unfiltered and hopefully no one takes
offense to
some of the critiques that I make this
is my room see no door okay we use
curtains and lock it like this it is put
a pillow there okay it's pretty clever
my old box instead of d3 it's a case I
had wanted of hanging okay are you
hanging them yeah buying nails all right
my guitar that's a good-looking guitar
but it's mighty dusty my friend oh yeah
my friend he used this cool set to call
you or do you see the system okay so
it's a cool system I get that wow that
is beautiful in the video descriptions
you guys don't wanna know how to use
this piece easy you can see the cushion
I stole for my mother guest room it's
100 guests you sit here and to play use
the destory the
using a free ball park some raised
armrest and a newspaper person the table
that I'm using for the PC I made it
myself in majors that's actually really
cool
he made her on table I've done that
before it's not easy the way we play I'm
actually kind of digging this dude nice
and calm to see the whole point of this
right thank you guys he made it work for
himself he did what he could with the
resources he had and he made it as
functional as he possibly could I mean
like his own desk he's using a newspaper
for a mousepad
if that's not ghetto I don't know what
is but it's ingenious at the same time
and that's one of the reasons why I
chose him as one of the entries for this
first official ghetto studio giveaway so
let me know you guys think about this
one leave a comment down below we're
gonna move on to the second entry right
now here's my x58 based system I started
in a Dell workstation but finally bought
a proper motherboard one of my hard
drives has been wiped to government
standards so
that's reassuring I have twenty eight
gigs of RAM five four gigabyte sticks
three re since we do it's ball an 8
gigabyte stick that is much nicer yeah
shout out to coolermaster for making the
hyper 212 so chief over here i'll owns
an x-box 360 dongle a USB fan to
actively cool mine passively GT 1030
here's a DVD Drive check out the
physical media speaking of physical
media behind that bookcase is where my
cable internet comes in and goes here
this modem then I take that through the
hallway under the dog food over here
from the router and the Wi-Fi signal is
bounce back I've been there dude I
totally know you to follow that cable
man hardwired in the modem is where the
modem it is so thanks a lot everyone
else in the house that wants Internet
here's the rest of my house foam pads
that do nothing
my only to blu-ray Dragonball Z shoutout
to my dog missing two foam pads
shoutout to my other dog Roscoe the case
is double is nice TV stance here's my
external hard drive that computer
dedicated that molar hard drive which I
use as an external hard drive for my
xbox I have a dead r9 290 which is why I
use a GT 1030 in the first place as
evidenced by this Cinebench run where my
CPU is are too powerful for a GT 1030 it
is Wow ok so I chose this one because I
thought that the presenter was actually
very creative very intuitive again these
are unique solutions to problems that a
lot of people face frankly again we're
not trying to harp on these people for
having ghetto setup so the whole point
here is to just have fun right we've I
mean I've been here I've had trust me it
took a long time to get here
and a lot of that just has to do with
the channel success but a me as an
individual when I'm just kind of doing
my own thing I get really messy and I
come up with very weird ways of solving
simple problems so this person was
chosen because
he just he looked like he had it all
together even though his room was
clearly messy and he was using like what
computer cases like monitor stands and
stuff that's what I want to see right
because it works for you and that might
be get her to somebody else but it's
functional and he's having a laugh at
the same time so I enjoy that kind of
content I enjoyed that entry and that is
why this person was selected in the
Final Four
all right now on to our third entry this
one should be good
welcome to my get a studio Wow as you
can see I have lots of boxes extremely
cluttered these are mostly old
electronics and PC parts that's cool
although bottom ones contain books you
can also see all the testing devices and
power supplies different wires Wow shelf
space is occupied by stuff that mostly
sits there collecting dust you can see
empty bottles wires paint cans here we
approach the court of the studio to
monitors and IQ chair to sit on one
monitor has a retro PC acting as a stand
it's an old novel especially I have
cleaned painted and made into a virtual
gaming machine and send this thing and
apply a few layers of paint and do the
masking jobs and such like but now I
think it looks much better here is my
old daily driver Toshiba laptop no
battery replace the screen and keyboard
as you can see into quite a bidding in
the past few years run the power cable
it's supposed to do let's put it aside
no this is the main rig it might say why
is it ghetto it has an FX processor oh
that's great it is overclocked inside so
it came up with some games was an old
Logitech it's on the verge of dying the
headphones are surprisingly fine for
their age they are a creative HQ 1600
this is the cid
u 37 microphone which are listening to
right now on an old handmade basically
stand this is the most ghetto part of my
setup might seem that if I were to
replace something I would first I think
go for the microphone
this was my ghetto studio living room I
mean it doesn't look that bad but yes it
is a person that lives here I can say
yikes my did yikes it's a great entry
and you can tell he just he was genuine
the whole time again very creative
solutions to some simple problems like
when you don't have something either you
can't afford it or you just don't have
access to it or you don't have time to
go out and buy it or build it yourself
you come up with these kinds of
solutions and he made the best of it
right he used that old case as a monitor
stand and then he kind of changed it up
made it look unique kind of customized
it to his own liking and I liked that he
worked with what he had at his disposal
and that's the reason why this person
was entered into the Final Four for this
week's giveaway all right now on to the
last submission and this is my personal
favorite I'm not gonna try to hide the
fact that I like won over all the others
but I think you'll see when you watch
this one why I like this one more than
the others not because it's more ghetto
but because the presenter had such great
charisma all of these entries were great
but this one especially stood out to me
so here we go
greetings science studio this is Lanigan
aka Casey and if you want some ghetto
studios man do I have a treat for you
from my studio is not just my own ghetto
setup but my girlfriend's as well in the
one room we share with our baby we have
a bunch of computers here all of which
work as you can see the more you look at
it the bigger of a trainwreck it is yeah
this is right do all my streaming and
recording from this PC it works here's
your video we just watched we just
edited some stuff in GIMP
dude it's let us pill bottle like
supporting your completely working I
also have to surface pros obviously
they're running old EverQuest cuz that's
what I played them on we just won to the
busy white one with a broken screen that
you can't really see on the camera but
there's tape so much screen does not
function so I've taped it to an old baby
food container oh that's go ahead and
edit a mouse and keyboard and now it
works just fine this is an old laptop
that I use also for gaming but it's
mostly a music server
it runs music all day and it is also
sitting on a baby food platform and show
you that this is securely wired to the
top of my computer tower and my computer
makes this lovely fan sound from the
power supply now when I am trying to
record things and I have the camera
facing myself this laptop also does work
but it's currently my light stand
CA I don't have a proper face light so
this doubles as my face like maybe some
paper curves over a desk lamp my
keyboard
yo is ancient although I do like this
keyboard I keep it on purpose even I'm
warned about the keypads or where the
mouse hi the best cheap mouse you have
ever seen probably also interestingly
enough this uh pill bottle here is a
completely functional you put another
pill bottle it keeps the number level a
brief ghetto setup tour full of baby
food containers and early old computers
why aren't you on you're not proving
that you work there you go yep yeah I
think that was my favorite but this is
objective and I'm not the one who
determines who of these four wins the
giveaway for this week so again 100
bucks is on the line and if this video
is published that means that we have a
poll running on our Twitter handle at
science studio whitey you can go there
and vote for your favorite we have entry
1 entry 2 entry 3 and entry for in the
order that you saw them in this video
and you'll be able to vote for the one
that you like the most so use this video
as reference so you know which one
you're selecting as your favorite and
then after what we'll do maybe 3 or 4
days for this poll to be open if that's
possible in Twitter poll settings and
then we will basically decide as a group
as a fan base here the winner of the
first ever ghetto studio contest I guess
we should call it so best of luck to
those who were selected again if you
entered you know last week or if you
just entered I have your stuff you don't
have to keep re-entering all of your
emails are archived and then what I'll
do is cycle through all of those you
know if you just barely miss the cut
this week you might be in the cut next
week right you might be selected for
next week's giveaway so stay tuned for
that keep your hopes up because again
might be entered in the future and
you'll get an email for me personally
confirming that you are going to be
entered in case you weren't aware of
that so the people who were selected
this week we're notified and they're
awaiting the results so head on over to
Twitter go ahead and vote you don't have
to follow us or subscribe to the channel
or anything if you want to be a part of
this whole process you can vote freely
I'm not too worried about box but if I
do have my suspicions
we'll look further into it there are
ways to tell if votes were bought it so
if it ever comes to that we will find a
different way to do this but I want to
use Twitter because it's a way to kind
of funnel the channel back into it and
grow one of our social media bases so we
get a little something out of this
because we're paying 100 bucks a week
out of pocket for this so until we get a
sponsor it's all on us but I think it's
all in good fun I hope you guys enjoy
this one I hope you enjoy the four
entries stay tuned for the results will
announce them in next week's get our
studio video assuming that the power
comes back on by then we're about to get
blasted by hurricane Matthew so cross
some fingers that this setup looks the
same after the storm thanks you guys for
watching we'll catch you in the next
video this is science studio thanks for
cringing with us
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
