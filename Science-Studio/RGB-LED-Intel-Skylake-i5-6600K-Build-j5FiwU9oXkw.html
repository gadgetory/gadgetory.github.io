brightest most flamboyant Intel scally
gaming PC we've ever built I call it the
brightest most flamboyant and tell Scott
a gaming PC we've ever built now that's
that's that's really what we call it
this build isn't the most powerful or
even the most expensive or even the most
economical but given the current RGB
frenzy it seems rather fitting first off
it's packing an intel core i5 6600 k
from the sky like lino currently
overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz housing the
CPU is the msi Z 178 gaming pro
motherboard equipped with two sets of
LEDs the right side of which features
interchangeable RGB integration for our
Ram we've opted for 24 gigabyte 6 of a
vic seer blitz ddr4 clock at
twenty-eight hundred megahertz our
graphics card is a 4 gigabyte EVGA gtx
960 4 gigabyte super super flock edition
with a factory overclock and plenty of
horsepower for 1080p and even 1440p
gaming beneath the goodies in the
basement is an EVGA 500 watt 80 plus
bronze power supply which provides
plenty of power to our relatively power
efficient system so I kind of skipped
over something let's jump backwards for
a second cooling our CPU is the NZXT
Kraken x 31 in the 120 millimeter design
this brings our temps that Idol down to
a very cool 24 degrees Celsius and under
a full load temps never pass 50-seat
even with a 4.6 gigahertz overclock I
think we may have struck the silicon
lottery here but more on that later for
storage we're boasting the typical a
data 120 gigabytes solid-state drive
that you can pick up currently for
around 40 US dollars we also have a 320
gigabyte western digital caviar blue
hard disk drive for general storage
keeping everything together is the NZXT
s3 40 white in color and providing
plenty of window space up front to show
off the mass of RGB and RGB less LEDs
three extra one hundred forty millimeter
fans are equipped all from fantex
clashing mad and if you're wondering
about the rainbow going on in there
we've also thrown in a logisys law
jeeeeesus I have no idea are
LED strip which can be adjusted with the
included remote it's my new personal
favorite LED kit and only set us back
twenty dollars I have a PC part picker
of link in this video's description to
aid in your searches for all of these
components now let me very quickly
discuss what I meant by silicon lottery
that I brought up earlier in this video
you see all CPUs have theoretical
maximum that is a chip will only
overclock so much with a specific cooler
before reaching unstable temperatures
that is entirely subjective but I
wouldn't suggest pushing this particular
CPU anywhere above 75 seat just to play
it safe now this absolute threshold
varies from chip-to-chip even to chips
from the same lineup will vary in terms
of how much they can be overclocked so
our 6600 came i overclock slightly
better or worse than your 6600 k but
what i found is that ours in particular
has a very low heat dissipation factor
at 4.6 gigahertz in a V Corps of 1.3
we're still not even breaking 50 Â°c
while gaming or under full cpu load a
very good friend of mine also has the i5
6600 k however he wasn't able to get his
vcore below 1.3 5 volts at 4.6 gigahertz
without his computer completely crashing
on so who knows maybe we got a bit lucky
maybe he got a little bit unlucky but
that's a silicon lottery for you but
anyways let me know what you think about
the specific PC behind me and stay tuned
for performance benchmarks which will be
coming very soon also if you think that
the RGB color scheme is a bit too
ostentatious for you let me know in the
comments below if you think it's just
right also let me know in comments below
I read every comment practically and I
enjoy seeing your opinions and I enjoy
the discussions that I see in most of
the videos they're very nice and very
refreshing be sure to like or dislike
the video depending on your personal
convictions and hey if you really liked
it click the subscribe button this is
science to do thanks for learning
witless
