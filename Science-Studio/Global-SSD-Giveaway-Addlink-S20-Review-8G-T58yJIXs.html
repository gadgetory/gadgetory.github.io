those are always fun right this is the
adlink s 22 and a half inch solid-state
drive you're wondering who or what
adlink is don't worry you're not alone
and it seems kind of weird time
promoting a product to be given away
from a brand of which I've never heard
before but according to tech deals this
is actually a pretty good deal what do
you know so in the back of the box ad
link has actually included their own set
of benchmarks for this SS needs said
that Windows boot time takes proximately
10.1 seconds average app load time the 0
milliseconds I mean ok and then
sequential data writes of 500 megabytes
per second not sure if that's reads
writes or both but we'll be sure to
double check that when we actually test
this thing out speaking of which let's
go and pull this thing out of the box
don't worry this is not the one I'll be
giving away you will get if you happen
to win a brand new SSD and check it out
in the box you literally get nothing but
the SSD no BS no paperwork you don't
need that anyway it's just an SSD plug
and play course you might have to set
things up on your disk management tool
but then should be good to go by the way
256 gigs is probably the bare minimum I
would recommend for an SSD at this point
I know things are a bit expensive on the
SSD side nowadays but around 240 to 256
gigs is the bare minimum for any PC
period in my book and if you really want
to step up your game you can go up to
the 512 Gigan that they also offer all
these by the way are linked in the video
description along with how to enter the
giveaway I'm about to talk about but
first I want to test the same just so
you can find out if this is even like
you know worth your time
well I've got to say right off the bat
you're not going to miss the point of
these drives at all the advertisers read
speeds actually on the box that found
that on the bottom are 550 megabytes per
second 500 for the right speeds I used
crystal disk mark to benchmark both this
SSD as well as the Samsung 850 Evo which
is known to be pretty fast across the
board before the reads and writes pretty
consistent with the theoretical limits
and sure enough we got that with both
the Samsung and adlink s20 which I was
surprised to buy the second time around
I ran these tests with Windows 10 fresh
install for both drives which is why I
was up all night doing this and the the
CPU used was the i7 8700 K mr. deals and
I found some variance when it came to
benchmarking AMD and Intel CPUs I have a
couple AMD rigs that I benchmark with
Samsung 850 Evo's and those tests did in
fact yield different results than my
Intel Samsung if if the Evo drives did
and that's why it took me a little while
and get this video out but with that
said I still think this is an excellent
Drive for the price like I did look it
up right now this exact drive that I
benchmarked is selling right now on
Amazon Prime for $67 so right on par
with some of the more well-known brands
I would say but with better reads and
writes across the board unless you get
into Samsung territory in which case you
know they have proprietary software but
they're gonna cost a bit more so if
you're looking for a budget bill or
something around a thousand bucks or so
this is gonna be a really sweet Drive
especially for the price now if you're
wondering where the giveaway part of
this video is don't worry it's coming up
