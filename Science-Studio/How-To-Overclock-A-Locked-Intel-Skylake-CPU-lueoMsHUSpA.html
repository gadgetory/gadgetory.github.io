studio there's been a lot of talk in the
texts fear side of the internet in
regards to the ability to overclock non
K yeah that's right non K Intel skylake
CPUs for instance the Intel sixty four
hundred sixty five hundred and sixty six
hundred are all non k variants of the
6600 K but are significantly cheaper
than the latter
and while Intel doesn't normally offer
any unlocked version of their i3
processors anyway we'd still would like
to see the potential that the i3 offers
when overclocked to let's say four point
three or four point four gigahertz
there have been reviews out already
claiming that the i3 6100 was able to
reach four point seven gigahertz which
is crazy and honestly I don't know if
that was on air or on water but in this
case since we only have a cooler master
hyper t4 with us in our i three rig
we're just going to stick with air and
see how far we can get it and all of
that will be shown in this video so stay
tuned for that one important thing to
note about this overclocking guide that
this video will likely become is that
this is going to be for a specific set
of people now what do I mean by that as
of the recording date of this video I
believe it's the 16th of December only
people who have as Roxas e170
motherboards will be able to take
advantage of this overclocking guide now
pay attention to this part especially if
you're not familiar with overclocking
when you are overclocking or for
whatever reason under clocking there are
two I guess parameters to take note of
the first is the base clock the base
clock is just it's just a number really
just between typically 100 and 150 and
also the multiplier also just a number
but it's typically much lower than the
base clock number so when it comes to
calculating the frequency at which your
CPU will operate under optimal load
simply multiply the base clock value by
your multiplier so in the case of the i3
6100 the base clock is typically I
believe almost in all cases really
typically at 100 and the multiplier is
37 so when you multiply it 100 times 37
that gives you a value of 3700 this is
3700 megahertz or 3.7 gigahertz and this
is the rated stock value of the i3 6100
frequency in most cases when
overclocking any unlocked CPU the
multiplier is the one that typically
changes the multiplier doesn't affect
anything else on the motherboard or
anywhere else in the system other than
the CPU frequency but in the case of
this overclock the BIOS update that I'll
talk about in a second that goes along
with the z170 asrock perform or that we
have will only allow us to change the
base clock value of our CPU this could
have some unknown consequences the base
clock value is known to kind of change
frequencies a bit with our RAM and if
you saw our RAM overclocking video you
know that having set values for your RAM
frequency is very important especially
when it comes to gaming and rendering
and things of that sort but overclocking
Ram is tricky and if you don't mess with
voltages too much you can lead to system
crashes and you know having to reset
your CMOS a bunch of things that are
just quite frankly unwanted and large
waste of time
so with that I am going to say this do
this at your own risk make sure that
what you do to your CPU and to your
memory I guess as a result in your BIOS
is sound and makes sense I don't
overclock your cpu to like 5 gigahertz
and then restart your system and expect
it to boot up that's that's crazy
especially through not changing any
voltage values there are plenty of diets
on YouTube and just online in general in
regards to overclocking a CPU
appropriately so if you're not familiar
with a gradual increase in voltage as
you increase your multiplier or base
clock then kind of stay away from this
video from now and read up on those
things first we will have a video up on
science Studios YouTube page shortly
about how to properly overclock a CPU
but until then make sure you do your
research before you do this we're only
making this video right now because the
the Intel was kind of released for the
Intel for the Intel processor it's only
a few days ago so this is very new this
is a very experimental in fact the BIOS
that we're going to install onto our pro
4 board is only in the beta stage so
we're taking actually quite a big risk
here
with updating a BIOS and as you know I
personally don't like updating BIOS is
in general especially if the computer is
already running stable so keep
all those things in mind before you
actually go into doing what we're about
to do so the first thing we're going to
do is our research and if you follow
along with us you'll quickly find that
Tom's or calm is a pretty excellent
article on how to overclock it lists all
of the I guess compatible motherboards
here in this list and then tells you
which BIOS update you'll need for that
particular motherboard so as we selected
our as we found these were pretty much
the regular BIOS updates but then we
popped over to the beta tab and found
two possible beta updates the one that
we want of course is going to be the
flash ready BIOS update simply because
all we'll have to do is drag that onto a
thumb drive and then let our by us do
the rest
so like the BIOS corresponding to your
motherboard and then download it to the
root of your USB Drive that you use to
boot from in the following step once the
ROM saves on to your USB thumb drive go
ahead and eject it appropriately don't
just pull the thing out but eject it
appropriately to ensure that the data
you just transferred transfers
successfully and kind of sticks trust me
you don't want a bad BIOS ROM that would
be catastrophic so the first thing we're
going to do is go ahead and plug in our
USB thumb drives into the computer with
our asrock pro 4 LGA 1151 motherboard
hopefully this works I have no idea
cross my fingers so for asrock
motherboards I believe how to get in the
BIOS is just f2 so yeah should hear a
little beep if you have a speaker in
there
okay so we are in the BIOS I haven't
reset my my ram speed so it's actually
still at 21 33 but
I believe this is where we're supposed
to go instant flash so that was what it
said on the on the azrog motherboard
website that we downloaded the instant
flash rom so let's uh let's see what
it's going to do okay so it's going to
scan through and it's going to say well
you've got a couple roms here so right
exactly
so if you didn't notice before what we
did was we put the extracted folder in
there we put the non extracted folder in
there and then just the plain old ROM in
the in the USB thumb drive just in case
because I wasn't sure which one the BIOS
would prefer so I'm probably just going
to go with the regular stock not stock
but I'm probably going to go with the
regular ROM that's not in a zip file so
that would be this one two point eight
three is the BIOS update that will allow
us to overclock so that's the one that
we're going to do hopefully this this
works let's see how it goes
okay so it turned off like I said I have
no idea what this is supposed to do I
don't like updating BIOS so it's doing
its own thing
is it gonna boot okay all right so it's
flashing right now this is important you
don't want your computer to turn off why
this is updating so if we were to have a
sudden power outage right now I would be
Sol not even kidding
and once your BIOS becomes corrupted
your whole motherboard is fried and
becomes just a large paperweight so you
really really want this to finish don't
touch anything
let it do its thing I don't know what
that is but yeah just make sure if you
have a UPS or something like a power
supply that will keep your computer
running in the event of a power outage
that's even better just make sure that
when you're doing it there's not like a
storm outside or you know make sure you
have a reliable power so all this stuff
is important you don't want to cut off
any of this it's updating the UEFI right
now that's super super important that's
like our whole BIOS so don't touch
anything
like I said let this do its thing if
this cuts off at any point while this is
filming like I said I'm Sol so like you
know do this at your own risk this is
there's a sensitive stuff I I get so
antsy when it comes to updating BIOS as
I had do not like this I don't like
leaving the fate of my computer in the
hands of my local power company
I'll speed it up by the way right now
I'll just go ahead and fast-forward and
then you know if anything happens I'll
slow it down for you
okay so I'm slowing it back down for you
guys see it's actually speeding up the
closer we get to 100% so I probably like
left the rest of this go out just so you
can get an idea of how long it should
take for your biased updates you know
what the you know worry or anything like
that even though I am still worrying
because it's not finished yet it's
scaring me
okay so I've got off of Ford hit 100%
that's not cool
even if it was finished that still is
uncool oh and should be at a post hoping
see this is this is the stuff right
Jesus
maybe I don't like this oh that is scary
okay so it looks like it might be
booting into the OS now which would mean
I assume that the BIOS is updated
successfully yep okay so we're in we're
into the operating system so that for
the most part means that the BIOS
updated successfully I was very scary
but I wanted to show you the whole
process of updating a BIOS just have a
backup there's I don't believe there's
any way to backup your previous BIOS if
there is in your particular BIOS for
whatever motherboard you have definitely
take advantage of that but what I did
just in case we happen to have a BIOS of
a failure
I had another 2.8 BIOS update which is
just a regular non-beta
BIOS that I would have updated if that
one had failed and the most important
thing about failing bios's is that if
the BIOS does fail to update do not turn
off your computer because then you're
not going to be able to boot into your
regular cycle because your motherboard
has no idea what is loaded on to the C
Mo's so yeah just make sure that you
have some backups that's pretty much the
rule of thumb here now what I did while
we were on the desktop was make sure
that all my programs worked correctly I
know the BIOS really did that much to do
with how the operating system actually
operates but I did want to make sure
that there were no stability issues with
that update being that it's a beta BIOS
and you know I'm just not sure how
everything's going to communicate with
the new update so that's what I was
doing in between these these film cuts
so yeah all right so it's restarted
get that f2 going should hear the beep
and if you have a speaker I recommend
getting a speaker just turn off the part
where it beeps when you start up and Wow
okay so right okay so this is completely
different than the older BIOS that we
were sporting yeah I'm just I guess
we're just gonna have to figure this out
as we go I thought this would be similar
to so what we while we were looking at
before so all right that being said it
does look like they did a pretty good
job with changing everything and making
it look more I mean all the system
information you would ever want to see I
presume would be on this homepage here
for the BIOS so that's nice so fan
status it's a pretty big thing you can
change I believe here the the fan speed
so let's see we do that performance okay
so that's going to speed up the fans so
you can see our pans are increasing
naturally now they're getting even
higher than that I don't know why that
one's whacked out sometimes it hits like
20,000 rpm but of course that's not
really the case so I believe advanced
mode is where we're supposed to go that
was the same same thing with a soos yes
I do want to switch to advanced mode I
just clicked it out enough oh okay all
right okay okay well so that looks much
better this is what we're familiar with
so first thing we're going to want to do
over here overclocked weaker and then a
CPU configuration is likely where we're
going to have to go did we just get a
freeze
yeah okay so it looks like our BIOS just
froze on us that kind of that kind of
sucks it did this actually I should
admit it did this with the original BIOS
that we had that looked just like this
so um you know this it's just it's a
BIOS so that's why I hate updating
because it really these things never get
fixed but uh I guess it freezes let's
see if we can okay just control I'll
delete it reset the thing and let's try
again see if it works yeah that really
sucked let's see one more time I'm gonna
try to be more fluid this time should I
be quicker maybe it was just a timing
thing
so okay CPU boom so it looks like we can
change our Wow okay okay so this is our
base clock basically us what B clock
stands for didn't know that before okay
so B clock is big clock frequency so
that's what we can change and that's
presumably what this update was all
about this beta released by asrock for
these z170 boards that they have in the
market now so this is what we're going
to use to change our CPU frequency so
obviously if you're wanting to overclock
you're going to want to disable this
while this is spread spectrum
this is the one that you're going to
want to do okay so let's just do 100 and
let's see should stay the same okay so
let's do 105 now you should notice up
here is that our frequency is going to
change because we've increased our base
clock so yeah alright so right now if we
decided to boot into our operating
system with just changing this you know
base clock frequency to 105 our target
CPU speed is going to be 38 85 megahertz
which is I mean that's that's good that
means that we actually can overclock our
lock to Intel i3 skylake CPU so that's
pretty awesome I'm gonna see I don't
want to mess with voltages I really
don't know if we can even mess with
voltages that might be why the limit for
a lot of the articles I was reading
about in regards to this could only get
about 4.6 cuz for Ponce's gigahertz
that's likely because they couldn't
increase the voltage any more than that
may have been just because of temps I
don't know but we'll find that out here
that's that's what I want to do that's
the point of this video so okay let's
just uh let's just leave it there so
it's at 4 gigahertz 4.1 almost and then
what we're going to do is go ahead and
save this configuration and hope that it
sticks and hope that our system is
actually stable when we do that if not
and we cease to be able to enter our
BIOS we are probably going to have to
reset ASIMO's and then you know
reconfigure everything so overclocking
is it's it takes a lot of takes a lot of
trial and error and the errors can be
pretty substantial so I'm gonna go ahead
and at this thing just boot all the way
through make sure that it actually
functions and ok so what I did was move
this computer this was the one that we
did the whole BIOS update on put it into
moved it to kind of a workstation to the
back of the house went ahead and wired
it up via ethernet cable and then I
found out that my Wi-Fi router came in
so I went hadn't plugged it and set that
all up and what I want to do is show you
the core temperatures and the core clock
speed of our supposedly overclocked i3
6100 so we'll pull up cpuid and yep
there we have it our Intel i3 6100 of
course is overclocked core speed right
there is four thousand and seventy
megahertz which is exactly what we
expected it to be so that means that our
overclock is sticking and so I think
yeah what actually I went and did was I
went ahead and reloaded software
entirely and basically wiped the slate
clean and verified there after that the
overclock actually stuck through the
entire OS wipe process so the story
notice doesn't affect the overclock in
the BIOS so that might be normal
I'm not sure but that is pretty cool so
there you have it you can in fact
overclock and I 360 180 locked nan K
Intel skylake processor in this case we
were successfully able to overclock the
core i3 now I'm not going to overclock
any higher than this particularly
because of the temps this is what's
scary here I'm gonna use hardware
monitor for some reason I cannot find my
CPU temperature anywhere it's not just
in this app actually either see I can't
find it
I mean the CPU TN but that's not the
same it's not the actual temperature of
the CPU it should be around here
somewhere but the temperature gauge is
not loading of course we have
temperatures for everything else but not
for the CPU so what I tried to do was
use a different program I went in here
and used real temp which is like it's
just another application that I found
online and what it's telling me is that
my CPU temps are 100 degrees Celsius
which is obviously not the case so yeah
it's not true I'm sitting right above
the computer it's not hot at all it's
not pushing out any eat really I mean
it's idle anyway so I know that's not
correct
and I think what may have happened was
the BIOS update may have
I don't know maybe messed up a couple of
sensors not too sure but you know if
that's a big deal to you you know maybe
stay away from this for that reason in
particular maybe a few threats ago got
messed up but your ability to monitor
the CPU temperatures in this case are
going to be hindered I will continue
investigating that but like I said you
can overclock and i3 6100 and there's
proof in the pudding right there so let
me go ahead and run one more test going
to install yeah I have to install it
Geekbench and we'll see how that
performs and we'll compare the scores we
had a geek bench before the old clock
with the scores that we're gonna have
now with the overclock so we'll go ahead
and install that very quick here boom
and then let's go ahead and run it so it
should be a bit of a CPU performance
increase let's see how it goes
I'll go ahead and run it just in
real-time and that you guys see the
whole process if you want go ahead and
fast-forward through this set know by
the way I know it says 3.3 gigahertz
there but that's that's not the case I
really don't know like II been just
saying that but it's not a 3.3 gigahertz
okay so it looks like it's going to take
around one minute and 15 seconds and our
score Wow a single core score 41:22 and
our multi-core score is 8808 that is
pretty awesome
that's definitely higher than our
previous single core score and our
multi-core score
I believe well let's uh let's go ahead
and put up the old scores yeah so there
is an increase 41 22 verse 38 86 and 28
excuse me 8808 versus 82 1 7 it's pretty
awesome there are benefits to reap in
this case I believe that this is
overclocked to what the other websites
were claiming they were able to get
theirs to 4.5 4.6 secure Hertz I do
believe that this I three will approach
I five territory that is pretty awesome
so basically I guess the rule of thumb
here is you don't have to purchasing a
processor to take advantage of the
excellent performance of an intel k
processor so I went ahead and turn the
phone around real quick I just want to
end by saying this I appreciate your
patience please do this at your own risk
this is new this is in beta phase I mean
everything about this is in beta phase
it works for me but you know it might
not work for you make sure that you do
if you decide to pursue this have azrog
z170 and as Weka see what semi chipset
for your motherboard and make sure that
you don't over clock like chaotically
don't go to like 5 or 5.5 diggers that's
insane I don't know if any process or
other than you know maybe like the 8350
that would reach that on air so keep all
that in mind do it at your own risk but
you'll have fun experiment do it safely
and you should see results like mine
that we've seen here so that's about it
guys leave a thumbs up if you thought
this video was pretty cool leave a
thumbs down if you thought we'd do lots
like a thumb sideways leave a thumbs
down if you didn't think we did too well
let us know what we can do to improve
our videos as always leave comments
leave questions we will respond to all
of them so thanks for your devotion to
us guys we appreciate the community
that's kind of forming around this is
pretty awesome and it's because of you
guys were able to do all this stuff so
without further ado
science studio thanks for learning with
us
