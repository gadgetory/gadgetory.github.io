with an email title to get new product
for free and you know when it starts
like this it's gonna be good so they
literally left like generic customer
name insert customer here you know like
little imprint so this is where science
to do I suppose should have been but
because they sent this out again to
probably several different outlets they
decided to not include our name and make
us feel super special hello I am very
glad to know that you are a excellent
Goods reviewers and email to you
this is seller blank from Amazon there
is a new product car diffuser which is
looking forward to being reviewed if you
are interested in the product insert
customer name customer I maybe that's
where the maybe that's where the product
names are gone I have no idea car
diffusers car essential oil diffuser air
refresher ultrasonic aromatherapy
diffusers cool mist air car humidifier
with seven colorful LED light so you
know they're selling that RGB hype and
waterless auto shutoff and you can see
here we have a beautiful picture of this
device with a blurred out logo
interesting I wonder if they've ripped
this from some other company and are
trying to sell it as their own product
yeah I'm not seeing any branding
anywhere so I'm assuming that this is
just a ripped off product somebody
knocked it off and they're trying to
sell it again refund time one to two
days after reviewing which is an
interesting tactic it's usually a
turn-off for me because if you really
care that much about your product being
reviewed you'll just send it to me it's
not because I don't want to have to
spend money to get stuff I still buy
tons of tech gear you know I can't get
whatever I want free but if you want me
to genuinely review something you're
gonna go out of your way to send it to
me that's how I deal with most things
you know if I need something for a bill
then I don't want to wait for the you
know the the emails back and forth to
arrange the product for sampling I'll
just buy it myself
but this kind of stuff here you know if
it's a review I mean I would never
review this anyway but if you really
wanted me to review something you would
just send it to me you wouldn't tell me
to buy it myself and then you'll send me
the money back especially after you see
the review which is really sketchy
because what if you don't like the
review are you still gonna give me my
money back so I don't know alright and
this second one here this one is this
one's dense folks you can see business
cooperation requests tech products and
again it's very generic and vague so you
know it's probably just a brand trying
to sell online
maybe dropshippers we don't know hi Greg
it's such a pleasure that I found your
YouTube channel science studio a high
impact technology influencer okay it's
nice that she knew my first name because
I don't actually put my first name I
believe on the business page of our
YouTube channel but you can tell this is
kind of just a fill in like they have a
blank here and then whoever they email
they just autofill with the name of the
channel they're talking to our company
would like to establish an excellent
cooperation with you ignore the weird
English syntax and stuff
I am blank overseas marketing manager at
blank which is the most influential
shopping guide and information platform
in China at least they're honest about
where they come from
this year we start building up our
overseas brand blank helping Western
consumers discover the best new products
and Chinese brands therefore I would
like to invite you to join our Blanc
influencer program and get win-win
results below please find the detailed
description of our cooperation so this
is how they try to entice you right
benefits for me get the valuable device
and keep it for free besides we offer a
reward and then amount will depend on
the test product every month we have
over 20 new products for testing so
we're looking for a long-term
cooperation meanwhile you are highly
flexible to suggest us other devices
this is cringy which you are willing to
test and this is the part that I have a
problem with first off we don't take
money for any review and the fact that
they're willing to say that they will
pay for I'm assuming a positive review
and why else would you pay me is enough
to turn me off entirely
the sad so if I see that kind of offer
it's you know this product will never be
reviewed especially for money now if I
can tell them like I like I don't want a
payment I don't want to be that but just
be open for the good and the bad because
I'm not gonna tell you what you want to
hear if it's a genuine review my viewers
I frankly care about more than you
that's why they watch me that's why I'm
around because of the viewers not
because of the companies that send me
stuff because I started the channel with
nobody sending me anything so number two
business development with blank blank
and blank since we have deep business
cooperation with these media we ensure
that we can support you to create social
accounts on them okay and increase the
visibility of your account through the
use of internal policies I can tell you
you know before I blew these out I
didn't know what any of these companies
worth so it wasn't really a benefit for
me and then three long-term cooperation
with thousands of Chinese brands as the
biggest shopping guide platform in China
we have built up strategic cooperative
relationship with thousands of
influential Chinese brands including
Xiaomi DJI DJI excuse me oneplus etc who
a strong demand overseas Kol promotion
we'd like to add to our influencer
database for the further cooperation
with these Chinese brands okay that's
the English is so broken so they tell
you what they want we will prepare
product highlight briefing to assist you
to get knowledge of the test device
better create your content from your
perspective and your guidance oh no
excuse me create your content from your
perspective and our guidance describe
our promotion info briefly in your
infobox it's all in all this one just
seems again a little fishy I don't like
that it says create your content from
your perspective and our guideline if
this is a review I'm gonna do exactly
what I want and I want to review it
exactly how I want to review it first
off I'm not gonna be told how to review
a product and secondly I don't like the
fact that they offered to pay us
I think they worded like a reward amount
will depend on the test product this is
just super sketch here and I wouldn't
want you to trust anybody who would be
willing to take money to review any
product especially from a company like
this and lastly we have another generic
email this one's pretty short
they have four products here that I
definitely wanted to highlight because
again we reviewed none of these products
online like if any of these people
actually genuinely watched our content
they would know that we don't touch
stuff like this because nobody who
watches our kinds of channels and care
about this stuff I mean in general
when they look at our channels they look
at tech products that's what they expect
when they watch us which is why people
always throw a fit when any of us throw
a car review or whatever up in our
channels so this one right here was a
funny one actually made a tweet about
this and apparently I have to review it
so one of these is on the way and I'll
guess I guess it'll be like a funny like
gag infomercial whatever on a toilet
light because you guys wanted to see
what I can do with that maybe we'll
throw that into her PC and have it just
light up our rig like an LED strip I
don't know
it's an RGB toilet light too with that
but anyway this email says good to meet
you and again it's a generic right dear
youtuber because they don't actually
know who we are
I am blank and Amazon seller when I was
browsing YouTube your videos were
impressed me I'm sure they did no matter
the introduction or the editing they are
both amazing I hope I can get a chance
to cooperate with you thus if you're
interested in my product please let me
know the items I have sent product link
below I look forward to receiving from
you soon sincerely wishes does that make
sense look I'm not trying to knock on
their English I think it's impressive
when anybody can speak more than one
language so good on them for that
because I don't speak two languages
fluently but it's more or less their
target like what they want from these
emails is they want their company name
exposed on a big channel and I mean for
them anything that's you know 10k subs
or larger is a pretty big audience
that's pretty big exposure for sending
one product that costs maybe five
dollars or less to manufacture that's
really what they want they want that
that exposure on the market and they can
get any of us to review any of these
random generic products I mean they link
to the toilet like twice I don't know
what an elbow is but this link goes to
the same thing as this link so it's just
not prepared well it seems very sketchy
and on top of that they send links to
products that have absolutely nothing to
do with the content we typically show
here on our channels so
it's more or less a turn-off these guys
are just throwing hooks in the water
hoping that some random tech channel
bites the hook so they get their name
thrown out to the masses and that's
really all this is it's just an exposure
play and that's why these needles are so
generic because I guarantee you they're
sending them to hundreds of people so I
hope you guys enjoyed this different
take on an I read video for this
playlist if you want to check out our
Craigslist videos I encourage you to you
know you can learn a thing or two from
them you can laughs from them the I read
videos like I said are more or less just
us trying to have fun and deviate from
the typical science and review content
that you see on science studio and other
tech channels this is kind of our niche
and you guys seem to like it so let me
know what you guys think about this
video what I should do differently if
you want to see the style again let me
know if you want to see some tweaks in
the future all ears because this is kind
of just a shot in the dark here but I
did get a kick out of it and it does
kind of have to do with the industry so
I can give you some pointers and you
know different perspectives on emails
like this and maybe even professionally
emails I won't touch those emails and
videos like these because I don't want
to expose you know genuine people who
have good relationships with the with
the channel this is more just you know
I'll never touch these emails in person
like I'll never actually be interested
in working with any of these companies
because I don't think that they're
worthwhile and they're not large enough
to really have any traction or produce
or manufacture products that I'll ever
review on the channel because they have
nothing to do with what we typically
review and they would know that if they
watch the channel anyway I'm done
ranting thanks for watching guys thumbs
up if you liked it dislike it feel to
the top side if you hate everything
about life click that red subscribe
button haven't already and I'll catch
you in the next video this is science
studio thanks for cringing with us
