language whoever's like high quality
also of mine yeah so we have to hold
that thing up when we're unscrewing this
yeah that's will anybody know we're
going to be replacing the stock x5
grille here which we know so much the
plate which is not required here in the
state of Florida with the thing behind
you Heather is that black art by the
riddle or a bunch of bugs because
tonight has been terrible I've been five
like no arms and I think personally I
mean I wonder why I don't go fine
they're like nope and they're like like
knit I will die his blood will probably
kill me so we've got a few things do
we're gonna jack up the car remove the
front two tires and then we'll pull off
the entire front bumper it's simpler
than it sounds
I hope yeah I feel like it's gonna
so far we out of here Thank You Heather
Heather do is whip it around through I'm
good easy board first me first judge
active the car yeah
so it's always a good habit to go ahead
and break off no lug nuts just so
whenever you get the front tire up and
it times just in the spinning that it's
kind of possible to get those lug nuts
off because they can get a little bit
tricky my other tire was like yeah okay
that's not good that was just on the
freeways I know I remember kids blow out
your back
Sandra nice whenever you get older on
this side and we can stop that one up on
me oh yeah this is you'll see that if
you start to jack it up a little bit
yeah that's what I'm talking about that
is so close to the wheel will be I don't
think we're here all right yeah that's
where you get your jack you come on
tokugawa hey that's perfect
it's going good hey you know they say
one step forward two steps back
when Zhongshan said that you what yeah
we landed on the moon Lance Armstrong
Neil our new locks are pretty good with
their digging nothing wrong with another
I know I'm looking at rotors so they
scared your brake caliper remember you
whenever you hit the brake
that caliper kind of just which is not
repressive the rotor over and over and
over and that's what slowly creeps for
it's nothing for you down much she'll
let me get chopped for generally oh my
gosh Elroy break eggs in your great this
next to I'm using a 500 for this
tutorial here so we've got the car
lifted we pulled the tires off we need
to pop the hood and remove the front
panel I always like the way through
whoever man what drag of the scan this
was list to what nothing hey princess

video did you what video you saw the
video you watched it with me yeah I
watch the whole thing but you I heard
him say that he hit a deer where she
heard it other watches yeah it's like
the stupid clip I know I didn't screw it
in it's like right above it above the
headlight yeah I know it's higher it
can't be about this true it's right
below the headlight um I think I said
there should be two of them yeah it was
too right yes exactly
that's a great spot right there Heather

right there's a base I don't need that
okay that's all like okay
Oh anime and other stuff your honor bad
yeah that's a temperature sensor
temperature saucer fly back in funny
okay we decided not to just like
completely detach the bumper because
there are fog lights that are wired into
the bumper and we're not concerned on
living that we're not fully committed to
doing all of that correct there's so
much stuff holding this bumper together
you see all of them I feel like six more
