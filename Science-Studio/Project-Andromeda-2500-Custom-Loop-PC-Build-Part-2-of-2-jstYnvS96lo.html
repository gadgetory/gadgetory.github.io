um i cut right to the chase i hope you
enjoyed the tech porn so this is an
example here of a bend we'll be using in
the build this is actually a bit longer
than it needs to be so i'll be cutting
the top part as well as the base that
i'm holding and you can see if we line
it up while it is too long and too yeah
just all around too long it should fit
snugly from the cpu block we're going to
run it to the back tube so that the turn
from here to here had to be very sharp
both of those turns did but it looks
just straight up like it should line up
as long as we cut those links down so
that's what i do i don't measure i don't
take a ruler and mark on the p pd TG
anything like that I just kind of
eyeball it I keep cutting down just
barely enough to to the point where it
fits nice and snug remember you want to
keep these connections very firm you
don't want any loose connections you
don't want to need anything loose at all
period because your fluid will find a
way out it will find a way out trust me
alright so that is the first fitting
apart from this one here which was just
a just straight up I used a couple of 90
degrees fittings to basically line that
up with the opening in the 90 up top in
the back of the rad so the next loop is
going to be the next Bend it's going to
be from here down over on top of the
graphics cards and then down into the
intake of the pump we want our reservoir
to feed the pump directly that way we
can cycle the fluid without having to
worry about you know the pump not
receiving fluid and just basically
spinning on air which is not good for it
so I have the first Bend of this this
part here finished so it's got a 90 and
it's going to come across now I want to
make just like a more like a just a
mental note of where I want to actually
Bend this tubing so I'll just leave my
hand
roughly where I want it to be bent and
that is where I'll concentrate the heat
with the heat gun
all right and here is a setup so far
don't worry like I said in the beginning
of the video I'll be showing all of you
how to bend tubes if you're interested
in a separate tutorial so you to see
bends just like these being made but
that'll be in a separate video now every
Bend is in here except for the one
leading from the graphics card actually
from the radiator to the graphics
coordinates the direction of the flow so
up top I'm going to put a ninety and I'm
going to have it kind of angled slanted
maybe 45 come down kind of squeeze
between these two pipes here and it's
just going to chill and then somehow
make its way into here this is going to
be a very very tight turn but we'll see
we'll see what we can do there my hands
are pretty chewed up from twisting these
so that's the last Bend it's going to be
the toughest one I expect but in the end
it should look nice and still that's I
love that about these custom loops it's
not necessarily the fluid I mean the
fluids cool I like seeing it but in the
end it's just there you don't really see
it moving I just kind of exists save the
reservoir of activity but what I like
most about custom loop so they fill out
the entire case for the most part if you
play your cards right if you plan on SLI
or crossfire in cards you can usually
fill up you know most of the space in
here and that's what I like most is
there's no wasted space even though it
is quite expensive so with that we're
going to tackle this last Bend and then
we'll add the purple fluid
now you might be wondering this point
why I did things the way that I did some
things you Republic what was he doing on
floor didn't make any sense so chances
are I probably tried the Orthodox way
and I didn't work out so I would Plan B
C or D the first of these is the
inclusion of three dust filters now
these are aftermarket they aren't
included with the case the regular
defined C dust filter it's like a huge
door it's really nice but because the
case is not too long which is what I
addressed in part one I couldn't put the
fans inside the case I had to put them
on the outside but the good thing is the
front panel still clips on without a
problem now if you have some dust
filters laying around it fit that fan
config you should be good to go the
second thing you might be wondering is
why the heck we kept rotating the PC
like a 45-degree angle every power cycle
that's because the weight of the loop is
set up the reservoir feeds the pump
directly which is a good thing it means
you're not going to more than likely be
pumping air which is a good way to kill
your pump but the reservoirs rotated
sideways so because it's horizontal the
little intake fluid ports on the bottom
which are actually on the left side in
this case are halfway up the reservoir
which means the reservoir has to be
halfway filled at least for fluid to
drain into the pump
you know if it's sitting upright so we
kept having to rotate it to get that
fluid into the loop so that we could
power cycle it and not have to pump air
with that if you have any questions or
concerns feel free to leave those in the
comments below I've also included all
the parts to this build here so you can
pick and choose what you want if you
want to build something similar I also
use primarily thermaltake custom loop
gear a few alpha cool fittings but for
the most part it's Thermaltake I'm also
going to be working with primo chill
here and on your future and then
possibly ekm and talks with them as well
so more custom loops on the way also
some cheap builds gives ya what the heck
2500 bucks
where's the cheap stuff that's what you
all subscribe for most of you anyway so
we'll get back into those as well this
is science studio thanks for building
with us
