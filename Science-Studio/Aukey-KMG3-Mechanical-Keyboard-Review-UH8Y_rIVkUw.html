keyboard ever I've never been a fan of
their loud clunky sounds nor their
prices to be quite honest
however after testing and typing with
this one from Aki for quite some time I
will admit this one is growing on me
to be clear this video will cover the K
mg 3 in particular cover things like
build quality LED lighting
responsiveness things of that sort
but I feel like this would be a great
opportunity to discuss my personal
feelings about mechanical keyboards in
general as well and just a heads up this
one sporting cherry MX blue switches so
right away I noticed how loud the
keystrokes were a rather unfortunate
trade-off with mechanicus have a listen
here but I must say the feedback I
received from each key is absolutely
beautiful I feel in control of my
keystrokes it's difficult to describe to
someone who's never touched a mechanical
keyboard before but it does feel a bit
like shifting gears in a car and if
you've never done that before
it sounds a bit like this feels the same
way too you feel an immediate response
from the keyboard itself and I
absolutely love that speaking of
beautiful
Auggie's equip their km g3 with
customizable RGB backlighting a great
touch to any keyboard in my opinion you
can't manipulate the colors of specific
independent keys like you can on some
other more expensive keyboards but not
to worry all keys equip theirs with
several programs it's as simple as
holding the function key and pressing m1
to cycle through the different layouts
and pressing m2 to change color themes
were applicable I was a bit worried when
I read that the keyboard was not
programmable but the various presets
that you're looking at now we're plenty
to keep me entertained my favorite are
the ripple and rainbow effects these
programs mimic those expensive
competitors as well so it's nice to see
this one feature much of the same
I should note though that if you're not
feeling the whole RGB LED backlight
thing you can't completely turn it off
and still have decently visible key
faces the USB cable is rubberized
something I which was changed to nylon
for the sake of longevity although I
expect the keys to fail before the cable
does unless you're snagging it every
day which I don't know what you'd be
doing that for anyway by the way 50
million keystroke lifespans so yeah
that's that's a long time I love the
simplicity of this one as well it's plug
and play it doesn't require any program
installation of any sort every control
you could possibly imagine either has
its own dedicated key or is a function
of another key the frame of the keyboard
is comprised of a sturdy plastic with a
brushed metal face and no bezel of any
sort except for them you know you see it
on the edges there
the exposed screws give the K mg 3 an
industrial feel and the submissive Aki
logo is quite welcome you can prop the
keyboard up with the included back feet
as well for more of an inclined typing
experience switching from this to my
wireless membrane keyboard is a bit like
switching from chicken tenders we all
love chicken tenders right to jello just
two totally different experiences it's
really weird analogy but it it works
ones crunchy loud and delicious and the
others mushy cold and simplistic there
are reasons to ditch the membrane
keyboard undeniable reasons and that's
why the Aki keyboard will remain my
personal his daily driver keyboard for
the time being special thanks to Aki for
sending their km g3 for review if you're
wondering whether I purchase this myself
that answer is it depends
I will admit I wasn't in the mood to
spend 70 US dollars on a keyboard and
have it been for quite some time but I
will say this if I had about a hundred
bucks to spend on just a keyboard for my
gaming setup I would save thirty bucks
just pocketed or reinvest it somewhere
else and spend only seventy on this Aki
keyboard and I have a good feeling you
won't regret it
you can find a link to this exact
keyboard in this video's description
leave a comment leave a like let me know
what else you'd like to see reviewed
you're in the studio I can see if I can
rearrange things and make that happen
this is science studio thanks for
learning with us
