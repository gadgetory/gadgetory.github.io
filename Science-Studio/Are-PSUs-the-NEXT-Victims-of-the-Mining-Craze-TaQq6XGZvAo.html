was under 100 US dollars of course
comparable ddr3 kits were even cheaper
the good old days we saw a gradual rise
in prices until about September of last
year at which point they spiked to
uncharted territory in short a $100.00
kit of ddr4 back in 2016
cost nearly 240 dollars today just a bit
outrageous if you ask me likewise and
we've heard this one thousands of times
before and you'll hear 2000 times from
now the surge of graphics card demand on
behalf of a little something called
cryptocurrency has propelled prices into
even four-figure territory that's
thousands of dollars a GTX 1080 TI for
example debuting in the middle of 2017
for roughly 700 USD now sells
consistently for over 1,000 bucks
keyword selling they are in fact leaving
the shelves of these prices it's why
they've remained high for this long if
they weren't selling at those prices the
prices would lower more on that right
here but in this video I want to address
yet another potential victim of the
mining craze power supplies several
messages including this one from Dave
ream have flooded my inbox recently his
says I recently noticed that MSRP s for
a lot of power suppliers have shut up
about 40 bucks to $100 I bought my EVGA
850 g3 last year in August for just over
a hundred bucks now the MSRP is showing
at 180 wonder what your thoughts are in
this and if you have experienced this so
let's try to answer this one our power
supply is next
wanna start first by thanking Dave and a
few others in social media for actually
asking this question it is 100% valid
especially when seen in the context of
this inhospitable PC build market PC
part picker houses an excellent database
of price trends across several years and
this is where I'll go first to either
confirm or deny this power supply claim
now what you're looking at is a plot of
several low wattage power supplies
divided by efficiency the black line
running through each graph indicates
average price while the y and x axes
indicate price and time respectively as
we can see prices have remained
relatively flat since about mid 2016
when this recording began keep in mind
that this is the low wattage here so
around 500 watts or so the black line
running through each graph indicates
average price while the y and x axes
indicate price and time respectively as
we can see prices have remained
relatively flat since about mid 2016
when this recording began now moving on
to the 500 to 800 watt category we find
much of the same story depending on the
efficiency average prices range anywhere
from 60 bucks to 160 something worth
noting is that a few of the lower tier
models do dip below 50 bucks
occasionally on this chart indicated by
the various blue trends and great areas
PC port picker here is taking into
account the various vendors with which
they have agreements so they can monitor
prices over time onto the 800 1000 watt
category prices here aren't relatively
consistent to save a general upward
trend starting early in 2018 for both
the gold and platinum 80 plus tiers at
1000 1200 watts we see the same story
regarding a gentle price bump but
nowhere near the degrees some were
reporting also take note there are two
distinct price bumps for the Platinum
tier here which would be what miners are
especially interested in the first
occurs at around June 2017 and then
again at the start of 2018 will discuss
the minor PSU preference here in a
second
lastly we round up the tally with the
1200 to 1500 watt category where across
the board prices do rise in two distinct
places yet again June 2017 and January
2018 now while I can't openly conclude
today that these price jumps in the
higher wattage tiers especially are the
direct result of miners I can confirm a
correlation at least between them and
graphics cards because we know graphics
cards
being affected by miners directly take a
look at the gtx 1060 for example we saw
a huge price hike in June 2017 to sound
familiar and again in January 2018 same
goes for the gtx 1070 rx 570 rx 580 and
even the gtx 1050 TI a card we largely
anticipated would dodge these price
hikes in fact the only two cards largely
unaffected by the sudden surge in mining
are vega 56 and 64 at least according to
this database and that would make sense
as these cards are virtually
unobtainable still great mining cards by
the way if you're into that sort of
thing so this correlation is pretty
strong I would say mad around the same
time in both places we experienced a
bump in both graphics card and high
wattage power supply prices and it
actually makes sense if you think about
it because most miners are gonna have to
go out and buy extra power supplies they
want to buy 10 graphics cards most
people don't have ten power supplies
already laying around so that's the
first thing and then you're also gonna
want as high wattage as possible because
it means that you'll have less
maintenance in the long run and less
energy loss in the form of heat in the
long run if you intend on getting
something like an 80 plus platinum or
titanium power supply a lot of miners do
like display several cards up to the
same unit using a conventional methods
however for example running for graphics
cards or something insane off of a
single mole-like splitter probably isn't
the best idea molex connections aren't
rated for that kind of power draw
especially in the long run then the less
this would explain why only the higher
wattage tears are being affected on the
whole for these we're looking at
anywhere between a 50 and $100 price
hike since June of 2017 which really
isn't all that bad one see in the
context of graphics card price hikes and
that's where I want to call this one
while a few of the lower wattage models
in particular do appear to have gone up
in price at least just a little bit over
the past several months I wouldn't be
willing to say that miners are solely
responsible this just isn't as long-term
a trend as the higher wattage models are
experiencing PSU prices in general
always fluctuate anyway depending on
demand and availability and you'll often
see something called price rebounding
with these models as well so for example
if a 600 watt 80 plus gold power supply
drops to 60 bucks on sale for a few
weeks it may rebound shortly thereafter
to a much higher price than MSRP while
inventory is being built up again so
simple supply and demand right supplies
really low but a man's still high the
price will be raised until the
equilibrium price point is met so power
supplies do tend to fluctuate building
the short term we're seeing a much
stronger correlation with higher wattage
models so I expect that that was in the
market for mining or insane SLI or
crossfire configs will really be the
only ones truly affected by the psu
price hikes we're experiencing right now
on behalf of I would say primarily
minors if you like it's better to be
sure to give it a thumbs up I appreciate
it thumbs down for the opposite or if
you hate everything about life don't be
shy
