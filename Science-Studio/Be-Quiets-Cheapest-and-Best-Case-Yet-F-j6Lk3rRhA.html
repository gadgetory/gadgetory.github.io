sending us to Computex 2019 what's going
on everyone here at the be quiet booth
at an end gang exhibition hall and we've
got a really cool case to focus on in
this video this is the pure base 500 I'm
gonna go and tell you the price up front
70 bucks for the base model that's going
to include a closed-off left side panel
it sound damping poem sound damping
material on the on the right panel and
then you get this nice kind of mesh
material on both the left and right side
and a little bit on the bottom as well
for extra airflow which will be sure to
test in a dedicated video we have a
dedicated basement that extends all the
way across from front to back we do have
a cutout up here so if you want to stuff
up to a 360 ml fan red combo that
support is included that's something you
won't find in the H 500 from NZXT again
up to ATX maybe slightly larger than
standard ATX motherboards 7 PCIe slots
at the rear and 2 I believe these are
peer wings to 140 ml fans so one at the
rear and then a one at the front they
actually get two top panels with this
case one is more closed off has nice
triangles for some exhaust that we are
kind of like what we saw with the dark
base 700 and then if you want to swap
that out for a full mesh panel check
this out it's not your typical mesh
panel is actually a really nice frame
with the be quiet logo here toward the
front and by the way for wondering about
hardware support up top up to a 240 ml
fan rad combo or you can put 2 140 mm
fans up top might not be able to fit
that 280 rad though because it's
probably gonna interfere with your
motherboard the case is fairly wide
though and that's why you can fit a 140
at the rear up front io you got 2 USB
3.0 ports I don't expect USB type-c with
a case in this price range so that's ok
and then we've got microphone headphone
jack and then your dedicated power
button has a nice firm click feels good
and if we remove this right panel you
can see we have a sound damping material
here really nice to see that included in
a $70 case against the motherboard tray
we've got two extra SSD brackets
actually it's one big bracket you can
remove with a thumb screw really nice to
see that excellent use of wasted space
and then we've got space for cable
management here so you can run like your
24 pin through here it's covered by this
bracket the bracket itself can house 2
SSDs actually toward the front you're
seeing on this mural here now
those SSDs would look like if those
spaces are occupied we've got plenty of
timeouts here and you get these uh focus
traps included as well which is really
nice
plenty of space down below for a full
sized ATX power supply you can move this
hard drive cage by the way a little more
forward if you want room for that 360 ml
fan rad combo or just you know three
120mm fans doesn't really matter so
about an inch further forward that will
restrict power supply space a little bit
but this is what we get in these em ATX
excuse me not m8 t IX but mid tower
cases so that's a worthy trade-off in my
opinion gives you a bit of flexibility
and we're gonna show you a couple more
colors now because it's not just black
you guys saw the b-roll from the white
build we've also got kind of like a
gunmetal gray it's not official yet but
I think it looks really good so this is
that gunmetal gray again not an official
color yet but they will offer two
different colors apart from black there
is a premium only about five bucks here
for the gunmetal gray or the white
variant so then I'll bump the price up
to 75 bucks and I didn't mention this
earlier but if you want a tempered glass
panel and call you can see it right here
it's just slightly tinted so that's very
tasteful I don't like the really dark
tint especially on the white cases so
you want the glass panel that's gonna be
another ten dollars so the most
expensive version of this case like for
example the gunmetal gray with the
tempered glass panel is gonna come in at
about 85 bucks which i think is still
pretty good being able to keep the price
under 100 bucks and include all these
features is really good so a great job
and be quiet I can't wait to test the
air flow properties in this case looks
like it'll be okay not gonna be the best
but I'd like it's gonna be the worst so
we'll test all that in a future video
stay tuned for that special thanks to be
quiet for sponsoring us a cs1 mt making
these video as possible and we'll catch
you in the next one this design studio
