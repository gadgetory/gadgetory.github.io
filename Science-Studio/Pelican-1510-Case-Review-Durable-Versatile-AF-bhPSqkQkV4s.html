video you read the title Pelican case
1510 we're gonna review this I bought
this myself more or less for CES and
copy text coverage I want to be able to
take all of my camera gear safely
wherever I go especially via airplane
the good thing about the 1510 in
particular is that you can take this on
an airplane as a carry-on because it's
the full size like the the largest
carry-on case per volume that you can
take as a carry-on an airplane so now
that's a really good trait if you want
to be able to keep this with you at all
times not to say though that it wouldn't
be safe checking it in because even if
people threw this around you know just
treated like dirt which let's be honest
happens most of the time at airports
this thing would still be safe at least
whatever is inside of it and I would
wholeheartedly view behind this case if
anyone tried to throw it somewhere or
just did not really care what they were
doing with it the Pelican case is
designed to take a lot of hits and
protect the components inside and that's
why it is so reputable and why so many
people recommend it on sites like Amazon
and that's exactly why I bought one
because I have two cameras that I want
to make sure get to where I need to take
them in one piece I have a lot of lenses
of course the lenses you don't want to
you know throw around those things are
very sensitive a lot of batteries and I
also have a few other things that I
include in mine in particular in
microphones I also have my teleprompter
in there and a couple of other small
cables and whatnot so the benefit of
this case is that you can put a lot in
here for its size and you have all of
this foam two layers of pretty thick
foam that you can cut into and sculpt to
fit those components that you need so
among the reasons why a Pelican case is
generally so durable in the case of the
1510 a polypropylene body attached with
stainless steel pins you actually have
an o-ring seal and a pressure release
valve of sorts that prevents the inside
of the case from wanting to explode
basically not that you would need that
in a carry-on for a plane but it's there
if you need it now keeping in mind this
is the legal carry-on size limit for
most airlines this is about 50
centimeters long in terms of the
interior so what you can fit inside of
here about 28 centimeters wide and the
nineteen point three centimeters deep
and I want to stress the depth because
it is split internally by two different
polyurethane layers basically foam that
you can kind of mold again to fit those
objects you want to fit inside the foam
is not biased from a depth perspective
but you can cut it length and width wise
which means that you really have no
control over how deep the styrofoam is
cut because it's gonna be cut no matter
what at the thickness of the layer and
then if you need something that's
especially deep to fit in the case and
you can use the second layer underneath
cut into that as well and then let it
sit all the way down into the foam it's
actually pretty easy to cut into the
foam layers some people use knives and
try to be super fancy with it you can
actually use your finger and just cut
all the way down because there are just
tiny points between each of these small
cubes here where each of the foam tiles
is connected to the other so it's not a
difficult process at all I was wondering
how exactly people cut into this stuff
and the way it's laid out it's actually
pretty easy to sculpt for whatever
object you want look I've got some very
fancy shaped cameras that I put in here
lenses will fit I don't recommend you
cut it exactly to size put it slightly
smaller so the object you're putting in
the case fits nice and snug
other really cool features of this case
you actually have wheels down below and
oh you can't see them now but there's a
set of wheels here and here and they're
held on by stainless steel bearings
which is good for durability and then up
top you actually have a handle you can
pull out I'm hoping the cameras getting
this and you can turn it basically into
a carry-on bag that you could roll like
any other suitcase you would take
through an airport so it's very portable
you don't have to carry it manually you
can let the thing roll on the ground and
not have to worry about yeah I'm gonna
tack all that weight onto your shoulders
there's also a rubber gripped handle
right here again very durable you have a
genuine Pelican case a little sticker
here wrapped around the purge valve
that's to regulate the pressure inside
of the case and then you have two sturdy
clips if you want to open it up simple
as that
you can lock the back it's very loud I
apologize for that and then you actually
have two little stainless steel wrinkles
here so if you want to actually lock it
with any kind of lock for that matter
then you could do that on either side or
both wanna get really protective with
your stuff in here and that will make it
the ultimate secure a pelican 5 1510
case the hinges at the back again
stainless steel pins it's pretty much
built to go through any kind of torture
test that anyone might put a case like
this through I'm not sure like what the
most extreme scenario would be I know
people on Twitter who saw this picture
say that they've had theirs fall out of
moving trucks and that everything inside
was perfectly intact when they went back
to pick them up the cases on the
exterior were maybe a little scuffed up
and that's to be expected this isn't the
most durable exterior but it's a very
hard shell and with the foam inside it's
literally padded everywhere in here
there's really nothing to worry about
this is one of those reviews where I
really have trouble pointing on
negatives because I mean there's a
reason why these things get like 5 stars
all over the place and now that I own
one myself I can attest to how great the
build quality is how easy it is to
sculpt the foam on the inside look if
you mess it up let's say you want to
reuse this case for something totally
different you can buy the foam for this
exact case specification and and just
redo it yourself you know in the foam
itself is a lot cheaper than buying an
entirely new case for different
components you want to fit inside I
guess and one of the only complaints I
could possibly have is maybe the price
like it's over a hundred bucks
most Pelican cases are gonna be over a
hundred bucks and that's because you're
paying for some of the best build
quality out there so if you aren't
prepared to spend that much on a case I
don't blame you but most of the time if
you buy a case like this you're gonna
put really expensive Hardware in here
you know when this one's all decked out
for me I have probably four or five
grand worth of camera gear in here and
having a case that's 100 or so USD to
protect all this stuff very well mind
you is totally worth it in my book if
you're wondering what kind of gear I put
in my Pelican case 1510 you can see all
the stuff that this will hold and I
actually still have space left over for
extra lenses maybe in the future I have
a Sony a s7 too with a battery extension
and a small rig cage I have two
batteries that go along with that and
then two that fit into the battery
extension on the camera along with that
charger and those grooves were cut out
in the bottom layer of foam underneath
the camera cutouts I have a lot of space
down below for pretty much empty I mean
you could put whatever you want here I'm
expecting at some point I'll drop the
money on a better lens for the a72 but
for now I spent enough on the
we'll hold off on that I have a g85 to
the right of that which you aren't
seeing in here because I'm using it to
film this shot I have two battery packs
underneath there as well as a battery
charger I have two lenses down below
they actually sit one on top of the
other because they're different sizes so
they don't actually touch and hit each
other when things are being transported
now to the right of that I have a rode
videomic pro plus and I have a bunch of
cables stuffed into the foam layer
underneath that and then I have wireless
mic transmitters and receivers to the
bottom right and then my teleprompter
also sits next to that actually have a
phone there too it's a one plus five I
want to say and actually use as my
teleprompter device so I can run a
teleprompter app on there and then yeah
good to go I might review the
teleprompter actually if you were
interested in that so we'll see how that
goes but for now I want to know what you
guys think about the Pelican case 15 10
and any other Pelican case you might
have run into in maybe your field of
work if your company uses Pelican cases
if you have personal experience with
certain cases maybe the 15 10 in
particular let me know what you guys
think about it based on what you've seen
here I'm not gonna be like a severe drop
test or something like that I I'm just
not interested in dropping anything in
here from 10 or 15 feet I think that's
very unlikely to ever happen anyway this
is more or less for those unexpected
bumps in the road people just kind of
throw in your cases into the corners of
airplanes and what have you you know how
people handle your gear sometimes so
that's what this does is a peace of mind
for anything you put inside of it you're
gonna be a-ok and if you're not gonna be
a-ok if the case fails I'm pretty sure
Pelican is gonna do something about it
because they have a high reputation to
uphold and there's a reason why these
products get 5 stars literally
everywhere so leave those comments down
below if you have experience with these
if you're interested in picking one up
you can check out the description for
links to several Pelican cases that I
recommend this one is probably the most
applicable to most of you because you
can again carry it on to most airlines
it's the maximum sized carry-on by
volume so you'll be able to keep it with
you at all times and make sure that the
gear inside stays nice and safe with
