not based on a white theme ready for
this one black and red and thanks to a
co-op of sorts between deep cool and
asus rog i present to you the rog
edition of the deep cool genome in fact
from what deep cool is telling me this
is super cool I had no idea when they
sent the case what you're about to see
on this channel is the first-ever
official build in an ROG genome with the
exception of the ones that their own
teams have done just to kind of showcase
the the case so as for the name I want
to have something to do with just that
being the first if you have an idea for
that leave it in the comments below I
might choose it in the next video it's
important not only to me but to my dad
if you read the title it is his birthday
it will be his birthday on December 5th
he is turning I believe 51 if my math is
correct so he's slightly over the hill
definitely my old man at this point and
he even asked me for a PC he's been
wanting me to build him one and I
haven't done it for quite a while just
haven't been home and I just been
putting it off for whatever reason but I
kinda went overboard with this build and
I think you're going to like it it may
not make sense in terms of like a gaming
PC look it from that perspective but
it's definitely something that he could
take could make use of I think you're
going to enjoy this building process
here we go
so a quick rundown of all of the
components you just saw being assembled
the first thing of course is that
beautiful deep cooled genome rog edition
case has a nice matte black finish with
red trim and includes a 360 all-in-one
radiator combo it's a little overboard
for a 10 core Xeon which was a CPU used
in the build but nonetheless I mean it's
super quiet even I've even gamed with it
and it's still super quiet and the r9
fury that's the car that I threw in
their forum I don't really think I'm
gonna make much more use of it at this
point I've already done my second set of
benchmarks and DirectX 12 with it so
just I have those on standby for
whenever we pull up those charts for a
future video the motherboard used was
the MSI crate x99 Edition I picked that
one up at my Crescenta 420 bucks check
out this video here you haven't already
explained more about how that happened
and I use 32 gigabytes of a pacer blade
ddr4 a pacer has been very cool but
hooking me up with some ddr4 for these
builds and they do make very unique
looking modules I actually painted these
in a previous video white those those
are the red little bars in there but I
decided to keep them red for this bill
because it fits perfectly with the ROG
theme two other cool things about the
case I want to mention the first which
wasn't included in the original genome
case that I received as a review sample
is the fact that it has one of those PCI
riser cards you can orient your card
however you want to look at it
horizontally or vertically you can just
basically turn it sideways that way you
have your fans facing outward towards
you which i think is a super cool
orientation i would actually prefer that
even though you're kind of choking off
your airflow a bit it's it's not you
know going to be super critical it's no
different than really SLI or crossfire
it was definitely nice to see that
included as well as an entire RGB
feature the entire case is basically RGB
integrated including the AIO and that
asus rog logo down there at the bottom
left in front of the PSU shroud so those
two things also with an included RGB
strip that's installed up at the top of
the case all work together you actually
get a remote - I don't have it with
it's one of those white or remotes and
you can basically just slide your thumb
around the color wheel and it'll just
turn it to whatever you slide it to it's
super cool I really like that function
and it's nice to see that it's included
at the case with the case for no extra
charge even though the case isn't on the
cheap side per se you are getting quite
a lot of bang for your buck it's
something that I think enthusiasts
should consider especially if looks are
a top priority overall though I'm very
satisfied with the way that the build
out I think that's thanks largely in
part to the beautiful genome ROG case I
can't emphasize enough how how lovely
that case is it just it looks good on
video it looks even better in person
even that front little t-virus looking
design there it has no function at all
other than just to look awesome those
kinds of things are what you're getting
in a case like that let me know in the
comments what you think about the build
as I said though this is going to my dad
for his birthday happy birthday dad he
does watch these videos by the way he's
driving up next week to help my brothers
move some stuff back to Florida were
moving back for the for the break and
then we'll be back up here starting
January 9th ish kind of around there so
the setting will change and then we'll
be back to the same place again for one
more semester of this degree and then
we'll be I don't know doing something
else maybe doing YouTube full-time maybe
just maybe speaking of which if you want
me to keep doing stuff like this
full-time let me know you appreciate the
content by giving this video a thumbs up
or other videos give this video a thumbs
down if you did think that it sucked for
whatever reason or if you just hate
everything about life be sure to click
the subscribe button if you haven't or
anything stay tuned for a review of the
card I'm giving away see this video
right here you haven't already
the Nutt Hall of Fame but the Galax gtx
1070 x0c the same a graphics card
manufacturer that produces the hall of
fame cards isn't the Hall of Fame gtx
1070 but it still has some interesting
features and i'll reveal those in the
next video this is Salazar studio thanks
for learning with us
