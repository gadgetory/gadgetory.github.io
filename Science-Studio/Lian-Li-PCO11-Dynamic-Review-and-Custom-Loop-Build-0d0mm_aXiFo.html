to get my hands on and build in the new
Leonie pcoi lemon dynamic a co-op if you
go between Lee and Lee and herb our
famous German overclocker who we met at
CES 2018 you can check out that video
right here so I imagine Roman came in
and said lynly look I'm gonna make a few
changes the PCO 11 they're desperately
needed I'm also gonna bring the price
down and we're gonna sell these things
like hotcakes and he hit the nail on the
head I'm just gonna say this up front my
favorite case to date period so I'm
excited to show you guys what I've done
with this I'm gonna show you the build
process I lost a lot of my b-roll just
in a neglectful act of deleting files I
didn't realize I was deleting so you're
gonna mainly see just the bill blog I'm
gonna talk about the features and try to
show you as much as I can about the case
the primary changes that were made to
the original PCO 11 then we're gonna
talk about where you can buy it when you
can buy it and the value overall so with
that let's go
we right off the bat this beautiful
steel enclosure craft and tempered glass
on two sides screams both form and
function it's a rare combo these days
it's why I built what I built in here we
were sent the white chassis and I think
it looks especially good when paired
with this brushed aluminum accent up
front the tempered glass is only
slightly tinted which is a good thing
and the black trim it doesn't bother me
too much although I wish they had at
least tried a white trim for the white
case all panels by the way with the
exception of the top boasts tooless
installation thanks to included sockets
around the chassis both tempered panels
simply slide into place which is leaps
and bounds better than even the
thumbscrew design on traditional
tempered glass chassis z' cooler masters
key turn design is almost laughable at
this point the top panel fYI secures
with two thumb screws in a conventional
Lili fashion this is a dual chamber
chassis with the power supply situated
behind the motherboard tray I welcome
the style actually as a result cable
management at the rear is plentiful
dedicated PSU airflow is still achieved
thanks to right panel venting and a no
basement will obstruct the goodies to
the left speaking of which the space in
this case upfront is ample black rubber
grommets span the length in the
motherboard tray along with dedicated
EPS power cutouts up top as well as
cutouts down below though these are not
rubber grommet 'add if you put a
vertical graphics card here though you
won't even see them you'll find support
for three radiator fan mounts thanks to
the inclusion of a rotated bracket
recessed into the motherboard tray in
fact because of this indention you can
technically install radiators in all
three positions though the base mount
will block several PCI slots and
included SSD trays my recommendation
utilizes the right mounts first as I've
done here and include an additional
combo so you have one up top next no
fans are included with the 11 dynamic
which is something to keep in mind the
or 11 air will include two or three I
believe though the extremely low price
of this case for what you get is sure to
pull you back in and it looks darn good
doing it I found that mounting three
fans all on the right panel is
sufficient for a single GPU CPU combo
assuming you have them arranged in an
intake config so a triple fan pack of
120 mils should be enough now a
consequence of this case is form factor
is the dead space above the motherboard
isn't a negative per se rather just a
consequence of a vertical radiator
support
seeing as though no PSU basement exists
below the extra space up top beckons
another rad fan combo or in my case
tubing runs to balance things out and
again fill in the dead space other
improvements of the dynamic revision
include a hot swap drive bay accessible
from the rear just above the power
supply with a simple thumb screw two
hard drives can be installed from this
position not at all necessary but
certainly convenient and fun fact the
base serves as a secondary power supply
bracket as well
odd yeah but maybe not forward or Bauer
it definitely screams his name not sure
why you'd need two power supplies in
this you were doing some extreme
overclocking right up his alley apart
from the sheer volume you'll be welcome
to behind here things are actually
pretty normal everything's just in a
different place and you might be used to
the power supply still received its own
dedicated air supply thanks to cutouts
on the right side panel as well as the
vertical radiator fan combo you might
include
on the left side of the case a large
removable panel also keeps cables in
check similar to how the H 500 P from
coolermaster deals with this and several
type points still span the height of the
chassis so cable management will not be
an issue at all needless to say I used
very long cable extensions from this
power supply and I still had plenty of
room for probably a second power supply
a few bonuses include a vertical
graphics card support and the bracket is
optional doesn't come with the case
although I was sent one for this review
and it still provides adequate
versatility ie breathing room for the
graphics card which is always a concern
where I have a 1080 Ti now in this bill
the plenty of space between the fans and
the Left panel still exists keeping
things nice and cool however you decide
to arrange things though you're sure to
have a fun building experience I had no
issues with cable routing even with my
fairly long extensions drive support is
convenient the case is raised off the
ground in a proper fashion this time
around and a premium feel at only 129
bucks is a killer bargain if I had to
nitpick though I would change first the
way the legs span across the front and
back of the chassis just for individual
feet would be plenty it means you could
grip the case a bit better and the power
button led up front should be changed
something a little more neutral I think
white is a better option in this case
than blue other than that though I have
nothing else about which to gripe I love
that USB sees included I love the steel
chassis it's very rigid and I love the
tempered glass the toolless design and a
especially the price in fact if you're
willing to pre-order and wait just a few
more days you can do so via the link
below the top of this video's
description and you can pick up this
case right now for 100 USD a heck of a
bargain look 130 still a heck of a
bargain for this chastity but a hundred
bucks you got to be kidding me
so with that I want to know what you
guys think about the build and the
chassis and you're excited to at least
you know contemplate buying one I would
because you get the best of everything
in this case and it's not gonna break
the bank relatively speaking that's a
huge plus in my book good job your Bower
for revising the PCO 11 this is a heck
of a case if I had an award I would give
it to it hands down without a doubt but
I'm gonna say right now again this is my
favorite case to date I don't know what
else to say to that but it's it's just
the best it really is and you'll see
that if you buy one if you preorder one
now you won't regret it I guarantee it
or as much as I can guarantee it without
being legally liable if you liked this
video be sure to let me know making some
one thumbs up I appreciate it thumbs
down for the obstacle to subscribe but
if you haven't already and stay tuned
