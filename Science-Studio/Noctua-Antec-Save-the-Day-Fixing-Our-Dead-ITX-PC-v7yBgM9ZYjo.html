in this video right here he's having to
nerd and bite watch that one first it's
a step by step and guy of how to build a
super compact
ITX PC we had an issue with the power
board this is kind of like a picot power
board design so smaller than ITX
basically means we have an external AC
adapter and then an internal kind of
power board that splits loads it's like
the 24 pin APs and we pretty much ruled
everything else out except for this
board so we assume this board was dead I
contacted an tech they were super quick
to send another board like this and yeah
I could have gone on Amazon a few of you
were saying to buy some Pico power
supplies on Amazon but a lot of those
still had it sketchy ratings and I'd
rather go with an Tex just because
they'll be quicker to respond if we need
to RMA so we're gonna install this and
then put together the system again but
with one catch and that catch is the
knock show it online a am for cooler
this is a ultra low-profile course if
you have a you know a very small case
and you want to fit something
aftermarket in it then I recommend going
with this if you have an AM 4 platform
to work with so I expect this will be
quieter than the stock like race stealth
cooler that we're using here this barely
fit we ready to take the outside shroud
off so kinda looks a little ugly now so
if anything I hope it'll be just a bit
quieter and if you know anything about
Noctua I'd say that's probably a fair
estimation
I'm gonna get that rear i/o shield back
in there this massive cables but I want
to do first installed the new power
supply I could test this saw out of the
system but again
this is something that I could remove
without disassembling the rest of the
system so Emily it's gonna be a big deal
if you put this all back in there only
to find out this board is also dead
underneath you can see there's a lot of
solder points that are pretty sharp and
pretty long so we'll make sure that
these aren't touching the back of the
case so that's why this paper is in
there for those wondering put it like
that then drop the board in this screw
is so close to that inductor he's like
no space between them
hopefully that was again the only issue
and hopefully this board actually works
now the next thing I want to do is to be
a very quick fix we're gonna swap out
stock a be cooler then actua Phoenix l98
this is really loud so this is the NHL
9a and it is actually surprisingly heavy
I thought part of this was just the box
and accessories but this cooler I mean
this this whole thing here
there's no backplate attached to it yet
this is extremely heavy we also have our
in th one thermal paste included in an
actual kit so we're gonna throw this on
there first and then the way this
installs you actually have to install it
from below so we're going to lay this
down flat and then we're gonna put
thermal paste it's gonna be pretty
sticky we'll put some on the IHS we'll
flip it over and make sure that the
standoffs on the backside align and then
we'll be able to thread the backplate on
like so and then screw it in from back
here so a bit of an unorthodox install
but I think it'll be gonna be good so
there was a tiny clearance issue with
one of the erm heat sinks you can see
this piece right here was just barely
hitting an actual cooler so I've removed
this I'm not too worried about it though
because we're still gonna have
difficulty of sorts to make the it's a
top down cooler so I don't think it's
going to be an issue
okay but over the back plate ready to go
this is actually super easy to install
very impressed with this just make sure
you read the manual because I definitely
mess this up a couple times beforehand
and we can just slide this cable right
in there watch one CPU fan of this one
okay it's actually super on the DL as
well see there's our entire platform
looks great actually I really like the
way this looks so next step we're going
to install motherboard these cables out
of the way I kind of had to come come in
like this last time so I'm gonna give
that another try
tight squeeze show
good gosh just like no clearance here oh
this is cringy there we go
and it's sitting correctly
show them how close the the ITX board is
to that power board there is again no
wasted space and that's chassis that's
what kind of has me worried but at the
same time I think it's super resourceful
all right now it's got to wire
everything back up front io connected
cable managed as we go USB 2 we're gonna
stuff this cable I don't know same thing
I have no idea what we're gonna put
skeety let me remember where I put it
last on pin is next it's right here and
we don't need the SATA power cables or
the molex because we're using an MDOT to
drive so kind of tuck those in tuck this
in no push it all in here there let's
just let's just sandwich this thing on
there I don't think we're gonna be able
to do much more there we go and then
just like last time nothing's changed
four Phillips screws to lock in both
pins this one really doesn't have much
ventilation but there is some so it's
worth noting besides does have plenty of
ventilation and the top is pretty much
totally mesh which is really nice
plenty of airflow for our new knob to a
cooler I think I am totally basing a
whole of this on the expectation that
the new board is working fine let's
let's power it up and see if it actually
boots up this time okay
booting up we've got power and see our
doctor debug led says we have just
posted that's awesome but I'm going to
double check I'm gonna get the monitor
out here and make sure that it actually
is posting so I can get Windows 10 on
here for these does mama hey there's the
post that's perfect now I'm gonna get my
boot tool with Windows 10 on it and
we'll install Windows okay so for
installing windows I figured I'd cover
that in this video because I didn't in
the last one you're going to need a USB
Drive I just have a 32 gig drive it's
convenient cuz it's got USB 3.0 on one
side just type-a and then we also have
type C on the other side so I can kind
of flip it between either one depending
on what's supported with the board in
question but you're gonna want to
download Windows 10 and Windows 10 ISO
preferably from the link in the video
description it's up top it says how to
install Windows 10 it's gonna take you
to the windows the Microsoft Store and
basically that you I will tell you to
plug in a thumb drive and it will load
all the necessary software onto the
drive sort of basically turn it into a
boot device and then you're gonna
connect that to a PC and then whenever
you go into your boot menu because
remember there's no operating system on
this drive right now that we have in the
system you can have it run set up so
we're going to go to the BIOS with
function f1 when you're in your BIOS for
the first time you might want to
configure XMP and few other things I'm
gonna leave everything is stock I don't
want any conflicts with the PC for
Lisa's mom she's not gonna really
friendly notice the difference between
overclocked memory and memory that's
running at a stock out-of-the-box
frequency so I'm gonna leave it at 2400
I'm not gonna overclock a CPU at all I'm
not going to touch any of that I'm not
gonna touch the fan curve because that
knocked to a cooler super quiet as is
I'm just gonna show you how to boot into
the USB device because that has Windows
10 loaded on it so in this case it's an
MSI motherboard click the Settings
button then you come down here to the
tab that says boot click enter now you
should see an option for USB key UEFI
it's really
depend on what your motherboard
designates this as but I remember this
boot option up to number one so the
first thing is going to try to boot from
is USB heat if there's nothing installed
in this port and it's gonna keep moving
down the list until it finds something
to boot into obviously there's nothing
else in the system that has anything
loaded on it so it's gonna run through
all of these and determine that nothing
can you know there's no UI to boot into
and it's just gonna throw you back into
the BIOS more than likely so we want
UEFI USB key up top and then we're going
to hit escape we don't want to quit
without saving go up here to the top
right and click the X button and you can
see we changed our boot options to our
USB key is up top click yes now when the
system restarts it should kick us right
into the Windows 10 loading screen and
that will indicate that it's
successfully booted from the USB Drive
let's see how this goes
yep that's a good sign ok I'm gonna
click next install now at this point if
you don't have a product key can click I
don't have one you'll still be able to
load Windows 10 you still be able to
boot in the operating system there will
be an issue but I recommend you buy a
key from some third-party website
preferably you paid 20 30 bucks and get
a valid key in the last year pretty much
the life of the device in this case will
click I don't have a product key for now
and then we're gonna click Next Windows
10 home is most common accept the
license terms now at this point I always
choose the custom option because I want
to make sure I know where Windows 10 is
being installed so click that now you're
gonna see the drives in your system and
the only drive we have is that a data
I'm about to drive so you can see
unallocated space we confirm that it's
about half a terabyte about 500 gigs or
so and we can go how to create new or
click Next it'll create a new volume for
us and Windows 10 will begin installing
on that drive alright so when these
screens come up just to prompt you to
select your language and your keyboard
and all that good jazz just kind of
churn through it at a password if you
want you can also choose to accept the
cortana deal if you're into being super
cringy you can
locations and device compatibility all
that good stuff
I typically turn all of this off that's
just me so I'm gonna do that for the
sake of my mother-in-law and click
accept and yes so it's gonna say hello
we're happy you're here give it a few
minutes it's going to optimize the OS
and then we should boot straight into
the desktop and that's good to go last
thing we need to do is buy a product key
from somewhere to activate Windows and
her mom will be all set all right so at
this point it's gonna optimize a few
things I'm gonna install drivers for her
PC I get the Wi-Fi setup again activate
Windows and I'm also gonna turn down the
fan curve it was pretty quiet in the
BIOS but now that we've boot in the OS
it seems like it's running it pretty
much max rpm so I'm gonna turn that down
as well and then package it back up and
hopefully makes its way through TSA
safely when Lisa returns back to Germany
here next week I'm I'm hoping I mean the
worst they could do I guess is just tear
it down and do this little swab they
check for like druggies or whatever but
that should be about the most invasive
thing they do to the system I'm assuming
they let her board the plane with it as
a carry-on I definitely don't want her
throwing this underneath the plane with
her general I don't think she's taking
general luggage back because she'll be
hopefully back here pretty soon so we'll
see how all that goes again we
depreciate best wishes and prayers for
Lisa's travel and we'll be ready to go
here with another video pretty soon
we're also gonna be live-streaming
against Sunday night or after-hours
livestream as usual if you guys want to
hang out ask some questions just chat
