excited by how excited you all were for
the RX levity giveaway and frankly I
mean it's the least I can do I have a
bunch of stuff collecting dust in the
closet there that I know most of you
would be able to take advantage of at
least used to some extent so it's a
small way that I can give back to to you
for supporting the channel and it also
keeps the channel alive and active and
growing and kind of exciting a little
different than just a typical tech
review so with that we're going to
announce the RX 580 giveaway winner
first and then we will also announce the
second giveaway for the month of July
down to business the winner of the rx
580 selected randomly via Glee Maya
which you're watching here is Victor
from Romania the action that won him the
prize was his follow on Twitter so the
victor congratulations on winning the
graphics card I have already sent you an
email but if you're watching this video
before you check your mailbox then
surprise next order of business is this
coming months giveaway the month of July
it will run from now until June 30th
which point the winner will be randomly
selected global as always doesn't matter
where in the world you are when you
enter as long as you're 18 years of age
or older or if you're not that age you
just have a parent or guardian represent
you again doesn't matter where you live
as long as it's not North Korea or
Antarctica in which case I guess I can
just send you the cash value prize via
PayPal or something something like that
in those cases shipping is going to be
like 10 times the value of the product
itself so I don't know that that kind of
sucks there will be a few a center
including channel subscription of course
Twitter followers Instagram followers
Facebook Likes try to branch out as much
as I can so if you don't have Twitter or
Instagram but you have Facebook you can
still enter another way apart from just
subscribing to the channel which all of
you watching this video should be able
to do if you have a youtube account the
products multiple here have been given
away this month are an NZXT crack and
x42 that's in Deoxys third generation
crack and AIO and a crack in g12 cooler
in your choice color white or black so
basically they're giving you a choice
here you can either cool just your CPU
by using x42 alone or you can combine it
with the mounting kit the crack and g12
and cool your graphics card so NZXT has
given you a bit of versatility here
which is really nice and I've heard
nothing but great things about the kit
of course it's just going to cool your
graphics card as efficiently
this would call your CPU so ultra-low
temperatures on those graphics cards
good for overclocking bender that sort
of thing these will both be included in
the giveaway against special thanks to
NZXT for sending these products over for
they just kind of said here have at it
do what you want with them so let me
give them away and one of the ways that
you can enter the giveaway is by
following into the XD on Twitter again
all of that is in the link below and of
course the more entries you have the
better your odds of winning regardless
of how many people do enter don't be
discouraged by that by the way we're
always going to have these every month
you'll have a chance to win something so
just because you haven't won this
giveaway or maybe you won't win the next
giveaway you can just keep entering and
if you've already done things required
by the giveaway itself and you have
really nothing to lose other than
clicking the link and just verifying
things apart from that I do want to say
thank you again for all those who did
enter the giveaway thanks for being so
enthusiastic and sticking around on the
channel stay tuned for the winners of
this giveaway here this is science
studio thanks for learning with us
