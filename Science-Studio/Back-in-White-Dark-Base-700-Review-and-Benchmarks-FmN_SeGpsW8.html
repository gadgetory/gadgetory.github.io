video today well at least for part of it
we're gonna be talking about the dark
bass 700 ition we're going to build on
it I'm gonna show you guys some of the
features of the case if you haven't
already seen our original dark bass 7 I
review because it's basically the same
chassis just painted almost totally
white I think this looks significantly
better than a black model the black
model already looked pretty darn good so
I'm gonna give you just a quick tour of
the chassis and then we will be building
in it we're actually going to keep the
same system for every case review from
here on out at least for this year so
that we have a baseline we can compare
things and keep a high degree of
consistency seeing as though you know
we're using the exact same internals
it's really just gonna come down to the
case the the style of case the airflow
preferences how things are laid out that
will determine our core temperatures
both for our CPU and a GPU but we'll get
to that more in a second I do want to
walk through the case and its features
so here we go this video is brought to
you by Skillshare an online learning
community with over 25,000 classes and
business design and more so my favorite
classes include those pertaining to web
development and coding software is not
my strong suit by any means so I take
classes like this one a beginner's guide
to Python programming to get my foot in
the door and learn on my own time with
my favorite instructors I'm especially
excited because skill shares offering
viewers of science to do a full two
months of premium access totally free
for you to try out and explore and have
a feeling you will enjoy it click the
link below and get started today
first up in case you're wondering this
is a limited edition model so you can
get one of the 3,000 available this one
that was sent to me randomly is 2742
there's nothing particularly exciting
about that number at all I was hoping
for like two to two to dad have been
pretty cool and while we're up here it's
go and go through the front I oh we have
a fan controller here on the far left
USB 3.1 microphone jack headphone jack
power button pretty hard to click very
sturdy button we have a reset button we
also have a LED changer we'll get to
them on a second and then two USB 3.0
ports as for the front of the case see
it's pretty straightforward very bare
that's what they were going for a
minimalistic look we have to be quiet
logo down below it's slightly reflective
and then we have grills on the left and
right side these are black this time
around so it provides a great contrast
again
that white frame also led bars running
down both the left and whites the right
side and they also wrap underneath the
legs as well at least the front leg so
it's definitely a unique looking case
and when the LEDs are all lit up it
looks even more unique as for the top of
the case you can see it's very
minimalistic again I've been
disappointed with the air flow
properties of the top panel I emphasize
that in my previous review of this case
we do have slightly more grill space
back here but it's just it's not going
to allow air to naturally radiate easily
and that's really the only reason why
I'm disappointed with this now in case
you've never seen this chassis before
the entire thing is pretty much totally
modular which means you can remove all
these panels here you can slide those
all out you can completely pull them out
if you want and you can replace those
with hard drive cages one extra one is
included you have two more spaces down
below with which to use to mount hard
drives
you also have an SSD bracket behind the
motherboard tray great use of extra
space you can basically pull out the
entire basement you can flip the entire
case actually upside down we're not
going to do that for this bill just
because we want to keep things
consistent I'm not really a huge fan of
inverted builds but it is possible in
this case so if you like the kind of
modular support that some case
manufacturers throw in to their
different SKUs I mean this this could be
one for you it's not my cup of tea but
it's something that's worth mentioning
because not many cases allow you to do
this now the attention to detail with
respect to the painting it's pretty top
notch for the most part everywhere there
were a few places where you could see
that the spray just wasn't as thick so
over here toward the front it's gonna be
difficult to get on camera but you can
see that the original black chassis
underneath this wasn't sprayed very well
the good thing is this toward the front
it's kind of secluded so when you have
that glass panel on which I'll show you
guys in a second this really isn't easy
to see everywhere else though the paint
is pretty uniform throughout and you're
not gonna get the idea this was just
like DIY painted overnight in a backyard
you can see there are three large rubber
grommet cutouts here these are good for
24 pins you know SATA all that good
stuff you do have a thin slit down here
as well this is good for a USB 2.0 for
your front i/o connections maybe even HD
audio there's no dedicated HD audio slot
over here so you're gonna have to and I
run it through there it's kind of
difficult to get some of the cables to
fit through here so you might have to
push on the motherboard tray just a
little bit but that's kind of what they
expect you to do
and then up top we have a similar thing
a bit more space up here again you get a
route that 8-pin ups from the top so
it's it's gonna be a tight fit again but
it's I mean it's enough space to work
with I would say it's it's nothing
really to complain about just something
that you should know going into it
again I talked about these these are
module you can slide these further out
if you want you can even route cables
through these or you can remove these
altogether and place them with hard
drive trays like a Pepsi girl she's
tired she was playing a lot earlier
today or you can use a hard drive trays
like this one here and you can mount it
from the back and then you can actually
purchase more of these and have them
stack all the way up if you got for
whatever reason like eight hard drives
off of the back you can see the seven
dedicated PCIe slots horizontal
orientation and then we have two
vertical slots as well I don't recommend
putting just an air-cooled card up here
because you can see there's not much
clearance between these and the left
side panel so airflow is going to be
fairly restricted in that case but it's
something that you could use let's say
if you had like a graphics card with a
water block on it get a custom loop in
here this would be perfectly fine used
because it's a closed system so it's not
really going to matter how close it
comes to that left panel we have the
power supply bracket down here it's not
a removable bracket you have to load
everything in from the right side and
then further up you can see we have a
120 or 140 ml fan mount as well as the
rear motherboard IO cutout now behind
the motherboard tray things get pretty
fancy this is a fan hub and it does
support looks like one two three four
five six four pin fan headers so that
means they support PWM the two fans
included by the way our silent wings
three fans are top-of-the-line from be
quiet they're very very quiet even their
full load and they are PWM supported so
that is nice and they're both pre-wired
into this hub quite a bit of support
here you can even control whether you
want it running on silent or in
performance mode if you want things to
kick up when it's especially hot further
down just some more attention to detail
aspects I'm going to point out there are
rubber vibration mounts here for your
PSU to sit on that's great your power
supply has moving parts than it right
the fan prominently the fan actually
should be the only moving part but that
could cause your power supply to rattle
let's say it gets pretty hot under load
so you have these vibration mounts just
a yeah it's not necessary but it keeps
things especially quiet in a case like
this from a company like be quiet I mean
come on you gotta have that right
so it's nice it's there we have the two
hard drive trays here they are removable
via thumb screws that's convenient and
there's plenty of space you can see you
have a huge power supply and you'll
still have space to pack those extra
cables and even more toward the front if
you're just dying for some extra space
now as for cable management you see
we've got a whole bunch of cables here
stashed and there's about an inch worth
of clearance which means that you're
really not going to have an issue you
even with custom cable extensions which
will add significantly more bulk to this
side of the case you're not gonna have
an issue trying to pack that right side
panel on the other things to point out
you can see they made use of the extra
space behind the motherboard tray by
including an SSD bracket that is
removable via a single thumb screw it's
very convenient I also have an extra SSD
tray down here next to the fan
controller and that's pretty much it
trying to make sure I cover everything I
know this is a very rough review before
we get to the thermals but I want to
build that system so we can throw it in
here and start running some tests
because I don't believe I've actually
run official temperature tests with it
maybe I did but I didn't keep it
consistent so it's gonna be interesting
to see how this compares to other cases
in the future that's why I want to start
with this one first so let's go ahead
and build the the system we're gonna
throw in here it's not going to be a
white themed build I'm not gonna put as
much effort into making this look like
you know absolutely mint like I try to
do with my other builds and that's just
because we want to test thermals that's
all I'm worried about I want to see how
restrictive these front grilles are and
I also want to see how loud the case
gets when the system is under full load
so not further ado I've got this diluted
8700 k here I know it looks like
absolute trash long story short I was
using liquid metal underneath the IHS
and above the IHS which is why it looks
kind of messy I've tried my best to
clean that up but it is deleted I am
using thermal grizzly compound
underneath but we'll be using just you
know regular old thermal paste between
the IHS and the CPU cooler we're going
to use I have a gigabyte a Z 370 or ass
motherboard right here this is going to
look really nice with our CPU cooler
which is going to be the B quiet dark
rock for now realize this is the first
time to actually see my face in this
video but I'm going to get the rest of
the parts ready to go I'm gonna give you
just a quick little build long just kind
of speed things up and then we will run
the test and that
be basically the conclusion of the video
showing you guys how we built the the
test bench if you will for all of our
case reviews going forward and then also
revealing the temperatures of this case
which we'll use as our baseline for case
reviews here
all right so hope you guys at least uh
enjoyed the build process now it's not
the prettiest looking building I think
this is look significantly better when
we have black chassis to build in so if
you want to buy a white case I recommend
pairing at least something else with it
that maybe has like a white accent or
that is white in its entirety white
motherboards will look especially good
in this because the internals are also
white but anyway we're more or less
focused on the thermosphere and we're
gonna keep this again very consistent
going forward I still wanted to show you
guys how we actually ran these tests I
know some channels won't tell you
exactly how they run certain tests
because they want it to be their own
things kind of proprietary in a sense
but I want to tell you guys exactly how
I run all these tests so that you can go
out and do them on your own and then
double check my results and compare them
with cases you may have laying around
cuz I might not get around it testing
every case out there right so I want to
be very upfront and disclosed exactly
how I do this I used the burnin test I
linked it down below and then I only ran
the 3d test the 3d graphics as well as
the CPU I didn't touch any of the
internal settings there I just ran both
of those for 30 minutes each actually
they run together so both the graphics
card and the CP are being stressed
simultaneously which will put the
heaviest load on the case and that's
where air flow will truly matter so with
the front panel on the CPU reached
72 point 2 degrees Celsius under load
and the GPU reached 57.0 and then with
the front panel off the CPU touch 68
point 3 C and the GPU was at 56 so only
a 1 degree Celsius drop with a graphics
card by removing the front panel has to
be expected that card is placed to the
back and it has access to to air from
the back of the case because it is
slightly porous and then for the CPU it
was about a four degree reduction this
is pretty run-of-the-mill
nothing too exceptional means that the
front panel is it is definitely reducing
the amount of air that gets to the case
or the amount of uncharged air that
reaches the cooler but it's nothing too
significant I would say it would be a
big deal if this was an 8 degree Delta
but 4 degrees isn't too bad seventy two
point two versus sixty eight point three
and again the front panel is going to be
the
the prime determiner therefore how hot
and CPU gets because that is where most
of the air that is fed to the CPU cooler
comes in to the case apart from that I
wanted to show you a few more shots of
the case with the build in it also with
the RGB Zhan I think this is one of the
best implementations of RGB in a case to
date that I've seen fantex does it very
well as well now the dark bass 700 black
will be the one that I list down below
unless I can find links to the white one
it goes on sale today or at least I
think today is the NDA lift so it should
be on sale soon and if it's not linked
down below I will definitely link at
least a dark base 700 black model and
you can get that and I think a few
different trims I'm not sure if they're
offering the orange grey and black trims
but I know the one that I have is silver
so that that one definitely isn't one
you can buy in terms of price I don't
think it's gonna be too overboard it's
it's one of those that you're really
paying for the premium like the sound
damping material right you're getting
that tempered glass panel I love that on
the white it's trimmed in white a lot of
white cases will have this trim on the
tempered glass in black and it just
doesn't look very good when the rest of
the components are white when the rest
of the frame is white so be quiet its
attention to detail here is top notch
you're paying for it it's not gonna be
cheap by any means but I still think
it's a contender out there and that sub
$200 price range it's not gonna break
the bank but at the same time it's not
gonna be something I would want to throw
a bunch of budget parts in just because
it wouldn't really make sense I'd rather
you allocate that extra money there's
something that's going to really matter
when it comes to gaming and content
creation either a better CPU more RAM or
a better graphics card with that I'd
like to know in the comments below what
you guys think about be quiet its new
take on the dark bass 700 we saw it at
Computex and I think Kyle built in it so
I'm excited now that I finally got a
build in it I mean it's basically the
same case of 700 black model but the
white one just to me it just looks so
elegant and then when paired with these
RGB accents as well going all the way
around the front panel it's just
top-notch anyway I know my opinion is
the only one out there so let me know
what you guys think in the comments
below if you like this video the thumbs
up I appreciate it thumbs down for the
opposite feeling or okay I hate
everything about life looking at red
subscribe if you haven't already stay
tuned for more case thermal reviews
we're gonna be adding to our list I know
this is only like you know the first
case here but the more that we test case
is I'm gonna actually when we come back
from our vacation we're going on
tomorrow I'm going to run through about
a dozen or so cases tests all of those
were the exact same components that will
have a huge chart so you can see how all
of them stack up in terms of air flow in
terms of thermals we'd like to get into
that game as well so stay tuned for all
that this is science studio thanks for
watching thanks for learning us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
