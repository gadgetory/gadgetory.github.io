the title already you have a good idea
what I'm going to talk about here but I
am going to be using Rison for my daily
editing gaming PC this is the system
behind me I expect a few things will
change
I build pcs and tear them down like the
next week and I still have Walter White
three by the way that one's not
destroyed yet it's still a good
functioning PC but there are some in
practicalities involved with X 299 I
haven't been found about that I think
that the platform is extremely
overpriced I think that some other CPUs
don't even make sense or should not
exist but even though I had the AI 970
100x in Walter White 3 I'm going to be
personally using the horizon 1,700 X
because I think it's a much more
practical CPU and I want to kind of set
the example not necessarily people are
looking up to me but I think that if I'm
going to promote the best price to
performance CPU on the market or you
know a group of CPUs that are decent for
the money
then I should be using those myself and
that's why I've been using an i7 6700 K
for so long that CPU is great for me and
I've had a 5820k 6900 K a lot of CPUs
that are you know just higher core
counts maybe higher frequency is what
have you but I've just been very
comfortable tuned i7 because I feel like
that's all I need for what I do so I'm
not going to just show off an eye 970
100x and say hey check this out I've got
the CPU oh by the way it makes no sense
but I'm going to use it anyway but
that's not what I want the channel to be
about I want it to be about the best
bang for the buck that's what I founded
the channel on and I think that rise in
7 and rise in 5 for that matter now our
excellent choices for those who are
budget conscious at the same time who
want the most for their money who want
the most power that they can get for
what they're paying the horizon 7 1700
is right now the best performance per
dollar right and 7 CPU only because you
you don't really get an extra 500
megahertz of overclocking Headroom with
the 1800 X it just doesn't happen you
you be lucky if you get a well Bend 1800
XO to get you to 4.1 4.2 gigahertz good
luck I'd say one or two percent of you
will get that decent of an overclock and
be able to keep it cool enough with like
a 240 ml a IO something along those
lines and even with this custom cooler
here and my right
seven 1700 X I still I can barely hit
four gigahertz that's with a whopping
one point four or five volts that's a
lot of voltage maybe recommends around
one point three five they say anything
above that they're not really
recommending so in order to keep the
voltage under control if I want this to
last me in the long run and I have to
worry too much about the CP failing I've
kept this one at one point three seven
volts and three point eight two
gigahertz I think I think three point
nine gigahertz it was cool and Cinebench
failed a night of 64 so it will probably
fail in video rendering too so three
point eight right now again the
motherboard can handle much higher than
that but it really just comes down to
the CPU how well bend it is mine's not
in that grade but three point eight
gigahertz across eight cores and 16
threads it's pretty solid and like I
said I did build the system only for
gaming in fact I probably video edit
more than I played video games just
because I don't have a lot of time to do
the latter so I think that this chip
right here is going to serve me very
well it is an upgrade from the i7 6700 K
from a video editing standpoint the
eight cores are phenomenal in video
editing I do get a marginal decrease in
rendering time for a five-minute 1080p
60fps video file I always show the same
file on the same rendering time so you
can see across the board here which CPU
is the best by far and when you consider
the price of the 1700 or in this case of
1700 X it is the better buy for content
creators over the i7 6700 K now in terms
of gaming there's nothing wrong with
gaming on the Rison 7 CPL say that up
front the framerate drop that I've
experienced converting from the i7 to r7
is rather marginal that may be a 10 15
FPS Delta or and in 1440p expect it to
be a bit more in 1080p because it's a
little more CPU intensive and and then
IPC starts to really take hold there a
lot of games are still relying on
primarily 4 cores so having the extra 4
is just future-proofing at this point
although we've been saying that since
bulldozer that's an entirely different
argument but the marginal FPS Delta is
nowhere near enough to make me regret
switching from the i7 2007 it's just an
all around better CPU and especially for
the price I would say though that a few
select titles are still preferring SMT
be disabled that's essentially the
hyper-threading equivalent for Rison
simultaneous multi-threading so instead
of just having a physical cores you have
eight cores and 16 threads more about
hyper threading SMT is kind of the same
way in this video right here so
by cops three is one game that I've
noticed that experiences rather
infrequent FPS drops in the middle of
gaming's all hover around 150 160 fps in
1440p max settings with the 210 80s in
here and then if I I don't know do
something that's pretty intensive on the
CP side some kind of physics aspect of
the game and explosion maybe particles
whatnot if you get into a place where
it's pretty heavy on the CPU it will
drop immediately down to maybe 50 60 fps
and then spike right back up to the
consistent 130 150 you know around there
and I found that if I disable SMT I
don't have any spikes any drops
whatsoever it's very consistent and that
just comes down to optimization the
developers haven't really adjusted yet
to the new rising architecture very
complicated technical things that are
honestly beyond me going to play that
caused those spikes but I would say that
in most titles you're going to be just
fine black ops 3 is an exception it's
just one that I've noticed so if you do
play game like that I would check forms
that's where I found out that that was
what was causing my random spikes and
when I say spikes but random dips in fps
just check those if you play maybe two
or three games you want to switch to
rise them that could be something worth
considering disabling SMT and if all you
do is play games and that's what you
would get just a more consistent frame
rate than it's worth disabling but for
the most part like I keep saying you're
going to be okay if you just leave it as
is maybe give yourself a solid overclock
and you should be good to go other than
that I'm very happy with the build it's
it's not primed yet I don't you can hear
like the fluid Turing and there's some
air bubbles still on the radiator so I
need to flip the PC around a bit let
that thing Prime and then it should be a
bit quieter but the build looks I think
it looks solid considering I build this
in like a day and a half I mean it's
kind of scrapped it together last minute
because I wanted to make the point that
you look you don't need a thousand
dollar CPU to be comfortable editing
content creating and playing video games
at the same time Rison seven and even I
would argue rise in five those are both
excellent CPU lineups for just an
all-around computer enthusiast and
that's why I'm going to be using the
1700 X as my daily driver of course with
210 ATS in there that's a bit overkill
but I would say a single 1070 1080 or
1080 TI will do just fine in most
resolutions with that if you like this
video or at least appreciate the honesty
and switch be sure to give this one a
thumbs up I appreciate it give it a
thumbs down if you feel you can put off
it'd be sure to click subscribe but if
you have an RA in stay tuned for I have
an interesting experiment coming up
something happened to one of my 1080 T
eyes keeps overheating it gets extremely
hot immediately under load and I know
for a fact that that water block is on
there as it should be so I think I'm
going to remove the water block put the
air cooler back on and see if we
experience the same spikes could just be
a PCB issue we'll find out this is
