studio and I would like for you to meet
the fantex evolved ITX case though it
only supports mini ITX motherboards it
does boast a powerful wide stance plenty
of space for radiators and a large power
supply and along in a form factor to
support even the most ostentatious of
graphics cards that's pretty cool you
don't see those kinds of things in
typical ITX cases especially those cube
cases that I think are just hideous so
starting from the front and working our
way around the exterior we have a
removable white panel which gives way to
a very large 200 millimeter fan the fan
itself is removable and the mounting
chassis of which supports a 240
millimeter radiator comfortably the
front IO consists of two USB 3.0 ports a
headphone jack and a microphone jack as
well as a hard disk drive led the front
panel allows for acceptable air flow
between its sides and top and is
removable giving way to the very large
200 millimeter fan mentioned earlier it
provides plenty of breathable air this
is only a three pin fan so when you plug
this into your ITX motherboards fan
header it's pretty much it's gonna run
at full speed no matter what I'd let you
do some hardcore tweaking onto the top
you'll find a very sturdy power button
with a satisfying travel distance not
too far and behind that to the sides are
small grilled openings for any case fans
or additional radiators you might happen
to have lying around the right side of
the case is plain and removable of
course while the left side of the case
features an intricate window allowing
for excellent views of all your goodies
including but not limited to the power
supply down below the full length of
your graphics card - the little cage
that I'll talk about here in a sec the
motherboard and cooler and even a
mountable solid-state drive the fantex
logo on the removable Kage shelf I don't
know we'll call it a shelf it's you can
call it either one but it's removable
that's the most important thing is also
visible through this window so that's a
nice added touch the bottom of the case
provides plenty of air passages with its
several grilles and openings and even
features a removable mesh under the
power supply for catching that unwanted
dust be sure in the case of this case to
have your power supplies fan facing
downward for access to filtered
err the case itself stands above the
surface a few centimeters supported by
four sturdy legs at the base the rear of
the case features its only two expansion
slots space for a 140 or 120 millimeter
fan or a fan radiator combo the rear i/o
space of course and an opening at the
bottom for the power supply now on to
the goodies and the inside of the case
removing the left side panel reveals
plenty of space
probably more than you'll ever need
unless you plan on water cooling
absolutely everything in there but the
beauty of this case is that it gives you
the opportunity to if you want to and
even if you're not somebody who likes
the water cool and just prefers air
cooling all around it's I mean it's
cheaper then you're not going to be
disappointed with how much space is left
over just because of how good everything
looks when it's set up inside the ITX
motherboard mounts vertically some ITX
cases have the motherboard you know
sitting flat and then the graphics card
sitting vertically but that's not the
case here it's just like any typical ATX
or mid 80 X Tower a very cool feature of
this case that I like that you don't see
too often honestly are the rubber doors
in several places for excellent cable
management even hide those strands of
cables that just kind of find their way
inside the opening of the case that
everyone would see through the window
now as I said earlier the shelf
containing the fantex logo is removable
however its presence in the case won't
interfere with the graphics card it
actually sticks out a lot further than
the card would when it's inserted so you
don't have to worry about an
interference between the two unless you
have like an insanely beefy graphics
card which I don't think exists not one
that big the worst case you pull the
shelf out I think yeah shelf we're gonna
call it shelf now atop the shelf are
four mounting pins capable of holding a
single solid-state drive you could
probably also manage to mount a hard
drive in this location but I don't know
that would just look a little too
trihard ish right I would like to have
seen an optional removable cage here
kind of resting on top of the shelf that
would be that would be something that I
think would be nice because then if you
had more than one solid-state drive that
you wanted to put a top to show off that
wouldn't be a problem we don't have that
but it's okay at least you can put one
up there I like showing off my
as these so being able to put one up
there is pretty cool now speaking of
storage on the opposite side of the
tower you'll find a caged stuff down
below on the same levels of power supply
basically and here you'll find space for
two more either three and a half inch or
two and a half inch drives while we're
back here you'll find a large opening
for custom cooling mounts as well as
plenty of clearance for cables to be run
up the side of the case I should also
note that both of the side panels
feature the thumb screws so it's you
know relatively easy to remove both side
panels which is nice you don't have to
go and fetch a screwdriver every time
you want to tweak with something in the
case included with the case as well as a
box filled with some brackets some
screws and even a few zip ties just to
make things look nice and orderly in
there but you don't get that included
you know large plastic container with
all the dividers with special little you
know particular screws and whatnot that
you would normally get in the full-size
ATX and micro ATX versions of this
fantex evolved case no big deal though
because of the price cut with their ITX
version is actually pretty substantial
so I'm not gonna be picky for that stuff
just know that you won't get anything
fancy like that you would normally get
with a fan Tex case of this caliber now
with everything assembled inside and the
addition of the modest LED lighting kit
that I've also added expect to wow your
guests family and friends and even
yourself the large window on such a
small case is a great thing to see and
encourages enthusiasts to try their best
to beautify the technology inside so all
in all I would give this case a 9 out of
10 the price is on point that's probably
the coolest thing about this case it
costs about as much as an NZXT s340
but you're getting a much smaller more
compact version of a similar case and
from a noteworthy brand the features of
this case matched similar micro ATX and
full sized ATX towers just from the
sheer size of this ITX case in
particular and everything inside was you
can just tell it was thoroughly thought
through the paint job was great the
connections are secure and concise and I
mean come on it's a fan text case the
only thing I would have liked to have
seen a bit more of is case consolidation
so there's plenty of space for radiators
for
large CPU coolers whatever you would
like to install in there that you would
normally be able to fit into a regular
ATX case you could probably fit into
this case as well that's just one of the
trade-offs is going with a larger ITX
case I do think though that they could
have shrunk down a few things the
distance between the front of the
graphics card and the window there's
like three inches there there's a lot of
wasted space that I think could have
been consolidated into an even smaller
ITX form factor so maybe not get rid of
this case but give a smaller version of
this ITX case to those who wish to have
a more compact system I don't know
I don't design cases but I do think it
would be nice to see something smaller
than this and the ITX form factor from
fantex just you know so that you're not
limiting your fan base to people who
want something large but small at the
same time it seems a little oxymoronic
to have a very large ITX case I don't
know just be a picky I keep going back
to this though it is awesome to see such
a nice case at such an attractive price
the white option is a great option the
addition of the window is always a plus
in my book and the overall durability of
the case thus far at least into its
lifespan is spot-on
if you're considering a 90 X build in
the near future and are all that
concerned about you know space
consolidation then consider the fantex
of all ITX remember I don't get paid for
these reviews I pay for these things out
of the science studio budget so I'm not
being persuaded to say any one
particular thing about any case this is
just my raw impressions of the building
experience that I had with the case and
just how I think it looks in general but
all in all I think this case has a a lot
of potential and is overall just a great
product so that's about it if owned we
