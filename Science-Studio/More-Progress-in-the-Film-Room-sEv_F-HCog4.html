progress in the film room you can say I
have the frame for what will be
eventually a green-screen will be
filming most of our like how-to and
instructional informative videos in here
and I think some of the more hands-on
stuff we'll probably do on this desk but
you want to do is stand about three to
four feet in front of the green screen
itself so that you're not you know
pressed against it and creating a shadow
which will be really bad for when you're
trying to I use ultra key a chroma key
whatever to change the color of the
background and if we're going to be
using 4k and was gonna crop the image
just a little bit so yeah you can see
right inside the frame and that's the
point so we're gonna need that green
screen itself which is over here alright
so this is what is known as muslin this
is kind of like a bed sheet of sorts but
it's pretty thick it's actually really
heavy too and you want this to be not
transparent at all because when you do
go into editing later on and you find
that it is transparent you have weird
colors kind of washed out in the
background assuming that your wall is
not just a uniform color then you're
gonna have a really bad time in
production now rule number one I'm not
gonna practice what I preach because I
don't have one with me I just you know I
could just moved into here and I still
have a lot of stuff to buy you want to
iron this you want this to be as flat as
possible you don't want any wrinkles
because those will create micro shadows
and again very hard to get out
post filming so this has just a little
opening a little speed that goes all the
way through and we're gonna thread this
part up top on the bar all the way
across well let it hang down now to
compensate for the lack of an iron I'm
gonna hope these clips reach on these
you know these are these are kind of
sure they're not sticking out very far
from the pole and I think that the frame
is 10 feet wide and the muscle has only
9 feet wide but yeah whatever worst case
I'll just take it down later and iron it
but I do want to set it up and see kind
of what it looks like start playing
around with the ultra key effect in
Adobe Premiere Pro and get used to
making things look super fancy so that
further ado let's go ahead and set this
thing up
all right so after some ironing which I
didn't bother filming because you know
who wants to watch them on that iron
something I've got this thing pretty
much the way I want it now the lights
aren't super powerful for this I was
hoping they'd be a bit brighter in here
they're not which means that there's a
slight shadow here in the middle and
you're probably wondering why the camera
is so close actually a macro little lens
fitted to the front of Sarabhai the
autofocus to the front of this camera so
I can stand you know but like a foot and
a half away from the lens in my whole
body will be in the shot and just
because it's a wide-angle lens of sorts
so if I stand kind of you know there
about I'd say a foot and a half maybe to
two feet away from the lens then there
isn't a shadow generated behind me
there's a slight one but we'll talk
about that in a second ultra key with
premiere and the lights are far enough
apart that the shadows really don't show
up and tell about a foot away from the
muslin so I think it's kind of weird
saying muslin it sounds awfully close to
Muslim and then I feel really weird I
think that if I use the center light
here I'll turn that on and it should
brighten up the the foreground and
that's exactly what I'm looking for to
keep me bright because these lights are
pretty far away from me so what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna go ahead and insert
the SD card and I'm gonna start filming
from the other side so that you can
watch the screen kind of see what things
look like that way you have an idea of
you know how bright things need to be in
the background you can see right now I
just kind of zoom in on this screen it's
really awkward doing like a two camera
thing here so the background is is a
decently lit I'm not too bright right
now because the lights aren't shining
directly on me so I can do is turn on
this front light and things will
brighten up lots a little too bright a
little overexposed there things will
brighten up in the foreground I look
super pasty on that screen but I promise
you I'm not I'm not overexposed in real
life and we'll go ahead and start
filming so what we'll do is we'll take
this footage and we will throw it into
premiere and you'll be able to see I'll
just capture my screen they're able to
see exactly what I do to get rid of the
green background behind me and instead
replace it with like black or gray well
if I don't want to use black somewhere
in a black shirt - so - so maybe we can
do like a gray color or just completely
you know go out there with like pink or
some
thing but the whole point is as long as
it's evenly lit and it's not like to in
focus you kind of want to blur the
background out and you don't want a lot
of shadows you also don't want to move
super fast if I like wave my hand back
and forth in a premiere you'll be able
to see just slight grains of green
that's because the ultra key tool can't
keep up with those fast motion so when
you're standing in front of a green
screen it's really only good for talking
and and slow movements movements are
predictable really fast ones will pose a
problem for the software all right now
we're gonna cut this SD card let's bring
it back with us turn this light off
because it's all battery-powered right
now and we will plug in the SD card all
right you see I am this was my first
test clip right here's the second one
so I'm going to switch now to the screen
capture so you'll see that instead of
this awkward camera facing a screen
alright so we have our clip on the
desktop doesn't matter where you put it
just keep things nice and orderly so you
know exactly where to go if you want
your resources at your fingertips we're
gonna open up Premiere Pro and I'm gonna
show you exactly what to do to start
working with your green screen so I have
a previous video clip here or a previous
project I want to open up slide the clip
into the timeline and then we're gonna
click effects up top and I'm going to go
to video effects and key and then we're
gonna left-click on ultra Keys slide it
over to the clip and nothing's gonna
happen at first because what we have to
do is click this tool on the left side a
key color we're gonna use that little
drop tool and we want to select an area
in this clip window that is pretty green
pretty kind of standard throughout you
don't want a darker shade of green
because then it'll start warping the
lighter colors and there seems to be a
lighter distribution here than there is
dark also you can kind of see the shadow
behind my head that's not good so we
need to adjust our lights of it to get
rid of that or I need to stand further
away from the green screen so let's
select a pretty standard color here this
looks to be pretty good and there you go
look boom so we have a black background
now but it's not perfect you can see we
have some light shades in here if you
have a muslin especially you're gonna
have these issues unless your lighting
is just perfect spot-on or unless you're
standing really far away from the
green-screen so what I suggest doing
come over to the left
matte clean up we can soften things
that'll kind of better distribute the
the shades of
light and then midpoint we can jump that
all the way up and then contrast which
will help with a black background boom
now it's almost all completely gone and
we will watch the playback now to see if
it is in fact good enough for production
now one thing I want to point out like I
said earlier because my hands are moving
pretty fast when you'll see they're just
hanging in front of the green screen
you might see a bit of a green shade
around my fingers if they're moving very
fast that's because the ultra key tools
having problems with interpolating that
green and changing it to black
especially when it's happening for a
split second so when you're standing in
front of a green screen like this be
sure not to move super fast I can see
what I'm doing there with my hand it's
you just get the idea that there's
something that's not black behind me
it's it's green and that's the downfall
of using a green screen technology like
this it's not perfect just don't move
super fast and you shouldn't have any
major issues another thing I want to do
is check hardware utilization I want to
see if this is using the graphics card
at all I'm not sure then never use this
tool so while we are in playback
let's check the CP utilization a few
cores are being used pretty heavily it's
there on 30 40 percent that's pretty
standard though I mean there are a few
extra percentage points here for using
the electric key effect but not too bad
and on the graphics card side we have
utilization here of a whopping 2% all
right now this point I should clarify
what we're really doing with the ultra
key tool is deleting the background in
essence what we're doing is selecting
the color that we want deleted in ultra
key is rendering that background
basically like a blank image and a PNG
file so we don't have anything now
behind me or close to anything I would
say that these shadows are gonna be an
issue but what we can do instead of just
having a black plain background is
sliding in an image like this one here
now look at there your boys
semi-transparent with a shirt because
we're a bit aggressive with the with the
settings over here to the left so what
we can do instead we can choose some
presets aggressive is pretty good it's
not too bad anymore used to be pretty
bad but now it's not
too bad you can see there my shirt is
good let's go ahead and play back and
see how accurate things look oh yeah
looking great and we're not seeing any
green smudges or dots around my hair
that's usually where it becomes obvious
this is pretty good you can see when I
move my hands there's a slight green
tint that's just something you'll be a
pickup in production again a downfall of
using a low-quality setup here but this
should be okay for most of what I do
well there you have it I will say pretty
simple to set up I've never worked with
a green-screen before and the software
is fairly forgiving so even if you don't
have a perfect like production setup
perfect green-screen if you're not
painting a wall and it's super smooth
and and evenly lit across the entire
canvas you can still probably get away
with some some of those errors in
Premiere Pro especially with the ultra
key tool but chroma key in general is
pretty good now the software's in a long
way and it is fairly forgiving for those
who are wondering I have the products
linked in the video description for this
setup here spend about a hundred bucks
on the green-screen frame and all it's a
pretty pretty good investment I would
say the muslin is pretty thick I
wouldn't recommend going with a cheap
one because they are transparent that
could pose a problem in production and
kind of working with it now I can see
why because if the light's not evenly
distributed and then like you have like
a semi dark wall or her pain to your
walls aren't very smooth or maybe have
something behind the wall then you're
gonna have a pretty rough time in
software like premiere if you liked this
video be sure to give this one a thumbs
up I appreciate it thumbs down for the
opposite key to subscribe but if you
haven't written stay tuned for more
content like this don't worry it won't
be all on the green-screen it's not
going to be super fake only use it when
necessary
