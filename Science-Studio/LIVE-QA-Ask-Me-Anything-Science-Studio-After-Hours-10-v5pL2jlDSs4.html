the traditional Mic Check here so I will
be looking for all of you to tell me
whether or not I am too low or too high
and annoying it's so awkward watching
myself pause there but I'm getting used
to it right if it says it's live it's
live it just takes a while right for it
to stream to YouTube so I would explain
why we have a bit of an awkward pause
there I'm just checking the chat then
I'm sure that this is all figured out
right I don't want to be Mike's working
well that's I know that Mike's working
but I mean like is it the too loud you
don't be picky it's it's fine you know
I've just I just want to get as good as
I can at the beginning of this stream
that way we don't have people coming in
later I mean like what are the stream
stone-like crap and that's that's all me
so uh cubby you say okay I see one
person said that sound too low most you
say I sound fine so I will take that at
face value Mason if I'm too low just
turn me turn me up a little bit more I
promise I won't get too loud and I'm
sorry if the audio kind of Peaks up and
down that's not supposed to happen I
don't know why that happens I use a
sound board and the sound boards not
doing that so it's something soft or
related I'll get to the bottom of that
soon if it does happen I apologize okay
thank you for thanks Alex and all of you
guys for letting me know the mic is fine
I appreciate that this is another Q&amp;amp;A
livestream we do this every Sunday night
at approximately 9 p.m. CST I gotta tell
you guys actually little story to kick
this one off I have built a 2700 X rig
so Rison plus or whatever rise in second
generation top-of-the-line cpu here and
this thing is using the stock cooler
that comes with the 2700 X so it's the I
figure what it's calls not the is it the
prism I think but it's the RGB cooler
it's pretty beefy I mean I got CPU or
not CPU it's got a copper piping and
aluminum fins a good combo there now
something you don't see an Intel cool or
as much any
or if you even get one and then until
CPE Bach's but this one's actually
pretty sweet-looking I'll be sure to
cover that in the video and it's not too
loud either you know I have it running
at the stock thing so it's just gonna
kind of boost a xfr I'm trying to
remember I think it's exif or that kind
of just turbos it above the turbo
frequency on the box and so it's kind of
doing its thing right now every now and
that gets a little loud
again I'm encoding you know at with 4000
it's per second I think so that's okay
for 1080p stream and I'm using a webcam
so nothing's gonna be looking that great
anyway to being honest but uh this is
just me kind of testing it out trying to
see how it runs how it streams because I
haven't actually like done a full on
live stream in real life with this thing
yet even a few streaming tests with the
CPU but nothing to this extent so I want
to see how comfortable the stream is
with the CPU I imagine it weren't
perfectly fine we're talking eight cores
16 threads this thing will hit 4.2
gigahertz across one or two cores you
know just kind of spontaneously and so
yeah this is more or less again just an
experiment and so thank you all for
watching tuning in this late Sunday a
Sunday night or Monday morning depending
on where you live it's Monday morning
geez kudos to you for that I don't know
how you found time in your schedule but
I appreciate it approximately a hundred
20 people watching right now you guys
are awesome I see your questions I'm
gonna scroll up and start from where I
think gets the prism cooler prism thanks
windowed appreciate that hit all the
different cooler names from AMD CPUs
mixed up alright anyway let's see here
oh I see Adam Stephenson loved the
content man I appreciate that Adam
thanks for stopping by
Sami s Sami sigh I think I'm gonna say
Sammy's died some time ago you made a
review on cryo rig are they truly worth
investing one thanks in advance I've
made a few of exam few reviews on
cryocoolers cryo rig makes beautiful
coolers I think that some of the best in
the business all around I think they're
they're pretty much on par in my book
with be quiet coolers just from the
sense that like ok they're not going to
be typically as quiet as be quiet
coolers
you know those silent ones 3
fans are gonna be some of the best out
there but they are going to look as good
if not better than be quite coolers in
some instance like the quad Lumi for
example the h7 quad roomie is a
beautiful cooler I've been waiting to do
a full-on review of that cooler but I
love the quad Lumi the c1 which is that
really big top flow cooler that's a
beautiful one the c7 everyone uses an
ITX coolers are ITX pc bolts I love the
c7 as well so yeah cry rigs is
definitely a brand that I would go to
and consider strongly for a CPU cooler
scrolling down here
Anand asks why AMD cards are less
popular than nvidia cards part of that
has to do right now with with the
preference miners have towards AMD cards
who they're just better miners so it's
harder to find cheaper and B cards for
the equivalent power that you otherwise
would have with an AMD with an nvidia
card also vega 56 and 64 were kind of
flops they didn't really do what they
expected them to do they weren't as
popular because they were so expensive
right of the gate they launched him
around the same time that mining just
took off so that was a big reason as
well I think people expected a lot more
than what they got with Vega 56 and 64 I
think the overhyping there kind of
killed the vibe a little bit as well
people in general like in my personal
experience I see people favoring Nvidia
drivers nvidia geforce experience more
than I see people favor relive drivers
or Crimson drivers the the experience
itself having people a little more
familiar with it
GeForce has changed quite a bit I prefer
the old GeForce experience but I like
shadow play it's very easy to use a very
low profile and I think in my
experiences as well just personally the
the software side of things i think
nvidia is still at a slight advantage
and so if I'm if I had to pick let's say
between an AMD card in a video card that
are the same level right I would choose
the AMD card because typically AMD cards
are gonna be a little less expensive for
the same amount of power I mean look at
our x4 85 80 versus a 10 60 the 10 60
was always in the mid to upper 200s the
four eighties and five eighties were
low 200s which made it I mean those were
better value graphics cards for sure and
you had about the same performance but
if you're dealing more or less with the
software side and you record a lot of
gameplay or game footage with the
built-in software you do a lot of stuff
in GeForce experience and in those
crimson drivers and overclocked ability
all that stuff I think that NVIDIA has
an edge on the software side and that's
just coming from somebody who has again
switched between these a lot I work with
both cards you know both vendors a lot
or manufacturers a lot and I just I
prefer Nvidia software not to say that I
prefer Nvidia cards in general I just
prefer Nvidia software but I think AMD
just like they do in the CP market does
have in a normal market the the edge
when it comes to value they don't charge
you that Nvidia tax that everyone is so
so hell-bent on bringing up ok sh x baby
BBY don't hit that - is that 2 pounds
I'm trying to get my units right here
that is 2 pounds I appreciate that super
chat donation can you link your personal
PC build please or make one I have all
my personal build to go up on the go up
in on videos in the channel so I've
typed in science to do PC build those
have been all my personal builds I use
all of them personally when they when
they go live or when I build them I film
them all basically so you'll find them
all on the channel this one here that
I'm talking about that I'm streaming
with right now I haven't filmed yet
you'll see that video coming very soon
nubs easy 11 I guess that's what I'm
gonna say it is then for that $9.99
super chap my dude hey Greg just want to
let you know that your videos really got
me into building pcs into the Beast PC
building world I'm 90% done with my
first build and I'll be sure to post
lots of pics in the discourse dude I
appreciate that
speaking of which thanks for bringing up
the discord because so what we do with
this cord is we link that to our patreon
because I feel like you know we could
have like an open disc or two right and
I'm sure we'd have hundreds of people in
it we did that with steam and it was
just kind of too much for me especially
to keep up with a lot of people were
sending messages and asking questions
and I just didn't feel like I could
I couldn't really focus on all of all
the people who wanted attention and then
some people would get upset because I
don't respond to them and I just feel
like the way we have to set up now is
probably for the best and it's not
because I want money I just think that
it kind of narrows down the playing
field so that I can be more attended
with people who actually do want to
contribute in some other way
so the discord is linked to patreon you
only got to donate like a dollar if you
want to be in it and there's $1 a month
which you know you get a set if that's
worth it T or not if you know this isn't
your favorite channel it's you're
probably not gonna want to pay it all
our month but I feel like what we do
here and you like getting involved on
science to it you can do so so I'm
logging into the discord right now
because I want to I want to check and
make sure nobody's asking questions in
this chord because I want to give this
cord viewers preference not I'm not
gonna just you know ignore everyone else
in this in the chat but I want to make
sure that I'm that I'm seeing this
correctly when we're looking at here
no okay so anyway I'm gonna minimize
that I'm gonna pull this back up here
how are you all doing out there thank
you to thee I can't see anything right
now 228 people watching you guys are
crazy it's a Sunday night what are you
doing with your lives
definitely not Snowden that is a epic
name there he asks will I have a
bottleneck if I pair an overclocked 3.9
gigahertz fork or four thread 2200 G
with a gtx 1070 TI right off the bat I
am almost certain that will be a
bottleneck 1080 is gonna be a bottleneck
and the 1070 TI is not it's not a huge
jump down right from a 1080 I'm in some
cases like you see I got a blower style
1080 that didn't turbo very high because
it just got so hot right because Nvidia
kind of scales frequencies according to
GPU temps and memory temps the the jump
down isn't substantial enough to justify
that purchase over a 1080 if you're
worried about a bottleneck both are
gonna be I would argue it just as much
of a bottleneck to each other in
reference to the CPU which is severe
under kill so I mean if you want to look
at it like
you know you're you got you had an APU
right a 2200 G if you're gonna buy a
2200 G you probably don't want to spend
six hundred five hundred dollars in that
1070 TIR 1080 so you know you might want
to just instead of out for a twenty two
hundred G go for something like an r5
1400 r5 1600 would be your best bet and
it's a better combination there but
pairing it with a arisin APU it just
doesn't really make sense
let's see Merkley asks after you after
your experience with the Galax white
cards you mean off white card the 1070
anyway would you still recommend it I
also live in Canada so I'd have to buy a
used one on eBay are they worth the
hassle
yeah look if you're paying a little
under MSRP like if you're gonna use
Galax card in my experience and I've I
had a 1070 Galax card it was a sniper
card and then I have a 1070 TI sniper
white card and look both were both ran
fine I was really impressed with how
quiet the cards were and how how high
you could overclock manually above the
just the out-of-the-box frequencies
there so they're great cards actually
and most of them use custom PCB so
they're you know adding boards and they
do really well on the overclocking and
thermal sides of things so the coolers
are effective and they're generally not
more not much more expensive than like a
mainstream EVGA card or gigabyte card
what-have-you
you can buy a used one for around MSRP
in the States or slightly under that
whatever that equivalent dollar amount
is and Canadian dollars then yeah I
would say go for it I don't have
anything really to complain about with
klax card other than the fact that some
of them are marked up a bit higher than
they should be and that the white card
at least in the 1070 TI's case is not
actually white I mean that was me just
kind of nitpicking but to be honest if
you buy a white card you should expect a
white card let's see here
in Seoul says I have a 1080 Ti for the
win three what are your thoughts on
selling up you can try it be my guest
I can't guarantee it'll work but you can
try it certainly
okay here Anthony matera do you
experience your CPU power usage reported
reporting incorrectly in hardware info
showing a max of eleven point three
watts I know that isn't right
okay so eleven point three watts yeah
that's weird yeah it's I wouldn't use
software monitoring for power
consumption is usually inaccurate to
some extent I don't like to do this
stuff at all I use clamp meters guys so
if you get if you get a clamp meter or
an an meter that that will clamp around
cables they're usually I think for an
EPS I'm pretty sure for for an EPS cable
it's an eight pin CPU cable the they're
the four pins that are closest to the
clip on the a pin EPS are the ones that
drop out and now if you put your clamp
around all eight cables you're gonna get
a lower reading than you would otherwise
because you have some of that power
returning right through ground so if you
just clamp the cables that are supplying
power and as in one way right one
direction then you're gonna be able to
read directly what that a pin EPS is
pulling from the power supply and that's
from the wall so that's that's to me a
much more accurate way of doing it I
wouldn't trust software at all that
8,500 K should be putting I don't I
don't even I don't know for sure but it
should be at least a hundred watts if
not higher than that under load anyway
if you're idling you know it might be 30
watts and I something you know it'll be
a lot lower than it would be under load
obviously so I would suggest an ammeter
like a clamp meter and then you could
really gauge your power consumption if
you're really worried about that it's
good to have anyway let's see here
worried B says your videos helped me
build my first PC so thanks I appreciate
that it's why this channel exists
I like building my PC's and I was I was
younger and I I started the channel
around that that premise well I didn't
start the channel original around the
premise but it morphed into that premise
because I was excited to build my PC for
the channel and you you guys really
amped up about that so that's what this
channel eventually became I kind of
morphed into a tech channel because
is the demand was there so you know I I
have fun with it either way so doesn't
doesn't hurt me
Stevens Santilli Santilli that's a cool
name as an Italian and Greg I have a
three hundred and fifty dollars to spend
on a CPU for gaming and a bit of
streaming okay Rison or Intel board
doesn't matter since I need a new one
anyway have other money
three hundred fifty bucks is spent on a
CPU for gaming and a bit of streaming if
you're gonna do mostly gaming the 8700 K
is still King
you still getting six scores still ideal
you'll experience a tiny FPS drop
between that and something like a 2700 X
but if you got 350 bucks to spend and
you primarily game I would say the 87
case still the better bet if you do a
little stream you can still tweak things
you know I know some of the other guys I
don't know gamers Nexus for example was
showing how horizon and does a better
job at allocating the stream preference
right for the viewer versus the
framerate and yeah that's something to
keep in mind you can of course tweak
that stuff though it's gonna remember
like what he was showing it was just
kind of like as is right but you can do
a lot of things to tweak it to
reallocate resources toward one or the
other
so it doesn't mean that Intel under
every circumstance is gonna be the worst
streamer although having the extra cores
on board is definitely optimal if u
stream 50% of the time go Rison if you
stream only 10% of the time go with
intel that's that's my rule of thumb
there oh okay yeah our J game sorry
missed at $2 donation might do through
the super chat what is worth upgrading
from a GTX 480 from a GTX 480 RJ it
really depends on what kind of money
you're willing to spend right now I'm
saying ten seventy TI ish the only
reason I'm saying that's because I think
that there's a surplus of 1070 Ti is in
the market right now which is why those
are the only cards I'm basically getting
to review right now so ten seven et eyes
are gonna cost around 500 bucks it's
still a little higher than they should
be in my opinion that the prices haven't
completely leveled out but it's it's not
bad for what it is so it's it's really
not bad
mm somebody I saw you did ya been baby
yeah and I was talking about amp clamps
yeah so you want to make sure the
around the knot ground but around the
positive or negative either one you want
to make sure you group only one of those
what do you think okay Alijah Stricker
what do you think snagged on our seven
seventy hundred four to 20 micro cent
are gonna pair it with us ten seventy 16
gigs of ram when x three seventy plus on
a Sunday night right now I'm cleaning my
baby's bottles for tomorrow my dude
that's a pretty good deal there you got
a micro Center to 24-hour seven 1700
what a steel that's around our five
price you're getting an extra two cores
and four threads I'll get it will
slightly lower TDP by don't expect to
have issues overclocking or hitting 3.9
gigahertz for example and actually
seventy board that's not bad at all now
to heck of a deal micro Center is the
way to go if you live close bob flanders
ICU what's up Bob good to see you again
hungry how are you doing Oh Paul as well
thanks for the great videos thanks for
tuning into this live stream Bob
Flanders I appreciate it I love seeing
you guys in the comments the ones that I
keep seeing over and over II know you
guys are always you're just dedicated
fans and I appreciate that you know even
if you're not a fan of every video we
release the fact that you're willing to
watch the videos we upload and give them
a chance that's really cool so I really
appreciate that man dose GTI all day I
love your channel very informative quick
question can you update the bios of
first gen rising motherboard without
using first gen CPU this kind of ties
into something I talked about mandos I
invite you to go watch my risin second
gen video where I pop the second gen CPU
into a be 350 motherboard I talked about
it there I'm pretty sure you can still
contact a and B they'll send you like a
really low power like dud almost CPU you
put that in your system you flash the
BIOS and then you can put your new CPU
in there but otherwise it would require
write rise in one CPUs Raven Ridge not
Raven Ridge summit ridge CPUs in those
first gen rising boards in order to
update the BIOS because you have to have
a CPU in your motherboard update the
BIOS unless you're doing something weird
like cue flash or I'm not sure if that
works with AMD I'm not familiar with
that to the extent that I should be
probably but I know in a few instances
with some gigabyte boards and
what-have-you you can update your BIOS
without a CPU in it but that's a very
like
special thing and not all boards can do
that so just make sure you're doing your
research but it's good that you know at
least that you will need a CPU that
that's in that case yeah you want to
check with AMD double-check to see if
they'll send you something that's kind
of you know just a dud no they'll let
you update your bus that way okay
Roberto says liking the stream because I
don't hate everything about life you
know what that's awesome I appreciate
that it's okay it's okay for people to
have differences of opinions it's okay
if you don't like everything about life
to dislike the video it's not a problem
okay I'm not gonna hold that against you
honestly the like and dislike ratio is
really only matter to me when they're
like 50/50 you know if it was like half
as many or if they're an equal number of
dislikes as there are likes obviously
there's like a huge problem with that
video or people were just really
hell-bent on like stirring up
controversy or something you know if you
like to dislike Rachel's around 80% 90%
I'll either call it a controversial
video or a successful video probably
both just because it's a little out of
the ordinary we have Mike Bartok Mike
Bartok I think I said that right I
scroll back up here completely lost your
mic where'd you go there you are hey I'm
a fan for a long time now I know you
were trying to battle the to battle the
moment subscribers what you were doing
giveaway and you said you would reveal
the winners but you never did giveaways
when you said you would not sure what
you're talking about Mike I've never
done a giveaway and not announced the
winners
I always announce the winners within a
week usually if a big if I ever did a
month but point of the giveaway you're
talking about I haven't done something
like that in a while uh hey Greg bland
Paloma I want to know your preference on
this mechanical or membrane did I use
membrane for the longest time I thought
mechanicals were so annoying when I
first used them but now I can't go back
membranes feel like squishing jello just
depends on what you're used to we've
been doing more grant goofs I currently
have an FX 4350 in an Rx 460 what would
you recommend me to do I have money
around 800 USD
so assuming you don't need a graphics
card upgrade I'll assume you already got
that in the bag
800 bucks to get you
pretty much anything consumer-grade
right now so you could go
top-of-the-line Intel with an i7 8700 K
go top-of-the-line Rison with a 2700 X
and annoy you know an X 470 motherboard
and 16 gigs of ram cuz you're gonna need
new Ram by the way if you get a new
platform because FX the FX platform
bulldozer pile driver was on ddr3 if you
recall so you're any new Ram let's say
you get 16 gigs at 200 bucks you get an
X 470 motherboard for 200 bucks it's
$400 right there and then you spend
another 300 350 bucks on a 2700 X that's
what like 750 800 bucks there's your
budget that's what I would do especially
want to stick with Intel hmm Blake Vogel
what are your predictions on future GP
prices think they're gonna come down I
don't want to get more involved in max
I'm not a fortune-teller I don't follow
the market that closely but the BA let's
see he uh Bryan Sivak Savickas says I
lost my comment this is like the matrix
Liam says hey my PC stopped posting all
of a sudden my mother my motherboard
debug light says it doesn't detect the
GPU okay but I've invested it but I've
tested and it's fine hmm I've got a
rising build any thoughts well then it
sounds like if it's not your graphics
card cuz you've tested it another system
then it's your motherboard it might be
the PCIe slot maybe you can try it the
the 16x slot the fools the you know the
full length slot underneath that one see
if you get a post from there it won't
run on the full 16 lanes I presume but
you know you still get a post just get a
C by the way a posting posting is
different than so if you're not getting
picture your system still my post right
but you don't you don't know that it's
posting because you're not getting an
image to your screen so you need to
double check with that try a different
graphics card in the motherboard other
than the one that you have just narrow
down the odds that it's some kind of
weird incompatibility between the car
and the motherboard again try different
slot and let's see I don't know if you
have you got a rise and build so you
probably don't have an APU so you're
gonna have to use a graphics card
to see a post so yeah do those two
things and let me know what you get if
you've already done those things let me
know okay I see colossal cubes what cpu
specs do you need on second PC dedicated
to 4k streaming if you're only gonna do
4k streaming on that may 4k streaming is
really tough to begin with I'm assuming
you got the bandwidth the handle it but
you gotta have some mad upload speeds I
assume you have like gigabit internet or
something like that so let's see let's
say you have that and let's say that you
have one PC for gaming and you're using
the second one for streaming and
encoding 4k is gonna be regardless of if
it's dedicated or not it's still gonna
be huge
it's gonna be a huge tax on your CP
right because of the encoding process so
I don't know I don't know enough about
that to give you a confident answer I
don't a something that's incorrect I
would just search forms on that one
because I've never tried to fork a
stream I just don't see the feasibility
in that so I'm probably not the person
asked for that because I've never done
that before
1080p streaming you can do that with an
i-5 you know or like if it's a dedicated
streaming machine then all it's doing is
streaming right so you probably just
want to have something that's at least
got four cores that are probably higher
clocked or maybe like a risin 5 CPU but
if you want to use integrated graphics
and not a graphics card then you
probably would stick with Intel so it
depends but you got a lot of different
options away there ok I'm scrolling up
here I want to see you a missed any
experience with thermal thermal right
CPU coolers thermal right thermal right
let me see here thermal right I've never
heard of thermal right and they and ok
so he's saying that they're cheap AF on
Amazon right now let me see here I've
never actually used these coolers so and
they'd never contacted me to review any
of
so I will have to wait to to give you my
verdict on those I just don't know yet
is a strict this is from Maxim two to
five is a an RN I in 390 acts still good
for gaming in 2018
or should I think about upgrading soon
if show if so should I get a gtx 1070
not looking to break the bank yeah I
mean I think you kind of know the answer
to your own question right like the aura
and 390x
is gonna do as well as its gonna do
given what your preferences are if you
want to play in 1440p medium ish
settings right you know the r9 390x is
gonna handle that but the the issue with
the 390 X's that runs are really really
hot so if you if you're tired of how
loud it gets how hot it runs how hot it
makes the other components in your
system when it's under load then get a
1070 it's gonna consume much less power
it'll usually run quieter and cooler so
1070 is a good upgrade definitely yeah
if you can get decent amount of money
for your r9 390 because right now 390
X's I'm pretty sure is still in hot
demand for the miners so we're trying to
pick it up last minute you might be able
to get a lot of your money back for that
okay let's see how chase zimin what's
the best GPU for 1440p at high FPS at
Ultra settings okay chase so the FPS
isn't gonna really matter as much for
graphics cards the frame rate is all
about how the GPU calls frames from the
CPU and the CPU is gonna be your
limiting factor there when it comes to
frame rate so if you just want to 1440p
ultra settings you probably get away
with a 1070 or 1080 with that it's hard
to recommend the vega 56 or vega 64
which would be the equivalent AMD cards
you could handle those those in game
settings and that resolution but for the
most part you can be better off with
Nvidia because our gonna be cheaper and
they will consume less power
and generally be quieter because we have
plenty of a IDs to choose from so 1070
to 1080 would be perfectly fine in 1440p
min up maybe not the ultra ultra preset
but you'll be up there just in my
experience
scrolling down here okay I always get
asked this will you be doing a
hackintosh build soon I don't really
know what what is it with you guys in
the hackintosh but is it just like a
cure like you're just like super curious
or some because I know you've seen those
hackintosh builds on other channels but
like do you just want to see me like
struggle to install it or sir what like
what's going on with that because I get
asked that every stream
I'm just curious I would do it if enough
people were interested I would have to
have like a petition with like a
thousand sign signatures before I'd ever
get the balls to want to install like
Mac OS on a frickin desktop so and apart
from that there's always those freaking
kids who are like oh I can't touch it's
illegal it's illegal
alright anyway
scrolling up here to hold it Jay Gregg
what is your favorite guitar brand and
can I get your thoughts on my current
main guitar Thank You Holden for that $4
$0.99 donation my dude I will gladly
answer these questions good questions so
favorite guitar brand Gibson for sure
even though they just went bankrupt I
have two gifts and Les Paul customs I
have a Gibson SG those are the three
Gibson's I have and you only have the
only other one that I want I want like a
Fender Telecaster because I love the way
those sound cuz I have a Stratocaster
but stratocasters are more like they're
just they're a little more treble either
they're higher pitched and then the
strings just feel different on a Fender
fretboard and then I lied also like an
Ibanez because Breaking Benjamin and I
haven't as go really well together
Breaking Benjamin favourite band so yeah
that's my other dream guitar but Les
Paul customs I mean like those things
more cheap I won't lie my parents bought
those for me it was way back in the day
they were just like they bought them and
it was like their motivation to get me
to keep playing guitar and I'm sure my
dad's just gonna sit on those and wait
to sell them at some point for $7,000
piece or whatever especially now that
the company's going bankrupt I'm not
sure there was a chapter 11 like are
they are they still gonna be around or
they just dissolving everything I'm not
sure about that a good question and then
also for your other question their
thoughts on your current main guitar you
have an I don't even see you
thus easier you have an ibanez let me
Google that exact model because I am not
as familiar with Ibanez I said I used
from here than Gibson's let's see here
Oh looking good it's one of those semi
hollow body guitar I bet that thing
sounds dope my dude and it's not too
expensive either what - 300 bucks what
kind of pickup she got on those they're
just generic or I'm curious see I've
only used humbuckers like humbuckers
some of the best sounding pickups out
there so it would be hard for me to drop
down especially even down to like a I
don't know some of the fenders out there
just the sound isn't quite there for me
not when you come from something that
that good frankly I see you Bath's cute
that has a hey say when you have three
SS baths q3 don't need that $2 could a
super chat he says what's a what's food
you've never gotten sick of a food I've
never gotten sick of dang these
questions are loaded people a food I've
never gotten sick of would probably have
to be mmm would probably have to be
goldfish yeah I think goldfish I could
never truly get sick of if it was just
me on an island stranded and I had a
choice between water and goldfish I
would choose goldfish because I would
rather go out that way then die just
from hunger so no and I don't want to
eat bark and like sand that sounds
terrible okay
JP stone my dude another $20 did a super
chat JP appreciate your support
appreciate the channel thank you for
that thanks for sharing expertise
experience life and time with all of us
peace and love from Southern California
all right I would I have a secret
admiration for Southern Cal I know it's
like you know there's a lot of stuff
that gives Southern Cal bad rap but I
think it's still beautiful we guys have
beautiful weather beautiful buildings
and he's never really nice atmosphere
over there I've been there a couple
times my dad's family's from over there
and I would I wouldn't mind living over
there
really I really wouldn't certain parts
of the place I wouldn't want to live
that Southern Cal in general right you
get that like Hollywood feel San Diego
Los Angeles idea that that would be a
nice place to live for sure um so I
appreciate you sending that and for
supporting us and I'm glad that you
stuck around I will do my best to to
share whatever expertise I might have
I'm still learning every day guys let
you know that that's why I say thanks
for learning with it cuz I'm still
learning everything a lot of you
probably know more than I do about this
to be frank I just enjoy learning if I'm
wrong I want to know why I'm wrong I
want to know how it actually works so I
can better explain it to my audience
and that's really illnesses this is just
a try just is just a you know a give and
take of knowledge is all anything is in
the academic world so I love teaching I
love learning that's why this channel
exists mister lil Nick for that $2 super
chat I love the channel man what ddr4
Ram for my 2700 X good question so I can
tell you right now g.skill paired a
bunch of us with that a camouflaged
looking I don't know if it was sniper
rim I'm not sure
speaking of sniper Ram we just talked
about the graphics cards but it's like
the camouflage on top I could sure what
Ram model that is but they shipped all
that with with AMD second gen stuff so
I'm pretty sure that stuff's gonna be
pretty well been the thing is though
horizon to horizon second gen excuse me
is much more tolerable when it comes to
XMP profiles and whatnot with the rise
someone I could never enable XMP profile
just wouldn't happen rise into is much
better suited for that I would say any
kit like I've used Triton's a ddr4 I've
used Corsair Dom plats I've used like
some cheaper g.skill stuff I've used
team group stuff XMP profile on all that
with rise in - no problem so it's almost
gonna come down to timings at that point
you can get that extra kick out of the
Infinity fabric right which is tied to
memory frequency and timing so you know
anything that is that says it's rising
compatible it's probably gonna be just
fine for this and even if it's not with
the rise in second gen you're gonna
you're gonna have a much better time
tweaking your timings and frequencies
with rise in second gen than you will
with rise some 1st gen nori Rivera for
that $5 super chest so I guess I'm
trying to get through this the super jet
real quick so I don't forget these I
don't want to do what I did last time
and miss out on a couple of super chats
love the channel man what did you have
for RAM for my tone oh sorry wrong one
Shh
Nuria vera hi Greg three rivers barbecue
much oh okay okay three rivers barbecue
um give me a second give me a second
I'm kind of scared here because I feel
like I think I should know this where am
i where am i right now
Orlando through rivers barbecue you know
I've never eaten in Three Rivers
barbecue so I'm actually a little
unfamiliar with that I feel like I
should know this I feel I feel a little
left out now because I'm expected to
know this right I like barbecue I'll
tell you that that's about but all I can
say though cuz I don't know exactly what
uh what else you meant by that but
anyway I'm sure it's great and he also
references the GN mod mat yeah I
actually have one of those Steve sent me
one really cool him to do that cuz I
know those things aren't cheap and they
went through a lot of work to get those
things manufactured so awesome for you
know and he gets a little gets a little
kick out of it too right to get to show
off G in on other you know channels so
it's it's kind of a win-win but he was
really cool to do in the first place to
even consider sending one to the channel
and the mat is actually really well made
I was telling that it's it's nice and
it's firm it's rough enough to be like
stuff doesn't slide easily you know it's
not like a mousepad per se it's actually
a rougher surface than that he was
talking about how like if you drop stuff
they don't bounce very high because it's
just got a really like packed in you
know like spring inhibition almost just
by the way it's manufactured so it's a
really good mod mat I recommend you get
it I really do just another youtuber
phat $2 super chat my dude have you ever
considered a guitar stream you know I
I'm not sure I might just like pull up
because I just have it like a little
coos to hear a little baby Taylor I'll
just pull it out one day and probably
just jam it on a little bit you know I'm
not like a super rock star anything like
that I can play decent but I know plenty
of plenty of people who are better than
I am so it's not something I
particularly want to show off I don't
know maybe I'll try it one day and you
see what you guys think leave in
castelló Castillo leave on leavin
Castillo I'm gonna say like that I must
or Spanish I'm not sure donated five
dollars through super chat my do
appreciate that please help one sec Fram
lat one second frame lag when new ting
and Pub G and rust when shadow plays on
that's interesting not sure why you have
an issue there may and might have
something to do with your three gig
buffer on your 1060 just a just a shot
in the dark
again I don't know for sure but you
might want to check that out check your
buffer see if you're not maxed out and
then you could check a few other things
too while you're at it through MSI
Afterburner just check to make sure
you're not getting maxed out
utilizations anywhere you might drop
some settings especially in the
graphical side okay and then one more
nan na n think for that to new zealand
not a super chat have you ever heard a
water cooling brand name to borrow I
have not
I will definitely research them though
interesting honestly like I just know
that you know the big three or four like
pretty much chill ek alpha cool a couple
of smaller ones that manufacture really
cool stuff that I don't exactly have
contacts with at this point but I would
love to use in the future thermaltake is
another one that I use a lot of just
because they're more value oriented so
yeah those are the big four that I
usually look at I'm not too familiar
with the smaller ones but I would be
more than happy to review their hardware
for sure
primo are I not pretty much go fantex by
the way makes some pretty cool water
cooling stuff Oh many people know that I
make cool graphics card blocks I mean
cool CPU blocks even reservoirs now so
something else to check out wiseguy says
one day he will see this comment and he
will help me get my couch sold well I
hope your couch stalls now dude there
you go Baba hmm crackling I says hey
Greg does chicken taste like everything
or does everything taste like chicken
that is a serious and loaded question
you guys are on it today with those
loaded questions I do not know a lot of
stuff tastes like chicken I think
because chicken is just no I don't even
know why why does stuff taste like
chicken or why why does chicken taste
like other stuff chicken chicken has a
very like mediocre flavor by itself I
it's part of the reason why because it
doesn't have like a very like gamey
natural taste and more or less taste
like whatever you put on it ie gravy or
seasonings or what-have-you I think
that's why people say chicken tastes
like a lot of things because it's kind
of like just like a an empty profile
that you want to just subconsciously
fill with something else that you've
tasted that's also a pretty bland I
don't know but chicken is just one of
those things you can pretty much put in
anything and it'll taste like chicken or
chicken I'll taste like whatever you put
it in lucidity that's a cool name hey
should I buy a GTX 1080i now or wait
until the next GTX series comes out I
don't know I'm not you I don't know if
you need it right now or if you need to
wait you know if you need it six months
from now if you really need a card right
now buy one now but I can't answer that
question for you cuz I don't know how
bad you need the card you need the card
right now buy it but if you're willing
to wait I think it'll be worth the wait
I will say that I think it'll be worth
the wait I don't think anybody's gonna
try to price gouges hopefully that
doesn't happen
I expect around the same price per tear
so whatever the next no thing is after
1070 right and 1170 or whatever they do
with the naming scheme I think that'll
still be priced around what the MSRP was
originally from the 1070 launched so you
know if Nvidia is gonna be a good guy
here which we'll see and we saw what
happened with GPP then we we might have
a chance
add some I mean if you think about it
you know NVIDIA hasn't really had a lot
of competition in the graphics card
space they had the rx 480 and the 580 in
the 560 in the you know 550 whatever you
know they had the lower end stuff but
they never really had much competition
on the upper end right but the 1070 and
up
so the 1070 the 1080 the 1080 Ti the
Titan the Titan XP the Titan Pascal and
all the different titans that were named
very stupidly so despite that fact right
despite the fact that NVIDIA has not had
supreme competition up there because
Megan 56 and 64 were flops in the sense
that you couldn't really buy those cards
and then they immediately shot up
because mining they didn't price them as
aggressively as they probably could have
if you think about it they probably
could have asked a hundred bucks more
for a 1070 and people probably would
have bought it because if you think
about what the 1080 is and the 1070 is
the 1070 is like a 90 DTI
the 90 BT I launched it six hundred and
seven dollars the 1070 which is
an equivalently you know powerful card
but that consumes less power is
therefore you know just a cooler card is
only priced at 400 bucks or 420 whatever
they said that it was and before mining
messed everything up the 1070 was a
great value at 400 bucks so Nvidia
actually did a solid there they really
did they brought us the equivalent
performance for a much lower price and
with much more efficiency in mind and
and that's something that I don't want
you guys to take lightly you know I was
I was harping on Vidya in that GPP video
I really was just cuz I think it was a
stupid relapse that shouldn't have even
happened in the first place but NVIDIA
has not wronged the consumer to any
significant amount since I would say the
970 3.5 gig thing which was just that
was another stupid thing that should
have happened who ever let that pass
should have been fired I don't even know
what happened with that I didn't follow
story too much I just knew it was like a
it was an issue you know how much slower
that half a gig Aram was our memory was
so the value proposition with Nvidia is
still there especially for the upper two
your cards me about 10 60 but for the
upper stuff and if we expect the same
amount of power right equivalently for
the same price category then 1170 Ti or
whatever they call it the next step it
from the 1070 in the next-gen is gonna
be a heck of a car and a heck of a value
so just food for thought you guys ya
crackling ice I remember the days when
$300 was the most expensive GP you could
buy I think part of that has to do with
inflation probably has to do with
production costs I mean you know I'm
sure you know that but like you know
prices are always gonna go up as long as
the value if money continues to fall and
that has been the trend for the past 20
or so years so ever since the u.s. went
off the gold standard
you know when US currency became fiat
currency our currencies just been really
screwed as as most currencies in the
world let's see I am scrolling sorry
about that ramp by the way I hope you
guys at least see where I'm coming from
there I see noggin $3 donation my dude
would you recommend a rise in APU
eventually with dedicated GPU yeah we
got that kind of cohesive combination
right between if
yet for example AMD Vega CPUs ap use
essentially right with the 8 or 11 or
whatever Vega cores we have in those
paired with a dedicated graphics card
that was also based on Vega and that we
could communicate with those via
crossfire like we could with the
previous stuff back in like 2013-14 then
that would be a pretty sweet idea
although I'm not sure how efficient it
would end up being because when you have
crossfire SLI running you're only really
extracting up to maybe 50 60 percent of
that second cards potential so and then
there's the argument that well what if
you had that that CPU run physics right
or something along those lines well that
they already kind of do that if you go
into your control panels but then video
cards for example you either have the
card handling physics properties but
physics is not even that big a deal
anymore used to be a bigger deal or you
could you could just designate the CPUs
integrator graphics processor as like
that physics processor you're not gonna
know as much of a difference because
that's not the limiting factor in most
cases so the combination is gonna be
interesting for sure I would love to
test it but at the same time I don't
think it's gonna be as viable as people
think it'll be because I mean if it's
anything like the last gen stuff right
with the AP use there and we care that
like an ro 9 to 70 or whatever it still
wasn't anything to like
JA you know drop your draw about so
that's just my take on it
let's see arbitrary Alex I did read that
he says hey Greg you probably won't read
this but I love your videos keep it up
and see I read y'all's chat I really do
liam some more thinking for that $2
Canadian super chat I tried both your
suggestions and no post well then it
sounds like you got a bad board my dude
if you're not getting any video to your
motherboard and any slot you put it in
and maybe just check power delivery be
other things I can think of your
motherboards probably fried that card
works in a different board and it's
probably your board which sucks but
that's what I would roll it at just off
the top of my head don't take it you
know straight up make sure you do due
diligence but that's what it sounds like
at least
dr. x17 what do you think of the idea of
Intel making their own graphics cards I
think the more competition the better
I'm perfectly fine with as long as they
don't try to you know stifle the market
and corner it and and you know screw
over the consumer which I don't think
they could do I'm fine with it there's
nothing wrong with having more options
out there I've never been upset about
I've never looked at my screen and be
like oh why are there so many cards to
choose from you know you might think you
might say that just because you don't
want to do the work hunting for the
right one but just black and white it's
a good thing to have choice it really is
there are many countries out there that
only have one option and I'm sure many
people live in those countries will come
back and tell you that those prices are
not pretty for many reasons but partly
because there is no other competition
around all right it's the it's the good
and the bad of capitalism you guys know
how that works gun dem Mugen gun damn
again I don't know how I said anyway
thanks for that $2 supa Chet is a risin
1600 and gigabyte a V through the DM for
219 used I don't know what you're asking
you mean is it use like is it is it a
good deal yeah that's a good deal
1600 usually running about 180 hundred
ninety bucks gigabyte a B 350 M it's a
cheaper board to mom it's a it's a m ATX
board so it you have to you know it
might not look the greatest in a
full-size tower or a mid tower but 219
used it's okay
talk them down to 200 so you can get it
for 200 bucks that's still not a bad
bargain Paulson George ash K
congratulations you get a 450 with a
1080 I'm confused I think I read that
out of context anyway scrolling down
here which graphics card is best for the
i3 540 out that's a that's gonna be
tough 750ti max that's what I'm gonna
say they're just off the top of my head
again don't take these as like exact
recommendations I'm just kind of
eyeballing some of these I'm trying to
move through as many as I can okay Bob
tart 12 what's up man what's going on
dude Beastmaster 101 thoughts on when
and how good the RX 600 series will be
no idea guys I have no clue
don't know anything about it I don't
follow that kind of like you know Ruhr
stuff I usually just wait until I get
the press releases I see the stats that
they post on screen I develop my
preconceived notions and then I
challenge those notions when I actually
get my hands on the cards that's
basically how am i testing my testing
goes Nicholas Lopes why is a TX still
the standard a Vidya has killed off
3-way SLI so there's not really a used
so there's not really a use to having
that many PCI slots anymore anyway why
isn't the marking why isn't the market
shifting that micro-atx which is a
question that's actually pretty valid I
think that things are pretty much you
know it's almost like going to a buffet
right not to say that full ATX
motherboards are wasteful but having
more options is better
certainly and when you have let's say
you have two cards in SLI well the micro
ATX board usually those two slots are
spaced out enough right where you can't
fit anything else there so let's say you
have SLI and you want to put a Wi-Fi
card in there or maybe a capture card
I'm pretty sure unless you choke one of
the cards air flows you're not gonna
have that ability to put three things in
three slots so apart from that you also
have issues with PCI aliens and whatnot
usually your chips that will handle four
of them but it's something else to
consider you just want to have more
options if you can cases and and all
these layouts all these templates these
these companies that actually design and
manufacture the boards have these
layouts and they've been using them for
a long time the specs are pretty
mainstream at this point it's gonna be
hard to kind of shift the norm so just
just something I'm thinking of you know
it's just I don't know most micro ATX
boards have built-in Wi-Fi though not
true not true I would say maybe half of
them do now you're probably looking at
the more expensive M ATX boards but a
lot of em ATX boards are AM ATX boards
because they're cheap and because it
doesn't require as much
it doesn't require it usually as many
resources to build an ATX board so when
you get down to iti it's different story
because you're cramming a ton of stuff
on a very small slab PCB so that the
technical aspect there is certainly
greater that's why ITX motherboard Zoar
generally around the same price it met a
little more expensive than their ATX
counterparts really depends on the
boards you're comparing but in most
cases I would say the EM ATX it's just
gonna be like I wouldn't argue I
wouldn't basically I'm saying is your
argument that Wi-Fi is on most em a
micro ATX boards and therefore that's
okay to have less slots isn't valid to
me because that's not the only case
scenario obviously not all the m8
exports have Wi-Fi and obviously that's
not the only thing you could slot into
that extra slot if you're running a
seller crossfire so I just think it
limits people if it became mainstream
you would have people complaining all
the time about how they don't have
access to those extra slots
that's just without getting too far into
this what I think right
see here Andrew a lot how much should I
sell a computer for with an FX 6300
that's like 20 bucks max a GTX 560 560
jeez 50 bucks max maybe 50 60 bucks so
that were at like $80 maybe it might be
which probably has less than that eight
gigs of ram a hundred 110 bucks 600
power supply it's used 120 hundred 30
bucks maybe and then let's see 3 320
gigabyte hardest drive 10 bucks
like another tent so 130 windows 10 you
get Windows 10 for 10 20 30 bucks I
would say I don't think 300 spare at all
I think you're asking probably twice as
much that you should honestly I honestly
wouldn't pay 300 bucks for this system I
would pay probably half that do be
completely honest with you I do like
your storage is so low and it's a hard
drive so it's super slow I assume I'm
just going off top my head it probably
is a little louder than modern or
drives eight gigs of ram is a bottleneck
no matter how you look at it it's an old
platform so it's locked in that sense as
well 6100 isn't even a 6300 so it's pre
pile drive it's bulldozer I think which
had issues it's a 562 gig card which is
also limited I think that system is very
limited all around I probably wouldn't
pay more than I probably wouldn't a more
than 50 bucks for it just straight up I
don't mean to insult you that's just
what I see value wise in that bill
sarathkumar Roy Choi hurry I don't know
what currency that is but thank you for
that hundred of whatever currency that
is thank you for donation how much
should I pay for a 4 to 5 month old R X
480 where can I find compatible Ram list
for risin 2700 X look risin 27 X is
compatible with any Ram it's compatible
with any ddr4 out there but if you're
asking for overclocked ability and like
how you know how tight you can get those
timings and stuff it's gonna depend
really if it says it's am do you rise
incompatible it's probably gonna give
you some flexibility risin to rest and
second gen is much more tolerable when
it comes to RAM timing these frequency I
can enable XMP profile and rise in
second gen it couldn't do that I'm
rising 1st gen so just food for thought
there 32 case of memories perfectly fine
are X 480 if it's 4 to 5 months old see
if it was mined with it was mine with
you should probably ask a little less
than what he's asking for if you're
comfortable haggling you know buying a
mining card isn't a problem unless you
see or hear a problem with the card at
which point you probably want to stay
away from it altogether but if it runs
fine
sounds fine there's not like an obscene
coil wine or whatever temps look to be
in check it's probably an okay car to
buy just don't pay exactly what they're
asking for unless it's a really good
deal already
you know haggle with him see if you can
get 20 30 bucks less for it you know or
see if you can pay 20 30 bucks less for
it
gun dem Mugen $2 donation again the
board was a motherboard was MIT X okay
gotcha Gary wait let's see I am
scrolling down here okay Christopher
Barrett hey Greg how how life is going
I'm planning to build my new computer
and
I don't know we twist I don't know which
CPU motherboard to choose my thoughts
are the i-5 8400 and B 360 ok or the r5
2400 G and B 350 just for gaming just
for gaming ok if you're just gaming the
i5 8400 is probably fine you're gonna
get a higher framerate then you will put
that r5 2400 G in almost every scenario
and depending on what graphic card you
pair with you next game in 1080p 1440p
not too it's not going to be a huge
limiting factor so I would say the i5
you're just gonna game that that's just
my take on it ok scrolling down here
scrolling down here we have galaxy tiger
should I get a risin 3 1200 now and wait
a year or two for an upgrade I am
currently on an FX 6300 if you're on a
really tight budget that's a tough call
I mean if you're content with what you
already have wait say about more money
then get yourself an even nicer system
because if the Rison 3 1200 you're still
limiting yourself the FX 6300 is a
limiting CPU right now but the Rison 3
1200 is a limiting CPU as well so you're
almost side grading maybe not from a
performance standpoint but just from an
upgradability standpoint you might be
able to just swap the CPU out later but
then there might be an even better
platform out there so if all you can do
is get a rise in 3 CP right now from a
6300 I would just chill for a while
let's say about more money if you can
and buy something even nicer than that
that's what I would sets what I would
say okay I wanna see I saw one up here
look really good okay yeah Bryan Sivak
uh says careful overclocking RAM
especially messing with timings I didn't
learn my lesson when I had to reinstall
windows due to corrupt windows files
yeah so overclocking Ram is different
than clocking Ram to what it's SPECT to
be right so if out of the box
frequencies are 3200 megahertz and your
timings are 16 16 18 32 whatever then
you can enable X and B profile it'll
default to those values right but if you
go any higher than that yeah you're
gonna have issues
I don't ever overclock
I never do because like you just said
Brian it's a pain in the ass to
overclock Ram and have a stable system
and even a troubleshoot if it's even a
stable system because your RAM might
corrupt something in the middle of a
game or in the middle of rendering or
creating footage or you know doing
anything like that Ram I usually don't
touch and able like to be profile with
rice and ii Jenner and tell CPUs and
just call it a day that's what I do
I wouldn't recommend overclocking I
really wouldn't but Kay let's see here
okay okay okay you guys are awesome yep
325 people watching mine we isn't doing
on Sunday night I'll do it I see we have
a oh I see you guys okay all right
what do I do to start a tech channel is
it too late South Lawn 360 probably too
late you might be able to have find an
ish in your area though especially if
you if you speak a different language
you probably present the tech in your
language and you might have an edge I'd
say in the English market tech channels
are everywhere now like they're
everywhere I think science studio
started around the same around the time
that probably would have been the latest
to start one and to be able to grow
substantially within a smaller time
frame if you want to start a tech
channel now you gotta do something
really cool you've got to be really out
there and really be on your game to get
any substantial audience within a year
that's just because so many people out
there are watching so many different
Tech's
getting your face to match up with
someone's preferences in the sub box is
gonna be really tough it's tough for us
now because there are so many especially
smaller tech channels that are trying to
take off and you know when you have a
diluted market like that things tend to
spread out do you tend to spread out and
that's that's tough to fight there
really is okay towstee productions
what's going on another $5 super chat I
appreciate that I wish you'd asked a
question though I feel like I'm just
taking your money and running with it I
invite you guys please to ask questions
especially if you're willing to donate
cuz heck you know I don't I don't want
to just take your money if that actually
feeling like I did something before I
know the answering a question isn't
worth what you're
but I appreciate you guys doing this for
me and for sticking around 336 people
watching what are you guys doing on a
Sunday night I love you guys coalition
gave me anything for that $3 50 cent
soup watch at I hope you like my crash
bandicoot animations by the way whenever
somebody subscribes or whenever somebody
donates via the super chat you see the
crash animation and I absolutely love
crash bandicoot coalition gaming says yo
would be cool to see some Zeon build
rock on I actually I have a few older
Zeon builds I haven't touched a Zeon
lately and I probably should I just
think that prices are so good right now
on the consumer side that it's difficult
to recommend a Xeon processor unless
it's a really huge like old processor so
I might do something old like that I
think i'ma have to hit up a ryan from
tech yesterday on this one because the
guy he can find deals anywhere I'm
probably gonna have to get his expertise
when it comes to Xeon builds maybe we'll
do some kind of cool collab or something
when we're in Taipei see if we can build
a CPU on the used market in Taiwan that
would be pretty sweet just to kind of do
a collab with a channel for once
face-to-face that would be pretty
awesome okay sarov another 100 whatever
currency that is I appreciate it thanks
for the suggestion of memory I was
having sleepless nights over its Indian
rupees that's what it is Indian rupees
thank you for that I don't know what
that equals in US dollars but I
appreciate it anyway and thanks for
asking your question I'm glad that you
can sleep a little better now knowing
that memory is not as big a
compatibility issue with rising 2nd gen
as was the first gen so I think you're
perfectly fine there fee over the 2700 X
okay yeah
the beasts or it says egg Greg looking
to build PC but not sure by the parts
due to the high prices yeah totally
understand that should I wait to buy the
parts look it's as one of those things
again should I wait or should I buy now
I can't answer the question for you I
don't know if you need the PC right now
if you need something desperately right
now and you're not too worried about
computational power you just need
something right now to type documents
and send stuff and kind of surf the web
online you want it like a desktop then
you could just buy something really
cheap used you could build a use PC on
the cheap and you get better value for
that for your money and and then you can
kind of hang on a little bit until
prices on the new stuff right with RAM
memory
graphics cards weight to all those
prices fall back down and then
can build yourself really nice system on
the prices of that level in the new
market so if you're really kind of into
like just experimenting and playing with
the used market I think there's better
value there right now still okay yeah
Greg all right puron gaming
Greg worth upgrading from Arctic mx4 to
TG cryin on thermal paste okay I'm not
sure about Arctic mx4 Arctic's I know
okay I'm pretty sure Arctic is I know
I've used Arctic I'm just I'm trying to
think of what mx4 I don't know if I've
used a Mexico before look TG cry or not
so thermal grizzly is like one of the
best out there right when it comes to
the thermal paste I would say or you
know whatever you want to use in place
of that I think Arctic is perfectly fine
if your temps are high though you might
squeak a couple degrees Celsius off
those low temps but it's it worth
pulling the CPU cooler off cleaning the
dang thing and then putting the new
stuff on and then calling it a day and
saying wow look at those two degrees
Celsius lower temps I don't know if it's
really worth that I would you would have
to I really don't know it's just up to
you yeah you could just do it just to
see what would happen and the
experimental side of you but it's not
necessarily needed okay here Malaysia
Malaysia and birdsong Vaughn thank you
for that $5 super Chapman dude how would
you recommend someone to start saving
money for a PC also would you recommend
a hardline PC build for a first PC
that's a tough phone mmm saving money
for pcs I don't really know I mean I
don't know what your circumstances are
so I don't know what you can save what
you can afford to save you know if you
don't need something if you don't need
to go out to eat if you don't need to
spend 600 bucks on a cell phone or a
$300 cell phone can do you just fine
find ways to make compromises elsewhere
for the sake of building PC and that's
kind of we have to do when you're on a
budget I totally understand I know
exactly where you're coming from I'm
still like that to an extent all the pcs
per se but the other things you know
like I don't
free cell phones very much I don't get
free laptops at all and I still have to
budget those things myself and I'll look
at my budget I'll say okay this is what
this is the money had coming in and this
is the money had kind of coming out and
so I have this net right do I want to
save all of it do want to save part of
it am I worried about the future
earnings you know you have to think all
that through make an Excel spreadsheet
if you want it's it's just gonna come
down to what you're comfortable spending
and then hard line PC builds for first
pcs not recommended I would not go that
hard in the paint
I just wouldn't speaking from experience
the greatness for that $5.00 stupid chat
thank you my dude thanks for showing off
the windows to key for $12 helped me out
a lot instead of spending $200 totally
on on board with that look we're gods of
where you get it from and get from King
when you get from eBay get it from CD
key s CD key it doesn't it doesn't
matter I just think that those are
better alternatives and spending the
full amount of money on one of these and
these by the way I'm pretty sure om keys
a lot of people were saying they were
like a rip from credit cards and whatnot
that's old-school stuff I really do
think that they get these really old
machines laptops all these things with
keys in the backs of them or they're
just ribbiting keys from Windows
directly OAM stuff is is more or less
you know that's not the same thing as
people ripping them from cards McCraw
for that five euro super chat love your
vids got 2,700 ex of course they're
seven so I'm a Roman numerals double
thumb a little bit they're better than
my overheating 7700 K for multitasking I
can tell you didn't I can tell you
didn't change it thermal or the the Tim
there that's okay though look I I hate
the fact that Intel did not put better
quality crap between the IHS and the die
though it's so stupid that you even had
to experience that but I totally
understand where you're coming from
so the 2700 X is a great CPU it might
even be an upgrade in some case so multi
tasking standpoint yeah the 27 arcs is
definitely not great but maybe in a few
games as well that favor the extra cores
and threads you might have an edge of
their - especially for streaming doing
something else in the background is it
worth the overclock it's a worth it to
overclock it though CL 1430 200
megahertz Ram - good Ram I would say mmm
overclocking probably not unless you're
gonna do primarily multitasking
multitasking oriented stuff high thread
workloads just
leaving it letting XFR do its thing is
gonna be a better bet I talked about
that a little bit my 2600 at 2600 ex
review so I would just leave it if
you're content with that fine if you
want experimental bit do it but I think
could be perfectly happy with just
leaving it at stock letting your
motherboard do its thing
coalition gaming is another two dollars
to perch at my dude in EE ta
4 small channel review yeah I know I I
have I've been putting that one off
again I'm just I have a few channels I
already have set up I'm pretty sure I'm
up to three channels now I want to put
five channels so I want to be like the
title be like five small tech channels
you should know about like that's gonna
be the title something along those lines
and I'm looking to then truly have that
video published I want to get it done
before Computex though so before the end
of next month I think you guys would
love that video and I think that the
creators that we're gonna promote in
that video deserve the recognition
because I think they have excellent
production value especially given their
size I deserve more subs than they have
so we'll get to that eventually very
soon we'll get to that I apologize for
the delay there but I really think you
guys are gonna like that video a lot
okay okay Oh
Danko's erotica asks how does gravity
work my dude that is some deep stuff but
I love talking about stuff like that
gravity is like gravity all the forces
right gravity electromagnetic force on
force week four is all I think the
Hawking stuff I love it we will have to
love to do a video on that just as like
an old-school science studio video but
gravity relation to mass I did an
experiment back when I was in like
seventh grade about whether size like
the like if you had like let's say you
had a Jupiter that was a hundred
kilograms and five feet wide and then
you had another Jupiter that was you
know a hundred kilograms and half that
distance wide like two and a half feet
wide how would that affect the slope or
the warping of the space-time continuum
does the size of the object play any
role at all or is it purely a mass thing
and for the most part its mass I would
say that there were small errors in my
calculations of course because I'm doing
this as like a seventh grader in my back
yard
but through the math and stuff is
actually pretty cool to kind of work on
like some really basic elementary
theoretical physics
whatever else you want to call that
astrophysics I don't know I probably use
those words when I was in seventh grade
to sound fancier but anyway okay I see
these a super chat so you're gonna get
to these virility piece of customs might
do Tony what's going on Tony
what are you most looking forward to
seeing convict tags or what are you
hoping to see all right so I expected
we're gonna hear something I hope we'll
hear something from a video Nvidia
usually launches stuff or announces
stuff around this time so I got my
fingers crossed around the Nvidia hype
that's that's probably the biggest thing
we have some really cool things to show
off from companies that we work with on
a daily basis that I can't talk about
right now but you're gonna see in video
we're also gonna do some pretty cool I
think we're gonna do some collab stuff
like I've been talking to Brian and take
a city a lot Brian I have a lot in
common he's a really cool down-to-earth
dude and I'm really wanted to do
something like tag team with another
tech to you I think Brian's a perfect
fit he's just so chill and laid-back at
the same time the guy knows his stuff
and he knows where to find stuff but you
want to build a PC so I'm I want to do
something like that to change up the
routine a little bit you know that way
it diverts a little bit from the generic
Computex stuff I might even do some like
funny things too like all the RGB
footage we do on like our generic copy
text videos we're gonna censor all that
just make it all black and white like
anything there's like any RGB product
wringing it all up close on it and we're
just gonna grayscale it just something
to like just just to be different
because we're just like acting like
we're so fed up with RGB right so I
don't know just just something something
to change things up a bit but I'm really
excited to go back I'll be bringing Lisa
with me again
Lisa's my wife those you don't know and
then it would be bringing will again and
will is well there's a lot of stuff but
it has nothing to do with science studio
runs his own things in the background
marketing firms he's the guys he's
really successful but he does help us as
well and I'm very grateful for that
he'll be coming as well to help us out
and then look we get to we get to go to
a different country and an explore tech
that's an amazing job and I'm grateful
to companies who are supporting us in
that process the greatness donated $2
through the super chat windows on a hard
disk drive how do I change it to an MDOT
- are you gonna have software usually
it'll let you migrate there's gonna be a
really big P ITA
you know I'm saying so you're gonna
you check online I haven't done this
personally usually I just reinstall
usually you can recycle keys
and if you don't do that again just buy
a cheap key somewhere and and then
you'll probably I mean if you think
about it it's gonna take probably an
hour to two hours to migrate all the
data and that's not including setting
everything up if your time is worth more
than their if your time is worth less
than 14 bucks or 20 bucks or however you
want however much you willing to pay for
Windows key and then that's fine and do
it but I really think you should just
yeah unless you have important data that
you want to completely migrate over it's
gonna be a big pain it really is sander
McDonald $2 Canadian through a super
chat gtx 980ti g1 plus 250 dollars plus
250 dollars for vega fe worth it
I'm confused yours you wanted to combine
them what's going on Vega and which Vega
founders vision of Vega 56 or 64 I'm
confused I don't know what you want to
do there if you're asking for my choice
between the two I would say 92 TI is
gonna be perfectly fine you probably get
for a lot cheaper too I'm kind of
confused bryant's Ithaca thank you again
for the ten you guys are awesome and you
don't need to do this I appreciate it
thanks for everything have a good night
thanks Brian for stopping by hopefully
you stick around next time as well and
that we can ask get involved more
questions here I love these questions
let's see these questions I'm sorry the
guys we're not donating I'm trying to
get through the ones that are though cuz
I don't want to I don't want to
discourage them or be flat-out rude to
the ones who who were supporting us in
this way towstee productions donated a
$5 dude a super check what are your
thoughts on the e k WB a UK water
Palicki WB well on the e k water blocks
a gaming fluid series I don't even know
I actually hadn't even seen that stuff I
follow them on Twitter so I would see
stuff right away I just haven't checked
recently often check again and see what
you think let's see I just couldn't
google it real quick we have EK gaming
fluid series i'm gonna go ahead and
click control V there
fluid gaming oh it's like an all-in-one
kid yeah looking good actually not too
expensive either
let's see here complete dual 120 ml
water kit this comes with a reservoir
comes with a radio 2
40-mile radiator and fans this is pretty
impressive and you get a $10 gift card I
don't know you guys tell me what you
think about this I think this looks
pretty sweet and I would be totally
willing to to showcase this and do like
a little review video or something on
the channel I can't see my links what am
i doing I'm just gonna copy and paste
this link in here for you guys so you
guys can see what I'm looking at here
this is actually pretty cool sorry that
it's huge oh no is it over I gotta do
the bit bit Lee thing oh my give me a
second
alrighty alrighty yeah second URL
shortner shorten that thing hi here we
go alright oh why is it I didn't copy
what's going on what's going on copy
there we go hey boom alright
it's click on that link gonna take about
a new egg there's no affiliate link or
anything attached to that but it is a
240 mill complete water cooling kit for
your CPU and for an inclusive reservoir
again with a built-in pump and a 240 ml
radiator that's a really sweet deal in
my opinion what do you guys think about
that what do you think about that did
the link go through won't even if I went
through if it didn't go through me
pissed means I have links turned off oh
I see what it did it didn't do it dang
it how do I turn off the link buffering
you guys see it there yeah I don't know
why it was disappearing it might just
disappear cuz it's a link and Chet
doesn't like links anyway okay I see
yeah Roy Stillings $5 super check could
you please recommend a GPC be calm
before a workstation gaming PC on a
budget around $2,000 I kind of have a
few of these already on the channel I
have a few builds on the channel you
should probably fit your you know I'll
fit your profile pretty well 2,000 bucks
do you want a workstation and that's
your first priority listed that before
before gaming I would say get or you
could probably get a thread work for
build going around to gran so get a
thread Ripper CPU get like the 1950 X I
think they were on stuff like 700 bucks
$300 $400 motherboard try to try to
spend 300 bucks on x3 99 and then you
know gtx 1070 which is still perfectly
fine for gaming this is more of like a
workstation oriented build you know get
your storage in line get your case and
get your RAM you should be around 2
grand that's what I would say for $2000
I would go with a the Red River build if
you want to if you want a workstation
build but you could also go with Rison
you could there will is in there
Williams swamp swamp swamp if birth
burger with the beer I missed it I'm
sorry I don't know how to pronounce that
Oh Jemmy Torres good bye mate vamos a la
próxima is o proximo I need to work my
sander McDonald $5 Canadian it's a it's
my 980ti offering 335 Canadian owe for
it and a frontier 16 gigabyte air cooler
16 gigabyte air cooler I don't know what
you're talking about 16 gigs of ram I
guess in trade on another note I'd be
abusing my FSF 600 with a decade or a
deck of core and think yeah you'd be in
the upper end of your efficiency curve
there thanks for clarifying Sanders okay
Tory donate for that but I don't think
that's bad I mean look you can ask
anything you want starting for your
graphics card you might not get any
bites right at the price you have it
listed at so then adjust accordingly you
know there's nothing wrong with asking
more I know I pick on people and
Craigslist to do that I just point him
I'm like this is too much you know but
like if anything take that as criticism
and just lower the price if you're
already getting bites at the price that
I make you know that I point out that
you're pricing it too high for then good
on you right I'm just saying I wouldn't
pay that much I don't think I'm gonna
see the value in it but if you're
getting hits at that price then by all
means keep it there right it's someone's
gonna pay that much for it and so I'm
not gonna get upset at you for charging
that
so yeah I just got to play the market
I'm not sure what the markets like
Canadian Canada but uh I almost like
Canadians but in Canadian dollars when
is the next terrible PC ads video I am
working on a couple of those I will have
those uh publish to the channel soon I'm
gonna do one before I leave I'm flying
to Switzerland to see Lisa and then
we're gonna fly from there to Taiwan for
coffee tax so I'm probably gonna have
one uploaded and published right before
I fly out and then I'll have one
published when I'm in Switzerland so
that our Germany so that I don't have to
so I don't have to you know worry about
making too many videos while I'm there
because I don't have my full production
I want you guys to see that downgrade in
my production quality okay yeah oh do a
couple more questions you guys we made
eyes from what an hour and 20 minutes or
so now so couple more questions I preach
again appreciate you guys sticking
around we have 283 people watching right
now so thank you very much for that
not sure what you guys are doing on your
Sunday nights but the fact that you
willing to spend part of it watching
this live stream contributing in the
chat section it's pretty awesome okay
I'm gonna see what we have here scroll
up just a little bit okay mmm the
heatsink on my EVGA 1060 is terrible 82
degrees Celsius on 100 load it's a full
load getting constant thermal throttle
what do you think a water cooler within
sixty GP records Borg that's a really
weird thing I would I would tweet it
EVGA or like contact them on their on
their website and just show them what's
going on you know take a screenshot of
the temps under full load take a
screenshot or screenshot take a picture
of your card and just send them this
inquiry and see if they respond to you
if they don't respond to get at me on
Twitter and I'll get I'll get a hold
them for you but that shouldn't be
normal and I don't want other people to
expect that when they buy a PJ cards I
think it's an anomaly I would I wouldn't
recommend buying a crack and you know
all a i/o cooler for your card just
because there's one issue with your EBG
a card but I would try contacting them
first okay so I am Groot asks WD blue or
WD black for Steam library this is a
good question so I've used both the WD
blacks are significantly louder they
really are they're not like
annoyingly loud but you will hear them
the WD blues actually pretty quiet for
what they are and they're generally a
lot cheaper I would say performance wise
you're not gonna know as much of a
difference you know the the blacks
usually all spent at 7200 rpm whereas if
you go with a higher tier blue drives
they usually get a little slower this
one's at 5200 or 5400 rpm I don't notice
a difference between that 7200 now when
you're loading games per se so I would
say blue is probably the best bet for
just a general consumer okay okay okay
let's see I even purchase I saw the your
acrylic tubing bending Dew Tour I think
it was PT G so just keep that in mind
there's a difference on your channel but
are there any other videos in your
channel that explains water cooling for
real beginners like what what kinds of
things are you talking about like what
do you mean water cooling like the parts
you should get and the components you
should look out for that's a good
question I don't think I don't know if I
have something that's like it truly like
a down-to-earth like basics of water
cooling video I would say JJ's two cents
has a lot of those videos already yeah
he's been doing this a lot longer than I
have and he he's he's got the resources
there for it on his channel I would say
check his out for sure for now I will
try to get something out there soon so
that I don't have to keep recommending
only him I love J but I don't wanna keep
breka many days videos if I have videos
of my own so it's just an incentive to
to get on the get on my a-game start
producing videos like even though other
channels already done similar things you
know I still wanna I still wanted to
have my own take at it because I think
there are different ways of explaining
things
so just because one channel is already
covered something doesn't mean that
other channels can't cover it in a
different way and that's the goal I try
to set it apart stana McDonald he's
clarifying again frontier edition 16
gigs of H p.m. - I don't remember
Vega having 16 gigs of memory anyway you
didn't have to specify that it was 16
gigs if it's a frontier card they all
have the same amount of RAM standard on
a white bother doing that I know you
have attended a 92 TI you said you're
offering them my 92 TI and 335 CAD for
the GPU I don't know dude like I don't
know your market I don't know what your
what your currencies even worth I know
it's probably less than ours but I don't
I don't know I I can't really tell you I
wouldn't say is that they say no
obviously they want more than that
play up or down the price according to
what their what they're asking okay can
you do a Cobra Kai theme build Cobra Kai
I want to see those they have them
streaming on Netflix right or not
Netflix YouTube youtuber red
I thought those I watched the trailer
look pretty cool you grew up watching
the mr. Miyagi and all the old-school
Karate Kid movies i watch the new one
with the Will Smith's kid and it was
pretty good too but the old-school one
there's nothing that top seal then
there's like three three movies right of
the old one so yeah I might like I don't
know I don't know if I'd take Cobra Kai
is like my theme for a PC but I probably
Ironman theme or something first anyway
but let's see how dangerous is deleting
an Intel CPU without the D lid tool I
would say pretty dang dangerous I
wouldn't do it Roberto unless you're
really comfortable with yourself and
you're willing to pay the money upfront
to replace the CPU if you break it okay
Matthew what I see Matthew lumely I just
wanted to say in your video and
overclocking arcade chips was a godsend
for me and my 6500 isn't running strong
at four point seven cents then why do
you Mathew awesome yeah I'm not really
sure how Intel actually like felt about
that I don't I don't have direct
contacts with Intel so I really couldn't
tell you anyway
but I'm sure they probably look at those
videos in like that dang science studio
channel he's getting them to route
around our overclocking you know
guidelines basically non-key
overclocking right on skylake CPUs you
could flash an old BIOS it was
eventually updated and patched rec his
Intel didn't want you doing that but
there was a website that had a list of
old biases that would allow you to the
base clock overclocked locked Intel CPUs
far beyond the lock base clock limit and
though it doesn't really popular videos
people really liked those good they were
like that was value for the consumer
didn't want to pay more for a lock or an
unlocked chip and Intel being Intel is
gonna charge you more for a chip that
you can overclock versus one that you
can't all because there's just a few
things disabled in the CPU it cost them
next to nothing to enable AMD you can
overclock basically anything in their
lineup so that's just just my take on
the two companies tells you which one
cares more about value in the consumer
okay
what am I seeing here oh I see okay I
see one storm Capricorn can my GTX 1050
handle any game at 1080p 60fps depends
on your settings 1050 can handle 1080p
gaming but probably not maxed out
tonight to be gaming at 60fps depends on
the game and depends on the settings
you'll play around with it you'll get
the idea
1050 is not a bad card it's it's not a
bad card for the price but it's not
gonna be anything spectacular DK King X
I can't answer that depends on your use
case scenario I've got to be more
specific
okay Jay circ what do you think of the
x2 9 platform mostly 278 20x Jay I've
already talked about this and my old x29
videos I have them on the channel type
in X - 9 9 i9 70 100 extra view I know
it's not 70 20x but you know just watch
that video I talk about my feelings on X
- 9 90 in that video and let's see a
couple more here car decay bagua thank
you for that 60 dot a 60 Indian rupee
appreciate that our five twenty six
hundred plus GT X 1080 ti
or our seven twenty seven hundred plus
10 70 TI depends on your use case
scenario if you gain more obviously the
higher graphics card is the better bet
if you have a higher resolution at which
you game 4k the 1080i is gonna be the
better bet but if you do a lot more
content creation streaming multitasking
the r7 with the 1070 Ti is a great combo
it's actually similar to what I'm using
right now with this editing build that
or the streaming build this is a r7 2700
X and a 1070 TI and it games great
really does I mean all my benchmarks at
the 2700 decks review we're on a 10-7
ETI it's a great value
well it says I'm going to donate in yen
so it looks bougie
well can we say that in a politically
correct channel am elgu - we were 360 yo
Greg I got spare CPUs
what would you say performs better FX
8350 or i-5 3450 not going to overclock
in my experience look the i3 6100
outperform the FX 6300 in gaming the i-5
3450 despite being of
one generation older CPU or no two
generations older CPU just technically
on the consumer grade side right we went
from four to six is probably gonna be a
better bet than the FX 8350 if you're
not gonna overclock even if you did
overclock gonna be pretty close but I
think the i-5 can have a tiny edge just
for gaming anything else I'm not sure
Robert what did you study in college I
have a whole video on that I studied
engineering in college I have my degree
now and I'm working on my master's in
business okay Benji Benji Benji went
ahead said
whatever that is I don't know what this
is but it's like some kind of weird
language that does not use characters
that I'm familiar with all right one
more question
one more question folks I see 288 280
people watching right now I appreciate
you guys doing this on your Sunday night
let's see dr. X 70 I'm not I'm not too
familiar with Pentium 1 I'm not sure I
would Google that they Google would know
more definitely more than idea about
that mm let's see I see Matthew I see
Andrew come on guys give me something
good
give me something good Pat I have a
video similar to rx 580 versed rx 580
paired with r5 1600 the best value best
value GP CPU combo I have a video on the
channel check it out the five 80s close
to a 10 16 performance but a 10-7 is not
far off it's a good combo ok using the
XT build or build my own computer if you
enjoy building I would just build your
own especially thing about it for the
same price but if the NZXT build website
has prices that are cheaper overall
versus a comparable system you can build
yourself then you know buy it pre-built
for cheaper and then just this
disassemble it and the reassemble it if
you're that concerned about believe me
ok I see a couple more here Bennett
Levesque II says Greg are you a camera
guy I know a little bit about cameras I
have to ask a lot like I was just asking
Demetri from Harvard Canucks today about
something I was looking at using a speed
booster with a sigma lens for my g 85
and i wasn't sure about the crop factor
it was confusing me because like the the
meta bone and speed booster has like a
drop factors like 0.73 but I'm like okay
this is that 0.73 from full-frame or
that point seven three from my crop
factor that I already have on Micro Four
Thirds I was like this is just a lot of
mumbo-jumbo is confusing me there but
anyway Eugene Joseph so happy to see
Greg I have a lot of questions do you
know any good free video editing
software and what bitrate do you upload
videos to YouTube I use the default
YouTube 1080p or YouTube 4k preset and
Premiere Pro I don't use free editing
software I movies pretty good on Mac
side just because it's free and it's
like decent for all and I go video
editing but I'm not sure about on the
windows side I know a few people use
like DaVinci Resolve is a pretty decent
one Sony New Vegas or sony Sony New
Vegas or Vegas I'm confused anyway yeah
the DOS software is pretty good too but
I'm not sure if they're free I'm pretty
sure one of them is free other people
would know that answer to that question
hopefully they help you out in the chat
I'm sorry I'm not as not as well
equipped for that one okay and we have a
couple more let's see yeah yeah hardware
connects for sure yeah they they are my
camera work idols dimitri and iridescent
lee know what they're doing with their
cameras so for sure and then i see one
more here this is the moving frag
donation thing for that ten dollar super
chat might do I appreciate it I'm doing
an overkill build with a custom loop
there will be two CPUs with TDP of 205
watts each and a graphics card with TDP
of 250 watts can I get away with a
single loop CPU CPU radiator GPU
radiator to pump
alright depends on your radiator space
like if you're just using 120 mil rad
it's probably not gonna be enough unless
you want a down clock or keep your fans
at max rpm I've been to situations where
I don't have enough rad space and things
overheat usually it's when I have like a
single 360 ml rad I have two graphics
cards and a CPU it's not a bad gig but I
usually like to turn my fan speeds down
a lot and when I do that the fluid gets
too hot and then the system gets too hot
overall and things start throttling so
moving fact it really depends I would
say if you're gonna pair pretty high
wattage CPUs there with an average of
graphics 40 DB that sounds like a 1070
or 1070 ti
you're gonna be alright with I would say
to 240 ml rads if they're thicker keep
your fan curves up just a little higher
than you would probably be comfortable
with you're gonna have to just feel it
out it really depends on under like a
worst-case full-load scenarios under
both the CPU and GPU a 360 mo rads gonna
be cutting it close depending on what
your fan curves are set to so if you're
like it quiet a 360 mm might not be
enough if you like it average it can
even hear you know moderately then a 360
most probably enough but that's what I
will leave it at taupe I guess I'll
answer one more what do you think of
emulation why do you think people don't
talk about it more often emulation is
one of those like super gray areas that
don't like I don't think it people like
talking about it because if you emulate
right you're basically ripping a game
your your your I'm assuming you're
downloading a video game from a website
that you don't originally own or if you
own it you have to prove that you own it
and it's technically these sites get
taken down a lot especially in the
States because it's just a bunch of
copyright crap so that's probably why
people don't talk about emulation a lot
but you can you can emulate games I rock
I Ron XA asked if I'm rich no I'm not I
don't make very much money I really
don't I don't make anywhere close to six
figures I don't make 100k a year I don't
make anywhere close to 100 K years so
that'll tell you something and I Drive a
$20,000 car like this it's not an
expensive car either so no by no means I
am NOT will don't tell them that well
I'm not rich Jesus will I'm really not
you guys I promise I'm not okay let's
see all right one more one more question
yet one more question give me something
good and then I will click the live
button and finally get a drink of water
my throat's parched all right I just
want to say thank you for the videos
thanks I threw P oh sorry if I
mispronounced your name I definitely did
I think okay interesting
my man Zak thanks for sticking around
this whole time Zak I appreciate that
adora really depends I don't know
if an i5 is enough gaming enough for
gaming for you depends on what you're
doing while you're gaming the i-5 in
most cases is enough for gaming but if
you're going to do more than just game
five is probably not enough best card
for 1080p 60fps max settings around a4
85 80 GPU or on nvidia side of 10 60
would be enough for maxing out or coming
close to maxing out 1080p gameplay okay
alright you guys I appreciate you all
watching I'm sorry that I have to call
it quits here if you have a question
that was not answered I will do my best
to answer it next week the next After
Hours live stream this is After Hours
number 10
I can't believe or didn't anybody I know
it should be probably more than that but
there's been a lot of things on Sundays
holidays and whatnot that have
interfered with my ability to go live so
thanks for those of you who are willing
to put up with me on a Sunday night I
hope you guys have a decent at least
decent work day tomorrow or school day
if you're not already finished with
finals if you're still in high school or
what-have-you
and if it's already Monday happy Monday
I know I hate saying that
especially on a Monday alright guys I am
signing out thanks for watching I will
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
