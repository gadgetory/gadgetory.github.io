in the tech industry right now the first
thing that graphics card prices are
still extremely high thanks to crypto
mining the best mega hash per watt cards
out there right now are the 582 the 480
from AMD also the 1060 in the 1070 which
is why they are the most expensive so
it's difficult to build a PC like this
including an RX 480 to keep the price
under $1000 because these cards are
typically going in where between three
and four hundred bucks which i think is
frankly ridiculous but people are paying
that for these cards something else you
may have noticed ramen Storage prices
are fairly highest if you want to spend
on 60 bucks in an SSD that will only get
you 120 gigs worth of storage whereas a
year ago that would have easily gotten
you 240 Ram prices same thing you want
to spend about 80 to 100 bucks that will
only get you 16 gigs of ram 16 gigs of
ram a year ago was around 60 $70 so
everything is relatively expensive I had
to add just an extra hundred bucks on
the storage and RAM just to get what you
would expect in a build of this caliber
also the fact that the graphics card had
to be bought on eBay for around three
hundred two hundred fifteen bucks didn't
help either because this card is only
about $200 normally but you have to
spend three three fifty to get a card
like this now because demand for these
is so high and that's ultimately why the
price of this build came out to around
$1000 that's just the current market we
have to work with and there's no way
around that right now unless you have a
good buddy who's willing to hook you up
with some awesome free stuff speaking of
which the only thing that I didn't have
to pay for in this build or that wasn't
sponsored I'm including the prices of
the sponsored stuff anyway
over these cables up here so my friend
Tony over at his channel virility I have
it linked in the description he's the
one who made these awesome cables not
specifically for this build but they do
have the nice red white and black
accents and that's why I included them
here it fits with the whole a and B
theme so we have an AMD r5 1600 CPU that
only costs $200 TP prices are low and
that's a good thing I also have a
gigabyte ITX Wi-Fi motherboard in there
I reviewed it specifically in this card
right here the cooler I used was an AI
oh it's a deep cool captain 240 X one of
my favorite a iOS period it comes in
black and red you could also get it in a
white accent as well and it also ships
now with rise and support now in order
to keep prices under control because
this would have
exceeded $1,000 if I wanted the best of
everything in its class I only spent 20
bucks from the power supply it's the
Zalman 600 watt power supply that I
reviewed in the cord right here I
thought it would be complete trash it's
not it's actually fairly quiet and it
seems like it's efficient enough even
though it's not 80-plus rated to run a
system like this I'm actually going to
be giving this PC away and kind of
spoiled that I was going to save that
for later but yeah this piece will be
given away to somebody on the planet
we're teaming up with hardware unboxed
and tech city each of us are going to
giving away one system like this one so
this is my system that I'm entering for
the giveaway and we'll have more details
on that soon but I stay tuned because
yeah this will be owned by one of you
very soon and last but not least the
case I've chosen is the NZXT Manta does
cost a little over 100 bucks definitely
could have saved a bit of the budget by
going with a cheaper case but to an
extent looks do matter especially if you
have a side window which this one does I
just took it off so there wasn't a glare
on camera but this looks phenomenal this
entire build looks great inside of this
case here I think the cables make
everything pop as well and I'm digging
the black and red color scheme so let's
talk about performance for a second I
already reviewed the r5 1600 in detail
it's the one that's in here remember I
compared it against the i5 7600 K and
the i7 6700 K and the r5 performed
admirably so instead of engine blew
everything away and then in real word
performance Adobe Premiere Pro it
rendered a five-minute 1080p 60fps file
in a decent time a little under 300
seconds which puts it not far off from
the i7 performance mind you at 4.6
gigahertz the 1600 clocked in here is at
3.9 gigahertz as for gaming performance
what you might expect for a PC of this
caliber and for the price grand theft
auto 5 and 1080p pushing an average of a
little over 90 FPS which is solid one
percent and point one percent low
staying around 60 FPS which is good and
it's no hard spikes and dips in the
frame rate which could interrupt the
average gamer battlefield 1 1080p
looking pretty good as well average
around 80 fps 1% in point one percent
lows also staying around 60 fps I test a
doom and Vulcan because that's what the
system performed best in and we're
averaging around 110 fps this is really
good with an ultra preset in 1080p
the aim of the system normally would
cost you around 800 bucks last I crush
this PC with universe and
- an extremely CPU intensive game and
actually did okay considering thanks to
its six cores and twelve threads we're
looking at around 40 FPS on average one
percent lowest dropped to 20 and point
one percent lowest dropped to a mere 15
but I should say that this game still
looked fairly smooth while I was you
know blowing stuff up look it's a solid
PC for the price if all I had in my
budget was around 800 to a thousand
dollars to spend on components given
this current market these are the parts
that I would buy I would try next to
upgrade the graphics card to possibly a
GTX 1077 wondering what I would upgrade
next that would be it also probably the
power supply at some point I recommend
upgrading that storage is okay for now
240 gigs if you have your own like
gaming hard drive and you happen to win
as PC in the future giveaway and I
recommend throwing that in there just to
have your games on that and you can have
all your media files you know video
footage and music and your operating
system on the SSD you'll be good to go
if you like this video like the build
maybe like something about life be sure
to give this video a thumbs up thumbs
down for the opposite or if you hate
everything about life you should click
subscribe button that's the red button
down below I appreciate that
stay tuned for other content like this
here on the channel this is science
studio thanks for building with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
