graphics cards weren't coming for a long
time when's the next GeForce the next
job I'm gonna invite you guys done don't
worry I promise you know you guys not
only will you be invited you know there
probably be lunch question back there oh
I won't forget you I promise
yeah a little that's a direct quote and
we took him at his word I mean he's the
CEO of Nvidia after all and this
announcement was largely attributed to
the inventory influx many reference to
report that nearly 300,000 graphics
cards were returned by a single AI B
meaning gigabyte or a VGA or MSI one of
them returned quite a few either because
they didn't sell or because customers
wanted refunds either way it's bad news
but massive contracts like these must be
fulfilled regardless of market ups and
downs that's why they exist in the first
place and that may just open the door
for enthusiasts gamers and builders that
like ourselves
so let me give you some context let's
say EVGA enters into a contract with
Nvidia whereby they agreed to absorb
large inventory levels spread out over a
given time period these are usually PCBs
even if they manufacture their own
third-party PCBs the stuff comes from
Nvidia and the GPUs the memory all
that's contracted in so in the case of
Pascal that contract might last two or
three years and most abies don't sell
generation old equipment once the new
stuff rolls out and that makes sense
demand typically shifts right
immediately from the old stuff to the
new stuff once the next-gen stuff hits
the market and like every new release
there's always a last-minute splurge of
fresh deals on new but almost old
hardware so in this case we expect to
find some great deals on GTX 10 70s 10
80s and even 10 ATT is the lower end
cards are an exception we'll discuss
that more shortly but if you're a savvy
hunter on sites like Amazon and Newegg I
know I am I check most every day you've
likely noticed some great 1070 and 1080
deals currently 10 ApS are selling for
as low as 450 bucks which is roughly
what 10 seventies cost new when they
were first released this is great news
signifying a sharp rebound from mining
crazed prices when 10 80s were going for
as much as a thousand bucks and above
just a little ridiculous taking a look
at PC part picker price trends we see
1070 prices levelling out now at around
400 USD whereas in January of this year
things had peaked to near 800 USD and
they were selling at that price which is
why the market was at equilibrium a
similar inflection occurred for higher
to your cards just gonna throw that out
there but today we can see how things
have actually leveled off at or below
original MSRP keep in mind that the
black line is the overall average but
several cards are selling for lower than
this price quick glances at new I can
Amazon like I said reveal fairly
competitive prices RT X announcements
aside GTX 10 60s and 1050 t eyes and
even 10 50s however have struggled to
retain original prices post a bubble 6
kid 10 60s launch for roughly 250 bucks
back in 2016 but today you'd be
hard-pressed to find anything for less
than $300 3d models sure there's plenty
of those out there but you'll be
limiting yourself in certain titles and
as point out I'll recommend buying 3 gig
1060 the reasons for resilient prices
and these categories though are limited
in scope simply put these cards were
less affected by the mining bubble they
were neither as popular and nor as a
as their 1070 and rx counterparts so
they didn't sell in the highs of miners
gamers looking for high-end cards were
forced down the spectrum to ten sixties
and ten 50s which were already extremely
popular to begin with it's starting to
Thunder outside that's not good that
means you guys might hear some weird
rumbling I apologize for that
but look budget-minded gamers were
always interested in ten sixties and ten
fifties anyway just take a look at this
team survey there is a huge jump when it
comes to 1060 use over the past two
years since the launch basically and
that's because there's some of the best
gaming cards for the money so I don't
advise purchasing a lower tier graphics
card at this time unless you need one
right away we just aren't sure what
Nvidia will do in the coming months with
this category it usually takes them a
while longer to roll out the lower tier
cards in each generation and the prices
just aren't competitive enough to
recommend given their levels of
performance I mean use 980ti is 9 80s
and 9 70s will do just fine in the two
to three hundred dollar market if you're
looking for something that's a little
cheaper than 1060 that will give you
comparable performance but anything
higher than this and you've got some
serious thinking to do and that's why
this video exists I've already milked
the Nvidia r-tx launch so I won't spend
much time talking about it here you
can't check out these videos in the
cards up top or in the video description
if you want more context into the launch
but I thought about it what you should
expect instead what I want to throw out
here are a few ER scenarios right to
help you relate because you might be
wondering if purchasing now is even an
option so scenario a RT X is everything
a gamer wanted 50 plus percent
performance increases per tier over
previous Pascal cards great drivers out
of the gate and suboptimal prices I
think that's the politically correct
term to use in the midst of Nvidia
fanboys remember opinions based on
historical context are considered
clickbait and 2018 folks to be careful
out there
so with this scenario the obvious
reaction is to wait right for the launch
and dump money into the new family of
GPUs right well no and this is why
pre-ordering is stupid even if we assume
a comparable performance jump with that
of Maxwell - Pascal the price jumps
between each tier narrow the playing
field because our text across the board
is more expensive in RTX 2070 may bring
10 atti performance with a lower TDP but
compared to last gens margins it's a
lackluster even assuming that roughly
50% performance a jump which I have a
strong feeling won't be the case for
these cards we're looking at maybe 25 to
40%
give or take so these suspicions again
are
explained in the previous videos that I
pointed to the Maxwell - Pascal jump it
was so significant because the 90 DTI
performance could be had in a 1070 for
400 bucks which saved the consumer
nearly 250 dollars on average but this
time around the margins for consumers
are slim or non-existent and that's
again stressing the assumptions here
that the 2070 will actually pull out
1080p high performance and that the 2080
TI will be like this huge jump over the
1080 TI which will see it is possible
given the coup de coeur disparity but
several additional factors are at play
and those are again discussed in the
previous videos now let's move on to
scenario two
RTX - what's our tax performance is
subpar we're seeing roughly 20 percent
performance gains with this assumption
over a Pascal tier 4 tier and in this
case choosing to wait for the launch is
absolutely ridiculous of course you'd
have to know the yields of these cards
beforehand but let's ignore that for now
obviously gains are gains and we should
expect Turing gaming cards to outlast
their inferiors but this is where the
margins truly matter which is why
pre-ordering under any sense makes
absolutely no sense what if we assume
your plan was to preorder in RTX 2017
one of those may run you what around 600
bucks or so an attendee bTW I may cost
around the same or less depending on
when you buy it but you run the risk of
the 2070 pushing fewer frames at higher
settings in the 1080 TI this again is
where the margins really matter is that
a risk you'd be willing to take on
account of a pre-order because in that
scenario you'd be better off just buying
a 1080 TI and maybe saving some money in
the long run inside Turing is 18.9
billion transistors this GPU this chip
is the second largest chip the world has
ever made the GeForce r-tx 20 series
computer graphics reinvented the
craftsmanship is unbelievable this is
the best design we have ever done
everything from the voltage to power
regulation and the thermal management
system it is designed for overclocking
crazy amounts of overclocking not to
mention it is just so quiet 10 gig
arrays 78 trillion RTX ops 11 gigabyte
frame buffer starting at $4.99
like it sounds redundant at this point I
get it and videos loving all the tech
tuber exposure here but all of us at
this point have made what two or three
videos in the subject and most of us
agree that pre-ordering is stupid and
that's why I'm stressing it in this
video again because I feel as though for
the first time and a good while people
are either blindly going into this or
wholeheartedly resenting the launch and
I frankly despise both think it's okay
to be skeptical but it's not okay to
blindly hate the alternative is also
true blind love cuts both ways you'll
win some and lose some all I intended my
videos to do was to get you thinking
about the oddities of this launch I
wanted to call it a question a change of
pace and voice my skepticism something I
believe should go hand in hand with
science we once believed the star is
revolved around the earth it took a few
skeptics to change our perspective and
many of them are persecuted for it I'm
merely offering an alternative point of
view yet some still may believe that my
opinion is clickbait garbage and that
AMD pays my bills AM D hasn't even been
in the game frankly for high-end gaming
at this point and if you ask me Vega 56
and 64 for a majority of gamers were
absolute flops I mean the RX 480 and 580
and 570 and 470 and whatever those were
fine but 56 and 64 were not at the game
so yeah I'm skeptical this launch very
and to answer the first point in this
video why did Jensen mislead all of us
Turin gaming cards warrant last-minute I
mean maybe he wanted folks to buy up
current Pascal supplies maybe tried to
scare the public after all they had
quite the surplus post mining bubble
right and now they're auditioning off
the excess supply to a Ivy's so the
problem is now there's what do you guys
think let me know in the comments below
some more of a news video but I do want
to bring all this to your attention and
tell you kind of what I think about
buying a card now versus later
especially if you just really got your
eye on like a 1080 or 1080i for a good
price in my opinion if you want to buy
one now you're not gonna be disappointed
with 1080 performance or 1080 high
performance I don't think that our TX
cards are gonna be a huge step up you're
not gonna regret your purchase now is
what I'm trying to tell you because
you're gonna end up paying the same
amount of money for the same performance
or more depending on how the r-tx launch
and it plays out and how benchmarks roll
out in time I don't have our TX samples
and videos never contacted me for any
graphics card launch and he has not
Nvidia I'm not bitter about it it's not
why I'm upset I mean I was all for the
Pascal launch but
now things are weird and I wonder what
you guys think I know you've already
voiced your concerns most of you but if
you haven't yet speak up because it
means a lot that you guys actually
participate in the comments because I
read almost all of them especially from
the first day of the videos posting I'm
gonna shut up now give this video a
thumbs up we thought it's cool dislike
it feeling a bit opposite click that red
subscribe button if you haven't already
you can join it so we want to be super
special become on science studio member
and get badges and icons and all that
cool stuff catch you in the next video
