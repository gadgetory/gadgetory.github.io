requests for this PC back here if you
haven't already seen the build log you
can do so by clicking the card right
here but after lengthy debate I've
decided to go with the name Walter White
I am the one who looked uh anyway I know
that's a weird name for a PC but
Breaking Bad was the best show on
television period if you disagree with
me don't let me know that you do or I
will block you just kidding I'm not I'm
not going to do that but for real I will
so now that everything situated within
the case and in working order let's do
something unique there are already
several gtx 1070 reviews on youtube mine
of which you can check out right here so
i'm gonna stick to just one game and one
condition
that's GTA 5 and high or very high
settings can we keep a sustained 144
frames per second on a 1440p monitor
namely my pic co px 277 with a 144
hearth refresh rate let's find out
this test was broken up into three
different segments you had it one two
three
gtx 1070 performance in story mode 1070
performance in online mode and 980ti
performance and story mode for the sake
of having some kind of baseline these
cards perform about on par with each
other by the way now I don't have the
presets or settings listed in the graph
you're about to see so pay attention to
this slide right here if you're
interested in replicating this benchmark
with your own personal read you can copy
these settings that I've used for the
tests I had FXAA on MSAA off very high
particle quality grass set too high high
tessellations you get the point no
advanced graphics were used during these
tests both GPS were paired with an i7
6700 K clocked at four point four
gigahertz and 16 gigabytes of Gil's
super loose ddr4 at 3,000 megahertz so
we're looking at here are the men's
maxes and averages for both Story and
online modes with the gtx 1070 both the
1070 and 90 DTI were not overclocked any
more than they already were out of the
box when purchased to my surprise
frankly online gameplay you'll get a
higher frame rate overall for the 1070
this is likely due to the fact that a
few features within the game are
restricted to story mode so things like
wild life something else I was pleased
with was the cars performance and
especially grassy areas which is always
taken a toll on other cards that I've
owned grass and gta5 tends to take a
toll on graphics cards and I expected to
see sharp transitions in this graph here
but that was not the case I started the
frame counter at the same location in
the heart of Los Santos and ended it
near the Alamo see but can you tell from
this graph where the grass showed up
yeah neither could I and I'm glad it's
that way
consistency is a good thing especially
when we're talking about frame rates
over 120 so that brings up the question
this video is sought to answer can the
1070 run a game like GTA 5 a solid blend
of both GPU and CPU intensive segments
which is why this game was chosen at 144
frames per second well at these settings
no we're hovering around 110 115 frames
per second on average which is still
stellar but not taking full advantage of
our pixie o monitor so I decided to
lower some original settings in an
effort to bring back some frames you
might decide not to do this personally
you might prefer better picture quality
over higher frame rates especially when
you're talking about a hundred and
twenty hundred thirty you're really not
going to see much of a difference
between 100
20 frames per second in 130 some concei
120 to 144 but for the most part in a
game like gta5 especially it's not gonna
make much of a difference so that's what
I did I lowered everything that was
originally set to very high down to just
hot so these are the finalized settings
and now we're talking still not hitting
144 frames on average but we're pretty
darn close and I'm not willing to
compromise on in-game quality anymore
for the sake of any additional frames
120 is plenty for a game like GTA 1 last
thing to do then is compare the Maxwell
Giant the 980ti to the Pascal 1070 I
made the switch from the ladder to this
one for my most recent bill but did the
swap change anything that's what I want
to answer in this part well to be fair I
pretty much knew what I was getting
myself into the 90 BTI in 1070 are
nearly identical when it comes to
performance across major titles even in
direct x12 mode so in my case a swap
wasn't really for the sake of
performance but for the sake of
efficiency the 1070 boasting nearly half
the TDP and total power draw remember
they're not the same thing of the 980ti
both cards were neck-and-neck when it
came to frame rates we saw in GTA 5 the
90 DTI edged out a slight win when it
came to averages and the 1070 for the
minimums both of which are within the
margin of error but again if we're
willing to make a few compromises on
game graphics higher averages and
minimum frame rates are obtainable and
sustainable so that's that gaming at 144
frames per second on a 1440p monitor
with the gtx 1070 is possible as long as
you're willing to compromise on a few
in-game settings this is not the case
for all titles a game like City skylines
very CPU bound won't even come close to
this as I've proven numerous times but
if the game in question leverages both
CPU and GPU power fairly then these
frame rates are obtainable again if you
haven't seen the build log of Walter
White check it out I enjoyed building it
I had a lot of fun that's kind of the
point here yeah you might save a few
bucks in the long run deciding to build
your own PC from the ground up versus a
pre-built one that would cost you a
premium on average that just it's gonna
be preferential if you don't have fun
building pcs don't do it pay the extra
money for a pre built one don't worry
about it from then on out but I consider
building pcs a form of art and the final
result especially in this case is almost
always worth it Walter White is awake
still it's a weird name I know but it's
growing on me kind of like it
this is science studio thanks for
learning with us I am awake</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
