folks over at candid to bring you not
only to AMD rx for ATS but also a very
interesting and intriguing social media
platform that keeps you on the DL now
what do I mean by that picture Twitter
except without a Twitter handle and
without any personal info being shared
anywhere to anyone this is the beauty of
the app everything that you do is
completely anonymous now that might
sound a bit sketchy I understand why I
mean trolls in particular like to troll
on anonymous social media platforms
right you'll be pleased to know that be
candid has their very own anti-troll
security system namely artificial
intelligence as well as human moderation
to sift through any garbage that may
show up that way you only see relevant
info in any particular group that you
may be in speaking of groups I know you
read the title as well as the thumbnail
the GTX 1080 giveaway what you need to
do to be entered into that courtesy of
candid is obviously download the app
this is their giveaway all they're
asking for you to do is download the app
try it out and then join the Salazar
studio group that's how I'm gonna know
who is eligible for the giveaway and
who's not
now this is the tricky part because
candid is obviously anonymous which
means that just this once I'm going to
need you to identify yourself now don't
worry once you post your either
Instagram or Twitter handle here which
is how I'm gonna know who you are your
name up top which is gonna be some kind
of adjective followed by an animal's
name more than likely that's what candid
does to keep you anonymous that name
will change the next post you make so no
one's gonna be able to match up your
Instagram or Twitter handle to your
candid name
no worries you'll still be completely
anonymous but that's it just post either
your Instagram or Twitter handle if you
have both go ahead and post both it's a
perk of having to social media platforms
and you'll be entered into the giveaway
its global by the way doesn't matter
where you live even if I can't ship the
card to you we'll work something out via
PayPal you know you'll at least get a
good chunk of money it's gonna be 620
ish US dollars equivalent whether that
exchange rate is for you I know the card
might cost more in your country but hey
it's free money so you either get the
card itself or you'll get the money
worst case but I'm sure most of you want
that gtx 1080
speaking of which
for the GTX nad i'ma do something a
little different this time if you follow
me on Twitter it's not a requirement of
the giveaway by the way you want to do
that but if you do follow me on Twitter
you'll find a poll that polls asking
what GT X 1080 variant you would like so
I think I'm gonna have four or five up
there just click the one that you prefer
after you click you'll see what a
majority of people have selected so far
and whatever variant of the GT X 1080
most of you decide that you want is the
one that will be given away I haven't
ordered the card yet because I'm waiting
on those results so if you watch this
video within the first 24 hours of its
posting then you'll be able to submit
your biggest entry for the poll again
not a requirement of the giveaway I just
think it's something cool little unique
you guys can have a say-so and what card
gets given away so that's all that
candid and I are asking all you have to
do is download their app the link is in
this video description to their website
or lead you to either the Google Play
Store or the App Store to download the
candid app and then join the Salazar's
to do group post either your Instagram
or Twitter handle you'll be entered for
the giveaway but give this app a chance
I really want you guys to try this thing
out I still use it by the way I know you
can't tell that I use it because
everyone's anonymous but I've been very
pleased with the responses that I've
seen in some of these posts you know
this was asked 16 hours ago best gtx
1050 TI variants 6 people responded
there so people commented my computer
won't post I need help twelve comments
there you know a lot of you are really
helping out I do appreciate that you're
keeping this this community on Candida
live and hopefully with this new
giveaway you'll be stimulated even more
you'll want to check out the app I would
never advertise something that I
wouldn't personally use and I also
wouldn't advertise something without a
giveaway just because the giveaway makes
it that much more exciting but a special
thanks to candid for making this a
giveaway possible and for creating such
an awesome app I do encourage you to try
it out even if you don't need help maybe
you can help somebody else out it could
make a world of difference in their eyes
and also try out something other groups
they have tech groups science groups
social groups political groups a lot of
different groups that might interest you
if you're just you know not keen to just
joining one or two groups here and it
has several different platforms
different groups and different topics to
check out maybe something that can just
fuel your interest even more than just
the stuff going on in the salazar's to
your group you have any questions or
concerns we should leave those in the
comments section below it's kind of what
it's for if you're concerned about
what's not behind me anymore not to
worry dad came by last night picked up a
lot of stuff that I couldn't fit in my
own car he's headed back home to Florida
now I'll be back home maybe Tuesday
night or Wednesday but not to worry I'll
still be pushing out content until then
on my mobile devices and then when I'm
home the setting will change but the
content will not
this is Salazar studio I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
