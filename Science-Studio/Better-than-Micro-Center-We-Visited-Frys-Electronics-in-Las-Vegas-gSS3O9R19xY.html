Hoover Dam right now just sightseeing
and we're still in Vegas for a few more
days so it turns out there is a Fry's
Electronics in Vegas and there's not one
anywhere near us in Florida so I figured
we would take a road trip back to where
we're actually staying in Vegas and the
Fry's is actually right down the road
from us so we're gonna go there and see
what we can find
I've never been to fries so I don't know
what to expect I don't know if this is
similar to like a Best Buy or maybe
Micro Center it's like a clash between
both of them no clue so that's one of
the things we're gonna find out in this
video
why does fries look like it came well I
didn't at all okay we are here in fries
workers are everywhere we might get
kicked out
maybe maybe okay this might be a little
overkill on the RGB you know when you
can see the strips just you know decked
out in the case I think that's a little
overkill all right so this is the aisle
of cases everything on this side of the
aisle is a kinase and prices are fairly
competitive here so check out an NZXT
s340 white edition is 69 bucks not too
bad it's pretty competitive with new egg
pricing this is just the acrylic version
so no tempered glass but that's still a
decent price if you want one right away
and that's the point that's why these
stores exist if you want something right
away this is where you go to pick it up
we have a Corsair 400 C for 99 bucks
this was I believe the starting price
for the case when it was first released
so these prices are actually pretty good
for what you're getting aero cool p7c
$0.99 bucks that's a built in RGB accent
so here we go s340 elite white 99 bucks
check that out tempered glass edition so
yeah these prices are actually pretty
good here check this out we even get
custom sleeved cables in here these are
all by raid max but I don't remember
Newegg having anything like this at
least the ones that I visited in Houston
and Atlanta so yeah you want to deck
your PCI with some custom sleeve cables
that already pre-done for you there's
actually extensions here which are good
for any power supply then I certainly
had that selection here at Fry's check
this out we're gonna see of gaming
chairs I just have laying around
everywhere all over the place and this
here is a sign of the times absolutely
no graphics card in stock that is
anywhere near as powerful as if she
takes ten eighty or ten seventy or rx5
80 or 480 on AMD side this is a this is
really funny here is a wall of 4k
monitors okay something like very
extreme is going on
outside of the store I don't know what
it is yet we're gonna walk that way all
right for anyone interested in tripod so
you got a whole aisle full of these
pretty sweet maybe this is this is a
text or can you not like pick up stuff
like that this is an off-brand drone
aisle I don't see any name-brand drone
in this row it's still pretty cool to
have such a wide selection do you like
guitars do you like pianos they have an
aisle for those yeah pretty sure I'm
gonna need this one right here it's for
all those kids out there with parents
who are technologically challenged
there's Facebook for dummies they have
hacking for dummies I'm really tempted
okay so that's supposed to prevent
hacking I'm not sure if you could learn
how to hack with this book but I'm
really tempted to get it I really want
this one though this one actually looks
really cool okay here are the
motherboards gonna be quick because
people are looking very strangely at me
with the camera prices are decent they
have a great selection actually a bit
more presentable than it is a Micro
Center but the prices themselves aren't
the greatest and I'm not sure if you can
even bundle these and get like 23 bucks
off with Intel CPUs how would you say
this names it lick tech I'm gonna go
with lick tech okay those are CPUs over
there or just the prices so basically
you go up there you tell them which CPU
on and they'll take the tag to the back
room and they'll get you your CPU my
Christina usually just keeps them in
like a locked display case the prices
are pretty competitive I would say
whatever you can find here you'll
probably end up finding on Amazon or a
new egg for the same price so it
wouldn't hurt to to buy one here because
you can get it right away other stuff
that I want to show off here there is
quite a bit to choose from just not only
from custom loop gear this is all mainly
Thermaltake stuff you got your C 1000
colons down there kind of have a
love-hate relationship with that stuff
pretty sure the C 1000 clog might PC you
can still cup other things from them
though including these like full-on
dedicated reservoir pump combos CPU
blocks graphics card blocks yeah that's
a pretty wide selection here you know
back to the graphics card for a second
turns out they really only have RX 5 60
s
gtx 1050 t is down here and then 10 50s
it's really about it everything else is
out CRX five 60s rx5 50s GT x 1050 TI
this one right here is for a hundred and
fifty bucks which ain't the greatest
price either over here we got GT 10 30s
80 bucks
GT 730 s 90 bucks that's kind of weird
why is that 1030 cheaper than this 730
anyway and then a GT 710 for what is it
no I don't even know price isn't here
and a 210 if they had them in stock from
EVGA for 40 bucks well check this out
they have a Radeon HD 5450 s
when DirectX 11 was a thing it still is
the thing it's just funny that they're
listing it on the box
stream technology their stream core
processor is and that's just yeah it's
pretty old they actually have fairly
vintage hardware on this bottom section
here I'm kind of intrigued Dave do you
know what you're doing I think she's
having a little too much fun with this
is everything ok rip it cut you out
mid-game thanks for trying vibe good
thing we have on a home don't be so sad
this aisle is basically everything
peripheral and that's cool we have here
mouse pads a yep the whole section for
mouse pads cables I mean look this this
whole store is enormous it's huge so I'm
trying to keep the camera out of views
workers but this thing is huge I would
say it's about the size of most micro
centers maybe a bit larger and you can
find basically everything here anything
you need to build a computer that's for
sure all right if you want fans this is
your aisle and then if you want buckets
because who doesn't need a bucket
you got buckets right here it's pretty
funny they got fries looking like a 70s
or 80s movie theater so this place was
actually pretty cool surprised we didn't
get caught filming in it I don't
recommend you do that I'm pretty sure
it's against their policy we just asked
for forgiveness instead of permission
and I hope you guys really enjoy the
content it's just another place that we
get to travel into and inspect prices in
and I think that there were some very
competitive prices that
should take note of especially if you
want to build a PC anytime soon thanks
for coming along with me babe I
appreciate it
yeah we can go eat are the autofocus is
really going crazy right now all right
so this is science studio thanks for I
guess I forgot to do like thumbs-up
thumbs-down thing but you know what to
do this is science studio thanks for
rambling with us
