kind of an old-school elementary science
experiment here I have a tempered glass
panel from a fan Tech's p400s and we're
going to see how high we have to drop
this thing in order for the tempered
glass to shatter in a nutshell a glass
panel is tempered by undergoing a
heating process followed by a rapid
cooling of the outside of the glass
which forces it into a sort of
compression the inside of the glass
cools much more slowly which tends to
pull away from the outside edges and
that puts the inside of the glass into
tension the result is a very sturdy
glass actually about four times stronger
than regular glass the issue though is
that when it does shatter you better
have a broom handy for those who are
wondering our test will be conducted on
just pavement here like typical street
pavement and it's pretty rocky so this
will kind of simulate a worst-case
scenario here for a dropping tempered
glass I imagine most people would either
drop this glass on carpet or hardwood or
tile but this is a bit rougher so it's
gonna break anywhere it's going to break
here we've just got a bedsheet that
we've turned kind of into a makeshift
painters blanket so that's gonna capture
most of the glass hopefully when this
shattered and the thing about tempered
glass I was saying earlier is that when
this stuff does break it really breaks
it shatters into a thousand pieces if
not more as we want to make sure that we
can gather as much of it but then the
blanket as we can when it does break
will sweep the rest from the road
for the first part of this test we're
only gonna drop the glass from about a
foot high again I don't know when this
is gonna break if it even will from
upwards of three four feet but this is
gonna be our first test so foot high
just this distance here here we go
that's pretty strong I'm surprised that
didn't break it
all right now I'm gonna drop it from the
same height but this time parallel with
the ground see if this makes any
difference
now for test number three we're gonna
drop this vertically from two feet high
is about two feet looks about right here
we go this is pretty sturdy stuff all
right and now two feet high horizontally
I don't even see scratches on this thing
all right so we keep having to push this
camera further and further back so this
is three feet from a vertical drop
roughly three feet so you can see here
this is about the only damage this
tempered glass panel took from a 3-foot
vertical drop I mean I'm surprised
really by the way you should definitely
wear some safety goggles if you do
something like this for whatever reason
do as I say not as I do so this is gonna
be a 3-foot horizontal drop now there
aren't even any scratches on it you
could literally stick this back on the
PC case sell it on Craigslist and nobody
would know that we drop this thing
multiple times on concrete from several
feet high all right so here's where we
are at this point so after two three
foot drops one from a vertical position
and one from a horizontal position
relative to the floor
the glass has literally taken on almost
no damage you can see that the only
damage is right here on this corner and
that's where it hit the concrete first I
believe so for anybody concerned about
tempered glass rigidity and toughness
and durability as I've heard a lot of
people say oh yeah buy tempered glass
it's just gonna break on me if I drop it
first off I hope you don't plan on
dropping your PC or any component from
three feet high but even if this thing
fell from three feet high in a
worst-case scenario on some concrete
like this your glass is likely not to
break stay tuned though but we're gonna
keep dropping this from higher in higher
elevations until we do get it to shatter
all right so it's getting kind of freaky
now for a fourth set of tests I'm gonna
drop this from shoulder height I'm about
five nine five tens this is probably
around five feet high and I don't know
why you would have your PC this high off
the ground maybe it's on the top of a
bookshelf or something weird like that
but I'd say this is beyond a worst case
scenario if this doesn't shatter at this
height we're just gonna throw it in the
air
see what happens here we go a vertical
five foot drop what is it gonna take I
don't know what to do I don't know what
to do it still looks great
five foot horizontal drop come on I
don't even know what I'm gonna do now
it's just like what seven seven feet or
so let's do a seven foot vertical drop
it's gonna be pretty explosive I'm gonna
turn around and there we go you see how
it's shattered into well over a thousand
pieces uh that's what tempered glass
does by nature of how it's made
so yeah about seven feet onto a pretty
rough concrete is what its gonna take
at least for this particular panel to
get it to shatter into a thousand pieces
and there we go
this is uh one of the remaining pieces
that is now breaking into any other
pieces of our fantex p400s tempered
glass panel all right good to be back
it's hot outside so a few general
conclusions we can make about this
little experiment here the first is that
tempered glass is relatively sturdy it's
gonna withstand some pretty serious
drops as we've just proven even on some
of the worst terrain possible this is
thanks to the way the glass is in fact
tempered that would downside to this is
that if it does happen to shatter it
will do so into a thousand pieces
one other generalization I would like to
make to those who often classify
tempered glass cases into that fragile
category oh I don't want to drop my
glass and have it shatter look it's
pretty tough in fact I would be more
concerned about the floor in which you
drop the panel then the panel itself
that's what this video sought to prove
if you'd like to see more videos like
this on the channel let me know by
giving this one a thumbs up I do
appreciate that also don't be shy about
clicking that red subscribe button down
below pretty sure you're not gonna
regret it
