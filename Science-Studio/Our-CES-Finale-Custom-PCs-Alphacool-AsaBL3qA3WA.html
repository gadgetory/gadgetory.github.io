lien leave you sonic fan takes and deep
cool for sending us to CS 2019 what is
going on everyone we are here in the
Alpha cool suite at the Mirage the first
time we've been here for CES and this is
actually giving our last videos but
we've saved some good stuff for the end
so we're gonna start off with some of
the stuff that alpha cool is currently
offering this first here is the ice bear
extreme now it's based on a two hundred
eighty millimeter radiator but what they
do is they package all of this basically
everything you'd want in an AR bowl and
a IO or a custom loop into this big
package right here it's extremely heavy
I'd say in the realm of maybe fifteen
pounds or so so you've got the two
eighty mil rat in here and then you have
two silent wings three 140 mm fans built
into it and then up top you also have
space for the reservoir so you actually
fill this thing up with your fluid as
well as a pump so this is basically an
all-in-one potentially custom cooling
kit if you really want to get fancy with
it all these fittings basically orgy
quarter which means you can pretty much
use this kit with anything you can pick
your own CPU block if you want you could
even connect these to graphics card
blocks and you can get more tubing for
this kit so you can run a full-on custom
loop so it's actually extremely
versatile and that's a great thing about
this now it's not gonna be cheap I
pretty sure if I recall correctly in the
realm of like two to three hundred bucks
but again if you think about how
expensive custom cooling is in general
it's really nice to have this just one
single piece here that pretty much does
everything for you it's gonna be taking
up quite a bit of space though so makes
you have a case that's big enough to
house it's gonna be above 280 mm
slightly wider dimension and it is much
longer as well much taller because you
have so much space up top for the
reservoir so this is just what I wanted
to start off with overclock a that's the
best of CES Award for 2019 and I can see
why because it's a Haas it's the ice
bear extreme the name describes it
beautifully and yeah I'm actually going
to get my hands I want to be soon and
test it out first hand see how just how
efficient and how well this thing cool
something like say an i-9 9900 k now
this is the ice block for the r-tx 2080s
and 2080 t is it's looking really good
this comes in a variety of different
flavors but I like this one the most
because you got this plexi cutout here
so you can see the fluid moving through
the block and also see it back plates
included which is not something you see
from every other water cooling
manufacturer and another thing about
this one is a pretty sweet selling point
is the fact that the back play actually
sits flush with the rest of the block so
when you look at it from this angle from
the left side you can't even tell that
there's a back back plate on there just
because it is again synced up so flush
with the rest of the block so this is
beautifully engineered and whenever we
throw another custom loop together I
think we're gonna build Lisa a custom
loop here soon this is what I want to
use for her build now I want to show you
guys a few mods Mike from PC customs put
this one together I like following Mike
on Facebook here I get to see his
progress over time and this one is
absolutely beautiful I got a thing for
purple builds a purple coolants looking
really nice it's opaque and then we also
have the isobaric stream in here now you
can actually buy the solo Ice Bear
Xtreme we didn't say that earlier but if
you want just the radiator housing which
will also include the pump as well as
the reservoir then that's really all
you're gonna need again apart from
either the CPU or the graphics card
block or both and then tubing and
fittings so you don't actually need a
standalone reservoir because the iceburg
extreme has one built in and this is a
potential build that you could put
together with this unit so I saved you a
lot of time save you some runs because
again you have to you know either have a
standalone pump and then stand around
standalone res and that can take time to
include in a loop but all of its
included here and that's actually really
convenient for our custom builders and
this one is from joe and josh from mod
my mods i also follow them on facebook
and elsewhere i like seeing the progress
of their custom loops and had fully
modded cases and builds this one is
absolutely people I think it's my
favorite just because they've done some
unique stuff with the loop itself
they've used some really cool components
from primarily alpha cool in here
including a dual pump array down at the
bottom which is not something you see
every day this is one loop per se but
the way they've done this is they've
actually run the pump up to the
standalone reservoir you can see that
there and then you have a radiator up
top as well as a raid
up front but then when it comes to
cooling the graphics card and the CPU
what they've done is actually split the
loop with a t splitter here so you have
basically part of this loop filling in
to the graphics card and then the other
part of it filling in to the CPU at the
same time instead of having the loop run
directly into the CPU and then into the
graphics card so it's a bit of a
parallel setup here
usually we see parallel setups with like
dual graphics cards right now but you
could also do that with the CPU and
graphics card assuming that the pressure
drops between both loops are generally
roughly the same so this is a really
cool system you can click this button up
front as well and completely change the
color scheme we're actually using one of
Alpha cools graphics card water blocks
here and you can see how beautifully the
LEDs look and all these different colors
everything synced up so beautifully here
yeah this is a I love this stuff this is
straight up PC porn and for the guys
that mod my mom's did a really great job
good job guys one of the reasons why I
enjoy working with alpha cool so close
is that they're always coming out with
new crazy stuff they have so many
different skew so many different
products to choose from we just look
like what the heck is this like this
this is like a 40 mil will hide a
radiator actually good for servers which
is not really in our wheelhouse but
still the fact that they even make this
stuff to begin with is really cool so
you can be super creative if you really
wanted to use something like that you
could actually these two blocks on
either side of this rad our pumps
believe it or not and they just use two
male to male Chi Quarter fittings to run
the pumps directly into the radiators
and there you go you don't need a
reservoir you don't need a standalone
pump it's all done for you right there
an offic was make it as simple they're
giving you at least the option to make
it simple if you really want or you
could go crazy and use something like
this I mean it's a spherical reservoir
with a built-in pump looking at here so
if you you know if you want to get crazy
with it like alpha cool is one of the
first places I would look when it comes
to a customer because again they have so
much to choose from but they're not a
sponsor or anything but we wanted to
come here because they always have cool
stuff to show off and I'm excited to get
my hands with some of the stuff Lisa is
too because Lisa actually between shots
told me that she launched
on her own custom loop built so maybe a
video or two or three or four depending
on how quickly she picks us up is
necessary for that so uh yeah stay tuned
again this is our CES coverage it's
probably gonna be one of our last videos
that you guys see but I appreciate y'all
watching I know you've probably seen
five or ten videos at least from
different tech tubers of regarding the
same products we try to be a little
different here let us know in the
comments section what you thought of our
coverage and what you like to see in the
future
this is science to do thanks for
traveling with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
