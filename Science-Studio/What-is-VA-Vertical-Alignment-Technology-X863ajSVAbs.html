here we condense and simplify for the
sake of time if you're looking for more
drawn out in-depth analyses check out
our crash course playlist here in this
video we're going to talk about vertical
alignment if you haven't yet seen my IPS
versus OLED video I invite you to watch
that before diving into this topic it'll
just help make things a bit more clear
in a nutshell the distinction between
OLED and LCD it resides in its light
source OLED panels use organic diodes to
generate their own light while liquid
crystal displays utilize an LED or CFL
backlight source more commonly the
former today pros and cons are discussed
in the crash course video vertical
alignment or VA technology is very
similar architecture to IPS or inter
plane switching technology when current
is passed through a pixel liquid
crystals react by rotating 90 degrees in
the vertical in the case of V a hence
the name or untwisting in the case of
IPS this is thanks to tiny pairs of
electrodes that share the same plane
liquid crystals and IPS pixels are
always parallel to the glass substrate
this is what differentiates IPS from T
in but untwist still by varying degrees
with respect to distance from the dual
lecture of Apex
by contrast LCS and VA pixels rotate
perpendicular to the glass substrate
hence the name as a result more or less
light from the backlight underneath is
allowed to pass through said pixel with
varying degrees of applied voltage color
filters alter backlight wavelengths for
various RGB shades and polarisers
straighten out the race but what does
this mean for the average consumer which
should you look for in your next display
will start with budget first VA panels
are often offered as cheaper IPS
alternatives much in the same way that
TN or twisted nematic is marketed but if
you ask me VA offers a much cleaner look
than T and I think most would agree here
especially at sharp angles and the
refresh rate advantages of TN are no
longer very relevant plenty of VA panels
are currently offered at up to an
exceeding 120 Hertz so a VA panels will
be cheaper than IPS but generally a bit
more expensive than TN panels but what
about the visual trade-offs for one
viewing angles IPS technology is still
the superior technology in this category
and that's why it's great for large
living rooms and even ultra wide
monitors VA panels aren't bad but IPS
screens are still no
possibly better we're talking nearly 180
degrees of undistorted coloration
another advantage of IPS technology is
color reproduction this is a category to
which content creators should pay
special attention these panels will
often very closely mimic the srgb gama
not to say that VA panels don't have
excellent color reproduction but IPS
screens are typically a bit better
the last perk of IPS response times
since crystals in these displays need
only pivot horizontally by varying
degrees they can react quickly to sudden
start voltage shifts in most cases grade
to grade testing reveals slight ghosting
in VA panels whose crystals must rotate
a sum of 90 degrees which is a bit more
distance to cover in total than the
liquid crystals and IPS technology when
choosing VA for a gaming panel try to
find one with around 5 milliseconds of
response time or lower on the contrary
very few IPS counterparts will be higher
than 5 milliseconds so you should be
fine in this department not all is bad
for VA though there are actually a few
noteworthy advantages of choosing
vertical alignment over IPS one of which
being contrast ratios they can be
anywhere from two to three times higher
than IPS thanks to Crystal Arrangements
when in the off position blocking more
light from the source underneath black
uniformity is also superior on VA panels
IPS panels generally exhibit more bleed
around corners and even in splotches
near their centers look no monitor is
perfect there will always be some sort
of trade-off yes
Oh lid also falls into this category but
it's great that we have these different
technologies to choose from competition
is a good thing it encourages innovation
