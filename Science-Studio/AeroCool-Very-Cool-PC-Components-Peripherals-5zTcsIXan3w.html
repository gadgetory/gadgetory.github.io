sending us to Computex 2017 what is up
everyone I am here at the arrow cool
booth coputex 2017
I shared a few times live to Instagram
when Bobby Tex first started air opals
in a very cool thing in the next room
right now we're going to start off with
project seven these nice comfortable
chairs are still the prototype phase the
prices are available see description for
more details also interesting built
behind and including you uh-oh theme to
build let's check them out oh yeah get a
zoomin on that Jacob oh yeah bumping now
we know you can't see much in this bill
we'll talk about the case here in a
second but this is the Aero cooled p7 a1
cooler
atop the CPU RGB integration up top as
well as on the fan that's an excellent
combo now this is another mod from iid
this was actually based on a well I
don't know how if the describe it's like
a puppet TV show you have to double
check your time getting this right so
apparently it's a character in the show
it's kind of a weird show frankly that
has two like colors on its face but one
black and one's right am I saying this
right okay cool so that explains why the
coolant is black and white well are
using it looks like white piping here
and then the cooling itself is black
it's actually really cool combination
and that makes sense apparently this is
the puppet so also watch that show if
you're wondering about specs there's an
i7 7700 in here we're also using the msi
h 270 tomahawk arctic motherboard we
have ddr4 I think it looks like eight
gigabyte sticks four of those and then a
gtx 1070 from msi now this case right
here is the arrow cooled p7 c1 pro black
i have the pro white in the other room
you'll see here shortly it's a mid 80 x
case with a beautiful tempered-glass
left side panel and support for a
plethora of radiators you can do a
custom loop in here actually got the a
IO from an arrow cool that we'll check
out here shortly
it also comes with the p7 hub which
allows you to integrate a bunch of RGB
components from air cooled fans the AO
itself including the case RGB LEDs up
front here's the front shot of the P 71
probe lightly plenty of airflow we have
three pre-installed RGB fans in the
front also the RGB LED spanning the
entire frame up top here we have an
integrated SD card reader among the
standard
up top which is the unique feature I
like that and then also plenty of air
flow opportunities on the top of the
case now this is the arrow pool p7 speed
zero a slightly different take on the c1
slightly smaller as well but it is still
a mid ACX power still has plenty of air
flow up front it's actually sporting
horizon 1700 x build inside now this is
the Aero cool quartz pro which is
actually a full sized tower there are
ten PCIe slots here at the rear you can
actually orient a radiator fan combo
facing outward
you can also throw fans in the front and
a top there's a lot of space here for EA
CX motherboards not a problem full-sized
basement standing the bottom and it's
like for hard drive trades here at the
bottom as well and in case you were
wondering
Eric wall also specializes in gaming
peripherals among them are keyboards
mice and gaming headsets oh and if
you're interested cool with your mouse
pads and other naming schemes are
actually pretty simple which I
appreciate the first of these is the
keyboard the ak7 we have a headset up
here up top also RGB compatible it
sounds pretty good by the way
the a h7 and then this here is the a m5
for Mouse you can see where they're
going with this this does not have any
RGB ring around the side that the am7
does over
here there you go Jacob good work okay
so we are in the gaming corner of the
Eric cool booth I'm here with Lisa who
is a professional csgo player is that
correct
yeah that's correct okay cool and what
we're doing is at this point is just
showcasing what Eric Poole has done with
the booth they've actually sectioned it
off based on certain preferences of a
gamer has per corner his corner I have
my corner over the editing section we'll
talk about that probably in the second
video by this point but I think it's
very cool that they're doing this
because they're showing that all of
their products can apply to a wide array
of applications so we're going to call
it quits for this video we have other
things to show you around the booth this
is a huge booth including our editing
section around the corner stay tuned for
that video this is science studio thanks
for traveling with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
