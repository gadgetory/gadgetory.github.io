the fantex sweet Computex 2018 and we're
gonna start things off first with a
revision of the fantex evolved case I
like seeing revisions of cases because
look it tells the consumer that the
company is working to improve things
that have already been tried and true
the evolve X is the next step and let me
tell you it's in the right direction
folks I know you can't see it just by
looking into the case but there are two
systems in here you might be wondering
okay where's the second system it's got
to be an ITX system maybe it's under
these graphics cards there are three of
them packed into here one vertical
vertical graphics card mounting is
supported then we have two graphics
cards plugged into the ATX system but
the ITX system the motherboard and the
CPU are mounted up top and that I think
is really cool especially for streamers
I think this will be a big hit maybe not
from a price point perspective you know
I'm building two systems on a PC is
never going to be the first option for
most people but the idea that you can do
that in this case with a simple bracket
what I'm holding right here and a
dedicated power button of course will be
at the back of the case is a really neat
idea now the improvements the evolve X
don't just stop here there have been
concerns in the past about air flow and
admittedly the front panel is quite
restrictive or was quite restrictive now
we have much more breathing room the
entire front panel actually has been
pulled forward quite a bit more talking
nearly three times the airflow from the
previous model so on the round this side
is where the goodies continue this is
where the evolve X has truly evolved
because now it looks extremely clean
thanks to these cable management panels
so this is how a clean system should
look on the right side folks but the joy
of this is that you don't really have to
worry about what goes on underneath
these panels to cliffs one on top one on
the bottom look at that I mean it's it's
decent you get the velcro straps still
right so your cable management isn't bad
but when you have a tempered glass panel
with these cables and nothing more it
can admittedly look a little rough so
fantex has solved it this time around by
including simple snap to use panels we
have one on the front side and then one
on the bottom let's see again hide your
PSU cables I just say two cables what
have you and the kicker here you can
actually mountain drives to the panel's
so we have three more SSDs down here
that it and show it earlier but we have
three more SSDs over on this side and
you can actually mount nine SSDs in here
with dedicated SSD trays and up to ten
hard drives up front and down below the
basement so if you're in the building
masses in typical ATX cases like this
then this one's definitely for you and
the last thing I want to touch up top
again one more air flow improvement
remember the tiny little slits included
with the original fantex evolved case
now we have mesh up top much better air
flow and there's actually a lot of space
up here as well so if you're you know
comfortable of mounting fans up top even
radiators having those exhaust or even
intake air got much more space now to
pull that air in or push it out now this
ladies and gentlemen is the fantex P 600
X it's looking a little rough right now
it's because it's still in production it
was hand welded but they wanted to bring
this to CES to show you guys and what
its gonna look like when it is actually
produced you know a few things that are
gonna be refined obviously aesthetically
speaking because it's still in
production but I wanted to show you guys
exactly what to expect feature wise and
the PC center test starting with the
hinge doors basically the same thing
you'll get with the fantex evolved X the
same rubber seals all the way around the
hinge is just beautiful and flawless and
check this out I don't know why I like
this the most about this case but they
told me that this was actually quite
difficult to get the factories to do
properly and I just I love it I don't
know why it's just like a diagonal
little indention here with the fantex
logo nice and subtle but it looks really
clean and I'm excited to see it in full
production later this year now on this
side things get a little little weird
but it's a good weird so sound damping
foam on this side too damping not damn
I've made that mistake more than once
but swing it a little more this way okay
I'm excited to show you guys this
alright pull this off more sound damping
foam by the way this is something you've
probably never seen on a PC case a
traditional PC case it's actually like a
fabric it's like a mesh fabric something
that you might find like a pair of
sports shoes but you know what bear with
me here
it's actually really efficient and it's
durable yeah so yeah if you're still on
board with this just hear me out
it acts as an efficient the dust filter
actually it's more of like a two-in-one
dust filter and it's also pretty good at
allowing air to pass through it so a
typical metal mesh around 60 to 70
percent actually pretty resistant for
what it is despite being able to see
through it for the most part it does
impede air flow and a case like this so
with a mesh like this fabric mesh up to
90 percent of the air being pushed
through the fans is able to make its way
unhindered through the fabric itself so
it's something that is new
they're definitely willing to try it and
I like it because I think it's gonna
catch on and I think people will be
impressed with the airflow qualities of
the case due to the fabric itself so
different colors are possible obviously
it's fabric and get in all shapes and
sizes and fantex wants to know what you
guys think what colors they should offer
I mean look there are so many colors to
choose from people are gonna be pretty
picky rightfully so they're the
consumers look at the truce but fantex
wants to know so we're gonna have a poll
on Twitter might be multiple polls
because we can't put you know a certain
number of options in each of those polls
so be sure to check all of them if there
are more than one and then you can see
that these panels here already have the
the fabric pre-installed so what they'll
do is sell these panels separately with
the fabric pre-installed and wrapped
around them already on it just kind of
makes it look I don't know I think it's
a very subtle conservative look and it
gives the panel's more of a transparent
feel you can actually see through them
because the mesh itself is obviously
slightly transparent
so if you have RGB LEDs maybe RGB fans
an RGB graphics card like with this one
here the fan text evolved ITX
you can see the graphics card glowing on
one side and then you can see some fans
glowing on another because now all of a
sudden transparent whereas before it was
not so just a way to spice things up
make the case more your own now we are
in the secret room of Mg and neo cases
all these behind will kind of script
through these one by one but these are
powered by fantex but they're their own
unique family they're going to look a
little different they're gonna you're
gonna see similar features that you
would find on typical fantex cases but
these are gonna be more budget oriented
they'll be friendly from a price
perspective they will not have you know
all the nooks and crannies of you know
the fanciness of the fantex lineup but
they will still be but we're gonna pause
there but but they're gonna still look
darn good here we go all right cool
these are actually full aluminum chassis
which we haven't seen in quite a while
from really any major manufacturer so
it's nice to see this from fantex
or excuse me mg now these will be priced
at around $99 a piece tempered glass on
both the left and right sides they're
premium cases they're just from a
different quote unquote brand a
different family of cases a different
approach to the traditional mid-sized
Tower and just ways to change things up
offer a bit more competition in an
already crowded market I'm not gonna
complain because these look very unique
already and now these are my favorite so
we have the neo Mini and then we have
the neo Mini G or the Neo Geo mini this
one is actually one I want to talk about
the most because you're gonna get for
the price Oh remind me again $79 you're
gonna get RGB fans to right to RGB fans
so I'm trying to slip there's a lot of
stuff going on fantex sweet today you're
also gonna get the PCIe riser cable
included this is actually the only way
you can install graphics cards in this
case is vertically so it's actually
really cool I don't mind this at all
especially in that x1 factor like this
you mount your PSU up top and I
old-school but it looks really cool
because if it include these stickers or
the tempered-glass to kind of hide you
know the cable stuff you might not want
to see with your power supply and then
you're gonna of course have your
motherboard in the back so this one
looks really good I think this one's a
great value as well for what you're
getting the PCI riser which a lot of
manufacturers don't include in cases
that support vertical graphics card
mounting you get to RGB fans you get the
tempered glass up front get it on the
left side and you get airflow through
the right panel as well which is a
unique look definitely stands out so in
summary MG neo is about the value it's
about what you get about the bang for
the buck not compromising on the
important qualities of a premium PC case
but also not compromising on the price
pricing out the consumer is something
that a lot of companies do and they bid
League don't even realize that they're
doing it but between 69 roughly and 99
US dollars that's what you can get with
all of these cases here I can't wait to
get my hands on at least one of these
and review them possibly build in one
and then give you guys the inside scoop
once we've been able to fully dissect
these chassis which admittedly upfront
look great that's it for the fan tech
suite again a lot we've been here for a
while but it's a good thing I like
seeing all the new products I like
seeing the revisions and the products
and I look forward to what they'll show
at CES and Computex 2019 sounds really
weird to say but it'll be here before we
know it
this is science studio thanks for
