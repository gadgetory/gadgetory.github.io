bandicoot the classic playstation game
that really sculpted my childhood gaming
experience this was the probably the
best game that i ever played when i was
around kind of 10 years old or so and
we're going to be running this thing
probably all the way through in a
three-part series we did the first
island here the second island will be
really care to watch this the second
island will be probably on my twitch
channel which i just started so that'll
be kind of a way to get people involved
on that side of things and then the
third islands will end here just kind of
as a jump through nostalgic times this
is this is a really cool game and if you
haven't played before I do encourage you
to get a hold it somehow and enjoy it
for yourself so sorry up first insanity
beach very simple level with the
exception of one part which you'll see
here shortly
boy boy by the way I'm not worried about
the apples as much lamb the boxes my
goal here is to get all of the boxes mom
bought oh I almost forgot and they
quickly sneaky little boxes behind stuff
they don't expect you to look oh well we
did pretty good okay now he's going to
cop this one box all right we did all
right now let's talk about three tries
by the way you didn't see the three
tries because that would be ridiculous
but a goal here is to cross all the
boxers out all right the most difficult
part about them is going to be not dying
yeah that's going to suck this is not
going to be a fun experience and you're
not going to see probably ninety five
percent of it there we go we got a gym
that's the goal here she's very able to
do that was something that didn't really
care about at all when I was ok ok so we
got one Jim we're gonna try did that for
every level in the game but I don't know
how much how much longer you keep this
up brothels get very difficult number
T&amp;amp;T boxes counts as do nitro boxes
actually I'm not a quitter yeah those
are in this game too so it's gonna be a
lot of very careful calculations going
on oh I forgot about these bonus levels
i remember these we got to come back to
this level I think the lost city is
where we get ice cream them so we'll be
back for that one yeah we're gonna
you're gonna like jump up and then time
it just right we're gonna we're gonna
try it i think i remember correctly oh
that was close genetically mutated venus
flytrap
now there's something under here that's
not okay maybe later on it was clean tee
box number one of those can you actually
like move forward oh you can move
forward and backward ok it's not
two-dimensional and I don't care much
about the apples not really that big
clear on me and Booya what about saving
money what did you do that did I miss a
box I wouldn't miss Fox oh all right if
we do it did we do it third level the
great gate do you remember it mostly I
think how much that it's like a new
crimes already are we gonna get it again
we're getting this thing so many times
it's going to go up okay monkeys oh oh
yeah that guy I remember him you got to
take my time one of that actually I'm
pretty sure there's another secret
passage here where you need a floating
gem so I don't think we're going to have
all the boxes anyway that 19 lives we
doing all right for ourselves right now
yeah see we need to yellow gem so that's
alright that's alright oh yeah this one
this one is a just got to keep holding
down that down arrow button we've a
little in and out if it just warming you
up there it's letting you know you're
about to encounter
at least the camera backs out of this
you can kind of see where you're going
ghost right you can't go any faster than
that thinks catching on me with that I
don't know if it matters that I'm
hitting those boxes or not I'm going to
do it anyway just in case the boulder
does not those out for me check can we
see the apples trying to help you out
but they're taking you away from the
boxes why is it why is he getting so
close to me why amelie Oh rad that we're
almost we're almost ten percent complete
through the whole game all right it's
kind of hard to believe this for we're
almost halfway through the first island
there's any level in the first island
where I'll die it's going to be
substrate because your water everywhere
not like any fish fish need I sounds
like dark oh really I don't have a gym
okay well if I can I guess the canned on
deck is this like walls and boxes know
what you think let's say about three
minutes or so two minutes I know you
guys don't know I'm cutting through all
the boring stuff but do these pretty
quick we get through this first style in
here in probably 30 minutes Oh Papa Papa
fighting the boss is our first boss of
the game apart from that Boulder you
should call that Boulder a boss too
but you can actually you can actually
stand on his on his throne right there I
did not know that oh ok that's I
officially declare copper copper the
easiest boss ever in existence too much
fluid temperature is pretty high right
now 44 degrees Celsius it's telling me
that my temperature is too high in my
liquid probably gonna probably going to
turn that off all right now hog wild
this one is a good interesting level
we're almost on the first I don't know I
think this is the second to last level
the only trouble here is hitting all the
boxes this thing is a terrible turn
radius I hate like he's so slow it you
were nothing right that was really close
all right come up coming up next next
one here we go offices I'm going to this
one right here please there we go whoo I
think that was the only difficult part
of this map I'm not mistake my Mary and
is also kind of confusing that use a
note it's which side to go on jump that
one
the other one we go under yeah remember
this kind of reared I remember this one
we want to thank all right so we'd give
me that gym whatever that is a diamond
maybe give it that diamond oh yeah no I
was younger I never I never got any of
those like though it never crossed my
mind but now that I'm you know a bit
aware of what's going on why do you want
to try to finish this game one hundred
percent non-native fortress this is the
one right here this is the one where I'm
not going to be able to get all the
boxes right away I think what r SQ
secret passages that we can navigate
through okay that you didn't know that
they're say it's not going to matter
that we didn't die just as I'd expected
we needed a red gym
no they're just teasers because they
know you can't go there yet know what I
just realized when I save the game it
doesn't save my lives because I went
back down to school when I when I jump
back into the Rolling Stones map I had
to I had to restart the game for a sec
that's back oh there was saying it I
didn't know that it was there okay I
know I know I missed a bunch of boxes
whatever that is it that is the first
island completed and didn't take very
long is about 30 to 35 minutes of total
play time most of it what you didn't see
because just be boring that's not what I
want to just posted the channel just me
playing video games want to post the
interesting stuff the stuff that will
make you sort of nostalgic especially if
you're around my age back when this game
was in its prime you were probably in
the you know the console gaming sweet
spot around the age of 5 to 10 to 15 or
so so with that I'm going to call it
quits we finished the first island of
three in total now the second island i
will be playing on twitch more than
likely tomorrow night i'm not going to
set that zone because everything you
know there's always stuff that comes up
but that's kind of my way of promoting
the my twitch channel now so if you want
to watch part 2 island to you can hop
onto the twitch channel it is linked in
the video description i hope you enjoyed
playing through island one with me so
here's to the nostalgia there's really
no other reason for uploading these
videos other than to entertained by
stuff that once really consumed a big
chunk of my childhood so here's to it
thanks for watching I'll catch you in
part two on the twitch channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
