architecture the term ray-tracing has
been floated around quite a bit but what
does it mean and how is it any different
than the current rasterization
techniques used today in modern video
games welcome to a crash course on
Turing architecture and raytrace
rendering just this week in video
revealed the Turing architecture dubbing
this thing right here the world's first
ray tracing GPU the insane compute
performance attributed to the current
flagship the Quadro r-tx 8000 apparently
will cost a hefty 10,000 US dollars it
sports 48 gigs of GDD are 640 608 cuda
cores and 576 tensor course those are
explained in this video right here
but these beefy specs mask an underlying
trait that sets the Arctic series apart
from its predecessors actually usable
real time ray tracing let's start by
explaining what we currently use and how
ray tracing changes all of it today a
real-time computer graphics use a
technique called rasterization it's a
fancy word for in a nutshell 3d modeling
in a 2d space
dozens of triangles or polygons as the
Fancy Pants call it attached with
position and Colour information or
sandwiched together to create the radius
at which point pixels are generated and
shaded to yield a more realistic image
we conveyed depth and shadows manually
with these kinds of techniques but they
can be expensive from a hardware
utilization standpoint you can imagine
how millions of polygons stitched
together to form various objects than
just one scene can require some intense
computational power hence the necessity
for GPUs and parallel processing with
hundreds or thousands of cuda cores in
the case of Nvidia add to that a frame
rate of 60 or even 144 FPS and you've
got a crazy demanding render to play out
not just on the graphics card side but
also the CPUs incomes array tracing this
technology has actually been around
since the late 60s but we were always
limited by our technology even mighty
Tesla V 100's relying on the new volt to
stuff had to run in packs of fours to
handle the Unreal Engine reflections
demo you're seeing here which is
currently using active ray tracing the
premise of the technique literally
involves its name tracing light rays
from a source to a camera or the human
eye no rasterization or shading required
you actually see it all the time in
movies
CGI it's how they blend the real stuff
with the fake stuff but the real kicker
with this announcement from Nvidia is
seamless real-time ray tracing which
they've been promising for quite a while
actually so this requires a GPU in
question to always be on its toes
depending on the movement of the user
obviously as your location relative to
the light source changes and we can have
multiple light sources here so too will
the light particles reaching your retina
the real-time ray tracing involves
chasing millions and billions of
particles around a scene over and over
again to depict vivid and accurate depth
shade and color if a particle takes too
long to say reach a red object surface
the GPU will calculate the corresponding
shade of red to render and then compile
an average that result with millions of
other light particles reaching the same
point at the same time from other
directions all the while mapping your
ever-changing perspective relative to
the object and the light source in
question and that's assuming there's
only one light source there so yeah it's
actually really intense and it's why
we've relied on rasterization and
passive shading for so long but all the
news about Nvidia czar TX brand and the
Quadro 8000 is centered on a specialized
r-tx cores dedicated specifically to
real-time rate raise calculations this
is thanks to dedicated RT core is paired
with tensor cores again discussed in an
earlier video making them perfect for RT
techniques we number one accelerate the
rate racing part of it we still have to
shade it but the the rate racing
acceleration is just incredibly fast the
second part is by using AI we're able to
render at a slightly lower resolution
but because we trained that model off a
very high quality ground truth we're
essentially going to be able to generate
the final image at a much much higher
rate and so we call a DLA a the
combination of AI and rate racing has
made it possible for us in Unreal Engine
4 with RT RT great real time rate racing
running on top of Microsoft's DX our API
this is basically today's most popular
platform
we're able to take computer graphics and
improve it by a factor of six touring is
six times
Pascal now RT course specifics aren't
quite known yet Nvidia usually saves the
technical stuff for later but we do know
that they accelerate rate triangle
intersection calculations that's a fancy
way of saying the point at which a light
particle hits an object surface down to
the minutest detail we're talking
multiple decimal places in fact these
core clusters are so efficient that only
a single r-tx Quadro 8000 was required
to run the same reflections demo we just
talked about for which for V 100's were
previously needed this board makes
real-time ray tracing possible and we
expect at some point in this in future
for these technologies to leech their
way into consumer grade cards we also
expect video game developers to catch on
when mainstream art ecards actually hit
the market which may be sooner than you
think
for now though we have to wait and see
if you guys like this video give it a
thumbs up talk about arty cores and
other stuff down in the comment section
I'll be there for a while be sure to
subscribe if you haven't already and
I'll catch you in the next one this is
