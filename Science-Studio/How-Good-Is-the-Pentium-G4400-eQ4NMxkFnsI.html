budget gaming PC build it seems like
over time we've been upping the ante
here in the studio and building more and
more expensive computers but I want to
make an exception because a lot of you
have been asking for a 600 ish US dollar
gaming PC bill and I have one for you
now this one's a little unorthodox I
didn't include an i3 or I didn't go with
an FX 6300 or even an 80 350 or any of
that I decided to go with a pentium g
4400 I wanted to kill two birds with one
stone here a few you've been asking me
about the performance of this CPU here
with only two cores and two threads that
was - I meant - so we're going to be
able to tackle those those
specifications and how that translates
to FPS and games and just you know raw
CPU power or run all the synthetic
benchmarks and gaming benchmarks here
shortly but we also will be able to see
how well it performs when paired with
both a gtx 960 and a gtx 970 so I think
I'm going to say I'm gonna throw that
into a different video so go and click
the link here if you really want to see
that video it's not gonna be there if
you're watching this one you know the
day this has been uploaded but yeah you
can check that out if it is there I
think you will enjoy that but for now
let's go ahead and run through the specs
for this this new pentium g 4400 skylake
build and then we'll throw some
benchmarks at it as is so here we go
folks stay tuned
you
you
you
you
so I was a bit surprised the Pentium G
4400 when paired with our GTX 960
actually did quite well in games
especially considering the price tag of
the computer itself I mean we're at 600
bucks and you could actually cut back
even more on that if you really wanted
to but about 600 u.s. dollars will get
you a rig that will play all of these
games at at least 30fps and 1080p but
some of them even above 60 FPS which is
quite nice to see games of course that
are very CPU intensive such as GTA 5 and
City skylines will struggle a bit more
but that's besides the point you know
you can always down some settings and
you get those FPS back so yeah you kind
of got to play with the settings a bit
but that's a compromise you have to you
have to be willing to make if you're
going for a cheaper gaming rig so far
from that let me know what you think
about the computer let me know what you
like to see changed in the build I don't
know I'm gonna throw that GTX 970 in
there stay tuned for that one leaked
like the video leaked like the video if
you liked it dislike it if you dislike
it for whatever reason and let me know
we'd like to see in the future
this is science studio thanks for
learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
