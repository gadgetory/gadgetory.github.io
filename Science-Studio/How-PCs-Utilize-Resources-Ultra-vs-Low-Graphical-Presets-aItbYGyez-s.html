video I ran a series of endgame
benchmarks using the Andromeda PC build
behind me more details on it in the card
right here in the 1080p preset which is
pretty standard for most Steam users now
the catch is that I ran the first set of
benchmarks in the highest possible
preset so ultra max whatever you want to
call it I turn the dials up on
everything the highest that they would
go for each of the games tested and then
I ran the exact same set of benchmarks
again in the lowest possible presets the
point of this video is to analyze CPU
and GPU scaling how those changes in
game settings change also we look at RAM
allocation system RAM not via Ram it's
pretty obvious how the vram works at
this point but the system RAM change as
we change in game settings and then we
also take a look at frame times and
frame rates for a few the games tested
as well just so you know you can kind of
get an idea for a system stability this
at this point we have 210 80s in here
and an i7 6700 K so we'll see which
games bottleneck which part of our build
so without further ado let's jump into
our first benchmark which is as usual
Grand Theft Auto 5 what we're looking at
here are average and minimum frame rates
don't worry our frame times will be in
the next graph those will tell a better
story than these two parameters alone
will now intended to be ultra 119 FPS on
average that jumps up by 50 fps and we
lowered everything but our minimums are
a bit interesting so our lowest FPS
reading was 31 for our low preset but
that jumped up to a whopping 80 when we
set everything to ultra in a nutshell
here's what's happening when you lower
in game settings your graphics card will
as a result not have to work as hard not
having to include as many textures it
will have to be as detailed with each
frame right anti-aliasing all that it
doesn't have to worry about so that in
turn puts more stress on the CP because
now the graphics card says well I can
process more frames because these frames
are as detailed so CPU send me more
frames to process and the CP is like oh
I'm trying I'm trying I can't keep up
that's how you get frame skipping that's
how you get these severe drops in fps
like we're seeing in GTA 5 and we can
see that happening in this graph here
both of our GPU usages were cut in half
as a result of lowering those settings
our CPU usage also dramatically
increased which gave us that CPU
bottleneck we can see this happening
from a frame time
effective as well the y-axis is
indicative of time it's the time in
milliseconds it takes for each frame to
be rendered the blue track is the ultra
preset we don't see many spikes high up
which is good we see the high spikes it
means it's taking longer free frame to
render that gives us a lower FPS frame
times are literally the inverse of fpso
frames per second its seconds per frame
now the low track which is an orange
resulted in quite a few frame time
spikes which is not good all of these
spikes here indicates some severe
stuttering check out these toward the
end when we were on the ground driving
the Hummer these are incredibly large
spikes in comparison to what the normal
track is down below if you don't take
anything else away from this graph
remember this more consistent the line
and lower the line is to zero the better
this is not good over here not at all
the next game on our list is City
skylines now this game utilizes
resources in a completely different way
than grand theft auto 5 does and we see
that first off with our GPU usages right
off the bat GPU two's usage was
extremely low in both scenarios which
tells us that the game is not properly
sli optimized the CPUs usage throughout
was also very interesting it was 91% on
ultra even though our graphics card was
also being utilized heavily that didn't
change much when we lowered in game
settings and only jumped up by 5% but to
be frank there's not much more room for
the CPU to to be bottled like anymore
than it already is this game is
extremely CPU bound and that's why I
like using it for just typical gaming
benchmarks an interesting note though
when we look at the frame rate graphs we
know that we're not getting the whole
story because we just looked at
utilization so our CPU usage was pretty
much maxed out even though we did see a
pretty substantial bump in frame rates
across the board also our second
graphics card wasn't being utilized we
would know that either if we were just
looking at this graph here some of you
might remember this next game universe
sandbox - I actually did a full on
dedicated video on this game and how it
bottlenecks the heck out of most CPUs
check it out in this card right here if
you haven't already to be short and
sweet
this game doesn't utilize graphics cards
much at all I imagine we could just swap
these 10 80s with like 9 50s and the
frame rate would probably still be
similar to what it is on the next graph
86% for CPU usage though and the ultra
preset that jumps up by 10% when we drop
everything to the lowest possible preset
giving us according to this graph here a
higher frame rate with a much higher CPU
usage
notice that our graphics card usages
didn't really drop by all that much in
terms of just proportionately
percentage-wise
when we lower this in game settings so
this game is extremely CPU bound no
matter what but again if we look at just
the frame rate graphs we wouldn't know
the full story now the last game on our
list is the complete opposite in terms
of what it utilizes universe sandbox 2
took advantage of the CPU heavily didn't
care much about the graphics cards
Crysis takes advantage of as much
graphics card horsepower practically as
you can throw at it and doesn't care as
much about the CPU check this out our
CPU usage did not change from 20% when
we lower settings from ultra to low
while our graphics cards experienced a
more than 50% cut in usage across the
board
see if you just doesn't care and while
this is an NVIDIA optimized title I am
pleasantly surprised by how well this
game handled an SLI 1080 config despite
its age again the same story with our
average and minimum frame rate graph we
saw a huge frame rate increase
especially in the averages when we
lowered it in settings but we would have
no idea how our CPU or how our graphics
cards were responding to this frame rate
jump if we just change things that
didn't look at usages in particular but
before you go on thinking that the
crisis developers had no idea what they
were doing when they weren't utilizing
the CPU as much as they possibly could
have here's the frame time graph despite
our CPU usage not changing only lowered
in game settings our frame times were
extremely consistent and a bit lower
than our old charts which makes sense
because our average frame rate for our
low run was considerably higher than
that of our ultra frame rate so this is
a good sign I mean this is actually a
really excellent graph or crisis
considering our CPU wasn't being heavily
stressed much at all in fact my
temperatures for my i7 6700 K at 4.5
gigahertz didn't pass 50 C at all at
this point something else I want to talk
about that I mentioned earlier in the
video how system RAM is allocated when
we change in game settings and how that
varies from game to game from this radar
here
GTA 5 utilized by far the most system
RAM about nine gigabytes that dropped to
about eight gigabytes when we lowered in
game settings city skylines on the other
hand actually increase in its system RAM
usage when we lowered in game settings
perhaps because our CPU usage did
substantially increase universe and box
really didn't care how much RAM we had
in the system to
Frank and neither did crisis but crisis
is a considerably older game against CPU
usage was extremely low and universe
sandbox relies on physics calculations
which deceive to you typically handles
but not much memory is having to be
temporarily stored to be drawn later
it's just it's just space it's pretty
much empty and alas we've come to our
final compiled data chart I have RAM
usage CPU and GPU usage all in here
not frame rates though because those are
typically a lot higher than usages by
percent if you want to download all of
the data that I've explained and
showcased in this video you can do so by
clicking the link in the video
description tied to my dropbox account
so you can download the excel sheet
there and use it for your own testing
your own videos whatever just say where
you got this stuff from because if you
don't and somebody asks you a pretty
detailed question you're going to look
kind of stupid when you don't know the
answer
lastly here are all of the average frame
rates just make note of the system
specifications which are also in the
video description if you're going to use
these somewhere else with that if you
like this video or appreciate the data
presented be sure to give this one a
thumbs up thumbs down for the opposite
click subscribe but if you haven't
already helped catch you in the next
video here's a special treat the i7 7900
X I think it's stupid for 99% of you but
we're going to run some tests on it
anyway what the heck's here right
this is science studio thanks for
learning with us
