not that I blame you this video is for
you we're gonna focus primarily on the
AMD Rison platform not because I was
paid to do this in fact this video was
not been sponsored by anybody I didn't
receive the CPUs from AMD but these are
for a project that I'm working on you'll
see that more in the future I also have
some motherboards from MSI this one
right here is the B 352 tomahawk Arctic
board to see some sweet b-roll shots of
that here soon but I wanted to preface
this video by saying that I'm not being
paid to say what I'm going to say in
this video I just think that the rise in
platform right now now is experiencing
some really nice price cuts something
you need to be looking out for upcoming
Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals
going to be really nice to see your I
expect they'll be better than they were
last year because we do finally have
competition from AMD so I'm gonna slow
it down a bit talk about where my
friends in the United Kingdom Canada and
the United States can find rising deals
on Amazon and their respective Amazon
sites also places like new egg and even
in-store in shops like Micro Center a
place which by the way includes usually
a twenty or thirty dollar discount if
you bundle a CPU and motherboard love
that new PCBs now
so I've got Amazon pulled up on my phone
I'll also accompany this video with a
few screen captures of just me kind of
browsing through Amazon if you see
anything you like
check the video description I bet it's
down there most processors on AMD cider
down there a few Intel competitors as
well and also be 350 and X 370
motherboards to accompany those rising
CPUs starting first with the bottom of
the barrel is the horizon 3 1200 CV this
is a true quad-core CPU with
overclocking support in mind you coming
in at a whopping 100 US dollars and that
is that's a really good price about 10
bucks cheaper than what it usually is
and this is what I would recommend for
somebody who has a really tight budget
they want to spend maybe 60 to 70 bucks
on a bare-bones be 350 motherboard and a
CPU like this and maybe 80 bucks or so
on an 8 gig kit of RAM which would be
the bare minimum amount of RAM I'd
recommend now with the expectation that
you'd upgrade later on to 16 you can get
a whole platform for about 2 to 300
bucks which is really good I would say
in the current market because Ram prices
are extremely high now step up from the
r3 1200 is the arisin 3 1300 X and don't
like the X deceive you
yes exact same number of cores the r3
1200 adds just a higher out-of-the-box
frequency which means that you get a
higher IPC for things like gaming and
multitasking in general both of these
processors by the way come with the
Wraith stealth cooler which is actually
a decent cooler out of the box for these
low powered chips I would say you'd be
ok with you know modest overclocks using
that raid stealth cooler for either
these CPUs it also keeps the cost down
so it's nice that you have those
included by the way looks like some of
the cheapest be 350 boards you could buy
to accompany those cheap AMD CPUs would
run you about 65 bucks or so here's one
from MSI looks decent I reviewed one
very similar that but this is in the
micro ATX form factor so it might not
look the best in a mid-sized Tower which
is what most people today use but at
least you're getting it for a really
good price
the next AMD risin processor I would
recommend in the current market is the
horizon 5 1500 X this is the best four
core multi-threaded CPU you can buy from
AMD's Verizon lineup currently and it's
gonna run about 165 US dollars which in
today's market is again not bad at all
we're getting discounted here about 20
bucks in gaming expect the CPU to run
you around the lock to i-5 sky and Kaiba
Lake territories still excellent i-5 are
still excellent gamers even though they
have four cores
good thing about the risin 5 1500 X's
you get that multi-threading support as
well so you can do extra things like
streaming in the background or rendering
a video or something crazy you could
certainly handle that task much easier
with multi-threading support enabled you
don't have that on modern I 5 CPUs on
Intel side now the next big step for
risin is the r5 1600 packing six cores
and twelve threads so we still have
multi 30 support we just have two extra
physical cores which means multiplying
it by two we have four extra threads to
work with the thing is though I don't
have a risin 5 1600 CPU anymore because
I gave that one away in a giveaway about
2 or 3 months ago so you just have to
look at me when I talk about this one I
think that for 189 bucks really anything
under $200 is a really great price for
the r5 1600 it is what I would regard as
the best all-around CPU for the money I
talk about in a more detail right here
benchmarks are also in this video
lastly taking a step into the big
leagues we have the horizon 7 series of
1,700 1,700 X and 1,800 X for all of
these CPUs by the way I recommend you
could get away with be 350 boards but I
recommend X 370 boards just for that
extra overclocking Headroom if anything
does change on a UEFI that allows for
extra of 100 200 megahertz that added
stability especially with RAM which can
influence frame rates in game the r7
1700 by the way does come with the
Wraith spire LED cooler at around two
hundred and seventy bucks which is a
really good price I wouldn't recommend
sticking with the stock cooler I mean
you could temporarily it is nice that
you get it there and it's actually good
looking cooler considering it's a stock
one but I would recommend thing and a
i/o on there or a larger air core to get
yourself that extra overclocking
Headroom the CPU will reach about 3.8 to
3.9 gigahertz on air easily with even a
be 350 board most of these boards are
gonna overclock about the same I would
say 4x 370 maybe get another 100 200
megahertz if that I found in my
experience though that most boards are
within a hundred megahertz of each other
so because Verizon is a bit stubborn
when it comes to overclocking I would
say that for horizon 7 1700 get yourself
one of the cheaper X 370 boards just
because you're you know budget-conscious
if you're going for a 1700 versus
something like an 1800 X but if you're
gonna spend that much money on an 1800 X
which mind you is still a decent price
right now then go all out and get
yourself the best X
seventy bored you can buy I have that
info by the way linked in the video
description now this is interesting I
wasn't planning on discussing red ripper
much I don't feel like it pertains to a
majority of my viewing audience you guys
are mostly gamers and content creators
and even thread Ripper is overkill for
most of that 16 cores really and 300
bucks pretty pricey but it's still
considerably cheaper than what Intel
offers and the sky like X and kbx
platforms so if you're gonna get
something with that many cores maybe
you're a developer or some sort you
could use all the horsepower that these
cores can offer then this is an option
for you the 1950 X is right now on sale
for eight hundred dollars it's two
hundred dollars down from its regular
price the motherboards will cost you and
unfortunately I can't say much about the
stability of these boards because I
haven't actually tested it the record
for CPU but if you know that you need
the cores then this is where I would go
I just go with the full fledged 1950 X
right now it's probably not gonna be
much cheaper than that for the time
being go ahead and buy one now if you
like it I've link below in the
description along with a board
manufacturer that I personally trust now
went to end this video by thanking not
only AMD for sending out the CPUs for
I'll be in an unrelated video we'll get
to that soon but also MSI for sending to
tomahawk be 350 boards these boards are
actually pretty cheap I was surprised
you can get this board right now for
around eighty to ninety bucks really
nice link in the description you can
also get the black version if you think
that fits your color scheme better I
think this is one of the best value
boards just from an aesthetic standpoint
because I mean come on
white PCB right look there has never
been a better time to buy a rising CPU
nor a rising a motherboard I'm focusing
on AMD here because Intel is falling a
bit behind in the price competitiveness
category only because the locked intel
SKUs from coffee lake don't have the
accompanying boards we have Z 370 and
that's it so you buy a lock skew you
can't even use the unlocked chipset in
the Z board because the CPU is locked so
it's just kind of like what are they
doing like what why would why would you
even want to buy a lock to I 5 or a
locked I 7 and throw it into an unlocked
chipset board unless you could base
clock overclocked something like we
could do with skylight but as far as I'm
aware that's not possible right now so
in my opinion
AMD is the way to go in this season look
folks I just call it like I see it I've
been pretty critical of rising in the
past I've also been pretty critical of
the fanboys and the hypes or
pounding the platform I mean look I made
plenty of enemies on reddit okay but I'm
telling you right now the better value
is on the red team currently it's just a
it's a fact in my eyes I know you would
see it everyone looks at money
differently where value is but in my
opinion the value right now is on the
red team nothing's to stay there for
quite a while at least until Intel and
these these motherboard manufacturers
roll out something other than a Z 370
motherboards but you think is crippling
the non-case Q CPUs in the copy Lake
lineup if you liked this video be sure
to give this one a thumbs up thumbs down
for the opposite click that subscribe
button by the way if you haven't already
and that bail notification icon so that
you get notified when videos like these
go alive also check out all the links in

things are really take a turn down
financially after the holiday season is
up and January February it's it gets
pretty rough so help us out as much as
you can we'll appreciate it
stay tuned for the next video this is
