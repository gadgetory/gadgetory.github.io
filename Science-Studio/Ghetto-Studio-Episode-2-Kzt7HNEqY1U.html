weeks since the first episode of ghetto
studio and I was really impressed
actually with a turnout like 20k Bews
with respect to 400 K or so subs isn't
that huge of a turnout but I do think
that those who watched really enjoyed it
and they're gonna be regulars for this
kind of content and so that's perfectly
fine even if we stay at 20k for the rest
of this channels life for these kinds of
videos I'm perfectly okay with that we
have fun here and again this gives
people a chance to take some money that
that they've earned by not having a nice
set up to fix said setup and let me tell
you after you see these four entries I
really hope that whoever wins this
hundred bucks is gonna take this money
and make their setup look a lot nicer
than it currently does so what I want to
start off with first though is the
announcement for the episode one winner
and that went to entry number one now
again we're not gonna disclose
identities or names but that person
knows who he is and he has been
contacted you can see this is kind of a
section of the video that we showed for
the winner so I'm in contacted with him
we're gonna send him a hundred bucks fee
of PayPal today actually we're gonna
save the payment date for when we
actually air the next episode just so
that you guys are all aware of who won
assuming you don't follow me on Twitter
and I think that's how we're gonna do it
going forward so on to the four entries
we've got four again really good ones
here and we're just gonna jump on into
it so let's start with the first and you
guys this is this is some cringy stuff
by the way I've got headphones this time
around so I hopefully don't hear any
echo should all wow that sounded
terrible when I plugged it in gee I
think is the first number plugged a
headset in this laptop alright here we
go
get those two your giveaway take 38:13 q
okay this is my Wow that needs no
paintin
I'm sure he knows that already basket in
my punching bag in my guitar and my meme
hat and some stuff here a long time
still my wall of mirrors yeah you've
duct-taped your guitar if that's not
ghetto I don't know what is coming super
tape and yep that's exactly what I
expected to say but it's leap I took
myself from the corner right oh yeah so
well this is where I ate this is your
cleanup mostly right yeah I mind
oh and there's my mic guys very good my
chin wow that's uh it's broke every like
two or three times and I fix it okay
headphone good at pump this mixer don't
buy it
I'm Italian okay good advice fighting
stick retro
pretty good our exapilot some are x4 x5
74 212 evo and for these of res go away
that my other stick doesn't work and I
have to return it so to meet you Regina
have to return the two sticks so I have
to buy an artistic side my PC keeps on
and the ladies trailer it's like the
most sketchy way that hanging LEDs my
third one it's pretty cool yeah that's
innovative
yeah that's might get ups to do I just
heats alright dude that's great and look
he followed all the rules I'm impressed
with that I do think the audio was a
little on the poor side he had something
else playing in the background probably
would have muted that but I guess that
maybe adds to the ghetto atmosphere not
sure what you were going for there but I
do think you hit the nail on the head
this is exactly the kind of setup we're
looking for with these entries so good
on this guy and again he's gonna be
entry number one so when you go to vote
on Twitter via the link below which will
be live when you watch this video and
just click entry number one there's your
winner as simple as that we use Twitter
because it helps funnel traffic through
our social media sites but that's really
the extent of it so let's move on to
entry and number who so oh boy I didn't
do some pockets but I did have well
shoot both the fans blue round fans blue
it's good right it's a section check I
got a FX 4100 and then GT 614 I got one
of those laptop size five wives grams
over here and benefit of the thing the
wiring through a little hole I made
there it soon we couldn't fit the powers
of the why I'm last fan it was getting
kind of hot so I cut some vents right up
in here and right back there
you know PSU didn't fit so it's just
kind of hanging out back here behind the
whole little hole little setup I glued a
igloo to hub on years to make things a
little bit easier
my VGA is the only working port for some
students for my cheaper so that's beachy
so I had a hot glue that on there
because it was getting hot you know I've
had it for six years or so and it was
heating pretty bad so far my cooling
solution we had spent a serial
industrial stuff here well I should
probably be right yeah spend nine
dollars and got some ducting to tear it
just feed off how to get some very
stellar temps and it works fine does
gets the job done I can play the things
I play these awesome oh man alright so I
think this one's also a worthy contender
if you guys like entry number two again
you can check the Twitter poll you'll be
able to vote for him there by the link
in the video description and it'll take
you right to it
this one was innovative I especially
like the way that he you know he
emphasized the PC he didn't show us much
more emotion you've done a little more
of that that's kind of the whole point
here to show the whole studio not just
your ghetto PC but at the same time it
was innovative like I like how he stuck
the two and a half inch drive you know
between those two little cardboard slabs
because you don't want that drive move
answer that's a moving drive so that was
smart you know he duct-taped the AC unit
and basically just just ran something
down to his computer to keep things cool
and I would be definitely worried about
temps if I was running my computer out
of a shoebox so I think he again did a
great job
he was innovative and it was definitely
ghetto in my opinion moving on to entry
number three huh this is my mold mounts
of PC its Emerson motherboard 1gb ram
some some sort of hanging or did you
like just nail it into that wood who
read video a cub
I have dude something sounds like oh the
video just a lawnmower outside we're
playing together sit up together bravery
a tape whacking so wax still good are
you sure where I'm it's rosin right now
this is something I found one sided work
I expected nothing as is great I found
everything else here on the side of the
road including my house hey for any of
this these two kind of glad everything
here is pretty much I got for free every
was a nice cool gray handle this Ram
found graphics cards even kind of soos
one oh yeah I don't want to break those
do you be careful the actual site light
it does it fits in this one except is
motherboards broken it doesn't have a
very odd thing on a motherboard for
brains that doesn't work and make the
capacity of being somewhere so it's my
Hodesh this is what I love hungry 60s a
monitor Stan this is everything that's
great some mouse I got from a friend you
know it fits the bill um this is yeah I
got some of my tools over here go drill
they use for wall mounting that I
figured used to my god screwdrivers for
putting together to PC for I build in
working on this PC over here oh gosh
doesn't work IDE cables um or some
little screwdrivers over here know that
computer are just testing bench that I
moved over here because it was in the
way today yes that's it that's all of my
setup I figure I get three thank you for
watching this yeah
alright so this guy was a pretty
innovative you kind of made his own
makeshift workstation you know I had the
workbench he had his tools and stuff
definitely ghetto in my opinion so why
he made it into episode two and at the
same time like he's he's very
resourceful he's got a bunch of free
stuff that's what he's claiming and
I actually believe him because a lot of
stuff you probably couldn't sell even if
you tried but good on him because you
can still use that hardware especially
for some older applications so that's
awesome and that's another reason why I
selected him for the second episode of
get a studio so again if you want to
vote for entry number three you can do
so via the poll link below now on to our
last entry hey Greg this is two of my
room for the science student all right
yes little room tour with this one too
loves if it's a mini fridge you gotta
have that rage and just a extra yes it's
pretty messy irons yeah how do you even
open your interests or drawers papers
bunch of school stuff
what school do you go to and what you do
this part here this is my and my set of
monitors using those classic textbooks
and notebooks I like seeing that and the
specs I has 4 cores i7 6700 K G 16 gigs
10 8 and down here there's a bunch of
more computer parts your computer
salvaged from Craig's your system is it
that thing that they're leaning sleeker
bill that's your sleeper build this
Micah it means main desktop I built that
has a 1080 in it use parts off
Craigslist oh my gosh
I got a cheat x10 AT&amp;amp;T they're pretty
cheap it's literally a $400 oh that is
cringy these are old-school technics
speakers I hook up to a small portable
amplifier I'm just waiting for this guy
to show us more of his main system his
sleeper build he's gonna do it he's
gotta show us and much closer much
closer look at the desktop I can't
really see much from that Pinkle dude
you got so much crap in your room yeah
it's a very compact no it's a compact
room my plan is to eventually got
everything out and then put into that
Mac Pro case how about you gut your
whole room out make some more space for
yourself thanks for viewing maybe you
can show us a little more okay yeah and
I chose this person made it in episode 2
because I think he has a lot of
potential
if you just again takes the time to
clean up a little more and straighten
out his nice rig put it in a nicer case
gonna do is build justice because he
does have some pretty expensive parts in
there then it will be much less ghetto
nonetheless it is yet Oh in its current
state in my opinion and that's why I
selected him for episode 2 so that is
the fourth entry and if you want to vote
for this guy then you can do so by
clicking entry number four via the
Twitter poll in this video description
so that's a roundup of all four entries
again a excellent job to the four
entries in the previous episode I
thought they were all great we did have
a winner a very clear winner selected by
our Twitter audience and he has been
again notified he will receive his money
today actually I'm gonna pay him right
after we finished filming this one so
onto that I know he is awaiting for the
hundred bucks and best of luck to the
four entries this time around let me
know what you want to see in Episode
three and I'll do my best to pick four
contestants for the next episode that
fit your criteria in the comment section
below let me know we think about the
entire playlist and what again you hope
to see in the future this is science
studio thanks for cringing with us
