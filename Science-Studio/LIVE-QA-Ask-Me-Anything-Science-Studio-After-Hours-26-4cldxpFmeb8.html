this Sunday night or Monday morning on
Monday afternoon all my hair was that
just tuck that in yeah every one of bad
hair days just gonna wear a hat because
it's just too much of a mess to deal
with
so if I sound good let me know if I
don't sound good let me know I can
adjust things I want to do it up front
so that we don't have any complaints
midstream how are you all doing I
appreciate the compliment on the tank
thank you very much my necklace a little
messed up there we go yeah this is one
of those days where I'm starting to
clean up and stuff I got a pack because
we're actually moving to a different
apartment next week so that and the
power went out because there was a
really bad storm here lasted like two
and a half hours so I had today so it's
been one of those days or I'm just doing
busy work and that wasn't really in
front of the camera at all so yeah
that's also my phone look at this
I'm just so unprepared make sure there's
nothing important no it's not okay
uh so you guys read the title these live
streams are pretty much for you guys ask
questions whatever you want if I don't
know the answer again I'll do the
research I'll try my best to get back
next week when the answer or maybe
you'll give me an idea for a future
video and answered in that it really
just depends on how you know dense the
topic is by the way I'm moving at CES
somebody said Waldo said he's moving to
Miami I'm staying in in town here I'm
not I'm not moving to a different state
or anything like that I'm actually about
to finish my master's degree as well I
have one more week left and then I will
be totally finished with school
hopefully forever
I don't know i I've I've contemplated
just barely going after a PhD I just
don't think that I don't know I like
teaching it's kind of what I do here but
I'm not really into the whole like
university political thing I just I
don't know I think I've been in school
enough to know not to go back and stay
in it so I think I think we're fine here
and if this again like I said this
doesn't work out I have degrees to use
and it's why I have them
but yeah so that's the status of myself
this week Pepsi is chillin Pepsi's
chillin on the chair next to me I'm not
gonna bother she was sleeping the whole
time if if the livestream cuts out
randomly that's because she went behind
the desk and killed the power so yeah I
don't know I really do about that anyway
I see a lot of questions here we're
gonna get started on my scope just a
little bit let's see he Darrell Davis
says checking in from Seattle what's
going on there good to see in the live
stream Rio crafts asks is a 20 atti
worth it only for very very intense 4k
gaming I would say 4k high refresh rate
if you have a 4k 120 Hertz panel you
probably spent a lot of money on that
you're gonna want to complement that
with a really really beefy graphics card
a 22 TI right now is one of the only
cards out there a single card that can
handle you know the high Ultra presets
and some triple-a modern titles even
especially at a higher framerate so I'm
not really a big fan of cheering at this
point from what I've seen I do have a
couple touring cards in the studio I'm
gonna start benchmarking this soon but
just from a value perspective it's
really hard for me to recommend those so
we'll see you know I have a good idea
what they're gonna do because I've seen
other benchmarks on these exact cards
and I'm trying to be as open-minded as
possible but again I know a lot of you
are budget conscious and it's really
tough to recommend a car that's over a
thousand dollars that's given you maybe
at 30 percent sometimes upwards of 40%
bump in games most of the time you're
gonna use that horsepower unless you
again have a 4k high refresh rate panel
or maybe you're playing an 8k or
something like you have to 4k panels
there could be cases for that shor Swift
aileron kneebar the best content
creating tube hands down thanks to the
great content man I appreciate that
Swift thank you for the compliments
again thank you guys all for tuning in
whatever time it might be whatever day
it may be on the planet for you I
appreciate you guys taking the time just
to stop and even if it's for just a few
minutes it really doesn't mean a lot to
me that you guys care enough to watch
the live streams because I mean you guys
supply the content I really would have
nothing to talk about here if it wasn't
for the questions you had I could ramble
that something dumb but the questions
you guys asked her really good so yeah
let's see scrolling down I see goldenrod
what's going on Gold around those three
stars are looking good my dude mmm let's
see Kyle McCoy bulldozer architecture is
dead-on AMD I would say for the most
part yeah buying new bulldozer would
make no sense to me even though you can
still buy new FX 6300 and bulldozer and
piledriver we're gonna use those
interchangeably I think that
architecture he has pretty much dead on
the new side but you might be able to
get an FX 6300 and you know a decent a
decent board like a 970 board you could
probably get that combo for like 40
bucks
you know I'm pair that with a really
cheap graphics cartoon you got a really
nice budget oriented build so I don't
think that those CPUs are technically
dead I think they're dead on the new
market but in the use market they might
have you know they might have a chance
because people might just be giving them
away or selling them dirt cheap so like
you you know someone's loss is it can be
your gain if you're willing to jump on
those deals and you think that you can
flip them or use them you know
comfortably let's see scrolling down
Sanger mass please review gigabyte be
450ml whereas motherboard motherboard
reviews are kind of I've done a few of
them if motherboards have very specific
feature sets that set them apart from
their competition and sure I'll do them
but usually I mean you can tell what a
motherboard is gonna do what it's gonna
be like just based on the specs the the
feature sets on motherboard is pretty
straightforward the only really the only
thing that reviewers can really focus on
or are either one the BIOS or UEFI the
customizability there the layout
everything how easier to navigate set
things up and to overclock ability but
if it's be 450 you know people 50 you
can overclock that if it's on intel side
right lock chipsets like B and H series
chipsets those I mean you can't even
overclock with those so it really just
comes down to feature sets and that's it
I mean there aren't too many cases in
which the board doesn't have a great
power delivery system or it doesn't you
know if it doesn't support SLI or
crossfire you're gonna know because it's
not gonna be listed like those kinds of
things are pretty straightforward
so yeah motherboard reviews I might not
review that specific board but I know
that we'll be doing them in the future
just know that they're difficult to
really make dedicated videos on
because you can even tell mother port
scanadu what its gonna be like just
based on what is written on the box
again apart from those two variables we
talked about scrolling down here okay
next Adam asks I have an i5 eight 6400
gtx 960 four gig looking to upgrade i've
had that exact combo by the way in the
past in your opinion should i build a
whole new computer or just upgrade my GP
it's a good question
look I think the 6400 is still viable
that's going back to what the skylake so
skylake is still good I would say if you
even if you're on Haswell you're
probably still okay if you're on like an
i3 house wall or an i3 skylight that
might be grounds for an upgrade but I
think you could still probably stay
within that generation and be
comfortable moving up so if you're on an
i3 and it's not enough you noticing CP
bottlenecking scenarios then maybe go
for a used i7 like a 6700 or 6700 K in
your case Adam I would say unless you're
seeing specific cases in which the CPU
is the bottleneck and I have
bottlenecking videos how to tell which
is the bottleneck CPU because you're
always gonna have one bottleneck at
least you're gonna have a bottleneck
either on the CPU or GPU side depending
on the gay and the in-game settings the
resolution all that good jazz
it's just narrowing down which one is
more of the bottleneck under certain
scenarios and being able to kind of
gauge how big a bottleneck it actually
is so I would say 6400 is probably
pretty good still for a majority of
games some of the newer games are gonna
use more than those threads but the 960
is probably more of a bottleneck at this
point so I would check again do you do
diligence but just looking at it I would
say the 960 is probably what I would
want to upgrade first maybe a 1060 have
you really good upgrade you could even
buy a used 970 about a 970 for a hundred
bucks you know you could probably flip
it and break even almost just because
the old graphics cards are so cheap
let's see I need a new video card I'm
leaning towards our rx 580 or 1080 those
are two very different cards my friend
should I wait what should I get should I
go lower car than the 1080 I want an
asus strix card
I don't okay so
Harlem mania I gotta know what games you
want to play what resolution you didn't
give me enough details to answer that
question I mean you're better value
typically is going to be around the 580
territory gtx 1070 1080 start losing
tiny bit of value but if you're gonna
buy used then you can maximize value so
it really depends you didn't give me
enough info there to answer your
question properly
let's see scroll laying down here okay
every time i scroll down it skips over
everything okay let's see jose rodriguez
how much do you think i should pay for a
gtx 1080 TI fe and any info you can give
me i wouldn't pay any more than about
400 and between 4 and 450 for use 1080
TI that's a found resolution 1080 TI you
know they got some really beefy custom
adding boards for 1080 t eyes they're
gonna give you some really great
overclocks i'm i haven't tested a
founders edition 1080 TI before but i
just know that that's gonna be one of
the lower end car just because it is a
reference design so it might be limited
from a power or you know thermal
standpoint I would say 4 to 450 for that
I wouldn't pay any more than 450
especially if it was used and especially
if it seems as though the user before
you was mining with it Brandon ham
bright asked how are you doing tonight
Greg I'm doing alright Brandon like I
said earlier in the livestream I was
just packing and preparing for a move
and cleaning things up that's one big
cycle over and over and over every week
here scrolling down here
Martin tourney why are the new 20x
series cards so much money we haven't
even hit the tariffs yet a lot of that
I've already covered in my previous
videos Martin I invited to check this
out I also think that Nvidia is trying
to flush out Pascal supplies right now
so by kind of price gouging the market
themselves because they ultimately
control the high-end market they can
force consumers to buy the Pascal stuff
and that will flush out a lot of the
excess inventory that a Ivy's have had
to assume over the past few months on
account of basically an over speculation
with respect to the mining craze Nvidia
thought that a lot more people would be
buying cards the mining Cray start off
very quick just like it kind of sprung
up out of nowhere
and they forced a Ivy's to take on the
excess inventory that wasn't so
as a result we're left with Pascal cards
that are a lot cheaper than they used to
be and Turing cards that are extremely
expensive given the performance that
they offer so they're you know almost
kind of forcing people to sit by the
cheaper cards the past gen stuff and I
think another reason why they're doing
this another way to tell is because they
haven't released at 2070 yet 27 years
and it's gonna be a direct competitor
with a 1080 and right now the 1080 and
the 1070 are really cheap really
affordable so they're trying to flush
those out I really that's what they're
trying to do and then once they flush
them out then we'll see that the
twenty-seven-year-old out then we'll see
something lower than that you know it
really depends I don't even know if
we're gonna see touring architecture
with a 2060 or whatever it ends up being
hey you know I don't even know if those
cards are gonna be able to handle
ray-tracing DL SS whatever you wanna
call it I we might even see Volta back
into those I don't know I really don't
know I vote this is another case though
it doesn't really make sense to me so
but having our dedicated arti cores and
tensor cores in like a lower end like
2050 or 2060 whatever it ends up being
really doesn't make a lot of sense to me
we'll see I'm not I'm not sure yet okay
scrolling back up here cuz I missed a
couple questions I'm just a lot of
question you guys are asking a lot of
questions
Levi be are you still using the dell
sound bar on your monitor I am not I've
been been with you since the beginning
of your channel and it's even featuring
the background of some of your photos
yeah I used that a while back that was
actually something I took from my dad he
had an old surround sound Dell system
for one of his little desktops and I
took that when I first started the
channel and it was under my monitors
roll a long time but I've I've moved up
I have a clip surround sound kit my
parents actually got that for me for
Christmas last year and then I have I
have an Edifier set in the other room
and that's that's a Chinese brand but
it's like it's a good China if you know
speakers you know how to fire they're
really good speakers and I use those in
the film room so they're much you speak
assets
I love Clips though I have clips
surround sound set up
my living room - so clips is really good
bows they're all really fine
I've scrolling down oh okay
JJ squid 1080i or sli 1070 can I get
your opinion no I don't SLI if unless
you can get to ten seventy four a lot
cheaper than a single 1080 TI because
the performance there is very similar I
would say 1080i all the way
let's see boom-boom says so Greg what's
going on my dude uh let's see yeah Adam
Stephenson concurs 1080 I wouldn't
recommend SLI yeah if you can avoid SLI
Shore I would I would go for the single
core config SLI is something that games
will mostly support nowadays but it's
not a guarantee and even so you're still
going to have stutter issues I had those
issues with pub G I still do when I play
that game all the time so it bugs me
scrolling down truck every time I just
barely scrolled down it skips over so
many questions I hate that okay let's
see tech tuner life is funny how people
are still asking 650 bucks for use gtx
980ti so well tell me about it i was
looking on ebay yesterday I've been
buying mainly Tennant 10 seventies 92t
is about a 970 just cuz I got a really
cheap and those are usually between 2
and 300 bucks
the 1070 since n 80s the 1080 T eyes
I've noticed they're selling between
four and five hundred bucks you know
that's a liberal estimation but some
people are still trying you know they
have a Buy It Now option they're not
putting it up for a bid they're just
doing the Buy It Now thing and when you
buy it now you don't get the unless they
enable it you can't submit an all you
can't make an offer you have to just buy
it or it's done and what's even funnier
save like a time limit so the time limit
you know if it expires and nobody buys
it that's got to be like that Q to them
oh I priced it too high he's nobody was
interested I just I don't know I think
they're waiting for suckers to buy these
like there's nothing wrong with uh
something illegal about doing that but
if you know anything of my graphics
cards in the current used market you
should not spend that much on a 1080 CI
that's we can get the board new so it
makes no sense to buy used for the same
price cabassa let's see science to do
you have you seen that Corsair RM 550 X
deal 52
dollars at Newegg I haven't seen it yet
but I'm sure people are gonna see it now
scrolling down Vincent in 11:05 can you
give me some tips for a beginner like me
I'm building their own PC because I'm
looking forward to building PC soon I
don't know I don't want to screw
anything up Vincent my whole channel is
like dedicated to building pcs do so go
back and watch some videos on the
channel how to build PC there's like 20
of them on our channel alone
there's plenty elsewhere so yeah I mean
that's that's why those videos exist
they're there to help you ok let's see
scrolling down snow x core what Nvidia
cost-effective GP for gaming do you
recommend if you've got to buy it new on
Amazon cost-effective I mean this I
would say the best value right now if
you can get rx 570 or rx 584 Giga a gig
really it's not gonna matter with those
cards I wouldn't get a 1063 gig you're
gonna be limited there a lot of games
use over three gigs but less than four
gigs kind of a weird thing with 1080p in
1440p excuse me um let's see the 1060 is
about as high as that would go 1070
maybe but if you're looking for best
value and you want to buy an Amazon
that's what you're gonna be stuck with
you could get 10 70s and 10 80s for
cheaper than brand new 1060 s you just
got to be willing to buy used which is
why I've been promoting it so much look
if the thing doesn't work when you buy
it
file an eBay claim return it you'll get
your money back I mean nine point nine
times out of ten you know there's very
very minimal risk I bought like eight
graphics cards the last two weeks from
eBay and all of them work ok and if none
of them you know if one of them didn't I
would have no issue filing a claim and
waiting to get my money back I've never
had that big of an issue with eBay
there's always that horror story again
in the comment section whoa
eBay screwed me over well ok you know
I'm sorry dude but that's not the norm
is what I want to you know get across to
most people who are afraid to jump into
the used market let's see we had a super
chat up here I'm gonna get that to
advocate to that jello is that has what
you say a jello a book a bouquet good
lord I butchered that that's 125
Filipino something I don't know what
that is in US but thank you for that
I appreciate the super chat hey Greg do
you still think it's
good idea to make a tech channel now on
YouTube look I've said from the
beginning I think right when when our
channel started getting bigger that was
when a lot of tech channels took like
just started popping up out of nowhere
the competition is ferocious it's still
a thing queer on the upper edge of the
wave of like new tech tubers so we kind
of got in at just the right time if we
had waited maybe another year I think
we've gotten shafted and that just has
to do with the fact that you know
YouTube's algorithm sees the sub counts
the view counts the engagements and we
have an advantage over those channels
that started maybe a year or two ago
because we've had more time to grow a
fanbase and with so many channels now in
the space it's a lot harder to grow and
set yourself apart so if you're gonna do
it I suggest me as unique as possible
take a very unique approach to reviewing
tech or doing whatever you gonna do with
it and yeah I would take that home
honestly it's it's tough it really is
tough to set yourself apart do something
different you know be you got to be
different
let's see Swift aileron do you enjoy
four-night absolutely not I hate for
tonight okay scrolling down but Charles
says watch out for shipping fees added
on those bids too I mean usually the
shipping fees display - right under the
price so it's not really a mystery and
usually it's only like 10 or 20 bucks
make sure you're buying within the state
or country I would say within the
country that you live you don't want a
bid on something that is like in Japan
that would suck cuz then it would take
forever to get here and it would
probably be pretty expensive to ship it
okay let's see try on juggernaut can you
use nvme and dot - as your only storage
sure I'm doing that actually in one of
my other builds it's not something that
I'm worried about stockpile a lot of
games on or a lot of media it's it's
more or less just for data crunching
stuff like that and an MDOT - is fine as
long as it's a at least I would say 250
gig or so and go down to like 128 that's
that's really small and your operating
systems gonna take up half of that
storage ok scrolling down here lemon a
here's a question my PC shut down when
the mother motherboard logo came up as
the current went off now the PC starts
but no display everything turns on but
no display that's weird I don't know
what PC you have maybe try plugging your
display cable directly in your
motherboard assuming you have an IG PU
if you don't then swap the graphics card
if you don't have a second graphics card
take it into a shop and see if they'll
let you try one of their cards just to
troubleshoot it I might have a dead
board might have a dead card but it's
probably one of the two okay scrolling
down scrolling the UM
let's see this is these are those like
super fast sessions you know I'm just
like chugging through questions I'm
trying to keep them trying to keep them
you know filled with information or as
much as possible I can't dive into one
subject the entire live stream of that
would be unfair all the other people
asking questions and I love seeing all
these questions in here so thank you
fold that okay Brandon ng best GP 4i 340
170 I wouldn't go any higher than a 1050
TI 1060 I wouldn't go any higher than
that
um so stay within that range maybe even
lower than that I paired my i3 4150 with
750 Ti and I was a pretty good balance
so there you go
let's see
Boston Tech's reasonably priced ATX case
with USBC on the front I Oh
off the top of my head yeah I can't I'm
trying to think
the fractal define r6 has USB type-c I
mean I know what you think is reasonably
priced that's around 100 bucks or so if
you're that worried about USB type-c I
mean there still aren't many options in
affordable cases and you probably won't
see that for a while just because the
cable of the case I mean the cable
itself having to run that cable from the
front that thing is pretty expensive
that cuts in the margin of the case
manufacturers so you know every other
feature that they add cuts into that
margin and that's why the cheaper case
is almost always foregoing so it's a
trade off depends on how much you want
to spend mmm see scroll down JJ's squid
1080p or 1440p monitor I think 1440
piece of sweet spot for a lot of people
especially in the 27-inch form factor I
wouldn't go any higher than about 24
inches for 1080p okay
but someone asked what's the best gaming
router for in general and gaming router
I gaming routers I mean to be honest
like a routers a router it's gonna do
whatever Howard has you could buy a
totally hardcore industrial router and
that's gonna be a great gaming router so
I would say anything that supports that
it's able to support the bandwidth that
you have coming in you're gonna be fine
with look I use Google home and Google
home is like not a gaming router at all
but I have everything wired in from a
switch so I run one Ethernet cable from
the router but that's my modem right
there the Google home is above that over
it's a little further backwards a little
further that way there we go
but then I haven't eaten that cable
running or on there along the wall and
then back to a switch they have here and
the switch splits more internets to the
other two pcs on this desk so that's how
I do it you don't need a gaming router
it's just a marketing - for the most
part so with aileron thank for that one
and a super chat my dude amazing contact
key with a good work Thank You Swift for
tuning in
let's see scrolling to Dante Jay are you
married yes I am married
let's see scrolling down here okay
carick set our question is it possible
to pick up a CPU cooler today for the
upcoming I 9 CPU or wait for reviews so
you're probably talking about socket
compatibility right so the if we're just
going off a precedent here I'm pretty
sure that the I nines are still going to
use the same style socket
unless I'm just I don't know I haven't
been looking it up recently but I'm
pretty sure that the socket design is
gonna be the same it might even be the
same socket I'm not totally sure they
keep refreshing the same crap every year
so don't expect too big a difference I
think you'll be ok but don't quote me on
it if you like if you need one just just
I mean you don't need one now you don't
have the system now just wait there's no
point buying that cooler early unless
it's like a really good deal I would
just I would just wait didn't make any
sense to buy early let's see
VJ said please stop by an RX 470 doesn't
stay stable its default overclocked
settings please help me I can't test it
I can't I mean
you didn't give me enough info I can't
test it because I'm not there obviously
I need more data than that it's gonna
take a lot of time and I can't really do
that in a live stream and Vijay I'm
sorry if it's running stock like that
unstable then it's probably not caught I
mean it's probably a hardware issue with
the card I wouldn't say it's it's just a
salt I wouldn't say it's software issue
you might wanna get that rm8 okay I saw
another good question let's see oh gosh
I skipped so much money this okay keke
bro what's a simple way to avoid ESD
when building a PC I don't even
okay so ESD it's electrostatic discharge
I don't use anything when I build AI I
literally build on carpet and I've never
had an issue with ESD and the reason why
I think I haven't is because I'll in a
humid environment if you live in the
desert and you also have carpet and is
really hot in your house then you might
have a problem with ESD seems to wear an
electric you know anti-static wristband
something along those lines I think it's
a little overkill it's it's just most of
the time even if you have some sort of
ESD some because of contact for the
graphics card it's not going to kill it
and that's been tried many times so it's
it's something that I think people blow
way out of proportion I remember people
freaked out when I was using a magnetic
screwdriver to screw in screws on a
motherboard and they were freaking out
oh you can afraid components you're
gonna zap the inductors with the
magnetic fuel to that screwdriver like
it's a bunch of crap like nobody knows
what the heck they're talking about like
that makes no sense at all and magnetic
fields on those things are extremely
weak by comparison you would need a
magnet the size of a CD player to get it
to do anything like that like they're
describing so anyway yeah there's a lot
of BS being spread around I think that
ESD is one of those things that's kind
of taboo it takes a lot of takes a lot
of static build-up to actually kill
something most of the time but if you're
not worried about it
you know anti-static wristband is the
thing that people always use okay rent
over ah let's see Stephen double og row
do you think we the customers will end
up paying the price for the new tariff I
really don't know I think the tariff is
another one of those things that we're
not really gonna know until we see it I
think people are freaking out hardcore
because of all these news articles about
oh these prices for this and this just
went up look trade war suck for
everybody but
I really think that at the end of the
day the price increases on account of
tariffs alone from cards that are being
shipped in from Taiwan and China are not
going to be all that substantial I might
be totally wrong I hope I'm not but I
think this is something again that's
just being scrutinized with um you know
a magnifying glass a microscope because
people just like to blow things out of
proportion I don't know I it's just
another thing again that we're gonna
have to wait and see about we've seen
prices already indirectly go up because
of this but to what extent we really
don't know this isn't the end of it so
we'll see just just my take on it
scrolling down here okay Joseph can oh
hey Greg what do you think about protons
steam beta for Linux dude I don't touch
Linux I have no idea how to answer that
question
laughing cheese maybe if it matters
maybe it matters if you're on a Wi-Fi
well okay laughing cheese it's gaming
has the fact that it's a gaming router
does not inherently make your Wi-Fi any
better gaming routers are called gaming
routers because typically they can
handle high bandwidth streams and their
signals are really strong you know and
but that's if you get a good router it's
gonna have a strong signal it's gonna be
it's gonna be able to handle gigabit you
know internet it's it's gonna be able to
do all those things anyway like I said
gaming routers are marketing hype that's
what they are unless it has some weird
gaming function I'm not aware of
it's just hype for gamers to want to go
buy that router in question okay it's
this it's like that with anything I mean
anything you want to sell you just
tailor it to that audience that you're
trying to target by calling it something
that sounds really special we learned
about that long ago in marketing class
okay let's see yes CNS VG says my gaming
router is an Asus AC 1300 it was slow
then I took us off and it's better oh
and it's better now yeah
few things that you might want to change
with that but we have coalition gaming
and I'm sorry I'm looking at Super
Chester's came in
let's see scrolling down to do squid I
see you against at chats blowing it
what are your thoughts on okay
okay I just skipped a lot of crap I got
a scrub I got oh gosh okay here we go
I think I'm adding a bit now John bread
yo does your mate bug ex-pro have high
pitch fan noise when your laptop goes
under load any laptop really is gonna
have some high-pitched fan noise it's
not gonna go it's not gonna disappear
mine it's a little loud but it's not
unknowingly loud my MacBook gets as loud
as the maple ik x pro so I mine's fine
if yours is making some really weird
squealing noise it's probably a defect
and I would get that are made actually
funbucket own I think of that $7.99 all
see hey Greg I have a define r6 and I
use the build in vertical GPU just
wondering what the temp differences are
for the CM vertical bracket versus built
in all right that's a good question and
I talked up this in a few videos the
coolermaster bracket it's gonna require
you to cut your case that's what sucks
most cases have those little little
brackets that run down the PCIe lanes
with the PCIe slots and that sucks
because you're going to cut those for
the cool master bracket but with respect
to temperatures big difference because
the the define r6 has those two extra
slots put pushing just against that
glass in fact some graphics cards even
to slow graphics cards won't even fit
there because they're so close to the
glass and the shrouds are usually
thicker than two slots so using the
cooler master brackets gonna push that
card a lot further back towards the
motherboard that's gonna give you about
four or so inches of space between the
the glass and the shroud and the fans
only on the graphics card cooler that's
gonna make that's gonna be a night and
day difference so if you got concerned
about temps sure if the temps are still
okay comfortable ish then just leave it
the way it is but I would say you know
if you're worried about temps at all the
cooler master brackets a lot better also
we're gonna start talking about the
cable mod bracket here soon
cables company k1 what's coming out with
that canna they they had it before they
had to make a few changes and they're
gonna release it again and that doesn't
require you to cut in your case at all
which is really exciting so we'll see
but I'm pretty hyped about that because
I love turning card sideways I just
think that that looks so much better in
my opinion good question though
okay let's see someone asks is Asus be
360 tough gaming Pro a good motherboard
I'm sure I lied like ASUS motherboards I
like them a lot I don't really have
problems with AC sports in general and
the Tough Series is a good series
how bad is will in a pub G Ryan high
well is pretty trash but I think the
real reason why wills trash is because
he streams over g-force now on his
MacBook so he's a limited both in terms
of hardware and software it's really
funny okay so lean damn okay
scroll down scroll and oh I see a
question about okay okay
coalition gaming $2.00 super chat thank
you my dude small channel reviews vid
soon he keeps asking about it I'm gonna
get to it I keep delaying it I'm sorry
that I keep having to tell you that but
a lot of stuff goes on a lot of product
reviews and videos that I have to get
out of certain times we have contracts
with sponsors and stuff and it is just
you know it's tough
plus I'm moving now if you can make it
even worse but I'll get to it I promise
it's not going anywhere it will show up
soon
ramen boy how can I convince my console
peasant friend to switch to gaming PC
here's the best way to do they get a
high refresh rate monitor make sure your
PC's decent you can utilize a higher
framerate that's usually the biggest
difference nobody's gonna understand the
difference between 60 fps and 120 fps
until you have them sit down and play a
first-person shooter or something along
those lines that will convince them that
it is that much better than a typical
console okay and I can attest this
firsthand because I play consoles all
growing up I started the PlayStation 1
even intend to 64 and I went all the way
through up to the Xbox one the one and
the Xbox one X so yeah that's that's
what I would do if you wanted to
convince them let's see Cheree pop P ow
Oh game real exes video on the tariff 10
to 20 percent it's been a year on a
crazy amount of easy opponents yeah I
mean we'll see I don't know 10 to 25%
that's obviously that's a really big
margin 10 to 20 represents not specific
at all and it really depends on the
component it depends on where it's
coming from
we'll see I know it'll affect things I
don't know how severe Lee's gonna
things I don't know how long it's gonna
last so we'll see and this is something
that again you know I would have to do
more research on obviously they've done
that but I'll probably make a video on
it once I get enough info in regarding
manufacturers and suppliers on both
sides of the issue
let's see Yolo Yolo what laptop under
1,100 for casual gaming and video
editing poof you want to play a casual
game GTA 5 is not casual gaming that's
it that's that game is not something
that you just play lightly a video video
editing also if possible good battery
life as well it's tough good battery
life on a gaming laptop is like it's
impossible
ok Brian this is not a wife beater this
is a tank top wife beaters look
different wife beaters like you know I'm
saying that they're tighter they like
they're more form-fitting and you know
anyway anyway whatever whatever maybe
they're maybe they're all wife beaters
or some people but this is not a wife
beater to me it's not when I bought this
I was like oh that's a cool tank top I
didn't think oh this is a cool wife
beater like first up that's a really
weird term for a tank top like this but
ok I'll let you have that one I'll let
you have that one Brian thank you I'll
take this as a compliment by the way
let's see scrolling down here oh this is
a good one dolphin i'ts
what are some good RGB coolers for Raisa
specifically a 2600 or 2600 X good I
mean really good RGB coolers I really
like the h7 quad Lumi the gamm xgt from
deep cools a really good one already be
coolers I mean go a iOS if you want even
the stock coolers on the 2600 X let's
talk low in 2600 X is really cool I'm
using out right now on this system and I
figure what it's call not the present
the prism is the biggest one but
whatever the one underneath that is yes
I'm talking about that one has a really
cool LED glow around it so yeah I don't
even know if you need an aftermarket
cooler we'll see here
ok let's see will says I hate when my
shroud is too thick well oh that's so
good well oh my gosh by the way if you
guys haven't
we're gonna be playing pub G after this
and the discord server so if you haven't
joined the public discord I fight you to
do that now we share that with Brian
over at IKEA city and the discord is
called cyan CS city because we like to
be boss and we're tag-team in it and
it's a really good community so if you
haven't joined it do that porfavor okay
let's see martin tourney are you able to
video chat with lisa does she view your
live streams so when we do these live
stream usually she's sleeping she does
in germany so that's a seven-hour
difference and that would make her time
right now 9 + 7 16 4:35 she's not awake
at 4:35 my circumstances so she doesn't
get to see these live usually she goes
back and watches them she watches all my
videos and I love I love that she does
that but yeah we get to video chat all
the time we chat at least once a day and
for quite a while usually unless we both
are crammed with work or whatever yeah
so it sucks having to do that that's
really all we get but yeah see Judea Jew
Jew Jew doy Qi Dan 76 he says
wife-beater is white and it's a ribbed
this is clearly not ribbed Brian this is
one of those like cotton whatever
they're polyester I don't know I don't
know what this is but you know what I
mean it's not ribbed like a wife beater
anyway they're rough you look to go with
oh gosh I need a shave now let's see
mark I'm wearing a black wife beater
not that it sounds any better but it
sure is comfy oh my god I just don't
know I guess that's just a joke I don't
think they're actually they're not
actually called a wife beater so just
that's just like something that people
have associated with the kinds of people
who beat up their wives I don't know
it's just kind of a dark story behind
why it's called that anyway yeah that's
a good that's a good way to compare it I
like I like this I missed escrow hate
these girls down yeah
Kevin Dyer says wife beaters are
underwear right so you wear those
undershirts and stuff they're like there
are literally under shirts or under tank
tops because they're form-fitting and
then tank tops are not you don't wear
tank tops under other shirts
unless you're weird
ah let's see um scrolling damn Azam Lord
is 230 a good price for a 1060 right now
depends on the 1060 depends if you're
buying it you new or used I can get a
1070 for less than 230 bucks if you if
you want to buy it used you can get way
better on the used market so just take
that will dare what is your favorite PSU
I really like the EVGA p2 Series I also
like the be quiet dark Power Pro Series
dark power Pro 11 and the straight power
straight power 10 I think is where this
straight power a pretty shirt straight
power 10 a straight power load yeah I
like those a lot be quiet a VGA power
supplies are my favorite anything really
from C sonic or FSP those are those are
my probably two favorite manufacturers
let's see toes 5 euro thank you my dude
I appreciate the super chat water-cooled
build considering a 360 ml with 45 thick
rad plus 240 with 30 mile thick rads on
an 8700 k and 1080i what reservoir size
should I use look going with a small res
is difficult not only from like a here's
the process with us with a small small
rest you're gonna fill that thing up
assuming it's higher in your system
which it should be because if it's not
then you're gonna have air bubbles and
stuff at the top and it can be difficult
to get out if you're using like I let's
say a 120 mil compatible radiator a
reservoir which is gonna be about that
big you're gonna have to fill that thing
up all the way then you have to turn the
pump on right and that pumps gonna
circulate the fluid you're gonna have
air bubbles still everywhere then you
have to fill it up again turn the pump
on again let it cycle more then go fill
it up again then turn it on again let it
cycle more and then you're gonna get to
the point where you can finally start
adding fluid with the pump on
continuously and you're gonna be able to
fill it all up get the air bubbles out
all negative 240 ml or a 360 mil ish and
then they have like 200 it really
depends but I'm talking about height
here assuming you have like an inch and
a half ish diameter I would say we're
not inch and a half I'd be about what
two inches or so I would say that a 240
mil radiator radiator radiator a 240 ml
compatible reservoir something that's
maybe this big those are my favorite
ones because they're not too big they
don't take up too much space and they
usually fit in most cases or a
three-sixty mill reservoir those are
going to be preferable they're just
easier unless you're going with an ITX
case in which case you're gonna really
have no choice more than likely gonna go
with a 120 ml compatible reservoir so
that's my take on that thank you again
for that super chat Mon dude I
appreciate it
okay scrolling down Chips Ahoy when was
the last time you cringed it's someone
who had an old graphics card I'm not
really cringe I mean people are in there
in the situations that they're in either
they don't see the utility and getting a
more expensive card or they can't afford
one I mean there's a lot of different
scenarios I don't I'm not gonna cringe
over somebody not being able to afford
something I mean that's that's
distasteful and wrong ethically and I
was in that position for a long I
couldn't afford anything more than 750
Ti when I finally built my first
official PC with my own money that was
what I could afford so like that's all
completely relative and I think I mean
if I'm gonna cringe it's somebody for
the way that their graphics card looks
or whatever I'm only gonna cringe at it
if it's like a really dusty and they
just haven't cared take care of it maybe
they have ugly you know supplemental
power cables just nested everywhere
because they don't have a cable manage
or whatever they don't care - that would
be something more cringe more than
anything and that's why I usually make
such a big deal over cable management
because that is something you can
personally change and it costs you zero
dollars and zero cents so yeah okay but
but but let's see let's see mister
couple questions okay Stephenson he was
able to find some tank tops and even
yeah uh let's see not Owen not dish 1080
for 350 it's not bad I got a 1080 for
300 so that's gonna be my mark from now
on if I can get something around 300
bucks in that price in that caliber I'm
gonna say that's probably a little high
but it's fine not too bad I think very
few instances in which you're gonna be
able to get a 1080 for 300 bucks so it's
not too bad I wouldn't go any higher
than that though let's see
buh-buh-buh-buh scrolling down
any good question thanks laughing cheese
I appreciate it it's a great answer
Noor char Greg seen some interesting
water cooling part on Aliexpress and
other vendors what about you build the
most affordable and cheapest water
cooling rig using that kind of part full
loop for $300 I've seen other tech
tubers do that before I'm gonna say yeah
I mean I just don't really see the point
if you're gonna build a custom loop
you're probably gonna want to spend some
money on the good stuff just to me
that's an enthusiast thing already to
begin with and if you're not wanting to
do a custom loop then you can just buy a
iOS and get the same job done so I don't
know it kind of defeats the purpose
that's like buying like it's like buying
a really expensive engine like a you
know a Ferrari or Lamborghini engine to
put in like a really cheap Toyota Camry
or something like to me if you're gonna
go all out and you want the horsepower
you might as well get the whole package
and to me buying the most expensive but
but the stuff that's more expensive from
ek hear from alpha cool or whoever to me
that's gonna be more worth it because
you're gonna get reliable components
aren't going to break midway through and
think about it your system it's gonna
have water whatever pumping through it
you don't want any of that stuff to
split to crack or break in the middle of
gaming or whatever you're doing because
that's gonna be catastrophic for your
system so okay I'm scrolling down a
little more oh gosh mmm okay Coe FAFSA
any idea why be quite power supplies are
so expensive do they offer something
unique I mean the fan usually the be
quiet power supplies have selling
weeks.3 fans those are really expensive
fans but they're really quiet think
about it like nokju I made a power
supply this would be the same comparison
here because notch was known for making
very quiet fans as well so you're paying
a little premium for the fan for how
because they are really quiet don't get
me wrong there are some of the quietest
power supplies I've ever use and that's
why I like them so much but yeah they
are on the expensive side you are
getting that silent factor you're also
getting reliability they use FSP I
believe for a lot of their newer power
supplies FS PC
good brand not the best I would say see
sonic is better than FSP but great
warranties on those power supplies and I
haven't had an issue to date so we'll
see scrolling down here who talking
nonstop for an hour I tell you it sounds
easy but it's really difficult I'm
throat like my throat is parched right
now I feel like I haven't drunk water in
three hours which is actually true I
should have brought a water bottle in
here that's the red chicken Bob should I
buy NZXT liquid cooling or Corsair
liquid cooling they're really gonna be
the same unless you buy a really really
pricey Corsair cooler with a slightly
different pump in it they're mainly
gonna use the same pump the ASA tech
pump so they're all gonna perform about
the same really just comes down to
aesthetics at that point so you just
pick the one that you think it looks
better in the form factor that you're
interested in
oh gosh okay here what a G 5,400 and rx
560 be a good match oh yeah okay match I
mean I'm gonna be too bad it's it's
again it's you're gonna have in just
Susan which of both they're gonna be
your bottle Mike really depends on the
game but in general it's not too
unbalanced okay let's see hey science
studio where did you get the 1080 for
300 a Bay yeah all my graphics cards
used or bought from eBay okay let's see
Kiki bro forget that it popped off and
won't stay on are you talking about
adhesive tape DS and plastic strategies
think of a quad Lumi that's your shout
you think oh yeah I would say yeah I
would say you're cool isn't gonna get
that hot double-sided tape should be
fine some kind of like 3m tape or
something
Kameron be a spot well my real name is
my real name is Greg Salazar so a stick
pump should be fine yeah a suit a pump
is mainstream a Sutekh pumps aren't very
strong relatively speaking and that's
one of the reasons why that cooling
potential is not really as good as in
the custom loop but they're there like I
said they're conventional they're easy
to replace usually covered under
warranties and you know you can get them
much cheaper than you can a full custom
loop
jolly alley Bali our old Zeon's worth it
that my friend is a question for Brian I
have a good feeling he's gonna tell you
yes they're worth it
alexander perez gtx 770 still nice it's
good it's kind of nice I'm pretty sure
the 770 was similar to the nine-nine 69
50 it's okay for 1080p it's okay I
wouldn't push 4k with that or high-end
1440p you're gonna have a you're gonna
have a difficult time in 1440p with
modern games with that card but 1080p
shouldn't be too bad
let's see but I'm seeing the question
I'm at the very bottom of the questions
now so anything you guys type I'm seeing
like real-time it's just at the very
bottom so whatever comes in let's see
GUI Cossack I think that's his name hey
Greg I have 110 70 should I buy 2nd 10
17s allow them or sell it and get 110 80
the jump from a 1070 to 1080 isn't that
incredible you would benefit more than
likely more from dual 10 70s but if you
want to sell the 10 70 get a 1080 I
would question what you're doing with
those cards anyway you're gonna be fine
with either one really you're not going
to see a huge jump in performance
between the two
you know gddr5 versus gddr5 X there's
gonna be a little bit of a bandwidth
bottleneck in the other side but it's
not going to be noticeable the bandwidth
usually isn't the bottleneck to begin
with so I would just stick with a 1070
dude I mean like if you want to go up to
110 80 then you probably don't need an
upgrade in the first place you're just
finding the excuse to spend money I
would save that money and just just wait
buy something you know different
laughing cheese asks is a ten seventy
ten ceviche okay for 1440p 144 Hertz yep
I use that actually my personal rate ten
seventy I 144 Hertz or 165 Hertz same
thing 1440p and I can pretty much hit
high very high settings in-game so yep
okay I see Chris asked question hey Greg
I wanted to add some RGB to my rig but I
don't really want to swap out for RGB
components wood strips work what would
be the best way to sync them if possible
okay yeah strips are the best way to do
that just line a strip on the top you're
gonna have a controller and you can sync
them all up because you can connect
multiple strips together usually
that's how I would do it let's see Tyler
McManus or if you've been asked as
multiple times so why did you go back to
science to do from Salazar studio I kind
of the same reason why I switched to
Salazar studio because I was originally
called science studio but I was called
that for a different reason
I was called science 2d because we
didn't just cover tech we covered
everything related to science I switch
to the cellar studio because I thought
we were gonna do more than just tech but
not necessarily focused on science
because that wasn't right why you guys
subscribed and you guys really liked our
vlogs and stuff like that so I wasn't
sure about that the future of the
channel in that sense but I changed it
back to science to do to kind of pay
homage to the originality of the channel
and the stuff that we were doing in the
beginning because I eventually imagined
we're gonna be doing that stuff again so
we'll see you now but we'll always do
the tech stuff this is why most of you
subscribed in the first place
protecting my best Greg cheesecake of
chocolate cake dude cheesecake
all frickin way strawberry cheesecake is
the best way to go I tell you what you
eat one piece of chocolate cake you feel
like crap feel like dog crap but you eat
one piece of cheesecake you feel good
that's how cheesecakes supposed to make
you feel so that's how that's how I
always make my decision which one's
gonna make me feel less bad at the end
of it that's what I do cheesecake for
some people can't handle cheesecake it's
too too thick too rich but to me
chocolate cake is worse oh let's see
okay what trade animations which is
worse to drink sulfuric acid or bleach
both I mean your stomach is your stomach
is acidic so drinking a base that's that
basic would have a really bad effect on
your stomach's balance chemical balance
but sulfuric acid is gonna eat through
your esophagus and everything else so
they're both bad I mean at least you can
do the same thing people think that like
acid is like the one thing that's really
bad but bleach is the same super basic
things are also very very harmful and
caustic so yeah but ba let's see
coalition gaming going to CES of course
my dude mark says the man knows his cake
that's what's up dude what is cheese pie
REMIC says cheese pie is better what the
heck is that crap oh yeah I mean I heard
her cheese pie that sounds disgusting
I mean she's itself ain't too bad but
like cheese pie I don't like it that
much
connor w hi Greg I'm going to the
graphic design also casual gamer looking
to build looking at a new monitor
interested in the Acer x34 predator
what does be a wise purchase I don't
know Connor I've never I've never used
it I've never I've never reviewed it so
I can't give you a first-person account
you know if I if I had used it I
would've never review on it but I don't
have her view on the channel so I can't
really answer your question but Acer in
general is gonna be a good brand Acer LG
Asus even Samsung thank you and pixie
are really good brands in my experience
like pixie was a really good value
proposition for something you might get
comparably from asus or whatever asus is
just a more household name by this point
BD hi Greg love your content with having
one SSD partition partition OS and
stream Steam games affect the speed of
load times too much I don't think so
no I mean what do you mean by part so
you're talking about a partition just
free OS and then a partition for stream
games are you talking about a partition
for both because it's not really gonna
make much of a difference at all you can
like when I format SSDs and use those
and clean builds I just use the same
partition for everything I don't I don't
separate it because to me there's really
no point unless I'm gonna reuse the same
drive over and over in other systems
I just keep hard drives for Steam games
so that's how I get around that but yeah
you're not gonna see too big a
difference at all
Tristen any clue why mystic light only
controls one stick of g.skill Ram when I
have to installed
that's not normal shouldn't be the case
that's I don't know why it's doing that
mystic light here I can control all the
sticks of RAM so that sounds like a
motherboard issue or software issue it
could be either one Michael XF asked
what happened answering questions do you
have been doing it the entire time were
you talking about my clean pay attention
bro
razor blade Verizon 1600 verse 2600 for
streaming
with one with one with ten 50 TI there
that I mean they're gonna be almost the
same there's really not much of a
difference the only difference is the
2600 gonna give you a little better
overclock 6 + P profile stuff like that
we've covered that in videos I invite
you to watch those videos razor ok let's
hear scrolling Brown boy 37 Greg do all
monitors support base amounts no they do
not a lot of them don't and you need to
be careful because if you want to mount
them on to third-party stands and
they're not based on mountable you're
just unless you jerry-rigged it somehow
you aren't gonna be able to use the base
amount so yeah it's a good question but
yeah most of them are not I would say
most of them aren't but a lot of them
aren't ok Ryan asks hey Greg how many
entries do you have for ghetto studio
tour thus far I'm actually curious let's
see how many entries forget a studio we
have
I wanna know I wanna know what love is
ghetto studio and trees at gmail.com
right that was the email okay and so
yeah we feel like two emails wow we have
a lot
looks like we have 24 unread emails 23
get a studio entry get a studio entry
yeah so we've got 23 entries and to get
a studio so far which means that if you
divide that by what six so there's you
have a one in six shot of being included
in the final four for next week's get a
studio episode which means that you'll
then have so what one in six shot times
one in four you have a one out of 23
chance of winnin that was obvious
because there were only 23 entries
anyway yeah so the pools not too hot
right now which is good for those who
entered if you haven't entered already I
invite you to do so all the rules
details all that are listed in the
latest video that we published so check
that out if you haven't already but this
is good I'm glad I was hoping we didn't
have like three or four entries because
I know what have been like oh but yeah
we'll see and people are linking their
videos and that's good that's exactly
what I wanted so that's awesome I
appreciate it
and and we'll get to those very soon
it's a good question
I'm excited okay scrolling down
okay Coalition is asking if Brian's
going to CES - I don't I don't think
Brian was at the last CES he's he's
probably still in the chat so let's see
if he answers okay
Chris says oh thanks for answering a
little token to support I appreciate
that Chris thank you for that
super chat my dude that goes a long way
I really do appreciate it and thanks
again for watching everyone who's
watching still right now how many people
do we have watching we're almost about
to wrap this one up
almost there we try to keep this to
about an hour 300 people watching that's
pretty cool for a Sunday night / Monday
whatever for you guys that is awesome I
really do appreciate this and again the
questions are they keep coming in so as
long as you guys ask questions we'll
keep going with this let's see a e
Crouch 2016 and where would you not
purchase the computer equipment from
that was out of context I think Luce
Luce fer what do you think of the I 580
600 K I think it's actually a really
great gaming CPU I have a discuss under
Cana in a separate rate and I really
can't tell the difference between that
and 8700 K well it's me he could swap
the two and I wouldn't be able to tell
you which ones which and that's good
especially from a value side for the i5
so if you want overclocked even better
for around 200 bucks it look it's gonna
go it's gonna put it head-to-head
against risin 7 especially older risin 7
I think that for the most part the i5 is
dead
I think locked i 5s primarily are just
about dead unless you can get them used
because you can get rise in seven eight
core 16 thread CPUs for the same price
and because of that it's really hard to
me to recommend CP that's gonna be
limited on a core side unless you're
just gaming and that's all you know
you're ever going to do which probably
isn't the case so we'll see but zombie
says you should add for Knight to the
title reviews
oh gosh does anyone have rattlesnake
phobia in the US I think most of the
rattlesnakes in the states are in the
southwest
yeah Arizona New Mexico region although
we do have rattlesnakes here too I'm
pretty sure in Florida let's see
ayyyy Crouch 2016 it says so much for
asking you anything by but I didn't I
just answer his question oh okay I guess
I'm totally lost
what do you think about the iPhone
excess charge 10s charge gate problem I
watched that video from Lou I'm it
appears to be something that's only
affecting some of them not all of them
I know marques Brownlee said that they
here's what we're not doing that but we
don't know how isolating this is we
don't know exactly what's causing and
although it does appear to be a software
issue we'll see I don't have a phone
test so I can't tell you firsthand but I
did watch that I am I am actively
watching it to see what Apple's response
will be to those videos
let's see crack honk PC is 1070 TI good
enough for 2k 6 here it's gaming it's
plenty good for that no problem at all
you don't need a 1080 TI for that kind
of gaming ok let's see Michael was
complaining earlier about not getting
his question answer and then he asked a
dumb question like do Intel processors
reproduce with AMD grandpa at lawns oh
my gosh let's see here
good ITX cases you can recommend I said
this I have to say every livestream the
the h200 is really good depends on what
kind of ITX forum factory well there's
some big ITX cases or small ITX cases
the no.2 or two is my favorite small ITX
case that my big ITX case favorite is
the h 200 i in a nutshell and i have
reviews on both of those cases see
mangoes only do you think an i7 7700 k
is worse than an i5 8600 k which is
better for the price that's a good
question I think those tests have been
run by other people on on other channels
in the past they're gonna be awfully
close some games do prefer higher core
counts but both are going to overclock
about the same
so it's really gonna depend I would say
if I would say the i-5 is probably the
better buy it's the newer architecture
even though it's not much of an
improvement but it's it's newer so I
would unless there's a big price
difference there I would pick the newer
one okay let's see here um ragin tech
ragin tech I they I saw them at a copy
text what are your opinions on Radeon
Pro duo Polaris blender cat haven't
tested them not really for me I'd only
there for most people it's a very niche
product for general consumer so we'll
see but I don't I don't think that
that's something that's gonna pertain to
a lot of people in here usually they're
really expensive too if I'm recalling
that correctly which cart you're talking
about it's zero powers Aaron hey Greg
hope you have a great weekend I have a
question does the horizon 17 is a there
is a rise as ft hundred worth it yeah
zero I've been promoting these a lot on
my social media pages yes they're worth
it
bend over would it be a problem Penta
four would it be proud to put two
different fans with different max rpm on
a CPU cooler yeah under most cases gonna
be fine unless you have like one fan
that's like pushing way more air in and
then the fan behind it's like not
pulling her out quick enough that might
be an issue but in general if they're
close to the same rpm they're gonna be
fine I mean the max rpm is really just
that's a worst case scenario most of the
time they're not gonna be operating at
max rpm if you not have calibrate fan
curves Kohli and then that quickshot
acid do you know anything about one
eight core intel chips will hit the
market I do not I have no idea I don't
have direct contacts with Intel so I
wouldn't know who to ask even if I was
curious but at this point it's all
pretty much just up in the air we expect
soon I would say within the next two or
three months for sure anything longer
than that and until it's just stalling
for the for the hype or maybe they
expect AMD is going to do something in
the future as well let's see
I didn't know funbucket I didn't know
super cheap old computer parts I guess
they're really mean they really mean it
when they say everything Auto and much
more I'll yell are talking to each other
okay
thoughts on upgrading from our 9 nano to
1080 1080 Ti
finally up up into 1440p not
anticipating upgrading GPUs until the
Jena if you're 20 series maybe end of
that so I want something that lasts is
the r9 nano not good enough for 1440p
that you're playing in RNA nano should
be close
I mean you've 1080p no problem but even
1440 I would say medium to high settings
in 1440p the Nano could probably handle
so I don't even know if you need to
upgrade
well it's mean unless you can get a 1080
for cheap and you can sell your nano and
get most of your investment back I don't
know if it's worth it to be honest with
you
Brian knows Brian's got those Intel
contacts but he can't say anything so
I'm gonna message him and I'll guess all
also an NDA so you can tell me let's see
well see if I can get into Dennis and
Tony do you think of GTX 2060 still a
premium price still doesn't contain our
tags
I don't know I talked about it early on
live stream Dennis but I have a feeling
that it's not gonna be our TX optimized
per se so we'll see I'm really not sure
though and there's not much from Nvidia
at this point for us to even speculate
Towe think you've had another $5 super
Chet i appreciate that's five euro
actually i was torn between the two
fifty millimeter and a dual five and a
quarter inch bei reservoir okay yeah
does the five-minute quarter at
reservoir have a much smaller capacity
I'm not too sure look at the dimensions
just do a volume calculation I'm really
not sure if you can just do the volume
of a cylinder make sure you use an inner
diameter and then the volume of cube
it's pretty straightforward that'll tell
you but I have a good feeling that the
250 mil is probably gonna have I don't
know I might be close either way I would
say that 250 mil is gonna be easier to
deal with in the long run but I mean the
five and a quarter inch reservoir is
actually kind of cool so might be
something to consider as well I'm really
not too sure
let's see Tasso should I throw away my
92 CI and pick up a twenty atti I can
play I play on 1080p though no stick
with United - yeah you don't need
anything other than that for a night for
a 1080p gaming let's do one more
question I need one more
good question here need something juicy
something good at folks should give me
something really good in this one then
we're gonna do the emoji spam don't spam
yet we're gonna do it though right after
this okay it's good question epic hunter
11 do you think the GTX 1050 Ti is worth
getting today or should we wait for a
new budget King to enter the arena again
this ties back to my stress on the used
market you can get so much better than a
1050 TI
for the same price as a new 1050 T I
like I said I got a I got a 1070 for 200
bucks that's not to say you can't you
might not be able to but in that price
range you can get a 1070 for 200 bucks
for a hundred bucks I got a 970 alright
so and that's gonna compete pretty close
for the 1050 TT I might be a little
better than the 1050 TI so you know it
really depends on where you feel
comfortable spending money but I think
buying new right now you should wait I
wouldn't I wouldn't buy a 1050 TI right
now we'll just wait and see what Nvidia
does but I have a good feeling that this
card is still gonna be expensive because
NVIDIA has done it to themselves at this
point we'll see and there's not much
competition from Andy on the other side
of the aisle you know our x5 70s and 5
eighties are still 200 bucks 5 60s might
be an option if you want to go with AMD
but if you want to stick with Nvidia
then yeah I think waiting is really the
only true answer there blaze Laskowski
thank you for that $3 super chat I
really appreciate it that's the
appreciate your answer keep up the good
work well thank you for that and thank
you for tuning in all of you thank you
