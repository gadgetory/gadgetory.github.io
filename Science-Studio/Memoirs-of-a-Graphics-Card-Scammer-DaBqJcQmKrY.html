cards used to be right at least those of
you who live in the United States right
now you can buy new cards for about MSRP
or something below that now which is
something we have experienced for just
about a year now a little more than that
due to the fact that people were buying
these cards in large quantities the
demand shot up so the price shut up it's
simple economics to talk about more in
this video or right here but what I want
to talk about in this video are the few
sellers out there trying to get full
asking price for their used hardware so
if Joe Schmo went out in 2017 and bought
himself an rx 580 for about $500 during
the peak of the mining craze when demand
was at its highest then he's going to
expect a decent return in mid 2018 right
if he paid 540 a year ago it's got to be
worth somewhere around 500 bucks now
right but that's not how markets work
especially used markets right now you
can buy new rx 5 a DS for under $300 in
fact 8 gig cars are going for as cheap
as about 240 bucks now on sites like
newing and Amazon pretty incredible I
have one link down below that I do
recommend you check out if you're in the
market but this guy here is trying to
get around $500 for this card and I'm
sorry there's no chance that's ever
going to sell well I say that but I'm
sure I'm overestimating the human
intellect of some out there so the
reason why this video exists is to bring
your attention the fact that graphics
card prices have come down significantly
but also to point out those out there
who are still trying to make a quick
buck trying to con you into spending way
more than you should for a used graphics
car that I'm sure has been through the
wringer especially it was mining right
we're talking full power loads running
24/7 that's what money carts typically
do those are the cards I would recommend
staying away from especially if the
people who were selling them won and you
know full on retail price or above
retail price currently for the car that
they've been just abusing so let's check
out the ad and see just how
cringe-worthy it really is
the Sennheiser PC 37 X is a new take on
gaming headsets prioritizing both a
sleek design and optimal comfort that's
a tricky combo their audio is top-notch
as always that's no surprise but the
microphone here is a thing of a beauty
you're actually listening to it right
now not bad for a plug-and-play headset
click the link in the video description
for more details so here is the sapphire
nitro rx 588 gig card in all of its
glory and it better be glorious if he's
asking 450 bucks for it mid August 2018
so I want to start off by reading the
description of this card because he
straight-up lies in this card I mean
it's it's and it's our I'm misleading
I'm just gonna go ahead and call it a
lie because I've tested this card
extensively and there's no way that it
can do what he says it can do so he is
definitely trying to mislead you and
here is how Sapphire Radeon nitro rx 580
graphics card this video graphics card
can play anything at 4k resolutions max
out settings no problem a gigabytes of
gddr5 overclockable edition first off
every graphics card that's relatively
modern is overclockable don't know why
bother mentioning that it's great you
gotta take a buffer though the 588
struggles at times to max out its buffer
it gigs are still future-proof if you
will but this statement right here can
play anything at 4k resolutions max out
settings no problem this is pure garbage
I mean I guess you could say any card
that's that supports 4k can max out
settings in game but you're gonna have
an absolutely terrible framerate so at
least this I mean this is at least
misleading at best at the worst it's
outright lying its falsifying info for
the purpose of trying to sell a product
and you you probably I mean this would
ultimately rest in the hands of the
buyer to do due diligence and confirm
that this card actually can do what the
seller says it can do but it's it's
lying it's it's misleading and it's
trying to get people to buy a card based
on false information in my opinion this
should be illegal so I actually just
finished messaging the guy I don't think
you'd respond in time for the filming of
this video but his response was the
following I sent him the the link for
the product that you could buy a new egg
for around 280 bucks I mean you can buy
these for as cheap as 239 dollars here
with a $20 promo code this is from a
soos
but basically saying hey like I can get
these new for 250 bucks are you still
asking for 50 for this and his response
was okay then do you want it for 250
bucks and I said well I don't want to
pay 250 for a used card when I could buy
the same card new for that price and
then he responded something along the
lines of well it's basically new only
lightly used but okay and that's all I
got from him so I assume he's not coming
down off his 250 asking price now and
that beckons the question is it worth
buying this card used when you could get
one new for maybe 20 30 bucks more the
exact same model or one even cheaper
than this that uses the same you know
GPU but just is manufactured by a
different company and the answer is no
you should never buy a card like this
used if you can spend the same amount of
money and get one new with a viable
warranty that likely hasn't been you
know put through torture workloads like
I'm sure this guy uses he says he bought
it for 550 bucks I'm sure he bought it
in the middle of the mining craze and he
may have actually used this card for
mining so we'll see this is just you
know this could be just a miner trying
to liquidate his assets right trying to
get rid of the cards these no longer
using or instead of using and trying to
either make a return on it or get as
much of his money back as possible but
I'm sorry the market is not on your side
but in the midst of this statement here
that he bought it new for 550 bucks
another issue that I have is that he
says like this is so vague easily be its
GTX versions this is the latest and
greatest okay well what GTX versions are
you talking about I this this is like
your cue that he's uninformed about the
about the card itself
he's uninformed about the entire
competition going on between a Vidya and
AMD if you're trying to sell a product
and you're willing to just make bland
statements and dark that aren't backed
by anything then you should probably as
the buyer or potential buyer do a bit of
research into these statements to verify
or deny them and a GTX version that he's
talking about I'm sure is a gtx 1060 but
even even then I mean the 1060 is in
general a better dx11 performer that 580
does a little better at the x12 there
are more stream processors different
things that work with those different
api's but in a nutshell I mean this
statement here is not true easily beats
GTX versions I mean yeah okay beats the
1050 it beats the 1030 but the car that
this competes directly with the GTX 1060
it does not easily beat
there there are there are no games out
there where this card absolutely
destroys the 1060 so another statement
again that's just misleading trying to
make the sale and frankly a little
disgusting that he's willing to do this
in try his best to take advantage of
someone who isn't willing to do again an
ounce of research down here just
specifications he copied and pasted all
this crap from from websites so it's
really not interesting but these
statements up here I just feel like like
come on dude this is a con at best now
the side note these cards have
definitely come down in price if you
aren't into AMD cards that say you want
the 1060 instead just because you're
more familiar with GeForce experience
what have you
these cards are they're a little more
expensive in general the 1066 eight
cards are still costing around 300 bucks
if you can find a 1066 gig for under
$300 I'd say that's a pretty good
bargain here's a 6 gig here for $2.99
and it's 289 after $10 rebate if you
want to account for rebates oftentimes
it takes forever to get your money back
from these things but this is much
better right than what it used to be so
graphics card prices have definitely
come down and some people including this
guy right here just don't want to
believe that that's the case so if he
asked me what I would offer this guy
exchange for his used rx 580 I'd say not
a dime over 200 bucks that's around a
20% discount for a used card and we
don't know how heavily it was abused it
was used for mining is strictly gaming
but at the end of the day doesn't matter
it all comes down to what you feel your
money is worth if you're going to risk
everything for the sake of not having a
warranty to save 40 bucks then go right
ahead at the end of the day it's your
money you decide how to spend it but
don't do this guy any favors don't give
him more than the card is worth new to
me it makes absolutely no sense all
you're doing is making him feel like
he's justified in his asking price and I
just want to I want to tell this guy
that he's just completely detached from
reality it just it it's funny to see
people ask for these prices they think
that they can get their money back
despite what the new market is telling
them but at the same time it also just
makes me angry because I know that
somebody out there especially someone
who doesn't watch this video right since
it's a two minutes of it to know what I
have to say about it someone might
actually fall for this right so this
video is more of a PSA most of my
craziest videos are to show you guys
that there are people out there trying
to take advantage of you and if you
don't do an ounce of research you will
be the person to fall victim to
this scam I think that's what it is I
think it's an outright scam and anybody
who's not willing to take the time to
look up on do a Gramma's on the fact
that these prices are coming out
significantly the new market deserves to
be scammed that's how I see it
let me know you think in the comments
below give this video a thumbs up if
thought it was cool just liked it if you
feel like a bit opposite click that red
