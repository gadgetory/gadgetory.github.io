straightforward idea typically the
number of pixels spending the height of
a display indicates its relative
resolution for example 1080p for 1080
pixels from top to bottom 2160p 4 mm 160
of those pixels etc I use the word
relative because there are variations in
screen dimensions for example this
ultrawide monitor to my right which you
can check out in more detail in the card
above me is still technically a 1080p
monitor even though the pixel dimensions
are 1080 by 2560 these resolutions
however do not define pixel density that
is the number of individual pixels that
span a particular length I've attached a
link in this video's description to a
website that will actually calculate PPI
for you it's pretty cool simply type in
your screens pixel dimensions followed
by its diagonal length and voila you'll
have your screens pixel density microfi
okay I should also know that you can do
this with any screen size including your
phone tablet computer monitor or
television but ok knowing your screens
pixel density is one thing but what does
this have to do with viewing distance
well if you think about it there is a
certain distance away from any screen in
which individual pixels become
indiscernible Steve Jobs said it better
than anyone else in any display there
are pixels here's four of them we start
off with the Retina display by
dramatically increasing the pixel
density now the Retina display has 326
pixels per inch
there's never been a display like this
on a phone people haven't even dreamed
about a display like this on a phone but
it's more than that it turns out that
there's a magic number right around 300
pixels per inch that when you hold
something around 10 or 12 inches away
from your eyes is the limit of the human
retina to differentiate the pixels and
so they're so close together when you
get it this 300 pixels per inch
threshold that all the sudden things
start to look like continuous continuous
curves like text looks like you've seen
it in a fine printed book unlike you've
ever seen on an electronic display
before and at 326 pixels per inch we are
comfortably over that limit at this
point the display in question will
become a Retina display apple's
trademark for a display so sharp the
human eye is incapable of distinguishing
individual pixels and this is true if
you have a phone with a 1080p display
and a screen size of around five inches
holding the phone around half an arm's
length away from your eyes will result
in this effect the same principle
applies to TVs I've attached a retina
calculator in the description of this
video as well so this is where the meat
of the topic begins past a certain
viewing distance pixels become
indistinguishable regardless of the
resolution even a 640 by 480 resolution
which is ancient by today's standards
becomes retina at some point given a
particular screen size this chart
attempts to quantify optimal resolutions
given screen size on the x-axis and
viewing distance on the Y there are
several types of this chart and each
varies to a degree but we'll assume this
model for televisions and a separate
model for monitors and which viewers
typically sit much closer to the screen
so let's look at 480p while not a
standard any longer we can start here
and work our way down if we assume a
screen size of say 40 inches and a
viewing distance of 20 feet or just over
6 meters all resolutions including 480p
will look the same that is you won't be
able to see the difference between a 4k
image and a 480p image given this
particular screen size and viewing
distance it's a pretty radical idea
right
but ok let's try another using 720p as
our base this time let's assume our
screen size is 60 inches indicative of a
fairly large TV although you won't find
many TVs of this size with only a 720p
resolution but bear with me you'll see
where I'm going with this let's also
assume a viewing distance of 15 feet
typical for most folks watching
television in a living room with this
screen size and at this viewing distance
all HD resolutions are indistinguishable
if the definition of HD is throwing you
for a bit of a loop go ahead and check
out the card above me so this is crazy
1080p in 4k have become the television
standards over the past several years
pushing 720p to the wayside but
according to this logic those additional
pixels in both the vertical and
horizontal are completely pointless past
a certain distance if you're finding all
this hard to believe you can test this
actually with a 4k monitor pull up any
modern game something like Grand Theft
Auto 5 and then set your gaming
resolution to 1080p then sit an arm's
length away from a computer monitor
roughly 2 feet or 60 centimeters well
use this graph for this test as it's
much less forgiving at close distances
if your monitor size is 25 inches and
you're sitting 2 feet away from your
screen then by this graphs definition
1080p is not your optimal resolution and
you should be able to discern some
individual pixels on your screen or at
least notice some jaggies on round
objects now with this mental picture
still in mind change the in-game
resolution to 4k you should see a clear
difference between this and the 1080p
version for those of you who
consistently game in 4k this should be
of no surprise most of you only are made
about 2 feet away from your monitor at
all times and you can definitely see the
difference between 1080p and 2160p
given the screen size however if your
optimal monitor viewing distance is 4
feet instead of 2 the two resolutions
that were mentioned will likely be
indistinguishable so in this case
purchasing a 4k monitor rather than a
1080p one would be a waste of additional
money assuming your viewing distance
will remain fixed all in this video with
one final thought optimal viewing
distance is dependent on screen size and
pixel density however an independent
factor also plays a role here eyesight
20/20 vision is a ratio that compares
your eyesight to that of an average
human being it can be translated to mean
I see the same amount of detail from 20
feet away that the average person sees
from 20 feet away
a person with 2015 vision could say the
following I see the same amount of
detail from 20 feet away that
the average person sees from 15 feet
away indicating that that person has an
above-average eyesight in this case that
person's entire view chart would be
skewed because he or she can see a
greater level of detail and a greater
number of pixels to an extent from the
same distance inversely if that person's
eyesight is say 20 40 then the entire
graph would be skewed in the opposite
direction because he or she can only see
the same level of detail that a human
with normal eyesight can if that person
sits twice as close to the monitor in
question this goes without saying the
graphs up and showing in this video are
not fixed but rather change from person
to person and case to case light levels
the type of screen being used and even
the degree of eyesight correction
implemented will all change these
results by certain degrees nonetheless
the overall point still stands optimal
viewing distance is determined by pixel
density and screen size if you want to
get fancy with it I suggest performing
calculations similar to those you can
find here before purchasing that 60-inch
flat panel or 34 inch ultra wide if you
like the topic discussed in this video
be sure to give this thing a thumbs up
give it a thumbs down if you feel the
