investigation of the RX 480
AMD's newest release I've already
uploaded my initial review of the RX 40
check it out right here as well as a
discussion on the power draw issue which
I experienced firsthand by the way in an
ultra cheap PC simulating a sharp CPU
bottleneck indulge yourself in those
curiosities once this first part moves
out of the way now remember what the
intent of the RX 480 is not was but is
nothing has changed since the release
date this video card exists for the sake
of budget-conscious gamers in both 1080p
and 1440p AMD also claims that VR is a
possibility with this card if paired
with an adequate platform but I'm not
big into VR as of yet and experiences
for the most part are fairly subjective
so what I decided to do in this video
was pair the card with my gtx 980ti
now i've already discussed explicit
multi adapter and grande detail in a
video you can check out right here but
something I did not mention because I
accidentally edited that segment of the
video out before the final cut is that
GPU order matters and what I mean by
that is that the card arrangement in
terms of which is placed on the top PCIe
slot and which is placed underneath
subsequently can dramatically affect
performance this is why I placed my
980ti in the top slot when I ran a
simultaneously with the gtx 1070 the
980ti was the better performer and
theoretically had I rotated the two
frame rates would have fractionally
diminished with this combination however
I'm just morbidly curious clearly the 90
DTI is the all-around better card and
according to these independent tests
that is with only one card and a test
bench at a time the 980ti yielded twice
the frame rate of the arts 480 across
the board but what will happen when we
place the RX 480 in the top slot like so
and the gtx 980ti which is in the
recurrently underneath it mid-range card
with one of the best available and then
again in Reverse what will happen when
we place the 980ti on the top and the RX
for 80 underneath and up the chitchat on
my end let's find out first up was the
RX 480 in the top slot keep in mind this
is also the card from which our display
cable will run i had to install both the
AMD crimson driver for the 480 as well
as the nvidia driver from scratch these
weren't plug-and-play once both cards
were installed and detected I hopped
into ashes of the singularity DirectX 12
mode and enabled multi GPU support the
results shocked me a bit in all honesty
I expected the frame rates to fall
somewhere just above the
kiai is independent frame rates but that
was not the case at all in fact in two
of the three batches and the average
overall the combo didn't keep up with a
single TI
disappointing given the fact that the
combo hypothetically would have cost an
additional 33% here in the US so what
this is telling me is that explicit
multi adapter is leveraging the primary
display device much more heavily than I
presumed it was I actually came up with
an analogy to help explain this a little
better yeah bear with me on this one I
want you to picture a wagon got it a
wagon and a gentleman by the name of rx
already up front he's a fairly fast
fellow not the quickest but efficient
and productive he's pulling the wagon at
his usual pace again quickly but not the
quickest now imagine a second gentleman
or woman I suppose in this case pushing
the same wagon from behind her name is
gtx 980ti now she is quick I'm talking
Usain Bolt quick and she uses her insane
speed to push the wagon from behind as
fast as she can well she wants to but
there's a problem she's being held up by
the RX 40 up front she'll give the 480 a
boost and force him to pull good bit
faster but if she pushes too fast she'll
topple the 480 and tear some flesh off
his bones equivalent to the massive
screen tearing see what I did there
he would experience if a very weak card
was paired with an overpowered one and
this is why it's recommended to cards of
similar compute performance be paired
together otherwise you'll have one card
rendering individual tiles at
lightning-fast rates and the other card
lagging far behind with its tile
rendering hence the screen tearing by
the way I tried pairing the 980ti with
my g2 10 as promised it's a card with
2,816 cuda cores paired with a card
posting only 16 of those but was unable
to open the game the RX 480 thankfully
is nowhere near this week it still holds
its own it doesn't slow down the 92 TI
to any substantial extent however it is
worth noting that the 480 did prevent
the 980 TI underneath from rendering
tiles of each frame at its full speed
following suit we have the 92 TI paired
with the rx 480 in which the ti was
inserted into the top slot and the RS 40
was inserted into the one underneath the
display cable was plugged into the 980
TI the primary display device I should
note at this point that I had to
reinstall both sets of drivers the
computer freaked out booted into its
ultra low resolution mode and prompted
for driver updates when I switched them
so I uninstalled everything and
reinstalled both sets starting first
with the primary display driver it is
recommended that you install in this
order and as for the results
better not significantly better but
better overall and across the board
we're looking at around 15 to 20 percent
frame rate gains still not enough in my
opinion to justify the second cards
existence but I expect better
optimization in the future to increase
these margins also keep in mind that
ashes is currently the only game that
officially supports explicit multi
adapter so unless you plan on playing
only ashes of the singularity on your
bright and shiny new rig which I highly
doubt don't go this route in this case
the 90 DT I was pulling the wagon from
the front at its usual lightning fast
pace and was being aided by the RX for
80 from behind in this arrangement in
the 90 DT I wasn't being held back by
the 4 a rather the TI was forcing the
480 to keep up and every now and then a
few steps of the 480 would push the
wagon even faster remember the
efficiency of this direct x12 technology
depends almost entirely on the
performance gap between the two cards
being paired AMD cards appeared to do a
bit better than nvidia in this regard
thanks to hardware based asynchronous
compute and reduce driver overhead and
again cards that similar compute
performance work better in tandem i
tested an r9 380 with the RX 480 and
found that the results of this pair
weren't far from those obtained from the
RX 480 plus 980 TI combination although
the total price of the AMD set was
significantly lower
likewise pairing the gtx 980ti with the
gtx 1070 you'll did massive gains as
well 50% overall from just a single
980ti so here it is folks the current
state of explicit multi adapter let's
hope this trend continues in future
DirectX 12 titles the possibilities are
endless here and it appears as though
EMA is as efficient if not more
efficient than the current states of
both SLI and crossfire if you like the
experiments conducted in this video be
sure to give this thing a thumbs up give
it a thumbs down if you feel the
complete opposite or if you hate
everything about life be sure to follow
me on twitter at sc/st salazar got the
little yeah just look at that right
there it's also in the description as
well along with my facebook and
instagram handles and I guess URL for
the Facebook thing be sure to suggest
future video ideas in the comment
sections below remember I read all
comments I really do I scroll i actually
today i scroll through like 230 of them
and are applied to about 20 i'm about a
10% chance i'll respond if you respond a
day after the videos and post it I tend
to read most of my comments
immediately after the videos been
uploaded I just stick around so I'll
upload the video and then I'll refresh
the page every minute or so and respond
to as many of them as I can so if you
catch the video early you might be able
to talk with me a little bit more be
sure to stay tuned
we're going to do one more experiment
with the arts for a team on a parrot
with the FX 6300 should be interesting
being that that right now is a pretty
good sweet spot for the average CPU in a
gaming rig and so I'll be able to throw
that in there we'll see how that works
out and I'm just kind of blabbing on at
this point because I want the video to
seem longer than it actually is
this is science studio thanks for
learning with us
