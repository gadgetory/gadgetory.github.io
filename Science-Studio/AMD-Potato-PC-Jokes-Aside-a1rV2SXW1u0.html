am not joking that's more than 15 times
larger than the 14 enemy to process
current Intel CPUs and AMD GPUs utilized
today by 12 kilobytes of l2 cache that
was not integrated into the CPU die
itself a motherboard fitted with a CPU
slot not a CPU socket so what processor
am I talking about
check this thing out the AMD k7 one of
only four generations of CPUs to ever
take advantage of a CPU slot in this
case you're looking at a slot a AMD's
first attempt at a slot one mimic
created by Intel two years earlier this
was a great mimic actually both the AMD
and Intel slots were identical you could
place a compatible Pentium 2 in an AMD
slot and vice versa although nothing
would happen the wiring of the circuits
beneath the socket on the respective
boards mid cross compatibility and
impossible tasks but I mean that makes
sense if you're wondering this k7 wasn't
free but it might as well have been I
actually received this processor from a
family member who was scavenging old
computer parts I guess that does make it
free the K 7 motherboard was a bit
difficult to find but it wasn't
expensive by any means the only
compatible Ram was SDRAM which had a
unique to knotch design and a
theoretical operating frequency of 200
megahertz thanks to double data rate
technology hence DDR SDRAM for graphics
I found a 3dfx voodoo3 1000 graphics
card a card you would have found in a
computer of this caliber daring it today
it's nothing fancy features a single VGA
port no cooler that tells you anything
right there 16-bit color support limited
textures and a great deal of competition
and videos GeForce 256 soon stole the
show I discussed the 256 in greater
detail in a video you can check out in
the card above me
now as for power pretty much anything
with molex connectivity would have
worked I actually pulled one out of
another computer 320 Watts solid with
plenty of peripheral support since the
motherboard only supported IDE also
known as parallel ata unlike serial ata
or SATA that we use today I was forced
to you the hard drive with an IDE
interface someone actually gave one to
me for free I doubt he could find a
compatible computer you'll also want a
sound card if you're interested in
actually hearing anything sound blasters
are always a nice touch a CD drive was
also a staple in the late 90s so it's
going in here as well for the case I
went a bit
fancy and fan boyish but just for fun
here's a thermal take v3 AMD Black
Edition gaming case wouldn't be my first
choice but it fits the AMD old-school
theme and the Scorpion on the side looks
freakin awesome
so did it turn on yes after about five
or six attempts the IDE cables were
finicky I couldn't connect my CD drive
to the motherboard at all and yes I know
the difference between slave and master
it just wouldn't post I was hoping to
showcase some old cd-rom games but that
wasn't going to be possible with his
configuration because I couldn't connect
the cd-rom drive to the computer at all
alien vs. predator loaded uphill without
the CD but it froze just as I was
entering the campaign this happened
again and again and again I had games
like sim golf rollercoaster tycoon 2 and
The Sims all lined up to show you but
given the circumstances I'm surprised it
even booted up at all it actually took
about 12 minutes to do even that
nonetheless here's my point the kinds of
games you could play on this PC similar
to the games that I just mentioned were
not the kinds of games you wanted to
just boost the frame rates of in fact
most of these were lost relatively low
frame rates anyway and the VGA interface
isn't capable of extreme rates in its
own right I did however enjoy building
this PC and I hope that you at least
were able to take a bit of history home
with you from this video it's not every
day you get to tinker with a slot CPU
let alone one that actually works if you
like this old-school retro just for
kicks AMD PC build give the video a
thumbs up give it a thumbs down if
you're the complete opposite or if you
hate everything about life quickly
subscribe but if you haven't already
stay tuned for on and 390 benchmarks
this is not an R 9 390 in here this is a
gtx 980ti if you follow me on twitter
you would have already known that be
sure to do so at sc/st Salazar this is
science studio thanks for learning with
us
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
