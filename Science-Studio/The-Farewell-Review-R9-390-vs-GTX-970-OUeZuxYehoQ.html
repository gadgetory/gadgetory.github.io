480 of which we hear much more about in
the coming days folks stay tuned for
that I've decided to throw it back for a
change and pit head-to-head the gtx 970
from the Green Team and the r9 390 from
the red team both cards are very
similarly priced and as you'll see here
in a second very similarly perform wow
that that collapsed on itself very
similar competitors that is that is what
i meant to say but very quickly let's
run through the test bench I have behind
me I can't use my hands because misty
hasn't tied up and I 760 700k
overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz and 16
gigabytes in 28 you buy variants of
Geall super loose ddr4 clock to three
thousand megahertz all the games by the
way are stored on a one terabyte western
digital caviar black drive I would also
like to thank Mark Borgen for hooking us
up with his total war war hammer game
code from steam he was very generous
with us here in the studio and sided
hook us up because he thought that it
would make for a great benchmark and he
was right total war war hammer is a very
CPU intensive game so I be interesting
to see how those cards fair with this
game and with all the others we have in
the stack today so without further ado
here are the graphs
you
over the toss up folks I can't honestly
tell you which cards better it just
depends completely on the game if you
want to face it just off of the heaven
benchmark which stresses only the GPU
cpu is not involved at all then it would
go to the gtx 970 but when it comes to
games it was split 50-50 the GTX 970 to
better in four of the eight games and
the r9 390 bed did better than the other
four of the eight so I really don't know
what else to tell you there it just
comes down to optimization and I've
noticed that arm the 09 3 90 is actually
doing better in games that it's
typically bundled with so hit man was
included with the 09 3 90 at some point
and so was total war war hammer so both
of those games the 09 391 interesting
AMD's pairing their cards with games
that it knows that it will help perform
the gtx 970 in that's that's actually
pretty pretty smart on their port but
with that i want to leave the rest of
this video to you and your comments in
the comments sections below i'm sure
that's a lot of you have have had either
the gtx 970 or they are 93 90 at some
point in your pc gaming careers so i
want you to give your final thoughts on
either or both of these cards in the
comment sections below remember i read
every single comment yes even in the
videos that have thousands and thousands
of comments i read them all daily I wake
up in the morning I pick up my phone and
I have an email list with every comment
sometimes I'll just go into the
dashboard on YouTube and read them all
that way but I do read them all even
though I don't reply to all them that
would just be an insane amount of
writing on my part but I do appreciate
all of your input be sure to do all of
that let me know what you think about
both cards the results you just saw and
stay tuned for for this guy right here
not too much longer folks you're gonna
be impressed this is science to do
thanks for learning with this
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
