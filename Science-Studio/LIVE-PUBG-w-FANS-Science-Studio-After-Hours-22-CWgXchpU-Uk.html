waiting to see the livestream waiting
for it and we're sixteen by nine again
okay so for those who are wondering what
that was all about I was using my ultra
wide desktop as like my main monitor
until I switched to these dual monitors
here and that was an 18 by 9 White's 121
by 9
yeah it was twenty-one by nine and so it
was taking that format right and it was
trying to downscale a 1080p or 1440p
image wasn't really down scaling it but
it was actually I was down scaling it to
like what 1764 by 720 so it was like a
stretched 720p image which is really
weird so yeah that was and then I
canceled the stream in OBS and then
tried to change the value that way and
then all that happened was it just
shrunk the video but left the format on
YouTube still an ultra ultra wide is
supported on YouTube that's a lot of
people don't know that and I've done a
couple of ultra wide videos so it's
native eww but so when I did that it
didn't trick you too but just tricked
OBS so we had black bars on both sides
but I wasn't stretched anymore still not
good though because you guys are
watching likely on sixteen by nine
screens and that would mean that I
appear smaller on those aspects so
that's why I had to restart the stream
altogether so I do apologize for the for
the weirdness I know I'm a little low on
the mic side and that's because if I put
it directly in front of my mouth you're
gonna complain about breathing so it's
one or the other
like that right there I'm sure you
probably thought that was really
annoying just let me know if you prefer
the quieter mic or not either way I'm
gonna get shafted victor's 22 I saw you
in the last one I appreciate the super
chat my dude and for the long support I
see you in discord all the time he says
hope you enjoyed the holiday didn't
video break antitrust anti consumer laws
with their statement about no new GPS
for a long time I don't
think so I mean a long time is super
subjective and like many people were
saying they may just been something that
you know Jensen was frustrated at right
people asked him over and over this was
supposed to be a separate launch a
separate debut pre-computation and when
people asked about something that you're
still working on it can get annoying and
also I mean again how do you gauge a
long time right you can't really you
can't sue somebody for your
interpretation of a long time as far as
I'm aware if their version is different
than yours so it's not misleading either
I mean that's the whole point like it
can be misleading but that's entirely
subjective and yeah I'm pretty sure
you're not gonna be able to prove that
in a court of law at least I wouldn't do
that
Adam Stephenson says how are those
headphones treating you I don't know you
guys tell me so I like the Michael lot
on this headset it's a lot better than
the other headsets I've used in the past
I've used some Coolermaster razor and
course they're headsets and this one is
my favorite sound quality of course
Sennheiser you guys know how good
Sennheiser is and then the mic is
actually something that surprised me
didn't expect it to be this good but it
is so that's that's why I am using it
it's probably the best on you guys's
ears although I will occasionally
breathe really heavily into it so I'll
try my best to limit those and yes these
are the ones that I've been promoting
and like those pre-rolls you've seen in
some recent videos with mass drop so if
you guys want if you go and buy through
the links that I've been posting on
those videos and it will give me a big
helping hand because then they'll want
to come back to me and promote more
stuff so basically I make money and
that's how it all works right we're all
in this to make a living if you're doing
it full-time
and companies like that are great
because their products have a lot to do
with our audiences obviously I want to
promote products that you guys would
actually use otherwise what good is it
to me or to you guys and also to the
company paying me to promote products
that they expect me to sell or try to
sell to you guys and that's why it's
also tricky finding products that are
worth promoting and then trying to stay
neutral or you know you have to separate
a review from a promotion so if I review
a product and I know that this company
might want to do a promotion later on
the
and you have to know that if you give it
a bad review they're probably not gonna
want you to promote it or if you tried
to promote it after giving it a bad
review to make you look bad so you kind
of have to like openly accept the fact
that if the product sucks or it's just
not something you would choose first
it's probably not something that you're
gonna want to promote that's not to say
that you know like cases for example PC
cases there's tons of PC cases you can
choose from everyone has a different you
know preference when it comes to that
and strange looks is basically I make
money and so cases are different because
I might think a case is really great and
you might not and that's more subjective
and that's why I feel more comfortable
with cases promoting those even if I
don't think they're the best out there
and most of the time cases are gonna be
pretty good for the money
and there are some that are very good
there is some that are pretty trashy in
my opinion but again it's all my opinion
so you know if I promote something that
I don't think is the best out there it's
not because I just want money it's
because I genuinely see value in
promoting something that you guys might
actually buy otherwise that company's
gonna be disappointed with me for not
selling to you guys and then they're
never gonna want to pay me money again
so there you go
Transparency studio for the win but you
guys know how this works you know it's
just they want an ROI and that ROI is
you guys buying products that I promote
in those pre-rolls
and there's a fine distinction between
that and a review which is unpaid which
is supposed to be unbiased and yeah
let's see restream will keep the same
event restream will keep a symphony used
I don't know what that means well wills
was chatting with me honest I'm wills
doing a bunch of the DL stuff right now
cuz Will's a software guy and C Carson
says he actually made me buy the fantex
p300 hey I like the p3 the P 300 is a
really good price what at 49 bucks and
you get tempered glass you get RGB I
think it's a great budget oriented case
the deep cool case that we saw it
Computex is gonna be a pretty sweet
contender so maybe do a head-to-head
against that and then the P 350 X for
what ten bucks more I think is that much
better and I think I said in that review
that I would prefer the P 350 x over the
P 300 if I had you know
ten dollar kind of Headroom if I could
work with that and maybe squeeze out ten
more bucks in the budget which most
people I assume can then I would go for
that instead Eric these are the
Sennheiser PC 37 X's I promoted these a
lot in recent videos if you haven't you
haven't been watching the channel if you
haven't seen up in promoting these like
in every other video recently but if you
buy one do it through that link if you
feel like being a cool kid cuz then mass
drop will be happy with me and then you
can see more awkward ads on the channel
or awkward sponsored spots
let's see Trojan gaming hey Greg which
rise in CPU should I get for a gaming
and streaming PC I think the risin 5
line up is a great middle ground you can
go all-out obviously and get the 2700 or
2700 X but the 2,600 2,600 extra the
best bang for the buck CPUs I think on
the market right now in the new
department and that's where I would keep
it so I appreciate that next next satra
says the ad is brilliant I wanted to be
weird quirky but cool at the same time
so I chose kind of an uppity like rock
theme song and some weird plays with the
left and right audio tracks anyway
hopefully uh hopefully you guys at least
enjoyed it or didn't think it was
annoying
cuz that's that's like my biggest fears
like the ad is annoying and that shiz
people away from buying the product cuz
that's not what I want to do anyway I
agree I think the lightest has done some
pretty awkward ads but I feel like Linus
does that on purpose I think there's a
place for awkwardness and like if it
gets people talking about the product
then that's a good thing you know if
people are like hey check out how like
cringy this ad is that could be good
exposure right at least gets the brand
name out there the product name out
there so it's something to consider you
know going super awkward my brother just
said he's gonna stream site and streams
tonight me jiejie um let's see will is
I'm live now
ok so if you read a fan tech center
looks you check that case out soon I
that's an older case I mean it's not a
super new one I actually have the Evolve
X right now it's chilling right there
that's the evolved X and I'm gonna be
building two systems in it two PC's in
the same mid tower case pretty
incredible how they did that we talked
about it at Computex but that'll be a
really fun fun thing to uh to build in
because it looks beautiful first off
I've never actually built personally and
an evolved case I can't like that I can
remember but I've built in many like
fantex cases look very similar on the
inside in each price category and I
built in like the end though em
and the pro-am and at a p4 hundreds of
course which I think are really great
cases so anyway Johnny C says the mic on
the headphones sound really good thank
you that was something actually pointed
out in the pre-roll
was that hey this is this is something
that actually is pretty good for the
money for once most gaming headsets cost
100 bucks and they put a trashy mic in
it but of course was sent house you get
the good audio quality and the good
video okay so we have a discord server
if you guys are watching right now I'm
assuming you're interested in some pub G
gameplay so I will cut right to the
chase least after talking to you guys
for 10 minutes trying to stall here the
discord link has been spammed in the
chat box for quite a while now if you
haven't seen it yet scroll up if you
have seen it you're probably gonna see
it again if you haven't joined you
should definitely join and we have a lot
of people right now waiting in the pub G
waiting room channel on the discord so
if you guys want to play with us feel
free to jump in
it's gonna be huge war mode we're
setting up so if you die you're just
response kind of like Call of Duty other
games like that so you're not gonna have
to sit out and watch everyone else kill
themselves before you get to play again
just just a heads up on that I'm pulling
my keyboard closer I realize that it's
like under my monitor okay here we go so
let's give it a shot I am going to do
something weird here I want to move the
chat box right here I know you guys can
see this I'm just gonna try my best to
get it to look good okay there you go
will is linking it so if you want to
join the game we've got a lot of people
in here already
then please feel free to do that will I
think
if the game is full yet I'm gonna hop in
custom match war mode I don't see it
okay I don't think we'll is created it
yet if he has and it's private oh okay
one of a hundred players yeah Brandon
it's called uh okay I'm in there now
Brandon that's if you're watching the
live stream it's called jump Maude we
just call it jump Maude because it's how
we get people to actually click on the
game they think it's actually a mod but
it's not we're not adding anything okay
so I am ready to go and if wills
watching will will know that we're ready
to get this thing public and I'm going
to switch now see my hotkeys work I'm a
little bit of a noob oh yeah check that
out so we're good to go and I'm going to
turn up the in-game chat when I in game
chat but the in-game audio just to see
if it works
someone's in here someone wasn't here
okay cool okay cool alright so that was
will he is going to wait a few more
minutes we're making each the this whole
thing here we're making it public so
that you guys can see it and we'll be
good to go now what we're doing with the
war mode here eight-man squad's third
person you can switch to first if you
want otherwise in first person here log
to there the region is North America in
case you're wondering the map is Erin
goal all you got to do if you go into
the custom I'll go ahead and back out
just so you guys can see what I did so
if we back out if you're on the home
screen like this right here right if
you're on this then all you got to do is
click custom match open beta then click
war mode make sure up top here your
region is actually this isn't even a
region lock used to be region lock
that's weird
if you go up to the top and the search
bar just type in jump
again we do this just because we want to
attract people it's not actually a mod
we don't mod the game at all
jump mod and then you see here Aaron go
and you join it and then you're good to
go so if you want to do that you can do
that right now and we'll be
live-streaming everything if you guys
streams tonight me I swear I'm gonna be
so mad but it's fair game I don't really
care honestly I just want to have fun
try something out and it looks like
we're getting people in here so that's
good news it looks like we're while
we're gonna have a ton of teams is this
a full hundred yeah this looks like a
full hundred teams here so 80 88 96 and
then 100 so yeah and the cool thing is
once you get more people in here it'll
start filling up more and then you will
slowly start to yeah you'll see it'll
fill up really quick what's up will how
many people are we playing with okay so
if we're playing with 15 mmm we can do
teams of five and then limit it to like
50 people depending on how big he made
this the zone okay I think we'll just
realise they can be heard unless Chaney
there we go looking good let's move
salad bar 101 that's Brandon move him in
our team and oh we can actually see the
match setting so that's cool yeah they
added that that wasn't something they
used to see see Brandon and he's in team
3 Salib are 101
okay yeah that's that's fine do that do
or did you just start it will like well
now you have to restart everything yeah
now you gotta wait for everybody to
rejoin this is gonna take forever
Will's a noob
hold on bugbear you'll be able to join
we'll just message yeah we'll still
learning he's still learning the ropes
I'm gonna fire will we're gonna get any
tech guy I'm still like in the loading
I'm getting lit okay leave match GG hey
at least you guys know you can see the
game right I'm also interested to see
how interested to see how the 87
hierarchy holds up because I don't
usually stream from this system this is
my gaming rig but I usually stream on
the horizon system I haven't gone
through and checked anything specific I
am encoding I think with the CPU it
might be it might be the graphics card I
actually have no idea what the trick
let's see here
encoder video stream general where am I
okay we're using software okay so that's
good bit rates pretty low it's like 2500
jumping says where do I send my resume
so yeah for those who are watching
you're wondering what the heck's going
on will made a noob mistake so we're so
I have to make one then right
okay I was wondering why I didn't show
anything all right so I'm gonna call it
jump mod deathmatch it's just what I
always call it and give me two seconds
it'll be it'll be alive we'll do San
Hawk and okay it's it's live now and
it's public so they should be able to
join automatically well I don't say map
is Erin goal I think lik Erin goal
San Hawk there we go so you guys can see
how we're setting this up if you want to
set up your own custom custom server if
you will for pub G let's see this is
this is the basic stuff here so you can
change the size of the teams I think
we're gonna leave it at eight and then
you want to keep it right at least
comment well a common denominator of 8
would be a multiple of 864 just
something like that so it works better
and let's do rules so in the rules we're
gonna have the goal score set to 300
raise the time a little bit it sucks to
to end on the time you want to end more
or less on the score so I always raise
the time a little higher than necessary
team elimination off DBA no revive on
here's what we do this is something we
do revive time is 1 second so it's
instant right and then bleed out time 5
seconds don't touch that that's just how
long it takes for somebody to bleed out
and die after they're knocked out and
then health after revive so this is how
much health you're left with
percentage-wise after you are revived by
a teammate which again takes only one
second and we're gonna bump this to
leave it a facility now we did have it
at 70 and it was just super overkill
like we weren't killing anybody
and then sometimes we do it at 10% right
so it's instant revive but you only have
10% health which kind of shafts people
let's do like 25 we'll do 25 for the
first one see if they complain about it
this is the society the size of the blue
zone remember this is an event so you
keep responding after you die via plane
drop and if we make this really small
it's like unplayable because you all
drop into the same like tiny pinprick of
land and that's no fun so we're just
gonna say
point oh five that's what we usually
leave it at respond time this is
important lower this as much as possible
especially you know if you care about
game play because if you raise this like
if I had a hundred seconds then you
would have to wait a hundred seconds or
whatever point in time you died during
one hundred second cycle before you
could respond again and that's no fun
leave it as low as possible the minimum
is thirty Seconds respond equipment we
usually just pick ARS you can do random
and stuff that people get stuck with you
know terrible guns so we keep it at a
our care package interval this is fun 30
seconds basic you get you know Auggie's
and all kinds of crazy stuff in there
and we'll go ahead and confirm and
double check we'll Nate shreyer you need
to move him over I'm trying to think of
and and Bo isn't citzen team - he's in
three and then bo's'n - let me make the
teams bigger we'll do ten on the team so
70 there we go
that's more like it and nate is there
trying to get as many people as we know
in to this first team here and then
everyone else who's in discord will be
on the same team and this one because we
have separate chat channels right so you
can all voice chat in the discord server
instead of having to do a via pub G
which can be a pain especially if you
have clicked to whatever thick the
hockey for for voice just gets annoying
happen to push that every time excuse me
and Nate still in oh I can move him I
didn't think about being able to move
him no you're good okay
so yeah that's true teams of five is
probably better yeah let's do that let's
do teams of five and we'll limit it to
50 there we go and hold on you guys I'm
gonna get the people that I always play
with we're gonna try to keep in the same
teams
let's see bo krypton ik will so will and
bo zombies you're gonna go to team two
put you together with cinco automatic
okay this it's filled up now so I can't
even move and where is let's see Cinco
DeMayo there's Nate okay this is gonna
be kind of wait remove this member yes
wait okay it's filling up too fast so
I'm going to make it private now just do
SS there we go and see these names here
like TMJ r WS okay
kryptonite give me one second moving you
where is Nate there we go
kryptonite you are going in this one now
we're gonna make it public again there
we go and we should be good
hey tell me will who was all in the same
team so I could put them together oh
yeah sorry it's good now the team one
and Team two I just need to know who-who
else needs to go in team two who isn't
already I want to make sure they're all
together okay who do you see that's not
in team two three or four that needs to
be I'm gonna get stream Snipes so hard
okay t bomb you remember when we play
with the circle last time how big that
circle was and we were getting sniped
all over the place that was this size so
I don't think making it any bigger is
gonna do anybody any favors at all
Willis checking right now to make sure
we're all in the same team if you guys
are watching the livestream and you want
to play with us join the disc or you can
see Ted Crimson is linking it right now
scroll up a little bit in the live chat
if you don't see it and you'll be able
to play with us live right now if you
stream tonight me good on you just I'm
gonna be so bitter what's up will
hello he needs to oh yeah I'm okay okay
one sec oh geez it's just filling up so
fast give me a sec once we're all on the
same teams it'll be easier yeah okay I
got him up maybe no it was someone who
just joined that's why I moved in Haiti
BOM you remember when we had a we had
the regular events in pub G when they
would have a hundred people all jumping
at the same space that was 0.05 0.08 you
are under estimating the size disparity
like 0.08 is actually really big
compared to 0.05 let's see here I'm
going to take arey
will it's taking you a while well well I
got a look at what's going on over here
oh he's moving them now I see alias is a
reigning God okay there we go
move to team three
oh there's so many people I see why not
I see why it's taking so long you guys
it's just because there's so many people
in here yeah well you got a you got a
hurry dude but people are getting
impatient
let's see paradox games entertainment
think that $4.99 super chat might do
just order the fantex eclipse P 350
thanks for the video help me to make my
decision and that is a great case my
friend you what's funny is that super
chair right there's like 10% of the case
cause like it's so cheap for what you're
getting I think it's one of the best
value cases honestly on the market and
that was what I said in the review of it
and it was something that I originally
when they sent me the email asking if I
wanted to review it I was just like yeah
it just looks like a slightly bigger P
300 but I was wrong
I actually saw it for the first time in
person at Computex 2018 in Taiwan and
when I saw it I immediately told the
guys I was like hey I want one of those
someone owes me I'll put a build in it
I'll make it look really good because
it's already a good-looking case to
begin with and it did not disappoint at
all it's just it's just such a clean
case for 59 bucks 60 bucks whatever you
know it's a really nice nice deal so you
picked a good case definitely I know
King Kong name Jones like whirl whirl
Psalm like the password is SS password
is or is SS just people were asking what
the Passover was for the game because I
I did because I couldn't I couldn't keep
moving people around while people were
joining like instantly are you do you
have everybody in
yeah Nick anyone can join the game Nixon
average one two three so if you want to
join you can do that
the password is SS if you want to join
lowercase s lowercase s I'll get you
into the game it's called jump mod
deathmatch there is no real mod of this
game we just call it jump mod to get
people to join it's like clickbait
basically and what's up Zachary Kelly
this is that Greg lowercase has the
lower case lower case s the lower case s
that is the password it's gonna get good
I know you guys are just sitting here
watching us stare at a screen yeah v
okay right there and yeah so that's a
will you guys here will he's popping and
he's making sure that everybody in the
discord is linked to the correct team so
we have different team chats different
channels for each team so that only
people in that team can hear themselves
talk and we lock those down so that
people without admin privileges can't
hop between teams and hear what other
people are saying kind of snoop in so
it's it's a pretty crazy process but
that's why it's taking a while once we
get it going then it's gonna be really
cool cuz you'll get to actually hear
everybody and see everything going on
how's it going well hey look
what I didn't hear anything you just
said what do you say okay okay okay
techy pocket says Willie duh duh Willie
as in what's happening is we're getting
people sorted in the discord into teams
so if you want to play with us I see you
Nick I'm gonna move you over I don't
know if dark caecus ficus how do you say
I want to move him it's dark ficus in
the in the game whoops there show no
it's weird it's not letting me unclick
you okay there we go
Ryan the password is SS
the password is SS there we go
tis the person who was asking the
question about C Zachary Kelly asked
does 140 bucks for my rx 480 sound like
a decent price to sell it at uh yeah I
mean that's that's not a bad price at
all
you could probably a little more for
that to be honest you have to feel out
the market in your area it's really
gonna depend on a location and the
demand and you'll get the sense right
away I'm 140 and my eyes isn't too bad
for that at all it's at a four gig or an
88 car though that might make the
difference so you always want to price a
little higher than you're comfortable
selling it at so if you want to sell it
for 140 put it up there for like 180 and
then then you'll be good to go
let me see
brandon is asking for the password in
the lobby me a sec password is SS there
we go
and you'd be good to go
let's see here me Meech gala whoo oh my
gosh
this is so good
what's up will ya yep that's true that's
true so all the people you're seeing in
this right now are in the discord and
they're gonna play with us live so if
you guys want to play with us basically
against us cuz all the other teams are
filled up already
but we'll switch every round then join
the discord click on that link I know
it's taking a while I'm sorry for those
200 as though watching you guys are
awesome thanks for sticking around and
if you're ready to play then again join
that discord server link and you will be
good to go what do we have here and yes
John everyone in pubs you can do custom
games let's see yeah good call tech
rooms let me go and delete that first
dream that was like it lasted for like
10 minutes and it was so messed up there
we go
video manager go ahead and take this one
off alright 7:23 p.m. time is definitely
wrong
there we go and this one is still going
good call tech crimson it is now deleted
and we're updated okay so I just tabbed
out of the game there for a second let's
see here
thank Ruby you have to remember though
that most people watching this are
watching it because they don't want to
play like why would you watch a live
stream if you wanted to play video games
so we're having to literally pull people
in who want to play and they have to
join the discord to do that so it's
taking some time do you use the lobby
FPS cap
I haven't enabled it but if it's enabled
by default then yeah I've never even
touched that let's see yeah wait till
watch the murder fest checkered bomber
you in here you're not in here
Oh disappointing my dude what's up Jason
he says I love you science studio I love
you back thanks for stopping by on the
livestream let's see techie pocket says
I only play pop G mobile will needs to
hurry herb
I see Team seven now filling up I'm
looking at the people in discord
LinkedIn Jason okay
Nexus I didn't see your comment I didn't
ignore it don't take this stuff
personally you guys get too offended
over petty stuff I did not ignore a
comment I just didn't see it and
honestly even if I did see it it's hard
to keep up sometimes with the chat so
don't take it personally what's up will
are you ready all right so is public now
and just wavered fill up here are you
gonna move me to team one okay let's see
so you guys are gonna hear the other
people in team one when we talk together
Nexus Google Nexus yeah by the way if
you guys are watching the live stream
while you're playing you might want to
mute the livestream so that you don't
hear double of me in Adelaide yep yeah
okay good we're gonna start now there
are by the way you guys listening now
that we have other people talking in the
channel if you guys if you think that
they're too loud or the games too loud
let me know I can't we call that in post
I do not know how lot it's gonna be
because I'm not actually listening to
the livestream so just let me know and
we'll see tech Crimson's totally gonna
stream tonight me I think everyone's
gonna stream snipers it's not too bad
it's like oh the sensitivity is so bad
am i playing at 60fps you can change the
delay on YouTube yeah that's sure I
could I could delay it more but I think
it's at like a 20-second delay or so
it's it's not an immediate like there
it's not like there's no delay so they
would have to anticipate quite a bit
still let's see they say they're too
soft
let me fix that turn you guys up a
little more go ahead and talk one of you
okay no that's true yeah I think the
better solution is just to use game chat
yeah oh yeah force everybody to either
make their own discord or game chat like
we can use this cord for our team but
yeah can you turn your open mic up in
game there we go
okay X all right hey Greg don't tell
them but let's land in the water they're
totally gonna hear that a make sure
nobody hears that no I'm just saying I'm
gonna change all my sensitivities for a
second because this is all like really
whacked out oh that's twice
I'm capped at 60fps while I'm streaming
and it's like the worst thing ever it
sounds so first world but it's so bad
I'm not used to streaming while playing
I usually along and the cap has dropped
every like second so bad
oh he's hiding yeah let's all go in the
forest area this like this is so laggy
Oh will there's honestly yeah there's so
you got rekt - yeah I couldn't hide
behind that tree board says take a shot
for every kill Craig gets you guys might
be disappointed Oh like I'm not bad at
the game but with this 60 yards cap
looks like minor delay here it's pretty
bad
one killing going down yummy

come right in front of me was a stretch
robe and you will know me I don't like a
minute houses see that see that for the
guy who said use full auto I just showed
you why you should never use full autos
that recoil is absolutely hideous
so there you go there's like a cemetery
of people there's so I can't control
where I'm going
they're dropping they're dropping right
on top of you
hey you good down there yeah oops I got

gotta get this red thought reign of
darkness
are you bad move already
I'm coming good shot from somewhere Wow
now I got shocked on the South dude he's
on my tree yeah no I got shuffles on the
south or the north whatever it is down
the hill
dude this game is so broken
there's two of them there's team there's
a team right behind us do we got we're
keeping needles they're right behind us
dropping on straight outside the zone
we're barely winning though I was
already wheat from out side to side you
got puck to this yes
Cody Brennen he's doing me dirty Oprah
let's see how I see on so one can kill
he's crouching right here Nate come with
us on the on the hills
dude this a case so they made the recoil
on this gun is just here yeah oh my gosh
I wonder spawned guys behind
or gimme-gimme-gimme got shot from from
outside ran outside oh no I got freaking
lit again Brandon's the savior of us all
oh I just lagged hard knock it out I
heard shots over here so hard yeah hey
guy just drop it
yeah I know I
that was weird oh do my gosh yeah
Krypton extremes knife and hard don't go
oh wow
will what are you doing well you're just
standing there well whatever 5 grand if
I had known he was gonna stand there
classic Gigi one more get get a mate you
know finish boys 21 15 15 dude how do I
get more kills than you
I feel like start though yeah I think we
should have started and stayed in those
hills up there I think I'll go ahead and
do it we'll just just in case okay I'll
put it on the I'll put it on private for
them let them know the passwords for
cases
all right so guys what did you think of
that one that was our first big excuse
me pub G deathmatch there with a bunch
of people who were watching the live
stream now bigger map area please tanker
review says random team stop stacking
the teams we like barely one there was
no stacking there if you didn't win you
just didn't do well enough and honestly
will is streaming from a Mac so he is
definitely not an advantage for us
frankly not because it was not a good
player because he's playing on a Macbook
so it really has nothing to do with with
that I think it's pretty funny though I
have my suspicions about stream sniping
but I won't accuse them of anything
bigger map please okay so people want
bigger maps so we will make it bigger
that is an easy fix so let's go down to
here let's do what trucker bomb
recommend is 2.08 and then let's switch
these back to ARS and let's actually you
know what let's do let's do random this
time so let's just do total totally
random guns or spawn time is 30 seconds
it's the lowest we can go we're gonna
make the health again 50 on the revive
revive time is one second and make the
score or 300 give me sex I'm still
editing the rules 50% it's better than
25 which is what I had it at basic 30
seconds we'll do over cast just to make
it weird there we go
okay so let me start moving people
around we'll do bigger teams this time i
CT bomb I don't know who are plus HS I'm
assuming that's somebody on our team
yeah everybody in here okay
okay cool all right oh that's right yeah
because it's private still I forgot that
I had it at private so yeah so we have
the map is slightly bigger and I think
we're good
yeah Tech reps you did a good job
irritating us so the map is bigger is
where people were complaining about
stack teams though like they're saying
that that was the reason why we won cuz
we all play together and then I said
then I told him that you're streaming
from a MacBook I'll pay I'll put my
brother on my team there we go
well at this point who was one the
complaint I'll put him on our team let's
see if he wins know his name right I
know Ryan Ryan hi
oh no no tanker reviews tanker review I
want to find him
he's gonna be on our team now sees name
no tanker doesn't play he doesn't even
play it and he's whining about stack
teams whatever I don't know who are plus
HS okay I guess I see him on the zombies
over then okay I look good yeah I think
Crazy's pretty good and he's on Team two
whoops yeah let me go before you widen
it or make it public let me go make sure
everyone's in okay
password is SS for those wondering
there we go I know that's gonna be delay
that's why I went ahead and typed it
Tech Crimson said yes landing outside
the zone was the strategy that worked
for me to take you guys all out and yeah
that's actually smart I did that one
time and I was I was I think I killed
you outside the zone I saw you trying to
do it and I was further out than you
were so I kind of screwed myself but
still so that was really interesting no
I know you guys can't see who's in the
team's when I have this overlay here but
it goes away afterwards let's see it's
one of pub G servers and I talk and you
can see tech crimson just posted the
discord and see its title of jump mod
password for pub G war mode is SS so to
get into our server type in s s all
lowercase and you'll be in and we'll
split you up in discord if you are not
in this chord you should join it because
that's how we split up teams for the
chat so we'll do one more of these
before we in the livestream just a
proof-of-concept so you guys can play
with us in the future
we won't do the livestream aspect of it
but you can play with us play with me
personally even Brian sometimes plays
will and we can have fun on pub G so
just another way for for us to all kind
of hang out together especially those
who were patreon supporters and whatnot
so you feel like actually getting
something for your money for day 4
forward 8 for 8 for play on words you a
fan of Carl Sagan by any chance I
actually had a buddy of mine did a
really cool report on Carl Sagan and
it's like the 8th grade I've always been
into astronomy and physics and stuff so
that stuff always you know interested me
anybody in that field I at least read
some what about he was relatively
prominent obviously Carl Sagan was in
there it wasn't really about the people
as much though as it was what they were
discovering and what they were writing
about their books and whatnot so yeah it
definitely is something I'm interested
in space in astronomy has always
interested me and that's when some of
the older videos on the channel actually
do focus on that which is definitely out
of character for the stuff we do now but
yeah alright I'm gonna go and make this
public and we're gonna go ahead and
finish this up
this round here so once it fills then
I'll be ready to go what's up this was
amazing see the first time we did this
we tried to you know be all controlling
and lock all the voice chats down and
everything in discord this time we
unlocked everything and everybody went
to their correct team yeah but now you
risk them switching team water that
double do that Oh No yeah it's public
now so it just filled up okay okay so
we're gonna go right now
hopefully I said everything up correctly
otherwise we're screwed okay cool
a cynical ass do you think you're gonna
be streaming pub G again in the future
I'm sure at some point yeah next week
we're gonna do a traditional after-hours
livestream you guys gonna ask me
anything related to tech or whatever I
know something about and we can talk
straight up so yeah let's see let's warp
to the nearest star Neil deGrasse Tyson
is kind of his protege cool dude yeah
I'm and I like listening like Neil
deGrasse Tyson is so easy to listen to
like he's a good speaker and and he
knows a lot about us he knows he knows
how to simplify it you know that's I try
to model my channel that way stuff that
I just learned about we're trying to
reconveyed other people I want to be
able to simplify as much as possible
because you know anybody in his or her
field can explain things in their terms
it's being able to simplify it and
explain it to the layman it's easier are
we in here with zombie civvies and tech
Crimson and all the good guys I'm
getting a migraine from this okay
zombies you know like lower your mic a
little bit you were way louder than
everyone else and sound you sound pretty
member in discord that's true and
discord am I didn't actually check how
much

stuff there string theory yeah I do a
lot of fishing on my channel quantum

way okay good all right I got my mods
