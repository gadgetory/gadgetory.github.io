already know where the RX 580 stacks up
against its current competition the RX
480 which is also an EMV card the GTX
1060 and the gtx 1070 and i have to say
based on the benchmarks that you're
about to see the 580 is a compelling
offer and an excellent value especially
compared to what we saw from previous
generations on both sides of the aisle
so in this video we're changing things
up a bit we're assuming you've already
seen the slew of benchmarks regarding
the RX 5 eighties performance and
standard resolutions and that's why in
this benchmarking video you'll see 1080p
ultra wide as the resolution of choice
which is a 21 PI nine format versus the
standard 16 by 9 aspect ratio with 1080p
1440p 4k cetera on top of that we'll be
using an R seven 1700 X rising CPU
clocked at 3.8 gigahertz paired with 16
gigabytes of 26 66 megahertz ddr4 now as
for the two graphics cards I've decided
to give the RX 480
as much for disadvantage as possible in
terms of overclocking potential just
because in this case it is a blower
style card whereas the rx 580 is just a
third-party custom cooled card from
gigabytes
Oris and gaming lineup and I have to say
this card is absolutely beautiful if
there is one thing that I have to
critique about it though it's that it's
so large it's actually like a two and a
half three slot card if you really want
to get technical with it it's not a thin
card by any means it's also not very
light so build quality is excellent it's
an excellent design thermally can
actually dissipate quite a bit of heat
coming from the RX 5 ad which actually
is a higher TDP then the standard RX 4
80 but at the same time you expect that
it's a more powerful version of the
polaris architecture now with that I do
want to say one more thing these are out
of the box just clock frequencies here I
haven't tinkered with any memory
frequencies or GPU frequency so you can
look these up they're linked in the
video description you can also find both
of these cards if you're interested in
purchasing one or the other so let's
start first with GTA 5 I always start
with this benchmark because it is so
well optimized it leverages both CPU and
GPU horsepower very well and very fair
now the first graph you're going to see
here is the frame time graph a little
context here what this is showing is the
amount of time that it takes for each
graphics card to
under every single frame over the course
of the benchmark now this may seem a bit
counterintuitive because when it comes
to FPS we want the highest number right
well frame times is essentially that
fraction flipped upside down instead of
frames per second its seconds per frame
and in this case you want the lowest
number possible which means that it
doesn't require card very much time to
render each subsequent frame now in the
case of the rx 580 it spends a majority
of its time rendering frames faster than
its 480 counterpart though around the
5000 frame both cards definitely
stuttered a bit the 580 had a little bit
more trouble seems that very exceptional
spike there in the middle and this would
actually be noticeable in real life you
would see literal stuttering in these
cases just because it's it's basically a
pause in the graphics cards ability to
render frames and that's why you see
those sharp spikes for the most part
though the trend you're looking for is a
very flat and consistent line that stays
well below I would say 25 to 30
milliseconds now this graphs counterpart
which I'm sure you've seen quite a bit
the average and minimum frame rates of
both cards the RX 580 maintained eighty
nine point eight fps almost ninety FPS
at very high settings with no AAA and no
advanced graphics signifying a 6.2
percent increase of performance in
general over the arcs 4u counterpart and
we look at the averages next up on our
list is Witcher 3 now this is a very
graphics intensive game it's why still
uses benchmark it's not going to be
picky about the CPU per se as long as
it's not something like a dual-core from
2004 if it's a quad-core and semi modern
you should be ok on the CPU side the
graphics card will be leveraged heavily
in this case now for the frame time
graph here everything looks hunky-dory
except for those very sharp spikes both
the 480 and the 580 experienced these by
the way and at similar times
interestingly enough the 160 millisecond
delay is definitely noticeable it occurs
two or three times for both cards this
is a severe stutter issue and that would
be probably the result of the ultra
preset in this case I recommend lowering
the settings even though the 580 and the
40 did very well this is something that
could be solved by lowering in-game
settings
nonetheless average and minimum frame
rates are acceptable for both cards the
rx 580 pulls ahead by 13
three four percent on average and that's
due to the fact that witcher 3 is so
graphic intensive any small change in
GPU horsepower will be amplified by a
game like this now let's take a u-turn
and look at again it's very CPU
intensive in this case city skylines
here we see the RX 580 pulling ahead up
front and this is where in the benchmark
I would assume far out from the city now
when I zoomed way into the city CPU
intensive nough sin creases and that is
why the difference between the two cards
later on the benchmark becomes very
obscure at this point the graphics card
isn't being leveraged very much at all
and that is why the frame rates are
fairly consistent the story continues
with average and minimum frame rates the
RX 580 received a 6% increase over the
480 on average though it did did
slightly lower on the minimum side this
is probably within the margin of error
though and remember because it's a CPU
intensive the 1700 X or CPU what we
leverage more in this case if we switch
the CPU to something that has a slightly
higher IPC say a 7700 K at 5 gigahertz
then we could expect a larger increase
in framerate than we do from the 480 to
the 580 lastly I wanted to benchmark a
DirectX 12 title that is optimized for
both AMD CPUs and GPUs so best-case
scenario here for ashes of the
singularity I don't know anyone who just
plays ashes do any of you play ashes I
just benchmark with it's pretty much all
it is to make sure to benchmark across
the board here the RX 580 run at about
10% more frames per second than the RX
480
there's really nothing else to say here
this is just a benchmark showing the
difference in graphics potential with a
GPU intensive benchmark now I want to
end this video on a very brief and cool
note for AMD by this point you might be
wondering why on earth of 580 even exist
if the 480 was doing just fine in the
current market in fact in some cases it
was even outperforming the 1060 while at
the same time costing less than 1060
which means that not only do you get the
better value which is been a and B
strong suits since when ever but you
also get the better performer in a few
cases not all cases but still worth
considering that's why I prefer the Arg
480 over the 1060 just you know as a
general consumer but what the 580 does
is bring you that extra 5 to 15%
performance increase it depends on the
game whether it's CPU or GPU intensive
and whether it's AMD optimized or not
for almost the same price as the 400
series lineup that is super cool of AMD
I can see it now in video releasing the
1060 Ti and attacking on a $75 premium
that standard operating procedure
admitted Green Team so I'm very
surprised that AMD hasn't decided to go
that route they've improved their
architecture and for most case are not
charging a penny more for it if you
liked this video be sure to give it a
thumbs up thumbs down for the opposite
