watch this video so this is the kind of
video where I read hate comments and we
have quite the number of them today
particularly from the AMD subreddit I'll
fill you in with context as we go
through them
brace yourselves there is quite a bit of
explicit language involved some of our
studio said he's going to make a video
about hate comments from this subreddit
can't get any more desperate reviews
than that this guy sounds like a whiny
high school girl after going through a
breakup grow the fuck up Salazar sounds
like a villain in a James Bond movie
that or a gay porn star
you're wrong and you suck yeah you're
fucking retarded butthurt little guy
it'll be okay AMD doesn't have to love
you you know that's really your parents
job the guy is retarded move on and pay
no attention to hoe who the fuck are you
the guy is a genius that video will be
watched by all the people in this forum
we'll get a top thread on here thousands
of views well played sir he claimed to
have 200,000 subs which I would suspect
would generate some decent income it's
indeed quite possible he isn't reporting
this income he I'm being accused of tax
evasion are you serious yeah it was bad
he's referring to this tweet right here
by the way a lot of these tech tubers
are young and titled brats that have
probably never done a real day's work in
their life yeah I unsubbed him for that
one tech spot already simulated
performance of the our 5 Series oh this
is the one yet check this out of course
that's what happens when against intel's
lower clocked non hyper threaded CPUs
AMD is a bit ahead in IPC so they
absolutely need to match AMD's hype
restrict and clocks atleast to get
similar performance you're right this
stuff has become one hell of a circle
jerk DD aka Tate you are correct
are you really accusing him of
slandering AMD because he didn't get a
risin sample come on dude he said it
wouldn't be better than an i5 in gaming
not in general he's referring to I think
this video right here and I still stand
by that I know the new RAM frequencies
are starting to
pick things up on the FPS side but I'm
still standing by what I said I don't
think that rising fires going to blow
the i-5 series out of the water I
actually used to quite like his videos
but over the past few months
I can't bear watching him anymore due to
his incredibly bad attitude and
unprofessionalism this last tweet of him
calling out AMD will not do him any
favors with other tech companies at all
he would do well to issue an apology and
suck up to the criticism quietly no I am
not apologizing for a tweet that I sent
yesterday butthurt studio the hue plus
incident was what introduced me to
Salazar I instantly realized what a
prick he was after he admitted the whole
problem was because of his own
carelessness wait okay so I'm a prick
for admitting that I screwed up that's
internet logic at its finest i unsubbed
late last year thought he was pretty
cool when he was small now he's a douche
can't believe how much money can change
people did he think I'm rolling in dough
Jay seems like a huge asshat Jay they're
bringing you into this man come on thank
you I watched a few of his reviews last
year when he was called science studio
the guy doesn't understand the
technology he's covering and is
spreading wrong information also let's
not forget he claimed his rx 480
destroyed one of his pcs you know that
was actually a thing right it's just a
low quality YouTube channel much like
the tech of tomorrow
wow you has a ruthless hold this into
perspective this guy has two hundred
thousand subs on YouTube alone that
means he probably earns around 30 to 50
K per month you think I'd be living in
this dump if I made 32 50k a month I
like the guy seems decent enough and
doesn't follow the trends of other
youtubers here we go same here watch the
videos and get more I don't give a fuck
vibe from him yeah I mean that's kind of
me I just don't care it hurt people's
feelings well maybe they didn't send him
an R 5 because he received an R 7 and
didn't review it
no a.m. he didn't send me any kid at all
I don't know why people are assuming
that I got a kid I didn't I got a 1700 X
from asrock they sent an engineering
sample if they had actually watched that
video they would have known that but
they didn't watch the video so they
assumed and they assumed wrong and now
they're being called out on it that'll
be interesting to read about in the
forum tomorrow
he seems like an Intel Nvidia shill who
doesn't even remember when AMD was great
if he wanted to get in AMD's good graces
he should have hiked horizon more he's
literally telling me to inflate my
benchmarks and my reviews in order to
get into Amy's good graces and this is
the AMD subreddit it may be because he
made a video saying the risin 5 will not
outperform I 5 in gaming by the way the
video is well done and he explains his
logic I agree with him I advise you all
to watch it of course you get 0 points
this is the AMD subreddit but still it's
nice possibly a bit miffed that Joker
got a press kit and he didn't Craig
anyone is fair game I'm sorry he's a
rich kid who sits home all day because
he doesn't have to work a real job like
other people see this guy clearly
doesn't follow my channel he doesn't
know that I'm in college that I've been
here for four years working on an
engineering degree and he doesn't know
that I don't live at home and he thinks
that my dad bought me tons of nice cars
well he's assuming my age under 25 least
you got that right I bet he hates
muggles salazar's Lutheran was a Harry
Potter character Dark Wizard could talk
to snakes Antonio de Oliveira Salazar
was a Portuguese fascist dictator the
name doesn't bring happy things to mind
according to this guy I suppose all x99
ships suck for gaming too yeah they suck
worse than a 67 or 70 700 K what a
fucking idiot for testing at 2400
megahertz
clearly he doesn't know anything about
risings infinity fabric mate get a life
you are an Intel fanboy your point is
flawed price always matters I use Intel
but you're you're missing the entire
point also if you use a 1070 and an i7
at 1080p
then throw your computer out please this
guy and his videos are complete garbage
go back to stepping on your motherboards
and frying components clickbait tidal
risin 5 didn't even came out and people
talk shit over it just unsubbed I used
to watch him back when he was pretty
small my didn't really like his
personality but he had decent case
reviews but I just couldn't help but get
irritated by his outro every time if you
hate everything about life to select
this video I don't know came off as
pretty condescending too bad now that
he's gotten bigger
seems like he's gotten worse well on
that bombshell if you liked the video be
sure to give it a thumbs up
was down for the opposite or if you hate
everything about life be sure to click
the subscribe if you haven't already
stay tuned for a lot more content like
this per se but just more PC related
content this is Salazar studio thanks
for laughing with us
