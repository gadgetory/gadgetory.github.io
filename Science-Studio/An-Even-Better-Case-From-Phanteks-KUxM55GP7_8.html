sending us to Computex 2019 what's going
on everyone we were here at the fan tech
suite for Computex 2019 and we've got a
really cool case we're gonna focus a
dedicated video on because I think you
guys are gonna really like this one from
both a value perspective and a
functional perspective so this is a
familiar chassis it's the P 400 more
particularly the P 408 and the a stands
for you guessed it air flow so you can
see this entire front panel is basically
one big a metal mesh panel and they were
telling me how technically difficult
this was to do not only to hole punch a
curved surface like this and to have
these very fine you can see specific
cuts there that that kind of wrapped
with the contours of the chassis so this
is I believe around 50 to 55 percent
hole punches so it's going to be a
pretty porous I know it looks a little
blocked off here the white paint is a
little thicker so that might reduce the
porosity just a bit more but because
it's such a large surface sir you see
the entire front panel come from this
side here cough so you can see straight
on literally the entire front panel here
is one big metal mesh panel so even if
it is rather restrictive the entire
thing is going to a lot air to be pulled
in so you stick two or three fans up
front and we expect excellent airflow
capabilities and we'll be sure to review
this in a dedicated video talking about
thermal performance how porous it
actually is so stay tuned for that you
can see internally here it's the same P
400 you guys know and love with a few
tiny changes at the rear so if you want
that native vertical graphics card
support that's been pretty popular as of
late there are no longer there's little
frame little bars that would normally
you know have to be cut if you want to
use like a cable mod kit or whatever
like a vertical bracket
fan tech sells their own that will work
with this and you can remove this entire
rear PCIe slot cover window and replace
it with a vertical kit that they have
and that you can actually buy that kit
for like 30 or 40 bucks it's it's pretty
cheap and the riser cable is built very
well you know individual sleeving so
it's very sturdy in the
run I thought you guys would really like
this one because something I haven't
said yet coming in at $69.99 really good
price it's actually cheaper than the
original P 400 which is pretty
incredible and this is this is a this is
a contender folks
I can't wait to building it and test out
that airflow that they have been touting
so much you can see this one here it's a
more expensive model by about 20 bucks
so 89 us for this one and it's gonna
come with three of these addressable RGB
fans and then you're gonna have that
built-in RGB controller you can control
it all really by the case itself so it's
all nice and integrated and yeah they've
just got a just blinged out in there
looking nice and fancy you can see in
this one they do have that vertical
bracket and it's recessed actually quite
a bit from the tgd left panel so
shouldn't expect too detrimental
performance here thermally for the
graphics card so looking really good I
like especially the cheaper version
because $70 for a case like this is
super competitive it's a competitive
space to begin with but when you have
this much functionality and you have the
backing of the original P 400 which I
thought was a really good case to begin
with this is exciting so that's why we
dedicated a video like this to it I hope
you guys have enjoyed this coverage
another video from fantex is coming out
very soon we're gonna show you guys all
the rest of the stuff in the suite
because he will have been facing this
little corner right here and the room is
very big thanks for watching we'll catch
the next one
this is science studio thanks for
learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
