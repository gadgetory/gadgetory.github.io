troubleshooting your PC I recommend
drinking a cup of coffee have an energy
drink something along those lines now
this isn't a sponsored spot on being
dead serious
drink something like this before you
begin troubleshooting because you could
be doing this for quite a long time hey
everyone welcome to another video on the
how to playlist this one hits close to
home because I've been following the
channel for quite a while you know that
every now and then I do have something
go wrong at some point somehow with one
of my PC's this one right here is no
exception this is an ITX pcs boarding an
i-5 7600 k 16 gigs of RAM GTX 1060 and a
fractal I think it's a 400 450 watt sfx
power supply all packed into the fractal
node 202 this is a classic example of a
PC that will not post now that word is
actually an acronym it's not just
something we float around
it means power on self test it's a
checklist of sorts at the PC run sir
when you first power it on to make sure
all the components are functioning
properly before you boot into your
operating system this video will focus
primarily on the post issue though I
will briefly mention what you should do
if your monitor isn't receiving any
signal from your PC especially if the
computer appears to be functioning
properly these are just scenarios I
imagine a few first-time builders will
find themselves in at some point maybe
you receive a do a part or you just
didn't wire something correctly I also
recommend checking out the link in this
video's description tied to a Tom's
Hardware forum post it's a beautiful
breakdown of what you should do if your
PC is not posting or if your system
won't boot in general no power or if
you're not receiving any video output to
your monitor right so for the sake of
time the length of this video because it
could be hours long if I want to address
every possible scenario I'm going to
assume that you kind of already know
what you're doing so you plugged
everything in correctly maybe this isn't
your first rodeo or you've used a
YouTube channel like my own or website
to help help you along the way as you
build your PC I'm going to assume that
you've wired everything correctly and
that you're receiving power from the
wall that you haven't tripped a break or
anything like that so the basics you got
that so in most troubleshooting cases
especially if you do know to some extent
what you're doing the specs themselves
aren't going to matter as long as you're
using the proper CPU for the motherboard
the proper Ram it's DDR 3 or ddr4
videocard that's plugged in correctly
and a power supply's delivering enough
power to even boot the computer in the
first place which usually isn't going to
require a lot of power then the specs
really don't matter now it just comes
down to what component if it's a
hardware issue is causing the PC to
either boot loop or just not turn on
period in the case of this PC here the
computer will turn on for about five
seconds turn back off and then cycle
again and again and again repeat the
exact same thing the first thing that I
recommend you do ultimately depends on
whether or not this is the first time
you've booted up this PC so if your pcs
been running for days months years it
doesn't matter and now all of a sudden
won't turn on the first thing I
recommend you do is clear your CMOS what
that will do is reset all of your BIOS
settings back to the stock
configurations that your motherboard had
when it came out of the box let's say
you had an overclock of 4.3 gigahertz on
your CPU and a V core of 1.3 that might
have been good a year ago but now thanks
to the degradation of technology is just
what happens over time let's see if you
might require a bit more voltage it's
not receiving that required voltage when
you first turn your PC on it will
continue cycling and if your
motherboards are considerably old board
then the BIOS won't reset itself newer
boards will typically warn you after a
few cycles and say hey we just reset to
default settings because something in
your BIOS was forcing this PC to trip
and turn off and on again but older
motherboards aren't usually going to do
that for you
so I recommend clearing your CMOS you'll
find some kind of jumper at the bottom
your board your motherboard manual will
tell you how to do that some newer
boards will have just a button you can
click to clear the CMOS and reset the
BIOS now assuming the opposite case so
this is the first time you've ever
turned your PC on and you're getting a
boot loop or your system will not post
in general I recommend starting first
with system RAM remove one dim change
the slots don't occupy all the slots
just put one stick around in if it still
doesn't work try each slot you might
have one two three dead slots if you
have four slots on your board or if you
have an x2 9 9 X 99 your X 79 board you
could have seven dead slots in one good
slot it is possible for peace of mind
sake I recommend taking one stick trying
it in each of those slots and kind of
narrowing down the possibility of a
system Ram error remember it could be
the DIMM itself or the slot itself on
the motherboard either as possible I'll
tell you right now the reason why this
you see wooden post is because one of
the RAM slots on this board the asrock
fatalities ii to 70 gaming board which i
reviewed right here by the way died on
me randomly just a fluke thing now so I
had both of these modules installed and
all of a sudden just one time after
benchmarking the PC wouldn't turn back
on I decided to remove one of the
modules kept one in try each slot I
found out that the outside slot was dead
and the way that I confirm that it
wasn't the module itself that was bad
was I tried a whole nother stick of RAM
just a completely different stick from a
different manufacturer and that would
also not work on the outside slot but it
worked perfectly fine on the inside slot
so through the process of elimination
you can figure out which slot is that if
that is the case alright so if we assume
a system Ram is not the issue we're
getting the exact same errors on our PC
then the second thing I recommend you
swap out or remove to just test for the
sake of testing is the graphics card
remove the graphics card if you have an
IG P you plug the HDMI cable into the
motherboard directly to remove the
graphics card as a potential issue if
you get the exact same error again then
you know that it's not the graphics card
and if you get a post or even if you
don't have an eye GPU that you just turn
the computer on anyway and the computer
doesn't give you some kind of error code
or doesn't boot loop then chances are
the graphics card is the problem if
you've deduced that the graphics card is
what is causing the boot loop you can
either try moving that graphics card to
a different slot on the board maybe it's
just the PCI slot that's giving you an
issue you could also check to see if you
have the cables from the power supply
plugged in correctly either six or eight
pin or both if you're not getting enough
power to the graphics card and that can
be a reason why you're not getting any
signal to your monitor and if both of
those fail then it might just be a PCB
issue in which case just return the
thing and buy another cart because
you're not going to be able to fix these
really tiny things on the board itself
now at this point if you're still
getting a PC boot error or you're not
getting a post period then be prepared
to get your hands dirty because you're
going to have to virtually disassemble
what you've already assembled in your
case this is why we recommend building
your PC outside the case first to make
sure that your components are working
because if you have to start dissecting
everything and troubleshooting
individual components it's going to be a
lot easier to do if everything is not
already assembled in your case now I
recommend verifying that your CPU is
seated properly I've actually run into
this issue a few times myself especially
with ex
9 X 299 CPUs those are pretty large
sockets the CPUs themselves are large as
well and if you get any sort of improper
pin contact then your PC will likely not
post so remove the CPU cooler from your
build also remove the CPU from the
socket depending on to give an LG or PG
a layout most AMD boards will have a pga
layout so you can check the pins
physically on the CPU make sure that
none of those are bent you want proper
contact remember if you have an LGA
board usually with Intel then you can
check the pins physically in the
motherboard make sure that none of those
are bent if they are I have a video
right here that should kind of help you
out I guess I mean you can try your best
worst case you can go ahead and RMA it
but if you can fix it yourself I mean to
save you save you time long run you want
to wait as long to have that bright and
shiny new PC up and running
once you've ensured that the pins are
not bent go ahead and reseat the CPU
into the motherboard socket reseat the
CPU cooler atop the CPU and then try
booting again it could just be as simple
as removing the see-through from the
socket and reinserting it may be that
tiny little movement change is the
difference between a post and no post
and that is actually something I've
experienced as well literally removing
the CPU inserting it back into the
socket for whatever reason fixes the
post issue now at this point there's
really only three or four other
components in the system we can try
testing and troubleshooting from just a
general hardware standpoint to determine
which of these is preventing our PC from
posting I don't recommend starting with
the power supply I'll discuss that later
and also you can kind of narrow down if
it's a drive issue or not because if
your SSD is there's dead let's just say
it just died randomly most of the time
it's not going to write your PC from
turning on you're going to get a post
and your bios's either going to tell you
that hey we can't read this drive or
it's going to tell you that there is no
boot drive present and it's just going
to keep cycling to your BIOS over and
over and over so if it's a drive issue
that's usually what will happen if it's
a hard drive and you have your OS on a
hard drive oftentimes it'll happen if
your hard drive starts failing is it'll
boot up maybe for 10-15 seconds you
might even get into Windows or whatever
operating system you're running and then
maybe it'll crash after that it with a
blue screen of death that could just be
because your disk is spinning fast
enough or it's just not spending period
so dry of troubleshooting is a bit
different most of the time a drive is
not going to prevent your PC from
turning on in the first place you could
check again to make sure that you've put
an adequate amount of thermal paste
between your seat
it's cooler though even if you don't put
any cooler at all atop the CPU and you
just try to turn the thing on usually
I'll get a post and your PC might even
stay on for a while if it's just going
to throw a throttle hardcore down to
like you know 200 megahertz or so that
shouldn't Alton Utley prevent the PC
from posting in general even if you hit
T Junction and pass T Junction you'll
still get a post and it should still run
for a few seconds at least so I wouldn't
recommend going through the whole
trouble like swapping CPU coolers I
really don't think that's necessary for
scenario like this at this point we've
narrowed it down to just our motherboard
and our power so remember this this PC
here there was just a dead RAM slot but
if you're still having issues and you've
run through the previous mention steps
and you've also have been kind of
running through the checklist on the
Tom's Hardware forum then all you have
left are the motherboard and the power
supply as potential hardware causes I
recommend starting with a power supply
first because it's just more
straightforward you can either take a
voltmeter and test each of your
connection to all your peripherals make
sure that proper power is being
delivered to each of these peripherals
that could take a lot of time though and
you have to verify you know which
voltage reading is on which pin it just
gets complicated what I recommend doing
is removing this power supply and going
to Best Buy Micro Center just buying
another power supply online if you have
to and testing that power supply in the
system if your PC boots then you've
basically concluded that the power
supply you had in there was already dead
not delivering enough power to one of
your peripherals but if your PC is
posting but not sending any signal to
your monitor then you can assume in most
cases that your power supply is ok you
can still swap it out just for peace of
mind sake but if you're getting a post
and no signal then your power supply is
more than likely ok the last thing in
our checklist then is the motherboard
and at this point all I can really say
is best of luck troubleshooting this
thing you've already narrowed down the
fact that your RAM slots are functioning
properly and that if you have an LGA
board you don't have any bent pins in
the motherboard socket then you're
really not gonna be able to troubleshoot
much else on this board you can verify
that the PCI slots aren't dead but
that's why I told you to move the video
cord from the top slot maybe to the next
16x lot but that's really it you could
try removing the HD audio cable you
could try removing the USB 3.0 cable
most of the time those aren't going to
trip your entire PC and prevent it from
turning on it's difficult to
and trying a new motherboard because
that you can't just buy anywhere you can
buy those at micro Sun or few other
stores but for the most part in your
city you're not going to have just a
store you could go to to buy another
motherboard to try troubleshooting with
which means that you're going to have to
order one online more than likely and
completely rebuild your PC some other
board is like underneath everything else
in your build now that if you've never
Devery thing else down and you're
confident that it's not your graphics
card you've plugged all these components
into other pcs verify that they all work
properly then yeah it's probably going
to be a motherboard issue and even if
it's not worst case you swap everything
out and you still get an issue at least
you know that it's not the motherboard
so the old one you had is good just
return the newer one at this point there
are a plethora of reasons why your PC
couldn't be turning on just reasons that
I would say are kind of stupid for most
of us especially if we've been building
pcs for quite a while it could just be
as simple as your power supply switch
not being turned on and wondering why
you're not getting any power period it
could be as simple as maybe you plug the
power LED header into the power switch
header something simple like that so
you're pushing the power button on your
case and you're not getting any power
because you wire that lead into the
wrong header on the motherboard it could
be as simple as maybe you plug the VGA
cable and upside down or you plug the
VGA cable into the EPS 8 pin cable up
top and the motherboard it could be as
simple as maybe you didn't see the
graphics card properly into the PCIe
slot it could be as simple as you didn't
push the RAM module all the way into the
slot on the motherboard I've done that
personally so check all the simple
things as well you can check those
before you run to any of the serious
troubleshooting steps up front again if
you're confident that's why I move on to
the bigger troubleshooting measures but
check the simple stuff to you know keep
it simple and and don't work harder than
you need to so the most common issues
are the simplest ones most often and I
would say that you know checking all
your connections up front is a good
thing to do again though if you've
checked all of your connections cleared
your CMOS made sure that all of these
components work outside of this PC and
other pieces but they don't work in this
one it could be I don't know maybe you
just have a standoff that's like
shorting out something on your
motherboard if the list goes on
I do recommend checking out the link in
this video's description of the Tom's
Hardware forum post it is a very
informative I would say it's way more
detailed in this video
this one is just kind of me talking
about some personal issues that I've run
into when it when I build pcs some super
simple things maybe you have something
that's more complicated like a dead RAM
slot but start with RAM and start with
your graphics cards the two easiest
things to remove also remember clear
CMOS first and foremost if you're not
getting a post and check your basic
connections if you liked this video or
at least appreciate the breakdown be
sure to give us them a thumbs up it lets
me know that I'm doing a decent job I
appreciate that be sure to click the
