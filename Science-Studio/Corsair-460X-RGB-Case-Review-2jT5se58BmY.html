Corsair 460 X RGB the RGB meaning that
ships with three RGB capable fans as
well as an integrated RGB controller all
that is up top here we'll go through
that in a second but my opinions of this
case really haven't changed much since
my initial review of the Corsair 400 C
which you can check out in a card right
here it's fairly old video but most of
what I said still stands and I say that
because the two cases in their
dimensions are nearly identical I don't
think there's really anything that they
change up significant between the two I
do which I still had the 400 C so we can
just do a side-by-side comparison but
pretty much anything that that I praised
in that video still applies here and
there are also a few other things
obviously the tempered glass side panel
as well as the front panel now make this
case you know have a bit more sex appeal
than the original 400 C hat although the
forward sees you know opening window
kind of like a door was a pretty cool
feature but I'd much rather trade that
out for tempered glass that's the end
thing right now and if I had to if I had
to compare this to other cases that
built in I would say this is probably
third in my order of favorite mid tower
cases in terms of looks the first being
the NZXT s340 elite the second being the
fantex P 400 tempered glass Edition and
the third being the 460 X so let's talk
first about the positives and there are
a number of them it's the reason why I
chose the course they're 460 X for my
first ever AMD risin PC build I left
everything in here to show you what the
finished product would look like that's
you know that's the big thing I was
always concerned about when I was first
looking at PC cases what is it all going
to look like when it's all said and done
and despite the you know I would say
kind of clashing color schemes here with
the red and white black pretty much
complements everything it's the only
color you can get this case in currently
but you're not gonna have a problem with
if you go with a purple and green same
black still going to look okay and then
that's why a lot of case manufacturers
choose black first off and then if they
have an up demand then we move on to the
white side as well the first thing I
notice is plenty of support up in the
front here there's a good bit of space
between the shroud which is completely
removable it comes in two pieces it's a
bit of a pain to disassemble and
reassemble but it does come out it's
exactly the same of
I was talking about with a 400 C in that
older video but you have space up here
for a 120 140 to 40 to 80 or even three
hundred and sixty millimeter AIO with
room to spare down below and above you
know that you always have these these
little things on the bottom and top here
where the fluid moves around the
radiator that kind of extend that height
a bit but you have you know full-on
compatibility for 360 mil in the front
here and you can just mount those to the
three integrated fans this is in this
case here there are GB you can also work
up top there isn't as much space up top
at but you do have kind of a frontward
juxtaposed mounting system so if you
wanted you could just put a couple fans
up here or you could actually put
something like a 240 up top but you'll
be covering up your motherboard a bit
just because there isn't much of a
clearance between the top of the
motherboard and the top of the tower now
just behind the radiator you'll find
three large rubber grommets good for
cable managing always good to see a mid
tower case it can be a bit difficult to
get those cables routed properly and
efficiently in a mid-sized Tower but
that's there's a whole other story to
this case behind the scenes literally on
the backside now you'll see that soon
but from the front I mean if you really
take your time you can make this look
clean you also get a cutout in the
basement down below throughout your your
graphics card eight pin or six pin
whatever you got going on down there it
is a bit off-centered unless you have a
very short graphics card maybe something
like an R 9 Fury nano or a short you
know 750ti something like that then your
cables going to have to kind of stretch
over
you could also route it through the
grommets in the back here just depends
on on what you think looks good and your
build you'll also have a few cutouts
down below one large one good for
primarily the HD audio cable that's
really about it I was kind of
disappointed that I had to route the
front i/o connectors through one of the
large rubber grommets I would I would
like to have seen another cutout down
below strictly for the front IO
connectors now if you want to be really
weird and quirky you could actually fit
some server motherboards a ATX in here
you might be covering up the rubber
grommets here to the right but I don't
be kind of weird to put in a server
board in a case like this most of the
time you're not wanting to just show
those off through a tempered glass panel
but you can do that that's the perk
having a very flat interior here you
don't have any grooves impeding
motherboard extensions if they are
required there are seven PCI slots at
the back of the case and just above that
you have a single 120 millimeter fan
mount with some room to spare you can
slide that that fan vertically up and
down just according to how you want to
configure things you could also barely
just barely fit a 120 rad up here so if
you have a water-cooled card now a i/o
style then you can make that work here
but you'll be cutting it very close
don't don't buy any read it's super
bulky because it will not fit it's just
too narrow
one other tasteful feature course is
included in there for 60 X it's this
arrangement of cutouts here good for any
screw driver you know when you want to
get to these PCI slots here at the back
sometimes it's a little difficult to
angle it this way sometimes they have
them cut out in the back but that
extends the length of the case so what
they've done is included the screws on
the inside but they've made it easier to
access those screws if you want to
remove some covers and insert in a Wi-Fi
card or just your graphics card
something like that you can just slide
your screwdriver through these cutouts
here and access those screws directly
which is it's just a cool extra feature
that I think is a it's nice that they
didn't overlook because that's that's a
pain and a lot of other cases that I
built in something else I did want to
show you the front of the 460 X you
don't only get a tempered glass panel on
the left side but you also get one in
the front and that's good for either
variant of the 468 the RGB edition or
just think they have a red version so
the fans are only set to a red LED color
this panel is also removable by the way
but because you have a tempered glass
panel you can see straight through the
thing and it does look very cool check
out those accents and if you're worried
at all about dust and you know how the
460 ex handles that you see our panels
are starting to come off here these
screws are very long by the way they go
through the front panel and into the the
chassis main compartment the Corsair has
done a great thing with the dust
prevention here they have this panel
that is it's literally a dedicated panel
on the board and it slides off very
easily it just clips on and clips off
not to be weird or anything this is
probably one of the smoothest just best
feeling dust filters I've ever seen it's
very fine it's magnetic mesh is very
well built it's good to see
some of the finer details were very
closely paid attention to and down below
we have our lighting control unit on the
far right here you'll have animation
button you can cycle through fading in
and out blinking I even have the colors
fade between one another in the middle
here is your rate button control how
fast at which that animation occurs and
then the far left is your I believe this
is just the brightness control in turn
things on and off so at the far left but
you can just play around with all three
you'll get used to it very simple to do
and if you're like me you just set it to
one color and you just kind of leave it
there right here you've got a reset
switch good see a dedicated one of those
hard drive led headphone jack microphone
jack and then two USB 2.0 ports and then
this power button here probably one of
the smoothest feeling power buttons you
know some of them like really clicking
really loud some of them feel very
mechanical this is just this is the
sweet spot folks right here oh yeah now
here is where things get dicey this is
the little one major pain about the 460
X and it keeps me from from D me SD best
mid tower case on the market if they had
to figure it out and I think I have a
simple solution to this but it's a
little too late for it now if they
figured this out this would be one of
the best cases period but it only ranks
third and you can kind of see why it's a
mess back here and let me tell you I put
a lot of thought into cable management
you guys seen more than likely this
video right here cable management is a
passion of mine I like to open up the
backside of my case and see everything
nice and neatly organized but that's
impossible here it is straight up
impossible the Corsair force 460 X is
one of the worst cases when it comes to
cable management period and there's a
simple reason for why that's the case
using the other definition of case of
Medicine's course there did not make the
460 X wide enough and it was the exact
same issue that plagued the 400 C so
they made a barely enough room for a 120
in the front and then of course once you
get past the motherboard tray all you've
got left is about I would say that's
around half an inch and that's too
that's that's not enough
you want about three quarters of an inch
to an inch of lead weighed between the
motherboard tray and the right side
panel in order to have a
a nice and pleasant cable management
experience you do not get that here on
top of that you've got a lot of things
that are that are popping out look the
distance between the SSD trays and the
rear panel is literally negligible
there's like no space at all between
this and the panel so you know with how
easy course there's made it to you know
insert SSDs and even to remove hard
drive trays things like that you really
don't have any room to store cables and
if you're not using anything other than
a fully modular power supply with custom
sleeves and custom length cables going
to have a badge on you'll have a lot of
bolts here at the bottom more than
likely I have about probably half an
inch of voltage here at the bottom and
it's pretty much good up top but that's
because there's nothing up top so just
this is something that they'd plagued
the 400 see it's still playing in the
460 X if cable management huge concern
over areas you have a ton of cables a
ton of peripherals to put into your case
then I recommend stepping up to the 570
X which is kind of like the 460 X's old
brother it's a bigger case bigger
chassis it's also longer so you'll have
a lot of room for other things but this
is this is about as compact as you can
get with the mid tower case without just
plan up not being able to insert your
power supply and make the cables fit in
the back I mean just look at how little
space I have between the edge of my
power supply and the front of my hard
drive tray so if you want to go to hard
drive in the 460 X or the 400 C for that
matter
you better not choose a power supply any
longer than this one right here I know
I'm kind of playing the roles captain
hindsight here granted I knew this was
going to happen because I already
experienced this for the 400 C so it
seems like I'm being a bit rough on the
case but I have to be completely honest
with all of you because if you buy this
case and figure out that it's going to
be a pain to build in you're going to
come back and need say why didn't you
say that so I've got to say it because I
felt the same way about it it's nothing
that I can really hide this point the
building process is a major pain now it
will pay off in the end in the sense
that everything's gonna look super slick
and super compact the way it should in a
midsize case but it's going to be rough
it's going to be tough and it's going to
require some skill to get those cables
in just the correct places to make that
back panel slide on the way it needs to
and even then it still probably won't
slide on the way it needs to in the
looks department I think it's a 10 out
of 10 I think they nailed it here I'm
glad they didn't really change much of
the aesthetic design from the 400 seat
because it was already a good-looking
case in the price department I think
it's very competitively priced no
complaints here it's actually very
similar to its other tempered glass
counterparts but in the building
experience Department which a lot of
people heavily weigh when considering a
new case it's like a six out of ten and
that's a conservative estimate it all
really comes down to whether or not you
have the patience and mine was wearing
very very thin I have a 460 X link in
the video description check it out if
you haven't already let me know if you
have this case and what your thoughts
are or if you're considering this or one
of its close competitors be sure to give
this video a thumbs up it's dotted with
cool thumbs down for the opposite click
