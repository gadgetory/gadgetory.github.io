people who mistake it to mean double the
physical core count as in if an i7 has
four cores and hyper-threading it has
eight effective course right I mean even
hardware monitor sees eight threads in
so do most games so why aren't we seeing
double the compute power because hyper
threading doesn't magically increase
core count that's why my i7 6700 K still
has 4 physical cores period the logical
core count increases but that in terms
of what we physically see if we study
the die of the CPU would be as far as it
goes
one type earth reading explained in four
minutes or less minute science
hyper-threading is simply a proprietary
multi-threading process by which adept
schedulers interact with compute data in
a more efficient way to parallelize
processes in simple terms it allows the
cpu scheduler to more appropriately
allocate data to be processed by logical
cores two of which comprise a single
physical core logical cores are a
computer's way of replicating certain
aspects of a CPUs architecture by
implementing hyper threading on a single
core two logical cores are detected by a
modern operating system and data is
streamlined in such a way to benefit
from this duplication when large chunks
of information are fed down a pipeline
the scheduler in charge will more
appropriately divide data between the
two logical cores in an effort to
maximize productivity so here's the
trick since only one core governs both
logical cores only one pipeline at a
time can send information through to be
processed you would need two physical
cores to process data simultaneously I
make that very clear right here
the catch is with the scheduler now
seeing a fork in the road it can hunt
for the next data stream in the sequence
for lc2 while sending information down
LC 1 by the time LC 2 data reaches the
process point LC 1 data has already been
executed in a scenario without
hyper-threading data won't always be
prepared in time these animations happen
almost instantaneously in the real world
but if information isn't prepared by the
scheduler quick enough the pressures on
because only one logical Corps exists
per physical core the scheduler can't
efficiently prepare data while it's
sending data resulting in delays
bottlenecks and even noticeable lag
watch this video for a visual
representation of that so
hyper-threading doesn't increase core
count it just tricks the scheduler into
thinking that the physical core in
question has twice its architectural
pipelines a core i5 6400 has four
physical cores which can all process
information simultaneously but in the
event that too much information is being
fed to all four pipelines
things can slow down and the scheduler
can be overloaded with information
waiting to be processed but in the case
of the core i7 6700 K the same number of
physical cores exists only with the
added benefit of a more efficient
scheduler which appropriately divides
reorders and sorts information down to
logical cores if the data stream is
light then both processors will compute
about on
or with each other and hyper-threading
will go unneeded however in the case of
heavy workloads hyper-threading can come
in very handy it reduces the number of
stalls and increases overall efficiency
which is why CPUs equipped with
hyper-threading generally sell for a
higher price than their non
hyper-threaded counterparts all other
things equal so the next time you're on
the hunt for a new processor ask
yourself whether or not your personal
workload will benefit from
hyper-threading assuming you're choosing
between an i5 without it and an i7 with
it all you do is play video games in
your PC this video right here will
answer that question for you you like
this video be sure to give it a thumbs
up give it a thumbs down if you feel the
complete opposite and subscribe if you
haven't already for more interesting
