already laughs we're about to be live
now
now we're alive I think we're live okay
and this is it so you're gonna see
yourself delayed oh you know this you've
done the twitch thing but I'm seeing my
special guest is my wife Lisa is here
with us and you can typically find her
on twitch at shifty studio that's your
name right that would be really bad okay
your name wrong why team if it's a
little loud or a little quiet I'm sure
it's probably the quiet side for some
reason the mic that we usually have
running into the camera doesn't work
when we stream to the capture card so we
are having to use the sound board with
our b1 and it's kind of off to the side
here I didn't put it in the best
position so it's probably favoring my
voice a bit more which means you have to
speak up
all right now we did it all right guys
all right can I say hello to Stan I saw
we have a son in Chad we have a son
someone said hey Dad yeah hello Greg
Oh Bob Gunderson guten nacht oh yeah hi
I'm gonna get serious very soon with
regards to my German I feel bad cuz like
I can't communicate with like much of
her family at all like your sister
speaks good English and her husband does
and that's she tries about it yeah I
mean like they're so much better than I
am with German and like they're a lot
better English speakers and your mom is
so it's you know it's good to be able to
communicate with some of them but like
your mom is like obviously really
important and and so being you know just
solely an English speaker it really
sucks when I'm over there so it's really
cute if you try to speak with her it's
Spanish
yeah yeah my Spanish is like super
broken like it's this is so bad you know
like that's like the much my heritage so
like I'm supposed to know how to speak
it but my you know it's just my dad
never used it very much growing up and
so I always never taught it at home so
you know the extent which I know Spanish
was like 10th grade Spanish class and
then I took a college Spanish class in
high school and
was pretty three disastrous but okay by
the extent it
someone said say something in Spanish I
look all my stuff huh I feel like it's
probably just bad news yeah you have a
Spanish last name - you know my last
name
no it's Italian no no I have but yeah
you guys me what is this what is this
tech process he says can i have a shout
out tech pro days oh I see snazzy left
what's going on snazzy Quinn good see
out in my day I was seeing I watched
part of your one of your live streams
with respect to the to the MacBook Air
and the 12-inch MacBook actually I
wanted to tell you so when I went and
bought bought all those Apple products
originally in one of my first Apple
videos that the 12-inch MacBook was the
first one that I bought and I ended up
giving that to my sister for Christmas
which like that's probably the most
expensive thing I've ever gotten to any
of my siblings ever technically I mean
it was a used MacBook at the time like I
had used it for about a year but I
wanted to move back to I don't know if I
had them know I didn't have the MacBook
Pro then I think I went to an XPS 13 or
I was like can I try to yoga 910 and XPS
like I was kind of with Windows again
and and then I switched back to MacBook
Pro cuz I really like Final Cut Pro and
that's what I mean she's used Mac her
whole life so you know laptop why she's
using MacBook so so now I'm giving her
my MacBook Pro what you sitting over
there it's been in the box like nobodies
you stayed it's like proposing again for
me so she has bazinga is always bazinga
$100 C which at my D I'm pretty sure
YouTube's gonna like kief that like up
there the whole time they sought it no I
know
you gonna have to take out for dinner
yeah I think you're supposed to do this
on the DL dude now she's gonna make me
take her out to a proper hundred dollar
dinner oh yeah we never we never eat out
we never do anything like that so that's
that's very very appreciated that's way
more than oh my gosh Thanks and she's
he's asking where Pepsi is and she's we
just got bed furniture so I'm pretty
sure she's sleeping under the bed like
our bedroom is smaller than this room
which is like the office it's only a two
bedroom apartment so and that one's the
master which for some stupid reason the
master is smaller than the other bedroom
it's okay you have a better office then
yeah a little more space in here and
like this is like where we like I just
wanna make money so it's kind of
important that I have space for that but
we just got a bunch of furniture for our
bedroom finally he's we've been sleeping
on a box spring and mattress for a long
time without any proper like dressers or
anything and so now that we have all
that in there she's been sleeping under
the under the bed cuz it's like her
little fortress she's asleep on the
little cat tree I bought her like it's a
pretty tall cat tree actually about 6 7
feet thanks to hang out with us yeah
okay yeah I don't know where she is at
the moment but she's she's somewhere
soon actually somewhere close
Pepsi girl Pepsi usually if you just
tell her you got chicken she'll run in
here yeah I don't want to do that cuz
then I got to get up and actually give
her a chicken or she'll get in dinner
she get pretty upset yeah she loves
chicken
go faster says you and your wife or no
he says your wife should build a PC she
actually could file some built a PC a
while back in the fantex p3 50x that
video is on channel so you can go back
and watch that if you want but she'll
also be building one here very soon the
in the be quiet dark bass 801 dark bass
801 yeah pretty sure that's it and write
it right outside and so we're gonna be
doing kind of like a sponsored thing
with be quiet for that video but we have
like a really cool black and orange
skiing obviously if you go be quite I
have to do black and orange to some
extent so just mine and we work closely
with gigabyte on this one so the card
like the graphics card we're gonna turn
that vertical and that's God that's like
a black shroud with orange accents we
have black and orange or I am like I
think it'll look really good the only
thing is I only have black cables I
don't have black and orange cable
so but she's gonna be totally hands-on
with this one I'm not gonna tell her
anything and she's just gonna do it and
then I'll kind of critique it oh yeah he
went to judge my cable management you're
gonna be so bad I try so hard how we try
my best
yeah and yeah you do well I mean she
built she probably built her first like
legit gaming PC before I ever built my
first one uh-huh so because she was
gaming you know yeah the game work at
one point I wanted to have a PC I
couldn't afford a much expensive ones I
had to build myself right Ethan Hinkle
says Lisa is Greg I once dated oh yeah I
see that I see that Ethan he's not I
feel like behind closed doors she'd
probably tell you that I haven't but I
know if he eats my can I can be pretty
uptight like I can be like I get I'm not
stressed out but like I take things
really seriously sometimes and I
shouldn't like that's like I guess the
extent of that thing is writing over
there
hey Lisa I noticed the room is much
cleaner whenever you that's true dude I
clean every day
I tried someone no dude you don't really
clean this room they don't come in here
very much
oh I come here with the walk complete oh
yeah the vacuum is she vacuumed Sofia
but nobody sees a fourth and she does
dust if she does everything I never dust
like it to me that's just a waste like
you're gonna dust and I'm just gonna
show back up like a week later and
interesting yeah that's what you have to
do that stinks there's not like a dust
room it's like a dust room like a like a
dust repellent like somebody can just
spray on a surface this doesn't
accumulate like some like slippery like
spray maybe you come with an air blower
and then you blow it away why don't we
invented that yet slippery dust like
dust spray you know so much money we
should do that and you give it I don't
know how to do that so no yeah
I have something in my but we have to
talk this off-camera
oh oh yeah yeah we don't want yelling
our ID yeah I am
let's see here J our captain a $5 stupid
shot my dude happy to see you two in the
same room Congrats
thank you very much for that yeah we
don't hang out much in the same room I
had to drag her in here she weighed you
I'm like you go live hey there's Pepsi
Gary up that's yeah was the to sleep on
the couch was odd if she'll probably
super tired the family's all here oh
she's gonna bite something and the
livestreams gonna crash so yeah she's
stopped clawing everything but no she's
she found her teeth she's still crossed
off I'm a sheik lost my arm like it's a
tree so I mean there's that she said yes
she gets a little lonely when she
realizes both of us are in the same room
she'll just fall asleep she's gonna eat
that paper okay okay well anyway yeah
someone let's see scrolling down here
this thing it says let me give some
advice arguing with a woman is like
reading a software place in the end you
just have to ignore everything and click
agree yeah oh you're so right
oh gee only would do that I could tell
by seeing his experience yeah no that's
why is it's very wise advice I
appreciate it anything it let's see Meck
Meck drew 41 hey guys watching from
smoky california they've had the
wildfires remember we watched why watch
the news pretty much every day and yeah
the wildfires are like 70 something
people already died from oh yeah hires
and there's like there's more than one
yeah so it's crazy what's going on this
year I don't know everywhere is
happening so much stuff yeah like our
cities still wrecked you know like in
and it's from the hurricane and and yeah
it takes like the thing is like the news
will cover it I don't know what the heck
are you doing like the news will cover
it
you know while it's happening or like
right after it happens and then that's
it then then they leave and if people
don't realize that these
sometimes entire counties or sections of
states are completely devastated for
months or years after that and it takes
a long time to I mean think about how
long it takes to build a city from the
ground up and some places especially
ones that are scorched just by fire
completely flooded over you know they
have to literally start from the ground
up again and a lot of people just leave
so then you have the issue of whether or
not you have enough people in the work
force to rebuild especially like the now
the small business sector of the city so
that's something that we'll have to see
play out here we are Lee Sears for for a
year so we'll be here at least until
next October ish and like we're on the
good side of town in the sense that we
weren't hit too hard but over on the
other side of town right where my
parents live like that their house was
gone and about 50% of houses over there
pretty much destroyed you have to be
gutted you know and same thing for
businesses so it's a really it's it's
just a really kind of mind blowing thing
yeah let me tell you it's so much
different I saw it first on a news I
wasn't here when it actually happened
and then I came here it's so much worse
really to experience and to see
everything and you see also you talk to
the people and you see how depressed
they get it's really worse than it it
could ever show us any news ya know when
you see like trees like bent over like
trees just like you can hit a tree with
a semi-truck and that tree I ain't going
anywhere
but like you hit it with a hundred and
sixty plus mile an hour winds for over
an hour and it's just you know those
things are like there's almost every
trivia so they should satellite images
of like the track of the of the
hurricane inland and like it's like that
part of the state is like completely
discolored because all the trees are
just knocked out and and so when you can
see it from space like obviously and you
can tell like it's really weird when you
cross the bridge which separates both
sides of this city Panama City Beach
from from Panama City it's just like a
night and day difference and that's how
tight the wind tunnel was right throw
that hurricane like the winds that got
up to 150 or 160 miles an hour we're all
packed within like a 5 or 10 mile radius
of the Isle wall and they're the ones
who really really
it so but yeah so to the reference about
the campfire and and the other fires
right now in California hope you stay
safe my dude and and I am it sucks I
mean I I've seen through my parents eyes
how bad it can be to lose a house I'm
just as something you can't control so
that I mean in a fire is arguably worse
because I mean the fire literally
destroys everything right yeah you can't
like you know you have time maybe to get
stuff out I mean it depends if the wind
shift and everything I've never really
been in a fire zone but I mean
everything that's left in the house if
it gets touched by the fire for sure is
gone so hopefully insurance is gonna do
its job and make up for them in more
insurance can make up for it but like if
you think about the small things like
keeping pictures and stuff that's gone
and like for so many families there's so
many memories just burned yeah
yeah so anyway shifting to a slightly
lighter tone again hope you guys stay
safe those of you who live in those
areas and see coalition gaming tada soup
chat says y'all are awesome she's always
she'll always smash you at csgo that
might be why shouldn't have to go there
why'd you have to make it personal like
that like she yeah you know this is the
one place in life where I open the
accept defeat right and and in cooking
and cleaning okay all right well maybe
now I'm PC building Louis XIV well we're
gonna push the women here but a
coalition that really hurt man that cut
deep but but you get with two dollars so
I've kind of kind of torn oh gosh
all right we have Isaac legacy to dollar
Canadian drop are seven 1700 fix pins
now glitch can't overclock three point
eight oh that's weird
maybe some improper contact I began I
have a double check all the pins just to
make sure it also seems very strange
that you dropping them you might have
dislodged some part of the chip or
warped a part of the die that it
referred to limit you to three point
eight maybe there's some power
limitation there I'm not sure but that's
really strange I mean it's better than
not having a trip at all right but I've
never experienced that firsthand so I'm
not too sure why on earth
it's locking you 23.8 that's really sir
can you run its a 1700 so I guess you
can't really run action PE but try that
game-mode try seeing if the ship itself
will you know like am AMD has that cool
and quiet mode like try disabling that
and just getting the BIOS itself to ramp
up frequency that would be the path I
would take okay let's see here john-paul
bacon if you were to suggest an MSRP for
the RX 590 cards what would it be okay
interesting because I had no idea that
the RX 5 net name was even launching
that was one of the one of the random
events that ambi never said anything to
us about and they they did such a great
job at like keeping it on the DL that
like you know I didn't even know about
it
and I talked to you know I pretty much
come into contact with most of the tech
tubers out there and if I need to send a
message to somebody typically I can if
they're following me back and I never
knew anything about it so that's how
like under wraps this was which is kind
of strange because it means RX 590 so
it's not like it's it's not something
that is like this hugely new
architecture that's gonna you know make
leaps and bounds for the graphics card
industry at AMD for the raid on division
but I will also say this because I
didn't get to test the card I never
actually was interested in seeing how
the card performed so what I'll have to
do is first off watch some of the videos
and if I decide that that card is
actually worth buying then I'll have to
go out and buy my own card people would
be surprised how much we actually still
have to buy around here despite having
access to all these companies I mean I
get it like it's a business thing you
can't hold it against the companies
we're not sending review products to
everybody out there so sometimes you got
to just bite the bullet and buy your own
products to review and that's one of the
things I've talked about in one of my
earlier how to start a YouTube channel
reviews videos about you know tech
YouTube channels and stuff so yeah let's
see des Jones what a fellow Floridian
what's up got your Black Friday list
ready you have Black Friday list no I
don't have
well I heard there is also some other
stuff shopping everything is on sale not
only tech stuff okay okay it's gonna be
my first like Friday I'm gonna go for
shopping with your family but I have no
little hmm I don't know if I should be
happy with that or worried I'm gonna
bring you something okay I just have to
also like put together a budget like a
like a budget limit I do yeah
like a cap you're right yeah I'm not
gonna spend money hmm
she well I'm sure she'll never want
something but usually you spend it on
your like she's not bad like you know
some people will just like get a credit
card and go crazy but she's like she's
really smart and something reasons why I
love her cuz like she knows she knows
how to work with money and sheshe knows
like she's sensitive to our budget and I
try my best to show her like here bed
this is how much money we're making this
mom these are the ads we have coming in
all this stuff like I'm trying I'm
trying to be as transparent as possible
with her about that because I want her
to understand when times get kind of
tough like in February March tends to be
when we don't make as much money at
least from from Google Adsense and that
makes sense right it's kind of a
downward curve from after Christmas and
New Year's so those are usually like the
months were the budgets a little tighter
but you know like the fact that she
knows all that stuff like she knows how
much we're making a month and and what
we can spend our expenses and everything
I think that helps you kind of be your
own judge with respect to what what we
can kind of splurge on and I'm really
frugal though like I we don't go out to
eat very much
I was something I was gonna say earlier
and we go away every knowing and
unsavoury know what we know and then you
take me on the date so it's nice yeah no
I know but I mean like we just don't
like some people will go out to eat like
every other day no I wouldn't do that I
like to cook so I wouldn't want that
yeah oh yeah and she cooks really and
like you know we spent she's over 100
bucks on groceries like today and like
for two people we go through food pretty
quick we did we bought a lot it'll last
like a week anyway yeah let's see
scrolling down you know I like talking
about this stuff because I don't think a
lot of people are transparent about
income and all that like I'm not going
to come out and say exactly what we make
but like it's you know everyone has a
budget and you try to live within your
means and the people that don't live
within their means like you can tell
because they're you know us about
everything or they're in trouble and
stuff starts disappearing randomly okay
scrolling down to let's see oh no Jane
was what's up bow after your lease is up
you can come buy a house in your mind so
it isn't as much of a trip to come hang
out be nice oh you know we had a house
and we were gonna look at renting that
was like a block from you know if I told
his it close whoa I told you that it was
like right down the road from no
remember yeah and and but I mean I'm
kind of in retrospect I'm glad that we
didn't rent it cuz like that house got
just like pretty much destroyed like
they said yeah but we know the people
who owned that house and they they had
yeah it's it's sucks cuz both of their
house like the house they live in and
that house both autonomous they have
nothing
yeah I'm they're just like my parents
like their house is like you know like
yeah so yeah both us he said himself and
his is a newer house I'm not mistaken I
mean it's full you can always come over
and get our Wi-Fi you don't have to ask
just come oh boy yeah we're gonna shame
but little bit he did do that one time
say hey man can I come use your Wi-Fi I
was like you know what yeah oh yeah well
I do have that son that's pretty good
I'm here for the Wi-Fi I want to bring
that to Starbucks and just be super me
yeah people will be fine let's see I am
Groot says it will be years to rebuild
that is correct let's see em copyright
you were 100 percent German no questions
about it and he's talking about you oh
no I'm you tallien actually issues oh my
both my parents are fully Italian what
just was born in Germany and I grew up
in Germany so yeah okay I'm German on
the paper like my blood is he tellin ya
I just call her German and she think you
know I'm actually Italian like my
passport says otherwise
yeah it's okay she also speaks better
German that she does Italian well but I
understand everything in the Italian and
I can speak e time yeah
not as good as German yeah well bad but
better than you Spanish okay
make it personal that's cool let's see
scrolling down yeah white carnage says
Pennsylvania only thing you need to
worry about is snow and it gets pretty
bad up in there in Pennsylvania my dad's
brother used to live in New York so I
you know there used to pretty rough
winters it's just a totally different
like we get winters down here and it
gets to like coldest ever gotten here in
Florida like North Florida was that I
can remember was like 18 degrees
Fahrenheit it's like negative negative 5
or negative 10 Celsius it's a lot yeah
it's really cool yeah it would totally
snow if there was like moisture in there
yeah yeah but I mean it's it's usually
only at night you wake up and your
windshields like completely frosted over
and stuff and you deal with all that but
up up north it's late
those are real winters you know that's
arctic air coming from Canada most of
the time so totally get it John Watson
asked how the MacBook ex-pro is treating
you would you recommend it totally would
John we're actually using it right now
again it's a great like lightweight game
or two so if you want to play I would
argue like even like or the Warcraft you
could probably play on you can I played
it on my old yeah yeah you can place it
like wow you could play dota2 like I've
been playing some runescape like the
runescape three I used to only play old
school back in the day but like I just
got into rs3 a hit double xp weekend and
stuff and I've been playing on that
double xp and oh yeah you wouldn't take
me out about the lake holy ball enough I
told her straight up I was like babe
look again this is double xp weekend
this is the this is the this weekend
counts so I've skilled so hard and I'm
about to skill again with last year's I
wouldn't need to come say hey can we get
the Pens
only I'm gonna go hard to paint like
hardcore I think it takes Allah Sam say
I'm gonna be saying up really late
tonight Bob Flanders give us seven
dollars and seventy seven cents that's a
good number Bob appreciate that and he
sent a little smiley emoji Bob's good
people Baba
yeah Bob's been in a lot of the live
streams and he's always talking to us
he's really cool
let's see script go fasta syphilis yeah
I was questioning why you did 777 but I
think that would've been a little worse
Co father
now let's see Koufos is 2016 high-end
phone or 2018 mid-range phone for
performance and camera gosh I would only
recommend you stuff to be honest I mean
like the I like the Motorola phones like
the G would have be on the g5 from
Motorola now I thinks what do you think
is what it is I use the original
Motorola or Moto G and I like that phone
back in like 2013 when I came out yeah I
mean like do you want like a mid like a
mid sized phone you want like a large
phone it kinda depends like phones
aren't like particularly my area of
expertise but I have had a lot of phones
in the past I used to buy and sell them
like all the time in high school that
was kind of how I cycled through phones
because I like changing out and testing
new ones but yeah the newer stuff like
I've been rocking the pixel three I know
that's probably out of your price range
it's pretty expensive phones are getting
really expensive now but just kind of
like a lightweight kind of mid-range
phone for 2018 I would say like
especially for Black Friday check the
deals on Amazon for sure I'm assuming I
live in the States I'm pretty sure you
do Co fuss I'm not actually don't know
no some of you I know that live in the
States especially you guys on discord
anyway speaking of discord the discord
is linked in the chat or in the
description below and that is a public
discord you don't have to pay us
anything or whatever subscribed or
whatever to join it it's totally public
and that's shared between myself and
Brian over at tech ES City and we're
both kind of popping in there from time
to time we tog will play games with some
people in there and stuff so it's a
really cool little way to to communicate
with us outside of the YouTube sphere or
outside of just social media in general
tech crimson you know take Lisa is
looking good as always hashtag my mom
does that mean I'm the dad I think I'm
dad right oh yeah you are
you forgot about that you wanted a job
that we adopt it okay to say that yeah
yeah yeah be aware half is it isn't he
like some pup - yeah 20 there yeah will
be awkward yeah I mean you know dot
people who are like you just wanted to
be a dog or like yeah I think past the
age of 18 like you can't even well I
don't know maybe nobody adopted Oh
looking that up one's the legal term is
like not adopted
no we're yeah if you are like you can be
a lot doors its new yeah it's not
necessary anymore yeah but you can be
like in someone's will or whatever like
you can be in someone's will for
inheritance and stuff it would never be
treated by this actual real son yeah
yeah I don't know I think it matters
more when you're like younger so you
need to get a time machine basically
take for instance I am Groot asked have
you received or are you receiving a
courser h1 15 platinum for review
I actually have an h1 50 that I've been
using in a couple builds I'm gonna do a
like a full-on review of that and I
wanted to compare it to the H 100 I
which is like a pretty much a staple AIO
at this point from course there so I've
been waiting on the H 100 I so I can
actually do this and apparently I guess
they thought they sent it already or
something but I haven't gotten it yet
so when I get that then I'm gonna do a
proper review between those two and then
maybe I'll do the H 115 after that
because I know that one's supposed to be
like a pretty killer cooler too so we'll
see 8 open give us tree fiddy 50 do you
know what no it's no tree the tree fiddy
that's my tree fitty
marker asks or says Lisa you should make
tutorial videos for csgo mm I need to be
honest I haven't played for such a long
time no probably two months but I start
streaming soon and I will get back to
csgo it's gonna be funny I was gonna say
gonna be super funny okay so we have a
lot we have a lot of a lot of comments
here this is good stuff we appreciate it
I'm just trying to scroll through this
okay let's see okay Matthew Andrew says
I'm drinking a beer in the shower while
watching this too much information or
not mouth oh oh
is the German beer in German beer
Germans are so picky about their beers
yeah we're picking blame like our gears
are like basically water here it's kind
of a nasty 84 action Jack ever had a bad
experience with a deep cool captain I
have not today and again I can't really
like and I kind of stressed this in the
video that I made about the captain 240
X and then all derivatives of that look
I really
like the Dean Coolio's I think they're
my favorite a I was from an aesthetic
point of view performance wise they're
they're okay they're not the best a iOS
out there but they I think I think
they're just a good value considering
how much you typically have to spend for
it for some a iOS speaking of which we
have can have it we have this block this
is the 240 pro so maybe we'll do a an H
159 verse to 40 page 115 I have 240
million oh pretty sure it is if it's not
then I'll find one I got a derivative of
that it's similar to this and we'll
review this against that and see which
one is this is the one you guys saw it
copy text 20 18 by the way you were
there yeah I filmed in yep so that one
is coming up soon
speaking of the captain but yeah like
I've never had a bad experience please I
know that people have complained about
these leaking in the past and really I
mean a iOS one extender I mean you're
gonna have a small typically sample of
of the units that are gonna leak that's
just something that you know robots
humans they're gonna make mistakes but I
have never had one of these a iOS leak
before now to what extent that has to do
with the fact that I'm a reviewer maybe
they open the boxes and test them before
they send them to me I've had some like
sealed
you know like properly sealed boxes only
retail samples sent they'll just like
send them direct from Amazon and so I
know those aren't really tested names on
it's not gonna test those for me and
those haven't leaked either and I've had
like eight or nine of these a iOS
probably more than that probably closer
to a dozen so just just from my
perspective I don't see anything wrong
with them and apparently the new 240
pros are like supposed to be virtually
leak proof thanks to that basically
that's like a pressure valve built into
the radiator it's right there so we'll
talk more about that in the video and if
that actually does anything or just a
marketing hype kind of looking at the
mechanics of it and see what it's all
about but anyway that's that's kind of
just in a nutshell what's coming up here
soon
but Zynga 500 super chat again bazinga
my date Lisa cooks I'm half German I
love German food only three hours away
one is then
all right you can come fine you know
though you don't really fix German food
and I think I can't fix Germany I
probably might like your pinky yeah I
don't really like German from very much
like I feel like the de facto food you
haven't tried you have tried
stuff like I like the shot my mom was
yeah yeah it's like German dishes and
you really like I like the breakfast and
stuff like oh this and like um the
Swami's and meats you guys have like
especially the ones that are like
imported those are so good
no this salami is this the Italian
salami Paris and I'm eating it a Germany
source although the German salami yeah
you like that yeah I all that stuff like
the meats I'm totally cool with it's
just like the you know the sauerkraut
and stuff like that I just can't get
into yeah but yeah but you better dishes
like you gonna like
let's see step start starfish stat fish
what is this st 41 three fish I'll just
assume that's like a fish I feel like I
feel like we're missing something there
anyway he asked Greg any phone reviews
coming I will be reviewing the pixel 3
very soon I'll also be reviewing the
iPhone 10 arm which I think is getting a
bad rap for a wrong for the wrong reason
no well she convinced me to buy it first
off I think it's an overpriced phone I
think all phones over $700 $600 arguably
like phones used to be only about 600
bucks like that was a high-end phone
assuming you're buying off contract or
whatever but no like you're spending as
much of on a phone if you are on a
laptop and phones are getting very
powerful but how I mean it's a phone
like how much more can you possibly do
with a phone you know without a proper
keyboard and without like the ability to
do heavy multitasking well but the phone
is the most used nice but like most
people just think most people just call
text check email like and watch a
YouTube video you don't need like a
killer high end processor for any of
that stuff you just need a decent amount
of RAM a decent screen and a good camera
and the budget better ELA oh yeah yeah
better yeah i way better like heavily
actually there's it and your phone has
insane battery life yeah yes and partly
because of the screen i only have to
charge it every three days right now
what the heck and you're pretty heavy
user i would say that's pretty
impressive well i'm
son she is it a line you call on her a
lot even if I do like video chat calls
where'd you used to use a lot battery
but it's still really fine yeah so that
I mean that's that's sure and I think
again like the screen resolution was
something that the iPhone 10 are
initially got some pay for and I mean my
responses like come on give me a break
first off like a 4k screen like that
last didn't like that's you probably for
cash means in like what two or three
phones now I know the Sony but I forget
the name of the film that Sony's II
something or whatever that phone had a
4k screen and the battery life was
terrible not and you also lose
brightness to okay you also lose the
degree of brightness because those
pixels are getting so small so lights
passing through a very smaller section
of the liquid crystal display or
whatever technology it is so it's it's
kind of a a give and take but 720p even
on a 6.1 inch screen like yours isn't
pretty sure it's it's not bad at all and
this is a 1080p screen and iconic it
super close to this thing to be able to
tell the difference between this and her
phone and her phone's bigger - right so
the pixels are the aspect there is
larger so I think the 10r got a lot of
hate just because the resolution is
lower but again it's not something that
I would be willing to hate on if I got
way better battery life out of it and
again unless you get super close to the
phone like if you actually squint at it
it's you're not gonna really notice I'm
sure people oh what I notice the
difference between 720p and 1080p well
sure maybe like on a monitor size but
like when you're talking about the
difference between 350 PPI and 400 PPI I
don't know people say they see the
difference and I get it like when you
see a high def screen obviously you go
back down from that and it's it's
difficult but I just think it got way
too much hate given the small difference
if there is any noticeably on screen
that's my take on it and you'll hear
more about that in the video I'm sure
that I'll get me some hate but whatever
I'm Pepsi is back up here a Pepsi go hey
how you doing she's like navigating like
the most treacherous terrain right now
you're standing on the sound board
I don't like that I'm like she just that
she's always pushing the limit here I'm
gonna scroll back up the chat just a
little bit I kind of missed it
Oh Ethan asked if I have tried so no
yeah it's like the fried pork chop oh
yeah yeah yeah my mom used to fix like
this big schnitzel oh yeah
EJ ninja Tech is good question do you
use an amp dak system when gaming for
better sound if so do you use do you use
and your go-to headphones I'm confused
or is it even worth the investment
um I look I use whenever I'm personally
gaming typically it's between the
coarser H s HS 60 somebody I forget the
names of all these products anyway I use
the coarse their heads up I reviewed
against the void Pro and then I also use
the sennheiser headset that i am did a
pre-roll for I did a couple pre-rolls
I'm pretty sure for it more than a
couple and I really liked she's gonna
what what is she doing anyway um I I
really like the headset that's why I was
come putting out so many ads for it
because I do think it's a really good
headset not just from the audio side of
things and I just really good bran but
also from the audio quality like the the
microphone quality is really good it's
it's a lot better most gaming headsets
of trash mics now but this one was
actually impressive and a lot gamers and
a professionai seeing pro like the
sennheiser brand they always did a great
job
Pepsi girl all Pepsi girl she was like
banning on the sound board and I'm
afraid she's gonna click the power
button or the phantom power button
anyway okay i'm gonna scroll down just a
little bit more here let's see trying to
catch up some good stuff this is all
really good stuff is Tama content here
the best German chocolate is the best
swiss chocolate is like this no i swiss
and belgium chuck is really petty
certain German Swiss Swiss writes
British white chocolate chocolate
chocolate chocolate yeah a lot like oh
my god
yeah I'm not so we space for improvement
you know I think my accent is beautiful
I have a beautiful German accent
yeah if you talk German and it sucks
cute she says I sound like a little kid
yeah that's fine dude that's fine yeah
um scrolling down oh gosh there's so
much so so many things I miss any of
them here okay all right all right here
we go let's see Vadim karaeski that 10
is a euro yeah it's 10 you and you're a
mutt dude idean 10 here
appreciate that hi I want to upgrade my
lg ultra wide 29 inch 10 D come on I'm
pretty sure I've had that same monitor
by the way or one very similar to it for
an alienware 34 inch 1080p curved with
juicing one 100 Hertz do you think I
will see a big difference in pixel
density in gaming yeah okay so like 34
inches that's a pretty big difference
between that and 29 I would recommend if
you step up to 34 inches that you get
the 1440p aspect the or the the 34 40 by
1440 is the 21 by 9 equivalent
resolution in 1440p if you step up to 34
that's my rule of thumb I've had 1080p
32 inch panels
it gets pretty noticeable especially at
that diagonal resolution and when you're
going ultra wide at 34 inches it's
basically a stretch 32 inch panel or
slightly narrower from vertical aspect
but you get the point so yeah I mean
depending on your budget again if you
really like ultra wide and you you're
you're okay with a hundred Hertz I would
go for the I mean it's it's okay but if
I could if I had a little more wiggle
room I would try to bump up to the 1440p
resolution and still walk in that 10
that hundred Hertz refresh rate I use
the hundred Hertz actually this monitor
right here behind me is it's a from via
text like five hundred bucks or so but
it's a thirty four forty by 1440 panel
and it's also a hundred Hertz it's not
g-sync though that's the one thing I
think I'm pretty sure it's free sync so
if you have an AMD card you'll benefit
from that but it doesn't have G sync so
that's the one thing that I wish it had
it's a mediocre construction it's not a
really you know strong durable monitor
from that perspective but like how often
do you be like throwing your monitor
around
so I just can't since they're gaming
could be and that's true if you get
pissed off yeah I'm your monitor against
I think there are a lot of idiots out
there we go smash that's 303 good point
okay a lot of good stuff here let's see
oh gosh
let's see Leslie Lai thinks you have a
fake German accent fake German tank said
unless she literally lives in tree like
she's live in Germany or Hawaii yeah
for an in German usually funny but you
said I don't sound that German when I
speak English so no I mean you sound
your opinion like I don't I don't know
what a German accent is like I mean I
would have known if I hadn't met you
ah let's see Bob Frank question for k60
or 1440p 124 an RT X 27 T our tix 27 t I
would always go for the higher refresh
rate 1440p 120 is definitely the better
buy in my book look for K would look
pretty sweet and it does for sure
definitely a higher ppi but you've got
to really work that graphics card and in
order to benefit from 4k you have to
really bump up the in-game settings to
even notice much of a difference from
like a visual perspective because 4k is
gonna tax your graphics card harder
which means you might have to drop some
ingame settings and when you drop in
game settings you're just looking at a
higher resolution worse image if you get
what I'm trying to say like you you know
you might have to lower grass quality
from ultra to high and then you're
missing out on like half the the shrubs
in like you know nature that you would
otherwise be able to see crystal-clear
with a 4k panel so by the 1440p panel in
my book that's the better choice you get
the higher refresh rate which is a night
and day difference and you can bump up
like MSAA you can turn on ambient
occlusion some other things are gonna
make the game look a little more
realistic and I think you're not gonna
regret the decision so hopefully Bob
hopefully about you take that advice
that that's definitely what I was doing
and you yeah you're always playing like
fast games like if you play fast
especially in 1820
yeah that's a good point like if you're
just playing like City skylines or
something like a 4k panel is probably
okay for that but like if you're playing
a racing game first-person shooter any
kind of first-person shooter
third person for that matter like it's
all gonna be yeah no one asks are you
going to vlog your wedding oh well we've
we're already married but we do plan on
like having like a wedding like I don't
you want to call on that but like we
want to have a ceremony yeah yeah why
you see it's a wedding so yeah but
because most people like I didn't and I
didn't really think about this either
but like most people are already
officially married by the time they have
their wedding right because they go to
the state and I already file that
paperwork like the wedding is still kind
of like an after it's like an after
event you know like you know wanna be
the exciting thing when you have your
friends and family yeah that's really
bad yeah yeah we did we kind of we kind
of did it we we had planted to wait a
lot longer because I had only proposed
to her what three months prior almost
two or three months so I had a we were
talking about it and she was about to
leave and I was just like you know I
screw it okay now I don't take any
chances if she gets back you know I like
Jeremy a lot more than stay here so are
you gonna move for me but I totally
would I would totally move if I had I
mean like the cool thing about this job
is I'm going there yes I know but the
fact is we don't have to move and we
know it's fine believe me if I'd yeah I
if I had no ties to this city and I had
known that this place was gonna get
whacked by hurricane I totally probably
would've made it like you know I just
would have cause like there's like I get
like I said two-thirds of the city's
practically gone so that's something
that I'm gonna at the same time like I'm
glad we stayed because now I can help my
parents and stuff and of course we've
been going like it you know once twice a
week over to their place and like just
guarding the house yeah but I see how it
cuts off like that I don't know why oh
no see it doesn't cut off here but it
cuts off there yeah because here you
have to is it zoomed in yeah it's
probably zoom yes yeah I hate that I so
I can never tell if it's actually but it
looks good there so that's all that's
anyway okay uh it's got a scroll down a
little bit here let's go down over Oh
Leslie was referring to me uh I'm glad I
wasn't like bro
what you say about my wife bro huh huh
you want to talk some smack bro
I could have totally like defended you
there I just that's cool that's cool I
know what caused a scene or anything
kWe talks if I don't blame you Greg
no like-minded individual not chat there
you go
you don't even know us for 45 minutes oh
we do already I told you wow I mean
they're easy in the sense of like oh I
gotta do is talk you know and have some
water in case your throat good yeah okay
so the good thing is that a coast now so
you can talk on taking an awkward sip of
water so good I know it's gonna be
awkward
Oh see can you read this sentence in
here he's asking you something in German
yeah do you know that I guess yeah yeah
begets uh I feel like you have a Spanish
accent when you speak German a little
bit it's the N word Spanish I don't know
where it's coming from
oh yeah they're especially you know what
sometimes special okay I don't take
anything personally she gives me crap
because like I'm supposed to be Spanish
but like I don't act Spanish but I
totally am Spanish he always calls me a
white girl because of my iPhone probably
yeah yeah you know when they always
pretending to be super special like
doesn't like to go out in the Sun
stereotypical like way cool thing she's
got going she's got her eye she's got
her MacBook Pro she's got her iPad pros
she's got her iPhone 10 my MacBook since
7 years already I always kept them
people you have the new MacBook no no no
you I'm afraid of mine I upgraded that I
have rated your phone I gave no I bought
in she I'm gonna yeah this is before
this is before our finance is officially
combing well we weren't married yet
worry no wait no you just gotten engaged
yeah yeah so I was like all right like
she turned credit like she totally
consulted me she's like I want to buy
this iPad I'm like bro well I didn't say
proud but like yeah I was like I know I
was like why do you want to spend this
much money on my bed bro yeah you simple
work I'll totally use it for work I'm
like okay but like why did you not like
why did why don't you just
your laptop well but in some situations
you take the tablet it's easier and the
end the top Ana Apple Pro is so nice
because you do you can do a lot of
graphic stuff like instant and always to
take out the laptop I think it's
sometimes uncomfortable yeah yeah
situation I feel like I feel like like I
feel like tablets are like a kind of
like anise like they're in a weird I
mean if you don't use it or tablet you
wanted to have it then it's no doubt
that I use it but or tablets really
portable though that can you call a
tablet app or yes it fits in back and so
does a laptop so there's a laptop I mean
so it's efficient yeah backpack but uh
but uh tablet you can the small town yes
not a big 12 inch iPad twelve point nine
nine one there's a tenant right yeah
yeah anymore yours is about as big as I
would ever want to tablet to be if it's
in my bag uh you guys have iPads or like
any kind of tablet what size tablet ease
and do you think it's obsolete
it wasn't seen in the context of laptops
I just find myself missing a keyboard
and like the operating systems like
Jesus I don't want I oh s ten or
whatever on an iPad like I want I would
much prefer Mac OS totally would prefer
that and the and the new iPads I think
could support Mac OS like they're
powerful enough they have insanely fast
processors but like we have iOS on those
things I know there's maybe there's
something like didn't like public debate
out there about whether or not that's
even possible but I would just I would
much prefer like that kind of I don't
know setup like this laptop I can't
convert into like a tablet mood but it
would be nice to be able to do that cuz
then I could fold it all the way around
only thing is you have the keyboard
awkward and then the son that you're
pushing you can buy an extra key before
determine you have it then it's just
like an afterthought I don't know I have
someone I mean it's their friend it
depends always on the use yeah for on
your needs I think if you want a game on
thing on the thing I think a laptop is
necessary well yeah I mean there Jeremy
yeah but but Gabe you can also do a
runescape on the tablet yeah you maybe
you can't play wild Oh on a tablet
unless you like did some weird thing I'm
like Linux on it or something not an I'm
not iPad but like I'm sure you probably
do something like that
you can also use it as a second screen
extension yeah if you seen what I did
when you work with Photoshop or
something that's nice yeah let's see
Aidan he'll ask how bad my German we
talked about a little earlier in the
livestream Billy if you could quantify
and like a couple sentences my German
Lee how bad is it
um well she he speaks
um maybe two sentence all the time the
same and he tells me all the time you
want to learn in the enemy to say like
two sentences yeah cred I totally can
sleep like four senses okay do it
everybody's willing to you I'm like like
when you told me to do it like I my
first thought was like hola I totally
yeah I mix of Spanish and German all the
time so it was like the only two lines
for you to explain everything in German
right now yeah I know that sentence
that's I learn know I'm very here there
and then also how old guten tag it's
basically all these they sent to mom and
then I also say that's Essen it's good
oh yeah that's what he had to learn
because if you go and eat food from an
Italian woman you always have to tell
her it's good food no matter what tell
her even if you don't like it tell her
uh uh Bob's good in bed Bob said you
guys do a great show really enjoyed it
click here if you enjoyed making this
video click here if you don't or hate
everything else about life oh you said
life I get it though anything about life
do you like life screaming I like live
streaming so I like to do it myself I'm
finally happy to get back to it soon and
it's nice it's nice always to talk to so
many people at the same time
yeah I'm help tomorrow with your tech
question to snowy says I said he loves
Emma she loves them when I say if I said
yeah Emma Oh Emma I am M ER who's Emma
fewer is it fu r r fh u RF u HR yeah
yeah I don't I can't do that let's key
word Zoe you ER mmhmm yeah Emma like
that yeah yeah
got him yeah you totally needed my help
no I didn't okay oh I thought there was
an agent yeah your mo few email I'm in
there ml ml it's not there's an ro
you're rolling your arm days are no no
no but it sounds like there's an L on
the are yeah amen
it mattered to the exam 16 ml like ma
yeah that's why they think you say Emma
Emma Emma Emma if you say for Emma it's
for Emma
ah sounds like for him you know I see
like that that's the parts gonna be the
most difficult for me it's like figuring
out how to like pronounce like get to
accent I think Germans it's not I don't
think it's hard to learn the language
because a lot of their stuff is shared
between English I mean English like
adopted a lot of Germanic phrases but
uh-huh the the dialect or whatever you
want to call it you guys don't I mean
like the the way you sound when you
speak the language that is probably the
hardest part and like Germans like in my
opinion German sound like really pissed
off most of the time when they speak
like nah really aggressive I think it's
an aggressive language we think that
about the Russians they sound ok yeah I
mean I think it's play step further but
like you're still in the general
direction of like aggressive sounds yeah
but the thing is when you express
everything with like showing these kind
of emotions when we talk maybe that's
makes it harder I don't know yeah that's
true
watching ourselves and playback is
really awkward like I feel like my like
my actions you know yeah and then you
think oh they are like wow do that
really do
like wow they look really cringey yeah
yeah don't scratch your nose it would
look awkward
I am going to put him in time Oh zombies
civvies did thank zombies that was
really awkward it was a request for us
to do something oh I didn't see that
use your imagination Oh Laker girl
chrome says can you even German bro
thanks man yeah German bro it feels so
good let's see what is that is that okay
read yeah okay it's not that yes you
leave a - coin this coin der Hector I
think you was supposed to say you can
even mine fine take Dora
yeah he messed it up veidt's velocity
cody slug spam the discord good on you
Cody you guys check out the discord
server it is a public discord does not
require anything to join although you do
get special perks if you become a
channel member or a patreon supporter
but by no means an obligation and you
guys get a different way to chat with us
and also with Brian from tech yes City
we share that discourse server with him
I think that was a really good decision
because it just allows us to kind of
meld between different fan bases like
most of you who sub here are probably
subbed to other tech channels as well I
get that but chances are if you are set
for this channel you appreciate our
point of view or maybe the way we do
things or test things but then you're
also stuck to the other channels because
they have different points of view and
if all of us were in agreement all the
time there would be a problem a big
problem so it's good that like when I
popped into this Court I see people know
what's they arguing but they're debating
you know they're they're giving
different recommendations for parts and
stuff and saying well my experience with
this product is this and it's really
nice to see that because I mean it's
saving that stuff for just the YouTube
comments can be pretty hostile because
people feel like the YouTube comments
vice city says Wow two years of German
for nothing
psy asks why there's such a big delay in
chat that's typical it's just YouTube's
delay so what we're watching right now
on the screen is what you guys are
seeing right but the difference is
there's a
fifteen to twenty second buffer usually
between when it's encoded and sent to
YouTube servers and when it's actually
published live so what we're doing is
reading the chat basically live but
there's gonna be a 20 or 30 seconds so
it's 20 to 30 second delay there just
because yeah yeah and there's like a
there's a minimum latency option and
there's like a no latency option in
YouTube live streams so it would be
almost instantaneous but the problem is
when you do that you you should kind of
cut into your own video quality to an
extent like it just looks a little like
the bitrate I'm pretty sure drops yeah
in coding process because god do really
quick so it can't like encode it and
like take its time and make it look
really crispy for you guys so that's the
one downside that's why I've never
really used that I did use the minimum
latency option once and it didn't look
too much different but I think probably
next time I'll do they're like no
latency option and just see if it's even
possible and then we won't have to deal
with people asking why the chats so
destroyed you know I'm like delayed but
yeah it's it's pretty new people are
stands like a 30 36 36 seconds later
it's gonna depend on the person to where
you're viewing it friend that's also an
aspect of it because you have latency on
your side as well so that's another part
of it but for us cuz we're literally
watching as it's being streamed it's
about 20 to 30 seconds it depends ok
Jeff Phillips says hello from the future
totally misunderstand that zombie says
you get creepy you get the creepy
comments yeah yeah zombies I appreciate
you guys running the chat as admins you
guys are awesome you and Colossus both
have been doing some work so I
appreciate it said that you guys have to
be used for that kind of stuff but y'all
are doing a sweet job so we appreciate
it
let's see Leslie Leslie lie do you are
TX it depends from 120fps to 30fps r-tx
on yeah that's a good point our tix was
pretty disastrous from what I saw with
the battlefield 5 benchmarks on versus
off and like that honestly the in-game
detail didn't change much and that was
something I was worried about from the
very beginning with this that's why I
came forward initially right when they
launched the food cards or announced the
cards I basically went out and said yeah
like a lot of this is probably gonna be
marketing hype and you're gonna be a
little disappointed with how these guys
performing real life
especially given the minimum support we
have right across all these different
titles we only have what may be a
handful of games they're eventually
going to support r-tx and when I say
r-tx I'm talking about the the ways in
which reflections and all that are
portrayed in game it totally changes the
physics of the game and does rely
heavily on the architecture that
invitees packed into it but there is
still a lot of interpolation involved so
it's not totally real-time ray tracing
but it does require an RT course
intensive course the AI side of things
to predict the extra particles that are
supposed to move around in the scene
that's the interpolation aspect of it so
I might make a second video following up
on the architecture now that I
understand a little more about it
because it's a little more been reviewed
I've been able to talk to some other
people in the industry who have a pretty
tight grasp on this stuff and it's
opened my eyes to how it actually works
behind the scenes so yeah
maybe more archaic stuff here in the
near future just to explain really what
you should expect with these cards and
what to expect maybe in two or three
years
jorge morales what does your fiance do
she's actually my wife no yeah we've
been married for like eight months yeah
yeah I didn't want to get that wrong
yeah we've been married for quite a
while I don't blame you the thing and I
like if you if you only occasionally
have pop into social media whatever but
you well I work as a sport manager kinda
I do like social media work and stuff
from Home Office and do this and the
eSport gym but it's like really on and
off like right now she's not working but
like when she's still work yeah but
sometimes like not right only when I'm
in Germany right now yeah right now
because I'm visiting him is not like
yeah right now I'm not working but once
I go back then I'm full-time again yeah
she is a cool boss you know it's it's
something that he knows her situation
and so yeah he gives her a lot of leeway
and it's really flexible so that's
that's a good thing yeah only if I have
to attend on eSport he wins I'm gonna
fly back attend to him sport events and
go back yeah we we actually have that
was how we met
we met she worked she worked for a
company actually at the time that had
sent us over there and so we met her
they they kind of took us out on the
town and showed us everything I was very
first murder but that was another thing
that she had done on the side she was
really heavy into like the PC tech and
the PC gaming markets and you still kind
of bored to an extent when you're
actually working so yeah that is that's
what she does I kind of spoke for you on
that one but anyway that's okay sorry
you can't explain better I'm used to
just like talking
I really know when I am live-streaming
wanderer it's not only when he live
streams or when he makes this video you
know he talks a lot right you can't tell
by his videos well you have to do that
in the videos but he's also doing that
every life you sometimes I can sit there
like just like that
ten minutes and he would constantly talk
stopped at times all the talking and
like the guy's pretty yeah go over like
I can relax I can be back relax take a
nap and then wake up and say uh ya know
when I do that to you you get mad you're
like you didn't listen to me one I'll
never get mad oh my livestream they know
I know very romantic
uh yeah in conferences Gregg a little
advice always remember everything about
your wife or she will kill you pay
attention to everything she says and
does or you'll pay heavily came a the
wiki is good question Greg what's your
favorite thing to do other than computer
stuff I think a tarp I'm on my next
favorite thing like music in general I
really like music not runescape
runescape like you talk okay like a
runescape nerd now I'd you know just
pick that up again cuz I wanted to see
how much it change in RS 3 and it's so
far it's really changed it's really easy
to skill now um anyway what about you
answer that question too about what you
wait your favorite thing to do is other
than computer stuff that's totally a
favorite thing to do
oh I love dancing I love dancing I play
just dance okay I love dancing and going
to
Beach yeah like like being outside and
taking a walk I think pretty much
everywhere I could just walk randomly on
the street and I like that yeah that's
fair
yeah she's always wanting to go I wish
like I wish we had a house like right on
the beachfront like if I could afford
that gosh that would be really nice
especially for you like I probably
wouldn't it the view would probably all
I care about it I wouldn't go to the
beach beach much but if she could just
like open her backdoor and like walk on
the sand
you would totally I know you would I
would like that it would be like I mean
it wouldn't be necessary here but you
can't really walk in the States and you
have to drive it with the car and the
sidewalks are like minimal it's really
nice for me because I don't have a car
so I'm depending on him and I have with
me so bazinga thank you yeah cane elite
asks what guitarist you have alright get
my list right here we got a again ESP
totally forget that it's a 1000 i only
don't know the name of this one because
she bought it for me base B Ltd doubt
thousand that one that Breaking Benjamin
had breaking measures like my favorite
band ever
so yeah yeah and neck guitar is dope I
have two gifts and Les Paul customs ones
red ones black I have a Gibson SG
I have bender strat and like an American
strat because it's American and then
that's really it and we have a couple
like baby Taylor's like acoustic guitars
and stuff but electrics that's that's
what and then go one from Redflex you
picked up when you were 13 oh yeah yeah
my yeah so I was with my parents I was
back when I was like 13 we went to Six
Flags Great Adventure in New York it's
better my dad's brother used to live up
there so we have there to see him and
stuff and then we went to the theme park
and and they have those platforms right
are you gonna knock the it's like those
those alphabet cubes where they call
like do you know those cubes like the
woods with the alphabet letters in them
I don't know
to have an actual name I think they do I
don't feel stood there cubes anyway
yeah those things they have three of
them stacked on top of each other and
then you have a platform and you get a
ball and you got to throw the ball from
about ten feet away or so a little more
than that it's about it's about five
meters but you have to throw and hit the
all three balls at once and our lightest
dad and not all of them off fire
inaudible shooting should we use this
make sure that yeah no it's it's still
gonna be you'll see it when it turns off
anyway yeah but you want a guitar for me
there it's like it's shaped like a
Fender Strat obviously it doesn't same
pickups or anything but it looks cool
yeah that's gonna be her guitar so she
can you start learning yeah he's gonna
teach me um let's see if we can make a
video on that one ah it's Schrag just
mounting your headphone on the monitor
like that like you did with damage the
pixels kind of pressure I know so the
the the headset doesn't clamp really
tight at all so I just kind of hangs
there so actually there's like a gap
between like the earpiece or the ear
muffs what are gonna call them your
sections of the headset it's not like
suffocating the pixels to knowledge is
it's not hurting at all some I imagine
some headsets though that are gripping
really tight probably would so you might
want to watch out for that let's see
scrolling down here uh-huh
players spin see when will you do
Craigslist listings reactions again very
soon don't worry those aren't going
anywhere you guys really like those and
yeah I like just yeah it's much in I
always tell him doing that agrees with
you yeah yeah let's go for that yeah I
mean those good like obviously like
those get views and people really like
engaging with those and and the YouTube
algorithms really like Craigslist uh for
some reason like the the Craigslist
keywords are like really hot so it helps
from an Adsense perspective because
videos are actually like twice as
profitable do you know that like those
videos make more like you have like CPMs
right cost per thousand views or
whatever it's basically what we get paid
per thousand views mm-hmm and the CPM on
a Craigslist video I was like I want to
say 1.5 to 2 times what it typically is
on this channel oh wow which is really
weird like I never said I never did this
to you know for the ID cents saying that
it was gonna be like way more
I mean obviously if it gets views do you
guys really like it I'm gonna keep doing
it it's made smile I mean it's super
entertaining yeah I mean it's fun to
make yeah really like you I mean people
that have no clue they can really learn
about that that they don't get ripped
off so yeah yeah that's true yeah so
there's actually like an informative
aspect of it and I think you guys
appreciate that the ones who actually
watch all the time
see guten nacht Allah good to knock a
little salmon I'm gonna go get some
homework done all right good night have
sweet dreams oh what's this what's that
mean where it's done it's done I'll see
you soon see you around oh I'm learning
stuff every day I'm gonna seriously get
serious about taking German classes yeah
we're serious yeah yeah you gotta
communicate with your mama I'm saying I
almost said all out again oh my gosh
hello guten morgen Ola your mama totally
understand that too but is just kind of
funny all right that I'm mixing them up
so much all right let's see here I see
ya what did you predict the rise in
3,700 X will achieve in terms of
overclocking um look I if it's the 30s I
don't know if it's actually gonna be
called 37 I don't really dive into the
leaks and stuff until it's all official
when we get the official paperwork from
AMD but I expect the next gen stuff's
gonna definitely look like better I
think it's is one of the reasons why a
MB is a little behind in the gaming
performance side of things because again
those 2,700 X will only clock to about
four point two gigahertz I imagine at
2,700 X at five gigahertz or 5.2 like we
have with an 8700 K you know deleted or
a 9900 K so I'm hoping around 4.6 I
would say I would say don't expect any
more than 4.6 to 4.8 but I'm really
hoping for 4.6 I think that would make a
world of difference let's see 8 Neil
says great stream guys I'm gonna grab
some sleep it's 4 a.m. here in Ireland
wow dude 4 a.m. my dude and it's like
boy still join me it's like a Monday
morning for you that's incredibly saan
go to Nam
well that's appreciated thank you said
Torres what's going on so that said was
uh he was one of the winners of uh he
won a gtx 1070 graphics oh wow yeah he's
still sporting he said it was when i
painted white it was in the original
walter white build oh yeah
so he story so sport now on it's pretty
pretty dope let's see my kinases dunno
chance you're getting four point six all
core yeah we'll see I'm talking about
the future a MDC piece by the way not
like current AMD CPUs but again like
none of this is substantiated so it's
all best guess but that's my hope
because if it gets to four point six
then you're gonna you it on top of that
on top of the ICT proven Salone from the
architectural standpoint I think will
have something that's actually worth you
know worth being in the top tier best
contender for best gaming CPU and I
think it could be especially if Intel is
a little slow which they have been
recently with their ten enemy your stuff
so I can I expect these releases will be
sometime around April may ish maybe even
Computex time for AMD people are saying
early 2019 but it's very rare that we
see anything that early especially from
AMD
so well we'll see West West at zero says
or o was oh hello Franco says hey Stein
studio I enjoy the videos of you looking
at dumb PC ads the I start the crisis
videos and the ghetto studio videos you
actually get a studio that's cool like
um will get that I'm looking at myself
like it looks like I'm picking my nose
like what am i doing
yeah see this I told you don't scratch
your nose I told no I didn't I didn't
why did that but like if I do this I get
it on camera almost looks like I can do
it anyway alright we're about to wrap
this one up here
Cedar's Germans in there it's 5:00 a.m.
food him that's super thomas wall says a
PM west coast six a.m. and romania
Florin wow that's super well maybe they
just got up you know breakfast cereals
and
oh so nice dream why not yeah that's
really early I guess you have work that
early knows I remember I only had one
job after that required make it up
thoroughly I was a referee for soccer
and always had to get up super early in
the morning because some of the little
kids games you know I used six games
like six-year-olds with play we'd have
to roughly the younger kids games first
and she doesn't think I like exert like
like it she doesn't think I work out or
anything like I doesn't think oh it
doesn't something you know well no like
we were helping my parents couple days
ago oh you're actually lifting you're
actually lifting heavy stuff well you're
getting your hands dirty
give him so much crowd oh yeah and you
still with me uh Marcus is going great
quit poking your nose the wife just told
you
am I still doing that maybe it's just
like I'm just gonna give up just yeah
I'm gonna duct-tape my hands so the desk
and just call it a day all right we're
about to call this one quits you guys
are awesome we have about I saw the Pete
made like over three hundred viewers
watching that's pretty good for us
because like we don't make these things
like super official hardcore or anything
we don't promote them a lot but we do do
them every Sunday night and I know maybe
I'll get you to be in more these in the
future I think people appreciated your
presence I'm gonna join ya let's see-oh
GGO says great job your channel is one
of the only ones where I watch all the
video here much about the topic I
appreciate that now then we're all there
refresher you know I put some of the
videos that are on the minute science
and crash course playlist or you know I
think elementary to a lot of people but
for for new newbies I guess it's it's
stuff that's completely you know unknown
to them so that stuff helps them for
sure and I get that like I'm kind of
isolating a section of my audience
because most of you are building pcs
probably know this stuff now but it
never hurts to watch the video and get a
refresher you might learn something new
and honestly when I'm writing these
scripts and I'm doing the research for
these videos i learned stephanie all the
time that's why i say thanks for
learning loads that's where that comes
from
so yeah let's see what is that greg
misty give you steam you have to lift
weights yeah I used to all the time yeah
check my Instagram way back in the day
check him way back in the day I was
always testing ripped he always told
I'm so proud of ripped yes never seen
that no when you say sure I mean I was
when I met him anyway yeah and my father
call it my first year college I was that
all I did was working I was a at the
time I wasn't an engineering major yet I
was just still in business you're not an
engineer and you're an engineer but I
mean you're not in school anymore
doesn't matter no I finished so yeah and
now I now we have bills to pay and all
these other things that are taking
priority mm-hmm
lifting the groceries that's a workout
in itself right there anyway I have
plenty of time to be frank to actually
go to work out I'm just gonna get back
in agree you guys know how it is like
you go to the gym and it feels great but
then you got to force yourself for the
next couple of days and eventually it's
like you need it like your body craves
the workout like it craves the pump and
so I'm kind of I'm trying to get back
into that zone yeah we have to do it one
week straight up or two week straight up
and then you're in and then yeah yeah so
anyway to do that yeah we're gonna
create you hit next block the change you
wanna you want us to vlog it yeah yeah
come on I workups know what you should
do you should be the first youtuber that
works off with it with his cases and
stuff obviously started like yeah yeah
for people that kind of a curler you
know and then you see you take PC stuff
like bench press like a heavy PC case
yeah oh we could do like a like a custom
loot build mm-hmm like really heavy like
80 pound build I can just like go first
you you start without liquid Ursula yeah
and then you at the liquid so it's
getting heavy and the incentive is don't
drop it or your systems toast
so uh-huh it's motivating you do you
know if you type your talents is on a
sixth time a week gym goer I need to
create it I told it like I get that like
I know what that's like it's just
getting better you know yeah muscle
memory and stuff it won't be hard it's
just like I think the hardest part is
getting back into the groove of things
so I used to do it all the time and once
when I started like coming here to the
states and going back and so and it
always took me out of the rhythm and
stuff and then yeah demotivates you go
