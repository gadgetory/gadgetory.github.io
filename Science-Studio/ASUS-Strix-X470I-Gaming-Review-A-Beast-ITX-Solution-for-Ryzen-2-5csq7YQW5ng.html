mean sure they include compromises us
any downsized would but when done right
I TX pcs can look elegant and boasts
tons of power you all know this a sous
nailed it here with their ro G Strix x47
Ti and gaming they went after the
fantastic chipset capable of handling
eight cores and 16 threads in such a
small space is incredible and stable
memory overclocking which is a big thing
with rise in 2nd gen well put all three
to the test in this video but first a
run-through of the board's IO and
features let's start first with the rear
i/o and work our way around fan hubs and
drive support near the top you'll find
an HDMI port good for Raven Ridge ap use
at this point still nice to have that
onboard flexibility for USB 3.1 gen2 on
port slate just below that followed by
two USB 3.1 gen2 ports the big
difference here these four cap at five
gigabits per second and these two
capitán and until rj45 port resides here
as well you'll find AC Wi-Fi to the
south along with built-in Bluetooth and
LED illuminated audio jacks boasting the
quote supreme FX s 1228 codec and dual
operational amplifiers on a secondary
PCB in typical Asus fashion this is
definitely overkill I'm counting only
three PWM fan headers here and they're
all situated above the CPU socket I
would have liked to have seen maybe then
spread out just a bit more along the
edge of the board also three is just not
enough for an overkill ITX PCB though I
imagine space was a serious concern here
this thing is pretty dense with features
a soos managed to cram the eight pin all
the way into the immediate upper
left-hand corner of the board this is
actually an ideal spot and follow suit
with traditional ATX counterparts and
though it might be difficult in some ATX
cases to actually connect the eight pin
to this header to the right of the fan
headers you'll find a two RGB LED strip
ports one is certainly necessary but I
feel as though this add-on header here
should really be replaced with a fourth
fan hub most RGB kits include splitters
anyway so I wouldn't be as concerned
with LEDs as I would be with fan support
at this point two Ram slots run along
the right side of the board with an
array of boot status LEDs aligned and
just above this is like dr debug on a
simpler scale and can be very useful
when diagnosing troublesome Hardware the
24-pin connector laid just to the south
along with
iö and speaker headers if you're into
hearing beeps every time you boot your
PC there aren't many SATA 3 ports on
this board I'm counting for all of them
upward-facing and only two of them are
planted along the right side of the
board
Asus have also managed to cram both USB
2 and USB 3 headers under this board
with just enough space on the bottom
right corner for the stand off and screw
there are two MDOT two ports on this
board as well the one integrated into
the sound card runs with four PCIe lanes
and can also be used with SATA drives
the second one located on the back of
the board is PCIe only so you can't use
SATA MDOT 2 drives with this back port
here in case you're wondering why your
drive isn't being read by the way if
you're wondering where the HD audio port
resides it's right here built into the
second PCB layer and wedged under the
Wi-Fi card cable management might be an
issue with this one and it'll look
pretty weird having a cable run above
everything below it I actually made it
to squeeze mine between this up upward
heat spreader here and kept things a
little more concealed by the way in case
you're interested in an array of RGB
LEDs runs down the right side of the
board along the back for a subtle under
glow in most cases it actually looks
pretty great the Strix logo centered
below the CPU socket also lights up
though it's more subdued overall I think
this is one of the sexiest I TX boards
on the market not just from an LED
standpoint but also from a heatsink and
just overall aesthetic appeal point of
view this it's just a good-looking board
nothing anyone's gonna deny that so
that's a rundown of the motherboards
features and now let's talk overclocking
thermals and stability you'll find six
power phases to the left of the socket
with a fairly large AVR a mosfet
heatsink to keep things nice and cool
and while this is nothing in comparison
to some of the dual eight pin EPS x4 70
ATX motherboards on the market six
phases should be plenty in this form
factor for decent overclocks or a native
XFR and we've proven that here power
consumption and delivery as well we'll
reveal shortly more comparable to ATX
counterparts so there's no unneeded
power draw from a smaller form factor
the CPU we used to run our test was the
horizon 7 2700 the lower TDP brother of
the 2700 x in all reality it's actually
the better buy in my book overclocking
differences if existent at all are
minimal and even exif are to boost and
bring the cheaper chip to within 5
percent or so of the competition from
Forman standpoint the only tangible
thing you're really forgoing here is the
beefier prism cooler again if you're
buying an aftermarket cooler doesn't
matter but if you're using the stock
cooler that could be the difference for
ram we're using a 16 gigabyte kit of
team group Nighthawk RGB modules so
there are rising specific kits who can
buy for optimal overclocking support but
I'm using these to prove a point that
Rison second gen cpus have significantly
higher memory frequency tolerances
conducive in the gamers case to higher
frame rates
thanks to infinity fabric dependencies i
used a deep cool captain 240 X to keep
temps in check the black color scheme
going on here is looking especially sexy
in my book the Strix x4 70 eyes accents
are the icing on the cake
I do recommend however running other
fans in your case to actively cool your
VRMs things were perfectly fine in the
NZXT h200 eye with an exhaust fan at the
back manual overclocking even up to 4.2
gigahertz across all cores yielded some
of the best of erm temps i've ever seen
in an ITX motherboard these were
confirmed by the way both by manually
probing and in software and the
transitioning soundly into our next
topic overclocking I didn't notice any
immediate hiccups reaching 4.2 gigahertz
I literally hopped into BIOS all Asus
biases are pretty much the same at this
point and I love that they're all very
just uniform you can expect to have the
same bios regardless of which chips that
you're going for whether it be on Intel
site or AMD side hitting 4.2 gigahertz
straight up and I also boosted the DRAM
frequency I'm pretty sure I just
activated XMP and then straight up reset
saving those features sure enough
confirmed 4.2 gigs across all cores it
was a piece of cake with this board here
to be clear though you may not even want
to overclock XF r2 does a pretty
excellent job scaling core frequencies
with workload and some cores might
actually hit higher than four point two
gigahertz especially when you're gaming
in the game is only utilizing maybe four
cores max so you might actually get a
higher framerate using just X of R 2 and
not manually overclocking that's subject
for a different video but for now if you
want to overclock you certainly can with
this board another major concern of any
Rison one serious CPU was memory
overclocking even just hitting
out-of-the-box ram frequencies was a
challenge with my 1700 X X n people to
turn on regardless of the motherboard or
memory
kit used but with the 12 nanometer stuff
things have dramatically improved I
discussed a lot of this in my 2700 X
review check out right here but in a
nutshell you aren't likely to deal with
the same memory overclocking issues and
this time around and that's definitely a
good thing
Maya nighthawk Ram kit hit thirty-two
hundred megahertz without a hitch and
that's actually overclocked just a bit
on the asus strix x4 70 i gaming I
imagine things would be the same for
other kids as well speaking of which
let's throw this g.skill tried and seek
it into the mix same thing so yeah no
problems reaching up to thirty six
hundred megahertz with this board which
is actually higher than the advertised
frequency limit on the box so very
impressed here not gonna complain at all
so you can probably tell I'm pretty
happy with the sports performance and
its features now it comes in at around
200 USD which is fair I think
considering the quality and attention to
detail here one of the best I think on
the market x4 70 eye boards my only
qualms 3 fan hubs and an awkward HD
audio location 2 small details that
aren't likely to sway you one way or the
other also when I overclocked I didn't
touch the voltage preset so it was set
to auto and I watched how this
motherboard was managing voltage
throughout different workloads and it
actually did pretty well it was around a
comfortable range I think I would have
said it to myself so some of them tend
to just throw way too much voltage this
one didn't do that and I was surprised
because a lot of them in the past half
so two possibly new BIOS revision took
care of that but just something to check
out if you decide to buy this board and
a 2700 or 2700 X 4 now if you want a
board like the one you've seen in this
video check the links in the video
description for several aces X 470
motherboards in various form factors
from I TX all the way up to full sized
ATX if you're looking to build a small
and compact a core 16 thread machine
though with a reliable and clean looking
motherboard this one right here the RG
Strix x4 70 I gaming is the one that I
would get it gets two thumbs up in my
book and for obvious reasons let me know
