yep you heard that right hump net is the
storage and server company I personally
use for securing data and videos like
these off-site and out of mind
they're offering one terabyte VPSs to
the first 200 science studio subscribers
for only 20 bucks a month they've
undercut industry pricing and it will
not last long this is more than just a
cloud service folks you'll have root
access and full control over your
personal data click the link in the
video description for more details this
is my favorite case of all time I can
say that with 100% confidence and
certainty because well it's my opinion
and you don't have to agree but this is
one of the best looking cases one of the
easiest to build in and it's been
improved even further with tempered
glass meet the fractal design define C
tempered glass edition
so yes this is my favorite case of all
time and I look back way back in some
prehistoric PC cases to make sure that
nothing came close to this if you're
wondering where I score this compared to
the NZXT s340 lead and the fantex p400s
tge
I would say this was number one the fan
texture case is number two and the s340
elite is number three see this video
right here for more details on the
latter two so in this video very briefly
I'm gonna talk about why I think this
case is the best case you can currently
buy on the market both in terms of the
building experience and the theme and
looks overall much of this info has
already been covered in my fractal
design mesh fic review the define see
though was the original chassis and it
does compromise airflow just slightly
but for the sake of extra hardware
compatibility so in this case you can
actually wedge fans between the chassis
and the front panel which is an optimal
for airflow obviously you will suffer a
few degrees of higher core temperatures
for your CPU and GPU if you have a
full-on loop in here but that's why you
would want to do this if you want room
for a reservoir and a pump and radiators
and fans all in the front of this case
because it's not very long then you're
probably gonna have to resort to pushing
fans in between the chassis and the
front panel but even if you're not a
hardcore water cooling PC enthusiast not
that I blame you
you could still fit just all air-cooled
parts in here and have plenty of room to
spare also cable management is a dream
thanks to this indention on the right
side of the back panel so you have
plenty of room to stash your cables all
of these tie straps are included and the
inclusion of a basement means well you
can hide anything else down here and
it'll still look pretty from the front
speaking of the basement there is a
panel up near the front you can remove
to allow for support up to a three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiator
fan counterpart and up top there are two
fan slots for 120 s or 140 s you could
also manage to put a 240 Mille a IO in
here or a 240 milliliter radiator with
fans but I don't recommend 280 because
you might have some RAM clearance issues
and at the back of the case another 120
millimeter brackets the radiators fans
should be a problem back here also I
should note that there are two fans
included with the case two 120
millimeter fans from fractal design and
these actually are pretty solid at low
rpm although they do get pretty loud at
higher rpms that tends to be the case
with case fans in general though they
are not going to be you know
top-tier fans by any means I will say
though that they are white finned and
the brackets at the back of the case
covering the PCI slots are also white
which is a bit weird I would still
change those to black they are black in
the mesh if I see at the top of the case
IO is exactly the same as it was for the
regular define see so we have a
headphone jack microphone Jack a reset
switch power button and 2 USB 3.0 ports
you also get the mod you've any 280mm
your fan or up to that bracket up top
and this is actually removable you get
an included mesh cover if you want to
stash fans up there so you get decent
airflow and maybe an exhaust setup too I
get the hot air out of your case I'm a
huge fan of this SSD tray very easy to
remove with a single thumb screw that is
attached to the bracket so it won't go
anywhere it's just a really innovative
way to take advantage of space that is
otherwise wasted dust is really never an
issue with fractal design cases in this
form factor there's a very large dust
filter spending the height of the case
up front and there's also a large one
down below that spans the length of the
case so all the way back to the power
supply so you can orient your power
supply downward not worry about dust
getting sucked up into there and it does
support full length power supplies also
keep in mind this harddrive trade down
here which is it's nice that they have
it it is removable which is also a good
thing so if you want to fit a custom
movement you put a pump here instead of
a hard drive than the tray is very easy
to remove with four screws down below
it's a very sturdy case as well quite
heavy feels premium and it's lifted off
the ground thanks to four rubberized
feet for adequate PSU breathing room if
you really want to know what a PC looks
like inside of the fractal design define
see it's kind of a weird tongue twister
there define design see then check out
my Andromeda PC build series I'm pretty
sure it's a series I don't know maybe I
did it in one video now but it's right
here uses purple coolant kinds of purple
gray black vibe and it was built in the
regular define C so just replace that
front panel with a tempered glass panel
and that's basically what a build will
look like in here anything for the most
parts gonna look gorgeous in here as
long as you don't throw a weird like ITX
motherboard inside this full a lot full
tower but it's a mid tower ATX case this
case really has it all and that's why
the define C is my favorite computer
case of all time it's the perfect form
factor for me not too large for a mid
tower and it's got a non tinted
tempered glass front panel I love the
fact that it's not tinted that's a huge
pet peeve of mine cable management
should
not be difficult at all thanks to the
indention on the back panel and airflow
is going to be decent not the best but I
will take form over function in a case
like this now if you guys really want to
hear some negatives like if you really
want to hear a negative thing about my
favorite case of all time I'm gonna I'm
gonna really try hard here it's gonna
sound pretty stupid some of these points
are gonna be rather moot but you have to
know going into this that this case will
only support up to ATX motherboards noe
ATX because of the intention of the back
panel I'm also not a fan of the fact
that the motherboards standouts are not
pre-installed it's just an extra step
okay yeah I'm a little lazy but I would
like to have those already there I don't
know anyone who's gonna want to use an
ITX motherboard in a case like this even
micro ATX would look a little silly
so I recommend going full-on ATX for the
motherboards here if you want a micro
ATX version fractal does offer a fractal
to find mini C strictly for micro ATX
motherboards but I think of one more
thing that's negative one more thing
it's all I want just want one more
negative attribute it's really difficult
to find something to pick on here I
would say actually you know what the
power button this glows blue I find that
kind of distasteful make it white it
just matches things better than blue
does if you have a red thing going on in
here and a blue power LED it's just a
little off but despite those really
cheesy negatives this is my favorite
case by far I think it looks the best I
think it's priced appropriately and I
think that it's the easiest case I've
ever built it the fine s was also very
easy to build in because it was a bigger
form factor even though it was still ATX
but it didn't have a basement
I think the basement inclusion that
defines C makes it the most compelling
offer as always you can find the
tempered-glass edition of the define C
linked in the video description along
with its non-timber glass counterpart if
you're just interested in a cheaper
option the measure if I see is also down
there along with the defined mini C for
our micro ATX builders if you like this
video or at least appreciate the honesty
let me know they giving this one a
thumbs up I do appreciate it be sure to
