single Craigslist ad in this video it's
still gonna be in the I read playlists
but it's only gonna be one ad because
this one is just so cringy like it is
the worst PC Craigslist ad I've ever
found and I want to give a shout out to
the person on Twitter who sent this link
to me intensity to the sixth power at
aka intensity he said wow what a deal
and I clicked on it I was like okay it's
gonna be you know maybe wonder he's
asking maybe five hundred bucks or
thousand dollars at the most more than
he should for his gaming PC well I
clicked on it and I was greeted with
this beautiful thing right I mean I'm
not gonna take anything away from his
style here it's a clean build he's got a
really nice build in here he's taken his
time it's got a nice color coordination
going on and he spected out
appropriately and he's gonna i7 8700 k
32 gigs of ram and he has a gtx 980ti so
he's built the system right but what he
hasn't done right is priced the thing
now he wants $6,000 for this on a public
forum and mind you he's also posted this
exact same ad in the facebook
marketplace so you could go there if you
want to look at it as well get more
insight into what's going on with this
thing but it's just so outrageous that I
wanted to bring it to your attention
because people do this and the way that
he tries to sell this is just plain up I
mean he's almost trying to bully you
into buying this and I just think it's a
terrible tactic so let's look at what he
wrote in the description and then we'll
do a price break down and see just how
far off the mark he is
by the way Before we jump into the
details I want to show a few more
pictures of his build it's very clean I
can't take it away from him he took his
time here not and it does look really
nice
excellent cable management a good you
know RGB color combo here with the fans
and the strips and a graphics card the
AI oh you know this is this is I'm not
taking away from his build his build
looks really good but the price isn't
and you'll see that when we go through
the specs here so I 780 700 K 32 gigs of
ram 128 gig a.m. to 500 gig Evo SSD a 2
terabyte hard drive gigabyte Z 370 board
8 100 I cooler 1000 yd+ from EVGA we
have a 1080 Ti from EVGA a corsair 5 70
X course there are a GB fans with
controller of course there are GB strips
with RGB controllers of course there are
GB mousepad we have a Logitech G 9/10
keyboard a Razer Naga epic chroma
keyboard
it's include two keyboards it's a little
weird and then a 34 inch 4k Asus ultra
wide LED display okay I mean like he's
including that right that's a pretty
nice panel we'll look up the price I'm
not sure what the MSRP on that is and
then of course at the end he's got a you
know hype it up with the professional
put together and built this will play
any game 4k max with ease and no issues
okay I'm you know he's got a great combo
but in all of my testing playing at 4k
with max settings is still gonna put a
lot of stress on that 1080 TI I mean you
know most games you could probably get
by with playing on pretty high settings
in 4k but max settings I'm not too sure
about that especially with some you know
pretty intensive titles I'd say witcher
3 4 k max is probably gonna be a little
too much just one off the top of my head
you know but so when you see statements
like this and ads just be a little leery
you know this this is a just just a
general statement that's very vague but
also at the same time very specific in
his case right and you want to just
steer clear these for the most part and
then of course $6,000 cash firm no less
in all caps so he's pretty serious about
his asking price
no i will not part out sell
separate I will not take payments EBT
PayPal whatever you have cash money 6k
no less do not give me any BS of oh I
can build this and that for this build
it yourself I do not need to sell just
here to entertain offers if you don't
have the cash go to Walley world and buy
yourself a pre-built system for 300 and
have it break in 14 months and cry you
know I understand to an extent right
people who lowball you just to lowball
you see they can take advantage of you
they can get pretty annoying so that's
why you say things like firm or you know
I'm unpretty firm on the price or OBO or
trades are not accepted like you try to
give the potential buyer like a scope
right a frame of reference for what they
should be asking in return for this if
they're gonna try to counter your
initial offer and that's normal that's
that's healthy it's okay to have a back
and forth on Craigslist you know that
that's how both people come out happy
that's how you make a sale but when you
come out saying $6,000 cash and I can
tell you right now he's asking for
literally twice the price he should be
for this then and then you say firm no
less in all caps and then you go about
making fun of people who can't afford it
by saying they should go to Walley world
and by themselves pre bail pcs for 300
bucks that will break in 14 months which
I would also argue as a stretch of his
imagination then you're just being an
asshole so what we're gonna do here is
build his exact PC and we're gonna give
him the benefit of the doubt we're gonna
build everything at MSRP and assume he's
he's just gonna charge his MSRP for it
and then maybe he'll charge us a little
extra for Windows 10 if he's including
that he didn't say was and then maybe a
little extra for the for the labor
but if he's trying to do this you know
as a from a business standpoint then he
should make that clear up front if he's
trying to get six grand for it no
business is gonna operate marking up
computers by that much so we got the
8700 K we're gonna do an H 100 I v2
there it is here it is gaming seven yep
here we go 200 bucks I know it's not
Corsair ramp we're just gonna say it's
Corsair Dom Platts just because those
are gonna be pretty expensive and
premium so again we'll give him another
benefit of the doubt now he doesn't list
what kind of m2 SSD he has here I'm just
gonna assume that it's just some average
duck you know he's asking 60 grand for
this you'd think he'd be a little more
specific about the parts to justify his
asking price but he's very vague so I'm
not gonna assume it's anything expensive
that's why I've got an a data 128 gig
I'm not - SSD here for roughly 50 bucks
and then I'm gonna add a 500 gig Samsung
Evo and then he also has a 2 terabyte
hard drive let's just say it's a WD blue
all right now his card he's got an EVGA
1080 TI pretty sure it's this top one
here for the 1-3 gaming icx so we're
gonna add that it's $1000 and then his
case it's got a 570 X and power supply
EBG a 1,000 watt it's gonna be the
supernova I presume the thousand want P
to actually the same power supply 280
bucks the monitor let's see if we can
add this and he's got 34 40 by 1440 I'm
presuming that's what he means by 4k
ultra wide cuz I don't know of any 4k
ultra lights that are mainstream like
this from Asus
so let's assume he's talking about 34 40
by 1440 and it's a 34 inch so we're
gonna have to kind of just do this
manually cuz I don't know what the name
of the monitor is he didn't put the
model number a 34 inch it's probably
this one let's see well there's two of
them here it's an rog swift and does he
have a picture of it no it is not 4k so
soldier white i'm just let's just say
it's the more expensive one I'm not sure
but it's one of these two 434 inch
monitors so let's let's say that one now
but you can see here are a total price
for this build is this includes the
worst case scenario for both the monitor
and the RAM is $4,000 that's a lot of
money especially for that monitor an
$1,100 for the monitor is pretty pretty
steep like I said you can get the other
34 inch monitor for a lot less than that
on $700 so for this one here 1,100 bucks
that's a lot of money that means that
our price here is definitely going to be
a bit higher than we would expect it to
be but the build itself isn't gonna cost
any more than about $3,000 and when you
go onto a site like Craigslist searching
for a PC you might not be looking for a
monitor
or you might not want to pay MSRP for a
monitor at that and that's the thing I
want you guys to keep in mind here he's
asking for above MSRP by a solid what
sixty percent and and this is just you
know he it's almost like he's just kind
of throwing it out there like oh yeah
I'll just see if any suckers gonna come
along and pay this and you know from an
ethical standpoint I don't agree with it
but if you're gonna look at this just
from like a bit you know a business
standpoint right to make money if you're
willing to take advantage of people at
least be specific about your components
first off and then don't be a jackass in
the bottom paragraph where you talk
about people who can't afford your
system need to go to walmart and spend
only three hundred dollars by the way
there's some pretty sweet pre-built at
Walmart and Best Buy that aren't gonna
cost three hundred bucks that might cost
six seven eight hundred dollars but
they're not gonna break in fourteen
months just because something's you know
manufactured or sold at Walmart doesn't
mean that it's automatically trashed and
you can tell he's probably already got a
lot of flack for this on face book
marketplace and probably even Craigslist
on a cell phone just because he is so
blunt here about do not give me any BS
of oh I can build this myself for this
and that he's either admitting guilt
right as to why is that he's charging so
much he's pretty much admitting that
he's charging way more than he should
here which is kind of funny and at the
same time he's gonna insult you and and
you know the preceding sentences here
with this just this is just so bad
Walley world for $300 if you don't have
the cash okay so if you can't afford a
six thousand dollar PC all you can
afford is a 300 dollar pre-built from
Walmart at this point I would just say
if you're gonna spend you know two or
three thousand dollars on a build like
this and then pay another two or three
thousand dollar premium because someone
else built it for you call in a sick day
take one day and lose two hundred bucks
from your job and learn how to build a
PC so you can save yourself two or three
thousand dollars in the long run so you
don't fall for like this but here's how
it is at the end of the day he can
charge whatever he wants for his PC he
can charge six thousand dollars he can
charge ten thousand dollars would have
made for a better video on my part but
he can charge whatever he wants the
thing is though he might not sell it for
the price he's asking and that's the
risk he's willing to take he says he
doesn't need to sell it and then you
know he's pretty upfront about that too
so maybe he won't sell it and he'll
still be just as happy as
he had sold it but I only can be a
little more happy if he got an extra
$2,000 on top of what he spent to build
this thing this is just I can't help but
kind of just smirk and laugh at this the
way that he portrays himself in the ad
is just so bad I I hope that he at least
if he watches this video decides to not
be a prick in in the description and
then maybe he'll have a slightly better
chance of selling the PC it's just a
turn-off the way he hasn't written but
don't go harassing him on Craigslist
trying to call him up don't you know try
to message him on Facebook marketplace
just leave it at this you know I think
the exposure here is enough to maybe
convince him to reevaluate the way he's
trying to sell this PC and at the end of
the day this is just more or less a
learning process for the rest of us who
are willing to just stop and admire the
mistakes of other people this one is
that this is a pretty big mistake but I
guess at the end of the day if he sells
that it's not really a mistake for him
it's just a mistake for the person who
bought it again another reason why this
video exists if you like this one if you
think this ad is just hilarious and
worth the video let me know by giving
this one a thumbs up I appreciate it
thumbs down for and the opposite be sure
