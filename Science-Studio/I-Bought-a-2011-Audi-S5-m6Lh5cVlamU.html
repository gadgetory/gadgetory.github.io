my 2011 Audi s5 it is sporting a 354
horsepower v8 engine are a tronic
six-speed automatic transmission and an
optional sport differential for added
fun in the corners so that won't do me
much good in the city now before I say
anything else I was not going to
purchase a 6-speed manual not only are
they difficult to find but they're a
major pain to drive in dense cities like
mine was to be you drive stick know that
I'll trade raw mechanics for ease of use
any day of the week especially for a car
like this but of course your preferences
may differ from mine I want to apologize
for the wind I know that's really rough
on you guys I do apologize for that but
I bought an Audi s5 2011 v8 4.2 liter
and it's fitted with pretty much
everything you can want in the car it's
not the prestige model which is like the
highest end model that you could get a V
S 5 and the time but it does have all
the extra things that if prestige would
have apart from push-to-start which is
kind of weird the guy I bought the
Premium Plus model and then you put
everything that the prestige has in it
in it except for push-to-start so I
wonder how much that cost at the time
but this is my car it has about 67,000
miles on it I just bought it I'm not
leasing it do anything weird obviously
it's a used car so I kind of had no
choice but to buy it but there are a few
things that I do want to show you that
I'm not going to talk about in the
original audio overlay because know you
kinda have to see some of these things
to really get the idea across so let's
take a tour no joke I think this is one
of the best-looking sport coupes and
money can buy but it also isn't too
flashy to where it draws too much
unwanted attention speaking of which I
paid less than you probably think before
I reveal the figure though consider this
it's a six year old car with around
67,000 miles even hit a deer at one
point in its life somewhere in New
Jersey I mean check it out the CARFAX
literally says it hit a deer there's a
first time for everything
so the price I paid was exactly
twenty-two thousand seven hundred and
sixty US dollars excluding tax title and
license I'll be registering the car in
Florida however I purchased the car here
in Lafayette Louisiana at the local
outtie dealer excellent folks over there
by the way you should check them out if
you're in the market soafter TTL I'll be
looking at around twenty-five thousand
dollars at a pocket
if I do say so myself I certainly could
have gotten one for cheaper but at the
expense of additional mileage and these
cars aren't the friendliest to repair
howdy parts are in general expensive so
we'll see how long I can go with this
one before I get a shell out more cash
off to the side you'll find custom
accented mirrors power everything by the
way VA badges on the left and right
panels and single driver passenger doors
this is a coupe after all this is the
meteor gray color from Audi by the way I
like its hint of blue not too flashy but
not the typical white black or grey
either now these are not soccer rims
these are Hartman rims and I can see why
the previous owner chose these if you're
not aware the rs5 features the
five-spoke I believe 20-inch rims these
are only 19 but I'm not going to bother
wasting extra money to increase the size
by an inch I think they look perfectly
fine the way they are in fact this is
one of the only like non-stock rim kits
that I would have applied to this car
and I like the fact that the previous
owner went with the rs5 design now this
is the stock s5 grille but seeing as
though the previous underside do with
the rs5 rims I think what I'm going to
do is swap this grille with the rs5
grille which is actually more like a
mesh design there isn't this ugly front
license plate holder there I mean this
is this is all just disgusting so I
think I'm going to replace this whole
thing it's not the Alli badge and it
does still have the s5 badge but it'll
just be a mesh grille and civic I think
will make this car look a bit more
aggressive now one of the key physical
differences between the s5 and something
I'm sure you've seen quite a bit on the
road the Audi a5 is the quad exhaust
system that's just a split h pipe so you
have two exhaust ports on each side and
that's just the result of having a v8
now the v6 supercharged engine and the
2013 and up models do the exact same
thing but other than just looking at the
badge this is one of the ways you can
tell whether or not you're sporting an
s5 or an a5 the taillights are stylish
and unique the dual exhaust tips on
either side give it a subdued gtfo
appeal and the subtle badges keep it on
the deal for anyone who isn't an Audi
enthusiast I mean you wouldn't think
much of this car just driving behind it
even though it is sporting a solid v8
engine with sports trim and a mean growl
but that's what I enjoy most about this
car apart from the inconsiderate pricks
who recklessly disregard any in all cars
next to which they park you
we'll have any problem with unwarranted
attention and looky-loos it's just a
sports coupe no different than a BMW
335i or even a Chevy Camaro SS in that
regard though I wouldn't trade this
interior for any other one of the cool
things about this car that I did not
know when I was inquiring about the s5
is how much trunk space it has this has
got to be one of the largest trunks and
a coupe that I've ever seen and it goes
way back here it just keeps going
further and further back let's see if I
can get it in I'm actually gonna try to
get in there oh yeah yeah we could
definitely make this work oh this is a
subwoofer right here yeah there's room
for about three people so if you're a
kidnapper this is the car for you I'm
not endorsing that statement but just
matter of fact now one of the key
features about this particular model
that I really like that maybe you want
to buy this car we're the red leather
seats now you can get these seats in a
variety of colors you can get the white
ones the black ones even like the kind
of burgundy orange color but this is
just the straight-up
red leather and I know that's a bit
exotic and a bit ostentatious in most
cases but for a car like this I think
that it just makes the interior pop
brings everything to life and just all
on all makes me enjoy driving in the car
a bit more than just regular black
leather seats what it sounds a bit gaudy
but trust me in person these look pretty
cool the prominent s5 floor badge gives
way to a crazy cool interior that's sure
to impress even other Audi owners red
leather seats complimentary carbon fiber
trim Audis trademark MMI interface and
driver position two navigation system I
think is pretty cool check this out I
was actually programming my voice so
that the system would recognize me when
I was talking over a bunch of others in
the car 2 3 1 4 2 3 1 4 navigate the
John Smith navigate to John Smith 9 0 2
3 9 0 2 3 a few things I'm thinking
about changing I might swap a steering
wheel for the flat bottom 2013 steering
wheel just because this one's a bit
bulkier not as appealing in that sense
and I might change the shifter as well
and you can't see it I'm inside because
the wind is terrible outside but that
shift lever there is kind of just bland
I think I might upgrade that to the 2013
model as well a weird core
about this car the fact that the sunroof
isn't really a sunroof it's actually
more like a moonroof and the backend of
it just kind of lifts up for extra
ventilation I guess that's the only
function there because of the XM
satellite radio antenna whatever this is
back to your radio antenna you can't
slide the glass back like the newer
models can I think that's the excuse
that Audi was using at the time so we're
stuck with just this one inch of
clearance here now one of the only
issues this car I had when I bought it
was the hood lever is just dead there's
no way to keep this cropped up there is
no just mechanical lever that you can
use to keep the hood open so if I want a
cleaning engine which it clearly has not
been cleaned in several several months I
have to have somebody hold the hood open
or I can try to do it like this but
that's really awkward so I get that baby
back to outies quattro technology for a
second as someone who's driven GTRs and
r8 on many occasions this feeling is
really no different the pool is almost
instantaneous wait a minute does an
olive trap system pull or push you or
both well most of the power is sent to
the rear wheel so let's say push this s5
is packing nearly as much torque as it
is horse powering can propel you from 0
to 60 in roughly 5 seconds flat with the
automatic transmission a little under 5
if you want to sound really cool 4.9 for
whatever intentional launches are
insanely fast but the added weight from
Audi's Quattro system definitely slows
or down at higher speeds nonetheless
it's a thrill to drive pretty much
anywhere man I'm always trying to catch
the next red light now I'm going to
attempt to get into the back seats I
know that it's possible but it's a
difficult process
there are ways where I can get to the
position he's get to all right and over
got to keep going
let's see that is far forward is that
seat rolls wow they are not they're not
concerned about large people getting
into the back of these cars oh it's
actually quite roomy and the reason for
that is because the car isn't just like
a steady slope to the trunk it actually
has kind of like an uplifted back end
and you can see that from like a side
shot of the car so it actually gives you
a bit more Headroom than you might
expect my head you know isn't hitting
the ceiling I got about three three or
so inches so if you're about six 162
that might be the upper limit of
compatibility for backseat writing
anyway Wow getting out is just as
difficult getting in I'm serious though
if you weigh like around 200 pounds
good luck fitting between these I can't
believe it doesn't rolling more forward
than that I'm finding new things about
my car even in this video when I first
saw this car on cars calm I did not
realize it was right down the road for
me I have 500 mile radius
turned on literally a 10 minute drive to
the local addi dealer which was actually
just built a few years ago I don't know
what to call that that sounds like fate
to me there aren't any dealers in the
Panama City area though so any official
maintenance will have to be done in
Mobile Alabama that's you know three
hour drive let's hope and pray that a
trip like that isn't warranted any time
soon
so you know the routine thumbs-up
thumbs-down subscribe if you haven't
already and tell me in the comments what
you think i should name her this is
