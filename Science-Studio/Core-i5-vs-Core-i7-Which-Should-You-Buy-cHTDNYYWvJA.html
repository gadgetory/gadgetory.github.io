the Intel platform has been the core i5
for pretty much the entirety of PC
gaming existence most core i5s provide 4
physical cores plenty of l3 cache and
most of the time fairly modest clock
speeds but let's not forget the older
brothers of these generations the core
i7s to the respective core i5s while
most people regard core i7s as developer
CPUs for people like myself who do more
editing and things of that sort
over gaming RI 7 still a viable option
for gamers who play games way more than
they do anything else let's find out so
very quickly let's address the test
bench that we'll be using for both of
these CPUs now as they are both from the
same Haswell generation we will be able
to use the exact same test bench for
both our core i5 and core i7 variants if
you have seen our 2 or bers 4 core cpu
that I uploaded a while ago then that
test bench really hasn't changed much
since then if you haven't seen that
video yet you're curious about that go
ahead and click the link here and yeah
be entertained
we paired both processors with the exact
same as drug z97 extreme for LG 1150
motherboard and 8 gigabytes and 240
gigabyte variants of crucial tactical
ddr3 clocked at 1600 megahertz with a
cast latency of 8 want to go back to
1600 megahertz because I really like low
latency stuff pretty cool we'll also be
using a GTX 970 for our gaming
benchmarks in particular this particular
variant of the 970 is the AC strict
version and we've left those frequencies
in stock so whatever they came in out of
the box as we haven't messed with us at
all do you remember the stock
frequencies work yeah I don't either
one more thing I should know before we
jump straight into the benchmarks is
that both are 4690k and our 4790k are
clocked at 4.6 gigahertz respectively
and we're both being water-cooled by the
exact same coarser h9t all-in-one water
cooler so let's get into the benchmark
CPU synthetics first
so in all honesty nothing about these
tests and particulars should have been
surprising the core i7 has some serious
performance gains over the core i5 and
that's due mostly to the fact that the
core i7 has hyper-threading whereas the
core i5 does not but how does this
translate into friends per second is the
core i7 going to give you that much of
an edge over the core i5 especially when
you consider the fact that the core i7
is $100 more on average than the core i5
let's find out with these next sets of
benchmarks
you
okay if I'm being completely honest here
I've had the core i5 for about three or
four weeks now and I've had the core i7
for only a few days but I've gained
plenty on this new machine since its
purchase and honestly I don't see that
much of an improvement I mean if you
just get a core i5 and a really awesome
GPU graphics card I should say the GPU
is just the chip inside the graphics
card you're going to be just fine a core
i5 is not going to severely bottleneck
any graphics card that you throw at it
at this point in time unless you you
know go all out with some tight nexus or
something in SLI I would say that for
most gamers who expect the game anywhere
between 1080p and 4k with just one
monitor a Core i5 and something like a
GTX 980 970 maybe an SLI something like
that or r9 390 or 390 X on AMD side will
be just fine for all of your gaming
needs so situations in which I would
recommend the core i7 over the core i5
would be in the case of video editors
photo editors music editors pretty much
anything with editor at the end of it
and maybe some programs like AutoCAD if
you use that maybe you're an engineer
those kinds of programs will definitely
benefit from the added threads but if
you're a casual gamer or even a
professional gamer I just personally
don't see the viability in purchasing an
i7 for 100 to 200 even $1,000 more than
a core i5 hyper threading and even
additional cores past maybe six just
really don't give you that much of an
added benefit in game so the law of
diminishing returns is definitely
applicable in this case
so if you're just a gamer you don't do
much editing at all that's not really
what you're into
stick with the core i5 save that money
and invest that save money into a more
powerful graphics card you will not be
disappointed
this is science studio thanks for
learning with
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
