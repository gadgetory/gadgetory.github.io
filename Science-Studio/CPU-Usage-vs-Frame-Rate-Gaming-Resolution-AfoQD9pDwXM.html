there and I realize after my last upload
covering core i7 gameplay that quite a
number of you were convinced that lower
resolutions result in higher CPU usage
so I'll cut right to the chase 100%
false there is not the tiniest shred of
evidence to suggest that CPU usage
increases as resolution decreases that
makes no logical sense period by the way
I ran a poll on Twitter asking followers
what they thought about CPU usage and
resolution and it appears many of you
believe this as well but not to worry
that's what this video is for
I am so frankly sick and tired of people
who know next to nothing about a topic
or who haven't researched the topic
themselves who consistently barf up
these disgusting fallacies all because
they saw someone say it in some forum
who was also likely uninformed
this is science studio so let's prove
what I just said with a bit of that
science so this claim has its roots in
something that is actually true but only
to an extent the truth being that since
lower resolutions yield higher frame
rates the CPU is taxed more
proportionally since it must prepare
several more frames more specifically
the physics and calculations to be made
within each frame a case which demands a
more parallel computing process for
which CPUs are not designed in this
scenario a lower resolution relieves GPU
stress and relieved CPU stress only
slightly in most cases and consequently
adds a bit of pressure to both since the
GPU must now stitch together and render
more frames per second and the CPU must
increase its parallel calculation rate
the GPU is designed specifically for
parallel workloads which means that this
added pressure won't impact its ability
to send frames to your TV or monitor
however since the CPU is not designed to
handle similar workloads its draws a bit
more and will benefit greatly from more
cores all other things equal this is why
an i7 is preferable for high frame rate
gaming regardless of the resolution in
question a quad-core processor with
hyper-threading will be able to more
efficiently delegate tasks within each
core thanks to an advanced scheduler
more on that in the card right here so
this is where the roads diverge we have
the truth down one end that higher frame
rates bottleneck CPUs more than GPUs on
average and the disgusting crap
uninformed morons are spewing out down
the other that lower resolutions put
more stress on the CPU because that
makes perfect sense
clearly lower resolutions all other
things equal result in lower CPU and GPU
usage overall you can monitor CPU loads
and MSI Afterburner and just check temps
every now and then for your graphics
card to confirm if your card isn't hot
it likely isn't working very hard a
consequence of lower resolutions turning
off our 60fps frame lock in these lower
resolutions result in an increased CPU
workload clearly which would place our
CPU in the neck of the bottle here but
here is the interesting part if we
compare the results that we've just seen
right here with the results
the last video where everything was run
in a resolution of 1440p basing off of
course then you can see that not much
changed even though the resolution did
peak CPU usage was nearly identical an
average CPU usage across the duration of
each test did not change by anything
more than 5% all of these games by the
way I would regard as highly CPU
intensive GTA 5 is the only one that
really isn't that's because it's a good
blend of both GPU and CPU intensive
segments in the same way gaming in 4k
dramatically impacted performance
overall things to a now induced GPU
bottleneck but did not increase CPU
usage to a great extent since the number
of frames drawn within each game were
lower on average it is worth noting
however that this relief is superseded
by the increased CPU workload brought
about by a 4k resolution so things like
physics calculations and viewing
distances in the scenario both are GPU
and CPU usage increased but the GPU is
increased by a much larger factor
theoretically we could continue this
trend of increasing in-game resolution
to the point where one of our two usages
no longer increases indicating a
bottleneck so let's sum up what we've
just seen GPU usage decreases as
resolution decreases CPU usage decreases
as resolution decreases the proportional
workload carried by the CPU increases at
lower resolutions the proportional
workload carried by the GPU increases at
higher resolutions the proportional
workload carried by the CPU increases at
higher frame rates and the proportional
workload carried by the GPU increases at
lower frame rates do you see one that
says CPU usage increases as resolution
decreases no you do not because it isn't
true period end of story
thank you science this is science studio
share this one with your friends thanks
for learning with us
