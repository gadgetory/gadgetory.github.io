the first I've ever formally reviewed on
this channel I know right away what
you're thinking got Opry gold PC I could
definitely build one for cheaper than
their asking price
well I priced everything out in PC part
picker and I'm here to tell you that a
DIY option would save you a whopping
five US dollars and that's assuming you
opt for a king one variant of Windows 10
which I know many of you feel a bit
sketchy about the operating system is
included in the price of the CyberPower
branded one as well as the keyboard and
gaming mouse which are also included
here in this list so right off the bat
not a bad start for the CyberPower VR
ready AMD gaming PC the second thing
you're probably wondering is what case
this is this is the fantex P 400
tempered glass Edition it was my
favorite mid tower case at one point
even without the glass back in the day
check out my review of it right here
just be warned it's kind of old not only
does the case come equipped with
integrated RGB lighting above and below
but cyber powers included a compatible
fantex RGB LED strip that wires directly
into the color-changing button up top I
must say however this is an awkward
place for an LED strip and zip-tied to
the basement at that now let's move on
to specifications and AMD FX 8350 I know
right away you're thinking just bear
with me an asus 970 motherboard okay and
also subpar not a 990 FX although
granted the included cooler wouldn't get
you very far with it overclock anyway an
AMD rx 484 gigabyte graphics card with a
reference cooler a gigabytes of a data
ddr3 at 1600 megahertz a 600 watt 80
plus thermal take power supply and a one
terabyte Toshiba hard disk drive
I will admit apart from the graphics
card and the case everything else is
kinda ancient or at least subpar in
terms of optimal gaming hardware it's a
budget oriented gaming PC without a
doubt but of which is relying on six
year old CPU architecture a motherboard
that's older than my high school diploma
and a slightly sketchy PSU also why the
heck is there only a hard drive in here
I'd much prefer an SSD for a boot drive
along with a hard disk drive for general
storage in my opinion the extra 30 or 40
bucks would be justified it is nice to
see a CPU cooler that isn't
in a prebuilt like this but after
booting up the PC well it might as well
be it's very loud even at idle and after
tweaking the fan curve I wish something
along the lines of a cooler master hyper
t4 had been included instead they're
also about the same price the graphics
card choice is okay I would have
preferred a non-reference cooler for
this style case the card is also only a
four gigabyte model which should be
addressed accordingly but most games in
1080p and even 1440p you will stay under
this threshold there are a few
exceptions of course but for the most
part you'll be ok it'd be difficult to
max out games in 1440p anyway with these
specs especially with the CPU taken into
consideration so what does all this give
you in terms of gaming performance well
in GTA 5 and 1080p it will give you
around 95 fps do you mind the in-game
settings below the title 1440p about 87
not a large FPS decline between the two
indicating a sharp CPU bottleneck this
is because our GPU should be leveraged
more as we increase resolution we're not
saying the framerate drop and that's
because our CPU is holding its back in
the lower resolution which are three in
its graphics intensive segments leverage
the graphics card a great deal more
hence the difference between the two
resolutions here 54 FPS vs. 37
our first-person shooter in DirectX 12
battlefield 1 managed 76 fps and 1080p
69 FPS and 1440p so still a slight
bottleneck with the newer API despite
leveraging 8 threads 2 CPU by the way it
was manually overclocked to 4.4
gigahertz who wouldn't go much further
than that with the cooler included in
the CyberPower pc the computer is indeed
via already as well as advertised
I had to tone most settings at or below
high to keep the framerate up you want
around 90 fps or so in a VR experience
so what's my verdict well you could do
better you could squeeze in an i-5 along
with an SSD maybe even replace the
graphics card with a non reference model
perhaps compromise on a cheaper case I'm
not sure that tempered glass belongs in
a budget oriented gaming PC and managed
to keep the total price in the $800
ballpark that being said this PC really
isn't bad it's not future-proof although
I hate the term but it does include a
decent keyboard and mouse and a Windows
10 key everything except the monitor
so if you're looking for a no-hassle
prebuilt that doesn't break the bank
sure you should consider this one it's
honestly not that bad and if you're
considering a prebuilt in the first
place
you probably shouldn't worry about
component upgrades for the next few
years
maybe maybe an SSP upgrade I would
probably advocate for something like
that I'm sure some of you are just
waiting to leave comments about how FX
processors are outdated and how even
stock i5s can outperform them and how
you'll never ever ever ever buy an FX
processor because they're so old and so
overpriced okay I don't know about the
overpriced port I do agree with you on
everything else so this is old
architecture I've heard this argument
time and time again I would never pay
150 bucks for an FX 8350 period so that
kind of rules me out of my interest in
this PC I would never personally buy it
to straight up
but in FX 8320 e for around 60 to 80
bucks if they had thrown that CPU into
this rig and then drop the price by 80
bucks I mean just whatever the
difference would be $700 700 bucks for
this for a comparable computer would be
an even better bargain in my opinion so
I think they should have gone with the
83 20 that's probably the only major
component I would change other than
including an SSD I think then you would
have a very very competitive pre-built
PC at 700 bucks that can definitely
handle VR with that if you liked this
video be sure to give it a thumbs up
give it a thumbs down if you feel the
quit opposite or be hate everything
about life be sure to put your subscribe
button if you haven't already stay tuned
for another ITX PC build this one
featuring at KB Lake 7600 K and a
head-to-head to head-to-head comparison
between the four megalith coolers I've
been teaching for the past three or four
weeks
this is Salazar studio thanks for
