worried I'm not a fan of testing
speakers on this channel because it's
difficult to convey exactly how they
sound via video for a price tag of about
50 bucks link in the description by the
way I'd say they're slightly on the
expensive side but that's okay I know
exactly why they're doing that
be warned if you buy a pair of $20
Bluetooth wireless headphones that are
advertised as high-definition audio you
will regret your purchase the moment you
put them on we all know what terrible
headphones sound like like you listening
to something through a paper bag but
that's not what these sound like at all
I would equate these actually to
probably the same quality you get in a
typical pair of headphones included with
a flagship phone so like my galaxy s7
headphones sound a lot like these as you
as did my iPhone 7 headphones but on top
of that of course this pair of
headphones is wireless that does not
mean however that the Bluetooth
capability cuts into audio quality
that's what I was getting to a bit
earlier with the whole sheep in ear
bluetooth headphone rant if you have a
terrible Bluetooth receiver in these not
only where your audio quality diminishes
being transmitted over the air but as
it's being processed by the receiver
itself but let's not get ahead of
ourselves let's cover what's in the box
and how exactly you charge these things
so inside this cube exterior are four
major components the first of which is
of course the Bluetooth headphones and
the included case / charging dock which
I'll discuss more detail here shortly
you also get a user manual which will
come in handy when you need to connect
the headphones to a device a microUSB to
USB cable which isn't very long that was
a bit disappointing and two pairs of
interchangeable rubber domes so the case
flash charging dock is actually pretty
cool it will of course hold your
headphones you can take them wherever
you want without losing them that's
something that Lucas headphones are
notorious for and it also acts as a
charging dock in that there are four
LEDs which will notify you of current
charging status a microUSB charging hub
is to the right which will use to
connect to a computer I say computer
because while no charging brick is
included with the headphones so all you
have is the cable and the charging port
I don't know where they expect you to
plug these things into but it won't be a
wall kind of a letdown and the short USB
cable doesn't make things any easier
connecting the headphones to my phone
however was not difficult at all it took
about six seconds long as you can read
the manual you'll be good to go the
syllable logo on the sides of each acts
as a button and can be used to complete
process now back to audio quality again
I compare these to a typical
run-of-the-mill flagship headset that
you get with an iPhone 7 or a samsung
galaxy of seven I don't think that's a
bad thing if you're an audiophile though
you probably shouldn't be looking at
this video anyway because anything
that's cheap obviously is going to sound
that good but I'd save 50 bucks it's
tough to it's tough to justify 50 bucks
40 bucks is really where it where it
would shine and I think that it would
still be at a premium enough price point
to set itself apart from the $20
you know just terrible headsets but 50
bucks is still yeah it's okay the lows
are not very low but these are in
earbuds that's typical of most of those
I was able to use my s7 equalizer to
adjust that accordingly these are also
very deep in earbuds so it'll be
difficult to hear anything other than
yourself talking and that's not very
basically right now this is super weird
range is typical Bluetooth range
although I don't think you'd ever need
to be that far away from your phone and
battery life is about two hours so doing
anything extra strenuous maybe mowing
the lawn a quick gym workout would be
about as far as these would make it but
alas there is one ultimate deal-breaker
for me and these headphones I don't know
if it's a calibration issue a software
issue but every every ten minutes or so
one of the headphones will lower its
volume dramatically we're talking to
figure out a hundred percent of a
dropped of twenty percent and then
slowly work its way back up to 100%
while the other headphone stays 100% the
entire time I don't get it
but it's a big issue and it gets very
annoying it's something I've noticed
others complaining about in the review
section as well and I hate saying that
because these aren't cheap they don't
sound cheap they aren't made cheap it's
just one thing that they didn't get
right before they started rolling these
out my headset was no exception if you
are willing to take the risk though and
deal with the short USB cable and the
fact that these only last for about two
hours I guess you have nothing else to
lose worst case you can return these you
won't probably have any problem at all
because these are Amazon fulfilled so
give them a shot if you think 50 bucks
is like it's at least experimenting with
these if you haven't owned a Bluetooth
headset before these are a good entry
model if you will
don't recommend spending 200 bucks on a
Bluetooth headset if you haven't owned
one before because you need to set your
expectations accordingly I will say
though that I'm excited for where
syllabus is heading
they have a more expensive model than
I'm sure is rid of most of the mini
versions issues it's also nice to see
the syllabus wasn't willing to
compromise on quality for the sake of
price too many companies are falling
into that trap nowadays but not syllabus
you guys almost had it by the way you
almost create to be perfect
budget-friendly wireless Bluetooth
headset if you liked this video be sure
to give it a thumbs up give it a thumbs
down if you feel the complete opposite
