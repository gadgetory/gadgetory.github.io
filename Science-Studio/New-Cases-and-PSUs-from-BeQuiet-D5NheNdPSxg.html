sending us to Computex 2017 alright we
are here at Computex 2017 at the be
quiet booth and Chris himself is an arm
it hello hello yeah welcome to our booth
here at this year's show we're going to
show you a few products in a second and
yeah would be excited because we have
something really cool in store for you
all right let's go check it all out
let's get started with the white edition
of our dog bites Pro 900 you will be
able to buy this one so its q4 actually
the MSRP is just like maybe 10 bucks
more than the normal black version we
limited the worldwide amount of 2000
pieces only so we will have just a
couple of hundred units in the u.s.
actually so yeah be sure if you want to
get it you know to get it in time at
that time basically from the features is
yeah exactly the same what you have in
the black version you can invert the
motherboard which is for me like one of
the best features so if you want to
decide to put the motherboard on the
other side just do it to us the hard
drive cake is all modular and you have a
ton of radiator support for your water
cooling needs now we're with our newest
of x-l power supply as you can see it's
like it's very small yes it's a little
larger than normal SFX power supplies
that's why there is like the ending with
L because they are for large or larger
we have a 12 centimeter fan inside
instead of a normal and 8 centimeter fan
this little fella here is fully modular
80 bucks gold and it will definitely
reach North American market as well
because the normal SFX we have before we
only solve in Europe but this one is
coming to you guys will be a little more
than $100 for 500 600 watt but we are
looking forward to have this in the
market finally what do we have in the
box with every of these power supplies
is actually a bracket so if you decide
you want to use the case for normal ATX
power supplies but you want to have a
spousal support so you can just install
it with this bracket here into your
normal ATX site another new power supply
of the show is the spring power l11 as
you might know we have a 3 power 10 in
the market right now and the 11
coming this year and as you can see it's
fully modular it will be the only one we
have we won't sell it with fixed cables
anymore like we had with a straight card
10 the very cool thing about this one is
we call it cable 3 as you can see on the
inside there is no cable anymore inside
of this power supply so you know when
you have a less cable you know you have
less problems with thermals for example
you know the air can just go through
nicer and that of course extends the
reliability the lifetime of this product
so yeah this one is as I said coming
towards q4 will be roughly the same
prices I'm a little bit better as the
straight content and we are also looking
forward to get this one finally into the
market fully modular black cables
everything's great and this is a silent
link to three film following three sign
of course install as you can see it will
look really pretty so that will be very
very silent very very loud and in case
you were wondering what a PC build looks
like inside the dark Bass Pro 900 here
you go right here again a lovely PC
white is right when it comes to PC
builds in my opinion they've made it
look pretty darn good so far alright I
think that concludes our tour here of
the B slide booth thank you so much for
joining and be sure to catch Greg on the
channel with more videos and yeah I hope
for some more be quiet products as well
I know he loves the silent focus for
tomorrow forex oh yeah thank you very
much appreciate it Chris thank you
thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
