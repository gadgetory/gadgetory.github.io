comparison video and yeah the camera
angles again very weird one I'd stand
further back from this test and I would
like unless I want to be nice and low
like this anyway the emphasis is on the
two monitors at hand here so we'll be
showing you plenty of b-roll I know it's
gonna be difficult to translate on
camera what these two screens look like
in person I've done my best to calibrate
them what I think is the comfort zone
for each of these panels this one tends
to be a bit warmer than this one that
this is an IPS panel so the color
accuracy here is going to be a bit above
par whereas this one is more of the the
new-and-improved TN technology viewing
angles are much better than the older TN
stuff but it's still going to warp
colours just a little bit and you're not
going to get that excellent color
accuracy that this one here from pic co
has so what we're gonna do in this video
is narrow down the use case scenarios
for each of these panels talk about what
you should be looking for in your next
monitor depending on your work case and
these two are very different they look
similar but they're very different and
they have different target audiences so
we're going to talk about that and I'll
also talk about some of the specs you
should look out for
you're sick of seeing the same
activation watermark with your shiny new
rig snaggin OEM windows 10 pro key from
SC DQ even if you've already installed
windows 10 on your machine you can show
out a little over ten bucks for an
authentic key that'll activate your copy
click the link below and use offer code
s Studio for an 18 percent discount on
your order so let's run through the
specs of each panel first this here on
my left is the viewsonic XG 240 R it's a
24 inch 1080p one millisecond 144 Hertz
T in panel with free sync built-in and
eye care technology so it's not going to
be as hard on your eyes and then this
over here is the pixie Oh px 275 H it is
a 1440p 95 hertz IPS display and it has
beautiful color reproduction so if you
can already tell this is the gaming
monitor at least that's what they want
you to think this is targeted toward
gamers I mean you've even got RGB on the
back of this thing and you're not gonna
pay much for it I mean relatively
speaking about 240 or 50 USD is a pretty
good price for what you're getting here
1080p 144 Hertz I'm not seeing much
ghosting at all on this panel which is a
good improvement
a lot of the viewsonic panels I've had
in the past even a couple via Tec panels
I've had a terrible ghosting issues and
I'm happy to say that this one has none
of that
now the pic co panel is priced similarly
about 250 USD again but it's got a much
lower refresh rates only 95 hertz versus
144 can you tell the difference
obviously not on camera filming at 30fps
there's no ways to translate accurately
but if you are here in person yes you
will be able to tell the difference I
don't care if you've been playing
consoles your whole life or not I have I
started with a Playstation one we've
done to a ps2 then an Xbox 360 then Xbox
one now a ps4 Pro I only recently got
into PC gaming I mean about 5 or 6 years
ago and this was a huge step up for me
in the visual department and it helps
tremendously especially with
first-person shooters and this is really
where I want you to start considering
your use case because if you only play
games on your PC then a high refresh
rate panel at the expense of color
reproduction is probably the way to go
and if you're willing to stay around 250
bucks you're gonna have compromises
either way this one obviously doesn't
have the highest refresh rate but it has
amazing color reproduction this one has
a really high refresh rate but the
colors
they're a little bland let's say so if
you're worried about the fast-paced
movements getting everything picked up
on screen because again your screen is
refreshing 144 times per second then
you're gonna want the viewsonic monitors
so then let's focus on a few of the
negatives associated with such an
affordable 144 its panel like this
viewsonic XG 240 are the biggest
drawback is of course the fact that
twisted pneumatic or TN technology is
used in place of something like VA or
IPS and the way you'll know that it's a
TN panel is if you see no indication
that it's anything else on the product
page
companies like USANA can pick Co tend to
stay away from actually advertising the
fact that it's a TN panel and there's a
good reason for that it's just not a
preferred technology in terms of how
good this TN technology is I've seen
considerably worse TN technology has
improved quite a bit over the years and
viewing angles are nowhere near as bad
as they used to be what I mean by that
is you can actually read legibly text on
screen for example from nearly 170
degrees off center good luck doing that
with older TN panels but where the tan
technology starts to show its weakness
is in color reproduction especially when
viewing off-center you can see that from
Center this purple background actually
looks pretty good but when you swing
over to the side it looks way out of
whack now there of course is the
argument that well if it's my panel and
it's my PC I'm gonna be sitting right in
front of it so I'll never have to view
the panel from at far corner or
something like that and obviously yes a
trade-off though is that your friends if
they're watching from the sides might
not see the same picture you do it's
something that I think is a worthy
compromise especially in this price
category so if you're a baller on a
budget and that's one of the things
keeping you from buying TN I say you
should throw that notion out the window
and still opt for it because who cares
it's about you when you're the one
gaming that's where the px 275 H things
are going to be a bit slower 95 Hertz
versus 144 Hertz it's pretty
distinguished with with human eye and it
is not going to give you as smooth a
gaming experience especially in fast
paced games like csgo and black ops 4
ghosting is a slight issue on the pic Co
panel but again this is not the target
audience we're not intending to game on
this all the time in fact I probably
won't be doing much of it at all and if
I do it's going to be a slow paced game
maybe something like City skylines or a
park attack something like that if I'm
playing csgo or pub G or Battlefield one
I'm probably gonna want to switch to the
viewsonic panel
even though colors won't look as great
it'll be a much smoother experience and
I won't see as much ghosting thanks to
that one millisecond response time on
that X J 240 are other things you should
know about this pixel panel monitor
stand included is not very versatile
meaning if you want to turn the panel
left or right you have to swing the
entire set up including the base below
it you have a little bit of breathing
room swinging the monitor up swinging it
down however you get no play there at
all and then raising or lowering the
monitor is impossible unless you want to
use the good old classic textbook method
and just stuff books underneath the
entire stand because that's the only way
this is gonna get any higher than it is
also if you want it lower
there's no way to lower it so there's
that as for the view sonic monitor much
easier to deal with you want to raise
the monitor you just push it up if you
want to lower the monitor you just push
it down you want to swing it left or
right swing it left or right the base
stays where it is you can swing it the
other way as well about this far here so
I would say almost 45 degrees from
Center and then if you also want to
pivot the monitor up and down you have
that flexibility as well so definitely
targeted toward gamers here gamers wanna
you know they want to fine tune the
monitor position because it's it's ideal
to have this in the place that is more
comfortable for you especially when
you're playing some fast-paced games
you obviously want this where it's most
comfortable I should have to explain
this you know what I'm talking about the
pixel panel is something that I would
prefer you put on a vase amount that way
you can be more flexible if you choose
to use that for gaming otherwise if you
want to use it for content creation you
should just keep it where it is and just
adjust your seat so that you can sit
directly in front of it and not have to
work off center another thing I
appreciate about the viewsonic monitor
is the integrated AC adapter you don't
have to have an external brick hanging
from your desk if you're a cable
management junkie like me know it kind
of looks a little rough over there now
excited to remove that PC but I like
hiding my cables and it's very difficult
to hide a huge brick and the pic co
monitor and does have a huge brick I
mean it's not enormous but it's gonna be
difficult to hide needless to say I'm
not gonna talk much about the OS DS with
both of these panels because they're
pretty straightforward you get about
four or five buttons on
you get dedicated left and right or up
and down toggles as well as a dedicated
power button a menu button and an exit
button on each again it's pretty
self-explanatory and I had no trouble
navigating through either on-screen
display so if that's a concern of yours
I wouldn't sweat it especially in this
price category I'm impressed with both
but it's not something that I'm going to
take a lot of time to explain to you
because it's self-explanatory now with
all that said you might be thinking to
yourself well this seems like the
obvious choice majority of this game we
build pcs to game on right so why
wouldn't you choose this around $250 and
I would say most of you probably should
you can fine tune individual colors like
your Reds your greens and blues you can
you know improve to an extent color
reproduction on this TN panel which I
should say the technology has massively
improved again the TN tends to get a bad
rep on places like Reddit and even in
YouTube comment sections because if you
have an IPS panel TNS for peasants right
nobody wants to buy TN if you can afford
IPs and yeah IPS doesn't look better but
when you're only paying 250 bucks for a
high refresh rate panel like this and
you can still fine tune individual
colors and get it looking decent at
least I'd say this is way better value
than an IPS counterpart that's gonna
cost around 100 150 bucks more in fact
most of the gaming panels in this price
category are TN panels for a few reasons
first it's a cheap technology relatively
speaking and 2 it's easier to overclock
these panels so reaching 144 Hertz is a
breeze for this whereas with IPS
technology it's a bit more difficult and
when you move up to something like OLED
it's even more difficult so yes a
majority of you should choose this I've
got it linked in the video description
if you want to check it out I'm choosing
though the px 275 H actually I'm
choosing two of them and you'll find out
why in the next video but for what I do
a majority of and that's content create
I need accurate colors a hundred percent
srgb color spectrum in this panel that's
pretty impressive especially at this
price category and you're still getting
a 95 Hertz panel at that so it's kind of
a happy medium for me personally it's a
bigger panel I like 27 inch panels and
they're affordable there are downsides
to pretty much every monitor on the
market right you just have to weigh the
pros and cons of each and decide which
is the best value given your
use case scenario so if I had to
Ballpark it I'd say roughly 90% of you
should choose this panel right here
something comparable you something did a
great job at the XG 240 are we covered
it a bit at CES and I was excited to get
my hands on it because it did look like
a great panel for the price there are
several panels in this category so you
can shop around if you'd like but this
one has my seal of approval yeah the
colors are a bit out of whack but you
can fine tune those in the OSD and there
refresh rate and the response time are
just fantastic for this price so that's
my take what do you guys think about
both of these panels here if you really
enjoyed this video let me know I give
this one a thumbs up I appreciate it you
can find links to both of these panels
again down below in the video
description along with a few others have
tested in the past not just from pixie
overview sonic but from via Tech and
even from LG and a soos plenty of
options out there and that's a good
thing with that let me know in the
comments below if you have any questions
or concerns and what you'd like to see
next on the channel if you liked the
video thumbs up you know what to do
click that red subscribe button I'm sure
my heads looking really huge with this
camera angle right now but there's an
arm Orthodox video with very big
products so I kind of had to make do the
space I have I can't wait to move into
her house we're building soon we're
building a house and we're moving to
Orlando and I'm really excited about
that because we're gonna have so much
more space to do so many cool things on
the channel and yeah I hope you guys are
as excited as I am probably not because
it's it's not your house but I mean
you're gonna be in it at least one video
so be nice change of pace
