but this doesn't really tell the layman
much at all I mean not like vrm let's
say which stands for voltage regulator
module pretty self-explanatory in that
case the RM is regulate voltage
delivered to a processor by stepping it
down to a much safer level but pulse
width modulation is a characteristic of
certain fans in the PC realm there are
other applications that will stick to
that one because that's probably what
you've heard it first so what does it
mean and why should you look for it in
essence pulse width modulation is a
method used for imitating analog wave
patterns with a digital interface and we
can depict digital signals graphically
with lines representing either on or off
States DC voltage is depicted as a
straight line and it's y-intercept
indicates the input voltage in the
computer realm DC fans typically boast
three pin fan headers the first cable
records the fans are p.m. the second
sends the voltage typically 12 or 5
volts and the third acts as ground
these fans are typically a bit cheaper
than their PWM counterparts and are less
versatile from an RPM standpoint so
voltage fed down the second wire is
varied to control fan speeds on these
three pin fans and that's according to
the user's calibration but minimum
voltage is usually quite high meaning
that the minimum rpm for the fan won't
be very low which means that they won't
run super quiet in most cases if voltage
drops below this minimum threshold then
the fan won't spin at all but pulse
width fans are a different story rather
than varying voltage down the second
line voltage is fixed with the fourth
pin active so this fourth pin actually
control signal duration or the pulse
width and you see now where the name
comes into play and the longer the pulse
from this wire or the larger the gaps in
the pulses the lower the duty cycle
which essentially affects the RPM the
lower the duty cycle the lower the RPM
of the fan
for instance this would represent a
twenty five percent duty cycle when the
source voltage is fixed at 12 volts but
only in the on state twenty-five percent
of the time a duty cycle of 100 percent
is equivalent to the fan running at its
maximum input voltage will say 12 volts
for this example and a duty cycle of
zero percent will stop the fan
completely an important note here input
voltage is constantly applied to these
fans and the pulse width modulator acts
the switch so longer the switch is
closed and what circuits closed the
longer voltage is applied to turn the
fan on you can think of PWM in another
way too strumming a guitar so if I pluck
one string every five seconds I'll hear
the sound spike and then attenuate it
starts loud and then tapers off the
amplitude is similar to the RPM of the
fans so if you hit the fan with 12 volts
on shorter intervals or in this case if
you strum the string let's say once
every one second instead of five then
the medium has less time to attenuate
the amplitude stays higher overall and
this of course translates to the fan as
a higher rpm we can see this relation
graphically if we match up fan rpm and
voltage a first time pulse with
modulation tuned to a 50% duty cycle
looks something like this with our peak
voltage of 12 volts and in the dependent
variable that's rotations per minute
depicted here so when PWM mode is active
the corresponding fan will literally
turn on and off in essence by varying
degrees to maintain the desired rpm
that's why we can achieve such low rpms
with these fans it just occurs so
quickly that we don't see or hear it
happening and do keep in mind that these
values and recoveries will vary from fan
to fan
so in short PWM is a better alternative
to DC counterparts four pins are better
than three in this case you can achieve
significantly lower rpms thanks to
untouched voltage levels which means
quieter fan profiles overall and
multiple fans can be synced up to the
same PWM profile via fan hubs and
splitters since a constant voltage is
applied in these situations you can even
plug for pin fans into three pin headers
on your motherboard they'll just operate
in DC mode see the best of both worlds
in a worst case you don't have an extra
4 pin of your disposal they're more
versatile efficient and ergonomic and
should be strongly considered for your
next case fans I've linked several
reputable kits in the video description
below my favorite are the silent wings 3
fans both the 120 mm and 140 ml variants
they're extremely quiet a bit pricey but
they look pretty good doing it at the
same time and of course they've got to
be PWM some of them are DC so watch out
check to see if their 4 pin or three pin
fans if you like this video but should
let me know I guess one of thumbs up I
appreciate it comes down for Diop so you
click that red subscribe button if you
haven't already you can even
sponsor us if you really want to do that
when we have live streams you're gonna
start kick
more than once a week from now on
because it's an interesting way to
communicate with all of you so stay
tuned for those announcements on Twitter
and elsewhere
this is science studio thanks for
