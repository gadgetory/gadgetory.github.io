savage studio mode there are some
ridiculous PC craigslist post all over
the United States so we've got some from
Jacksonville Florida Flagstaff Arizona
Houston Texas Phoenix Arizona Chicago
Illinois a bunch of these are all
Craigslist posts that a buddy and I
found just that were just ridiculous
like these there's people either asking
way too much money or the PCs are trashy
and they're trying to pass it off as a
ultimate gaming PC so let's run through
some of these and see just how
ridiculous some of them can get okay
let's start with the bottom one here
okay so it looks like an NZXT s340 elite
and i7 7700 k a single gtx 1070 and he's
he wants $2,500 we're gonna see like
custom GPU backplate with RGB lights
bruh dude that's like a stock asus
backplate i've owned that exact card
it's not custom here we go another one I
have for sale my gaming rig is full RGB
it's spotting a GTX 1080 founders
edition graphics card able to hit over
20 100 megahertz on the course table
congratulations
16 gigabytes of ddr4 and Intel i5 7600 K
laid inside an ass roxie 270 killer
that's how high this dudes being very
gentle by how he explains he inserted
that CPU into that socket for cooling it
has six Coursera fans our DB also
included his LG blu-ray writer this PC
can handle anything you put at it I'm
able to play triple-a titles like a
battlefield 4 at Ultra settings at 4k
and hit 60fps all day long accepting
reasonable offers please no trades do
not contact me to sell me products any
company that does will be will be
prosecuted to the full extent of the law
and will be reported all I want to call
this guy so badly 24-inch monitor and
sub-woofer just in case you didn't know
he was throwing in a freaking dope sub
for $900 barely used no problems it is
in great condition I'm looking at this
first picture right now and I can tell
you this PC is not barely used are these
printouts of like his system specs and
benchmarks like he printed out this shot
of his Cinebench score oh wow okay if
you want to see some over price to
cringe well I don't even care about the
fact that he's throwing in two monitors
that's just an excuse to raise the price
you're buying the PC not the display you
can get the display anywhere for pretty
cheap look at how cringe-worthy that
cable management is that 24 pin is just
like he completely ignored the cable
shroud there that Nunes exp through into
the s 340 that is so painful he's got an
FX
4350 in there so that's already outdated
and an NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti Lisa got the
four gig variant it was originally
asking four thousand dollars for this
setup right here and even including a
monitor I don't think so
even if he is it ain't worth 4 grand
it's not even worth 2,000 he literally
cut the price in half for you folks you
know you're getting a good deal now was
this i7 4790k GTX 970 16 gigs of ram
even got a creative soundblaster Z
studio-quality High Definition sound
card installed comes with the tactile
audio hub desk control unit check out
his awesome monitor stand that is what I
call innovation right there folks he's
using it looks like textbooks no it's
got the Mockingjay the Mockingjay is
definitely a part of that Wow how much
do you want for this $1,200 it's a 6700
k92 yeah that's actually not a bad price
for that combo it's also including
peripherals and a gaming monitor this
one's not bad here's one that'll make
you a puke look at the cable management
inside that beast this dude took all of
three seconds to make this look
beautiful on the inside what's even
worse is he decided to buy a windowed
case like if you know that your cable
management's gonna be trashed do
everyone else a favor in your house and
cover that stuff up he's got an i-5 5400
K six gigabyte gtx 970 and for the whole
shebang the
once eighteen hundred dollars in st.
Augustine and I don't really think so ok
so just take one look at this one right
here one look at this setup 3 grand
alright now you might be thinking
yourself oh well he's including the
whole setup right monitors keyboard
peripherals the computer tower look he
says right here parts not included
keyboard mouse or monitors so literally
you're just paying for whatever the heck
is in this PC right here you're paying
three grand for that folks an i7 7700 K
okay three hundred three hundred and
we'll give him the benefit of the doubt
three fifty asus strix see two hundred a
let's say three hundred 650 let's get a
960 Evo and the 850 Evo and a gtx 980ti
and that looks like it for the really
expensive parts of this build
still doesn't come close to three grand
sorry dude that's the dope is six
monitors setup I've ever seen I mean the
pricing too bad considering what he's
got in there's an i7 an old i7 but it's
still decent 550 ti it'll run some basic
games in 1080p but he's got six of these
monitors he's like just take them all I
don't even want them okay rule number
one when it comes to Craigslist make
your photos at least look presentable
like you're trying to sell whatever
you're trying to sell to random people
that live around you based on pictures
and your word and your text so most
people if they're smart arca just gonna
take your word for they're gonna look at
the picture that's what they're gonna
use to verify what you're saying and if
your first picture is just a bunch of
cables sprawled behind three monitors on
the floor and you're not even showing
the PC in the first picture you got a
problem and then when you finally do see
the PC you see that the cable management
was pure trash and his specs are just
not all that inviting for a $1,300
asking price this dude's calling this PC
very upgradable for future developments
right but he's got a freaking H 110
motherboard in there so that's not
overclock well so even if you want to
upgrade the i3 6100 you got in there
you're not gonna be able to overclock it
assuming you go for the biggest and best
I 5 and i7 in this class and everything
else in that for the most part is just
bare-bones he's got a hard drive eight
gigs of RAM
what a four gig ddr5 1050 TI yeah that's
okay you got to upgrade everything in
the system
oh my gaming PC 750 dollars I don't care
what the specs are in this system I'm
not paying $750 for this frickin rat's
nest he's got a G 32:58 overclocked to 4
gigahertz two gtx 950 to 600 watt power
supply a wireless network card and 180
gig P&amp;amp;Y SSD windows not included so yeah
the OS is on you this has got to be one
of the ugliest PC builds I've ever seen
what is it with people wanting all of
their money back with these pcs like
they don't think they'd appreciate it
all he's even got the price listed out
here on PC poor picker it cost him
sixteen hundred and eighteen dollars I
don't think he has oh he does have
Windows 10 included in that he's got
Windows 10 Pro and he's wanting more
than he paid to build the pcs charging
you about $190 to assemble this PC you
could watch any of the tech tuber
channels on YouTube and in 15 minutes
figure out how to build a PC like this
one you didn't even bother cutting down
the tubes to sighs these guys reservoir
on the outside of this case Wow dude
there is so much room in the H 440 why
did you put the reservoir outside and
then just look so trashy I am sorry but
that just looks so bad what on earth did
he do oh yeah you know its mediately
worth $2,300 when the title clearly says
he has a single gtx 1070 in there so we
got a core i7 4790k 16 gigs of ram 1071
terabyte hard drive and an SSD
motherboard MSI z97 very high
performance can handle most if not all
games I need money for college will only
sell with bundle so PC keyboard and
Ultra HD 4k monitor sorry bud but even
with that Ultra HD 4k monitor yet there
this PC with this trashy cable
management is not worth $2,300 come on
here goes the pet peeve again VR ready
custom water-cooled gaming PC there is
nothing custom about this water
set up here he literally has to a iOS
one for his graphics card and one for
his CPU there was no custom aspect to
this build at all FX 8320 you
automatically know this is worth thirty
seven hundred and fifty dollars when
he's got an FX 8320 in there 16 gigs of
ram I don't even care at this point the
graphics cards a 1080 founders edition
that's cooled by it looks like a 120 mil
a i/o $3,750 he said he's mark this up
three times grand I don't even need to
look at the specs there's no way this is
worth two grand
oh no he has an i7 59 60 X in here what
you got like blocks X 99 X 6 gaming PC
I'm assuming that's the motherboard 16
gigs of ram and it she tips 960 you put
a gtx 960 into the same pc as a $1600
CPU when it was brand new high-end 8
core gaming system I'm sorry but the gtx
960 is not high-end I don't care what
CPU you have in there excellent
condition used for only three weeks I'm
gonna take a chance here and say that
that's not true hey we got another one
asking for grand he's saying that his
z170 ex gaming G one gigabyte
motherboard was four hundred and sixty
dollars plus he's including a $70
two-year replacement plan that is
outrageous that motherboard is worth
half that price high seven sixty seven
hundred K 32 gigs of ram sli EVGA gtx
980ti 's nope we're still not near four
grand Sound Blaster
come on $120 for a sound card ocz
fatality one thousand watt gold power
supply two hundred and fifty five
dollars and he's including the price of
Windows 10 at $90
chasity not not chassis chasity
something tells me that this dude is
just pulling numbers out of thin air
let's see here's one from my home town
he's gonna I buy power for $850
top-of-the-line gaming PC i7 3930k and
an R 9 380 GPU oh yeah folks we know
this is definitely top of the line it
says it's worth over $1,500 but it is
really worth over 2
thousand dollars and it doesn't list the
price of the motherboard which cost over
three hundred and fifty dollars and with
the same card costing over 250 and a few
other little small parts he is a
Salesman through and through this guy's
asking $1,200 for a Cuba PC it doesn't
look all that infighting on the inside
here two gtx 960 s and sli it's an odd
choice in FX 8350 and he wants $1,200
for it this person didn't even list the
cpu in his system he's got a gtx 960
okay it's mediocre and 16 gigs of ram
and he wants $1,000 for it was that it's
a g1 sniper b6 so what that's a be 150
motherboard so he's probably either got
a locked eye five or an i3 in there
either way it didn't come out to a
thousand dollars just another example of
someone wanting all of their money back
on a PC they built two or three years
ago let's see and the last one of the
day custom-built gaming PC $1000 here
graphics card has over a terabyte it
doesn't even list the graphics card why
did he write here no that's storage what
so we're just supposed to guess what
that is
but probably a 970 or 980 I don't know
for $1000 it better be 980 I'm assuming
this is either an FX 6300 or an FX 4350
because he's only paired it with a 970
Pro usually over the a core variant or
the hypothetical a Corvair and I have a
video discussing that right here the
difference between a true a core CPU and
an FX 8 core CPU usually those would go
into the 990 FX series boards so 970 Pro
assume it's the lower end chips why he
probably didn't say what it was in the
ad and he wants $1000 for it that that's
ridiculous
well if your faith in humanity was
pretty low before I imagine it's a bit
lower now these craigslist posts are a
bit ridiculous now there are some decent
posts out there some people have really
nice custom loops that they're they're
asking around what they paid for them I
understand that they put a lot of work
into those bends and stuff and if you
you know show up to the person's place
and everything looks nice and it runs
properly then yeah that's probably an
okay investment if you don't want to do
it yourself but for a lot of these like
older pcs three four or five years old
they want their money back that's
essentially what they're asking like hey
give me
money back for this pci bill four years
ago even though you could buy most of
these parts for cheaper on sites like
ebay if you liked this video maybe like
the concept or just appreciate the
savage and its look i'm gonna tell you
if something's a bad deal you're gonna
hear it straight from my face that it's
a bad deal then let me know that you
