shouldn't be doing that have a gander
again it sound
I almost plug this into my iPhone 7 what
a joke right
go get my converter and sounds good
hey what's up everyone just me and my
garage down my Lamborghinis my Ferrari
I'm trying to beat I Lopez I wanted to
show you just a sneak peek of what to
expect with Walter White 2.0 I don't
have a lot of time I've had I've been
slammed with early tests this week and
you know school comes first now I want
to go over the specs very quickly if you
want more detail about the computer you
can check out the card right there but
we are running a 69 hundred k i7 from
Intel let's say effectively thousand
dollar processor looking at eight cores
16 threads overclocked currently to 4.3
gigahertz
at one point three six volts I didn't
really tinker with the voltage very much
I probably could have downed it a little
more but I stable right now and the core
temps aren't reaching 70 degrees Celsius
so I'd call that a success for now on
top of that we have two gtx 1070 from
EVGA and sli painted custom white of
course so right now I am obviously
running the redox mod it's white looks a
little different I think it looks better
in my opinion and yes I am playing
online so if I get banned
you know whatever so be it just start
from scratch again I really only play
gt5 for the sake of benchmarking at this
point I used to play it a lot but I
found that I'm more interested in
first-person shooters now maybe getting
some battlefield one later
so I'll frame rates that's what I wanted
to talk about first what you're looking
at right now is literally a maxed out of
some weird or affecting look at that
look at the grass that's strange that's
likely a result of the modification
that's not a vanilla issue so it's
raining it kind of sucks you can't
really see the cool lighting effects but
in settings we have here graphics at
pretty much max
I mean they are maxed msaa times 8 vsync
I have basing on because I want to look
fluid for you guys but frame weights
will go well over 60 here I'm going to
overclock 275 probably the next video
when I do my benchmarking I will
benchmark an ultra wide 1080p as well as
1440 PM staying away from 4k for now I
want a good 4k monitor before I do that
I don't
upscaler or anything of that sort so
very high all the way through ultra
times 8 anti-aliasing for reflections
and just in general water quality all
the good stuff you can see literally
it's maxed out I have depth of field
effects turned off because that just
looks like garbage in my opinion and
motion blur off because that looks like
garbage in my opinion and everything
else is good to go and an occlusion that
that's max ok so you can see that's
maxed out we're pushing 9 gigabytes of
video memory and then advanced tabs long
shadows on high resolution shadows on
high detail streaming offline on
extended distance scaling on extended
shadow distance on frame scaling mode
now this will kind of sort of simulate a
higher resolution display obviously you
can't change the pixel density or the
pixel dimensions of your monitor but it
will in some cases make things look a
bit more crisp I have an anti-aliasing
on 2 times 8 so I'm not going to bother
touching that because it already looks
beautiful now this is probably as clean
a GTA 5 video as you will find on
YouTube and in 1080p and that is thanks
to Walter white version 2.0 pushing us
well against that 60 FPS boundary so the
this is kind of a sneak peak of what you
should expect a Walter white version 2.0
obviously a very expensive computer and
as a result your your I mean you're
going to get some of the best
performance out there at least in these
resolutions here I think the only thing
that you could probably do better in a
build like this is to swap out the 210
70s with 210 80s and in that case you
could probably get these same frame
rates in 4k versus 1080p ultra wide look
at that detail look at the road my oh my
now something that's interesting my
frame rate has dropped a 45 50 now 55
I think the reflections are really
killing the frame rates they're not now
a lot of this has to do with the fact
that story mode implements more of the
mod than that online mode does so we're
seeing a greater degree of texture
detail different special effects things
of that sort that are in story mode that
aren't in online mode which is why our
frame rate I presume is lower here but
still I'd say for maxing
everything on including advanced
settings around 50 frames per seconds
pretty darn good in ultra wide 1080p
cards getting really hot
Oh what that's about I'm going to keep
villainies I don't know what's happening
here I'll do you a favor this is how
loud I sound but the microphone
you know half a foot for my face
that's loud that's a lot of than in-game
volume by a by a long shot I just
realized something that sound you're
hearing is not coming from the graphics
cards I think that's coming from the
power supply so what's likely happening
is that sixty nine hundred K is just
pulling so much power from the PSU that
those rails are heating up and won't
rail I think it's a single 12 little
rail and it's just getting too hot so
the fan curve is kicking in and it just
sounds like it's just going full blast
Wow Walter White is upset that it
doesn't sound good and I think that
means I'm gonna have to replace my power
supply which sucks but that's not
healthy power supply shouldn't be doing
that
have a gander again at the sound
it's definitely not the gpus because the
GPUs I turned that those fans I turned
off at one point and I can still hear it
it's not that fan I calibrated it's not
that fan I calibrated it you can
actually see the blades turning though
those are probably turning at 800 or 900
rpm it's not the the radiator fans
because those I there's have a distinct
sounds I know it's not coming from from
there the only other fan in the system
is the power supply fan and I assume
that because we have our sixty nine
hundred K overclock and it's being used
fairly significantly in GTA 5 which is
known to do that it's a great utilizar
of both CPU and GPU horsepower I am
assuming that the 69 hundred K is just
pulling a lot of juice I'm expecting
anywhere from 250 to 300 watts maybe
more overclockable Broadwell each chips
are notorious for just straight stealing
juice from the power supply when under
load I expect that's what's going on
here and just the the rail inside the
power supply is getting way too hot well
that is unfortunate I'm glad I found
that out sooner rather than later though
we all kind of found that out at the
same time right we heard that all at the
same time so I think what that means is
I'm not to replace my power supply I
think that's the safest bet this isn't
80 plus gold rated power supply from
deep cool but the gold rating really has
nothing to do with the actual
reliability of the power supply it's
just a an efficiency rating so under X
amount of load your PSU is going to be X
efficient X percentage efficient that's
that's what the 80-plus ratings mean but
it has nothing to do with reliability
and PSU longevity so I guess I'm going
to contact deep cool let them know
what's going on with this particular
unit here ask if that's a normal thing
or not and begin the hunt for another
power supply more money in the drain
this is science studio thanks for
learning with us give me a thumbs up if
you'd feel bad for me feels bad man feel
pretty bad right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
