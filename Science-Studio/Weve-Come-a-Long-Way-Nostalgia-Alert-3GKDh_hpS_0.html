much different I want to dedicate this
video specifically to this channel to
our channel and its growth over the past
12 months this is our channel antha size
that because it wouldn't exist without
you without your views and your support
I would just move on to something else
find some other hobby I created the
channel in the summer of 2015 under the
name science studio and shifted my
content toward the end of that year
towards PCs and that's kind of where
it's been ever since I built my first PC
in order to edit videos properly and I
was hooked you guys know how it is you
build your first PC and it's like I just
want to build more it's exactly how I
was so I said ma I'll just you know
shift the content towards that and let's
see if we can pick up a few subscribers
along the way but Wow
nearly 200,000 in a 12-month period is
insane you guys are so enthusiastic and
so supportive and I do appreciate that I
don't know what else to say I am very
thankful for all of you even the ones
that I argue with even the ones that you
know I have beef with whatever if you
still watch the videos you're still
supporting me in some way and I do thank
you for that so the rest of this video
will be one large throwback I have about
six or seven clips from videos that were
uploaded long long ago they're kind of a
progression so you can see how video
content and quality changed over time as
well as audio as well as what was behind
me the things we talked about I'm gonna
be pretty cool if you want to watch any
of those videos I'll have the cards up
top and also have those videos shown
with their timestamps in the video's
description if interested in watching
any of those I invite you do at least
check out one or two especially if
you're new it just kind of gives you an
idea of where we were and the things we
talked about and maybe it'll bring up
some suggestions for future videos here
on the channel I do hope you enjoy happy
2017 folks I'll see you in the next
video
you processor and with this high protein
for we should be able to push out around
four point four or four point five
gigahertz safely without having to up
the voltage too much and without pushing
our temp limits okay so this is the box
that all of your mounting pins and
screws would come in we're not going to
need this from what I've heard because
our board is an AMD 3 plus board and
three plus we won't have music because
the cooler itself automatically comes
fit with that
it's basically been sitting in a box for
a long time is tear it down and we're
going to see what was inside of this
very old but very cool first gen Sony
Playstation there's something in here
that like rattles I have no idea what
that is so maybe we'll find out when we
actually start tearing it down
CEO Jensen Wong received quite a lot of
flack for showcasing the drive px to
board on stage which is supposed to
feature two Tegra chips and two Pascal
GPUs however the board he held in his
hand was fitted with makeshift Maxwell
based chips likely from the GTX 980 look
familiar so what does this mean
Nvidia might be a bit behind but they
swear by a 2016 release date and
computer enthusiasts couldn't be more
anxious for starters Pascal will utilize
a 60 nanometers platform comparable to
Polaris's 14 nanometer and will feature
support for DirectX 12 we can limit this
exact phenomena via a camera by tiny
exposure specifically to win the next
spoke of each rim or the next blade of
each rotor moves into the same position
that the previous spoke or blade was the
frame before so if camera see it this
way and the human eye sees it this way
can we still say that the humanized
perception of reality is entirely
separate from that of a cameras food for
thought
what is real piece Wow okay very small
competing build you build your computer
in this Greg if you need like me to buy
you a hamster to put in this tiny cage
like anything I will buy you a hamster
actually need one of these I want to
start playing racing games how much are
they so it's only do these are actually
kind of cheap I don't especially Alex we
don't know off filming enough still
awesome so we already got all of our oh
yeah sorry okay I'm at Best Buy I'm
about to buy two Apple products I've
never done this before I mean really
this laptop is so thin when I do it like
when I move it to here the camera thinks
I'm trying to trying to focus on stuff
behind it I can't even get it to be
detected by the center auto focus here
and then the Apple watch that's just
something that I kind of just picked up
on the spot I said well I'm going Apple
here in here so I might as well just get
the full package I am awake
say my name Heisenberg you're goddamn
right
I don't think I forgot anything if you'd
like to see maybe a benchmark of a
single 1072 5820k versus a 6700 K in the
same graphics card just for comparisons
sake let me know if you'd like to see
something like that in the comments
below give this one a thumbs up if you
thought the build was cool to that build
suck to give it a dislike be sure to
click Subscribe but if you haven't
already stay tuned for an official
review finally of the deep cool genome
this is a revised version that also
comes with the PCIe riser card which
means that you can Oriya graphics card
this this way you get my point
this is salable studio thanks for
learning with us
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
