reviewed it and dedicated video you can
check it out of the card up there this
is the big shirt and three you can see
it's a slightly beefier version both of
these models have five copper heat pipes
although these are nickel-plated and
apart from that there isn't much of a
difference
the fans are slightly different we'll
talk about that and the temperature
differences are noticeable
there's nothing substantial going on
with big shirt and three of the big
shirt and two didn't already have going
forward they're both small compact
cooler so they're not going to perform
as well as say a hyper 212 Evo but for
the price and considering the form
factor applications I think these are
decent coolers and right now you can
really only buy the big shuriken three
of the shuriken two is pretty old and
kind of phased out because there's no am
for support with that cooler big
shuriken 3includes am for support and
it's pretty much the same size again
we'll talk about all that in this video
stay tuned Thermal Grizzlies carbonate
pads offer peace of mind
ease of installation and industry
standard performance in a market crowded
with mediocre thermal compounds our own
testing confirms that they conduct heat
appropriately and provide a safe and
consistent membrane between the dire IHS
and cooler best of all you can grab them
in several sizes and reuse them as many
times as you'd like
Carbonite pads are a peace of mind in my
book and they're very consistent and
that's why I use them for CPU testing
check them out and via the link below so
maybe something I don't typically do
with reviews of this caliber and I'm
gonna mention the price of this cooler
first big shuriken three comes in at
around 40 to 50 USD somewhere in the
middle currently on Newegg I've linked
it down below if I have the amazon link
or something similar to this I will link
that down below as well so check it out
if you're interested in this form factor
other than that though aesthetically you
can see it has a nice black frame that
wraps all the way around the heatsink
and the I don't really know how I feel
about this and the nickel plated copper
pipes look okay I actually prefer the
bare copper piping I think it's just a
nice contrast to the aluminum in stacked
but I mean it's not a big deal in terms
of sheer weight to the picture in three
definitely weighs more and that is proud
to testament to this coolers ability to
absorb a bit more
and we do noticeably have more surface
area that these fins are covering
because they are longer and they are as
of dense I actually didn't check density
before and say yeah the fin density is
about the same but the fin depth as in
how far the fins reach down into the
cooler definitely close to doubled with
the big shirt in three so I expect a
better cooling performance I mean that's
just the bigger the cooler typically the
more heat it can handle as for the two
fans you get with these coolers this is
the big shuriken to span you can see
it's very very slim 120ml form factor
it's a four pin pwm fan this is the big
shuriken threes fan it is also a pwm fan
but this one has rubber vibration mounts
on both the front and back sides of this
fan you also have a dark gray tone this
time around versus the straight black so
it could look better or worse depending
on the color scheme of your build and
the one big catch the one perhaps
negative especially when seen in the
context of this form factor is this fans
thickness if I hold up the big shuriken
to span you can see it is noticeably
thinner I would say almost maybe half a
centimeters and maybe will over half a
centimeter thicker than the big shuriken
choose and that doesn't sound like a lot
I heard why are you being super picky
well because the big sure can to barely
fit in some of my favorite ITX cases
including the frackle design note 202
with this fan on the big shirt in three
it won't fit so I've got a fragile note
or two here this is actually one the
previous builds have showcased on the
channel check it out in the card up
there I have both coolers as well and
I'm just gonna I'm just gonna set them
on top you can see the cooler barely
clears the frame and that's why this
cooler is like perfect for the note 202
in fact we can keep the dust filter of
the no 202 in this case and the frame
itself will actually sit against the
fans frame but it won't interfere with
the rotation of the fins at all so it's
again a perfect fit now in the case of
the big sure again three I get nice and
low and you can see that the fan frame
clearly extends past the height of the
chassis and even when we remove the dust
filter in the no 202 we there's no way
to secure this right so a solution if
you want to call it that is to swap this
fan
for the big shuriken to fan now it is an
extremely tight fit in fact the big
shuriken 3 without the fans is still
slightly taller than the shuriken 2 but
if you swap the thicker fan for the
shuriken to fan you can make it almost
work again you have to remove the dust
filter and it's gonna press right
against that it might even flex just
slightly but it's better than having no
support at all so it is a shame that you
have to do this to get it to work you
have to modify not just the cooler but
also the case you have to remove the
dust filter that's a shame
but it's it's possible I will say that
it's possible so this is the big
shuriken 3 cooler with the shuriken 2
fan installed I'm going to actually not
installed it's just kind of resting on
top of it and no issues you can screw
this in no problem and this is without
the cooler secured so that will lower it
just slightly but enough to where you
won't have any issues with the fans fins
scraping against the chassis so yeah
that's a bit of supporting I mean you
hold these two coolers side-by-side and
in terms of height they look to be about
the same size knew that going with a fan
like this was going to improve their new
cooler in two regards first off the
cooling potential the cooling
performance of the cooler in question
was going to improve because of this fan
can displace more air perf in this fan
from the big shuriken to has many more
fins because the fins themselves can't
be angled sharp enough to this place to
same amount of air per fin so you have
to compensate by adding more fins that
increases the sound of the tone actually
the tone itself is a bit higher pitch
than this one this is a lower pitched
sound which I think is a bit harder for
the human ear to pick up and so yeah it
was a big trade-off basically the cooler
is definitely quieter the big shuriken 3
is and the cooler is definitely a better
performing cooler in terms of
temperatures but you eliminate
compatibility with some very important
cases and I think that's a missed
opportunity now let's talk about ease of
installation big shuriken 2 has a fairly
easy install process you have two
brackets one on each side of the cold
plate you can see we have four mounting
points here
typical Intel form factors are supported
here and then you have a basically a
bracket at retention plate on the
backside that will hold this cooler
again
the motherboard against the CPU and
there are just four screws to secure so
really how you want to do this is put
the cooler face down flip your
motherboard upside down smoosh it
against the cooler and then screw in the
four points from the back of the
motherboard and that's literally all you
have to do so secure the brackets flip
it over screw it in from the back there
you go the picture again three is
actually a bit more difficult to install
in my opinion but part of the reason why
that's the case is because you now have
an for support and when you add support
for both AMD and Intel under the same
cooler and I'm sure manufacturers are
aware of this I've seen many coolers
that have to kind of accommodate in
unique ways you have to do some
interesting things and make the process
just a bit harder for the average
builder to get this to work across
multiple platforms I did a decent job
considering you do have these two
pre-installed screws that sit across
this little retention plate on top of
the cold plate and you screw these two
into a bracket that you secure from the
back of the motherboard the bracket
itself includes a couple more steps
because you do have to first off secure
that to the motherboard before you mount
the cooler itself but overall I'd say
the install process though it is a bit
longer is just as simple as the big
shuriken choose and of course including
a m4 support now is a huge plus now
let's talk temps you can see four
coolers here obviously the picture in
three and two are included but also the
be quiet dark rock slim and the cooler
master hyper 212 black edition with
average temps in blue and max temps in
orange you can see that the hybrid 212
Evo squeaked out a win over the be quiet
dark rock slim just a 1 degree Celsius
Delta there 73 ver 74 average temps were
pretty much the same
by the way average temps really aren't
saying much for us here although it is
more or less a baseline to indicate that
there was nothing obscure about the way
I was testing so it's more or less a
check for me I wouldn't focus too much
on those max temps though for the big
shuriken 3 reached 77 degrees Celsius
about a three degrees bump over the dark
rock slim and then the big shuriken 2
reached a pretty toasty 81 degrees
Celsius for the exact same rig now I
want to encourage you not to compare
these results with previous results I've
posted on the channel regarding the dark
rock slim and the 212 black edition I
have a totally different setup here for
these so it's the exact same components
but the
our clocks are different the voltages
are different and I had to do that
because these smaller coolers here
couldn't handle the manual over clocks
that we were originally push eight next
that we have perceived sound intensity
obviously measured in decibels we have a
sound meter now so our results for the
top two coolers are gonna be slightly
different than what you've seen in
previous videos the dark rock slim I
wrote at thirty five point two decibels
at 40 point one decibels under load
forty two point three for the hyper 212
black edition only slightly louder for
the big shuriken three forty three point
two and forty four even for the big
shuriken two
so taking into account solely the price
and the performance metrics you just saw
I'd say the big shirt in three is a
worthy upgrade in fact they're not
really charging much more at all for a
substantially better cooler in my
opinion but the big issue that we have
to come back to again is compatibility
because this cooler is noticeably taller
and that will restrict the use case of
this cooler especially in smaller form
factor builds involving cases like the
fractal node 202 I'll say it again just
for emphasis because a lot of you are
asking about that so if you're willing
to modify it just a little bit maybe use
an even slimmer fan like the one that's
included in the big shirt and to then by
all means the big shuriken 3 is a great
cooler for those lower profile builds
but if I you know if I was building like
a micro ATX or a full-size ATX build
then the big shirt in 3 obviously
wouldn't be my first choice
the the hyper 212 Black Edition and the
dark rock slim which there are up some
is more expensive the hyper 212 is is
fairly cheap actually around 30 or 40
bucks
so cheaper than big shuriken 3 is a
better cooler overall it's it keeps
temps lower and it also runs quieter and
in my opinion it looks pretty sweet at
the same time especially the Black
Edition so if you're building a standard
size PC it makes no sense in my pan to
go with a big shuriken 3 and less for
whatever reason you like those top flow
coolers but there are better top flow
coolers out there instead the only
viable use case I see for the big shirt
and 3 is again in the low profile builds
and when you make it taller and reduce
compatibility you're kind of
counteracting the only competitive
advantage you have in this space so I
really wish scythe had lowered the
height of this to where it fit you know
into the same cases that big shuriken 2
did because right now it's about a
centimeter to a tall and there's really
not much more you can do to modify the
cases in question to make this fit so
it's unfortunate but I I can say with
certainty this is a better cooler for
the price so it's kind of a mixed bag
and the conclusion is kind of it's kind
of weird for me to draw because I really
like it but can you actually use it in
your build it ultimately comes down to
the case you choose the form factor and
set it up but let me know what you think
