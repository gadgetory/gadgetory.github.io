know right but guess what there's
nothing you can really do with it yet
that's right you're shiny and dust free
computer is about as useless as a brick
without an operating system cue Windows
10 now I know it isn't perfect people
complain about it all the time but it's
mainstream a lot of people use it or an
older version of it but boy oh boy is it
responsive if you haven't seen my latest
build video I invite you to check it out
before watching this one because in it I
performed actually only about half the
steps needed to have a fully functioning
PC so the hardware is half of it and
then installing the software to allow
your hardware to communicate with you is
the second half so I have yet to load
Windows 10 on this machine and that's
what we're gonna do in this video but
we're not gonna pay a hundred plus USD
for it not a chance this is what happens
when you have next to no competition GG
Microsoft so in response to this a
company by the name of s CD he reached
out now I've seen them advertising on
other tech channels you know Windows 10
Pro for under 20 bucks but I always kind
of had my doubts and reservations
there's got to be a catch right how can
a key for software this expensive be so
cheap so what I told sgdq is this let me
put it to the test if it works for me
and I see it with my own eyes then I'll
publish this video but I'm on my
troubleshooting and my personal install
in the video is proof for my audience
and frankly to my surprise they said
sure sounds good
now full disclosure upfront SCB key is
paying me for this video but nonetheless
at this video is published on the
channel it means that yeah the key work
because obvious I'm not gonna publish
the video and take money from them if
you know that's not gonna work I'm not
gonna promote a product that doesn't
work so let's at least see how easy this
is to do saying is though you already
know that the key is gonna work first
and foremost navigate to SCV key com
it's the very top link in this video
description if you have trouble finding
the Windows 10 Pro link to their site
you can click the suggested tab in
Google search from here create an
account select your payment method I use
PayPal if you're concerned at all about
plastering your credit card number
everywhere then PayPal is probably your
safest bet and then record your Windows
10 Pro key after purchasing you can see
mine right here and don't bother testing
it I enter this key long before you're
watching this video so nice try next you
gotta have a boot drive this is
typically a USB stick loaded with the
windows 10 media creation tool you can
download the tool via the link below
it's just under the icd key website once
you flash the drive plug it into your
current paperweight
that's the PC without an OS and boot
into the tool via the boot menu this is
where you'll want to enter the Windows
10 Pro activation key you purchase from
s CD key I'll go ahead and enter mine
now you can see it on my phone I took a
picture of it and there we go now it
seems as though everything's running
fine but we're not gonna actually know
if Windows is activated until we boot
into the operating system for the first
time so let's install Windows and then
check the activation status once we're
booted in you can navigate to the
Settings tab under the Start menu select
updates and security select activation
on the Left menu and we can confirm that
Windows 10 Pro is officially activated
so you see no gimmicks here I mentioned
this will really come in handy for those
building new PCs or on older generations
of Windows looking for the added perks
and support with Windows 10 DirectX 12
is like the first thing that comes to
mind especially since Microsoft
abandoned its initial free update from
Windows 7 but if you're worried about
security measures and the like because
Windows 10 just isn't you know the most
secure and lockdown OS out there
you can find other OS keys on the site
to ensure the full access to your
software and by the way this activation
method works whether you've got a fresh
OS install for a new PC build or not so
in other words if you've been sporting
like the Windows 10 needs to be
activated watermarks
several months these keys from SCD key
will immediately activate and remove
those restrictions and annoyances so
that's it for this one again pretty
straightforward I'm gonna use sed key
from now on actually for all my PC
builds for Windows 10 Pro I might
actually link it permanently in the
video description because I'm really
impressed with how cheap Windows 10 Pro
activation keys are from this site and
as far as I'm concerned they're very
reputable if it works for me guy saw it
in the video this is a site that I do
condone I don't know where they get the
keys from but they work and that's
really all the consumer needs to worry
about you saw I purchased this like any
other consumer out there I was nobody
special to them when I bought this key
and it worked like a charm and it worked
for you as well I recommend going
through a reputable vendor like SC D key
you can find a link down below 10% off
your purchase by the way look you could
try a site like eBay maybe pay a little
less but you're buying from somebody you
don't know and the key might just be a
temporary activation key I've been there
done that it's a pain after three months
you get the activation little watermark
at the bottom and it's just I just hate
dealing with stuff like that I just want
a simple activation key and I'll never
have to worry about it again and that's
what this offers you so again check the
link down below if you guys liked the
video let me know give this one a thumbs
up I appreciate it thumbs down for the
opposite click subscribe but if you
haven't already in stay tuned for more
content like this
this is science studio thanks for
learning with us
