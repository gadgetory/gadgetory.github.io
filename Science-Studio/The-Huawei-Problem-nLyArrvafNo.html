finally penetrates us markets get
excited regardless of nationality it
creates traditional competition it
bolsters innovation imagine if we only
had one smartphone supplier say what if
Apple had no competition what if Samsung
and LG didn't exist would we have the
iPhone 10 s and 10 our smart phones
we've come to love and hate today my
point is on the surface when huawei
sells products in the United States it
appears like a good thing but dig a
little deeper and you'll find that
things aren't as black and white as they
seem
hence the tinfoil hat you're looking for
a database of PC builds with pictures
spec sheets and all look no further than
build dot G G with its intuitive search
engine you can find computer builds
based on form factor color location
brand and other prominent themes my two
favorite toggles are the cooling and RGB
menus you're looking for a custom cooled
rig for example just click this one
right here and here's a ton of builds
from which to draw inspiration and if
you're looking for builds without RGB
LEDs maybe none at all or just a single
color you can filter that way as well
just a few examples to show you how
intuitive this thing really is sign up
for builds at GG today for $0.00 that's
because it's free and start sharing
today so jump back to early 2018 in
February heads of the NSA CIA FBI the
list goes on tons of important US
bureaus go on the record urging
government employees to avoid Huawei
cell phones why because the company has
close ties to the Chinese government
Huawei is Chinese after all but ever
since the u.s. entered this cold war of
sorts with China US officials have been
concerned about the security and
integrity of products influenced
directly by the Chinese government there
were talks of wiretapping location
tracking and intellectual property theft
does this make more sense now and that
was only the beginning politics aside
one of the big reasons why we're
currently in a trade war with China
according to our own government is
because of intellectual property theft
and regardless of whether you agree with
the tactics being used or not China
doesn't have the cleanest track record
when it comes to honoring international
patents or licenses companies have been
known to steal design cues from Apple
Samsung implement unlicensed features
and even disingenuously promote products
on review sites like Best Buy why what
was actually caught in a controversy
amid a Facebook post urging folks to
leave reviews touting the unreleased
mate ten pros impressive features
without having any actual hands-on
experience with the product that's the
whole point of reviews to leave your
hands on feedback right so this was
strictly against best biased Terms of
Service and once consumers caught onto
the ploy they were displeased to say the
least but it gets the point across right
not to be clear these issues don't
pertain solely to Chinese companies I
think every company to an extent it has
to deal with something like this but
they do seem disproportionately
concentrated in China so the u.s. is
fighting back I'll be it in a very
controversial way and back to the design
keys we mentioned a second ago how about
this make book X Pro I reviewed it
actually against the 13-inch MacBook Pro
in this video right here a few months
ago
it looks oddly similar but does
outperform its Apple counterpart in
several categories this laptop has a
beautiful touch screen a better keyboard
in my opinion and a significantly better
graphics processor discreet graphics the
MX 150 in this case is very impressive
even in its 10 watt form and especially
when compared to the ia GPS of most
ultra books including the MacBook lend
you the main book crushes Adobe Premiere
renders an even lighter 1080p and 720p
gaming I could run pub G fortnight
rocket League the list goes on I
definitely wouldn't promote the laptop
as a gaming device but it'll do it under
dire circumstances if needed so for me
personally the maple X Pro has been my
portable video editing machine it worked
beautifully for CES this year check out
our coverage here and I plan to take it
again with me to copy text in Taiwan
battery life is great the trackpad is
well it's no MacBook trackpad but I'll
trade it for this USB 3 port any day of
the week that's how much I value sb3 now
you see this is all one big trade-off
right MacBooks patented trackpad
technology for example is technically
protected and it can arguably limit
innovation to an extent but where it
truly counts at least in my eyes
the MacBook X pro serves its purpose so
why so much hate then over a brand that
makes great products like the MacBook X
Pro well that's the optics first off
this laptop looks almost identical looks
like a knockoff MacBook Pro and there's
really no denying that second it's
really how it appears in the news in our
own government and online right it's how
its presented by other people not just
Huawei did you know that Huawei is being
sued by the United States twice actually
one involves theft and the other
involves fraud which is basically that
and these kinds of stories can
absolutely ruin a company's reputation
in a particular market but it doesn't
mean the company will magically
disappear how about this one did you
know that Huawei is the world's second
largest smartphone brand they don't have
the most popular phones but by sales
volume technically speaking they're
second only to Samsung you wouldn't know
that because Huawei really hasn't done a
great job penetrating US markets the
mobile side they haven't really scored a
major carrier with any of their latest
smartphones either few exceptions but
you get the point people just don't want
to touch Huawei products because of the
optics so companies this large attract a
great deal of attention including from
their own governments and that's what
concerns the United States this is China
we're talking about and trying to not
known for upholding individual privacy
rights in the recent past I mean maybe
the Chinese are listening to this
conversation I'm having with you guys
right now and a lot of tops right over
there does it sound that far-fetched in
2019 and that's exactly what Huawei ZT
and others have had to come back in 2019
whether it's happening or not that is
what it might appear to be on the
surface it's the optics here in the
States it's how things appear to the
average consumer anyone willing to do an
ounce of research in the company knows
that Huawei has a shady past that's not
to say that their companies don't but
when your country's own government
encourages employees to avoid hallways
smart phones like the plague you've got
to step back and rethink a thing or two
maybe put on the tinfoil hat so what do
you guys think does it sound as though
I'm wearing a tinfoil hat honestly I
couldn't tell you how concerned I was
over using the maple X Pro on a daily
basis I think the approach I take to it
is this I don't know and I don't want to
know same goes for our own government
and that's not to say that we do this
any worse or better than China but I'm
well aware of how intrusive our own
government
be and has been in the past I'm sure
they know more about me than my own
parents do let's leave it at that so
even if you choose to forego huawei
products in favor of say Apple or
Samsung phones your government is still
probably listening that's just how it is
okay time to take off the Hat
now I'm vulnerable what do you guys
think about this I want to open this up
to you guys in the comments section I
want this to be one big discussion I'm
sure we'll have both sides of the
argument so maybe several facets of this
argument reach the comments section I
will be sure to jump in as well from
time to time let me know if you like
somebody my give this one a thumbs up I
appreciate it thumbs up for the office
feeling ever you hate everything my life
click that red subscribe button if you
haven't already I'll catch you in the
next video this is science studio thanks
for wearing tin foil hats with us
actually that's a pretty snug fit now
I'm getting notifications
maybe it's the government nope we're in
the clear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
