this video includes a with a MV section
it's um because I'm being paid by MD
that's not the case at all this videos
not even sponsored it's because I plan
on releasing a similar video sculpted
around Intel in the near future just a
little disclaimer there because well the
comment section anyway so the red team's
definitely been behind and it might not
appear that way to the average consumer
right Ryan's been putting a huge dent
into Intel's grasp the consumer market
prices are extremely competitive
motherboards are cheap and we have
mainstream eight core CPUs on both sides
due in large part to AMD 7-series
endeavors I'm talking about 1700 the
2700 those CPUs but elsewhere in the
industry AMD still has quite the ground
to make up and that's probably an
understatement according to the register
AMD server market share only recently
touched 1% hasn't been anywhere close to
that the past 5 or so years and tells
goals to keep it below 10 percent much
epic fully saturates so again AMD's got
quite a ways to go and don't get me
started on the graphics card side of
things the Radeon division struggle to
offer anything viable following in
videos Pascal launched and I'm using
that as a standard because Turing
honestly out priced much of its
potential audience Vegas 64 and 56 were
overhyped undersupplied extremely
expensive thanks to the mining craze and
soon you can find one there much cheaper
now but we still have nothing viable on
the red team to solely compete with a
1080 TI ignoring Turing for now again
which is overpriced in its own right by
the way this isn't me harping on AMD
that's not the point of this video I
want healthy competition and AMD bring
set to the doorsteps of both Intel and
NVIDIA but the competition could still
be better they aren't forcing either
competitor to rapidly innovate again
ignoring touring whose technology hasn't
fully manifested and likely won't for
several years that's a totally different
topic I have videos on that subject and
that's what AMD has been seeking to
change a little bit of it was
highlighted in today's event firstly AMD
recapped it's epic advancements
particularly its cloud computing and
data center specialties hyping the
world's first seven nanometer data
center CPU epic now dubbed Rome with
Rome architecture will bring advanced
security features and a heavily boosted
IPC figure fabrication will be handled
by
smc we already knew that and the
architecture is expected to have a lower
power draw overall thanks to much
smaller transistors that consume
significantly less power double core
density and improve pipeline the list
goes on the CPS actually incorporate
multiple dyes per se all of which are
tied together with an improved infinity
fabric keep in mind that these are
server CPUs though that we're talking
about this is our first foot indoor if
you will though about 790 meter
architecture so the stuff looks
promising but of course it's supposed to
look promising at these events the point
is to build hype after all so as always
take everything here with a grain of
salt especially when it comes to
extrapolating these announcements into
consumer grade seven nanometer launches
which we expect will roll out around mid
2019 for now we've got a great 12
nanometer platform to deal with and it's
still difficult to recommend lower end
Intel equivalents to be completely
honest here because the value is so
strong on the red team especially with
the lower end chips in general what I
preach is if you want the best for
gaming undeniably intelligible but if
you're more concerned with your budget
or plan to run multiple programs
simultaneously AMD is probably the
better way to go and I think that's a
fair representation I'm not trying to
appease either side here I just think
that it's accurate from the senses the
two companies a consumer perspective
right at this point in time have to
compete they have to have competitive
advantages and I think those are the
advantages at least from the consumers
perspective when it comes to both Intel
and AMD and again we didn't see a huge
IPC jump with second gen rise in
architecture but we did see memory
support and X and P improvements Teddy
your voltage tolerances and higher
frequencies across the board things get
very stubborn past roughly 4.2 gigahertz
and that's something we hope will change
with Zen to the real Zen too but for now
you can get a solid 4 or 6 core
multi-threaded CPU from AMD for well
under 200 bucks that's something Intel
can not say and it's why so many
consumers are wholly backing them as for
my take the r5 2600 in particular
remains the best CPU you can buy for
about a hundred and sixty US dollars
that's an insane deal put it this way if
your computer budget revolves around
$1000 or less the 2600 is the CPU for
you period the one caveat being if you
only game at which point I would
recommend and lock died seven or an
unlocked at five but for AMD you could
pair it with a $100 B 450 motherboard
$150 a basket of ddr4 $50 PSU $50 case
hundred bucks and storage drives and
you've still got roughly $400 for a
killer graphics card again all within
that thousand dollar budget and that's
gonna give you something around a gtx
1080 or a 1070 depending on whether or
not you choose to buy used or new i
built a system just like this right here
the graphics chart i chose with a gtx
1080 which I actually bought used and if
you buy used you might be able to fit
two of these in SLI or throw in a single
gtx 980ti
or an RTX 20 70 maybe if you're lucky
maybe you wait till Black Friday Cyber
Monday you see some great deals in the
are TX cards don't expect it and it's
gonna be very difficult to fit any of
the touring cards at this point into a
thousand dollar budget you might be able
to pull it off if you do let me know and
let me know how you did it but you'd
probably have to make some compromises
but let's assume you want the GTX 1080
like I did here you'll have a killer
system ready for 1080p 1440p and even
lighter 4k gaming you'll have a CPU
capable of driving higher refresh rates
even with the stock cooler and used and
a GPU capable of handling some crispy
in-game settings which of course matters
when you start bumping your resolutions
you don't want to see all those jaggies
thanks to the extra pixels on your
screen especially if the screen is large
I've got benchmarks of this exact config
by the way on the channel you can check
them out via the link below or the card
up top but if you had any doubt about
the viability of this combination just
check out this GTA 5 benchmark the game
is beautifully leveraged both the CPU
and GPU work here and we're able to
sustain 100 FPS in 1440p with high
settings across the board and a dose of
anti-aliasing to boot so if you'd like
to build a system similar to this one
you can check out the links below and
support us in the process we do
appreciate it I wanna know what you guys
think about my CPU of choice for AMD and
the graphics thread chose to pair it
with a lot of people are asking me
whether or not an r5 2600 will
bottleneck a gtx 1080 or an r TX 2080
and the answer to that is under most
circumstances no it will not if you want
your CPU usage most games are gonna be
anywhere between 2 to 4 thread dependent
meaning that your CPU is just it's not
going to be at fault there's not much it
can do because you don't have the
ability to overclock it much
more if you want to call that bottleneck
sure fine but I'd take that any day of
the week over a lock I five for the same
price especially if I'm streaming in the
process that's again just my take I
don't expect everyone to agree with me
there but I wanted to close this with a
bit of an opinion because this is
basically opinionated apart from the
facts I presented earlier in the video
nobody think about my build if you want
again dealt with similar check out the
links below leave a like if you'd like
this video that that'd be cool
you wanted to do that dislike it feel
