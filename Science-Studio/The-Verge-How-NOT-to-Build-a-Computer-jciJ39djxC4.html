forefront on Twitter and I can't resist
it is so bad and full of such
misinformation this may be how the verge
builds a computer but it is not how you
should build one this video is brought
to you by expressvpn now what does a VPN
and why should you care Virtual Private
networking gives you the ability to
securely browse the web by masking your
IP and encrypting your data you can even
run expressvpn from your iPhone or
Android device to retain your security
on-the-go a personal case where this
came in handy
Germany restrict certain Netflix shows
and radio stations like Pandora which I
didn't know beforehand so by simply
clicking this button right here and
tunneling through say Chicago I'm now
accessing my content through Chicago
instead of Germany so by by restrictions
this is one use case but you get the
idea anyone and everyone could benefit
from a VPN go to expressvpn comm forward
slash science or click the link below
and get three months free with a
one-year subscription all right so I
have the video up here now you see it's
only got about 29,000 views it's not too
much considering this channel it's 2.1
million subscribers but what attracts me
more than anything is this like to
dislike ratio here 839 up votes and then
1200 and roughly what sixteen or so down
votes and that's not good that's enough
that's an indication that the video is
either extremely controversial or
extremely inaccurate and you're gonna
find out here it's the latter of the two
it's kind of out of date and it's
definitely not gonna hold up for
Battlefield 5 so let's build a new one
you can build a gaming desktop for
around $1,000 but I want to go all out
so I spent around 2,000 and if you need
help choosing the right parts for your
build there are sites like PC part
picker com that helps you'll preset for
which parts fit together which sort of
part conflicts you might have and where
to find deals on new parts
okay so we're about two minutes in and
I'm not seeing anything too
controversial at this point I do think
that they've made a few generalizations
but nothing worth downloading the video
for so let's keep going and see how
cringe it actually gets here pay close
attention to the brace that goes at the
back of the computer you always have to
make sure that you really hammer it in
because there's no screw it girls
accessories side of the case and clasp
on to the frame it's pretty fast Ram
it's two thousand six hundred and sixty
six megahertz I believe so it's pretty
fast and this motherboard sidewall your
four standards that's not to with us now
wick Lane you cues depends entirely on
what other parts are gonna put in the
system I'm just gonna pick the top one
because the SSD is at the bottom and I
don't want to cover it I just think it
looks nice okay I was actually going to
elaborate on why his statement regarding
the PCIe slots is incorrect it's they're
not all the same first off and there are
bandwidth limits and not assuming that
these cars can hit those limits but
still they exist and that's why it
doesn't matter to an extent which slot
you plug those cards into but also I
just noticed that he has both of his RAM
modules to the far right side so he I
guess is completely avoiding dual
channel support because I mean this is
just some some other words won't even
boot like you can't even get to the BIOS
when you do this sometimes because
you're just you're just not supposed to
you have slot a which is usually the
second slot and the F slot B which is
this far-right slot but he just
completely ignored that I don't know if
he did it on purpose
maybe his cooler is too big we'll see
what cooler uses it eventually but
that's not correct that's actually super
cringy I chose Corsairs 850 watt power
supply because I need enough Headroom
for ray tracing GPUs when they come out
and I don't wanna have to upgrade it are
you sure you can get biology that is
take the brave a new card and make sure
that you align it with these little
insulating pads so the powers always
isn't short-circuit and come into
contact with the rest of the system I
gotta replay this I gotta I gotta make
sure I heard this correctly so all you
have to do is take the break uh-huh and
make sure that you align it with these
little insulating pads so the power
supply isn't short-circuit and come into
contact with the rest of the system so
that the power supply doesn't
short-circuit and come into contact with
the rest of
system so you heard it from the verge
first folks if you place your bear power
supply shell against your chassis while
your PC is on you will short-circuit
something guaranteed that is the most
idiotic thing I've ever heard
from any channel claiming to know
anything at all about pcs that is so
this David is so dumb I got here one
more time and make sure that you align
it with these little insulating pads so
the power supply isn't short-circuit and
come into contact with the rest of the
system slide it in nice and easy until
you have a snug fit and then send it to
the back and make sure it's right up
against the frame now you just take your
resource then okay so you're okay with
the power supply touching the backside
of the case but it can't touch the base
of the case because that's where it's
short-circuits I get it now so next step
we're going to install the CPU core and
this little bit on the top end of the
case and we're just gonna have the hose
hang out for the oil until we install
the processor which is gonna come a
little later next step is we're
connecting the power supply to the
motherboard with the 24 pin cable we're
just matching that cable from the
motherboard
threading it through the back and
attaching the 24 pin header to the power
supply just economics 101 cable at a
time as an EVP you for any specific
ports that the case has for any lighting
that the case has the CPU cooler okay
he's gonna keep that all on classic port
literally the entire time toss that out
of here okay don't say that in school
now we have an exposed CPU holder or
rather slot on the motherboard
you haven't even live in the socket
levering applicator this is a special
little part that not everyone may get
but this McGowan is Isis definitely does
have it's all CPU installation tool it
makes it really use you just dropped the
chip into the socket core i7 hexa core
CPU oh yeah yeah and you've got
Mauritian chip and he's got it grow and
it supports overclocking and light it up
with the triangles that you'll see on
the bottom left corner there's a
triangle that's more easier for us to
apply it to the motherboard and then
apply thermal paste and then you just
drop the CPU into the sockets gonna
carefully you literally just did it
and make sure that everything lines up
and we're gonna class you don't even
have the bracket on there I think you
realized halfway through filming that
that was completely pointless every CPU
hour actually comes with a base already
neatly applied and a circle around it
hmm but it's usually not enough it's
good
essentially PC building practice to have
a little bit extra and layer it on top
of the CPU you sandwich a third party
paste onto the IHS with stuff that's
already pre applied on to the Corsair
cooler or whatever cooler is using that
is so cringy I I just I've never seen
that before I've never heard that ever
recommended before it's probably not
recommended for a good reason probably
some weird air bubbles and stuff trapped
between them I don't know but I know
that that's not conventional and him
recommending this on a site like the
verge is just a little disappointing the
final portion is to add this you know
that application process my dad you
spread that all over Disney you're gonna
see that they're just just like let me
get his finger out of this move your
hand move your head look at that just
it's like he drew a little maze with
thermal paste all over the IHS and then
he's gonna sandwich that on top of what
he's already got pre applied on the
water block dirt this is they're going
to keep the cooler raised oh sure but
it's also gonna be close enough to
actually physically come in contact with
Italy basically keep it cool this is
pretty much what you would see me do on
a gaming computer test stuff out and
hopefully have really high frame rates
like I am right now that gaming PC
you've just built is way overkill for
League of Legends in 1080p so for this
to be your second game of choice to
showcase for this gaming PC build you've
done the entire build a disservice this
is kind of a joke at this point I'm
averaging 120 fps and then obviously
I've actually locked the game yeah that
framerate because I can get around 300
FPS playing League on maximum settings
you don't say it's a little bit absurd
and you don't really need that so
because you can't see that on the
monitor like that I've been a great
experience I'm able to max out a lot of
my favorite titles and I'll be able to
play a lot of upcoming titles like
battlefield 5 and cyber
2077 without worrying too much about the
parts I have and of course now we also
have a computer to test and benchmark
games here with the verb ok I need to go
back and look at this system because
installation media on it and address
resolution with ko screen didn't look
that worried all this fun stuff is
happening so we fully built the PC
everything's put together yeah
everything's put together Haley showed
it one second probably because he's
ashamed of it okay look he's got like
his 24-pin running through here he's got
I don't even know what that cable is I'm
a maybe it's his EPS and did he run this
eight pin through the front either this
case has terrible cable management or he
just doesn't know how to route cables
he's got a mess of cables down there he
didn't try to pull anything to the back
and he just didn't care to make it look
pretty and I'm sorry if you're on a
channel like the verge with 2.1 million
subs and you consider yourself you know
a tech enthusiast channel then you're
gonna want to keep things nice and tidy
if possible this literally would have
required like 20 seconds worth of cable
management but he didn't even want to
yank on cables because I don't know this
is like a parody video that's what it
feels like to me I mean look at this
thing and yes that was his 8 pin cable
so he has a penny PS running through the
front he's got his 24 pin just kind of
hanging he's got his VGA supplemental 8
pin looks like right there and he's it's
just a mess it's an ugly looking bill
definitely could have taken again a
minute or so to clean this up and then
it would have looked at least much more
presentable than the way he has it here
I don't know this just this just doesn't
look good
you know when the producer at the verge
makes statements like this you shouldn't
expect too much in the way of actual
content in my opinion what a pretentious
thing to say Phil we should all bow down
to your technical superiority right
because you guys type stuff and we film
it honestly if you were willing to
approve this video you have no place in
the computer journalism space anyway no
intended rhyme there I mean the guy on
camera might be completely hands-off
when it comes to production and that's
fine I'm not faulting him specifically I
just think that it definitely
could have been conveyed much better
than it was whoever wrote the script for
sure needs a refresher a really quick
one in regards to the PC building the
reason why I think they disabled
comments and likes and dislikes is
because they saw how many people gave
negative feedback in the comment
sections including myself
I literally pointed directly to the
timestamp where he talked about you know
short-circuiting your system when your
power supply is not standing on rubber
mats
I guess this what he was trying to say
no that makes sense that's all
misleading and you're going to tell
people how to build a PC the wrong way
and that's why a video like this exists
to shoot down any I don't know
misconception out there that this video
is accurate from the verge because it's
not anyone who's built any PC at all
ever knows that some of the things shown
in this video or not true leave a
comment down below this video thumbs up
that was cool check out our sponsor
again to expressvpn I appreciate their
support in this one and we'll catch you
in the next video this is science studio
thanks for cringing with us
