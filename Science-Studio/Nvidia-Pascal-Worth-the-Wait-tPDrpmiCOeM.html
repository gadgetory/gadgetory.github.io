their toes pascal is releasing this year
according to nvidia and people have been
asking me greg should I wait until
Pascal is released before I purchase a
new GPU or should I go ahead and
purchase something like a 970 or 980
currently so basically you're asking me
if it's worth waiting for a possibly
better graphics card and I think I have
the answer to your question stay tuned
we're gonna talk all about Pascal what
do we know about Pascal first artists
it's taking quite the toll on Nvidia CEO
Jensen Wong received quite a lot of
flack for showcasing the drive px to
board on stage which is supposed to
feature two Tegra chips and two Pascal
GPUs however the board he held in his
hand was fitted with makeshift Maxwell
based chips likely from the GTX 980 look
familiar so what does this mean
Nvidia might be a bit behind but they
swear by a 2016 release date and
computer enthusiasts couldn't be more
anxious for starters Pascal will utilize
a 16 enemy 2 platform comparable to
Polaris's 14 nanometer and will feature
support for DirectX 12 in terms of
performance the company claims
performance increases as high as 10
times that of the Titan X yeah that's no
joke of course the debut lineup will
likely underperform however according to
the CUDA compute performance of Pascal
it's probably possible probably another
exciting feature of Pascal is the
technology's ability to allow up to
eight way sli through NV link now it
would be absolutely ludicrous to pair
eight graphics cards in SLI or crossfire
for one the law of diminishing returns
would practically render the last few
cards in the line useless second you'd
probably need more than one power supply
to keep these graphics cards adequately
powered under full load and third no
current consumer CPU has enough PCIe
lanes to handle that many cards and wait
a second do they even sell standard
motherboards with room for eight
graphics cards say hello to macro ATX
everyone but I must digress Envy link is
very very fast anywhere from five to
twelve times faster than pcie 3.0
according to WCC F tech comm pesco will
also be the first architecture to
utilize a unique form of stacked memory
now without this getting too complicated
just know that the bandwidth speed
we'll approach one terabyte a second
which is approximately three times the
bandwidth of the Titan X this won't
translate to a sharp increase in FPS but
as an example lag as a result of
utilizing extremely dense texture packs
would practically be non-existent not
that that was ever a problem for the
Titan mind you additionally due to its
reduced size and 3d composure stackable
memory allows for up to 32 gigabytes of
video memory on a single PCB yet again
another ludicrous number but don't be
surprised of Nvidia allows all 32 into a
single high-end card just to gloat of it
essentially what AMD did with their
three 90s each GPU will be chained to
this second generation HBM via a 1024
bit memory bus as well which should
improve response times and again promote
the use of some fairly epic textures and
shaders for the sake of comparison
however NVIDIA GTX 980 utilized a
256-bit memory bus and AMD's r9 fury X
sported a 4096 bit bus just goes to show
you it's not about the size it's how you
use it nonetheless Pascal signifies a
substantial jump from Maxwell and should
pose quite the threat to AMD's
up-and-coming lineup dubbed polaris
click the card up top if you're
interested in checking out how AMD plans
to answer nvidia within the coming year
so here's my advice to those of you who
are expecting to purchase a new graphics
card at some point during this year if
you already have a pretty decent system
and you're playing games that the
resolution you wish I would wait wait
until Pascal these articles make passive
look very promising possibly even better
than Polaris oh that's gonna start some
very heated arguments in the comment
sections below I am waiting for all of
those I don't take sides because I'm
trying to be as objective as possible
Pascal looks pretty dang good according
to what I've seen but who knows
could be hype could not is Nvidia gonna
gonna kind of mislead us again like they
did with the GTX 970 who even more
debatable topics this is gonna get spicy
but now there's another scenario and
that scenario is the case in which you
have nothing currently you have no PC at
all no parts predisposed laying around
and you're gonna be building from
scratch in that case I do recommend you
going head and purchasing just a card
that's already available a GTX 960 is a
great card on a budget I have a
head-to-head comparison between that and
the GTX 970
you can click on the card above me and
watch a pretty unique perspective
between the two in terms of what you'll
be able to squeeze out of both cards if
you're diehard and you want to just ball
out in 4k purchase the 980 980 TI I
don't recommend the Titan of the Titan X
just because the FPS per dollar ratio is
pretty whacked out at that point
so as high as that would go is probably
the 980 TI you're gonna be pretty
disappointed if in your first computer
you purchase a Titan X for $1000 and
then you find out that your buddy who
purchased the TI for $600 is getting
about the same frame rates as you are so
make sure you do your research but a
happy building everyone I cannot wait
for Pascal to be in this studio and I
cannot wait for player 3 in the studio
because I will definitely be doing
multiple multiple head-to-head
comparisons between the multiple cards
in each lineup but besides that if
you're feeling especially opinionated
and there's nothing wrong with that go
ahead and leave a comment in the comment
section below if you feel like this
video deserve the thumbs up then click
on the thumbs up button but if you think
we did a terrible job here give the
video a thumbs down
apart from that be sure to subscribe if
you haven't already we'll be posting
some cool videos in regards to the
pentium g 4400 can we overclock it and
what kind of results should we expect
when it's paired with a GTX 970
all of that coming very soon this is
science studio thanks for learning with
us</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
