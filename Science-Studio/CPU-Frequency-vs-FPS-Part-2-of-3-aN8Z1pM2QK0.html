verse FPS series if you miss part 1 of
our series and go ahead click the card
above me and hop it over to that video
but in this particular part I plan on
pairing a G 4400 Pentium skylake CPU
with a gtx 970 overclocking it to 4.6
gigahertz running all the benchmarks
that i ran in the first segment of this
series and then doing this all over
again with the cpu clocked at only 3.6
gears so there's that 1 gigahertz
frequency as well and both of our CPUs
thus far have been clocked the same in
both scenarios so 4.6 for both and then
3.6 for both wow I'm getting a bunch of
messages I really should have buted my
phone sorry about that
so let's go ahead and see what the
results were for the second round of
tests featuring the Pentium G 4400
so a couple things I want to point out
from the results that we have thus far
our penny of G 4400 did very well
considering its limitations of only
being a 2 core 2 thread CPU it kept up
with our 66 in Turkey very well
especially in games like Grand Theft
Auto 5 where I would have expected the
Pentium to fall behind quite a bit
being that Grand Theft Auto 5 is a very
CPU intensive game while our minimums
and maximums were a bit lower our
average overall was actually pretty good
for a Pentium keep in mind that this CPU
is $65 so we're comparing a $65
processor with a $240 processor at least
that's what they cost here in the States
so the Pentium is doing very well
keeping up as much as it is with the
6600 K very surprising apart from that
there were definitely some games in
which the Pentium G 4400 did much better
when it was overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz
versus 3.6 keywords games that come to
mind are City skylines dying light and
left 4 dead 2 now left 4 dead 2 I
regarded as a very CPU intensive game
for the longest time but after seeing
these results I think I've been
convinced otherwise so if you're looking
to purchase a relatively cheap CPU
something like an Athlon 860 K 10 EMG
32:58 or even G 4400 there's nothing
wrong with purchasing any of those CPUs
you will receive massive gains when it
comes to gaming if you decide to
overclock them and that's what I want
you to take away from part 2 of this
series in part 3 I'm going to throw a
gtx 980 in with my 6600 k rig and we're
gonna see if increase in our cpu
frequency when our GPU is not a
bottleneck will give us any substantial
increase there so we've seen it with a
970 and you guys are telling me well
there's a little bit of a bottleneck
there maybe so maybe not we're gonna see
if there definitely is a bottleneck when
we throw a 980 in there if our CPU is
holding us back then that frequency
increase should yield a larger margin
right right we're gonna find out in part
3 if it's not in the car but me stay
tuned for it it's coming very soon I
want to hear from you as usual your
opinions are very very important to me
even if we don't agree at all don't be
shy just leave a comment in the comment
section below be sure to give this video
a thumbs up you think it deserves one
give it a thumbs down if you think it
doesn't any
