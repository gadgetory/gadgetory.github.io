name for a reason time to test out
something that makes absolutely no sense
in the real world but we're just curious
so we're going to do it anyway in this
video I threw in a GTX 1080 TI one of
the most powerful graphics cards you can
currently buy into a computer that's
sporting a six dollar CPU and that price
is a little iffy sometimes you can find
them for like four bucks on eBay
sometimes as much as ten because people
are greedy but if the most part its sub
10 US dollars that should say enough
about the CPU right there so without
further ado let's let's give it a go so
this is the PC here's the CPU heatsink
this very weird chassis kind of keeping
things stable this is a g2 10 I reviewed
this in a few videos check this one out
right here if you want more details on
that
I've also showcase this PC itself before
we've kind of done some benchmarks on it
in the past but what I want to do now as
I discussed earlier is replace the g2 10
with the beautiful accelerated GTX 10
atti now if you recall in a video I know
if we keep pointing the cards but if you
check out this video here I talked about
how this is a true two slot car it uses
the reference TI PCB and it's super thin
super narrow so we shouldn't have a
problem fitting it into the tight spaces
that you see in here I just pop this one
out there we go
get on in there this is like the
weirdest thing on YouTube right now oh
yeah she's in there okay another problem
I didn't think about we do not have an
810 and 610 VGA cable rather than this
power supply so we're gonna have to
power it using alternative methods
alright so I've got this 450 watt
Integra power supplied from fractal
design and I'm going to jumpstart with a
12 12 10 jumper here I recommend all
enthusiast PC builders have at least one
of these around good for troubleshooting
in the works and then of course to 810
VGA cables again this is only going to
be powering a graphics card so I'm not
worried about reaching the 450 watt
limit we should be okay there so this
will be powering the graphics card as
long as this jumped and plugged in it
should be feeding power at will and then
when we turn
PC on everything else should be powered
now the only other thing we need to
address here this is a super old hard
drive with Windows XP on it can't run
the latest Nvidia drivers on XP the
software isn't compatible so we're going
to have to use this right here which is
just uh where's this Toshiba SSD this
has Windows 10 on it so I'm going to
plug this in instead just hot-swap them
everything should be good to go once we
do that these ribbon cables though I am
so glad these are extinct okay
SATA out state of power out and then
this is an SSD we really don't need to
mount it anywhere there there we go just
stuff wrong inside that seems legit huh
it works now I need to plug in the
keyboard but apart from that we should
be good to go alright so this is
interesting I'm trying to boot into the
SSD you can see it right there Toshiba
TR 150 240 gigabyte it's detecting it
but it's not booting into it and I'm
wondering if it has something to do with
how old the other hardware is on board
so I'm going to see if I can select this
drive as the boot drive my god this is a
super old BIOS well I could not get
Windows 10 to load natively on the SSD
so it looks like we're going to be
installing it from scratch but that's
not a problem as long as we can actually
test out some games here shouldn't be
too big of an issue is it weird that a
pentium d is sporting a 165 Hertz
refresh rate right now just a little
weird okay so check this out all I'm
doing at this point is updating steam it
looks like the computer locked up
something locked up and you can see
cores 1 &amp;amp; 2 that's it no hyper threading
on this Pentium D 830 and CPU usage is
pretty much above 50% all the time
actually
what something did freeze the whole
computer froze I can still with the
mouse who would is oh there we go what
is going on so yeah you see pegged at
100% that is uh actually not surprising
here goes almost finished any guesses
any guesses on the score here Wow
point seven three points mind you and i7
is doing about
five so are you seeing this over 200 FPS
now we're just in the loading screen
mind you of left 4 dead 2 but that's
really freaking high okay one thing for
sure it takes forever to load anything
two hours later
okay so this whole thing did not go
according to plan I kind of expected
that if you notice right off the bat I
was running windows 32-bit this is
Windows 10 32-bit which is kind of an
ironic setting in itself because Windows
10 is really new and 32-bit operating
systems are kind of out the window by
this point but they do actually offer
Windows 10 32 I installed it and found
it that I could not test a majority of
the games that I wanted to test that
makes sense though so like grabs the
Tomb Raider GTA 5 a few other games
would not run on a 32-bit OS which meant
that I can only test either really old
games or games that are just not very
demanding in general so games like
Minecraft and then I actually was able
to get left 4 dead 2 to run I'm sorry
that I couldn't get GTA 5 and other
mainstream games to work although expect
something like this if we had been able
to get GTA 5 to run I do expect that the
game would have had several artifacts
issues that would have made it virtually
unplayable if you take nothing else away
from this video check out our cinnamon
scores our 1588 C be compared to a
typical i7 will score around a thousand
C be you're getting 10% of what you
could get from a processing standpoint
that is abysmal and 11.5 yeah that's
also very abysmal and another benchmark
that should clear things up even more
for you Geekbench 3 32-bit you know
don't even look at the scores they don't
even matter you're looking at an i5 7600
K and the pentium d 830 just look at how
big those bars are for the i-5 how tiny
they are for the pentium d that is so
embarrassing
so of the two games I actually was able
to test with this set up minecraft was a
bit of a letdown and left 4 dead 2 was
just straight-up unplayable I would say
unplayable I wasn't able to hold 60fps
with left 4 dead 2 I expected this to be
actually a pretty good situation even
though the CPU is clearly a severe
bottleneck in this case I expected the
GPU to just kind of do its thing and not
worry about the fact that there weren't
many things on the CPU side taking place
this game however does appear to
leverage a bit of both and the CPU is
definitely crippling our frame rate here
nothing anywhere near 60 FPS for a
majority of the experience as you can
see in the top left there with fraps
running that's your fraps counter up
there minecraft was a bit of the same it
ran a bit better
actually was kind of surprised about
this minecraft is a very weird game when
it comes to benchmarks it's a very weird
game when it just comes to gameplay in
general and your experience you can
change texture packs and do a bunch of
things that can really either leverage
your graphics card or leverage your CPU
in this case just vanilla minecraft the
latest updates around 30 40 fps not too
bad you could play it but I can play
just as fine on my ultra book and that
does not have a dedicated graphics
processor at all now I'm sure this
wasn't a learning experience for most of
you I expected most of you who are
watching this channel already know that
pairing a $700 graphics card with a six
dollar CPU is downright stupid you
didn't know that you don't mean to
offend you it just it is stupid just
even if you don't know anything about
CPUs or GPUs or prices whatever it just
doesn't make any sense but if there is
something you can take away from this
video it is this Czech CPU usage
especially when you're playing games
when you're doing things that involve
both CPU and GPU horsepower make sure
those usages aren't anywhere near a
hundred percent if they are that's
telling you that your CPU is at full
load or pretty darn close to it and you
should either upgrade your CPU raise
your frequency or I don't know do
something else on your PC with that if
you thought this video was cool if it's
satisfied gore morbid curiosity give
this one a thumbs up thumbs down for the
office to click subscribe button if you
haven't already and I'll catch you in
the next video this is science studio
