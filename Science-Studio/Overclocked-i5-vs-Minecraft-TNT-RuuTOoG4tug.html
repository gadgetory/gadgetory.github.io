minecraft at least once on that fancy
new gaming PC of yours or maybe on that
console in your living room or bedroom
or I don't know can you play minecraft
anywhere else I'll be honest it's a
pretty cool game it's open source you
can add texture pack you can add add-on
packs and completely change the physics
of the game it's it's just an open
platform you can do whatever you want
and I love games like that that's why I
played GTA 5 all the time you can do
whatever you want you can play with
friends you can play by yourself build
anything I'm not in GTA but you can
build anything in Minecraft that's
pretty cool but there are things in
Minecraft that definitely take a toll on
either your apu or your GPU or whatever
you have running in whatever rig you're
running the game on I should also
mention that this entire video is based
on a single youtube comment that I
received from a fellow youtuber who said
well if you really want to test just how
powerful your CPU is then need a bunch
of T&amp;amp;T and minecraft and see how low
your frames per second dip so I said I
wonder just how well our 4690k will be
able to handle tons of T and T being
detonated at the same time so here's how
things went down for the first test I
took a single one by one by one block of
TNT
set it in the middle of a pasture set a
lever next to that and then opened up
fraps what I did with fraps was I
started the frame per second counter ten
seconds before I pull the lever and then
I waited until the lever was pulled let
the explosion happen and then I counted
for ten more seconds until stopping that
frame per second recording I repeated
the exact same procedure for a three by
three by three block of TNT next so in
this case you know multiply three by
three by three simple volumetric
calculations there and that was 27
blocks and then for the third test I
stacked
five by five by five blocks of TNT into
a cube that's a hundred and twenty five
blocks of TNT in this case and then also
detonated that course remember doing the
same recording procedure 10 seconds
before is when I start and then I pull
the lever and then I wait 10 seconds
apiece
recording and then for the final finale
of sorts
I took a 10 by 10 by 10 lakh yes that it
is 10 times 10 times 10 that's 1,000
blocks of TNT in one cube that took
about 30 minutes to put together and I
detonated that and I did the same
procedure for that one as well you're
welcome
I know you were wondering we were like 5
by 5 by 5 is not enough I was I I know
what you're thinking so I did 10 by 10
by 10 just to satisfy those of you who
and I also recorded those results so
here are the results so you can see
right away that the one by one by one
block of TNT only barely dented my FPS
rate from about 600 to dip to about 400
frames per second so one single
explosion cut my friend per second rate
into two thirds of what it was before so
it went from 600 400 that's Wow for one
block of TNT it's actually kind of scary
when you think about it one explosion in
Minecraft shredded my frames per second
rate that's that's not that's actually
kind of discomforting things get further
discomforting when you take a look at
the three by three by three line this
line resulted in an FPS dip down to
nearly 200 frames per second so my
friends per second rate was literally
cut into thirds with that I went from
about 600 200 not cool at all things got
even worse with the 5 by 5 by 5 125 T&amp;amp;T
block explosion which resulted in a
severe FPS dip from about 650 to is
about a 100 so yeah it literally got cut
from 600 to 100 slice into 1/6 of the
frame rate that I was receiving before
that is not cool and then finally the
grand finale the 10 by 10 by 10 1000 TNT
block explosion resulted in a
disgraceful FPS dip from about 600
frames per second to 12 that's right an
$850 gaming
see dipped in frames from 600 to 12 all
because of one fairly large explosion
that is discomforting but that is pretty
awesome at the same time so there you
have it what you can take away from this
if you're wondering what what kind of
test is this Greg is that even if you
have a super super beefy computer we're
talking sixteen hundred seventeen
hundred dollars of you know six core
twelve thread gtx 980ti you have all the
goodies in the super awesome gaming pc
if you play minecraft and you decide to
blow things up
things will get pretty pretty bad take
it from me I've got a 4690k overclocked
to 4.4 gigahertz and that machine behind
me in an EVGA four gigabyte gtx 960
super super clock edition and i
experienced some pretty drastic
framerate dips it was as pretty
disgraceful and i really did not expect
that at all but uh thank you mr.
youtuber for suggesting such an
interesting video if you guys would like
to see more videos like this give me a
thumbs up let me know in the comments
below what else you have in store for
you know pushing our CPUs and GPUs to
the limit if you didn't like the video
though dislike it and let me know in the
comments why you didn't like it maybe
just because I decided to use minecraft
as my test bench of sorts I don't know
don't hate on minecraft it'sit's an okay
game for most people most people also be
sure to subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already we do cool things like
this all the time this is science studio
thanks for learning with us
