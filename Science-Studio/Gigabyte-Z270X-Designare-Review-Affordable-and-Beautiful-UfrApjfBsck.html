with the motherboards design my first
was the saber-tooth z1 70s from a Seuss
mothered in a white camouflage PCB and
packed with features on the Intel
platform the second was the recent ooh
gigabyte a X 370 gaming k7 motherboard
on the Rison platform and virtually
every feature imaginable and look sharp
in any case but this year the gigabyte Z
270x design air is one heck of a
motherboard that does not break the bank
I typically find a motherboard review
videos a bit odd apart from overclocking
potential which should be the same for
pretty much every motherboard within
that same chipset and features which you
can find on any website including
gigabytes own website for the
motherboard what else is there to talk
about in a video like this but with this
board I haven't hesitated to make a
video overclocking it's great 5
gigahertz on the i5 7600 K with zero
stability issues and apart from standard
sky and cable a CPU support the design
air also packs a few unique features
including front USB 3.1 support support
for Intel obtain if you are really into
that sort of thing of beastly onboard
audio chipset fully integrated RGB LED
arrays more on that here in a sec and a
dual BIOS setup in case you're into some
dirty overclocking this is a full sized
ATX motherboard which means that it will
consume all nine of your cases stand off
save may be the one in the middle that's
just used for guidance if you're worried
about fan support always something and I
look forward a motherboard that I'm
picking there are five dedicated fan
hubs with both PWM and voltage support
that's pretty much standard at this
point I would like to have seen maybe
one or two more that would definitely
eliminate the need for a fan hub if
you're worried about packing a ton of
fans into your PC boards like these seem
to have all the bells and whistles not
just the good looks you'll find
dedicated diagnostic LED support for ram
frequencies above 4 gigahertz and a
sweet silver alloy PCB a trademark of
the z2 70 X design air
I must confess I thought it'd be a bit
wider especially considering gigabytes
own ad use the words quote pure white to
describe it definitely not white my
walls are white this motherboard is not
I will say though that this will still
turn quite a few heads motherboards
nowadays are pretty much just they
they're not meant to be aesthetically
pleasing because most of the time you
can't see them so I will say that with
the right color combination for the
entire build this motherboard will be an
excellent complement I think any silver
case would look really good with the
silver PCB I mean look all the way
around the board it's all silver
everything you can think of it's not a
capacitor some kind of hinge is
completely silvered out the last
physical mention here should be rear i/o
support again you can read this on any
web site understand that but apart from
standard DVD and HDMI ports you'll find
a single USB type-c port for USB 3.1
genuine ports a single 3.1 gen2
interface two USB 2.0 headers an rj45
port 7.1 surround sound support with an
optical interface and a good old ps2
keyboard mouse connector for old-school
fun I find these things hilarious and
cool is same time on modern motherboards
I'm glad this one includes one now by
this point you might be wondering what
on earth I have planned for this
beautiful board I will not let something
like this just sit and collect dust so
you guessed it right I will be throwing
it into another custom loop PC build
I've got quite a surprise in store for
all of you we'll break it down into
maybe three parts it'll be a very long
expensive build probably very
complicated most custom new builds are
but I think that the looks are
definitely going to pay off the plan
involves an i7 7700 K custom cooled GTX
10 atti 32 gigabytes of ddr4 loads of
primo chill custom Luba gear in a
special case I'll be honest I haven't
decided on one yet oh and Tony over at
virility
once again hooking us up in the studio
with some super cool custom sleeve
cables these are silver and purple so I
guess that kind of reveals the color
scheme I'm going for here a silver build
with some purple accents including what
I expect to be purple fluid we're gonna
see what we can do with primo chills
current offerings and I think the cables
if you get the cables right the PC just
looks ten times better in my opinion
Tony's not let us down to date he is
super awesome check out his channel
linked in the video description so if
you've got anything special planned for
your next PC build like I do and want
intel on your side the Z 270x design air
is next to none well almost next to none
I'm not going to lie it follows a
similar color scheme as the
ms:i titanium z2 70 motherboard I can't
go without mentioning that but this is a
huge catch by the way this one from
gigabyte costs much less and packs
nearly the same amount of features into
an identical form factor that's right
gigabyte has completely wiped out MSI's
titanium motherboard line-up with this
price point super awesome glad to see
that kind of competition it means the
lower prices for you you have any
questions or concerns can be posed in
the comments below as always you can
find a link to the motherboard showcased
in this video in the video description
that is tied to my Amazon affiliate link
gives me a small kickback it lets me
make more videos like these push out
more reviews for all of you to kind of
just dive in to decide what you want for
your next PC build this is science
