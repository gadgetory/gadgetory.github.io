the be queit HQ in hamburg they're a
bunch of old systems behind me some are
new but a lot of these are comprised of
older components and the reason why is
because once these power supplies are
developed they have to be put through a
bunch of tests and obviously not
everybody who owns a PC is using the
most up-to-date hardware so be quite
likes to make sure that their power
supply still function on older hardware
which is usually not as power efficient
as their newer counterparts
now the person in this beautiful room is
Kristian Rex he is the technical
director of power supplies here it'd be
quiet and he's about to give us a full
tour of all the stuff that's in here so
this system here for example this is a
twelve thirteen hundred watt consumption
there isn't a 1300 1300 watt power
consumption right totally nice nice
regard along with our nine to nine 510 a
two who have to see us for four-way
cross fire and a big CPU Wow even gets
an older set of excessive hair yeah this
actually here you can see all my
changing systems because sometimes also
after cells have maybe some problems
from end user for compatibility so I
always keep the old systems can directly
change to test the power supplies and
figure out what it kind of problem they
have me so the further power supply is
to be able to deliver a lot of power and
it's very short amount of time that's
taxing on it on a PSU like the demand
for power being so quick now because of
just the ability for these cards to
fluctuate power demand so fast if this
is the main problem for the powder but
if you have a key power supply it you it
will easily shut down the system because
you cannot reach the very fast loading
changes right and our power supply from
straight power up to dark power all has
99% of their loading can provide the 12
volt only because the video cards and
the TV all all these 12 all right so and
here for example we do some testing for
the amp ere's go through the card and
comes out from the card so I use a
current probe here to see how is it
totally
distribution of the 12 occurrence it's
very interesting that not the Tavella
fault codes in BBJ card also comes out
from the ground because some current
also go through the TC i--'s log deck
and comes out from the fanny pocket for
a while so that's why we also need to
figure out how it is and then we can set
up our fault apply
it's amazing how big is the current
actually on each wire you can see he
already have 12 ampere going to the
video card NSSL times 12 volts correct
yes so 240 what already Wow
going from this cable in the VGA card
and you can see the backside the ground
is only less than 11 unpair so means 1
point 5 ampair goes somewhere comes not
back directly from here so it's going on
the motherboard sam yeah or he is more
critical this VJ card Oh
according amperes in and only 9 point
something okay out
so all others go to mainboard and in the
end you can see it comes here in this
guy's to be back to the parts of lat wow
we also we have a manual chroma you may
be in all this time yes yes well I'll
take it one down yeah this is actually
the same but only mate we call it
manually one so I can adjust the I'm
pissed on myself by programming here can
load my power supply and can see also
for the cross loading problems maybe
what is the voltage regulation and I can
also put my power supply connector here
with the longer wire put in my small
chamber and this I can heat up to 50
degree Wow so I also can test a very
reverse case for the power supply and
see what will happen in the high
temperature so you literally take a
power supply and you just plug all the
characters into here as you would a
regular motherboard and that's where the
power is being delivered yeah that's
where you can monitor and control it in
these boxes yes Wow but actually not
only test by this way because this is
just a passive locally so it's just like
a resistance right so if you want to
really understand the power supply you
need to really load it on the real
system right actually different story I
can control something I can make
frequencies here everything but you
never can make it like a real system
that's why they were testing them both
like they would test them on the chroma
and then never taken the real years and
that's why also a nexus year without
systems you cannot really make sure the
possibly really
right right how much is like just one
race chroma module cos you know the cost
for the whole set here actually they
said it's a power meter in here this
reloading units and the AC source is
around 20k oh wow around $20,000 right
if this is from chroma actually I know
like this more so actually that's why I
create my own one but it's not installed
yet haha my own email okay sir we did it
with the supplier together so actually
for me this is more easier to plug it
here always you need to use some
adapters because you don't have enough
connectors here
so this always have lost so I recreate
this one can better connect 24 pin p8
also means CPU 1gb you two and I have
four connectors for video cards and I
also can put SATA and molex here and I
can directly measure here also the
rouble noise I use golden connectors
here so it can directly detect by scope
and measure the ribbon noise like this
was like some kind of mining rig this is
actually I build a mining system but in
fact not really for mining we have an
account for sure but right there the
main point is I want to understand the
12 volt distribution to the system SS
because we saw and we found out that
many users do it in wrong way if they
have for example a VGA card and you have
normally this kind of bridges here you
need to support this by power and they
deliver a SATA adapter so if a plug from
power supply is outta here it's only one
wire normally twelve volt and what the
end users do is they have the cable
that's maybe for connector they can save
blah blah blah blah make four pieces on
one wire so they're falling a lot went
on just on the table is cost Jake that's
why I test here how is the best way to
connect it and then we make a small
briefing we also send to ourselves
and after self guide so they can teach
customers how to connect by and ability
to sum up with ten graphic cards yeah I
imagine to sell between about two
thousand eleven and we are lucky we got
the main board from the Mabel supplier
from the vendor to sorting PCI slot the
special mate for mining that's what's
funny is it's an h1 ten board like it's
not even like I talked here no man even
if I three only in yeah that's it yeah
that's why they were concerned about
like
and i3 prices you know because you don't
need a super powerful seat actually I
reach articles that many people use
silver on yeah yes I thought the
important is a young video card this I
built also by myself from totally
passive load without fan because the
problem is as a turn on this you cannot
check noise from the power supply
because I machine is too loud so I use
this way I can test my power without
noise so this one directly make 400 to
the power supply but without noise so I
can check very in detail if we have some
noise inside from components or from the
same because we develop a sentence about
yourself that's 400 watt Loretta this is
formal but Wow
and I have another one in my other room
is up to 800 baht so 400 watt came in
here you hear nothing and defense still
only that is the same voltage I always
measure okay only 2.9 to world so
actually just in the beginning nothing
actually we have some buffer inside also
from the component so the fan even up to
50 60 % just rotate in the beginning and
what we do beside other power supply
vendors is we always let the sense in
even in the beginning because you here
by yourself you cannot hear them right
right but the problem is if you use for
example is any passive solution when you
support a cause of like when they do
this so they up to 40% the fan will not
spin for example right right the problem
is your component getting more hot in
this situation and actually your
lifetime being much more shorter also to
prevent this because we also give the 5
years warranty for the power supply we
let the fan always been to have always
some airflow even very small but still
have air flow right to take the
components really think about it like
having it off versus having it on what
its lowest setting it's
indistinguishable so you'd rather get
the airflow and there's nothing to lose
really I'm like I know because I think a
lot of power supplies that do have that
like the auto shutoff mode it will just
stop turning the fan altogether but this
is what the component this is risk
actually right right and I also do the
design with our vendors together for the
PCB so for the component positions you
can see I always try to make big space
inside and put the components to out in
a minute in the center so I have very
good airflow in
really go in and directly comes out from
here so the fact that you have to be
able to route all those connections on
the TV it yourself so we make all the
see the daughter ports all those
connections and we found a layout to
make it smoothly without wires and at
the same time managed to keep as de
components far enough apart to allow for
altima airflow yeah it's always a big
work to design the power supply not only
from electronic aside from the logic
from the topologies also how where you
put the components and there are there
are also other rules you cannot move
maybe the main transformer too far away
from the SR otherwise you have too many
lost another one so you need to take
everything actually the topology similar
supplier ok but I work together with
them to move the things to what I
understand from my experience what is
the best airflow what is the best heat
consumption this power supply comes also
from FSP SSA ok we've worked with
several of them do have an idea we we
work with some different suppliers but
sure fsp is still our main a certain
volume ok
is that the same for the dark power is
ok FSP because they have the best
solution for the high quality high
wattage high level power slack right so
no hands get I have my small Museum here
with all the old hahaha power supplies
just like cabinet volunteers here yeah
but this is I can show you another room
this is stash right here really have an
entire floor dedicated to this power
supply stacked on top yeah because I
always need to test if end-user have
some question and it from every series
every model in my hands I cannot always
go to where else put another one out
right right oh I need to stock here now
the all the new power supplies Chris was
saying those all use the same modular
configuration so uses what I would I
have no actually our dark power our
straight new straight power show up
power zone and even pure power the cable
are competitive that scare each other
that's awesome
my viewers know why I keep asking that
question he showed us a stash over there
yeah and from from my job scene so I
control the developing I control the
quality management and the project
manager this was a beautiful around even
for me I like to sit here especially on
this desk there if I can solder
something do by hand work so we have the
fresh air yeah so how long have you been
in this position with the acquired
I work in this one or twelve use Target
and in this position for be quiet also
over ten years or ten years or Wow
I do the developing for it quite
possibly what is the noise it's kind of
rounded someone want to argue with me
maybe one of these guys better your ante
or something so these are reading power
just from being wrapped around the table
actually you know need to to tattoo to
make some connection
it's used by magnetic coil Oh make it
they measure the neck neck field XY is a
very good technology yeah that's really
cool to say like how because you're not
actually connecting anything physically
it is Kayla's it apart I did like this
so I built my adapters with the voltage
and amperage I need to put a wire here
connect to vga card connect to here or
energy our case we ampere perfect to
complicate this is much easier this is
really nice so this allows you to
isolate power consumption to each table
even I can just only use one wire or two
wire whatever I want easy easily to
change are these like available like
commercially available yeah I've
actually I bought this in I don't know
the you know the store Congress it's a
it's a very big store in Germany for
electronic things okay and the brand is
Warcraft so it's not so expensive
actually and no need
0.01 exactly no need in the area no need
to perfect if I want to have perfect
results I use my chroma right and right
then I have perfectly results but for
this to see the distribution of the
power is totally enough this is really
cool not to go on violence cure they get
for troubleshooting in general this
actually is 35 euro one piece for a
while yeah guys I just have the IVA
typical like what fluke voltmeters and
somewhere yeah like to play it the
program so you can't invent you high
current and diffuse from the from the
tool broken if you really long wires and
measure up to 100 amperes oh gosh yeah
anything PC related you can say fine
we'll probably check this out
a Quad SLI setup of GTX 260 s how many
of these are going to see in a lifetime
so he's got motherboard sorted by socket
type so 11 51 51 FM 2 a.m. 3 + LGA 2011
FM - 9 39 mm 1 a.m. 3 1155 1156 you
can't really see those but a good really
old here look at that
LGA 775 423 478 462
well we found a gap in the rain to
finally film the Astra for this video
it's pretty slow the other typical
Hamburg summer you know it's like you
know 16 Celsius and like showers going
down all the time and it's just crazy
and so this is just one part like of the
hole right yeah behind as you can see
actually like gather like half of the
main building and now you went there
just finished our tour and yeah what's
pretty interesting it was I love it we
appreciate you guys open up your doors
for us and yeah behind the scenes stuff
is really cool to see how all is
distributed how it's all tested
troubleshooted it's cool at all that's
on site and like we saw even the fact
that you guys had like just kind of
makeshift pcs to train people who don't
even have to work with PCs hands on just
so that they are familiar with the
cojones yeah exactly that's really nice
so they know each other at least the
basics you know when you're like you
know want to sell it you know you need
to know a little bit about it you know
that's good that's good so that's really
nice to see so we've had a lot to cover
today in this tour I think it's gonna be
two videos it's not more just because
there's so much to see so much to test
and find out that Kris really appreciate
you coming out it was really nice to you
to do this for us
yeah alright no worries when we back in
Germany very soon so alright thank you
