problem though
okay login oh geez come on no no I think
all of these will do it yeah
what is this crosswalks what am I even
looking at
are you tired for getting your passwords
introducing our sponsor LastPass the
leading online password manager securely
store multiple passwords and have them
automatically entered for you completely
hands-free just download the extension
or smartphone apps and let LastPass take
care of the rest
literally LastPass will create its own
complex passwords for your accounts and
you'll never have to care because
they'll be auto filled every time you
log in the only password you'll ever
have to use ever again is the one you
use to sign into your LastPass account
click the link below and get started for
free today I should begin by disclosing
the fact that I've switched periodically
in the past between iOS and Android I
can appreciate the simple minded
approach to such an operating system and
that's why I often switch between the
two I love iMessage camera quality slim
designs overall and a close but coherent
ecosystem it's one of the downsides as
well of iOS more than that is discussed
right here but I want to talk about the
latest Apple iPhone releases and which I
would choose if I had to choose so the
three phones look pretty familiar they
all have the notch and they're all
sporting a similar screen to body ratio
we'll talk more about that as well soon
to touch briefly on the notch I have
never really been a huge fan of it but
I've never outright hated it either I
understand the need for the space
wouldn't seen in the context of face ID
hardware I'm just bothered by the apps
that still don't support the indention
the specs for all three models - the XS
or the 10s depending on how you want to
say that the 10s max and 10 are are
fairly similar and more representative
of a product refresh than anything else
they all support the new a 12 ionic chip
which relies on the world's first 7 NM
your fabrication to hit the market Apple
calls it the smallest and the most
powerful chip ever in a smartphone it's
a bold claim but likely to hold up in
many respects the chip packs nearly 7
billion transistors into a mobile
package and if the few Geekbench leaks
we've seen are true we're looking at a
roughly 15% boost and single core
precision something you will
notice though not much is really change
with respect to multi-core support maybe
a small bump though it is very likely
Apple sacrificed much of this to benefit
efficiency and battery longevity this
will still make the a12 Bionic chip the
fastest mobile chip to date and I mean
to be completely honest iOS overhead is
pretty light by comparison so even if
this wasn't the case you'd probably be
alright the iPhone 10 are ships with
three gigs of RAM and most users won't
notice it's been shorted a gig more than
it's expensive counterparts
though it's worth noting that most
phones with a 700 plus a US dollar price
tag support at least four gigs it's more
or less just good practice the 10r also
has a lower screen resolution than that
of the 10s and 10's max at 1792 by 828
pixels it's more on par with the iPhone
se form factor if you're already used to
higher density displays to keep things
short and sweet it's something you will
notice don't let anyone tell you
otherwise also is it just me or are
these thick bezels ugly don't get me
wrong I love the high screen to body
ratio maybe not the notch but you know
what I mean the border just wraps all
the way around the screen as much
thicker then it's XS and Max
counterparts sure it may be easier to
hold and prevent miss clicks but it just
doesn't look very classy in my opinion
I'd much prefer thin top and bottom
Chin's like I have on the LGB 30 that's
just a personal thing the tenor doesn't
even come with 3d touch assuming you've
cared about that in the first place
these compromises reflect on the phone's
prices but we'll talk more about this
later in the video so to sum up this
launched the iPhone 10 S is expensive
and lacking in true upgrades in my
opinion similar to the iPhone 6s and
eight launches though performance jumps
were notably higher with those older
models and I understand that the a12
chip is a feat in them itself but for
asking prices as high as $1,500 with
Apple Care included wouldn't you be more
comfortable with the device you're
currently running that is assuming
you're not using a device it's 5 or 6
years old and really I mean these
Geekbench scores are to be taken with a
grain of salt
they don't always reflect perfectly with
real-world use either but the chip
deemed the most powerful chip ever in a
smartphone should honestly be expected
to bring more to the table
this assumption casts a grim shadow over
the entire launch and makes the prices
even more difficult to justify and that
begs the question which of these models
is most worth it definitely not the 10s
the max has a great deal of real estate
to work with but it costs more than many
gaming desktops and laptops the cheapest
of the models of 10r is packed full of
subtle compromises but is still probably
the best option if you're dying for an
upgrade consider potential iPhone 10
price drops in the future as well though
this is Apple we're talking about and as
someone who stopped buying iPhones after
the 7 release I'd feel more comfortable
with one of these just because I'm not
used to spending 1200 + USD on the phone
folks still running iPhone 6s or SD you
should probably consider moving up a few
tiers if their batteries are barely
holding up and that's usually the case
and while I normally recommend used
markets for budget-conscious fires Apple
products retain their original price is
better than Android alternatives so if I
had to sum this one up I'd say most
iPhone users are actually in a bind
right now if you're currently sporting
an iPhone 10 it makes absolutely no
sense to upgrade point-blank even if you
make a case for the new camera system
which looks arguably similar to the
pixel twos Apple still doesn't make up
for the 1k asking price that's assuming
you want the base model the original 10
was unique in many respects its price
was - but that's what people use to
justify right it was a totally new
design for a phone that many people
copied afterwards today we've got the
exact same frame the exact same
dimensions a screen with marginally
better contrast more defined stereo
speaker range still no headphone jack
we'll probably never see this again from
Apple and still super expensive maybe if
you need dual sim support you could make
a case but for now the true gem in my
opinion is the iPhone 10 our look I know
it's still an expensive phone $800 is
not small for most of us but when seen
in the context of the Apple ecosystem
assuming you have still an Apple watch
maybe an iMac or a MacBook Pro it's a
viable upgrade pass chances are you paid
something similar already for the phone
you're currently sporting whether it's
up front or in a contract so if it's a 6
success or even a 7 you may even be able
to sell that to bring the cost closer to
4 or 500 USD you know the difference
they're much more reasonable don't be
afraid of selling something on eBay or
Craigslist by the way more on that this
video right here so if you don't plan on
giving your phone to a family member or
a friend it's a wasted opportunity to me
selling things online is the best way to
recoup
your initial investment lisa is gonna
need to replace her iPhone seven when
she finally moves to the states I use
horizon and her European model isn't
compatible with my plan so the iPhone 10
R is probably the one will buy she also
likes the yellow option hits screen
maybe low respect but it's battery life
makes up for it out lasting even the
iPhone 8 plus apparently it seems like
the best option for people desiring to
stay completely within Apple's ecosystem
so again if you're rocking a MacBook or
a series watch the 10r makes the most
sense from a value perspective if you
want to again buy another iPhone at
least that's how I see it on paper the
new watches by the way look super cool
definitely something I'd like to review
in the future but as a gear s3 where I
can say that the fat gets pretty old
pretty fast I haven't even charged mine
in several weeks and or rarely use it
for anything other than to check the
time and they follow up in a dedicated
video with respect to that but for now
I'd like to hear what you think of the
new iPhone launches yay or nay leave a
comment down below I'll be sure to check
those out I give this video a thumbs up
you thought was cool dislike it for the
complete opposite feeling totally ok
with that
you hate everything about life you can
also just like it again totally ok with
that click that red subscribe button you
haven't already consider joining us
coming out a channel number if you want
to fancy with it and we'll catch you in
the next video we're gonna review our TX
cards very soon stay tuned I know we're
a little behind on that but at
benchmarks you guys know benchmark this
is science studio thanks for learning
