trying something a little different with
this live stream so you guys are my
guinea pigs I need you to tell me how it
looks to you this will depend on your
connection and I know that YouTube
servers aren't the best for this kind of
thing but I wanted to see if I could
push the envelope just a little bit so
what I'm doing is using a 1080p capture
card I need a 4k 60 capture card I
really do but I'm using a 1080p 61 right
now and then I'm trying to upscale the
4k excuse me I've scaled a 4k that's
looking pretty darn good at least to my
eyes let's see if we can click 4k 60
here make that big that's okay it's not
too bad what do you guys think what's
going on Portland Trail I am uh yeah
sorry there gonna be a bit of a delay
here it's been is gonna be more of a
delay now that I'm streaming 4k but I'm
looking pretty pretty crispy on screen
so I think I think we're gonna go ahead
maybe the camera slightly out of focus
that's going too far out of focus I
can't tell I can't get close enough to
see that looks good enough oh well just
trying to get it as good as I can get it
being a one-man show for the most part
Lisa's in the other room right now I
wanted to give her a little bit of a
break she's uh she's actually been
cooking some really good food lately she
cooked a really good dinner that's why
I'm slightly late to this one just
slightly it's like thirty minutes of it
anyway this is supposed to be really
relaxed obviously I have no script I
have really no agenda other than to
answer your questions I just wanted to
address Lisa not being here because she
has been in the last two so this is her
her weekend off I guess you could say
and bazinga says burned that shirt I am
Spanish bazinga how dare you I know they
suck at soccer this year but I was the
biggest fan
of their team back in was a 2012 yeah
2012 or 2010
I forget which year the Men's World Cup
hist every four but it's always
different than like the president races
and all that stuff so I'm at a sink but
yeah they were terrible the last one
that I saw the last World Cup wasn't too
wasn't too flattered with them I was big
when David via was in when he had you
know Ramos and coil and Casteel
all those guys on that team were just
awesome it was awesome to see all them
play at the same time and I'm glad that
I started watching and remembering those
games back then because they haven't
been that great really ever since so I
have more or less been rooting for
Germany now that I have Spain beaches
because it's not really worth rooting
for Spain at this point uh yeah let's
see here
it's going up a little bit ah science
studio what is your favorite favorite
tech youtuber and why it's a good
question I'm actually gonna pull up the
live stream on my phone so I can stop
looking to the left and start actually
looking into the camera my favorite you
tech YouTube reggae this question quite
a bit I kind of depends oh wow that was
sorry about that
my favorite is more than likely it
depends I mean III swap in and out of
favorite youtubers in general but my
favorite tech tuber I don't know I don't
really know if I have a favorite one I
like them all for different reasons and
I've said this multiple times in the
past I really like Kyle I liked it wit
because I liked his charismatic approach
to tech I think it's a really nice
refreshing sort of vibe that I get from
this channel I like Jays stuff because
he got me into water cooling heavy we've
done like two dozen water-cooled builds
custom water-cooled builds on the
channel since a year and a half ago and
a lot of that was because of him a lot
of that I was able to do because of his
videos so that's the reason why I really
like Jays channel
I like Paul I like gamers and exes for
the more technical stuff I like some of
the smaller guys I like a little dim I
like optimum tech quite a bit quite a
number of them out there and I like and
I like them all for different reasons so
it's I don't think it's fair for me to
just point out like my favorite one cuz
I really watch all of them but that was
those are kinda the ones off top my head
that that a ring a bell so let me know
in the chat with who you guys like the
most and why you like them I have the
chat pulled up now so this is good so I
can now look at the chat box and not
have to swing to the left every time we
have a question from Christopher
Christopher ye I've seen this YouTube
channel multiple times also a very good
channel
I saw your the PC bill that you bought
off of that guy it was actually a really
cool video that was the most recent when
I'd watch from you he has question are
you coming to CES the answer is of
course Mudd
of course I will be at CES and if you
are coming to Christopher then it would
be great to meet with you we kind of
just I don't know we're taking it pretty
easy this year what we're doing we have
right now we have four four sponsors for
CES and in those sponsor packages were
giving them pre-rolls and we're
guaranteeing coverage at CES that's kind
of our way of making sure they feel like
they get what they're paying for apart
from the pre rule side of things and
we're just totally upfront about that
we're gonna disclose everything that is
paid for by this event especially after
people were being accused of doing all
kinds of shady stuff at Computex this
year but so we have those four companies
for sure we're gonna cover and then
we're gonna try to cover maybe four more
it really depends it's tough for us
because there's just two of us going and
I know a lot of teams going or just two
people but we're trying to do like
dedicated videos for specific products
or specific companies so those videos
can be anywhere between five and ten
minutes long and when you're editing on
a small little laptop even with the
screen graphics is difficult and it
takes a long time to especially render
video so that's one of the reasons why I
remember at least tonight see at Kombi
tech
we stayed up for oh my gosh we grew up
till 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. at one point
editing videos we were like swapping
sleep schedules like I would fall asleep
and she would edit then I'd wake up and
she would fall asleep and I did it while
she was sleeping and it was like kind of
the cycle we had a I don't want have to
do that again I know she doesn't want to
do that again so we're trying to take a
little easier so we'll have plenty of
time to meet up potentially collab I
know we're gonna meet up with Bryan at
IKEA City again we always do so
hopefully hopefully we'll have something
good going something a little out of the
ordinary for CES this year for you guys
I see bazinga says hey have you checked
at the courser MP 510 specially close to
the same as Samsung but much lower price
I have not yet bazinga
I really haven't but I will very soon
I'm actually gonna put together a bunch
of different tests with storage drives
and talk about you know I'm gonna
document all the boot times all the game
load times all the scene load times all
that just like out there because while
the last video one drives was more
informative I I want the next video to
be very specific in regards to how fast
these drives are in the real world I
think that's what people were looking
for after they got the dose of you know
this is why nvme is what it is it's why
it's more expensive here's what to buy
if you're on a budget blah blah blah but
again this one's gonna be more technical
and more straightforward with regards to
what you're really getting in terms of
performance with a faster driver so the
slower one and will even throw a hard
drive in there just to show you a
nine-day difference between that and a
solid-state drive so we're gonna have a
bunch of that kind of all mashed up into
a single video here very soon again
though I do this by myself I don't have
a team of people here testing with me
and helping me out editing blah blah
blah so I am kind of at the mercy of my
own work ethic and how much time there
isn't a day but I will get to it I
assure you
let's see scrolling down here scrolling
down okay Zack Palacio what are your
thoughts on the Apple X serv X server
that we talked about I have no idea no
idea what it is never even heard of it
what did it bring it up list is that you
knew I didn't know what it was
gosh let's see how do you feel about the
iPad pro 2018 that I can't answer so
lisa has the iPad /
from last gen so not the one with the
wider screen has a narrower bezel the
new iPad pros have the a 12 X chip which
is an incredible chip not only because
it's a 7 nanometer TSMC chip but also
because it is just so dense there's 10
billion transistors inside an a 12 X
Bionic chip that is an incredible feat
you know it's not really apples feed
it's TSM C's feed but it's incredible -
Apple is able to get this right into
such a thin low profile and frankly I
mean whether you want to hash out the
viability of a tablet in 2018 I don't
think the prices are too ridiculous for
what you're getting in a tablet now
granted you're gonna be spending upwards
of a thousand dollars on a high-end iPad
pro but I don't think that people who
buy tablets know what they're going to
use a tablet for and they know what a
tablet can do and what it can't do with
respect to you know laptops and and what
they can do with Windows 10 or Mac OS I
think personally that iPads and other
tablets are kind of redundant at this
point phones are already big enough to
where I don't feel like I need extra
real estate to do the things that I
normally do on a mobile device and if I
want something that's really you know
powerful then I'll go with a laptop
instead of an iPad pro not because the
iPad pro is any less powerful I mean a
12-11 or the a 12 X chip is again super
powerful but at the same time it's an
iPad pro and it's running an iPad form
of iOS and I don't like that now if it
had Mac OS on the iPad pro then I might
reconsider but then you have to worry
about optimization a bunch of other
things specifically for those chips and
that's gonna be another whirlwind for
Apple I'm sure so we'll see how that all
plays out but that's just my personal
take on hype on iPads and other tablets
I do have a tablet it was actually sent
as a review sample and I haven't made
the review yet because I'm not sure if I
want to create a video where I just dump
on tablets in general and use that
hallway tablet it's like the pedestal
for that I don't think that's I only had
some right of me to do
my opinion on tablets was already pretty
negative to begin with when I sent it so
I'm not sure how I'm gonna approach that
but I do want to make a video at some
point maybe with multiple tablets in the
scene talking about my opinions on them
and then kind of leaving the door open
for you guys to express your own
opinions in the comments section you
guys seem to love that and so do I
frankly now let's see Jason I scored a
sick deal yesterday I 570 400 are X 48
gigs of ram 1 terabyte hard drive sever
PowerPC with razor headphones for 200
bucks wow that's a really good deal
where'd you get that you get it used I'm
assuming you got it use cyber PowerPC
it's a prebuilt
razor headphones - assuming they're
decent headphones
let's see bazinga says toward Lisa's
Christmas present you cannot do the
bazinga she's ok so first off I that's a
ton of money bazinga
you should stop doing that I appreciate
it that's a lot of money I Lisa her
Christmas present I'm not going to say
what it is on air because she does
usually watch these after they've been
archived on the channel but I got her
something I think she really needs and I
think she'll really like it it's very
resourceful
I think she's listening through the door
possibly in the kitchen so I'm not gonna
say too much more but I can guarantee
you this I'm a hundred percent sure that
money is going to go to something Lisa
buys at either Walmart or on Amazon or
something so rest assured she will get
her hands on it honestly she's really
good about it about budgets and all that
stuff that when she sees that she's
gonna get really excited so I thank you
bazinga I am going to scroll - let's see
plain star wants a shout out there's a
shout out plain star Cody Salak what's
going on Cody
Cody's a four-star general here in the
chat he is a force to our member meaning
he is a recurring member for I think six
months now and coming up on 7 so I
appreciate that Cody let's see scrolling
he's also a mod so if you want to act
Cody and ask him a question or whatever
you can certainly do that
okay lols cookie good question what
games do you think should have r-tx the
most this is my opinion obviously but I
really think the games that would
benefit most from this are the ones that
are not as framerate dependent at least
for right now because we are still
seeing sharp framerate dips when RT X or
anything equivalent to that is enabled
in gain like the XR and then there's the
whole argument that well battlefield 5
just appears better on screen with the
XR enabled because they pulled back some
of the RT X features in the game so
obviously it's gonna run better so
you're actually losing the thing that
you're trying to enable to an extent in
order to have a higher framerate and
that was the whole argument against
enabling T XR to begin with is you have
to drop your resolution to 1080p
assuming you're playing at a higher
refresh rate or a higher resolution
normally and then you also have to
experience a pretty hefty framerate cut
and in a first-person shooter that's not
something you should be really excited
about because those games do benefit
from higher frame rates they will I've
seen people argue this so many times but
you will play better I don't care who
you are you'll play better in the
first-person shooter with a higher
refresh rate and a higher frame rate
that's just how it is those games are
fast paced the reaction times are
quicker response times are quicker and
it's just it just feels more real and
and that has helped me personally helps
Lisa helps pretty much any professional
player and on the planets why they'll
play with high refresh rate screens and
that's why ID XR really does make sense
in that game I do think the game that
would benefit the most from the XR is
something along lines of like city
skylines where it's slower paced it's
like a simulation game so you want to
look real because that's the whole point
right you're trying to build something
that looks representative of the real
world and with mod city skylines look
looks practically real looks like you're
looking at a google satellite view of
something so I think enabling DXR and a
game like that would be pretty awesome
imagine like seeing reflections of
buildings and like the water right you
have like waterfront buildings and then
like the light at a certain time of day
is like reflecting off those buildings I
think that would be super cool in a game
like that because city skylines already
runs at around 50 to 60 FPS even with my
beefy system I'm still not really
breaking 60 especially when I pack on
mods and in 1440p or ultra wide
so I would really like to see it in the
game like that that's just my personal
preference I don't think I would ever
enable it in a game that were that you
know I would prefer a higher refresh
rate a racing game or a first-person
shooter especially so yeah I think the
implementation was just a little it was
a little premature I just I don't think
the drivers were ready and at the same
time I don't think that was the right
game which to showcase this you know
first ever game to feature real-time ray
tracing I just yeah it didn't play out
all that great in my book let's see yeah
Cody says congrats for graduating I
appreciate that
I'm done with school now that's such a
relief for those who don't know I've had
my my bachelor's my petroleum
engineering degree and I've been working
on my masters in Business Administration
online for the past year and a half so
while I've been doing youtube full-time
that's been like my side gig you know
typing up papers and taking tests for
management and statistics classes all
that stuff that applies to an MBA and I
finally finished actually at the end of
October and I graduated two days ago so
I had to drive from Florida all the way
to Lafayette Louisiana to graduate UL
and so I walked to stage got my my
diploma I haven't hung it up yet I have
my my undergrad degrees right there and
then I have my master's degree but it's
not in a plac yet so my brother actually
has that in his car and he's coming here
Saturday so he'll bring the plaque or
the whatever the little frame that we
have for the diploma and I'll put that
in there and hang it up again kinda I
don't know I feel like that's one thing
like I'm not ashamed to show that off
because that was like an accomplishment
that I had to go out of my way for to
make sure that that I you know I just
wanted to have it done and it's it's
refreshing to be finished so by the way
let me know if this dreams acting all
weird or whatever I again I'm kind of
experimenting with the 4k aspect of this
I notice it's slightly choppy here I
haven't lost any frames I'm looking at
it right now I'm seeing it kind of chop
up but I want to see if you guys are
noticing that maybe it's just me
probably it's just me
it looks like I'm running at 15 FPS
right now I really hope you guys don't
see that but if you do possibly type try
dropping down to like 720p and that
might help right now the CPU is under
like an 85 percent load this is a 2700 X
so that's all eight cores 16 threads
baby they're all under load right now in
stream labs we are running a twenty
thousand kilo bit per second bitrate so
the 20 megabytes per second excuse me 20
megabits per second and that is being
fed to the YouTube ingest server and
that ingest server is streaming in 4k so
the output should be max 4k 60 which is
nothing we've ever done before
and that 4k 60 should look smooth but
right now and playback it's not so not
too sure about that
someone said my mic is going into the
red it's not on my screen so I'm not
sure if you're hearing it peak but it's
not showing a peak here I'll turn it
down just a little bit in case it's a
acting weird yeah it's it is slowing
down a bit but I'm not dropping frames
so I'm kind of concerned about why it's
doing that I wonder if that's me or if
that's YouTube anyway yeah it's like 15
up yet it really looks like 15 a piss
yeah it's pretty thick but I do have it
as an output of 60 so I don't know I
don't know what's going on here let's
see I see him
what am i at yeah common FPS value 60
bicubic that's not really relevant and
yeah I don't know it just yeah it's I
know it's dropping frames Vladimir but
it's not me on my end dropping frames
it's YouTube's server its dropping those
frames is it's not it shows me how many
frames I'm dropping in stream lines when
it encodes it and it's showing 0.0%
dropped frames so unless I am I'm yeah
I'm concerned as to why it's
showing that
what if problem is I can't change this
without cutting out the stream huh let's
try this real quick it's up kid says you
mean Google made a mistake that's not
what whoops that was probably loud
Google made a mistake that's not
possible
yeah I really am not sure if it's me or
them it's not showing me that I'm
dropping any frames but I still could be
it could just be OBS it probably is me
to be honest just because YouTube is
already gonna be down sampling the
bitrate so I will let me cut out and cut
back in and see if that fixes it I'll
just drop the bitrate too
I should actually be in I should be
using the Nvidia encoder I have to 1080
s in this rig and I'm not using them at
all right now so I wonder if I could
encode with the 1080s
in sli and I wonder if they'll be able
to handle the bitrate let's see let's do
it would be a little experiment here I
know I'm choppy I know I'm at 15 I'm
glad I saw that and thank you guys for
letting me know and also letting me know
that I'm peaking again I wanted this to
I knew this would be slightly
problematic at least because I haven't
done this before so we're just gonna
play along with it let me see if I can
cut the stream out and then come right
back in I think that's possible and it's
probably not anyway if I don't come back
in like two minutes then there's a new
live stream that popped up but let's
give it a shot
worst case yeah I'll see you in the next
one
okay are we still alive I've never cut
out and cut packing before that looks a
lot smoother though I will say I hope
you guys can actually hear me though I'm
currently awkward if not so let's see if
that is in fact the case yeah I think it
is because right now I'm just looking at
my phone and I was what I was doing when
it was hurt he laughs again so let me
know how that looks
why if that's the case then I need to
have these I just need to use the Nvidia
encoder from now on yeah everyone's
saying much smoother that's really nice
and refreshing that's good to know the
thing said I told you it's the shirt
yeah I'm just staring at my face right
now on life than the life in camera but
anyway that looks so much better
Wow okay cool so I'll just act like that
didn't happen and we'll keep going on
with the questions let's see Cal
McCallum traveler sup Greg am I crazy
for wanting to build a Rison rig just so
I have one for fun totally have no
functional need for it yet for yet
another rig in the house I get it man
like when I first started building like
for for the channel kind of over and
over I had I had the itch man I was
building pcs practically every week and
I loved it because they gave me a chance
to try out new builds and new parts and
get to compare them to the old parts and
see which were the better value which
were the better vibe because that was
information I was able to pass on to you
guys and that was what kind of got the
channel off its feet and that's how we
gained a lot of subscribers up front was
because we were just testing stuff I was
building pcs out of pocket this is
before I was getting any sample from any
company and then I was selling those pcs
on Craigslist just so you know in the
local Louisiana area back when I lived
in Lafayette and yeah that was that was
really how I got started I have videos
talking about this in more detail but it
was I did it more or less in the
beginning just because it was fun and
then I realized that there was a big
following behind this and the people
were willing to subscribe and watch
videos that had to do with PC builds and
benchmarks and so I was like okay heck I
can kill two birds with one stone here I
can grow a YouTube channel I never
thought
ever become a big thing and I get to
enjoy what I do at the same time so yeah
that's why I am it's why I'm still doing
what I'm doing so I totally get it if
you want to just build one just to build
one maybe even try to flip it maybe you
can flip it for like fifty or a hundred
bucks people will pay a little bit more
for a fully used system or for a fully
built system that they don't have to
build themselves or maybe they don't
know how to build one I've done that
before quite a number of times they
usually charge yeah usually around ten
percent of whatever the total build cost
is just just for the build labor so if
it's a five hundred dollar build pretty
cheap build I won't charge but maybe
fifty bucks more for for the build for
the piece to be put together so that's
like my my fee basically for building it
for you and if you enjoy what you do and
you have some time to do it I think it's
worth a shot worst case your breakeven
or you know you lose just a tiny bit of
money but at least you know you can fill
out your market so that's an option fake
beats asks where is McLovin McLovin is
living his own life believe it or not he
has his own life he has a job and he's
still in school so he's working really
hard right now he's actually in the
process of what he's about to move so
yeah you know work and other things kind
of takes you places so yeah I did
actually just talk to him today we're
talking about cars and a couple of
things but he's doing well he's just you
know when we moved out like when I was
when I was in school I was still living
with my parents back home when I wasn't
in school so we were we live really
close to each other but now that you
know I'm in my own place he's in his own
place we kind of do our own things that
tends to be how it is but no hard
feelings or anything that's just people
part their own ways and and have to do
their own things so I do wish him all
the best and again I just talk to him so
he's doing really well if you're
wondering and you can always tweet at
him on Twitter
I'm sure he'll respond if he doesn't
just tag me and I'll make sure your
response to you let's see he okay Matt
asked good question would you consider
our TX 2080 a better deal than the
current 1080p a 1080i
despite the 3 gig vrm difference with
current pricing yeah most games are not
going to utilize a gigs of RAM it's just
of no system oh they'll use mostly hay
cakes a system ramp but very
difficult to peg eight gigs of video
memory even the higher end games even if
you want to max everything out of 4k
usually not going to hit eight gigs I
haven't come across an instance where
I've been playing in 4k and I max that
out now if you add texture packs and
other mods and stuff yes sure you're
probably hit that limit but under most
circumstances eight is enough
and that's exactly why Nvidia stuck with
just eight in those cards the 1080 Ti is
an exception to that and that's really
because it's a different it's a
different GPU and that you know the the
full version of that card the Titan
version has 12 gigs of v rams all they
do is just remove one of those little
memory chips but yeah and I'm not sure I
would say gigs is plenty again unless
you're going out of your way to fully
stack video RAM you're you're not gonna
really hit that limit at least I haven't
in my own personal experience and again
if this was a serious issue and video
would have put way more than 8 gigs of
of the RAM on these cards so that's my
take there let's see buh-buh-buh-buh
given Givenchy Givenchy Zowie EVGA gtx
1050 TI so good depends that's a really
big question any more specifics I need
to know what resolution you want to play
in what games you want to play what
ingame settings you want to run that's
yet I gotta be more specific than that I
can answer that question ah let's see
yeah Patriots 7 6 2 X good question what
game are you playing right now I have
been I must confess the games that I've
been playing recently the PC games on
Steam for the most part have been I
played pub G a lot I haven't played it
as much recently since I moved but I'm
gonna get back into that we're gonna be
playing pub G pretty much every week for
the most part with the folks on discord
if you want to join the public discord
you can do that it's linked down below
and that's the way you guys can play
along with myself and Brian and others
even Lisa joins us so we kind of have
like big pub G sessions and stuff that's
really fun so pub G City skylines I
really like a lot still I love just
packing on the mods you can make
make things look really any way you want
and that that's what I love about that
and then I've also this is my confession
I've been decide they'd add like a
little bit into runescape 3 now the
reason why I reason why I took me so
long to get into this is because I used
to play the old school runescape right
back when it was a de Bruin scape when I
was in middle school like oh gosh I was
13 12 or 13 years old when I was heavy
into that game and I remember right
around that time RS 3 came out and we
thought that was just like the trashiest
upgrade ever so we stopped playing
runescape and then eventually my brother
and I when we were in college we were
just trying to find ways to pass time
and and we ended up starting the old
school runescape we found out that that
was like actually a thing you could play
old school
and it was like playing you know the
original runescape back in the day we're
not the original but you know what I
mean
and then my brother pretty much maxed
out account out like he had 99s across
the board and I kind of stopped halfway
through but really when the channel
started taking off I just didn't have
enough time to afk that thing hard and
then I recently just started playing
runescape 3 because we thought it was
gonna be trash honest we honestly
thought I was gonna be trash and then we
kept playing and we've been playing ever
since so it's been 2 or 3 months now
since we started and we're still going
strong so I don't you know we're inscape
is still like my it's like a childhood
game so it's kind of weird to like admit
that on a live stream but it's just how
my pastime I don't know it's fun to see
progress and to get to do new things and
it's it's a great way to pass time
honestly when I'm like typing up a
script I can afk yeah Matt T says did I
just hear runescape yep now I'm gonna
watch the delay of the chat come in and
it's gonna be interesting
Oh see Matt C's playing it right now see
all right we got some we got some Mars 3
lurkers in the chat that's it that's
cool look you know yeah you got to be
bold enough to admit things you might be
ashamed of 5 years from now and I'm sure
when I have kids I'm gonna be pretty
ashamed of myself to tell them that
they're 20 well at that point I'll be 27
28 year old dad played for an escape
theory
you know it's just how I passed time
everyone has their own ways of passing
time and when I'm in the work zone it's
just a good way to take my mind off of
the BS of the day for just a tiny little
bit so I yeah it's how I how I flex the
muscles in the brain a little bit
let's see but Chris says I keep hearing
people say Navi and Xen are going to
crush Nvidia and Intel while I don't
doubt Andy will bring huge improvements
do you think a huge performance jump is
a reasonable possibility I actually have
a video coming out tomorrow about the
seven nanometer strife and a little bit
about Intel's 10 nanometer chef as well
we're gonna talk about why it's such a
big deal and why well yeah really just
that we're gonna talk very specific
about the architecture we're gonna talk
about the value we're gonna talk about
how we expect prices to fold out just
because you know these fabs are not
cheap and when you get down to seven
nanometers which doesn't describe the
size of the trend we talked about this
in a previous minute science episode I
actually linked a video that video
recently on Twitter seven nanometers
doesn't describe the size of the
transistor or the distance between the
source and the sink or the width of the
gate seven nanometers describes the
degree of precision in the dye how
specific how you know how crafty you can
be inside and if you are down to seven
nanometers worth of precision that
allows you to pack a lot more into the
same amount of space so that's why with
the a12 chip and the a12 X you have a
seven nanometer node but 10 million or
excuse me Trent 10 billion transistors
into a package that I believe is around
120 square millimeters so that's like
off the top of my head that's a lot
smaller than the surface of a penny and
to imagine 10 billion transistors into a
size that small it's pretty incredible
kind of mind-blowing and that's I mean
those are the benefits just off the top
of ringing the node to that extent but
there are several downsides as well
several challenges and when you have
that precision you have
you know you have wafers that don't come
out the way they should I expect we'll
see several several implementations of
higher core count chips using this
fabrication I think that we're going to
see an influx of lower core count chips
using this node just because by default
a lot more of these cores are going to
be defective or insignificant to the
extent that they're gonna disable those
cores and so we'll have very cheap and
affordable low core count sendto chips
but we'll have fairly expensive higher
core counts than two chips and that's
just because it is way more difficult
for these you know for these wafers to
come out in pristine condition when you
have such fine degrees of detail
involved so just picture that I mean
we're talking you know a couple widths
of human hair like a human well not even
not weighted smaller than that sorry
couple widths of human DNA that's what
it was I was writing the script now I
was trying to get you guys to visualize
it you'll see it again in the video
tomorrow but I was talking about you
know how small a seven nanometers take
one strand of your hair and it's like
fourteen thousand times smaller than
that that's seven nanometers and your
DNA is only two to three times smaller
than that from a width measurement so
that's that's the degree of precision
we're talking about here and we've gone
as far as you know using a single
phosphorous atom as a transistor it was
mounted silicon if you want to add to
silicon thickness to it - that changes
things but you at the point like we were
able to do a lot of things we didn't
think we could do in nineteen eighty or
ninety nine we thought we'd hit a wall
at around six or five nanometers but
we're past that now way past that and
it's because of the different
innovations coming out different ways to
solve the quantum tunneling problem and
you know the the price and the concerns
with with the fabrications and with the
manufacturing of these you know the
success rate for these fabrications is
quite low and that's one of the concerns
that TSMC has that's why a few people
have already backed out and we expect
he will take over those extra those
extra slots just to ramp up production
or at least to increase the total yield
because it's not going to be pretty
let's put it that way
we'll see okay ooh it's good question
rift mole is a $250 refurbished 1070
worth it I'm getting one for myself for
Christmas uh 250 is pretty good price
I've gotten 10 70s for as cheap as 200
actual as cheap as 220 with shipping so
if you can get one for 250 it's a pretty
good deal
it's refurbished so I assume it's
slightly better than just the generic
used quality so yeah I would jump on
that especially if you're interested in
like 1080p up to highest you know high
very high settings or 1440p high
settings even some life 4k but 10 1070
could handle very light but yeah
Johnson ping have you played battlefield
5 yet I have that's how I know I've seen
myself what DXR looks like on versus off
that's why I commented on I did want to
make a video on it because I felt like
it was just too centric it was just too
mainstream a few people had already done
that and I didn't want to just like give
my own opinion on the topic based on
what I saw on screen like you guys have
to download it and see it for yourself
and just you know I say that not because
of the visuals because if you see on
screen I can show you what it looks like
the difference is there aren't many big
differences but you have to see what
it's like in real time to play because
that's when you'll realize how hard DXR
hits your system and how hard your
framerate drops as a result in a lower
resolution mind you so that's that's why
it's that's why it's tough for me to
reconcile I talked about a little
earlier in the livestream and I've
talked about it extensively on Twitter
but that's my view so far on it and
until we see some big improvements so I
can get a before and after I I probably
won't upload a video on that specific
game let's see here la plays x99 still
worth buying depends on the price
everyone's got a price
look I mean for the most part you know
that platform is still viable depending
on the cpu get appropriate number of
PCIe lanes the motherboards themselves
pretty up-to-date I mean really I hold a
big stuff USB 3 PCIe 3 like that's all
up-to-date so that's good and really the
only things you're gonna be missing out
on or possibly possibly I don't know
type-c support you know like LEDs stuff
like that that was really at the point
when when RGB motherboards became like
just commonplace so you're not really
missing too much I think with x99 it's
still relatively modern and if you can
find the platform for pretty cheap and
get a CPU and motherboard and 16 to 32
gigs of ram I think you're gonna be
perfectly fine you're not gonna regret
that choice especially for the right
price
okay cooker wants a wish of luck for
finals you have all - yeah I have all -
a day you have all - a day for the next
three days oh you have so you have two
per day so you have six in total yeah
I'm so glad I'm done I thought I can't
say I'm so glad I'm finished with school
I yeah hos really good old days not
really this sucked but I can tell you
that the feeling of accomplishment at
the end of it is in its own right worth
it so study I invite you to study over
watching this stream please
the stream will be here when you get
back your test might not be but uh yeah
I do wish you luck III have been there
totally hundred percent I understand
sure sure I you how you say it can arise
in five twenty six hundred with the RT X
2070 handle 1440p gaming absolutely
that's a good combo Andrew LaRoque right
now I have a risin and I need better Ram
I'm running eight gigs of 2400 should I
buy another a gig stick or splurge and
buy a new set of sixteen gig alright so
I really depends if you are running I'm
not sure what rising CPU you're running
if you're running first gen Rison then
you're gonna want something that's
specifically optimized for risin
forms so I talked about this a few
videos ago but there are certain kits of
RAM that you can buy that say you know
compatible with AMD Rison and those will
typically allow you to overclock to
around 3,000 megahertz know at that
point 3000 megahertz that's where you
see the the latency is between CC X's
which is what ultimately cripples rise
in platforms when you have slower Ram
that's when you see those ladies latency
is really start to taper off so there's
a law of diminishing returns passed
around 2800 megahertz
you won't see much of an improvement
between twenty eight hundred and thirty
two hundred megahertz so if you're
around 3000 megahertz that's the sweet
spot in my own testing and I've verified
this with several others online who have
actually like ty and Layton sees and so
I would recommend around a 3,000
megahertz kit if you're gonna stay with
that Rison platform for the next three
or four years then yes I say scrap that
a gig kit and get a fresh new kit of 16
gigs worth of 3,000 megahertz ddr4 again
that's compatible assuming a Verizon
first gen with the rising platform that
will let you either run XMP or manually
overclock your RAM to 3000 megahertz
assuming you have a motherboard that
also supports it and you'll be okay and
you will see a frame rate bump as a
result because the latency between those
CC X's not necessarily between cores
within the same CCX because those are
all tied those Layton sees are really
really low but between CC X's that's
when it gets really that's when it gets
really slow
relatively speaking and that's why you
want that faster memory so yeah that's
what I would do that was you
sub kids a 999 super chip my dude game
of the year for 2018 mine's Assassin's
Creed Odyssey good question I in all
fairness I can't comment fully yet
because Assassin's Creed is not a game
that I have played personally I've just
been chucked a ton with it I frankly
bought it just a benchmark with so I I
don't know I think the game of the year
2018 in my opinion and I'm this again
I'm saying this because I haven't played
it but I've seen all the reviews I think
a consensus is probably read - ever done
Red Dead Redemption - I feel like that's
a de facto answer but I feel like it's a
safe place so that's where I'm gonna
that's where I'm gonna leave it I think
people were upset with a few rollouts I
had it especially with the online play
but I think it's going to be another
thing like GTA 5 area that people are
gonna play for years to come just
because of the online experience
so I will see how that plays out I have
a ps4 Pro and I'm I'm on the fence about
buying Red Dead Redemption - I just I
don't know yet it's a lot of money and I
don't know if I have a lot of time to
even get through the game but we'll see
I know a lot of people liked it so yeah
Chris - Dalek super check Chris says
thanks the response can't wait for the
vid I ate that Chris and I hope that it
serves you well let's see scrolling down
Moke engine what do you think of it the
ex 5650 CPU good question
brian has personally asked me about this
I think it's a really great CPU actually
and I will I'm gonna try to put together
a build like that and I'm gonna use
Brian basically for the entire duration
of that experiment I'm gonna have to
probably have him as a special guest on
the channel for that specific video
because I just don't know enough about
the platform I really don't know enough
about 1366 or 775 to feel comfortable
just jumping into it on my own I've done
it a couple times but there are
different motherboard compatibilities
and CPU compatibility some CPUs don't
work with certain LGA 7075 motherboards
and 1366 is a platform that I really
like the socket that I really haven't
did you know dove into so yeah I will be
getting one soon and that's when I can
fully comment but I do have hopes to put
one to get there let's see here okay
lots of good questions Tom Brown says
Odyssey is fun that's good to know I
probably will play it I think I should
play it spent like 60 bucks on it so I
should be straight my money's worth
there Portland trailed Easter command ax
370 gaming k7 if I recommend it then I
recommend it now I mean I have my
opinions on the motherboards themselves
not gonna change assuming at X 370 if
you have rise in first gen it's still a
great motherboard so yeah unless some
weird BIOS update changes everything
about what that board most people aren't
even updating their UEFI so yeah if I
said that it was good then then it's
good now unless something comes to my
attention that changes my opinion which
from other boards rarely happens
let's see okay
yeah Rodriguez I know you have a lot of
your plate but is there any way you can
make a vid on how to manually overclock
ddr4 Ram thanks I haven't found a good
video yet are you talking about tweaking
timings and cast latency and stuff like
that because that's way more technical
that's nothing that I ever personally do
so the reason why I haven't made a video
on that is because I don't think that
it's worth it and I I don't even know
fully how to do it I know what I'm doing
but I don't know enough about it to make
a video on it and that is another reason
why it's not on the channel but I really
don't think that it applies to most if
not all average consumers out there
you're just not going to see a huge
benefit possibly you can make the
argument for the for the original Rison
platform but honestly if the if the kid
of RAM is just stubborn to begin with or
it's not it's not gonna work with that
specific about the board you can't run X
and P you can't manually overclock past
2666 or so then it's just that's it
that's all you're gonna get I mean you
can tweak timings and whatnot but you're
still gonna hit a road block at some
point it's probably very close to the
point you already hit if you're talking
about manually overclocking just your
frequency that's a different story you
can just very simply go into your BIOS
click on your DRAM settings and then you
can change your DRAM frequency now if
you set it to say 3000 megahertz and
your kid of Ram is only expected for
2400 don't be surprised if that doesn't
work
that's where tweaking your latency and
caste come in and and your timing excuse
me and you know you have to tweak your
timings to get that frequency hot but
remember when you increase your
frequency your timings have to go up
typically too and you can't have one
with something you know having higher
timings versus higher frequency it kind
of usually trade-offs so you're you're
not really doing yourself any good to
tweak with timings in my opinion unless
you're going for something very specific
so yeah it's a very simple process to
just change your DRAM frequency but if
you want to overclock way past spec and
I advisors getting a new kit around
because you're gonna see more harm done
than good and a lot of time wasted let's
see here let's scroll back up just
okay Christian Silva what a i/o CPU
cooler do you currently recommend the H
150 - cooler from Corsair is a very good
AI Oh aesthetically I like the decoy iOS
always have that is something that I
make no secret of I just like the way
they look they're not the best
performers but they look good they're
not too expensive used a couple
coolermaster a iOS they're pretty good
too
a little louder in my opinion but again
you might find them for pretty cheap
cracking X 62 is from NZXT are good I
really any of them from a reputable
company that have decent reviews for the
most part are going to be safe bats if I
had to pick one specifically for
performance it would be a cooler it
would be a corsair h 100 i or h 150 i
aesthetically it would be deep Coolio
captain 240 X captain 360 I'm running a
captain 360 right now my personal rig so
yeah hopefully that gets you started
let's see here Jeff Phillip says did I
miss anything
yeah it's quite a bit you missed me
filling with my camera a little bit but
I think we're doing all right we're
doing we're doing okay we have a super
chat from Scott what's going on Scott
I'm considering buying a used 1080 ti or
a 2080 soon as a 2080 worth the extra
200 bucks they're waiting til I can
afford 22 TI of 1080 at the moment okay
I got this question very similar to this
question like 20 minutes ago but I will
say if you have to spend an extra 200 or
so bucks I'm 2080
my opinion to get the 1080 TI they're
very similar performers they trade blows
literally like within 5 fps at a high
frame rate like 140 or 150 fps you're
getting you know within 5 frame rates of
that with the other card so you play you
know a blind view test like a you know
if I just give you a double blind test
and which ones which you wouldn't know
the difference so from that perspective
alone I think you just picked a card
that's cheaper that's my take unless
they're within 50 bucks of each other
then you might could rationalize getting
the newer car because it's got the newer
architecture and it might handle the
newer games a little better there's an
argument for that and I get it but when
we're talking about $200 difference like
200 bucks is a that's a price that you
could put into a
better graphics card or a better CPU or
more RAM or more memory or not memory
but more storage you get the point like
better cooler weight way better cooler
for 200 bucks impacts yourself out so
yeah I think at 200 bucks it just
doesn't make sense but if you're talking
about a 50 dollar difference then yeah
and say 50 bucks is that you know get to
get the newer cart just because but yeah
at 200 or Delta I'd take it at any DTI
now like if you don't need anything
other than a 1080 TI if you're fine with
your 1080 frankly and you just want to
see an upgrade you want to see a bump
and frame rate 1080 T is fine I don't
know what you expect to do with your
system I didn't have enough info in that
super chat but that's my take
let's see here scrolling down is that
Zed EJ what about H 100 I Pro I
literally said H 100 I that's what I
meant like I was talking about that one
that's still a good a IO from cooler
course there let's see yeah low graphics
TV yo Greg is the MSI optics mag 24 1c a
good monitor no idea I don't know which
one that one is a monitor names throw me
first spin anyway but I haven't tested
that one personally I don't think so I
can't answer the question
EB F - no stupid check my dude if risin
- is incapable of 5 gigahertz will
single core equal Intel I don't know
what you're asking why I can assume I
know what you're asking
so hopefully this is what you're asking
you're basically asking if risin to or
sent well if zento can't reach 5
gigahertz does that mean that Intel
still gonna be the IP cking and I don't
know yet
we don't know enough about either
architecture to really speculate beyond
just a rough guess my expectation is
that Zen 2 is not gonna reach 5
gigahertz I would be very surprised if
we saw 5 gigahertz out of these CPUs
especially with the first few batches
and that's just because again seven and
a seven nanometer fabrication is very
very specific that is a very difficult
thing to manufacture sure TMC is already
doing it but they're doing it on a much
smaller scale for
or phones for mobile devices but seven
nanometers for GPUs and CPUs it's going
to be very technically difficult it is I
mean they said that it is because
they're producing them right now but if
they hit 5 gigahertz and we can assume
Intel's going to do the same in-house
then it's gonna be very close it already
is very close I mean frankly you know
Verizon second gen IPC is not far off
from it from Intel's if you clock them
if you put them at the same clock speed
there's virtually no difference they're
very similar the advantage is of course
that's where the clock speed does come
in right and Intel has always been the
overclocking well not always but
recently they've been the better
overclocking chips at the expensive heat
though mind you buy the heat output with
Intel chips is very high especially in
those smaller chips the 9900 K is a
freaking firecracker as is the 8700 K
unless you want to deal it it and the
1900 K as a soldered chip and I really
wish I could still deal with it because
it doesn't look like a solder is doing
much at all
so I'm not sure but uh if I had to guess
they're gonna get close to 5 but they
might not hit 5 I don't expect all will
hit 5 and most of them probably won't
I think Intel's gonna barely squeak by I
think they're still gonna be just barely
ahead only because of the overclocking
support assuming that Intel can keep
that up if they can't with the 10
nanometer stuff they gotta come in late
2019 we presume then Intel might take it
and if Intel takes it or then excuse me
then AMD might take it and if AMD takes
it then look I'll be happy if Intel
doesn't take it but AMD gets pretty darn
close I'll still be very happy because
that means that consumers literally get
to choose just on the basis of price and
I freaking love that because that's how
it should be we should have that kind of
competition in the market but we don't
right now we don't partly because
Intel's behind on the 14 nanometer stuff
with the chipsets especially when they
just went to tsmc and said hey can you
help us produce our own CPUs because we
can't keep up with the demand
that's why prices for Intel CPUs went up
recently we have a video talking about
that that you know that's stuff that you
guys have to consider
and when you you know if you think back
to a time when you had healthy
competition in the CPU space I mean gosh
back when the choice between even as
early as the FX 8350 and the i7 and 2600
all right I don't know I it's I think
we'll have really healthy competition in
2020 that's where I see just everything
kind of culminating and I'm waiting for
it right now we don't have it I think
that still right now the better value is
rising the better performer is typically
Intel depends on what you're doing for
gaming it's been Intel most of you guys
are gamers that's why you subscribe
that's why Intel is the preferred CP for
that and I've made no secret of my
support for Intel in the case of just
games but when it comes to doing other
things like streaming like streaming is
really multi-core intensive that's where
the core count matters it's you know the
the field narrows definitely narrows so
depending where you wanna spend your
money at this point for for that
multi-core experience with the for the
you know multitasking workloads I don't
know what do you guys think
let's see Scott says he needs 150 plus
FPS at 2k which 1080p can can't on many
games I depends on your in-game settings
again Scott it really depends if you're
willing to drop some ingame settings you
could get 150 FPS in 1080p with a 1080
I've gotten over 150 FPS and like GTA 5
and 1080p with a 1080 so I don't know
which games you're talking about but I
think you're fine right now on a 1080 if
you drop something game settings okay
let's see I'm gonna scroll down just a
little bit and I missed a couple in that
little chat there but but no one that
starts to do a plan for new years just
gonna hang out here make some more
videos I'm a very boring person I'm glad
I have Lisa here she keeps me a little
more active she pulls me out of the
apartment makes me makes me live life a
little more so I'm sure we'll do
something exciting but for the most part
just working okay
but the BA let's see yes Steve wants 5
gigahertz on Zen 2 would be nice
super razor is what is clear CMOS that
will reset your BIOS configuration
so if you have an overclock and you have
a fan curve and anything else if you
could hit the clear CMOS button then
you're gonna wipe your bio settings to
stock that's effectively what that does
okay let's see
ACS I'm about halfway through my
Bachelor of Science degree program and
want to reach out to industry
professionals such as yourself but feel
like I'm few but feel like I'll fall
through the cracks suggestions I don't
know what your degree is I don't know
what your what your goal is trying to
reach out to us for what I don't I don't
really know I need you to tell me what
you are looking for what your goal is
EB F I know the super chat mundo you
fifty word limit at two das the league
state five gigahertz boost on most
rising to but you understand my
statement and thanks I use 8700 K but I
was just wondering yeah I see what
extent you want to call those leaks
viable I
I have very I have very public
reservations about those leaks first off
very specific leaks like it's almost
like the entire like breakdown of prices
and frequencies just all at one time got
pushed to this leaker and he sent those
to detect channels that talk about leaks
and I just haven't I looked at the spec
sheet seems just just a little too good
to be true just just a little bit if amy
does it great that's great but I'm just
I'm here to tell you don't be surprised
if it ain't what it comes to you know if
it isn't what you expect it to be or
what you saw it was in the leak they
call it a leak but it's probably I think
there's some degree of misinformation
there we'll see we'll see
not that that person who leaked it has
any motive to mislead people but I just
think that it in my experience in this
industry which isn't a ton of experience
with respect to other people but I know
a thing or two about this stuff that
does not look realistic in my opinion so
we'll see again again this comes down to
how efficient and how effective and what
the yields are on these processes at TMC
we'll see but like I said I expect we'll
have a pretty affordable
price point for the lower core count
chips one to two CC X's higher core
count chips if we have 16 cores I'm
assuming we'll have 4 CC X's right 4
cores per cc X then that's where it's
gonna get really expensive because
that's gonna get very technically
difficult to do to manufacture for those
at the same time that aren't going to be
somewhat degraded to the extent that you
have to disable one or two of those
cores we'll see we'll see Adrienne wants
a shout out there's your shoutout
Adrienne what's going on I'm gonna
scroll down here laughing cheese how do
you plan to conquer the universe one
planet at a time my friend one planet at
a time I like to start with smaller
planets first and you just go in nice
and easy you're not too aggressive you
just you know you pop into the
atmosphere and you take that megaphone
you're like I am your new ruler and then
you just take off you just move on to
the next planet a bit like how Rome
conquered half of the known world right
they basically invaded and then they
said you guys can keep doing what your
traditional e doing we're not gonna
change too much about your lifestyle
about your culture you just have to pay
a tax to Caesar effectively and that
worked for Rome for quite a while I mean
we know why Rome fell apart or well
there are a few ways that Rome could
have done things better the Roman Empire
but I think the way in which they
conquered and ruled was effective and
that it wasn't extremely invasive so if
you want to conquer which I mean I don't
think that's a I think it's a good topic
for this channel but if you wanted to
conquer planets or conquer countries
then you should do it in a way that does
not appear divisive and that does not
appear aggressive because if you do make
it seem aggressive then you will have
casualties you'll you know you're gonna
push back on your own plan to an extent
so you can't come on strong get these
people into it YZ planets into it you
know on a grand scale
not sure how I would go about doing that
but it definitely wouldn't be aggressive
I wouldn't be Genghis Khan running
between planets and nuking everybody
like that's not how you do it first off
you're gonna destroy all the resources
and just draw the people or whatever
creatures aliens are on those planets
but uh yeah one point at a time
Moke engine says yes he's joined the
dark side uh yeah okay let's see Oh two
Studios what's the probability of having
extraterrestrial life existence I don't
really know the probability but I know
those odds are I don't know I just think
the odds are high I can't see how I went
with Lisa to just the middle nowhere I'd
we went there on purpose no light
pollution within 50 miles
which still wasn't enough at the end of
the day but I took the a7s2 really great
little I performance and bump the ice a
little bit
bump the exposure up to ten seconds or
the shutter speed and see what are you
doing down there what are you doing
she's biting cables and we just took
pictures of sky and you know you can
only see in most cities anywhere between
100 to maybe 500 stars you could see
thousands just with the naked eye when
you're just surrounded by nothing when
there's no light around you to to to you
know
pollute the atmosphere so to speak and
it's just hard to imagine like you're
just looking at one galaxy and you're
not even seeing the whole gate you're
seeing just a small part of it and there
are millions and millions of other
galaxies out there and millions and
millions of stars in each of those
galaxies billions and some of them have
planets some don't some have more than
one planet orbiting some don't some of
those planets are in Goldilocks zone
some art but to tell me that all those
planets don't have any degree of life at
all
I mean anything that would remotely
resemble depends on what you want to
classify the life but I would say
something that reacts to its environment
something that has its own I don't want
to say DNA it might be something totally
different there but yeah I just think
something that reacts that responds to
stimuli right like a plant or something
along those lines that's life and that's
what we need to find in order to
actually be able to say there is life in
the universe but I wouldn't be surprised
if
tomorrow NASA said we found life on
so-and-so planet no even if it was in
our own galaxy wouldn't be surprised
I would I would frankly be I'm gonna be
like yeah I can see that I would I'd
probably I probably expect it I kind of
do expect it but I will see it's just uh
yeah we'll see yeah it would be pretty
boring if there weren't aliens I think
everybody thinks that aliens are gonna
be like super intelligent like flying
around in UFOs and stuff that to me is
you know you can argue both ways about
that but I think to say that there is no
life at all in the universe period I
mean you can't say that first off
because you don't know but I can say
that the odds if I had to engage them
are pretty high pretty favorable for
life because worked out pretty great for
here for us here on earth and it doesn't
have to be intelligent could just be
algae or something resembling algae on
another planet that's life that's it
that's all you need that's the only
evidence you need to answer the question
correctly so ya know we'll see
but Poppa demon king Loki says go home
Greg you're drunk
nothing I'm drunk I think I'm just
speaking my mind I think that's I think
it's perfectly logical to assume that
there's something out there so you know
no no that's just my take you guys don't
have to agree but I don't think I think
calling me drunk is a little far-fetched
I think it's a little out there I I just
I think it's closed-minded and frankly
ignorant to think that we are the only
life forms in the known universe I mean
we thought that everything orbited
around us at one point we were so
self-centered as a humans as a species
that we thought the whole universe
orbited around us and we very quickly
found out hurry abruptly found out that
that was not true so what else is there
that we think we were the only ones in
the universe to have or what makes us so
special we'll see we'll see that's all I
gotta say
but Papa okay here we go yeah we got the
flat earthers I see you I see the
flutter Patriot what is at area 50
want Pepsi's eating a box right now
she's uh she's eating cardboard and now
she's trying to get out you guys want to
see Pepsi for a second see if I can get
it yeah
want to see the good people you okay I
like that
no she doesn't like that hey be nice hey
hello nice trying to bite me she's
trying to bite me
all right so there's Pepsi's a little
law this Pepsi's a little ten seconds of
fame troll says I like your Jersey oh um
it's leaf are a lot of 1080 T eyes dying
or should you hold off on buying I mean
if they're dying then you should hold
off on buying I think it's rather
isolate I don't think it's a big deal
but I have been watching I have been
paying attention to it and I think it's
worth noting so we will see I think if
there was anything really serious about
these we'd be getting recalls and in
video would be doing all this different
research into why they're failing and
what specifically is causing this but
we're not really seeing that so I'm not
too sure if I'm willing to just say
don't buy 22t eyes again it's it's
fairly isolated if it dies then almost
always you can refund it or get a
replacement card if you're really
worried about it I don't blame you it's
your money it's a lot of money 422 TI I
don't recommend you buy a 22 TI at least
right now while the prices are so
outrageous but if you insist then my
opinion would be just get a twenty
eighty or if you want to drop just a
little bit more 2070 1080 1080 TI gets
you get 1080p 1440p performance but for
4k the only true 4k card honestly is a
22 TI so if you want that then you're
gonna have to take the risk
ultimately if you want to hold offshore
- but I can't really answer the question
of whether or not it's worth waiting
because I don't know how bad that you
need the card so that's where that
aspect comes into play you have to
consider
that for yourself let's see uh uh my cat
enjoys fighting the rug we have a like
we wanted to buy a really cheap rug and
then I saw this nice rug at Walmart
believe it or not at Walmart it was a
eighty bucks
spend 80 bucks on a rug but we bought it
anyway and we bought a matching little
skinny rug that goes in a little hallway
here and Pepsi just claws the heck out
of it and I'd like I don't know it's
just annoying because that that rug is
gonna be destroyed I already know in
like a year tops
and that $80 rug is gonna go to waste
and yeah it's probably living with cats
yes it's really difficult to train them
and then tell them where they can
scratch him where they can she has a big
trap house we call it just you know a
big carpet tree and she's got the rope
where she can like claw and stuff and
whenever she starts doing it on the
couch we just take her over there but
she'll see she still that's wherever she
wants so I don't know I'm training cat
sisters yeah let's see here silent fan
thank you for your memberships on the
fan says Greg is that cosmic themed
galaxy in your desktop wallpaper can you
see it yeah it's like a it's like a
purplish galaxy in matches oh I just
noticed that the computer has blue fans
on now it should be purple
anyway the fans are usually like a pink
purple color and that matches the
wallpaper so it's a really cool little
color vibe going but yeah so I'm have to
change that back but yeah I like the
wallpaper a lot I just rip them from
Google I don't you know just something
that looks good in the background what
the color vibe I got going on the cut in
the computer that's my my way let's see
here a couple more questions maybe
something good troll mcdhh rolling
tonigh hate how they rolled out there
big boy card at the start why would
anyone buy their low cards when they
came out actually it's all about
marketing and it's actually really smart
than Nvidia did it this way most
companies do it this way so when you
have a really expensive product you
expect fewer people are going to buy
that product because it's inherently
more expensive so take the 22 TI
those cards still were selling out I
mean it's not like these cards aren't
falling off the shelves they are they
were at least at the beginning but 20 VT
is selling for 1,200 bucks they know
that they're gonna grab less of the
overall consumer base with that price
point but if you had cheaper cards roll
out first then everyone would go and buy
the cheaper card including those who
could afford the more expensive card
right because it's the new thing and
then by the time the newer cards rolled
out later on down the line less of the
people who could afford the newer card
will actually buy the new record so it's
all about supply and demand the demand
for the cheaper cards is much greater so
you build up that demand you build up
that hype and you weed out the ones who
are willing to spend more money on the
more expensive hardware up front
by offering the more expensive card
first so it's actually marketing like
that so it's like a that's pretty
conventional
there's nothing shady about that it's
just they want to maximize profit and
most companies if not all of them do
that companies I know what they're doing
anyway so yeah that's normal
let's see Adrian says no super chat for
international subscribers there should
be so you should be able to super try
anywhere I get super chests from people
in New Zealand and India and everywhere
else so it's probably on you on your
side not letting you do that
let's see but Baba a couple more
questions
p7 21 what are the advantages of an i7
9700 K over the AMD 2700 X the FPS aside
in games an advantage I would say is the
discreet graphic well not discreet but
the integrated graphics processor the
9700 has that and the 2700 X does not
it's one thing that I do wish rise in
CPU had was an IG P they don't which
means that you can't just run a cable
directly into the motherboard like a
HDMI or anything like that if you're
just running like a risin 1700 or 2700
or what-have-you the only ones that you
can do that for are the other ones with
Vega graphics the 2200 G and the 2400 G
so that's one I guess Pro for the Intel
chip it's also going to benefit you to
have the IGP in certain programs like
premiere premiere with the quick sing
support
allows you to utilize the IGP in
conjunction with your graphics card to
do a lot of the rendering in production
and post so it's it's convenient it
depends on the the use case again but if
I had to choose between those two for
say streaming I would choose a 2700 X in
my opinion that's the better buy for
that so it depends again on the use case
scenario alright one more question let's
see here one more question
okay David wants me to answer he says
please notice my comment I'm the one who
had messaged you on Facebook before I've
got a question for you by the Auris 1080
TI hybrid hybrid what 2080 should I
upgrade to I don't think he's seeing my
comment you want you want to upgrade to
a 2080 but you have a 1080 TI hybrid
that's not going to be an upgrade it's
gonna make a side grade I don't if you
want to know which one I have videos
talking about the best RT X cards the
best RT X 2080 I reviewed two of them
the asus strix is my opinion the best so
I hope that answers your question let's
see yeah good question Tom Brown you
watch Game of Thrones I do not I have
not fallen into that trap I know people
love it but I haven't watched it on
purpose in defiance because I insist on
being weird and that's really the extent
to that one I imagined at some point
soon I will watch it I do have an HBO
subscription so I can do it right now I
just have to commit and I'm just not
enough I'm not in a committing mood
right now I comes to TV series well
we'll see okay let's see
Scorpio Casey says I'm late AF yes yeah
you are
we're literally about and I need help I
accidentally got thermal paste on my CP
pins and it's a new CPU well you're
gonna have to be very meticulous and
scrub that puppy because you don't want
huh you definitely don't want any
thermal paste on the tips of the pins
cuz that's what makes contact with the
motherboard socket and a PGA array so
clean it up that's all I can really tell
ya
and I think what we're gonna do now yeah
rubbing alcohol
I used to mean yep yeah that's my fault
I would say rubbing alcohol for sure use
like a q-tip something that's preferably
lint-free it's gonna be difficult to get
that lint out of it when you know cuz
the pins in be very careful with the
pins as well because the pins if it was
a LGA socket I didn't see which one it
was
he said CPU pins yeah so it's PGA so you
have an A and B CP more than likely and
yeah that's that's a good good starting
point good luck with that that sucks
Oh Tech Crimson things I watch anime huh
no not really
my brother watches more anime than way
more animal than I do if you want to
call like Dragon Ball Z anime I guess
it's for the extended one piece and yeah
I never I could just never got into
those it just wasn't my thing I don't
know not that they're not cool it just
never I never watched an episode that
was like oh I gotta watch the rest of
this I watched Naruto a little bit
whether you want to call that anime or
not but I just I don't know it takes a
lot for me to get into the show it's
just a preference thing all right you
guys you know what to do this is the end
of the stream so you're going to spam
your favorite emojis in the chat and I
will give you personal shoutouts we do
this basically at the end of every
livestream so I want you to open up your
keyboard emoji tab I know you have it
don't be ashamed everyone for the most
part has an emoji to have in a keyboard
even if you don't use it open it up and
you're gonna send me your favorite emoji
and I'm going to wait here to shout you
guys out and I'm going to thank you for
it assuming I can see all of you it'll
be difficult to do but uh we're gonna
try we're gonna try this tech crimson
already did it
I see all those emojis he was already
ready to go see that so yeah we're just
gonna what you got a spam I'm waiting
for you guys and again thank you for
joining the stream Sunday night here
10:46 p.m. Central Standard Time
if it is early morning for you in Europe
or somewhere else on the planet I do
appreciate you stopping by I'm still
waiting on those emojis I know it's
delayed it's my fault
I see Portland Trail
there we go tech crimson is spamming
hardcore but you have my permission to
do so don't worry you're not gonna get
in trouble for it Tom Brown Portland
Trail sure sure sure I you
yeah totally said that right maybe mock
mock engine I see you pop-tart army
Scorpio KC gaming qualif Latif ebf nut

these names I apologize in advance
I see sub-zero again I see Leo again I
see butters DB you guys are awesome Evan
said there's 1 p.m. in Australia oh
that's cool Evan so it's not too bad for
you guys over there then lemon gust
Cameron da drian Lopez what's going on
loopy tech the whole point is a spam
emojis loopy tech you probably just got
here but we always end every stream with
an emoji spam so congratulations you
just join the end of stream
Florin oprea savage dabs your name
that's that's this person's name is your
name Tech Network are those potatoes
potatoes Johnson ping Zachary Palacio
and mr. KF gaming yo okay of gaming you
joined last minute but it's good to see
you again my friend Nelson Lopez Wes Wes
oh gosh Intel ops Marko Eskom SS
Camellia I think I said that right
the psychics been be you guys are
awesome and stay tuned for next week's
After Hours livestream hope you enjoyed
this one thanks for playing along for
helping me out with the with the stream
itself I think we got it figured out I
am just up sampling from 1080p to 4k
looks pretty good I'll watch it and play
back
tweak a few things but hopefully we'll
have 4k six you ready to go next week
without any issues we are streaming
we're encoding using the Nvidia encoder
so right now I think the ten eighties
are doing better than the 2700 X was at
this bitrate so interesting to note I
will probably make a video on this at
some point but right now we're streaming
at 20,000 kilobits per second which is
fairly high but for 4k that's okay
because YouTube drops that down to
between 10 and 13 I believe megabits per
second which is pretty low for 4k but
it's good enough for a live stream so
anyway you guys are awesome I'm going to
sign out now this is science to do after
hours thanks for watching whatever time
you might be times when you might be in
right now and I'll catch you in
tomorrow's video I think you really
enjoy it stay tuned for that and yeah
I'm gonna hit the button oh here we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
