strand of dog hair hanging from my cheek
you can blame this creature right here
every now and then on this channel we
have the opportunity to review a
smartphone this is about the fourth or
fifth review in this channel but this
isn't typically where you go to find
your typical smartphone and review
speaking of which we're going to talk
about it's quarks it's weird features
and then we're going to take it on the
road and see how it drew weight so the
wrong channel okay we might still talk
about its quirks it does have a few of
those and it also looks familiar
looks very familiar what's kind of like
an iPhone 7 plus I'd like you to meet
the Xiaomi me six a beautiful flagship
from China
sorry
this phone gets extremely dirty
fingerprints dust all that just sticks
to this thing like a magnet it reminds
me away of the iPhone 7 and 7 plus jet
black series phones they're just they're
just fingerprint magnets and dust seems
to find its way all over this device so
for those of you who are unfamiliar with
this brand of this phone in particular
Xiaomi is a very popular smartphone
brand in China it's actually one of the
largest manufacturers of smartphones in
the world but we don't hear about here
in the States because pretty much all of
it takes place in China and the me six
is their latest attempt at a smartphone
flagship I've got to say pulling it out
of the box using it for a few days my
impressions this is an awesome phone
especially for the price I would have
chosen this over my daily driver the
Samsung Galaxy s7 any day of the week
it's sporting a Snapdragon 835 octa-core
processor pretty much top-of-the-line by
this point in 2017 to the comparison
here between this and s7 and six
gigabytes of RAM which is phenomenally
large for a phone of this caliber five
point one five inch displays only 1080p
and IPS but I would say that 1080p in
its ratio and the screen size is
actually sufficient you don't see any
pixels anyway really can't see the
difference between that and 1440p
display she gets super super close and
the fact that it's a lower resolution
means that it's battery life will last
considerably longer than the s7
counterpart build quality is immaculate
this is something that I'm always
concerned about with Chinese knockoffs
if you will but this really doesn't give
you that impression at all this is a
phone that feels like it belongs in the
top tier I'm talking along with the
oneplus 5 the Samsung Galaxy
cs8 the LGG six and even the iPhone 7
and the upcoming iPhone 8 and with the
price of around 400 US dollars this has
to be one of the best feeling
smartphones ever that I've ever held and
I've held quite a few smartphones I used
to buy and sell them all the time on
Craigslist this feels better in the hand
in the iPhone 7 and better in the hand
than the s7 I can say that with
confidence now let's talk about this
screen a bit more up to 600 nits of
brightness which is comparable to my
MacBooks brightness that's pretty
incredible in itself and down to a mere
one NIT of the ultra night mode display
if you want this thing to get super dark
on you that's not a problem here it just
be cautious you barely even be able to
think anything even got eye care on
board to filter out that extra
high-energy visible blue light something
else I have to say the contrast ratio of
this IPS display is freaking awesome I
was convinced at one point I'm not going
to lie that this was a Super AMOLED
display actually had to double check
online to make sure it was IPS the
blacks here look very black it's really
good I think the contrast ratios 1350 to
one that's not infinite of course but it
looks very convincing and a screen
resolution of 1080p combined with 30 350
million power battery gives you easily a
full day's use I've actually had this
last about twice as long as I have seven
to date that's because my seventh
battery she's been slowly dwindling down
to a mere like six hours of daily use
it's pretty bad I've only owned this
phone for about six months or so I'm
kind of disappointed with how the
battery life has degraded so much over
time if I have this phone and six months
I'll be sure to give you a follow-up on
this battery life as well but for now
this is a bigger battery than the s7 and
the screen size is almost identical to
get seven so I expect that this phone
will just have a longer battery life in
general they were able to squeeze such a
big battery into this small phone as
well I'm actually quite impressed with
that that's something I want to bring up
about water resistance this is
technically only splash resistant this
actually isn't water resistant either
this is just IP 68 splash proof so you
could dunk this in a cup of water you're
not supposed to but it would probably be
okay
this phone on the other hand is not IP
rated it's just splash proof so I'm not
sure I would feel as comfortable dunking
this in a cup of water although I'm sure
it would be okay if you just dunked it
in pull it back out there are still
connections that are exposed there on
this phone as well but I think this
would bear just
bit better because it does have that IP
rating now I kind of overlooked the
graphics performance in this video
understand that it's porting the same
Adreno 540 that the Samsung Galaxy s8 8
+ + 1 + 5 are at the HTC u 11 every
flagship for the most part you can think
of by this point in 2017 is sporting the
adrenal 540 it's a beast of a graphics
processor in a mobile phone and around
any mobile game you want I didn't see
any hitches at all playing the few games
that I played on here now let's talk
about this dual camera setup back here
for a lot of people the camera is a make
or break this is one of those things
that kind of speaks to the build quality
of the phone the camera quality is not
that great then the whole phone just
feels less impressive and this was going
to be the make-or-break for me with the
me 6 I have to say though I am extremely
impressed so each of these cameras is
slightly different of course they're
both using 12 megapixel sensors but one
has an extra lens piece this is the wide
angle lens it also has a shorter focal
length and a wider aperture the second
camera what they're calling the
telephoto camera has twice the focal
length of the first camera and has an F
2.6 aperture so it won't do as well in
low-light situations but it will give
you twice the zoom of the first camera
and you don't have to lose any
resolution at all so this has the flare
of both the iPhone 7 plus and the LG G 6
which I see nothing wrong with it's a
pretty good combination the G 6 had an
ultra wide-angle lens and a fairly
narrow lens the iPhone 7 plus had one
camera but the focal length of 28
millimeters the other with a focal
length of 56 that's how you get this
cool like double focus shots on the
iPhone 7 plus now while this can't focus
on two things at once which to be frank
isn't that big of a deal I think very
few people are going to use that feature
on the iPhone 7 plus this does have the
ultra wide-angle lens on the first
camera so you get quite a lot in your
field of view for that first camera and
then if you want to zoom in twice as far
without losing any resolution you can do
that by switching to the second camera
as easy as clicking this button right
here and you can see that despite having
a smaller aperture on the second camera
the zoom feature does fairly well
outside in daylight brightness and
contrast look pretty good especially at
Auto mode I would say that the inside
the bluish tint in these photos is a bit
unnerving I think the white balance
could be adjusted a bit more for a
picture taken inside the s7 though to be
frank has the same issue although it's
pictures tend to look a bit more green
for some reasons you can only really
tell if you compare these side-by-side
but that's just how these cameras are
calibrated depends on where they're
calibrated and in what lighting
situations a negative feature both the
s7 and the v6 sport though when it comes
to color reproduction is over saturation
on their rear cameras I would say that
the s7 is a bit worse in this regard
Samsung phones have always been this way
though I found that even the s3 and the
galaxy s2 tended to over saturate colors
this isn't too big a deal though and I
think that the Super AMOLED screen makes
things look a bit worse video quality
also pretty consistent on this phone
you're looking at some examples now this
is a side-by-side comparison between the
v6 and the galaxy s7 so you get kind of
like a 4k versus 4k comparison of sorts
I will say though that the me 6 is a bit
strange in the way that it handles video
I would say that the 4k 30 option is
pretty much mandatory at this point but
it does not include a 1080p 60fps option
only 1080p 30 in fact to get 60fps you
have to go all the way down to 720p I
would much prefer the 1080p 60fps option
over the 720p 120 FPS option but I mean
that's what they went with it's really
only choice we have here the galaxy s7
by the way will record in 1080p 60 and
it does a fairly good job at it you know
I got to be honest here I did not test
the front camera at all I don't even get
there here we go okay stick shot that
look too bad alright look it's guessing
my age no way it says age 23 male
there's no way well if I squint it
thinks I'm older I need to do this from
now on I've got to say while this isn't
the most accurate thing in the world
it's pretty cool that it shows me how
old I am and let's check video quality
in the front looking pretty good I have
no idea what resolution this is but I
know no looks decent on camera hopefully
looks decent on YouTube as well that
front camera by the way 8 megapixels I
expect that in the flagship also 1080p
recording resolution now another trait
of the music that will have you
second-guessing whether or not they
completely ripped off the iPhone 7 is
the fact that it has 2 speakers so it's
going to stereo speaker array and it
uses the earpiece for the first and the
speaker on the bottom I think it's the
bottom right bottom right this one here
as the second speaker this one is a bit
louder but I will say that the clarity
in both is satisfactory oh and something
else you may have caught down here there
is no headphone jack so guess what that
means folks you got to use
movies right here this isn't the
lightning to three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone jack but this is the USB C
which is the charging port here USB
type-c two a three a half millimeter
headphone jack yep we are back to this
and this right here is just screaming
iPhone seven seven plus I don't know I
don't know what to think about this I'm
going to keep this in here for the rest
of the video so that you know you know
other traits the music shares with the
iPhone seven the fact that there is no
removable battery but of course you kind
of have to expect that with build
quality like this you sacrifice the
removable back panel for just a better
feel in the hand this glass here is not
going to be coming out easily and that's
something I am willing to accept I will
take the compromise of not removing the
battery for the sake of having a phone
that looks better all around the Mystics
also does not have an SD card slot that
it has two SIM card slots which I guess
is cool for those who travel a lot but
even my global s7 only has one SIM card
slot instead uses the second slot for
expandable storage this phone only has
64 gigs of internal storage that might
be enough for some it's enough for me
but it might not be enough for you so
having that expandable storage taken
away is a bit of a downfall here a few
changes from the iPhone 7 though this is
also a deviation from the Samsung Galaxy
s7 this phone comes with an IR blaster
so you can still control your TV
consuming you have like a TV that's
compatible with universal remotes you
can do that on your phone this also has
a volume rocker instead of dedicated
up-and-down volume buttons this is a bit
old-school here I'm not a huge fan of
this it just feels a bit cheap I'd
rather have dedicated up and down
buttons that's just me personally I'm
used to about this point I mean the s7
had them the iPhone 7 7 plus had them I
don't know why this doesn't happen the
last thing worth mentioning about this
phone the home button it resembles sort
of kind of an away the iPhone 7 home
button it also kind of resembles with
the samsung galaxy s7 s home button so
this is not a physical button you can't
push it in so that's kind of like the
iPhone 7 so that's not a physical button
either but instead of giving you that
fake button click this one just vibrates
that's that's all it does but it's super
quick check this out super quick it
recognizes your thumbprint right away
you don't need to click the home button
or anything will get to turn the screen
on all you got to do is just gently rest
your thumb over the home button and the
phone will turn on and unlock
for you it's extremely responsive and
it's recessed slightly into the phone's
body so you know exactly where you're
pressing every single time so what I
would rate this phone on a scale from
one to ten assuming price pros and cons
this is a solid eight point five out of
ten and I say that with confidence I say
that actually in a good light I think
that a be average is excellent for a
phone that's holding about four hundred
dollars this is probably the most
inexpensive flagship you can buy with
the exception of a few competitors that
you'll find on Amazon elsewhere the show
me me six is probably the least well
known brand here in the United States
that makes a really good smart phone
this would be my daily driver if only I
could use it with Verizon doesn't work
with Verizon I already tried that as
always you can find the product review
in this video this is a xiaomi me six
linked in this video's description be
sure to check it out let me know what
you think also leave a comment regarding
I don't know maybe a phone matchup this
versus something else that you think is
comparable for the price and for the
specs I would like to review other
phones on this channel so maybe this
will be a good start for that be sure to
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
this one be sure to give it a thumbs
down if you look a bit opposite and
