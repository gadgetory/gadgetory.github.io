iteration in the matrix family with its
own unique quirks and features so today
I'm going to review it building it
benchmarking it and then I'm gonna give
it a Greg score and four more of my
thoughts on the matrix Evan you can
visit autotrader.com slash / what ok so
this is definitely a strange case but it
somehow manages to impress me at the
same time especially given its price
you've got three panels of tempered
glass one acting as the left panel Chive
removed because the glare is like pretty
extreme another as the front panel here
and then the third is not the right
panel it's actually the basement roof
that's right this piece right here is a
tinted slab of tempered glass and boy
does it look good but is it functional
and are you paying more for this layout
we'll talk about all of that and more in
this video so to answer the first
question
no this class basement is not functional
really doesn't do anything other than
reflect light I mean it would look
really good if it scattered more light
than it actually does like the graphics
card light it'd look really nice if you
could see that kind of under glow on the
top of the basement but you don't really
get much of that and honestly if I had
the option of spending 10 or 20 more
dollars to have a glass basement
I would definitely turn that down
luckily this case is MSRP is $70 the
matrix 55 retails for around $55 and the
matrix 40 comes in it yeah 40 so you see
the trend fun fact this case here was
actually I believe the matrix 75 at
Computex last year so vehicles
effectively lowered the price since then
and the launch is actually gonna be I
think next week or the week after that
now a trade off to such an affordable
chassis given its dimensions and
features is fan inclusion you'll find
only a single 120 mil cheap voltage
controlled molex adapted fan to mess
around with and it honestly belongs in
the trash a good thing is you only have
one of these to deal with I mean come on
a fan with molex in 2019 yeah so throw
it away and that'll free up a bit of
your budget right having to pay only 70
bucks versus maybe 80 or 90 for some
okayish fans you can buy maybe nokju is
be quiets corsair fans we threw to 140
mm silent wings three fans in here
as well as a single 120 of the rare for
the sake of consistency in our
temperature tests which we will get to
shortly so first let's talk about
hardware support this case technically
can support up to e ATX thanks to its
flat motherboard tray and additional
standoffs toward the front this is a
nice touch and you'll still find
satisfactory cable management Headroom
behind this tray the case does lack
rubber grommets pretty much everywhere
which is a shame
I'd have taken that over the glass
basement I just think that the rubber
grommets are for more functional than
the glass basement is but what can you
do I mean I can complain about it this
is what we have to deal with so I know
that competition in the PC space is is
fierce especially in the case market I
just like the fact that some $70 cases
have rubber grommets and if they don't
have rubber grommets maybe they have
something else like a cable bar like
what NZXT does in this case you get none
of that it's just bare open holes for
routing cables and it just looks a
little ugly to be frank deep cool did
however take care of some other issues I
had going into this this review for one
the entire top of the case is devoted to
fans and radiators that is beautifully
give it up to three 120mm or 140mm fans
up here along with something as large as
a 360 ml a IO the mounting points are
positioned far enough to the left that
you shouldn't have any issues clearing
vrm heat sinks and cables that's nice
you can also mount the same config up
front though you'll find that there flow
is much better served above thanks to
the single dust filter that's this right
here the front of the case has a big old
piece of glass blocking any horizontal
flow pattern right so you're not gonna
have air just get pushed right in it's
gotta come in from these side vents and
these side vents are not wise it's not
coming out there we go the side vents
are not very porous let's say the grills
themselves do you have integrated dust
filters but deep coals included a second
cheap screen behind them I kind of
recommend just throwing this away I'm
not sure how they expect you to use this
when you have intake vents installed I
can't install it on the other side so
kind of weird there are a couple of
holes for routing cables through this
space including SATA cables for two SSDs
you could mount up front but I'd like to
see dedicated cutouts specifically for
fan cables otherwise it can get a bit
awkward trying to hide them
this is kind of exposed to a tempered
glass panel on the left side
speaking of cable routing space
elsewhere things are where you'd expect
them to be a glass basement provides a
large cutout for HD audio USB to front
i/o the works and large cutouts for the
24 pin USB 3 and SATA cables align the
right side of a standard ATX motherboard
by the way the front of this basement
includes one of the only signs of
branding you can see the name deep cool
here surrounded by semi-transparent
plastic lining which means you can
technically illuminate it if you place
an RGB strip back here it doesn't come
standard by default just a cost-saving
measure for deep cool but I should note
the fan text is a similar thing in there
P 350 X which mind you is very similar
in price to this so I would have liked
to have seen equal include the RGB strip
or some sort of LED or something down
here otherwise this is just like what
why make this semi-transparent if you're
not actually gonna put anything back
there I mean the option is nice but if
no one wants to buy it after the fact
it's just gonna look a little weird I'd
rather this have been like a mirror
finish or just like a slightly off black
color two less things I'd like to point
out on the side for one there are two
SSD mounts to the right of the
motherboard standoffs I'd mentioned
earlier obviously you can't use these if
you're sporting a ATX boards but there's
a nice inclusion just to consider I
don't want to gloss over that I only
wish that these cutouts were a bit
larger or even merged as I couldn't fit
my SATA power cable through the bottom
cutout and only an angled say the data
cable would fit through here so I ended
up rounding SATA power through the to
the top cut out excuse me instead of the
bottom one just a bit frustrating and
the other thing on this side no
dedicated cut out for PCIe power meaning
you'll likely have to run these cables
through the large opening toward the
rear of the basement which is why these
cables kind of stretch awkwardly way
over here I mean looks decent with like
a set of custom sleeve cables like these
but if you're just sporting your power
supply's cables it's not gonna look that
great and it's gonna have to stretch all
the way basically across your graphics
card shroud doesn't look too great now
onto the right side you'll find two
extra SSD trays behind the motherboard a
great use of space in my opinion you'll
also find a removable hard drive cage
good for two drives PSU space is
adequate anything under 200 millimeters
should fit without a hitch you do have
to load things in from the right
however so mind your PSU cables when
inserting the unit just a bit
frustrating again our straight power 11
fit almost perfectly so you could use
that as a reference if you still find
this installation tricky you can lay the
matrix seventy down on its side and
slide the hard drive cage about an inch
closer to the front the only downside
here is that you'll be partially
exposing the cage from behind the
basement so it'll look a little weird
kind of sticking out it'll also reduce
the amount of space available for a 360
ml fan rad combo if you decide to place
that up front for whatever reason rule
of thumb and just stick with a smaller
power supply and you'll be good to go
total clearance back here comes in at
around one inch or two and a half
centimeters or so this is satisfactory
but an extra centimeter would have been
nice you'll see however that right panel
installation makes things super simple
rowlock up even if you have a rat's nest
back here which is a good thing now I
save the exterior for later because a
lot of what we're gonna talk about with
respect to temperatures has to do with
this design and it's a questionable one
but it's not it's not terrible first of
all you'll find that it follows a
conventional mid-tower format right
seven PCIe slots at the rear a large
dust filter underneath a large list
filter up top standard front i/o
including two USB 3.0 ports a headphone
jack microphone jack and a dedicated
recess switch with a built-in LED
indicator for hard drives or solid state
drives whatever I like how clean it
looks up here and I like that everything
is relatively open for top fan support
and exhaust and what I don't like is
this front glass panel the mechanism for
removing it is pretty cool you get a
dedicated button right here you push it
and push that in and it just unlatches
the top of the this piece of glass from
the chassis and then to remove it
completely you have to kind of pull up
that's how its resting on the bottom
these two little brackets and then there
you go
the entire front panel is removed now
remember that other dust filter that
secondary one that was sitting I know
where these front fans are I remove that
again because there's an included mesh
kind of in these grills and I think
that's gonna do a good enough job
keeping dust out in fact I think that
the mesh in here is the exact same mesh
that they had also laying against the
fan tray so it's kind of redundant for
no reason
by the way all three panels are kind of
secured in a similar way so you just
slide them into their respective
positions
low and I'll kind of just hang there and
then you can secure it up top in the
case of the left right panel so you have
just two thumb screws to keep things in
place it's nice it eliminates the need
to secure all four and at the same time
you can kind of push especially with
that right panel you can just push it
into place which kind of pushes all the
cables against that motherboard tray
much easier than sliding the right panel
on from the rear
that was something I also liked about
the H 500 from NZXT so a brief synopsis
then great airflow qualities up top and
in my opinion terrible design up front I
just don't like the trend with like
having a solid panel especially if
you're not gonna do anything about it
most I like this is just the to me this
is not enough and I'd like to see more
if companies are gonna be bold enough to
completely block this off so anyway to
the temps now I switched to I 264 for
case temperature testing meaning I had
to rerun this exact config in the other
two cases we previously reviewed this
quarter which really sucked but you can
see here that the matrix 70 falls
somewhere in between our dark base 700
hotbox and the air AP 600 s from pantex
you can find links to both of those
reviews in the video description by the
way long story short this case chokes
for air intake but has absolutely no
problem exhausting it so in this config
we're probably running with slightly
negative internal pressure I will say
that deep cool saving grace in this case
was the top ventilation so if they had
completely sealed off this top section
we'd be looking at temperatures closer
to be quiets dark bass 700 whose CPU
temps grazed 84 degrees Celsius we only
saw a two degree Delta for the matrix 70
and literally no change in the graphics
card and to tip the scales and be quiet
saver at least a dark Bay 700 was a
quiet hot box with its sound damping
material this is not a silent case
obviously this is pretty much exposed to
the atmosphere so they're not you know
they're not advertising this is a quiet
case I have no problem with that just
know that going into the minute of the
purchase if you decide to buy this but I
still want to end on a high note I know
it seems like this case is just missing
a few important details but give who
actually managed to put together I think
it's a well-rounded case for under 100
USD and there's something to be said
about that
like sure it doesn't come with all the
fancy bells and whistles of the P 600 S
or the O 11 dynamic from Lee
but it does nearly all the jobs a case
should do at an affordable price point
in my opinion no I don't think the NZXT
H 500 or the fantex P 30x fall short of
this I think this case is slightly worse
than those two and those are both kind
of in the same price category that's
just me but you guys might hey you might
hate those cases you might really like
this one so again it's gonna be more or
less an opinion at that point
functionally I think those two cases are
better than this one but this is unique
right you get the glass basement I mean
like I said deep pools trying to
differentiate their brand from others by
doing some cool / weird things however
II want to look at this again it's not
really functional it's just an aesthetic
thing if you want to brag about having a
glass basement by all means oh and one
more thing a testament to the cable
management with this case in the right
panel this was my first attempt to
install the right panel and it went very
smoothly so I'm very impressed again the
matric 70 of the log going for it the
case launches in early April you'll
still be able to find it on sites like
Newegg and Amazon shortly I'll be sure
to link those as soon as they pop up for
now I've linked the product page along
with other cases similar price points
including those from NZXT and fantex if
