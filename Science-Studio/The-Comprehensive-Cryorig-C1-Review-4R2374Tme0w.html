and I've got to admit they make some
pretty cool looking coolers me yeah I
went there it's always pleasing to come
across a company that values both
functionality and beauty and in the case
of the cry or exceed one no exception
was made a first glance of the see ones
box gives the impression that a fairly
large cooler lay inside the top pack
contains every piece of mounting
hardware required by LGA 775 1150 X 2011
v3 FM - plus a + 3 + you get the point
the pack underneath houses both the
cooler and slim 140 millimeter fan the
fan itself is black in color comprised
of 13 blades and it's capable of
rotating anywhere from 700 to 1300 times
per minute you're welcome to replace
this one with any 140 millimeter unit
but I can't really imagine why you'd
want to at only 13 millimeters thick
it's sure to be the best fan for the job
the cooler is much larger than I
expected it to be although its form
factor is mini ITX friendly it's run it
by a large white bezel which I find to
be very classy and is accompanied on one
side by six massive six millimeter
nickel plated copper heat pipes which
proved to be excellent dissipators of
heat after all that kind of is the point
here cryo rigs iconic logo resides on
the opposite face and that's essentially
it the cooler is sturdy weighs more than
you think it would just over half a
kilogram and is interlaced with several
fins the more the better to an extent
the fan is PWM controlled allowing for
optimal manual settings pwm by the way
stands for pulse width modulation just
to satisfy your curiosity they're
generally preferable over three pin
voltage regulated fans of lesser great
you can also type the sleeve fan cable
into rubber retentions along the four
corners of the frame depending on where
you decide to route it the clips are a
bit difficult to risa cure something I
do wish crab I could thought through a
little more but that's just kind of me
being picky the installation packet was
a straight up carnival of mounting
screws and back plates they're also
given a large tube of thermal paste with
the c1 I still recommend Arctic silver 5
for now but this will definitely get the
job done especially if you have nothing
else on hand
nice inclusion nonetheless a bunch of
fan and bracket screws caps and
something else unexpected a large
Phillips head screwdriver looky there
grad we included it for the sake of
mounting the cool
which you'll see shortly and I'm glad
they did it's a nice inclusion to any
toolkit regardless even if you don't
decide to use this thing I mean come on
free tools right free tools I'll be
mounting to see one of my brother's old
rigs sporting an FX 6300 which means
that we'll be needing this backplate
suitable for a m3 and FM 2 motherboards
and just like the stock plate this one's
made of metal not plastic for the record
the Intel plate was as well it's nice to
see even expensive water coolers include
plastic back plates so when I stuck here
here's a representation of just how
large the cravaack c1 is yeah that's the
stock AMD cooler right next to it night
and day difference in terms of both
sound and performance by the way don't
mount the fan until after you've mounted
the cooler you'll see why here in a
second
cravaack includes quite a number of
special accessories that make this
cooler appear premium and when you have
a look at the price
you can't really blame them for trying I
mean come on an alcohol pad I guess so I
mean we'll put it to use in this video
but I can't really see I guess I guess
it doesn't hurt to have it I will say
that the manual is very detailed and
easy to follow I'm glad I opened it
there are several screw packets to sort
through here you can also download the
manual from their website linked in this
video's description so let's get to it
then this one is for AMD but Intel
shouldn't be too difficult to follow
either after all you do have that
excellent manual start by removing the
plastic pieces up front we won't need
these but save them just in case you can
also store the old metal backplate
Craiova includes their own use the thumb
screws lined with rubber pads on their
bottoms to secure the new backplate
being careful not to over-tighten
they're called thumb screws for reason
folks insert the front plate and use the
short stubby screws to lock it into
place one on each corner again don't
over tighten these no Phillips
screwdriver is required if your CPU as
an old thermal paste pre applied you can
remove it with the included isopropyl
alcohol pad I guess I'll use it here but
be careful it is runny and fairly thin
only 70% - I recommend 90 or higher
after ensuring that the CPU heat
spreader is dry you may remove the
plastic cover covering the nickel-plated
base look how nice and shiny that thing
is play a fresh line of thermal paste
and align the two spring-loaded screws
on the cooler which you can see here
from the top see why we shouldn't have
installed the fan in the first place
with the holes on the front plate sorry
that was a lot of a lot of interjections
in one sentence this took some time and
four hands the c1 was super stubborn and
without help from my brother
we could have properly secured it there
was plenty of clearance over the Crucial
Ballistix sport ram on board but we
found that it was much easier to mount
vertically I don't really know why I
can't really explain it but regardless
the fan will be pointing downwards sure
to cool off voltage regulator modules
and the CPU itself once the cooler is
mounted screw in the 140 millimeter fan
of your choice again I see nothing wrong
with using the low profile cryo rig fan
it's quiet efficient and low profile
important especially for those tightly
packed ITX builds after plugging in the
fan power cable this can be tricky if
you didn't already plug it in before you
secure the cooler take a few seconds to
admire the cryovac c1 it's honestly one
of my favorite coolers hands down thanks
not only to its unique orientation but
it's minimalistic functional design my
brother was very happy he received a CPU
cooler upgrade trust me it was much
needed no more jet engine sounds and we
were both satisfied with the new look
the c1 offered plenty of clearance
underneath
even when oriented upward and honestly
looks just it just looks good this one's
sure to compliment any rig and hold its
own against even the toughest of
overclocks speaking of which what are
the temperatures like well off the bat
idles noticeably improved when just
sitting there looking pretty
temperatures were in the mid 20s roughly
10 degrees lower than with the stock
cooler keep in mind this is with an AMD
FX 6300 and surprise-surprise
overclocked to 4.4 gigahertz the
differences were just as stark while the
stock cooler brought the FX 6300 to 76
degrees Celsius and a degree of thermal
throttling at that the c1 performed as
expected pushing temperatures down into
the low 60s safe operating temperatures
for piledriver CPUs so at this point all
is well right I should just end the
video here well I would the c1 is
undoubtedly a great cooler but one thing
has me hung up here the price at a
little over 60 US dollars currently it's
certainly no bargain and I'm sure many
of you are wondering how well the hyper
212 Evo stacks up probably the most
popular air cooler around thanks to its
effectiveness and low price to be honest
I was a bit disappointed don't get me
wrong you can't get much better than the
c1 when it comes to thermal maintenance
but it's sixty US dollars it makes me
cringe come on cry reg this one was a
review sample that they sent me but I am
willing to admit that I would not use my
own personal money to purchase this
cooler at this price if it creeps into
the $40 range though I personally
guarantee you cry rig you'll have the
competitive
advantage you're looking for you can
find a link to the cry wixi one in this
video's description like I said love the
cooler just don't love the price
this is science to do thanks for
learning with us
