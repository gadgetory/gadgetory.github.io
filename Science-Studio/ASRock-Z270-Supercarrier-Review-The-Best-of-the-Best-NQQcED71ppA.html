comes with one of these built-in
carrying handles meet the asrock Z 270
super carrier the name is a bit strange
but I told asrock that I would make a
video dedicated just to this motherboard
because it's beautiful and it comes
packed with features that I think you'll
be very interested to hear about look
you know a company's confident looks at
their board we may include a physical
door on the box itself but if you look
right into the box to see the
motherboard check out that beautiful
silver sleek design aesthetically
speaking it's one of the best-looking
motherboards on the market I don't even
think that's up for debate there's a
prominent number 27 over the chipset
heatsink followed by the company logo
just below the CPU socket the entire
board also lights up with integrated
LEDs and is compatible with Aurra from a
suit you'll also find four full-length
steel reinforced PCIe slots more on that
in a second as well as a large heat pipe
that spans the center of the board
most motherboards do include a few extra
items usually SATA cables maybe an SLI
bridge or something of that sort but it
feels like there's much more in this box
than just the board itself let's find
out what else is in here this is one of
the strangest as the library's I've ever
seen this is a 4 Way NVIDIA GTX at the
library of course you got your backplate
SATA cables more SATA cables to Wi-Fi
and 10 a another estimate another sli
bridge another sli bridge and another
sli bridge if this one's flexible you'll
also find the usual paperwork a software
installation guide user manual whatever
this is a postcard
I think included a postcard in a
motherboard box and then your driver
installation CD so what I'm getting from
this board is that pretty much anything
you can think that should be packed into
any z170 or z2 70 motherboard is on this
board I mean there's everything from
doctor debug to dedicated reset and
power switches you get a dedicated USB a
physical USB type a port of top USB 3.0
type a your 24 pin your 8 pin over here
and then all your other goodies down
below to dedicated USB 2.0 hubs HD audio
plenty of SATA micro SATA and also a
separate
connection for additional power to be
supplied to any extra graphics cards you
may squeeze onto the board
you'll also find two USB 3.0 hubs on the
board not sure what case would take
advantage of that but you have it if you
need it on the left side of the board a
large silver sheen drear i/o panel spans
the entire length from top to bottom
you'll find purity sound floor which is
as rocks take on the realtek driver if
you're dedicated sound chipset is
underneath here kind of isolated from
the rest of the system which is good to
see it keeps the static out of your
audio basically what that does the
larger part of the rear panel really
serves no functional purpose that's how
it is with most boards there's no
built-in fan or anything like that there
is a single led house here which is RGB
capable so you can turn that to whatever
color you want there's also a logo for
Gigabit Ethernet kind of wish they had
taken that off and replace that with
just like their ass rocker logo so I
don't like how they just kind of like
pop a single feature of the board onto
the rear panels being that you'll be
seeing this in your case it's not the
coolest quality but as for rear i/o
ports I'm going to run down the list
here two USB 2.0 ports a DisplayPort
tool an rj45 ports a five Gigabit LAN
port that's pretty awesome full-on 7.1
surround sound with optical support
you'll find two USB 3.0 ports two USB
3.1 type-a ports and then two
Thunderbolt three USB type-c ports so
Thunderbolt 3 capability built into this
motherboard here you'll also find a
dedicated HDMI port CMOS reset switch
and good old ps2 mouse and keyboard
support so as you can probably tell by
this point this motherboard makes no
compromises whatsoever
it even comes with a dedicated Wi-Fi
card 4 Way SLI and crossfire are both
supported without a doubt on this board
you're not gonna have a problem running
for any card even though that would be a
bit unrealistic nonetheless the board
does support it as well as for ddr4 dims
capable of up to 37 33 megahertz and up
and that's something that as Rock was
very confident about going into this but
ok let's talk about for what this board
was really intended it comes with a 14
phase power delivery system which in and
of itself should speak volumes about as
rocks intent with overclock ability on
this
14 phases is a metric crap-ton some of
the best overclocking motherboards I've
ever owned come with a maximum of 12
granted you might not notice you know a
very clear evident difference between 12
and 14 what it really means is that the
power delivery to your CPU will be very
very stable it's very very redundant
which is a good thing as rocks spared no
expense in that department
but on top of that I'm reading straight
from the box here as rocks also included
an external base clock generator which
provides a wider range of frequencies
and more precise clock waveforms so what
this means is if you want to push your
CPU to its limit let's say you have an
i7 7700 K and you want to reach 5
gigahertz you want to hit that 5 gig
threshold you might not only have to
tweak your multiplier and your V core
which are the two pretty much basic
variables involved overclocking more on
that right here kind of an old video but
it just still stands but you might also
have to tweak your base clock most
motherboards include two base
frequencies 800 megahertz and 1,000
megahertz that frequency multiplied by
your multiplier hence its name yields
your CPU frequency your base clock also
affects your DRAM frequency by the way
so when you tweak your base clock
remember to double check those ddr4
settings but with a wider range of
frequencies being generated by this
board you can be a bit more specific
with your overclocking settings case in
point I was ever get this I 373 50k to
4.9 gigahertz without a hitch and that
was on air mind you not only does this
speak volumes about how well the CPU is
binned but also about how capable the
motherboard is at delivering power to
the CPU and in a stable manner so if you
don't have enough voltage being applied
to the CPU at a certain frequency or if
that voltage is being applied in a
variable kind of state it's not a steady
flow of voltage it's kind of more
impulses which is not good for a CPU
then you'll get something like this a
blue screen of death I've had my fair
share of those and they're kind of
impossible to avoid if you're looking to
push the boundary of what your CPU can
do so if you if you're trying to find
the highest possible frequency the
lowest possible v core chances are
you're going into a few blue screens of
death good thing the board's got a clear
CMOS button on there and you've also got
a few other things to help you along the
way
doctor debug is also a very nice
addition I like seeing boards with
doctor debug makes diagnosis very simple
I think
looks gorgeous it has some insane
overclocking potential I think it has
the best of everything if you're looking
for some of the most extreme overclocks
and you're also kind of picky in the
looks department which I understand I am
as well this board is for you and though
I wasn't paid to say anything in this
video I could have just trashed it and
you know then fine I'm sure as rock
would have questioned my judgment but
now I can say with certainty this is one
of the best lea 270 boards ever and it
likely will remain that way I dare I
dare other motherboard manufacturers to
try to beat this if you like this video
be sure to give it a thumbs up give it a
thumbs down if you feel the complete
obviously be sure to click Subscribe but
if you haven't already find this
motherboard in the video's description
