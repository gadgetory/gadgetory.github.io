interpret motion as specific rate this
motion however is not bound by a frame
rate and it would be improper to
describe the human eye as a sort of
camera which can perceive motion in
terms of 30 or 60 fps that's just not
how our eyes work rather our eyes
constantly perceive object motion as it
happens which is why objects moving at
very high velocities don't appear choppy
what our brain does do however is
incorporate a great deal of motion blur
into the moving image motion blur is the
effect that results from an object being
in motion during the time at which a
single exposure takes place but hold on
gray you just use the word exposure
exposure is a photography term so why
are we using that word to describe our
eyes if our eyes are not cameras it's a
tricky subject to explain Michael
Stevens from vsauce already explained
some one of his videos I'll go ahead and
let him take it from here very good
question what frame rate do we see the
world in with our eyeballs I mean how
fast is information travel from our eye
to our brain now here's what we do know
the visual cortex in our brain usually
holds that information from our retina
for about a fifteenth of a second so if
an animation moves at 15 frames a second
or faster it's gonna look nice and fluid
but if it's lower than 15 frames a
second our brains not fooled by the beta
movement and it'll look like it's
skipping so basically the faster the
frame rate the better everything's going
to look in the end something definitely
worth noting is the fact that continuous
motion as displayed via the mediums of
TVs and monitors at around 100 frames
per second and above are typically more
difficult to discern from one another
than their lower frame rate counterparts
another clear truth in this matter is
the fact that as the frame rate of any
video increases the ability for the
human eye to distinguish individual
frames diminishes drastically past
around 100 Hertz and yes while the well
trained eye can easily spot the
difference between 120 144 Hertz it can
more easily distinguish say 30 Hertz
from 60 this indicates a law of
diminishing returns when it comes to
monitor frame rates and the rates at
which chemical reactions take place
within the occipital lobe of the human
brain it's also easier to see singular
non continuous abrupt changes in
individual images let me show you what I
mean by that there this black screen and
make a mental note of what color you see
when it pops up in the center got it now
make a note of this color did you see
both the colors you should have seen
where red and green if you saw both
congratulations your I was able to
perceive individual images as they
appeared for only one sixtieth of a
second on a black screen so there we
have finite proof that Hume and I can at
least distinguish 60 individual frames
per second right well let's try another
experiment tell me what color you see
now did you see it was the color yellow
congratulations you were incorrect the
colors you should have seen were again
red and green in that order and each
appeared again for only one sixtieth of
one second
so what's going on here did we just
confirm that the human eye could
distinguish individual frames that exist
for only 17 milliseconds well yes but
only under the condition that the frame
change was abrupt and non continuous you
see when you're playing a video game on
a monitor with a refresh rate of 144
hurt and assuming a full 144 frames are
being sent to the monitor per second you
were actually seeing and perceiving a
full 144 frames per second there is no
denying that however when the change is
between each individual frame our subtle
for instance when your character is
walking around in an open world or when
you're panning over an entire city those
individual frames are less easily
perceived in the case of fast-moving
high intensity scenarios as in the case
of csgo those individual frames are
crucial because viewpoints and character
movements are constantly changing and
fast paces it's why the individual
flashes of both red and green were very
easy to perceive but also why the quick
transition from red to green resulted in
a mix or blend of both colors resulting
in the yellow this is indicative of
those fast view changes quick pivots and
sharp character movements in csgo and
other first-person shooters in
particular which is why higher refresh
rates are generally more desirable in
those kinds of games in the latter
scenario both the shape and duration of
each color shown was identical so the
abrupt change resulted in a blend and
thus a lower perceived framerate 30fps
over 60 the United States Air Force also
conducted a response time test on their
pilots what they did was have their
pilot stare at a blank screen and then
momentarily flash an image of a plane on
to the screen they found that some of
their pilots could identify even the
make and model of the plane shown even
though it was only shown for one two
hundred and twentieth of a second now
while this test does
the human eye can distinguish individual
frames at rates much higher than sixty
Hertz it does not indicate how many
successful frames the pilots could see
back-to-back so for example if the plane
was shown moving across the screen
entirely in one second at a frame rate
of 220 frames per second the pilot
wouldn't be able to perceive and
translate every single frame it's simply
too much information for the brain to
process in fact the moving image of the
plane would likely give the pilot a
headache as Michael Stevens explains
here's the thing if frame rates get
higher and higher you wind up with an
image that can actually cause headaches
when people watch it on the screen so
back to the point about our eyes
tracking onto objects if I do this move
my hand in front of my face and track it
with my eyes I can see my hand it makes
sense but a certain point my handle
moves so fast that it's just a blur and
the reason it's a blur is because my eye
can only track so fast and when objects
move faster than our eyeballs can track
your brain adds in motion blur that way
we get a sense of movement happening but
we don't see something like a hand
randomly appearing all over the place so
it's literally too much visual
information for our brains to transpose
without incorporating motion blur which
is our brains way of relieving visual
stress racing games in particular are
notorious for incorporating artificial
motion blur for this very reason
when enjoying a racing game it's a 100
frames per second the car the center of
your screen your car remains rather
stationary with the exception of a few
turns slides and hills everything else
however it moves a very very fast pace
especially near the edges of your screen
if these moving images were shown
without motion blur you'd likely develop
an intense headache with time especially
if you're not used to such quick
movements this would occur because
you're forcing your brain to convert 100
stills essentially into a conscious
moving picture whereas in the real world
your brain would most certainly resort
to motion blur to alleviate the
potential stress involved with the
visual translation all in this video
with one final trivial notion we've
already concluded that the human eye is
not a camera and therefore cannot be
measured in terms of frame rates or even
pixels however the next time you're
riding shotgun with a buddy on a highway
have a glance at a passing cars rims
individual spokes rotating hundreds of
times per second eventually become all
jumbled up by our brain resulting in the
illusion of no
we'll spend whatsoever it's difficult to
see at times and the car in question has
to be moving at certain speed but when
the conditions are right it will appear
as though the car is simply gliding over
the road without his tires rotating at
all we can limit this exact phenomena
via a camera by tiny exposure
specifically to when the next spoke of
each rim or the next blade of each rotor
moves into the same position that the
previous spoke or blade was the frame
before
so if camera see it this way and the
human eye sees it this way can we still
say that the humanized perception of
reality is entirely separate from that
of a cameras food for thought
what is real how do you define real if
you're talking about what you can feel
but you can smell you can taste and see
then real is simply electrical signals
interpreted by your brain so the next
time you find yourself shopping for
computer monitor ask yourself a
following question what kind of games
will I play if your number one answer
was first-person shooters off for the
monitor with the highest refresh rate
possible and sure to pair it with a
graphics card that's beefy enough to
output that many frames per second if
that's a little confusing check out the
card above me other than that be sure to
