risin fives benchmark so how about a
change of pace for the end of today I
built a custom loop inside the NZXT s340
elite and yes it was as hard as it
sounds there were a few compromises I
had to make right off the bat most
obviously those being the pump mounted
on top of the basement rather than
inside the basement where it typically
goes most of the time you don't want to
show off the pump it's just not a very
aesthetically pleasing feature of a
custom loop but being that the s340
elites are rather stubborn on modular
case in that sense I can't just remove
the hard drive tray underneath it's
actually bolted to the basement I'd have
to drill through it if I wanted to
remove it which I wasn't willing to do
because I don't want to mess up this
case and I've never done that before I
just decided to put it on top of the
basement it actually fits perfectly in
the SSD tray on top it's like it was
designed for that so I did my best to
make it look like it was a part of the
aesthetic side of the custom loop even
though obviously if I could do it all
over again
I would try to find another way to hide
that underneath it just wasn't much
space between the power supply bebe
quiet 1000 watt power supply got
underneath and the hard drive tray there
just wasn't enough room for a pump down
there now the other compromise I you
know what listen I can say compromise
let's say unorthodox methodology I had
to wrap the 24 pin around the cable
shroud of the SD Foley which is
definitely weird most people just kind
of stuff it underneath the original
opening on the left side closer to the
motherboard but I wanted to show off
these cables I didn't want a more
cramped up and that's one of the issues
I had with the s340 elite that I
explained in this video right here but
Tony made these cables the 24 pin the 8
pin as well as the 8 pin DPS up top
which you can't really see but it's
still nice to know that it's there he
has a third-party vendor that he be
happy to share with you can follow him
on Facebook on Twitter on Instagram he's
got all the same social media accounts
that I do and he also has a YouTube
account which I encourage you to
subscribe to it's linked in the video
description but he makes all this stuff
by hand he was more than happy to help
me out here I really do appreciate it I
think it makes the build pop it would
look the same without them the red and
white accents of the cables definitely
matched the case as well as the red
fluid which is where will come next I
chose red fluid I use the C 1000 per
clear which is thermal takes C 1000
opaque clear counterpart remember I had
issues with the opaque coolant before
but I decide to go with a clear stuff
this time haven't had a problem
yet I also used the Thermaltake red dye
and I'm still doing just fine so we'll
see how that goes pretty much everything
in here that pertains to the custom loop
by the way is sponsored by thermaltake
actually recycled much of this from the
Rison custom lube bill but you can check
out right here the specs of this build
are linked in the video description I
760 700 K just a gtx 1070 for now
although I will be doing something very
special with a 1080 TI here soon but I
just wanted another challenge I was
frankly challenged by Edie from Texas
who but like talking a little smack
about my original blueSky build also
didn't find my rise in custom loop build
too enticing although I mean I built two
in the same time that it took him to
build well a fourth of one and so I
decided to slap him in the face with
this third custom new build which took
me only a day and a half to put together
I didn't film the build process because
I wanted to focus solely on the custom
loop there were a few bends in here that
were very tricky you're looking at this
bend right here from the GP to the CPU
completely unnecessary but what I call
the you bend
that's for you ed from tech source and
this either been right here it's kind of
like a corkscrew it goes up from the CPU
to the 120 rad mounted in the back I
think both of these bends were just just
necessary for the build to look
excellent for the build to look
different not just I don't ordinary and
of course from the 120 the loop flows
into the top mounted reservoir which I
will admit I was a little uneasy about
that's a lot of weight a lot of fluid up
top it's only being suspended by a
couple of pipes and it's also slightly
hanging on to the top of the 240 rod in
the front of the case it is fairly
stable it will wiggle back and forth if
you really force it but as long as your
fittings just you could properly
shouldn't have any leaks now by this
point you might be wondering why on
earth my front mounted rad is upside
down
typically the pipes funnel in from the
top right well in this case because the
reservoir is where it is on the top of
the case
there was no other way to make this work
so I had to have the pipe from the
reservoir feed down into the intake at
the bottom where the rat is turned
upside down and then have that fluid
feed into the pump on top of the
basement typically you want your
reservoir to feed your pump directly
that way when you cycle through and get
that fluid moving you don't have air
that's trapped
somewhere usually it's trapped at the
bottom or if you can't get your fluid
down from the reservoir initially you
can't really cycle your fluid because
you have nothing to food there you don't
want to turn on your pump when there is
no fluid there the pump will just spin
way faster than it should heat up
usually kill the pump after a few
minutes or so so don't do that make sure
that you rotate the case a few times
especially in a scenario like this where
the res is not the reservoir is not
feeding the pump directly so that was
another compromise I had to make it it
mentioned that earlier but I figured by
this point we're talking about the
custom loop you can kind of see why I
did that and from the pump a couple of
90 degree fittings lead directly into
the gtx 1070 and this is a thermal take
gtx 1070 1080 reference PCB block I did
have to remove the thermal take back
plate though and fit the Alpha Coulomb
which is also a bit weird because these
are competing manufacturers when it
comes to custom cooling here nonetheless
it wouldn't fit the the thermal take one
with the asrock supercarriers g27 your
motherboard which I'm using in the build
you can check out that review right here
but the rear i/o shield is just a little
too thick and I couldn't fit that
backplate underneath that i/o shield the
thermal take one so I swapped it for the
Alpha Coulomb which is very thin at the
rear where that IO shield is and I think
it looks ok you can't really tell that
it's a thermal take block anyway unless
you look at it from the bottom and even
then it kind of looks like a lot of
other blocks out there if you're
wondering what kind of Ram I have in the
build this is Galax Hall of Fame ddr4
clocked at 3000 megahertz it's difficult
to get your hands on I will admit but if
you can do it because these dims look
spectacular I've had them for a few
months not actually use them in a very
old bill which I don't blame me for not
knowing about but I think in this case
it looks great with the white case as
well as the white accents in the cables
I've stuck a couple of silent wings
three fans from be quiet at the front in
front of the 240 rad and a single LED
white deep cool I don't know what it's
called specifically but it's a fluid
bearing fan from the game or storm
series it's what you would get if you
bought a 240 or 120 mil captain EXO
that's where I took that band from if
you're wondering a few people have asked
about that in previous builds but that
is what that is it's not as quiet as the
the silent wings three fans in the front
not anywhere near as quiet but with a
few tweaks to your fan curve and your
BIOS you should be okay now the icing on
the cake in my book for this build is
the Pnyx eller 8 SSD this is 960
gigabyte SSD it's the only drive in the
system of course of my operating system
wanted all of my games that I benchmark
with as well as Adobe Premiere and my
footage it's plenty one terabyte is
plenty for all that I personally do and
the red and the dark kind of grey black
accents really do match everything else
in the bill especially the motherboard
and the red accents in the cables along
with the red fluid so that's it this is
my third build ever let me know what you
think about the Ben's particular what
you would do differently if you could
build this I understand everyone has
different preferences you know this is
my PC so I built its way that I want but
if you could build your own PC and have
the same parts what would you do
differently let me know if you are
interested in maybe some kind of
experiment where we drill through the
case and try to mount the pump
underneath the basement get rid of that
harddrive tray which I'm not using by
the way I recommend that we could
probably get that done I would say
within the next few weeks or so so we
might reconstruct this loop if we can
fit the pump underneath that's the only
thing I would personally change about it
it just takes a lot of work you got to
drill through and it's a good case the
way it is and I don't think it looks
that bad if you liked the video be sure
to give it a thumbs up thumbs down for
the opposite click subscribe on if you
haven't already I will catch you in the
next video finals week is coming up I'm
going to be very busy with stuff other
than YouTube so be patient with me
this is Salazar studio thanks for
