hit the PC market with a price tag of 59
99 US dollars but this really comes as
no surprise as most triple-a titles are
released at this price point even for
consoles but what if I told you you
could pick up a multiplayer version of
the exact same game for fifteen dollars
would you consider it first and foremost
don't think of this multiplayer version
as a trial or a demo of sorts this is
the full fledged multiplayer black ops 3
experience with in my opinion very few
limitations you can game online with
friends customized weapons access
special perks hosts massive free-for-all
killing sprees and even the smallest
maps if you're into that and even ranked
up to a point you see there are a few
drawbacks to this approach 15 bucks is a
stellar deal especially if all you do is
play online but if you were hoping to
mix in some zombies or campaign gameplay
you'll be disappointed the multiplayer
version of the game only gives access to
you guessed it the multiplayer
experience zombies campaign and custom
multiplayer gameplay which I frankly
never use are in a sense deactivated you
also cannot prestige now I understand
that this alone might be a deal-breaker
for some of you but consider the fact
that you're only paying one fourth of
the total retail price to play online
now what did I mean when I said that the
other features of black ops 3 were
deactivated you'll find that if you
decide to purchase just the multiplayer
experience the entire game will actually
download yes all 25 or so gigs of it
this is so that should you decide to
upgrade their after you won't have to
download the rest of the game from
scratch in fact upgrading as literally
as easy as paying the difference so the
total price of the game minus the 15
that you already paid and then being
able to immediately thereafter access
the rest of the game it's actually a
pretty cool idea and implementation I
also have to give credit to treyarch and
Activision for being so explicit as to
what you're paying for with the
multiplayer subscription there were no
surprises when I purchased just the
multiplayer experience and was very
satisfied with the end result though I
wasn't necessarily satisfied with being
absolutely
related in gameplay itself I'm still
learning to be fair there is another
game you could pick up for about five
dollars more than the multiplayer
version of black ops 3 at this point in
time it's also a first-person shooter
but it will give you the full gaming
experience not just a limited
multiplayer experience that game is
battlefield 4 if you're a fan of the
battlefield experience then you should
just consider that only I wouldn't even
look at black ops 3 multiplayer in this
case but if you're into the call of duty
experience you think that's like the
coolest thing ever then I suggest that
you take a look at least at this call of
duty black ops 3 multiplayer experience
I think it's definitely worth the
fifteen dollars that i paid for it i
enjoy the experience from the get-go
it's just like the classic call of duty
games on the consoles that i used to
play back in the day so give it a shot
if you decide you like it maybe you can
buy the full full fledged game later on
if you're into paying forty fifty sixty
dollars for it at this point fifteen
dollars will be just fine for myself be
sure to let me know in the comments
below especially if you've played black
ops 3 on either of the console or the pc
don't comment if you haven't played
that's just not cool if you think that
the fifteen dollars is worth only the
multiplayer experience i'd like to hear
from others other than just myself
because i don't really play these kinds
of games much anymore so fifteen dollars
might be good to some I not be good to
others I'd like to hear from you I'd
also like to give an epic shout out to
our techie of the week h3h3 productions
who in turn wanted me to give his
shout-out to bits dinkleberg do ya also
be sure to LIKE the video if you liked
the video dislike the video if you
disliked it for whatever reason maybe
you just don't like black ops 3 i'll
take that out on may come on now be sure
to stay tuned for an i7
one-thousand-dollar US dollar rig that i
will be building next week as well as a
very cheap htpc bill that will be coming
I guess right behind it right before I
haven't decided which I'm gonna go first
but I stay tuned for both of those
things and subscribe if you haven't
already so you can check out those cool
builds and other things on our Channel
this is science to do thanks for
