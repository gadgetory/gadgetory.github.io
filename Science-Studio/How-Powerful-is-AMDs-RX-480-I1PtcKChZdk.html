for the first Polaris GPU to hit the
markets but the big question is in light
of both the 1070 and 1080 releases how
much traction will this mid to your
graphics card have let's find out let's
run through the specifications of the
card and we'll assess performance as we
go along perhaps the most noteworthy
improvement of the 480 is in its
architecture we are so excited at the 40
nanometer of graphene for transition
right because it brings much higher
performance at much lower power which is
always really really sweet thing for for
gamers for workstation for VR and all
these incredible use cases we're talking
40 nanometer FinFET transistor design a
substantial jump from the 28 nanometer
architecture of AMD's GC and 1.2
technology both the r9 380 and 390
utilize this process we'll be using both
of these cards to compare with the RX
480
the 480 will most certainly feature 2300
for stream processors roughly equivalent
to CUDA cores on a video side placing it
directly between the r9 380 and 390
totals this number is calculated by
multiplying the number of compute units
by the number of stream processors per
compute unit which has been 64
throughout the existence of GCN while
this number for the 480 might seem a bit
underwhelming it's important to take
into consideration the affirm engine
architectures involved with these chips
as having smaller transistors allows for
a much larger amount of them to be
packed into a similarly sized die the
standard we can use to estimate graphics
card performance without using in-game
benchmarks is floating-point performance
calculated in teraflops this is
essentially the IPC of a GPU in the case
of the RX for 80 AMD's chosen to keep
this number basically a secret so what's
inside on our X 480 we have over 500
flops of computing in this beautiful
card however what we can do is produce a
very close estimate to the actual number
that we'll see later this month by using
the r9 390 and 380 as references taking
into account the 50% reduction in
transistor size a TDP of 150 watts half
the TDP of the r9 390 and teraflop
values of 5.1 and 3.5 respectively we
can safely assume that the arcs for
will likely fall above the 5.1 teraflop
performance of the 390 and what do you
know this falls in line with AMD's claim
and beyond the specification it is also
our most power efficient GPU ever it's
up to 2.8 x performance for what
improvement or art regeneration it's
enabled by both the FinFET technology
that we work with and also architectural
improvements amazing amazing performance
improvement in fact in my personal
opinion based on the efficiency factor
in stream processor count of the card
the RX 480 will likely meet or exceed
the rating of the r9 390x at 5.9
teraflops in terms of memory we're
looking at eight gigabit per second
gddr5 which is actually quite high for
g5 memory and a 256-bit memory bus
memory size will likely vary some cards
will offer four gigabytes of vram and
others eight gigabytes it's highly
probable that the base reference card
will only offer four gigabytes and
you'll have to pay a premium of sorts
for the eight gigabyte version we are
slowly becoming mainstream and AMD is
not backing down so we wanted to deliver
a high-performance low-cost low-power
solution to democratize vr which can
make we are possible for anyone who
wants it it can drive VR into detail it
can hit system price points PC price
points that can be everywhere in retail
and it can grow the market to over 100
million consumers and also drive VR
application development content
development in a large-scale fashion
they're claiming $500 VR performance
from the RX 480 which is a bold claim
and it would actually put it in the same
category as an R 9 nano I remain
skeptical of this claim just as I did
for invidious claim of the 10 70s VR
performance and just performance in
general I don't really take what
companies say about their own cards at
face value and I honestly don't believe
that you should either I invite you to
check out our reviews of these cards
once they're released before formulating
adamant opinions on any of these cards
pre-debut finally price how much will
this budget powerhouse cost
well according to AMD only 199 bucks so
about the same price as
current r9 380 for you go by graphics
card however it does appear that the rx
for you will perform about 50 percent
better than its 380 counterpart making
it quite the bargain for the red team so
that brings the conclusion my Polaris
unreal today and latest architecture is
a giant giant step forward for PC gaming
and VR and what we have revealed to you
today is its capability in in VR and
it's and its price points you will see a
lot more information about the entire
Polaris GPU stack coming out in the neck
over the next few weeks ladies and
gentlemen thank you and also I want to
thank all of the engineers who worked on
Polaris tirelessly over the last two
years to get us to this day thank you
expect to hear more from Andy in the
coming weeks and stay tuned for the
release of the RX 480

believe this will be our 13th we're on a
roll folks this is science studio thanks
for learning with us
