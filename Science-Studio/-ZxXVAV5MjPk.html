many people on this platform in
different ways now there are many people
who are relying on Google Adsense
revenue as their sole source of income
okay Adsense is what Google uses to
source ads and then pay you out based on
how many people view those ads that are
planted in your YouTube videos I use
that sense pretty much every other tech
tuber on YouTube uses Adsense most
youtubers use Adsense if they are
seeking some source of revenue stream
from YouTube they're using Adsense but
Adsense is the issue here the issue here
is actually the artificial intelligence
that is governing the monetization
status of videos uploaded to the
platform now whether someone is relying
solely on Google Adsense revenue as
their source of income or just using the
money to spend extra on the weekends is
beside the point it doesn't matter if
you're being affected totally by this or
barely by this the fact is it should not
be happening at all YouTube's the
monetization structure is broken now
will and I have been trying to figure
this out for weeks what exactly is
setting off the algorithm is it may be a
misinterpretation of auto closed
captioning within YouTube is it some
word in the video description is it
maybe a tag in the video it can be any
or all of those things and that's what's
so confusing because some videos that
have nothing to do with any suggestive
content at all including most of what we
cover here on this channel is being
demonetised
my good friend Steve over a hardware
unboxed has had several of his videos to
monetize for literally no reason I've
watched every single one of those videos
from beginning to end and there's not a
single word that I find should be
tripping that de monetization in fact
one of our own build videos in the NZXT
H 700 I was demonetized for about three
days which meant that we literally made
nothing during that three day span from
that video now it doesn't really add up
unless many videos are demonetized
back-to-back which is why I brought up
Steve because many of his were and he
voiced all of his as he should have him
glad he did on Twitter just kind of
pointing out how broken the structure is
so team YouTube on Twitter attempts to
mitigate this issue every single time by
suggesting to anyone who complains about
being demonetised for no reason that
they should
upload their video unlisted for a few
days and let the algorithm work itself
out if something is demonetized hey it's
not public yet so you're not losing any
money we can file for a claim they'll
review it manually and then they'll
romana ties it at which point you can
publicize the video and start making
money from the views but that would
assume first off that people are not
operating on a video to video basis day
to day so most of the videos that you
watch I've literally filmed either that
day of the day before I'm not operating
on a week ahead structure that's just
not how I do things because I'm really a
one-man show at least in the studio on
top of that we the content creators are
penalized for their faulty algorithms
their faulty artificial intelligence I'm
really banging on their system relying
on closed captioning auto interpretation
of closed captions which would mean that
people with different accents different
dialects even speaking in different
languages could have trouble getting
through this algorithm safely I have no
hard evidence to back up this claim but
ask yourself if you were in charge of
developing a filtering system to ensure
that fresh content was clean for
advertisers wouldn't you use Google's
closed captioning system if you can go
ahead and turn on Google's closed
captioning it's CC down at the bottom
right hand side of this video you can
see that it's not perfect you Google's
doing this on its own based on my vocal
patterns but it's good enough for closed
captioning right it gets the point
across most of the time now whether or
not they should be relying on their
closed captioning system is a sort of
filter for content is an entirely
different story but regardless of how
they're doing it the fact is they are
doing it they're doing it to more
content creators than you probably think
and many of us do rely on this income as
at least a good chunk of what we take
home every month to provide food for us
and our families I know people are
thinking well Greg you chose this career
path this is what you've got to be
willing to put up with an imperfect
system it's not going to be perfect it's
being operated by people and even though
a lot of people are relying on the
platform it's going to go through many
changes this one just doesn't happen to
be a good change and that's why it needs
to be addressed in videos like these we
aren't asking for handouts okay that's
not what this video is doing we're
asking simply for what we have earned
not what we think we deserve just what
we have earned based on the past now
things always will change the
amount of money I make per ad might
change based on any fluctuation in the
market period I accept that risk what I
don't accept is YouTube de monetizing a
video completely based on a failed
algorithm for those who are still on the
fence about whether or not this is just
a video about me complaining and ranting
about not getting what I deserve because
I don't have a real job think about it
this way from a real job perspective if
you wanted to work one day and your boss
Camby and said hey we got the last three
days of work all logged all those hours
good stuff but we can't pay you for any
of those three days because we suspect
some sort of illegal activity alright
you'd be pretty frustrated right off the
bat right but then maybe two days after
that your boss comes back to you and
says so we found out that there was no
illegal activity going on during those
three days that's good news I'm glad
that you're still onboard with us but we
still can't pay you for those three days
now you know why so many of us are so
frustrated at YouTube right now during
those days our videos remain demonetised
we make nothing from them zero dollars
and zero cents and once the video is
romana ties dafter manual review we
still have made zero dollars for the
days that it was demonetised and like we
get that money back like oh here's what
you would have earned had ads been
placed in those videos that doesn't
happen to us that money is all down the
drain because of the failed algorithm
again I'm emphasizing this failed
process that YouTube is promoting right
now and they're they're not backing off
of it people have suggested maybe doing
manual review before de monetizing give
us the benefit of the doubt don't
penalize us but then YouTube it's
literally responded to people like Casey
and said well if we'd have to go through
so many videos it's just not possible to
do it that way so now screw us right who
knows maybe this video will be to
monetize - at which point I will be sure
to let you know in the comment section
so check that out and leave a comment
let me know what you guys think about
this issue here
and if you've been affected by it
personally I'd like to know that as well
I'm very grateful to Steve and others
who were persistent through this very
frustrating time here on YouTube I'm
glad that we have other sources of
revenue tech tubers to a particular
Amazon's a big help if you guys want to
contribute you can do so by purchasing
stuff via our affiliate links you can
also donate directly to us be a patreon
my link is in the description many other
channels out there have their links
publicize as well so check all those out
all your favorite content creators be
sure to let them know
you appreciate them at least sorry this
isn't a science video I just feel like
this needs to be said it needs to be
publicized we're all a part of the tech
tuber community and we are all a part of
YouTube and right now the platform it's
looking pretty grim it sucks right now
and it sucks seeing a lot of my close
friend my close tech tuber friends being
hammered left and right by this
ridiculous algorithm of which we are all
a subject if you like this video check
out our links below support us anyway
you can give this video a thumbs up if
