which is Black Thursday I don't know why
that's the case now it's not Friday but
Black Friday deals are here so we're at
Best Buy and it's super crowded we're
going to check out the deals they have
here see if we can no no we're going to
buy some stuff right it reminds me so
I'm gonna buy some stuff so let's go
ahead take a look to see a six thousand
yes it is that beautiful mirrorless
camera oh they're not going to let me I
can't pull the screen out the screen
like flips like upward it's really weird
yeah but it flips around so you can see
it above the camera 549 1080p 60fps yeah
I was thinking about the GoPro it being
a GoPro Hero 5 4k camera is it 4k 60fps
is it still 4k 33c I want that 60fps I
know how you guys feel about that 60fps
I know that fluidity you just enjoy it
you almost got whacked in my house he
was inches from your head
drew graciously pointed out to me that
uh they've expanded their computer
section I don't know if that's because
they realize that people are interested
in stuff thanks to the few videos we've
done here before or they just see a
spike in computer part demand but we've
got our greater RAM selection granted
this isn't really that appealing I mean
I don't know why you'd want to throw
that into a gaming machine but I even
have case fans here
Best Buy sells case fans who know you
can buy case fans at your local Best Buy
the HP spectre x360 this trackpad feels
as good as my max it really does and of
course you have that semi bezel-less
display not quite like the Dell XPS 13
we do have a well almost an inch worth
of bezel up top but that's because the
camera as well as the infrared sensor
both up top versus on the bottom get
that nose cam with the XPS lineup as
well as the new lenovo laptops are also
that way but this is actually a fairly
compelling laptop ultra-thin - you know
it's a nice a nice laptop from HP that's
good to see sporting their new logo of
course i7 7,500 you that is KB Lake KB
leaks out I've been wanting to test a KB
Lake laptop and I haven't done it yet
I feel feel left out of the loop know I
drew you do the math on this one
alien weird gaming laptop scoring an i7
6700 there's there's no K okay okay all
right 16 gigs of memory at least I
didn't go short there a one terabyte SSD
plus 256 gig I'm sorry one terabyte
hardest drives to 256 gig solid-state
drive a gtx 1070 which that's the
founders edition 1070 from what it looks
like see the green hue in there very
nice and OH
case you didn't know it's oculus
certified so how does $1,500 sound
I think we could do a little better than
that okay I think we can build this
entire rig for about a thousand dollars
better case you a better case - yeah
even though you get that cool-looking
Alienware logo I'll give them that I'll
give them that
that's pretty dope but I don't think
that justify is a $500
whatever roughly $500 what a premium
yeah or the power supply they never talk
about power supplies here they really
need to start listing those so you think
at the last video they were caught on I
know a lot of Best Buy employees saw
that video cuz I got got a little heated
at times about they're filming policies
but anyway whatever oculus rift I am
yeah I am I just haven't gotten in a VR
yet and it's probably because I haven't
actually tried VR that's why I'm a
little ant about it I was the same way
about Apple products though to be
completely honest so I'd probably
enjoyed if I bought it but I don't know
what can you play like GTA 5 with an
oculus I think we really do I think so I
need to be really cool yeah I don't know
if that's like mainstream yet or though
 that man and rid of the rescue I
can say his name but I might not be able
to show his face so if it's blurred
policy okay so we're going to see if we
can find the Toshiba Samsung and LG 4k
specials here we got a 55 inch for 479 s
a 4k Ultra HD from Samsung so paying a
bit of a premium for the Samsung logo
Toshiba 4k 49 inch for 200 bucks yeah
let's see if they're severely I doubt I
doubt it so DJI phantom 3 which is this
one right here for $800 4k video 12
megapixel photo auto take off and return
home is that worth it drew 800 bucks
eventually I will buy one I might buy
one that's compatible with a GoPro
no these I'm not sure you can exchange
them I don't think you can like it does
have like the gyrus here with anti
vibration which is very helpful keeps it
from wobbling yeah you found sing around
ok you see they're just giving away TVs
yeah $90 I mean I know it's only 1080p
it's only 32 minutes whatever 90 bucks
for a TV like three years ago in this
form factor unheard of I'm not just
looking at some of your TVs what you got
left over pretty sure these are gonna be
sold out you got anything that's like
competitive I mean I know all those are
gone but like you have anything else
that's decent looking for 4k around 50
inch that's not above $400 all gone yeah
are you recording this is for a YouTube
channel that's not bad for 79 at 55 inch
from Samsung like I said you're paying
if you're paying a bit of a premium for
that name but you're going to get
quality with Samsung and it's not going
to blow up okay fine I'll blow up that's
a really good price to to for my gosh I
got rid of 200 member that okay remember
that deal on Twitter that I shared a few
days ago is about a sous monitor like
359 something like that this is a TN
panel right there's TT and yes I
whatever but you say this price one
millisecond yeah so ghosting is like not
gonna happen
and 250 bucks for this right here 28
inches of 4k beauty that really is a
good-looking monitor all right I love
pork and I love Clips all right I have
clips is personally my dad has perks and
those are those are two of my favorite
brands just because I know them very
well I know that they're quality brands
75 bucks I feel it
$75 two in the front two here two in the
back and then what you have like a
center yes yeah yes you put two subs so
like one on each side or one on the
front one in the back one of these days
I'm meaning to get pops one of these for
a long time a Wi-Fi is straight trash at
our house this would change everything
oh the good old days true I know some of
the good old days yeah this has a power
supply that is not inside the system
thank you thank you viewers point that
out making us feel stupid but that makes
complete sense
not really expecting anything special in
terms of graphics cards sales that's why
isn't known for selling graphics cards
and like really pushing those but we do
have quite the selection 1070 from EVGA
founders editions 10 70s and 80s few 10
60s Rx 484 gigabyte and a gigabyte yeah
decent selection and I'm pleased to see
that they're keeping up with their power
supply stop that's nice because yeah
just good to have a lot of power
supplies on hand oh wow so you can hear
the game and hear what's going on with
your phone
that's like simultaneous broadcasting I
like it and you can also have its
elusive earbuds yeah I expected most of
the good sales to be gone already so you
might be in the video ok cool right now
drew they do have that's not bad
you got a 120 gig SSD down there for 45
bucks that's what that is right my
second yeah yes I mean this you can find
them on Amazon for anywhere between 35
and 45 bucks so the fact that Best Buy
even has them oh yeah look at that
good call drew 500 gigabyte Samsung Evo
850 130 bucks that's compelling look at
that better price than the PNY counter
for it never thought I would see the day
that's actually a really good price Wow
pretty good yeah something about these
crowds just turns me off from wanting to
buy anything the fact that I have to
wait an hour long line just to purchase
the product
I can't walk we're got the Parkway that
gear dude oh my gosh it's going right
now yeah throw away what are you doing
quick of a stop sign and like real there
is not a single parking spot anywhere up
front I mean in the vicinity of the
store there's not a single parking spot
you bring your hiking boots true I did
got my Apple watch let's get her Fitness
on so we don't get lost out of there do
you see that you say okay ah yeah but uh
that was chaotic no there's too many
people I'm pretty sure they don't have
any like killer deals anyway the fact
that I couldn't even walk into the
electronics I'm not smart on their part</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
