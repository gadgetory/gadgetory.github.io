PC today for gaming primarily you'd have
two or three solid combos from which to
choose first the gaming King the i7 8700
K pretend that's what this is it's in
the system right now I already reviewed
the CPU in a dedicated video or right
here and validated the affirmation
statement without a doubt this is the
best gaming CPU on the market its
overclocking potential and six
multi-threaded cores pack a huge punch
and even allow for background streaming
and rendering at the same time it's
selling currently in the mid 300 US
dollar range about on par with its
predecessors and should be paired with
AZ 370 motherboard which will set you
back an additional one to two hundred
bucks with 16 gigs of ram thrown into
the mix we're looking at around $700 for
the entire platform not too bad if you
ask me now as for the coffee liqueur I
580 600 K we get the exact same
overclocking potential without hyper
threading and $100 discount overall the
question we're gonna answer in this
video is this $100 discount worth it if
you're gonna yield similar frame rates
in games because we all know that I 5s
are generally the best gaming value
chips on the market at least on intel
side we're gonna avoid AMD for this
video but we'll revisit that topic in a
separate video in the future I struggled
in deciding between running these
benchmarks at stock versus overclocked
so I had each running at 4.8 gigahertz
respectively so as to include even the
worst case scenario overclockers don't
want to leave anyone behind with a
terrible bin that's not really their
fault more or less look at the draw I'll
be testing these two platforms with a
gtx 1070 TI from EVGA it's a well
balanced graphics card that you probably
can't find anywhere right now for a
decent price that is this for the win
Edition is a two and a half slot card
and runs very quiet as detailed in this
video right here
our clock speeds will be stock out of
the box for these tests you're about to
see but you'll squeak close to a
founders edition 1080 with a decent
overclock in terms of performance this
is a great card the same 16 gig kit of
3000 merits ddr4 from Corsair will be
used to simulate an ideal gaming config
and to eliminate any potential issues
with newer titles you can find all of
these components by the way linked in
the video description one last thing I
want to point out before viewing these
benchmarks is that these are strictly
gaming scenarios obviously any
background multitasking or streaming
will result in escalated CPU usage in
particular which I
covered in detail in this video right
here so I'm singling point in a lot of
videos but these will help you out I
don't recommend an i-5 for streaming
despite the extra core bump with this
generation and I don't recommend
anything below horizon five 1600 from
AMD side for the same tasks okay now on
to the benchmarks the be quiet dark bass
700 brings luxury in silence to the
mainstream luxury thanks to subtle RGB
integration full case modularity and
even USB type-c support and silence
thanks to 3 included silent wings 3 fans
and sound damping foam all around click
the link in this video's description for
more details we'll start first as always
with grand theft auto 5 at very high
settings and no anti-aliasing or
advanced graphics we saw an admirable
122 fps in 1080p from the i7 8700 k that
dip to 74 FPS across the lowest 1% of
frames and 56 across the lowest point 1
percent
these are keep in mind with an EVGA gtx
1070 TI we saw a few frame time spikes
at around the 500 frame toward the
beginning of the benchmark that I
wouldn't tribute them to a bottleneck on
the CPU side of any kind
as for the i5 8600 k nearly comparable
performance across the board 120 FPS on
average 1% lows at 74 and 0.1% at 51 in
a nutshell gamers are better off with
the i-5 in this case better value with
not so much sacrificed on a performance
side pub G was the next game on my list
but the new 3:9 1.0 one drivers from
Nvidia this game should see a noticeable
boost with a 1070 Ti from our previous
benchmarks and sure enough of the i7
8700 K and medium settings save you
distance turned up to max and foliage
drop too low
we saw 130 FPS on average 1% dropped to
73 and point 1 percent to 51 I want to
show you this frame time graph by the
way because we saw an enormous spike I
don't run the 20,000th frame I played
the entire session by the way so I
lasted pretty long this amounts to
nearly two and a half seconds of delay
between frames at one point which is
pretty abysmal the i5 held its own as
well and didn't experience the same huge
spike oddly enough so I have absolutely
no idea what caused this but it didn't
occur anywhere else during the gameplay
still worth pointing out though you know
I'm not gonna
completely get rid of that data just
because it is an anomaly it's something
worth mentioning the next game tested
was doom I ran this one in DirectX 11 to
ensure accurate frame rates were
measured fraps and DirectX 12 have a
love-hate relationship at this point so
average FPS for the i7 was 188 followed
by 138 and 116 while the i-5 scored just
a bit higher which is a bit strange 192
on average with 1% of 0.1% lows falling
to 143 and 118 respectively I wouldn't
look too far into this though what I
think you should take away is that
performance between the two is nearly
identical both CPUs experienced a few
frame times spikes here and there but
excellent work elsewhere as for rise of
the Tomb Raider in DirectX 11 more or
less a benchmark at this point because I
don't really play the game the i7
experienced a 124 FPS average dipping to
81 and then 62 for the lowest point 1%
the i5 saw a similar decline 119 to 79
to 62 again very consistent here you
won't notice a difference in gaming if
this is all you're doing next up is
planet coaster a new one I like to test
because it's more or less like a roller
coaster tycoon modern edition excellent
in-game detail and physics running the
redundant sandbox simulation the I said
and pulled just over a hundred frames
per second on average with the lowest
point 1% dipping to just over 50 fps the
i-5 was almost the exact same story by
the way in simulation games like these
you're more or less limited by the
titles optimization CPU usage in both
runs was extremely low and GPU usage
never past 80% which is a signal that
the game is not properly optimized it's
rather new anyway next up is City
skylines I'll keep this thing short and
sweet running the Los Santos custom map
and max settings apart from depth of
field the i7 maintained a slight albeit
negligible lead over the i-5 this one's
still CPU intensive but as i've proven
in this video right here city's best
utilizes a maximum of 3 cores which is
odd but that's just that's what we found
so both of these CPUs can handle the
program with ease witcher 3 is the very
GPU independent game in this set of
benchmarks but I always try to throw it
in for the sake of consistency in 1080p
ultra our frame rate jumped to 94 for
the i7 94 again for the i-5 and things
stayed fairly close for the rest of the
way down we did have to max out our
10:7 ET i though and that's just
indicative of a very GPU intensive title
and games like these core counted
frequency are slightly less important
lastly universe sandbox two's earth and
many moons simulation yields 88 FPS on
average dipping quickly once the moon's
collided down to 34 FPS the lowest one
percent and i'm here 28 FPS for the
lowest point one percent on the i-580
600k side the trend starts at 82 dips to
30 and ends as low as 21 since the cpu
bottlenecks in the situation having
multi-threading on board results in a
noticeable improvement overall something
we should expect but not the general
trend among triple-a titles today so my
conclusion is this apart from the minor
changes in power draw because the i7
will draw a bit more power and
efficiency the i5 8600 k is a slightly
better value proposition i think in the
long run it's not going to be as
future-proof obviously that would be a
reason to go for the i7 you expect to do
streaming and other things in the
background the i7 is the better bet on
intel side and for about 350 or so bucks
that's not too bad the issue I want to
bring up though regarding a locked
versus unlock SKUs in this current
market is that because we only have
access to Z 370 chipsets it makes more
sense to buy the unlocked SKU so if
you're considering an i-5 8400 I would
only purchase that if I had something
other than an unlocked chipset at my
disposal because those are gonna cost a
bit more so it makes sense to pair a
locks key with a lock chipset if you
have to spend more money on the Z 370
board spend a bit more money to on the
8600 case you can extract that extra
performance out of that overclock you
might achieve upwards of 5 gigahertz or
so these are pretty good overclockers
that said between the two unlocks queues
the i-5 in the i7
we saw negligible differences in almost
every single title tested there's
something to be said about that I would
even argue that the i-5 8600 K is
sufficient for streaming and some of my
early testing I found that the framerate
dip really isn't all that substantial
the six cores are really taken on a lot
especially when overclocked so maybe not
the i-5 8400 for streaming and gaming
but the Indy 600 K might be able to
handle that with a solid overclock again
though if you're gonna spend that much
on a CPU and then that much more on an a
IO or a large air cooler why not just
get the i7 and put a cheaper cooler on
there and then have multi-threading at
your disposal right so it's kind of a
give and take there but for now the if5
86
kay should be all you consider if you're
a true gamer at heart six cores is
plenty even if not overclocked so if the
eighty-six under case seems a bit out of
reach dropping to the 8400 should still
result in some solid performance again
though I would wait until the non Z 370
chipsets hit the market you can again
find links to all of these CPUs down in
the description along with a few
motherboards I'd recommend for each if
you liked this video be sure to let me
know by giving this one a thumbs up I
appreciate it thumbs down for the
obstacle you subscribe but if you
