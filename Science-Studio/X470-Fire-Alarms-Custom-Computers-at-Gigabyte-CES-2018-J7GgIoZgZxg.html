Vegas this is Caesar's Palace here in
the Gigabyte suite it's pretty large
they have a lot of stuff to show off as
usual the probably most prominent thing
I want to talk about in this video is
the new X 470 motherboard that's right X
470 they can't say it but I can
this board is built with overclocking in
mind when we get down and dirty with
this thing and then eventually we'll
benchmark with it so own any of the card
for this next one here for interesting
GV dash in 1080i xev dash 8gb so this is
basically a full on desktop grade GTX
1080 in a box and they've actually used
some custom boards in here to get it to
fit into this form factor because this
is fairly small it's one of the smallest
I've ever seen dedicated power of course
you'd plug this in like you would
anything else like a TV or a monitor or
a computer and then you've got four USB
ports down here and a single USB
Thunderbolt 3 port this is what you use
to connect this box to your laptop so
that your I don't know Ultrabook like
maybe your XPS 13 or your MacBook
13-inch even this has been proven to
work with Mac's a little finicky still
but they're working on it you could
connect this to that and get full on
desktop grade graphics in those
ultrabooks
really really looking forward to getting
my hands on this thing right here so
this is our motherboard I love these
you've already seen not too many
exciting boards that are new being
released other than the one that you saw
in the beginning of this video but one I
want to highlight because it looks so
good and I want to get my hands on I
really can't find too many uses for X
299 boards but one that looks good like
this the x2 nine-nine designator I think
it's designee my call at Ephraim Allen I
said Visayan air in my previous design
ever review Oh designating it this is a
silver themed board as usual and it's
got all the notes and crannies and they
give you some sweet b-roll to look at
right now basically it's another x2 99
board for those who are Intel savvy you
know what you can get with the x2 9
platform but you get at least some
pretty sweet aesthetics when it comes to
the designator
alright here's something we want to try
to emulate in the studio basically this
is like a ripped out LCD screen they
stick it against a tempered glass panel
like
and you just connect it like you would a
typical monitor via HDMI or what have
you and you can run display effects like
this in front of your PC you could add
there's several modifications like that
you can do online but this one's a
really cool implementation here with
very beautiful white accents we all know
how I feel about color white we have the
GTX 1080p i from gigabyte stuck in here
and i 780 700 k and 16 gigs of g.skill
tried it in z ddr4 i really like this
idea i think our next big build apart
from the one I'm working on currently
will feature something like this and
we've got another custom cool PC here
from envious mod you guys always do
great work we've got dual GTX 1070 is
not custom cooled we have some pretty
sweet sent out the back plates on here
that I want to get my hands on it makes
this car look much much better than it
already does I love the red fluid we got
a custom cooled Ram which is totally
unnecessary but it looks really cool so
I'm actually glad they went with that
and then we've got it's like super sweet
t-virus looking reservoir in here with
it not topped off which I actually
prefer - you can see the fluid churning
inside this is a really cool build a
really nice modded bill not just custom
but fully modded yeah will can't drive
very well so like he doesn't have his
license
it's a fire alarm going off right now
well set the fire alarm off oh this is
great yeah you're he's pushing the
clutch they can get to the brake
well are you riding the brake with your
left foot no that's not touch me a bit
still all right here we go well you some
boy oh use the brake okay hey I did he
do well finishing the team's again
hey Britain you finished you actually
finished all you didn't finish but
Frogger I saw some people even it's very
hard for them to drive through the
through the corner still keep spinning
like three or like what number did they
come I believe me it's 5/5 I how do you
actually you're in the fourth
Oh then I'll let the yeah oh well I was
fourth take that Taiwan he didn't come
dead last interesting
we were gonna plant an outro here but uh
fire alarms gone pretty crazy
I don't like it guys if I hear it anyway
we are going to end this sweet tour by
showing you how like we're gonna pan
around here
if Lisa will bring the camera around
start from the left they have a golf
simulator actually way over to the left
side here I'm not gonna attempt to do
that because I'm not very good at golf
will will you should totally do that
we'll play they don't play the golf
simulator and that's how we're gonna end
the video we appreciate gigabyte for
sending us out to CES 2018 here in Vegas
we appreciate the fire alarm for making
a recording just major pain
we're gonna put the post yeah we're
gonna play golf so we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
