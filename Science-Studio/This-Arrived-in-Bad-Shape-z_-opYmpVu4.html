gypped on PC Hardware on a site like
eBay doesn't take very much effort I
bought a GTX 1080 cooler just the cooler
and at first glance and I'm thinkin
alright that's cool I mean I hope you
have the PCB obviously I do it's sitting
right here in this water block and I
haven't been able to use the card
because it's in a water block and I
haven't custom cooled in quite a while
so I decided to go back to stock I ended
up ditching the old coolers I had
actually they were EVGA coolers at the
time but they use the reference PCB so I
decided to just go for reference in this
case problem with this cooler though I
mean again from far away it looks fine
but there are some imperfections cuts
scratches all over the shroud that makes
me wonder what the heck the previous
owner did with this car
so this here is the Shroud slash cooler
pretty much everything is here except
for the PCB which is exactly what I
wanted cuz again I have the PCB just I
ditch the cooler problem with this is
for one you can see we've got some very
ominous scratches that are kind of just
all over it looks like he keyed this you
know like we need Kia car he just like
looks like he took a Phillips
screwdriver and just slapped the thing
over and over and over so that's a
little distasteful they're scratches
along the rest of the shroud it just
doesn't look pretty I think I'm gonna
have to take the support and paint this
rad which I've done before it won't be
an issue the only problem is getting
paint off of the gtx 280 logo we want to
keep that reflective and if we paint
over that it's not gonna look as great
also on this side this is your back
plate right only there are several
screws missing including one two three
around the GPU we're missing two big
screws on this side one and one and then
over here and other screws missing
another screws missing another screws
missing and then another screw is
missing so I actually have some leftover
screws I was not too confident in the
seller when I bought it so to be honest
I kind of did this to myself but there
are some context clues you can kind of
pick up on if you notice the pictures
are blurry for one that that's a dead
giveaway that the sellers probably
hiding something even the old camera
phones nowadays have pretty decent
cameras you can at least see some detail
so if they're blurry asked for some
retakes or at least get confidence into
writing that the item is as described
and in the condition in which it is
described so what we're gonna do is swap
this out I will probably end up painting
this I don't know if I'll not do that in
this video painting takes a while if you
want to do it the right way but we will
swap the cooler swap the card back into
the cooler and then we'll run some tests
we might even play around with thermal
Chris Lisa carbon op pads again I might
just put one of those in here and see
how it fares so stay tuned for all that
and yeah just ignore ignore these
blemishes what on earth was he doing
with this card
all right so a quick switch to the phone
I'm in the garage right now and you can
see I've repainted everything yeah we
lost the mirrored finish over the GTX
logo I don't think it's too bad though
the finish looks great I was just using
where is it right over here
not Clorox disinfecting wipes I was
using just restoring a high-performance
enamel I actually use this and another
project you'll probably see in the
future but this is good stuff and then I
also painted the the back piece remember
it was really scratched right back here
and now that's completely gone funny
enough the colors almost perfectly match
you can see on the side here I really
didn't paint that but it looks almost
identical to what was freshly painted on
top so that's pretty good and you see
that's the black part we're going to
keep that there now the last thing I'm
doing something a little different might
as well but don't have any black engine
enamel so I'm actually gonna paint the
back plates silver yeah just something
new we'll try it out see how it looks
all right and here is the finished
product now I know it kind of looks the
same on this side that's kind of the
point I didn't want it to look much
different obviously the mirror finish
here over the GTX 1080 text is is gone I
could probably try to chip that away but
I'm really not too concerned about it
most cards are gonna sit you know this
way in the build anyway but it's
actually clean finished and then again
the paint I used was pretty close to the
original finish over this silver part of
the shroud so I'm I'm happy with it look
there's still some scuffs and scratches
on the glass you're not gonna really see
them too much there you go there's a
good good angle and there's a couple
scuffs on the fan of course when the fan
turns you can't really see that now the
other thing I did I showed you guys a
bit earlier is I painted this part of
the card silver now if I decide I'm not
a fan of this I can just go back and
paint it black not a big deal but this
was pretty scuffed up too so alright I
just I figured I'd try the silver scheme
and just see how I looked I not not the
best finish I think I did a much better
job on the on the shroud side so the
paint job overall I started to run out
of paint that's not an excuse actually
it is but whatever war with it and so I
think given the circumstances is okay
but maybe I will repaint this black if I
decide to like resell or something I
actually bought this card I believe it
was from Best Buy
about a year and a half two years ago so
it's still doing well but we do need to
confirm the court actually works and
that everything temp wise is in check so
let's plug this into a system and make
sure all right and you can see our score
right there it's 15,000 136 now for
those of you who were pretty keen on the
subtle details of the PCB this is
actually a gtx 1070 PCB with a 1080
quarter they're basically the exact same
car there's small differences on the
board but for the most part the you know
that's why you can use the same cooler
for both so you can see down here
confirmed gtx 1070 we have the 9900 k in
here so that's kind of where score is
what it is
so that was totally my bad to begin with
i thought this was a 1080 i actually
have two other 1080s here and these two
i thought i bought a third one one of
these i bought on ebay like 300 bucks
and i thought i had two more boards i'm
not sure where the other board is well
yeah we'll figure out what them I would
happen to that but anyway doesn't really
matter I mean I'm gonna keep this for
myself I guess I'll have to switch that
shroud out to a 1070 shroud if I ever
want to resell it but I thought that was
a 1080 I'll have to do a good thing is
we kind of work in it's air-cooled now
and it looks pretty darn good in my
opinion okay so well yeah that was a
little embarrassing but we got the job
done and we needed to get done in this
video I hope you enjoyed it just
something off the cuff I wanted to do a
little project you got to see the
painting at least the finished product
and yeah we'll move on from here next
video should be one that you'll really
enjoy actually a budget oriented PC
build it's gonna look really good I
think
given the amount of money we're gonna
spend on the parts so stay tuned for
that and more content here on science to
