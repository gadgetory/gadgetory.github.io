like it's so wide and it's not really
practical for a lot of things we do but
in this case at least for the
introduction I like to kind of show off
a little but it also makes my head look
huge and it already looks huge to begin
with so I'm aware of that this is my
personal laptop so huawei mate book X
Pro it's one of the most powerful ultra
books you can buy the reason being it's
got the i7 here I 78550 you I want to
say I'll put up something if I'm wrong
but it's a proper quad-core hyper
threaded processor again it's ultra low
power so it's it's not gonna compare
with a desktop core i7 but the big
selling point for me was the discreet
graphics in here that's namely the MX
150 now I did confirm granted not on
huawei's website but somewhere else that
the MX much within here is the lower TV
chip so it's not as powerful as the
standard or whether you wanna call it
MX 150 that you'll find in some beefier
laptops reason being this is a very thin
laptop and it's not going to be able to
cool the higher TDP unit so my
assumption is that just chose the lower
power option not only save money but
also to keep the thermals in check we're
going to fix that though I mean what was
already kind of ok to begin with we're
gonna make it even better
by applying a liquid metal to both the
GPU and the CPU
you're sick of seeing the same
activation watermark with your shiny new
rig snagging OEM Windows 10 Pro key from
s CD key even if you've already
installed Windows 10 on your machine you
can shell out a little over 10 bucks for
an authentic key that'll activate your
copy click the link below and use offer
code s studio for an 18 percent discount
on your order so the tools you're going
to need a very simple t6 Torx screws we
have the CT 6 head here get this one and
I got my little cobalt total screwdriver
it's very convenient you can swap out
the head so I'll link something like
this down below and then you'll probably
need something like a credit card or
they have a Buster's card I'm pretty
sure something on it if there is rip
those tickets so about further ado it's
not taking it apart ok definitely not a
t6 Torx screw probably it's got to be t5
one step down hopefully doesn't t4
because I don't have that Oh perfect t5
there we go you know the may pick X Pro
gets a lot of hate from Apple fans for
looking oddly similar to a MacBook Pro
and I agree my review of this laptop I
said straight up that it looks like they
ripped off Apple's design but from an
Apple fanboys perspective I won't see
that as a compliment I mean if it's a
good design why wouldn't you copy it at
least to the extent that you could get
away with it liebelei ok all a Torx
screws have been removed time now for
the Dave &amp;amp; Buster's pry and I'm gonna
start here in the back so it looks like
the back part of this is already
starting to come up just a bit let's see
how easy this is I'm just kind of don't
let's just pull it up at this point all
right here we go and check that out so a
totally custom cooling solution you see
we got a fan over on this side and then
we have three flattened copper heat
pipes that run from this is the CPU here
too
the GPU which is I believe over on this
side our RAM is here our system RAM and
then our G Ram is right here just
underneath the GPU so we're gonna take
this off next so you can see what's
underneath there and also obviously need
to get to the dies of each so that we
can apply our liquid metal solution so
it looks like these are just small
Phillips heads okay so there is one
ribbon cable to mind it's connected for
some reason to the heat shield but it
ties both of these logic boards together
after this is the motherboard here and
it looks like this is USB yeah this is
the USB a section of the laptop so keep
this in mind I want to rip this and
Snagit it's gonna be a pain to get back
up and running anyway that is removed
now we're gonna clean off that thermal
compound and we're also going to clean
it off of the CPU here which looking
pretty messy but get some isopropyl
alcohol
now preferably for this section you're
going to want something along the lines
of 99% isopropyl alcohol I don't have
any one person here I have 70% and yeah
it's just your typical topical
antiseptic it's gonna be good enough to
get rid of the stock then we'll paste
here get up as much of this as you can
obviously a lint-free cloth something
like that would be better for this there
we go looks pretty good there and not
much lint which is nice not that it's
gonna really ruin anything and you
notice that our GPU actually is cleaned
to begin with and that's because instead
of thermal paste being used we just had
a little thermal pad so we could stick
with this but I'm gonna swap it out
anyway because the GPU does still get
pretty hot under load especially a full
load so we're gonna swap it anyway it's
still got a copper slug there as does
the CPU still copper base and these are
tied directly to the copper pipe so that
run around the fan so we want this
contact and copper is gonna be okay at
least for a few I would say a few months
without a doubt well
we use liquid metal all right so now
that this plate is totally cleaned off
what we're going to do is try to mask
off the area where the copper is going
to make contact with the liquid metal
it'll be difficult to do there are some
little traces in here and you can't
really see that from that far away now
but they're a little indentions here
that show kind of the perimeter of where
each of those dye is going to make
contact with the copper we're gonna have
to just get it as close as we can
because you want to apply liquid metal
of both sides of the copper block before
we do that though we want to protect the
snv's wrapping around particularly the
GPU you see the dye there in the center
that we've small SMD is wrapping around
we want to cover these up with nail
polish and that's going to prevent any
liquid mountain metal spillage from
shorting any of those assemblies out and
that would be catastrophic for the CPU
and probably the entire system so I'm
going to use white nail polish I was a
little hesitant at first because most
people recommend clear nail polish it
just looks a lot better and sometimes
the paint can be reacted of this paint
is not conductive or anything like that
I already checked i probed it actually
and then I also saw a devourer use red
nail polish at one point so if you use
thread I'm gonna use white it's gonna
look weird but it'll do the job and so
let's go ahead and just start oh gosh
painting this white this is gonna look
really weird all right and it definitely
looks weird but it's gonna do what we
want it to do that's good I did get just
a tiny bit there on the edge of the dye
you're gonna there we go okay everything
else looks good and now we can start
applying a liquid metal now for obvious
reasons we're going to use conduct a
knot and this is just the tried-and-true
stuff I've used ever since I started
getting a few years ago so now if you
haven't seen this before because we do
have a few videos talking about it we're
gonna use this needle nose little edges
like then wire applicator tool here this
is gonna have to be very specific with
where we apply the liquid metal and then
we can use this little nozzle here to
gather up any excess if we may apply it
too much because it's gonna be kind of
sensitive and liquid metal behaves very
oddly compared to like water so you'll
get to see some of that here in action
now once you've added just a small
little beat sized amount to each of the
dyes you want to take one of these
q-tips these are a little more fine and
rough than the standard q-tips you can
find at Walmart you want to use these if
you can to kind of spread it around it's
gonna behave again very weird you got to
give it some force and kind of cover
that upper layer which is the thin film
of it and then it should spread fairly
evenly so kind of play with it for a
little bit I'll start with the GPU here
you can see it's gonna be a little
stubborn at first it's gonna want to be
pushed around and it's gonna want to
stay in one or two big clumps so I just
keep working with it and eventually
you'll get it all so be very careful we
don't wanna push this over the edge
okay looks pretty good let's move on to
the CPU now see it's spreading very
nicely on the CPU okay so the GPU looks
really good I think we've got a little
too much on especially that smaller die
there but yeah I'm not sure if I want to
try to get that up or not we've probably
got a little too much here on the CPU
side of things but I don't think it's
gonna be too terrible even if this just
runs over a tiny bit it looks like we've
got plenty of room to spare so yeah add
a little less than that's always good to
add less and it's kind of progressively
add more as you need it you guys can see
this I'm going to attempt to cover I'm
not entirely sure how I'm gonna do this
I might just cover the whole thing with
a very thin layer of it because it's
gonna be difficult to line that up you
could have what I could have done really
was looked at the outline of the thermal
paste beforehand and kind of made a
mental note of that maybe taped it off
but in this case I have to just eyeball
it or kind of apply it everywhere
so we'll see this isn't gonna look
perfect but it's important that you
apply a thin layer to the copper side as
well so that you get that that that
contact that you need from this liquid
metal solution I'm gonna add a tiny bit
more to this one okay it's not a perfect
application but it should still get the
job done yeah so I think that's where
I'm gonna call it I know one thing I
noticed was that there there weren't any
thermal pads here around the ramp
scissors sk hynix ram here for the for
the GPU and then we've got our these are
gonna be for gig chips here each it's a
16 gig laptop for system ram and these
are also sk hynix
and so there's no thermal pad or
anything here for these there's no
thermal pad for the
I could add one I'm just not sure if
adding one is going to you know mess up
the the contact pressure for the the
copper plate here okay cool
now I dropped it straight in because I
didn't want to push any of that excess
liquid metal off of the die just in case
and looks like everything's lined up
I've got this ribbon reconnected and
we're gonna slide this back into place
this little bracket here there we go and
yes so now we can screw everything back
in all right so we're ready to go you
see we have all four CPU cores showing
as well as the GPU I believe this is GPU
diode it's not specific and I'm pretty
sure there's only one with the MX 150
and then I also have just 3d mark the
window open but it's not running and
then MSI Afterburner running in the
background because otherwise our GPU or
MX 150 is disabled so I'm going to go
ahead and start and let's see how hot
this baby gets under load all right so a
little over 15 minutes now a bit longer
than I anticipated but that's because I
wanted to see if this trend here
continued and it does so it actually got
a little cooler at one point and it's
been pretty much leveled off for the
last eight or so minutes and because
this is an air-cooled system obviously
once it's heat soaked it's not gonna be
able to dump any more heat than it
already is so that's why we're seeing
kind of that flat line there and I would
say 70 degrees is pretty sweet for a
system under full load remember this is
system Ram this is the GPU the CPU FPU
cache pretty much everything except for
the local disks are being stressed right
now and 70 degrees in a small
form-factor ultra low-profile laptop
like this is pretty impressive
the next test I ran was 3d mark x spy
and this is actually our second take
here 958 our first take was 963 so a
slightly lower score the second time
around that's to be expected the
components have been hotter for a bit
longer but there was no thermal
throttling of any kind as indicated by
i-264 hardware utilization monitoring
and that is about 60 or so points higher
the average of those two scores than the
previous three runs that I had with time
spy before the alum application so
beforehand we were between 819 about
nine
five so we actually got a score increase
and a lot of that has to do with the
fact that now our CPU and GPU are not
reaching 90 or 95 degrees Celsius the MX
150 s frequency is gonna throw it a
little bit anyway naturally so the
higher the temperature gets the lower
that effective frequency to kind of
conserve itself and prevent it from
overheating the CPU will do the same
thing it will straight up thermal
throttle past I believe I'm not sure
what t-junction is for the 85 50 you
it's something like 95 or a hundred
degrees Celsius either way the score are
definitely improved and I am very
impressed thus far so that is that folks
I love this laptop I love that the
temperatures are now in check and
there's really no throttling of any kind
at this point and you saw we were
stressing in i-264 during our Cinebench
run during our 3dmark runs everything
temp wise was in check and that's
exactly what I wanted and actually it
runs a lot quieter now I've noticed to
the fans pulls up but it really only
does so under very prolonged you know
stress tests and things of that sort so
a really nice improvement there if you
guys enjoyed this video let me know by
give this one a thumbs up I appreciate
it thanks for watching thanks for the
curiosity and I will catch you in the
next one this is science studio thanks
for watching again and thanks for
learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
