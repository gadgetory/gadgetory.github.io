chill and fantex check out their links
in this video's description for your
simple and complex pc building needs
anyone seen a white fitting I put it
somewhere on this board but the Arctic
camouflage is just too intense what's up
everyone I would like for you to me to
potentially want to be whitest PC builds
on YouTube this is part one of likely
three maybe four depending if I include
benchmarks in a part but yet the idea
here so we're going to put together a
very white PC it's going to have pretty
much everything sporting some sort of
white accent if not just the full-on
white thing here so this is all like you
know 24-pin completely white reservoirs
completely white we're going to use
white fluid from pretty much so all of
the custom live gear you're going to see
here with the exception of the graphics
card water block and the CPU block will
be from pre module so prima chill has
really done as a solid here centers a
ton of stuff to make this build possible
I'm going to go through and detail all
these parts here soon but they have you
know the white reservoir they have the
white radiators they even sent over
white cables and then on top of that we
also have an MSI X 299 tomahawk Arctic
motherboard this one was just released
it's a solid by sending us out as
quickly as they did so huge thanks to
them as well and as I mentioned earlier
fantex this is their glacier GTX 10 atti
founders edition water block this has
RGB integration built in so we're going
to install that block probably in this
part in part 1 we also have a sea sonic
power supply 80 plus gold sea Sonic is
you know one of the most reputable
brands around when it comes to power
supply so they were very cool sent us
one of those over this is pretty much it
for what you haven't seen before we've
got to tread it Zee RGB ddr4 kit this is
a 32 gig kit 8 gigabyte DIMMs and uh so
there's obviously four in here and we're
going to set the color preset to white
that's where it's going to stay because
obviously I mean ya wouldn't make much
sense to go with anything else at this
point and lastly the CPU that will go
inside the x2 9 9 motherboard is going
to be di 970 900 X why not I already
have a box opener I don't need another
one so let's go ahead and throw it in
here and make it as overkill as possible
this budget creative imagination
ms:i nailed it with this boards look
scientists I haven't even tested this
thing I don't know if it works frankly
I'm sure will they've already run a few
tests with this board back at their HQ
but this thing looks absolutely gorgeous
white PCB as far as I'm aware the only
x2 99y PCB on the market and unlike
other white PCB competitors this one
doesn't have any of those weird ugly tan
accents raining it's just is all white
or some shade of white and it's going to
look so good when paired with all of
this from primo chill here's a close-up
of one of these killer
primo chill G quarter fittings you can
get these in pretty much any color you
want on their website it's linked in the
description if you want to check things
out or stuff for your next custom PC
build you can get them in virtually any
color you can have them paint your
fittings pretty much all of them your
radiators which is a new thing it's also
super cool course I went with white in
this case you go with blue blacks
whatever red and you can even get your
reservoir accents painted and you can
design some custom cables for your build
as well again all on their website which
is really cool they're pretty much
unifying the entire custom build
experience so the plan for this building
is a 240 millimeter reservoir with the
d5 pump attached below this is going to
stand upright in our fans XP 400s we
have a three hundred sixty millimeter
radiator up front and a small 120 at the
rear now the last few pieces I want to
show you before we actually begin
building are from San Texas sent over
the p400s tempered glass Edition this is
the white version I reviewed it in a
card right here they asked they also
have a white special edition which has a
white basement and white accents but
it's actually going to black outside
coating so I didn't go for that one
because I wanted a white case and will
have black accents apart from just the
basement whatnot anyway so this so the
rad fins are black so it's going to be
okay it'll be a white and black thing
but mostly white now the other two
things that they send that are super
cool and I'm glad that these are
available now this is their CPU water
block with RGB integration this is a
beautiful-looking blog I cannot wait to
put this thing on and just see how it
how it fits with the rest of the build
and then the 1080 TI block follows suit
and design this one is also gorgeous
check that
could that looks I can't get over just
the clean aesthetic here fantex is an
excellent job with this just design
overall it does not come at the back
plate which is a bit disappointing I
will admit they have a few extra ones
lying around good for reference cards
and this also has RGB supports so white
LEDs in here and also white LEDs in the
CPU block so we've got quite a bit of
work to do I expect this to be an
eight-hour day three or four day project
hopefully it pays off aesthetically
though I think this will be one of my
cleanest built to date and I'm going to
love the white color scheme once
everything is in here the white with the
black contrast should look pretty dope
everything kind of scattered all over
the place there's more stuff in the
hallway outside of this room let's get
to building
okay deep sigh of relief this is day two
of the build processes where I'm at
after the second day and this is where
I'm gonna call it quits for part 1 if
you wonder where the back plate is don't
worry I have one in the works the one
that I had planned to use didn't fit
with the fan textblock as is so I'm
doing a few things to get that to work
out so it does look stupid have like a
black PCB board and a white PCB board
behind it so I'll get that taken care of
don't worry you want to say one thing
about these fittings these are by far
the best I've ever used period so Bravo
pretty much so you guys nailed it
they're super easy to use super easy to
secure the tubing and the color is
phenomenal again you can choose any
color you want practically for these
fittings here along with most of the
gear that you see in this case now one
thing I want to say about the reservoir
it's a bit tricky because the the pump
the d5 pump is actually attached down
below the way that it's set up is I
originally thought we had to have the
the out port coming from this one here
but it's actually on the backside just
because the nature of which way to pump
spin so fluids actually be coming out
the back I have a cap on the backside so
I have to put this fitting back there
and then cap the front and that's going
to suck because then I have to have a
tube coming up and around and neither do
the graphics cards or to the radiator of
top or something and it has to be
oriented this way because the reservoir
has to mount to the radiator so it's
kind of in my opinion a poor design by
the way that this is set up here maybe
it's just supposed to be oriented
horizontally or something but vertically
at least on this side of the case it's
not ideal for an outtake if you will
from the back side of a case so that
will be a bit tricky it's okay though
we'll get through it I also have a 120
in the back we'll figure out what the
heck we're going to do here I want to
have both of the tubes kind of move this
way and that's because there's a bunch
of empty space down here I'm usually
used to putting you know a graphics card
down here as well so it kind of fills in
the gaps and that's the point of having
a custom loop right you want to fill in
the empty space and the PC so to tackle
that issue with the problem only having
110 atti which I'm not complaining but
it's just the space down here I'm going
to take advantage of by just running
piping down here so that's that's going
to be the way that I remedy that and
then I guess from the CPU maybe from
here too
you don't know maybe here to hear how
this one come down across but I don't
know ones maybe just stretch all the way
across and connect both radiators
directly no clue yet we're going to
figure all that out in part two along
with the back plate issue we'll start
wiring everything up I'm also install
the power supply in part two as well
maybe Bend some tubing and maybe even
add some fluid import - I'm not sure and
then part three I guess we can call the
benchmarking parts but I don't know I'm
not going to say definitely what's going
to happen ports two and three because I
don't know if we can run into issues at
this point this is my first time working
with this configuration so I'm
interesting how things work out with
that I hope you enjoyed part one stay
tuned for part two this is science
studio thanks for building with us
you
