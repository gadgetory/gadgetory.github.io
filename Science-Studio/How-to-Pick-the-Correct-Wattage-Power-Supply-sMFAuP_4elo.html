bagels here oh how to pick the correct
wattage power supply this is a tricky
question especially for first-time
builders who might not be familiar with
how power hungry some of their system
components are but I will also say this
once you do select that first power
supplies subsequent PC builds become
much simpler that comes with the
territory you're going to dia for how
power hungry systems are and they can
choose a power supply wattage higher
than that according to a specific buffer
zone which we'll also discuss in this
video so that's what we're going to do
let's talk about power consumption and
how to select the perfect power supply
let's start first with a common
misconception this is something I want
to get out of the way first and foremost
because I see it quite a bit I see
people recommending power supplies based
solely on TD piece now this is a good
way of kind of gauging roughly what your
components will be desiring in terms of
power but it's not just a surefire thing
like if the CPU has a TDP of 91 watts
that does not mean that CPU will only
consume 91 watts in fact if you want to
overclock a CPU you might consume
upwards of 150 watts of power under full
load and even with stock frequencies in
mind sometimes those power spikes do
jump well beyond at 91 Watts TDP stands
for thermal design power and as such
describes the cooler capacity needed to
keep that CPU or GPU or whatever you're
talking about a well within its thermal
limits so you can see how TDP and total
power consumption are somewhat
proportional as you increase total power
draw the heat output must also increase
but there's a small margin there for the
work to be done most of it is lost in
the form of heat because no system is
100% efficient
so in summary adding TDP s is actually
an underestimation of total power draw
it would make no sense for a component
to lose more energy in the form of heat
than it is drawing energy from the wall
that just doesn't add up so we're going
to run through some in general rules of
thumb and then we will talk specifics
first and foremost it is important to
note that the two most power hungry
components in your system will almost
always be your graphics card and your CP
usually in that order so when it comes
to picking a PSU you'll want to refer to
these two first and foremost it makes
sense the base your power supply wattage
unload consumption of course but there
are several scenarios to consider gaming
load editing workload torture load the
list goes on depending on what you do
your power consumption will vary if you
play quite a few video games on a daily
basis you're probably pulling more power
from the wall than if you were editing
on a daily basis usually editing
software if you want to do video editing
photo editing that will usually leverage
your CPU more than anything else but
gaming workloads will leverage CPU and
GPU horsepower in different ways and
usually they're both being used around
5060 percent if the games will optimize
and have a balanced system now a torture
loop is a bit more extreme than a gaming
loop because you're using unrealistic
benchmarks in most cases
to determine how stable your components
actually are so I'll put unrealistic
workloads on your CPU and GPU to ensure
that under the worst-case scenario those
components will be stable at given
frequencies and voltages prime95 is an
excellent example of a CPU torture test
it just adds an unrealistic workload to
the unit itself it's a good indication
of how stable your system is with said
overclock think of it as a worst case
scenario when GPU and CPU usages are
maxed out at 100% which rarely happens
at least both at the same time so a
gaming workload is a pretty safe
underestimation of what your power
supply wattage should be but I also
recommend choosing a wattage higher than
the torture load power supplies can
often supply wattage above a rated
limits ie 750 watts pulled from a 700
watt power supply it is possible but it
isn't recommended for long term use as
transformers and rails can become
extremely hot so there is a surefire way
of determining how much power your build
will pull from the wall under any given
workload use a watt meter stick it
between the outlet and the power supply
and boom that's how much power your
system is pulling under any given load
but keep in mind that some of that power
will be lost due to the inefficiencies
of the power supply itself so somewhere
between 80 and 90% of that in most cases
is actually being used by the computer
but the problem with that of course is
that you need the computer built
beforehand so how would you know what
power supply to use in a build if you
have to have the PC built before you can
determine how much power it's pulling
from the wall that contradiction is why
I recommend a site like Tom's Hardware I
trust their reviews 100% and all of
their power supply investigations all of
their different component power
consumption graphs are super helpful for
first-time builders I've linked their
site in this video's description take
this one for example this graph depicts
CPU torture test power consumptions
we've got the rise in seven CPUs here
the Intel Core i7 7700 K and a few other
hungry counterparts I recommend starting
here or at a graph similar to this one
for your CPU of choice just Google
something along the lines of Tom's
Hardware horizon 5 1600 X power
consumption just to insert your CP or
GPU of choice and that's the beauty of
their testing they've tested and
compared almost every mainstream
component on the market so if for
example your CPU GPU combo is arisin 5
1600 gtx 1070 search for both of these
graphs similar to this one
and add them up in the case of this
example roughly 90 watts + 170 watts for
sum of 260 this is a very low figure
however and it would be unwise to shove
a 260 watt power supply into this system
several factors should be accounted for
including overclock ability whether or
not the graphics card is referenced or
AIB and how many other components are
peripherals are in the system addressing
overclock ability first this is a
slippery slope generally speaking over
clocks tend to drastically increase
power consumption so 5% initial
frequency overclock might increase power
consumption by 5 percent followed by 10
percent for the next five percent
overclock followed by 20 percent for the
next 5 percent of the clog and so on CC
outs they're not directly related
they're not linear by any means so the i
970 900 X that was a notorious power hog
but lower core count chips will usually
manage power in a much more civil manner
and that's what most consumers will go
after something like a 2 4 or 6 core CPU
so it really depends on what you're
sporting in your rig and what your
overclock or intended overclock is but
as a general rule of thumb I recommend
at least a 50% load power consumption
buffer for your CPU unless your
reference is already showing overclocked
consumption so for our example multiply
90 watts by 1.5 for a 135 watt
overclocked torture workload following
suit then our 1600 X 1700 combo now has
a power buffer of 135 watts + 265 for a
400 watt total power consumption this is
a pretty bare-bones recommendation but
I'd be willing to bet my lunch money
that a proper 400 watt PS you could
handle this combo in a full system is it
recommended though no absolutely not
unless your power supply is 100%
efficient which is impossible higher
power demand will result in more of it
lost in the form of heat which explains
why power supplies get hotter and louder
under load so it's a safe practice to
include an additional buffer I swear by
50% but you're free to throw in
something higher I recommend higher
don't go much lower than that for a 400
watt calculation like ours a 50%
additional buffer zone yield 600 watts
which should also account for hardened
solid state drives LEDs peripherals and
fans most of these smaller components
usually won't consume but a few watts
each so if you put together a system
like this
one here which I would consider well
balanced it's linked in the video
description by the way a 600 watt power
supply it with a solid efficiency rating
from a reputable brand would put you in
a great position your supply should stay
rather quiet if it's built well and
sharp power spikes shouldn't trip your
system feel free to apply this rule
across the spectrum by the way
introducing a second CPU which would be
weird for a gaming system or a second
graphics card which I imagine most
consumers would be more interested in
would only require that you repeat the
affirmation process just one more time
for said component I will say though if
you're going to SLI or crossfire two
graphics cards you don't just multiply
the original load power consumption for
the single card by - that's not how
those configurations work actually SLI
and crossfire are pretty inefficient
when you want to look it from a power
consumption standpoint so if one cards
consuming 200 watts under full load and
you stick a second card the exact same
one in there you're not going to have a
400 watt load in fact you might have
something along the lines of a 300 or
350 watt load and that's under like a
best-case scenario so really if you add
a second graphics card you don't even
really have to add that 50% buffer it
could be something lower just keep in
mind like don't be surprised if your
system is not really pulling that much
more from the wall if you add a second
card for most builds with a single
graphics card and CPU it will be
perfectly fine on a 6 to 800 watt power
supply I would say upward towards 800
watt would be well within your safe zone
you could even upgrade at a second
graphics card and still be ok
generally the more expensive the
components inside though the higher the
wattage should be again just for peace
of mind wouldn't make much sense to pair
a $40 PSU with a $1,500 system while in
many cases your system would run
perfectly fine as I've proven in this
video right here it's just not good
practice to pair an ultra cheap power
supply it with an ultra expensive
computer even if your computer isn't
that expensive you would really hate
yourself if your power supply took your
entire system with it because you
decided to cheap out on the one
component that you should not have a
simple analogy don't pair a 600
horsepower Ferrari with a set of $20
tires that you picked up at a junkyard
makes no sense if you liked this video
