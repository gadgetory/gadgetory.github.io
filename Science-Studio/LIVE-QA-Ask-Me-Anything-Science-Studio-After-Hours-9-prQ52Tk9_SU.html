there we go there we go
how's that say I'm not gonna know for
the next 20 seconds until you guys
actually get this yeah I know there's no
audio folks I literally said that in the
chat I'll wait for you guys to pick this
up I want to make sure that I'm not
blowing your eardrums out I view this no
I don't think I'm gonna fix it and I'm
just gonna I'm just gonna talk and in
like a mute fashion that should be
perfect
welcome to noob studio thanks trucker I
appreciate it thanks for the love
alright I am I'm glad that the audio is
there now I apologize if the audio Peaks
randomly I've noticed that you guys have
pointed it out and I assume that it was
just me moving closer and further from
the mic but I'm pretty sure it's
auto-leveling but I don't have anything
set by default in stream labs for that
and my sound board is there's nothing
you know to do won't sell on the table
over that so I'm not sure what's going
on with that but I am here to answer all
of your beautiful questions so if you
have a question that you would like to
ask and now would be the time to do so
I also would like to invite you guys to
have an open discussion in the chat
section about stuff that just entertains
you you know stuff that doesn't
necessarily have to do what we're
talking about it you know at that
certain point in time we can certainly
change subjects and then go back to what
we were talking about previously I want
this to be an open discussion that's why
I do these live streams I have fun with
these and I have fun interacting with
you guys it's just a way to be more
personal so I appreciate all of you
again watching means a lot to me that
y'all are willing to take time out of
your sunday night to do that or Monday
morning depending on where you are
what's going on the greatness preciate
that $2 super chat thank you he says hey
I'm back
Mega Man X 992 subscribe you guys like
my animations I think they're pretty
they're pretty dope I mean come on it's
crash who doesn't like crash bandicoot
let's see mashed potatoes asks is 90
degrees C okay on
ddr2 on ddr2 ECC Ram I'm not sure about
those RAM modules or those modules in
particular but yeah ECC Ram will run
really hot and it's recommended that you
have some sort of active cooling unit
put a fan over those dims or you know do
something that will keep them cool
because they get extremely hot and when
I was a new back when I just started
building stuff like this kind of more
in-depth I didn't know the ECC Ram got
that hot so don't be afraid just make
sure you get something at least
passively cooling it but that is
something that I didn't know about a
while back that uh it's just the nature
of the RAM I would like to do more
research into why it gets so hot I'm
curious now this sounds like a really
cool minute science video yeah look at
that James says crash is it since ps1
that is what ah all right we got Brent
Vance ruinberg question he asks on oh I
see this year is it okay to run a i/o
pump on a fan curve PWM or volts fractal
s24 okay so it's actually pretty
interesting question in my testing it's
better for a pump to just run it at a
like a standard rpm I'm not you know I
haven't run a pump for five years to
figure out if it's going to last five
years running you know with a curve or
just running at a flat rpm the way I see
it keep your pump at like a set rpm
you're gonna be perfectly fine there and
most of the time for these smaller ASA
tech pumps and the like you're gonna
want to keep the pump rpm around the
medium setting I'd say around 5060
percent you could max it out it won't
really do you any harm but the argument
between having a slow pump versus a
really strong pump it pretty much
neutralized each other because if you
have a weaker pump right the fluid
spends more time in the radiator you
have a stronger pump it doesn't spend as
much time over the CPU block or whatever
you're trying to cool so there's an up
and down there no but I would say you
know keep it just pick an RPM that
you're comfortable with audio wise make
sure your temp starts spiking and your
pumps should be strong and of course
feed you know turn your pump down to too
far then you're gonna have some serious
thermal issues so you'll figure it out
you'll get that nice comfort zone and
just keep it flat that's what I do I
don't throw a fan curve on it it just
it's not good for the pump to change
RPMs kind of like on demand like
especially if you're doing a lot of
workloads or have
your CPU get really hot and then that
could cool and then hot again and then
back cool that's a lot of stress on that
on that pump that's used to just running
at a flat-out rpm
bazinga xing is that $5 donation thank
you for that what do you think of the
samson 49 inch widescreen for general
gameplay over at etc i think it's too
wide I'm pretty sure you mean Samsung
but I I don't like how wide it is I
think it's a little little too much you
know if you ask me I'm just not into
that ultra ultra wide form factor yeah
it's a little hardcore yes yes you guys
feel me really all right all right
someone asks mister razor says a gamax
GT on a on an 80 700 K it's a good
question I have that I actually have
that cooler and I have thrown it onto an
80 400 and it cools beautifully it's
also fairly quiet which is a great thing
on an 80 700 km I sure depends on your
overclock you want to reach a high
frequency a year and I have a bit of a
problem there truck a bomb did I like
your shirt of course I liked your shirt
I called you out on 24 I love your shirt
he like took our logo and then just
straight up like made a shirt with it
it's pretty dope actually make it look a
little smaller next time though it needs
to be less it's just not as subtle as I
might like it if I was designing it
myself
we have techno nerds are there any new
series in the works for your channel not
too sure it I want to get something
gonna spice it up you know because we've
been doing the same thing for just just
its minute science right then there's
some crash course kind of worked in
there and that's basically it
you know and then we do have our general
benchmarking videos and the videos where
I kind of talked about like the trends
and and people's reactions and stuff and
the Craigslist videos I think the I read
playlist is a really unique one on our
channel even though it really doesn't
have much to do with science there's
still something you can learn from some
of these ads especially on Craigslist
sometimes I just read hate comments just
to do it because it's entertaining it's
just a way to lighten the mood and
people take things so seriously and
personally but I think I think we're
gonna try to do something at least open
up one new playlist here soon I'm I'm
more or less waiting though
for a couple things to fall in line we
have Computex coming up we're gonna be
gone for that for a while I'll be in
Germany with Lisa for a week before and
then a week after and so we're gonna do
a lot of traveling and we running doing
a lot of things that are out of the box
anyway for the channel tech stores you
know when we do stuff like that so
that's already gonna be a change big
time then when we come back in June I
think we're gonna try to kick things off
a little differently we're gonna give
the the channel a big makeover and just
try to I don't know vamp up the the
entertainment value a little bit you
know like get you guys more into this
stuff we're doing on like more personal
basis when I do more things like this I
want interact more with the patrons
patreon donors on discord I want to do
live streams strictly for them by the
way if you are a patreon supporter I
invite you to hop into the discord right
now if you can and ask your question on
discord
I will give you guys priority you guys
don't need to throw money at me or
anything like that to get me to answer a
question if you want my attention you
guys already support us so just ask a
question on there and I will do my best
to get to it as soon as possible I
appreciate you guys supporting on there
okay so getting over to come on out we
got another one from the greatness of a
ten-dollar my dude all right so he has
$1,000 to upgrade these parts and he
suggests ins we got a 7700 K he's got a
good motherboard with it 1080 TI m dot 2
2 terabyte hard drive 16 gigs of ram 750
watt power supply what are you gaming at
right now what's your gaming resolution
do you want to stream do you want to
content create what's your what's your
path I need to know more than this
because right now your system is fine
you're in the top five 10% of pcs out
there so unless you just want to brag
right here which okay I'd say you're
already in a comfort zone unless you
want to do again some more multitasking
work loaded stuff I would say read
Ripper is a pretty good route just
budget wise again though that's gonna
cost you more than just $1,000 on the
CPU on the platform in total let's see I
see a trucker bomb yeah it should be I
would say 1/4 as large as the Hat just
make it subtle you know something small
like a logo on a t-shirt you know
normally looks I think you're finding
the greatness where you are let's see
here Jonah games
Jonah games I say that right what's s ck
what is that I feel like I should sound
the style see I don't even know try
thanks for the donation can you
overclock 2600 ram to 2900 +4 risin 7
2600 ram 4 risin 7 which rise instead I
need to know specifically tries I'm
talking about you talk about rising
horizon + and are you talking about
twenty-six hundred megahertz ram to 2900
+ it depends if you're talking my rising
+ then yeah you could probably get that
you might have to bump your timings up
though which most of the time they they
level out overclocking Ram is in my
opinion a pointless endeavor because
you're always going to compromise
somewhere and look all of these dies are
bend any way like this you know that the
manufacturers of these these DIMMs know
exactly what frequency and what timings
work out perfect and I wouldn't really
tinker with those too much it's just not
really worth it I'm scrolling down here
I see you guys I see you something about
a chainsaw gaming what type of coolant
do you recommend I use for my first
custom loop I want to go with white
fluid but I don't know if it will mess
up my blocks well I'll tell you this any
fluid that's not clear will likely clog
your blocks within the first three or
four months and if even if you've done
like the most intense scrubbing of your
radiators if you've just like you know
acid washed everything and made sure
that your tubes were perfectly clean and
that your pump was spotless all of that
still will result in some kind of gunk
build up with an opaque fluid I'm
running white fluid right now in the
winter build and I can already see the
CPU block starting to clog up and that's
after like what two weeks and I cleaned
everything I made it spotless so you're
you're just gonna have to assume you
know a heavy maintenance workload when
it comes to throwing fluid that's not
clear into a loop and even if it's clear
you know even if it's transparent
you're still gonna probably have some
buildup of sediments and residue and the
radiators you might have some kind of
growth accumulate over time you'll have
things anodized it's just a No
it's kind of kind of a mess but it's a
fun mess because it's like your baby
it's your artwork and you're just
maintaining your artwork that's how I
see it
excuse me okay I see a white monster
with an X in the front X in the middle
and X at the end how do you feel on
Linus's video about deleting a cpu and
putting the cooler directly on the cpu
okay so I don't know about what Linus
did with this I didn't see that video
but I do know that derp power who I've I
met at CES this year he was kind of like
the co builder of the leanly dynamic
case he actually sells a d-link it for I
don't know if he sells it for just X
$2.99 but I know that for those chips in
particular he has a kit where you can
pull off that IHS and then just strap a
cooler directly onto the of the die
which is much more efficient especially
when comes to Intel CPUs because they
don't you slip the nicest Tim right the
thermal interface between the die and
the IHS Saudi living has its place
especially in the enthusiast space I
would say for 90% of you it's not going
to matter getting an extra 2 or 300
megahertz or that you know 10 degree
drop that might be more worth it to you
but I've never had a need personally to
deal with I think would be cool to do as
an experiment to show you guys on the
channel but I've never personally felt
the need to do it you know like I don't
feel like I need D lid so just something
to keep in mind it's definitely a
enthusiast thing excuse me all right
right and is that right and light man
I think it's right and let's go with
that I feel like your fanboy video
didn't touch enough on the fact that
backwards compatibility doesn't exist
with Intel and that you'd be upgrading
not building all brand new if you put a
2000 series I'm confused
I'm pretty confused there with KB Lake
it was the same story with Kaiba Lake
you had to have a skylake motherboard
with an updated BIOS right in order to
be able to run these CPUs almost
confident that was the case it's been
this case for a long time and not just
on AMD side and tell us had the same
exact thing go on in the past
back in Florida she's four or five
generations off the top of my head I'm
not sure about any further than that but
I know that they had backwards
compatibility this is not just an AMD
isolated thing and I'm just pointing out
I pointed out in that video that if he's
going to point out that AMD you know is
doing this to consumers and that's why
you shouldn't buy AMD he's being
hypocritical because Intel did the exact
same thing with a KB leak launch you had
to have a skylake CPU right or you had
to have basically the old platform set
up already with an updated BIOS by the
time KB like rolled out in order to use
that chip on the existing platform
that's that's exactly what I said in the
video so I'm not sure what you're
referring to there Stephen Acker what
would the specs of your first custom PC
build Stephen type in blue sky custom
loop science studio on YouTube and
you'll get to watch the four part series
all the specs are in there I don't want
to go through list and everything let's
see it's a bonus that you can even pop a
2000 series CPU and actually yeah
exactly and Dillon that's what I said I
said in the video like we should be
thankful it's a blessing that we can do
that because you know you shouldn't
expect 12 nanometer nodes to work on a
14 nanometer chipset writer chips that
this is Ryan around a different process
because this is while it's a refresh in
the sense that the architecture
architectural layout on the you know
when it comes to how things are
structured internally within the die
aren't very different the process is
still different and this required you
know entirely new wafer manufacturers
everything has had changed so the fact
that we can still use these chip sets on
the new technology when these chipsets
were you know being developed years
before this technology ever came into
existence is a blessing it really is
chip wheel I don't know his name starts
with ch ch will my eyes itch ins scuse
me is it possible to have a too much of
a oh no too small of a radiator for the
heat load your system is producing it
sure is if you put a 120 mil rad into a
system with 210 ATT eyes and a
it's picking outrageous cpu let's do the
79 80 XE then a single 120 mil rad is
not going to cut it your fans will be
running full blast and even then you
have the down clock or your components
will thermal throttle because there's no
way a 120 mile rad will be able to
dissipate that much heat even with a fan
at full speed with those three equipped
so yeah there's definitely a point at
which you have too few radiators or just
too little radiator surface area ah
let's see here
it's Slendy says please read this can
you look up the trace 930 and see if the
price is good trace 930 like I'm being
trolled iBUYPOWER trace 930 okay let's
see oh I tell you what let's go ahead
and pull this up on the big screen I'm
gonna switch to is that gonna work all
right whatever it looks really trashy
but you guys get it we have here okay
ACH 110 plus a data 20 this is oddly
vague oh no that's I want the actual
specs why am I on the review page was
weird anyway okay we have why is it so
difficult to find this crap 7700 log 16
gigs of ram 1tb hard drive 120k SSD 1060
ballpark I would say around in this
market a hundred to a thousand bucks
thousand bucks being the high end which
I would feel probably a little
uncomfortable they want $1,200 for it is
a little too much you're only gonna need
10 60 in there and just on principle
like you could build this system you
know a year ago for you know 800 bucks
maybe you get a 10 70 for sure and a
system price like this a year ago so I
think this is just a little too
expensive I wouldn't I wouldn't buy it
that's just my take though
let's see bazinga X I see that ten
dollar donation thank you Mon dude
what gaming chair would you recommend
for a large man 300-plus pounds yes I
know I need to lose weight but for now
looking for a new chair I appreciate the
honesty and look you need to lose a few
pounds I need to gain a few pounds okay
so we're on the same boat just opposite
ends of it I am going to let's see well
look this up because my goat ears always
Verde gear look to date I haven't taken
a dime from vertigo but I love their
stuff
and I always ask for more of it and I've
had multiple gaming chairs from multiple
companies I'm pretty sure the PL 6000 or
the SL 5000 prefer two gears gonna be
pretty sweet for you and these chairs
aren't gonna crush you right so the
chair I'm in now honestly barely fits me
like the the supports here on the side
pop out enough to where and they're
narrow enough to where I fit almost
perfectly in it I'll have a really wide
frame but for somebody's 300
you're gonna probably want something
that's maybe one and a half times this
wide or you know if you want to be
really comfortable two times as wide but
that Sherry's gonna look really odd so
what they tend to do is just reduce the
support on the side so doesn't cut into
your into your into your waist or to the
sides of you and you just want to share
that has a bit more flexibility and it's
a bit softer in general if you're a
bigger person I recommend the verdict
year SL 5000 or the pl 6,000 I would
look into those first I just always go
to vertigo because I've loved their
stuff since the beginning and hopefully
yeah hopefully the one that you get
actually fits for you but hey if it
doesn't if it's like just you know like
a tight squeeze for motivation just get
out there and lose some weight
just just run and drop carbs that's what
I would do I'd be the first thing I did
the greatness another $5 my Duke would
it be worth it to upgrade from a 7700 K
to 8700 K also you missed my previous
don't owe me see I'm scrolling down here
I don't see
we're trying to get into content
creation of 4k gaming 4k gaming your CPU
is not going to matter at all if you
want 4k gaming bump up your graphics
card get a second 1080i for streaming
and content creation 8700 K is gonna be
really good for that I'm gonna say 8700
K and 2 1080p is gonna be fine if you if
you really have a hole in your pocket
but you could give out 4k gaming on your
current setup I also saw a donation from
it's a Canadian alright Canadian $5 what
is that like one dollar numbers mess of
money it probably is the currency is
really weird hey Greg first time first
timer on your stream this is from
executer I dunno I think I said that
right first time on the stream here my
queue is about my newly purchased arise
in five fifteen hundred Windows 7 x64
update says my CPU is not supported how
do I fix this
that's that's weird so how are you
booting in your system if your CP is not
supported I feel like there's a certain
software in Windows 7 that's messing
with that otherwise I don't know I don't
know if Windows 7 is still support is
supported even though I'm non Rison I've
never used Windows 7 in the past two or
three years so that is a question I
think Google will my friend and I hate
to tell you that because you gave me
money but I'm not as familiar Windows 7
I'm sure somebody in the chat knows is
Windows 7 still supported by horizon or
vice versa does Rison 5 support Windows
7 I think someone in the chat will know
keep a lookout for that I'm scrolling
through here what am I seeing
I see one from Papa Ivan Java Novik for
gaming 2600 X or i-580 600 K with a gtx
1060 ivan if you're just gaming i 5 i
think you know the answer to that it's
it's the i-5 if you're just gonna
strictly game the occupies gonna give
you a higher framerate in almost every
single scenario but if you want to do
more than just gaming this is something
we've all said like every tech tuber
said this then go with horizon get this
better work it's a it's a well rounded
cpu and it's a great value for what it
is Travis Henry all middle all
elementary and middle schools
the high-school all used Windows 10 VMs
from one server 500 plus computers has
like 64 gigs of RAM ouch and a single
Xeon ten core 2.4 gig so I assume you're
splitting like a tenth of a core on like
a good day in your school that's
terrible and like you're getting like
what five hundred megabytes of RAM at
your disposal that is so painful I'm
really curious now when I was in high
school what we were while we were
running on they were all servers or they
were all running off the servers but I
really wonder I mean these were legit
pcs though it was more or less like the
data networking thing that was all
server wearing it but for vm's
that's really rough I know we'll there's
a lot of stuff with VNC has a ton of
servers and he always tries to allocate
at least I think to these two gigabytes
of RAM for a storage server you might
you don't even really need that I think
Windows requires two gigs but and then
you know couples eons or whatever and
you can give each VM two cores or
something along those lines but that's
that's really taking it to an extreme
there I'm not as familiar with servers
as you can tell but I do know the basics
of how to split up resources on virtual
machines and that's pretty out and Jerry
Jenkins asks how often I'll be doing
live streams every Sunday my dude if you
go back on this playlist check out the
After Hours playlist every Sunday where
there's not some kind of like holiday in
the States or I don't make an
announcement right we'll be doing it
every Sunday Thea with those exceptions
scrolling down here pop NIM pop what's
going on my dude $1 $0.99 donation did
you do any benchmarks on ABC Mouse net
yet not yet not yet I will do I will
Blake fast fast fast no last name oh
well you do a review of the Dell XPS 13
92 70 and XPS start no I I won't cuz I
have to go buy them myself Dell doesn't
send me any of that stuff so unless I
get one from somebody yeah I would do it
on the loaner but I don't even get
loaners from people so I no not unless
someone sends me one Matt Kyle Matt you
know you have two first names right
Matt Kyle I've never seen the last name
Kyle before let's not your last name it
might be a middle name a few of the
computers and my work are still using XP
Alex yeah my school used XP for the
longest time that said though this was
back in like 2010 right so XP was that
was still the hot bang at least in
schools I see somebody says hey Greg
let's see this is frenzy Klan hey Greg
my birthday is coming up soon I wanted
to know some peripherals I should yet
you have any suggestions
I think Corsair stuffs really good
coolermaster stuffs gonna be in general
a bit cheaper but still great quality
stuff for what it is so if you want
something that's a little cheaper I
think course a cooler master's way to go
of course there I think is a bit more
premium in most cases if you want to go
like altra high-end stuff or just like
you know name-brand stuff that a lot of
people who don't know what Corsair is
well recognized you could go with Frazer
stuff we have a Razer Kraken 7.1 here I
use it on this PC actually Lisa uses I
bought it for her and then I have
another course their headset that's
under NDA that you guys will see very
soon I love that headset from Corsair -
much better than the void Pro in my
opinion I see Tyler Patton here hey Greg
would you be interested to learn that
prolonged fasting can actually increase
your HGH levels if you're trying to bulk
up hmm interesting I find that very hard
to believe
mainly because I have gone several days
without eating before not because I I
mean I've eaten stopped but like not a
lot of stuff just because I've been
traveling and I definitely lose weight
so I don't see where the cutting back on
food increases HGH because muscle
requires protein synthesis and the only
way to synthesize proteins is to eat
foods that have necessary amino acids so
that's a little little weird
Michael Matti 299 I think that's
Australian dollar I appreciate that
best slash worst opaque coolants you've
ever used I've used about three three or
so opaque coolants the worst one was the
C 1000 was a Thermaltake C 1000 blue
coolant that was blue opaque that was my
first build ever and it actually stained
the tubes it was so so bad I did tear
apart
entire build they're really cool about
it they offered to replace everything I
thought it's not a big deal just some
more tubing and I'll clean out the
blocks and whatnot
so that was my worst experience but I'm
using actually right now
primo chill stuff it's primo chill it's
like I know it's one of those opaque
concentrates I forget what they call it
but it comes in a little pack comes with
a little treat or if you want to treat
your loot beforehand no I mean that
stuff that's pretty good it still clogs
the loop but nowhere near as quickly so
Thermaltake stuff did and then I also
use some opaque stuff from alpha cool
it's kind of in the middle it's still
clogged but again nowhere near as
quickly as Thermaltake stood so the best
I'll pick stuff I've used is primo chill
stuff I haven't used the view yet so I
don't want to comment on view although
it doesn't look too great and I haven't
used what's what's the other one from
trying to think it's not its view and
then what's the other one that has the
Aurora Aurora from geez I should know
this whichever company online makes
Aurora mayhem at mayhem yeah yeah it's a
it's a Mayhem's die and that's also kind
of like a metallic looking fluid and I
hear that's not great either so yeah
Opaques are always a little risky Bath's
three I think if it a five dollar
donation
whenever I boot my PC into Windows 10 my
disk is maxed out and I have to give it
about five minutes to go before I can
use it is it a hard drive because if
it's hard drive that makes sense
pardon my very childish country accent
won't even call that
any idea why if it's a hard drive I can
tell you that you probably have like 10
or so programs at least starting up as
Windows starts up hit control-alt-delete
and go over to startup the startup tab
assuming yeah you're in Windows 10 click
the startup tab check how many programs
you got starting up immediately like
right away if they're enabled and then
it will tell you kind of like the the
burden that each of those programs has
on the ability for your system to boot
up quickly hard drives in general
require a minute or two to finally
initialize all the startup programs
before you can start using the
I had it be very fluid that's just my
experience there so if you have an HDD
that's exactly what's causing it and you
probably have a lot of startup programs
slowing it down in the beginning bilinga
X about my dude so you feel that verdict
years better than dxracer just asking is
I do not know I've never used dxracer
so I don't know I just know I'm really
happy with verdaguer so I can't comment
on dxracer III have no feelings about
them because I've never used them before
I think they've I think they've reached
out once or twice but by this point I
was already satisfied with the stuff I
had inverted urine I didn't want to jump
ship you know they're a really cool
company I appreciate companies that
respond quickly you know companies that
don't lead you on and like well let me
get back to you on this and then two
weeks later you got to go back to them
and say hey you told me you would get
back to me on this it's been like half a
month you know what's going on and like
oh we're stolen talks about it let's get
back to you another week and they just
keep dragging you on and on and then
after a month they come back to you say
sorry we don't want to work with you
it's like you could have just told me
that in the beginning oh that's all you
had to say it was just we don't want to
work with you I would have taken it
personally it's all business and there's
moving on but of course you don't have
that in today's day and age everyone's
got a you know sugarcoat everything and
just just prolong the inevitable and I
don't I don't like that at all so
vertigo is one of those companies where
I have a really great experience not
only with their PR and marketing teams
but also just on the consumer side I
like how they engage with fans I like
how NZXT does this as well especially on
Twitter and ZX he's very active on
Twitter and I like seeing companies do
that fractal designs that way Corsairs
that way companies that are very public
like that don't really have a veil to
hide behind are the ones that die trusts
because they're just open you know if
they have if if customers message them
on Twitter or elsewhere and have a
problem they say hey go to this contact
form you know submit a ticket we'll look
for you the same day and if not look you
can go back to that tweet right and say
hey I sent this I haven't got a reply
yet and then it's public so they're not
afraid right of that interaction because
if it's public they're gonna get on top
of it they don't wanna look bad about
like so it's kind of like a check and
balance if you will but that's why I
like Verde guerre I like companies like
that and verdict your products are great
I have no
thing bad to save other products
squirrel hoon Joe Owen says do you still
like apple yes sir I used my iPhone
still it's an SC I like iPhones that are
smaller just phones in general that are
smaller I don't like the huge phones I
have a LG v 30 epic phone it's like
twice as powerful assisting and linked
almost every task out there but it is
too big I just don't like having to use
two two hands right to reach on top of
the screen I can't do that with one hand
because the screen so dang big um so I
like smaller and more compact phones and
the SC's perfect cuz it's fast enough
good enough camera you get FaceTime
iMessage I can use all that with my
macbook MacBooks great too blazing Apple
hey Greg what's your favorite Windows OS
that would be Windows 8 I'm just kidding
windows 8 was trashed
look windows 10 isn't that bad I mean I
know Windows 10 has some security issues
you know personal data and tracking
location Cortana is literally cancer but
Windows tens honestly not that bad by
comparison if the massive improvement
over Windows 8 and I think that's why
I'm kind of saying that but I would take
in this order I would take probably
Windows XP and then Windows 10 and then
Windows Vista that would be what I would
yeah that would be I think Vista was
just like a side grade really from eggs
from XP I yeah I don't know I don't want
get too far into it but in my experience
I've had the best luck with XP and then
Windows 10 like has I've been using
Windows 10 probably longest amount of
time tracker ball in favorite case to
build in I literally answer that
question like three videos ago my new
favorite case is the dynamic from lean
lean the OU 11 it is a beautiful case so
much space and it is very very
strategically priced at a hundred two
hundred and thirty bucks mmm let's see
Cameron Johansson asked what's the max
height for the side rad on the dynamic
look all I know is my 360 mil rad from
primo chill it's perfect there's like no
give on the top or bottom it is slated
perfectly for a single 360 mil rad if
you have a rad that has like ports on
the top and bot
might be a problem I don't think that's
gonna fit and be honest with you yeah if
it fits it's gonna fit with like a
millimeter to spare so I wouldn't push
it with a double ported rad I would just
stick to you know a rad that has ports
on top if you're going with a 360 and
honestly a single 360 like that looks
perfect cuz it fits perfectly in that
frame okay scrolling down here but but
but the bus girl one down his someone
says my hair seriously looks amazing and
I dude I literally got out of shower and
I just did this once with my hair the
wrong way this way and I just called it
a day you know sometimes it's just not
worth dealing with I appreciate the
compliment but I didn't expect that you
go viana science studio since that is
and since since that is no one could
since that is no one do it could could
you do a comparison of new rise ins with
the Intel counterpart with a rx Vega GPU
I mean yeah I guess I could I have Vega
64 the the the loop of the a IO graphics
card I could probably put together
something like that I want to finish my
i-5 sr5 benchmarks though this one these
are taking a while because I'm running
three different platforms in three
different form factors just to give you
guys kind of a unique perspective
because they're already like generally
you know are five hours i-5 videos out
there for the new stuff so I don't want
to do the same thing on it's like a case
scenario alright so I'm gonna do an ITX
bill I'll just go and tell you guys
because I appreciate ya'll watching I'll
give you the inside scoop so in a
nutshell what I have here is an ITX
build I'm gonna work I'm gonna be a
special bill dedicated videos I'm just
building it because I think you guys
really don't like it so we have an i5
build and then we're gonna have an r5
2600 build it's actually 2600 X but for
all intents and purposes of 2600 because
I'm sure the overclock roughly the same
if it was anything like horizon 1 summit
ridge and then we're going to have an i5
8400 build which is going to be using a
motherboard that's like identical right
they're both white PCB boards if you
follow me on Instagram or Twitter then
you guys have already seen both of those
I use those already too
mark with I'm putting together your I
580 600 K build now with you know a
small little ITX cooler to kind of give
you like alright well if you want a
small form-factor
ITX build what do you get for that
versus the full-size are five point six
hundred versus a full-size i-5 8400 just
something different and give you guys
some more like I said user case scenario
where all variables are not the same
because that's generally how it is now
tar oh good good Tara's good theater
s-sorry about that Greg what do you
think of star citizen never even played
it I've heard it once but that's all I
can tell you what's up hardcore hardware
do you like memes Ricky B yes I do
really I like memes a lot if you like
memes enough to pay me a dollar a month
you can send memes all you want on
discord I would be thrilled because I
love I love memes oh yeah look I there
are some memes out there that are pretty
inappropriate you know if some of them
are like racial someone more sexist some
oh look there's a meme for everything
out there okay I don't take offense to
mostly anything unless it's just
straight-up distasteful and wrong or
sick that's their boundary for me
they're all doing like that on there but
if it's like you know edgy don't care
how fine
you know you're always gonna find
somebody out there who gets offended by
something I am unless you're like making
it your your mission to offend somebody
be a meme I don't I don't care
so yeah throw them are away on discord
if you're up for it it would be lovely
bask you three think of that another $2
donation you can only play one game from
now on which game you know it's got to
be it's gotta be
this one's tough it's a it's a it's a
tie between it's a tie
yeah it's a tie between I can't answer
this question this one sucks this is
really tough I don't even want to answer
um I don't want to answer City skylines
is really great and you can do a lot
with it so City skylines is probably
gonna be my answer because it's never
the same thing I don't want to pick up
can pan game bigger campaign game
because when I do that then I can you
play the game once and you're done
so from now on it have to be a
simulation game something you can you
know try different things every time and
it'll still be enjoyable that's what I
think I would do so between city
skylines and probably like planet
coaster which is like the new roller
coaster tycoon game okay you know I'm
scribbling down now well a row up hello
Salazar I build a system a few months
ago but after connecting a PCI to PCI
adapter the mobo and processor fried the
aftermath for the PSU doesn't seem bad
and I tested what do you think you could
have had I mean that riser cable PCI to
PCI II adapter PCI you're talking about
like old-school PCI I don't know if you
mean like a riser cable or if you're
talking about like an old like just I'm
kind of confused here but I'll assume
they actually have these two they have
this is really funny they've owned of
those really old-school PCI to PCI
adapters for forty bucks that is so
strange
Oh what good that would do you I mean it
gives you the obviously support for PCI
Hardware but I mean they at what what
lanes we running here I don't know
enough about this it's one lane Wow
anyway depending on which we were
talking about and I would assume that
that little bridge there short-circuited
here I'll go ahead and show you guys the
screen if you're curious this is uh this
is what we're talking about here so this
like old-school us the old-school PCIe
they're not PCI a bit old-school PCI on
the bottom and then a PCIe little bridge
up top I'm sure I'm not sure if that's
what he's talking about but anyhow that
would be quite unfortunate if that
happened to me how do you really pissed
but how you really gonna prove that
right unless you have like a visual cue
that's something on that little bridge
there fried rated R for life the five
dollar Canadian domination thank you for
the super chat worth upgrading from the
s340
elite white to the mainly PC level
dynamic white depends I mean if you're
dissatisfied with your current look sure
and you could probably sell yes before
you lead for 50 60 bucks you know if
it's in good condition so if you want a
new look yeah sure and if you got white
components I think the PCO level
dynamics gonna look great it's you just
gotta make sure you have a hardware to
fill it out I wouldn't go with the do
lemma dynamic unless you have you know
at least a triple rad and a ton of fans
to fill up the empty space or if you
want to do a custom loop in it that
would be a different story as well Eric
Adams love the channel Greg keep up the
good work thank you Mudd dude I
appreciate that thank you for watching
excuse me alright here I just missed a
lot of stuff um let's see here hi Greg
will you do an X 58 build in the future
maybe I I don't really have plans to do
anything really crazy an old school like
that I mean there there's a time and a
place for that I just dont plan that far
ahead
honestly how do you know if you're a i/o
pump is bad doctor you'll hear it or you
won't hear it those are the two cues so
if you hear that your pump is like
making some really strange noises it's
probably gonna probably a bearing that's
blown or it's yeah probably have just a
bad bearing at which point eventually
we'll fry the motor and if you don't
hear it at all and the pump is
completely dead and you are not going to
enjoy
those temperatures after a while once
that fluid heats up you're not gonna
have to write that cycle of water so
your water's gonna be really hot on once
that ear loop and then your rad just
going to be dissipating basically
ambient temperature right room
temperature err on the cool side of that
loop through your radiator fins so
you'll know either by temps or by how
loud it is or how not live does if it's
silent pumped fortnight yo Greg love you
bro
quick question risin 5 1600 plus GT x 10
63 gig combo good for any game 1080p
medium settings while streaming if yoy
your stream settings are gonna have to
be pretty wise the the 1600 could handle
streaming well the frame rates really
what holds it back but you have the
thread to kind of punch through that I
would keep your I would keep your
bitrate around 4 or 3 I don't know I'd
up it it's more of a case thing now your
1063 gig is gonna be ok for 1080p
streaming or 1080p gaming excuse me
there's gonna be more or less a CPU
dependent resolution so your CP is gonna
be handling more of the workload and
1080p no matter what I think and
probably about half your titles
depending on the game you should be ok
but you're gonna have to adjust settings
you might have to drop some below medium
depending on the title scrolling down
here I am scrolling down here Megan
Smith hi Greg and this is going back a
while but how did you find the temps in
P 400 excuse me with the fans behind the
front panel I'm thinking about doing a
water loop in 1 temps were okay they
weren't great it's not the most friendly
case when it comes to cooling because
that p400 panel is basically blocked off
and you have a little vent up top and a
small one at the bottom as well it's
borderline for a custom loop I wouldn't
recommend that be your first case if you
really like the case you'll be ok it
might be a little louder they're gonna
lose air pressure when you fans you know
when the air that you're pulling in your
case has to turn 90 degrees you're gonna
lose efficiency
they're anywhere between 20 and 40 50
percent I would say and it's gonna be a
bit louder as a result but I mean it's
mmm that's really tough yeah you could
do it I did it I mean that was fine so I
guess that's I guess you could look at
it like that okay I think I missed
somebody's oh I missed a couple of them
I'll make sure I get to the Super chats
uh here we go mister new rap sing thank
you for that 20 whatever that is but I
appreciate it thank you bask q3 last one
can i play can I pay you to be my calc
tutor I would be obliged my dude but I
frankly don't have the time between
school doing this and some of the other
small projects I'm doing on the side
right now it's just uh it's just a lot a
lot of stuff I'm up late I mean
everyone's busy I guess but you know it
would be cool to tutor I like teaching
but right now it's just not possible
with all the stuff going on the silent
observer what tips would you give for
someone starting out on YouTube I have
several videos already discussing this
it's you got to just do what you like to
do it sounds really cliche you got to
enjoy it because at first you're not
gonna get the recognition you feel like
you deserve or that you might want you
gotta keep going anyway and even if you
even if you don't get the views you want
you don't get the engagement you want
after six months you've still got to
keep going you got to do your best to
keep your production value high people
really appreciate that invest a little
bit upfront you know people say you can
start YouTube channels with phones
that's great and all but that's very
rare okay people are very judgmental
when it comes to production quality and
that's why I say within your budget as
long as you're comfortable and get
decent hardware at least for the
beginning then eventually you can work
we have to even better stuff but your
viewers will appreciate the effort into
making your videos sound good which is a
big one I would say it's almost as
important if not more important than the
camera and then making them look good
subsequently
let's see do please go says I missed his
thing let's see here
okay I see a dupe list thank you for
that $10 super chat Mon dude I can't
believe I missed that I really
appreciate your donation would what CPU
would you recommend for gaming at max
settings near max settings and live
streaming at the same time the Rison
2700 X or the I 970 900 X money isn't
really an issue for me you could be
depending on the resolution I don't
think either of the CPUs is really gonna
hold you back the 2700 I think is by far
the better value I don't really like the
i9 700 X from a value standpoint I think
it runs too hot requires too much
voltage requires really expensive
motherboard so performance societ I
think that there were 27 Ardex is just a
far better value like eons better value
for what you're gonna be doing I don't
think it'd be disappointing with a
streaming capacity over 27 or decks and
I don't think you're gonna be supported
with a frame rate that you'll see in
game with the 27 or deck so that's what
I would say many beats I saw that my do
too I saw that frenzy says let's see I
see frenzies 2700 X or 87 or K for live
streaming and gaming $20 difference
now if these questions are you guys are
like really splitting hairs here doesn't
matter
pick either one you're gonna have a
slightly higher frame rate with a 8700 K
and you're gonna have slightly better
experience streaming in most cases with
a 2700 X so do you think that your frame
rate you see is more important to you or
is the frame rate that your viewers seem
more important to you if it's the latter
it's the 2700 X if it's the former
it's the eighties I 100 K that's what
I'm gonna go with and yes I for a fact
know that that is the case in almost
every scenario that I've ran with what
I'll do is I'll usually start a stream
and I'll just upload that stream to my
live control room and I just won't let
the string go live and keep it unlisted
and I can monitor the actual like
footage right you can get a frame rate
from that an output frame rate based on
your encoding settings and actually I
think a couple of channels that do
similar stuff but that's just a good way
to go
you know you can gauge performance that
way and I would say stick with one of
those two based on your preference you
or your viewer Intel ops do you think
the air passing through rads could be
hazardous
what do you mean like you have air
trapped in your loop you try to try to
get air out of your loop as best as
possible not only is gonna be audible in
most cases but the airs gonna get really
hot it can cause issues with the walls
inside the radiator you get a lot of
buildup in there that's not air it'll
compress depending on how fast your pump
is if you don't have a locked pump speed
if it's you know according to a curve
like a fan curve so I don't really think
I would be comfortable with an air
pocket that big in my radiator if that's
what you're throwing to I don't know how
he would be able to like personally
inhale fumes from a radiator it's kind
of a weird question hell okay Rick Rick
DEA Spartan says should I sell my first
child for a dual 1080 setup that's about
what what a dual ten is said it will
cost nowadays so comes down at which one
you value more my friend frenzy clan can
you do a hangout to Q&amp;amp;A on stream again
I don't think so just because of just
because I would be liable if any of you
did something stupid and so I think
we've been graced at this point I want
to push my luck any further kareem of
when will the new gps from nvidia arrive
and nobody knows DJ drag what i don't
understand your question
dreamer and greg what could be a better
editing laptop in 2018 I have an H TPC
in gaming PC so I don't want to add more
add one more but I need something mobile
more for editing editing laptop look I
use Apple for my editing laptop because
I appreciate the well optimized software
that Apple's disposal Mac OS has of
course Final Cut Pro and then also movie
or I'm moving on moviemaker
I use iMovie a lot actually all of our
CES footage from 2018 that entire
playlist was edited with iMovie none of
you guys can tell probably good but it's
a great low profile software and things
render super quick because it's doing it
as your as your editing and same goes
for Final Cut Pro of course you have
more hands-on control of Final Cut Pro
so something to consider I see a do
please I'm glad but you appreciate that
yeah then do 120 fps once I get him
monitor it sounds good
opinion question from flame smoke
he asks I'll wait excuse me I lost your
question there we go thoughts on the
blind hate against the Apple I think I
think there are a few reasons why it's
it's a question you can't really answer
in two or three sentences but I'll just
go down the bullet list here so Apple is
generally more expensive for equitable
hardware
I'd only people appreciate the value of
Mac OS I don't think people in some
cases care for the for Mac OS because
it's to some extent lock down especially
from a gaming perspective I don't think
people like Apple because Apple is on
top in all and in several several
markets not just in the mobile market
they they excel they have a niche and
they do really well and that's why their
stock is so value but why their company
is as valuable as it is people don't
like that people like to hit on the guy
that not hit on but you know they like
to to beat up the guy who's on top
because they like seeing this
competition gonna roll out and when one
guys been the top dog for so long you
know I just feel like you got a punch
him a couple times and reminded he's
still human and I feel like that's part
of the reason why people hate Apple yeah
plenty of reasons why but no no it's
also the proprietary stuff that's
another thing sorry about that yeah that
was really proprietary their anal about
you fixing their stuff they have like
they literally a proprietary screws
right for screwheads that you don't have
in normal you know box stores so you
can't go up and just like buy a tool kit
that comes with that screw head and be
able to torque that screw right this is
that's Apple for ya so than that reason
why people don't like things that are
proprietary like that when they try to
keep things locked down it's just an
invitation for people to tinker with him
more because they want to be able to say
that they got into an Apple product and
tweaked with it so victress 22 think of
it that five New Zealand dollar my dude
greetings from New Zealand just joined
chat so forgive me if you have been
asked this what do you think of the
Linus Apple situation I've I have no
clue what you're talking about be honest
with you are you talking about something
with his Mac he hasn't hit an iMac
didn't he something happened with that
couple things happen with the Apple I
think they told him that he couldn't
repair something I saw that tweet I need
no more context but I mean that's Apple
for you guys that's Apple and when they
can't fix their own stuff but they
refused to fix their own stuff like
that's a huge problem because it's
already proprietary to begin with so how
you affect how do you expect me to fix
your stuff if you won't give me the
tools to fix it right so it's just I
think that's a beds a big stigma people
have with Apple all right you can pop up
in any desktop on Windows and till we
get for the most part apple it's a lot
more difficult and people for the most
part you know our polarizer that they
either like that is so proprietary
because it usually runs well and they
have experts that can geniuses I can fix
your stuff for you right and customer
service is generally really good with
Apple but on the other side you know if
they refused to help you or if you have
to pay a stack of cash to get it fixed
that's a problem yeah let's see if any
been B I can't even on but now to say
that says apple says refurbishment is
counterfeiting they sued and lost a case
recently yeah I mean IKEA there's
probably a lot of legality involved with
that but just on the on the surface
here's what I would say if you purchase
a product are you technically signing
you know are you agreeing to Terms of
Service are you signing a paper or a
document saying that you're not gonna
open this product and tinker with it
you'll avoid your warranty I mean that's
understood but like are you signing
something that prevents you as a person
as a customer from upgrading tweaking
hardware
maybe not software that's obviously
that's uli stuff but hardware that's
where it gets really iffy so you get a
lot of a lot of discussions on that
Anthony Malone have watched your vids
for a while thanks Anthony appreciate
that means a lot to me all caps explain
why overclocking increases performance
because clock speeds too high only
return only return diminishing returns
all caps I have videos on this literally
answering that question go to my minute
science playlist and watch why does CPUs
get so hot that'll answer your question
see flame smokes his Apple refused to
repair Linus's iMac Pro because he tore
it down and broke it in the process sad
I totally get why they aren't repairing
it but I guess they probably should
that's more of a PR issue at that point
like of course line is gonna blow that
up and show everybody who follows them
that hey look at apples being Apple or
being dicks right now they're not fixing
our stuff but on the surface if what
you're saying is true man if he opened
it and he started tinkering with
and then it broke it's not under
warranty anymore first off and then on
top of that you know if you broke
something that's not meant to be broke
the only way to do that is to actually
like drop it right with the thing open
cuz it's got a hard shell around it they
might not even have the technicians on
hand available to fix that stuff I'm
gonna having the components they might
not even sell the individual components
to fix this stuff they that buy the
whole board and then give you pieces of
it right and apples not generally gonna
do that unless you're a special client
and I guess I guess in Apple's eyes
Linus isn't a special client which is
the disappointment Linus is a cool guy
but you know when you when you tinker
with Apple stuff Apple's gonna get you
they're gonna make sure you don't touch
their stuff again
ya want to see scrolling down here
killer phobia why was I not informed of
this live stream that is all YouTube and
I have
for that I wish YouTube was just a
friendlier platform in that regard
just ant would you mind reviewing a
build I'm planning on building soon I
made a list on PC part Burke and sending
the link on Twitter if you want oh yeah
sure I can't promise I'll get to it it
just takes a lot of time to evaluate all
this stuff but I can look through it
kind of skim through and tell you I'll
try to look for you if a ton of people
send me a link so I'm not gonna probably
get to it I just can't go through that
many gamers in mind they cracked the
screen on the max he was willing he know
they cracked the screen on the max he
was gamers in mind that makes no sense I
don't understand contacts there Jody
what's up what's up Joe what's going on
dr. x17 have you played universe sandbox
dr. I lose I benchmark with University
in box I have a video like of me just
playing the game and watching CP
utilization unfold in real time so type
in science to be University in box and
you'll get to watch that video yeah
YouTube is just they're just being a
bunch of pricks right now I'm probably
gonna get demonetized for saying that
example a technology Oh
for the cooler master hyper 6:12 v2 air
cooler considering it's $35 price tag
cooler master hyper 6:12 let's see what
that looks like hyper 6:12
I mean it looks kind of cheap like a lie
generates only 20 dB
I find that hard to believe what size
fan is that oh I thought this is one of
those small coolers it looked really
small in the picture it's just the
cooler so huge that it that it looked
tiny look like it was like an 80 ml fan
on that so I take back my previous
statement it looks pretty beefy to be
honest where's that six heat pipes one
two three four five six yeah that's
pretty beefy was that 200 20/50 watt TDP
looking good I wish it looked a little
prettier on top though you know when you
come from a dark rock Pro for to this
this this still looks much cheaper by
comparison I might do it just a
do it but I don't think I would ever
personally use that to build okay James
Stoke says I think it may be an issue
with the store not having a technician
that has the proper training Linus was
willing to pay for the repairs knowing
they broke warranty yeah but sometimes
it's not even that easy because Apple
might have to go through a couple hoops
to get whatever they tinkered with fixed
and so yeah yeah Linus knew it wasn't
under warranty anymore he wanted to pay
for the parts repair but they still
didn't want to fix it what were they
doing exactly I need to know exactly
what he's doing because depending on
what he was tinkering with and what
broke that will that will explain the
whole situation so if you explain that
let me know I'm one more context Dylan
shift vet staff ellic Jett and jela Vic
shauvik whatever sorry about that it's
cool last name though so when is Edie
from tech stores gonna make a custom
loop for your guys competition all I'm
still way how long have been like I'm
like a year been like a year come on EDD
I want to see your second why actually I
think he built the second one it took
him like six months to do it but I'm
pretty sure he built the second one a
second hard line build I mean Superman
I'm on your mom someone asked I have a
girlfriend I have a wife thank you very
much Ben will Ben wheeler ten atti or
eleven eighty I don't even know anything
about the eleven eighty says kind of an
invalid question in my book scrolling
scrolling David Steele hey Craig first
of all thanks for the great content you
do appreciate that just wanted to ask
what I can do to reduce my cpu
bottleneck on my 7609 k with a 1070 what
game you playing there's not much you
can be able to do to reduce your C if
you bottom like apart from switching
your CPUs out if it's locked then
there's nothing else you can do to
reduce your bottleneck that I can think
of off top my head if it's some wealth
rattling you can deal it'd maybe
deleting it locked my file would be kind
of weird I think you're kind of at a
dead end there how that's one of the
disadvantages approaching a quad core i5
I know you bought it back when I was
until offer it but still if you're
getting CP bottlenecks your CP is maxing
out maxing out a hundred percent
utilization in many games which I don't
think it should it's probably a few
games you're looking at in particular
then you gotta upgrade to something has
more threads and this does a decent
clock speed would you ever want a BGA
CPU over a PGA one I've come to
appreciate PGA a bit more recently just
working with rising more off that first
sounds like this is dumb why are there
pins on the CPU like we can just hide
them in the motherboard but I've seen
probably as many bent pins on
motherboards from Intel as I have bent
pins on CPUs from Verizon so I kind of
see it both ways I think it's a
annoyance that these the way that the
horizon CP walks into the motherboard is
just stupid in my book because when you
pull off coolers sometimes the CPU just
going to rip out of the socket with it I
think that's really stupid she was a
poor design choice I think I wish they
would find a more efficient way to lock
it the problem is because the IHS
literally covers almost the entire chip
it's kind of hard to develop right a new
system to secure CPU so I think it's
more or less than the design choice of
the CPU at this point let's see yeah I'm
not doing it
Arthur says bro go to bed it's only
10:00 p.m. dude it's probably tired
because the cameras display it's just
such a low quality camera you can't see
all my beautiful reflections on my skin
is aimed be coming out with this from zu
Dane is anybody coming out with another
3 Series this year would that even make
sense after we have a ridge I am NOT
expecting them to anytime soon if they
do it's just like an afterthought
because to be honest rising Plus wasn't
a huge improvement from any like
performance standpoint over Eisen so
coming up with a rising 3 plus would
just be like ok come on like you know
I'm saying like it like let's just get
this one over way let's wait for the
real Rison to stuff which by the way
rise in to is n+ they're different
things totally different things but
people still insist on calling rise into
horizon - even though AMD hasn't
actually referred to this generation of
CPUs as arisin - they just call it rise
in second generation so reviewers are
giving it the name rise in - but what
people think of when they see rise into
to my knowledge is the next step it's
the next one right the big release we
expect will have we say yet but that we
expect to have even more substantial
improvements over I mean what we saw
like a 3% IPC jump with this n plus so
rise into whatever that is of being
hopefully will be a much larger jump
than we saw with this one a venomous
Teddy yes Spanish origins my father is
Spanish from Spain
more specifically northern Spain Castile
area Shawn Franta it's got a question
how small will CPUs get before we reach
the limit I have a video on this check
out quantum I have a video on quantum
computing I talked briefly about the
transistor limit right it's around five
nanometers we have ways of getting
around that now we were always worried
about quantum tunneling but we have
technologies in the world I mean look
Intel I think is come up with a foreign
enemy or CPU see if you wanna form for a
nanometer node so it's you know every
time we think we hit a wall we find a
way to get around the wall and that's
basically been the trend lately but we
expected around five nanometers would be
that and that that at which point
electrons were just tunnel right through
the barrier unhindered because the gap
is so small in a really rudimentary way
of explaining it is what quantum
tunneling is so a transistor doesn't
have an off state it's just always on
electrons are always flowing through so
it's not a transistor anymore think of
transistors like switches that's what
they do
scrolling down you're Anthony six one
five one a bit off-topic not problem
Anthony but what are your thoughts on
the second amendment I steer clear
politics in almost all cases I talked a
little bit of packet I talked a little
bit about economics politics in general
I will not go into debatable topics like
that this is a Science Channel not a
politics channel Jodi Greg have you
gotten your engineering degree yes sir
got my engineering degree last year in
fact you might be able to might be able
to see it that big thing right there
that sir is
degree bachelor's degree in petroleum
engineering absolute MMA 101 what's your
zodiac sign I was born in late October
I'm a Scorpio if you believe in that
kind of stuff
boardy ever build the p300 yes I built
in it type in p300 science to do you can
watch that video all about it then
Kirino do you think it's worth it to
upgrade from first generation Rison to
what though you got to be specific
bori or I'm not 40 sorry den Kirino what
do you want upgrade to that's what I
need to know Justin wo to attend all
Canadian my nude he tells me to go buy a
coffee and you know what that's kind of
funny because that would actually buy me
almost exactly one cup of coffee at
Starbucks or a similar joint right so uh
good thing I don't drink coffee honestly
how if I spend it on like pop-tarts or
something that's what gets me through
the day the greatness 1.99 how much for
a follow on twitter what do you mean oh
you want me to follow you on twitter oh
I don't know about that I love to see
we'll negotiate after the live stream
Ben know it lévesque you bipod butcher
that the 1180 is going to be like 10
percent faster than 1080 i cost less
consume less power
we'll see don't put your money on that
because nobody knows oh okay
Minnie beets I think it'd be cool if you
designed your own PC case and did videos
around that also control shift escape is
the fast hockey for task manager those
are my super chats ctrl shift escape I
would use Control Alt Delete that's how
I get a task manager oh I was he was
saying you don't have to go into the
little menu to click task to see this is
because I'm used to I was used to XP
I've always done Control Alt Delete it's
just like what's engraved in my mind
what do we have here I am looking at all
right we got a pretty decent showing
right now 300 or so people watching not
bad for Sunday night thank you guys
again for uh supporting the channel just
by watching this live stream you don't
have to donate or anything like that you
guys just watching is enough for me it's
just a kick in the behind it keep
grindin because this is why do I do it
for the guys who are willing to take
time out of the day to watch a live
stream link
and Jesus Peschel II the guys are
willing to donate ten dollars to me to
buy coffee I got real I don't even Thank
You Rio has a guitar for yo $10 Dhoni
but I do not like coffees so I hope
you're not gonna be disappointed when I
don't spend ten bucks on coffee and
instead buy pop-tarts because that's
what I do
i buy pop-tarts pop-tarts and hot
pockets which is a pop-tart technically
like a cold hot pocket that's one of
those like I think they have the same
architecture right Jesus sound like an
Internet stupid they have the same I
mean no I'm trying to say they look the
same Jesus there's like a jelly goo
filling in the middle and then there's
like a crusty shell on the outside you
guys get where I'm going with this
anyway back on topic Year blame smoke
also double pressing forestry started it
double pressing force I don't get that
Rio has a guitar another $2 just to say
damn really come on man you could have
made more use out of that $2 but thank
you for it anyway I appreciate that
pizza rolls better than hot pockets you
know Superman I gotta be honest with you
I actually agree I actually agree Benny
Benny Benny says you graduated college
don't need to eat hot pockets anymore
lol I gotta be honest with you I still
kind of do it look I don't make a lot of
money I'm not like I'm not rolling a
dough my car cost $20,000 like it was
it's not an expensive car I live in an
apartment that is frankly pretty
expensive for what it is but I'm not
paying you know a ton of money to live
here this is like 1,300 square feet so
like I could be making more money
working as an engineer for sure but I
like doing this more and that's why I
mean I do it free I do it for me because
I love it but I also do it because I
love you guys I love working with you
guys um
Levitan asked I'm rich hopefully what I
just said answers that question for you
you you said to ask you anything can I
have your GTX 1080
no you can't I'm sorry Robert sorry
terr and I actually bought those myself
some you guys probably even know I
bought both of those 1080s myself
granted it was before the prices went
way up but I did buy before all right
we're gonna answer a couple more here
for like an hour and 20 minutes or so my
voice was getting shot as usual around
this time he's not the only one talking
so I puts a strain on my excuse me my
vocal cords Biser I think I said that
right hey Greg
what CPU do you think would pair better
with a 1063 gig value eyes I'm thinking
about the r5 1600 budget that's a great
choice that's a that's a really good
choice for for a CPU to pair with that
you could even upgrade it at some point
you're 1062 a 1070 with an r5 1600 or
2600 and you're still gonna be sitting
good in the neighbor it's a great
balance so yeah one of the best ones in
my opinion best combos is that the r5
1606 scores better than four and
something like a 1060 or 1070 or a 580
or 480 on AMD side Daniel Suzuki that's
a cool last name I think that is that
your real last name or just going after
the manufacturer do you have advice on
where to find GPUs for MSRP
closest you're gonna get my friend is
used unless you just scooped up a really
sweet deal on new egg just check new I
can amazon every single day scroll
through even the open box stuff the
refurbished stuff scroll through it all
you might find a graphics card of D you
might get lucky okay he uh let's see
James hemin is it worth doing a custom
loop while in college and having to move
apartments around only if you're gonna I
would say if you're gonna be moving
every three months like having a custom
loop is okay because you're gonna
preferably drain the loop anyway after
three months but if you're moving them
once a month that's too much that's a
lot of stress on on the the tubing too
so it depends on how much you move but
if you're moving every three months or
later three months or longer then I
would say that's probably okay
avocado on Pete on PC wants me to grow
out my beard guys I seriously would but
it's just the most annoying thing ever
it just gets so scratchy and it doesn't
look good you like that awkward phase or
it's like not filled in that's me right
now and I'm talking to shave after this
just cuz you pointed it out anyway
absolute MMA ones I next went what's
coming up next for our duty x11 80 or
GTX 2080 no idea dude
I have no I have no info for you all
this is speculation at this point any
clue as 2011 series cards will come out
no clue I don't have any inside
information I don't even talk to end
video directly I don't get in video
samples from anybody except after
products have launched maybe I get some
from companies that already have these
in stock but I don't get initial launch
graphics cards
let's see mojo man 265 from Nvidia said
anyway I should say mojo man what's
going on my dude hey Grady still play on
the street on the steam group chat I've
been deployed for the last year mojo are
you still in a discord if you're still
another score then boom there you go but
we don't I don't usually interact much
with the steam group anymore because it
was getting a little out of hand it's
the way I decided to handle that was
with patreon some people who actually
genuinely want to hang out with me can
pay a buck a month that's like all I
require for you'll be able to join
discord and talk to me one-on-one and
whatnot if you think that's even worth
it you might not think it's worth it
that's fine but for the people who do
think is worth it that's why it's there
so if you want to get down and dirty I'm
trying to get into the process of
playing games with more people it's I
just really when I find the time it's
for maybe an hour and then trying to get
people and discord to play you know
trying to get like three or four people
every now that I have someone ask and
it's like as I'm getting off like
oddball tried to do that and I felt
really bad cause she was like play with
me and I didn't realize that he said
that until I got out of the game and he
said he runs our discord server so yeah
I kind of felt bad about that it's
really hard to coordinate gaming stuff
now for just much bigger frankly than we
used to be in so it's hard to keep up
yeah I'll get better at it I'm trying to
make it patreon donors feel like they're
getting something for what they're
paying make raw 5 a year no that's is
that euro yeah bye euro my - thank you
love your vids keep it up question I 780
700 K horizon 2700 mainly for gaming at
1440p but also photo editing and
programming at uni 8700 k if you're
going to mostly play video games then
the 87 RK is fine and at 1440p honestly
those CPUs are gonna get pretty close to
each other you if you're choosing to
2700 and the 2700 X though I don't even
know about that
I haven't tested the 2700 I would say 87
okay is a better bet for gaming right
now still I mean it is just factually
but the 2700 is probably more future
proof in the long run it's a tough one
either one you're gonna be perfectly
happy with so I've just picked the one
you feel more comfortable with to be
honest the greatness I wish your channel
didn't die you deserve more channel you
me doesn't die I hope it didn't die it's
not dead it's still alive but thank you
thank you for another dollar I mean I
dude you know I keep doing that I
appreciate it though scrolling down here
okay alright two more questions two more
questions after the super chats sander
McDonald Bob dalla Canadian thank you
for that hey yeah I'm currently
designing a custom heat sink for the x99
45 nanometer of clearance and a 120mm
fan could you change your opinion of the
board x99 ii ITX could you change your
opinion of the board I'm confused by
what you're asking Sandra I don't think
I have an opinion on the X 9 board Gita
are you talking about the ass rock board
that's an old video I'd have to even go
back and look at what I said about that
but I changed I think what I said in
that video was that having x99 and an
ITX form factor is a little
counterintuitive right because you want
the best overclock as possible on that
and you really can't get them with a
small form factor system and on top of
that you're losing the extra PCIe lanes
right you're gonna have a much higher
heat output depending let's cpu throw in
there it's just you know if you're if
you wanted just a game with and stuff
throwing an i7 in there it's gonna be a
much better bit like a you know
consumer-level i7 I'm not an enthusiast
ly7
gonna give you a much smoother
experience gaming anyway let's see your
you euro mode in Yuri mode in $2
donation thinking for that is it just me
or is 6 C 6 course 6 red eye 5 too late
in the game it's not really too late in
the game if all you do is play video
games the i5 is still a great value and
scores is just a it's an added bonus
from for yeah it's not the most future
proof but you know it's just it's it it
is a limiting factor it will become a
limiting factor probably before anything
else in your system just straight up
sander to clarify it's more feasible
with these and Cooling okay yeah it's
more feasible with decent cooling but
like what case are you using right to
cool that CPU you have to have a large
heat sink or you have to have a larger
small form-factor case at which point
like if it's not a really small ITX case
what's the point just buy a bigger one
that costs less you know a bigger
motherboard that is generally less
expensive you also get the added lanes
less you can take advantage of multiple
graphics cards you can throw a Wi-Fi
card or capture card in there blah blah
blah you see what I'm saying see you're
you're losing things at the same time
you decide to shrink the overall form
factor with x99 in particular I just
think it's yeah shadow how would you
rate your time in Lousiana more
specifically your ull experience I'm
from right outside of Baton Rouge and
I'm looking at going to southeastern
from computer science ul was really cool
I really liked it it's it's definitely
like a very homely College it's not too
big I think like 10 to 15,000 students
so it's it's only average size I don't
like the fact that the campus is split
in two so go to the gym or to like the
park or anything like that you had to
walk about two blocks down
no is it Louisiana Avenue yeah I'm
pretty sure it's Louisiana Avenue
oh no Johnson Street Johnson Street
that's the one that's on the left side
yeah Johnson Street is the one you got
to walk down to get to the gym and stuff
and I hated that I did not like having
to walk that far for the gym so if you
try to stay active stay at Letta kin
school and that's gonna be an issue
unless you feel comfortable driving
there every day my other school was
really nice because the gym was like
right on campus so that was cool all
right one more question one more
question
let's see archimedes yes i'm reviewing
the scythe cooler the low profile side
cooler I don't that's one you're talking
about but I'm gonna review a really low
profile side cooler here soon stay tuned
for that one more question one more
question
I'm looking for a really juicy question
really juicy you guys were a throw some
really juicy stuff at me or be a little
bitter and give me some juice you guys
Sandra I disagree that SLI is dead I
don't think I said I was dead and I
think it I think it definitely has a
place in the market tchau tchau z it
wasn't walking to go we're gonna dude it
was just a time thing it took 30 minutes
to get there if you wanted to walk there
that's inconvenient I could run on a
treadmill for five minutes and get the
same workout you see I'm saying it was
just a waste of my time because I was
also a full-time student and I was also
a full-time youtuber I was working on
building a business at the same time as
I was trying to keep my GPA a 3.8 and
then I had to waste 30 minutes to go to
the gym right so that was my
inconvenience that's all I was pointing
that out for secret tonic hds he says
really juicy question how comfortable is
that for a year to hear I talked about
it earlier in the livestream don't worry
folks that doesn't count
do you like juice from David Steele yes
I do I see I see I see here origin zag
on jewelry this is a good question for
five years for the next five years
8700 K or 2700 X I think 2,700 X I think
the extra two cores and four threads
will come in more handy five years from
now than the 8700 K well that's my
personal opinion you might not agree
with that but if I was looking like
severe long-term I would go with the
higher core countship that still could
maintain a decent frequency and right
now that's the 2,700 X it has great RAM
support out of the box which was an
impressive jump and it has a very low
power or high power tolerance up to a
point so you can run chip at 4 gigahertz
or 4.1 gigahertz on very low power
consumption which is really good low
voltage requirements it's just it's a
big improvement but with respect of that
not necessarily from the IPC side again
but it's a big improvement from from a
power delivery standpoint and from a
voltage requirement standpoint so you
guys I appreciate all of you watching
I'm very sorry that I didn't
to some of your questions again I do
these every one every Sunday night I
just opened it up livestream Q&amp;amp;A
whatever you guys want to talk about
it's it's really here for you guys
and I know I'm not gonna get to every
question every week these weeks do fly
by though you guys blank will be here
this time next week and I will do my
