iBook close to a dozen with custom loops
now I'm certainly not the best at it in
my designs
don't please everyone it's inevitable
this is the internet but I've learned
quite a bit from my experiences
regarding to bending flow order and
radiator config so I want to focus on a
couple of those in this video today
because I received a request from a
fellow viewer in the comment section of
one of my previous videos his question
essentially was how many radiators do
you need how do you know how many you
need and what will happen if you don't
have enough of them so let's answer that
question today so I actually have some
personal experience with custom loops
lacking sufficient rad space and not
only that I've got experience with rads
lacking sufficient airflow there is a
difference between the two and you'll
know based on the symptoms so I join
imagine any closed loop without enough
airflow and radiator surface area will
incur excessive heat buildup the liquid
in the loop mostly water doesn't have
magical dissipation powers it may have a
relatively high heat capacity but it'll
try to equalize much like any other
medium my general rule of thumb is to
allocate at least 120 millimetres of
diagonal rad space that looks something
like this per processing unit so that's
per graphics card and per CP for example
a standard one CPU one GPU config that's
most builds I imagine will require at
least one of these that's a single 240
ml radiator we look really weird to put
two 120 s in a custom loop independently
but I guess you could do that too if the
pump is especially weak it might not be
enough still DD C's d5 pumps are plenty
you don't worry but if you spliced both
the CPU and the GPU into a single a IO
config like this one right here from
deep pool then this pump in here is
probably not going to be enough and the
same goes for most ASA tech pumps out
there so pump speed up to a certain
threshold yes it does make a difference
if you're not pulling heat fast enough
away from your units then they will
overheat your entire loop will and
radiator service area is another factor
to consider but these aren't the only
ones fan placement rpm and access to
fresh air should all be considered as
well I can speak to these firsthand do
you remember my andromeda custom loop
build that's actually my favorite build
to date from an aesthetic standpoint it
was severely crammed that was something
I liked about it but it also
it was starving for airflow so notice
the positions of these fans here they
were actually placed outside the fractal
defined seat chassis meaning they only
had about two or three centimeters of
breathing room which is simply not
enough it's not recommended I don't
recommend you do this and I thought it
would be OK at least for some light
gaming and editing of course the
graphics part isn't gonna be you know
working that hard when you're editing
and it proved to be just fine for that
and some light gaming I can get away
with but when it went you know when it
came to a really heavy intensive game
where both the GPUs and the cpu were all
being utilized pretty heavily this
simply was not enough there was not
enough air being introduced into the
case to keep that the fluid temps down
especially but the in the entire system
as a whole every unit was or heating
yeah not recommended but in combination
with a 360 mil rat is a copper rad from
alpha cool 30 mil thick look that was
fine and I'd say that you know if I did
that again it would be okay I just had
to emphasize airflow more than I
actually did in there so SLI GTX 280s
and a 6700 K all overclocked definitely
wouldn't hold up and this one actually
had to down clock everything back to
stock to heat those temperatures in
check and even then I'm pretty sure my
fluid temperatures were bridging into
some uncharted uncomfortable territories
that's something else I want to touch on
fluid temperatures the water in your
loop shouldn't generally exceed I would
say 40 degrees Celsius you could
probably get away with a bit more but
some pretty bizarre things start to
happen in the mid to high 40s I can
attest to these again first hand this is
all just one big learning experience for
me first pumps can be permanently
damaged and these aren't cheap
components by any means since they rely
on liquids in the loops to cool the
bearings not DDC pumps in this case but
ki5 pumps in particular any t delta
higher than roughly 10 to 15 degrees of
room temperature can substantially
reduce the transferable properties of
the water the conduction equation which
solves for the rate of heat transfer
that's Q over T generally between two
mediums it indicates that temperature
deltas are the driving forces of this
rate of heat transfer if the difference
is pretty small you know everything else
constant then the resulting numerator is
smaller and the resulting rate of heat
transfer is lower these are directly
proportional if the difference between
t1 and t2 is higher then the numerator
is bigger and thus QT is
conduction isn't the only force at play
in a system like this but it does get my
point across and it is something to
consider a hot pump is no good pump for
example I prematurely concluded here
that primo chilled revolver fittings did
this to my PE GG tubing however what I
ended up finding out later was at the 70
100 X that's the i9 Intel CPU that will
fry eggs guaranteed and Walter white
version 3 was dumping far too much heat
into the loop with the overclock I was
running was like 4.7 or 4 point 8
gigahertz in the short run temperatures
were fine but as discussed in this video
right here custom loops and AI O's
require a lengthy torture test before
the temperatures of the liquids in them
fully equalized in a nutshell with this
one I underestimated the amount of heat
the CPU ended up dumping into the loop
hence the softening of the PE TG and
strange warping you're seeing here what
I want you to take away from this custom
loops are not the easiest things to
tackle and you'll have to consider
several variables per build even the
simplest things though you don't want to
overlook especially like with a number
of rads and you know the amount of
airflow you have in your case and fluid
temperatures TD pees all of that so make
sure you consider all of those factors
before you jump into a build like this
one because it's gonna really suck if it
ends up not being a fully stable system
in the long run especially after torture
testing the thing because you found out
you didn't include enough radiators or
maybe you're using too weak a pump or
you just have too much in there and it's
just heating the liquid up too much that
it's not being dissipated quick enough
and if you don't have enough rad support
space in your chassis then that means
you got to change your case and yeah the
rabbit hole never ends that's custom
loops in general though and that's kind
of why I like them they're blank slates
you can really get creative with these
builds and make them look unique but
there are again several factors to
consider if you liked this video be sure
to give it a thumbs up I appreciate that
thumbs down the for or the opposite
