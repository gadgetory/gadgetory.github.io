it's got a long name and a long list of
features but are they relevant to you
for all intents and purposes in this
video I'll be referring to this monitor
as the 272 because it's full name is
just ridiculously long and as always you
can find it to link in this video's
description so this is a 27-inch 1440p
IPS monitor and it's beautiful
supporting two HDMI ports DisplayPort
built-in speakers a headphone jack and
an integrated AC converter which means
no ugly block hanging from your displays
power cord
but the 272 is not intended for gamers
I'll make that very clear distinction up
front its feature set is curved more
toward content creators concerned with
accurate color reproduction and a
visually organic experience most of the
time gaming monitors tend to focus on
high paced experiences right so they
push for things like higher refresh
rates and low input lag and while the
t-72s panel is only 60 Hertz native its
response time is actually respectable at
5 milliseconds graded grade I tested it
that's about what it came out to go
higher like 8 milliseconds but you won't
tell the difference in most cases I can
also confirm that input lag is virtually
unnoticeable via keyboard and controller
of course these are the kinds of things
you want to look for in a gaming monitor
right you don't have those weird
drawbacks the only thing that's
crippling this one known the reason why
I'm saying it's not a good gaming
monitor because the only 60 Hertz and
for about 400 US Dollars depend on where
you look where you find this and where
you live it's it's just not going to
compete with the hundred and forty four
heads TN panels that you can get for the
same price it's still gamma bowl of
course you could game on a cathode ray
tube display but for 400 bucks this is
right in the crosshairs of some 1080p in
1440p 144 Hertz true gaming panel 20
would argue granted most of those
utilize TN technology it's just cheaper
color reproduction on those isn't going
to be as good as this in this case you
get a beautiful IPS display with 100% s
RGB color space coverage this is where
content creator ears perk up look at
this point on the channel I script edit
film produce my own videos so I have a
good idea of what a video should look
like when it's finally uploaded to
YouTube for all of you to see if I'm
editing on a TN panel which I've been
doing actually for quite a while I
notice that some of my videos don't look
the same on that panel as I do on other
mobile devices so like my laptop this
MacBook here probably is going to show
me a better color
then the TN panel will infect it will
for sure it's actually been proven so I
might see small imperfections on the
MacBook that I don't see in the TN panel
because it's not showing me a wide range
of colors so maybe a green tint is
exposed on the MacBook but it's not
exposed on the TN panel white balance
issues could also be at play here panel
like this is not going to let you down
because color reproduction is literally
spot on it just comes with the territory
if you rent to buy a TN panel chances
are you've already rationalized that
your color reproduction is not going to
be the best but you're probably going to
save some money by choosing TN panel
over its IPS counterpart just because
it's an older technology there are other
things that you should consider but if
you're just going to be gaming it's
probably not going to matter as much
whether you choose an IPS or T and
display I can't say though that if I'm
going to be content creating on just the
monitor that I purchased this is the one
that I want
definitely IPS technology is by far the
better content creation choice the 60
Hertz refresh rate doesn't hurt in this
case either and the additional
technology on board makes things easy on
the eyes the first of these traits is
what BenQ calls brightness intelligence
Plus which utilizes an on-board ambient
light sensor to detect lighting changes
in your room so when you view the
display in something in your environment
darkens your surroundings the technology
will adjust the display itself
accordingly perhaps by slightly dimming
the display and altering white balance
to a warmer tone Apple does the things
similar to this with their retina
enabled devices it works well under most
circumstances and is often times so
subtle you won't immediately notice it
and that's a good thing
the best part is it's virtually
hands-free the monitor is going to
adjust everything it needs to on its own
and it's not going to overcompensate and
wash things out it's not going to darken
a display so much to where you're like
what the heck just happened it's
actually pretty intelligent as its name
describes and you likely won't have to
go through the on-screen display after
you initially pull it out of the box the
contrast ratio is a thousand-to-one IPS
isn't going to be the greatest when it
comes to true blacks but they do appear
much deeper in person almost AMOLED like
which was nice to see and not a single
speck of backlight bleed which I'd
expect from monitor of this caliber
other things you'll get with this IPS
technology are insane viewing angles up
to 178 degrees from Center and you won't
notice a single color out of black TN
forget it that's not going to happen and
display brightness of 315 it's is plenty
for even well-lit rooms but this brings
up an important issue with this panel in
fact most
pS panels in general it's going to be
super reflective now you can see the
light behind me is already reflecting
off of the screen on a TN panel that
would be rather subdued this one also
does not have a matte coating over it so
they're actually sacrificing the glare
for the sake of having a truer color
gamut because if you put a match screen
over this the colors not going to look
as good they're going look slightly
washed out
that's just what you get when you choose
a content creation monitor like this one
so for this unit here I think it's a
wise choice for going the matte finish
just keep the glare in mind now to touch
from the speakers I mentioned earlier
yes they are integrated and and they
sound okay I was actually surprised they
were even included to begin with but I
would give them something like a 5 out
of 10 in terms of just audio quality
they get pretty loud but that's when
they start getting you know pretty messy
and distorted so I'm going to compare
the quality of the monitor to the
quality of my MacBook MacBook Pro is
that pretty good sound coming into the
2017 models do so I'm gonna play the
exact same song coming from this and
then this at about the same volume level
and you can judge for yourself
so the two-seven 2's are satisfactory at
least they're included in fact many
gaming monitors don't even include
speakers anymore because they expect
gamers to use headsets or surround sound
systems this also includes a headphone
jack which I'll admit many gaming
monitors still don't include so this has
feature sets that you wouldn't expect it
to have considering it's not being
targeted toward gamers but it still
doesn't make up for the fact that it's
not a higher refresh rate panel but an
aspect of the 272 that I absolutely hate
I hate it so much is the included stand
so it's super easy to assemble
completely tool-less by the way but you
can't pivot the display left nor right
without rotating the entire setup
vertical pivoting is also extremely
limited a workaround here is base of
support which this monitor definitely
has but it's a shame to see a $400
display placed on such a terrible stand
the last thing I'm grappling with right
now is the price of this display at
around 400 US dollars it comes across
with a bit pricey to some others might
see it in a more affordable light it's
all relative really but what isn't
relative is the feature set sure it's
got some cool features and the 1440p
panel of true-to-life colors is sure to
impress many I also am a huge fan of
this virtually devilís display that
always makes things look more futuristic
more innovative but I imagine many will
contend with this price when I recommend
the 272 for gamers absolutely not it's
not fair question no it wasn't really
intended for gamers to begin with what I
recommend it to content creators though
well it depends on how much $400 means
to you could you do better probably
but with the excellent reputation of
BenQ probably not at least for what this
monitor was intended as always you can
find this product linked in the video
description check it outside of my
affiliate account gives me a small
kickback I'd appreciate that if the
amazon link is not there it's just not
sold on amazon yet so i'll put something
else there for the time being also I'm
curious as to what monitor is your go-to
monitor which one's your daily driver
comment with that description down below
just curious so know what you think is
good for the price if you like this
video be sure to give it a thumbs up
thumbs down for the opposite click
subscribe if you haven't already and
stay tuned for the next video on the
channel a Rison v pc build why is there
always dust in this room this is signed
