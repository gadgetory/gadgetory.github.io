if hardware encoding is there gonna do
us any better today than yesterday it
shows every now and then that we have an
issue with the the buffering just the
the bitrate which I have really great
internet to be honest so I know I'm not
limited by my bandwidth I think is more
or less just an optimization issue at
this point I have a 2700 X in the system
and whenever I do X dot 2 6 for encoding
all right that's a that's a perfectly
fine CPU in fact it's probably overkill
for any kind of streaming that I do with
a webcam but I still get issues
uploading to YouTube for this live
stream so a little curious as to how
well hardware encoding will do we're
gonna use in video acceleration here
number 10 70 T on the build by the way
if I sound terrible
I sound too loud to quiet let me know up
front I'm watching the chat right now
I also need to add the chat box to the
live stream so you me one second here
pop-out chat and then go to the editor
browse the sauce okay should be good now
thinking it's fine now let me know if
it's not but I think it's good anyway
sorry about that in the beginning and
yeah that's what I'm thinking Kryptonian
I well hardware encoder is gonna do I
was thinking that if I was gaming it
wouldn't be ideal right because then I
just then you're using the graphics card
not only for pushing out those frames
but also for you know actually encoding
the live stream so I don't know we'll
see I think it'll be fine either way to
be honest but I just get tired of seeing
the you know your stream might be
buffering for some viewers notification
that I get from YouTube and it's just
kind of a pain you know anyway what's
going on everyone we have about 80
people watching up front I appreciate
you guys stopping by this Sunday night
or Monday morning depending on where you
live in the world this is our 13th
after-hours stream and in these it's
pretty straightforward
you guys just asked me questions I'm
here to answer as many questions as I
can if I don't know the answer to leave
a question that you're asking I will do
my best to research the topic and Reva's
it either in a dedicated video or in the
next after hours livestream that we have
and I'll actually start taking some
notes soon so that I don't forget some
of these questions you guys have some
good questions and then that's why I
want to keep this going because as long
as I can as long as I can be here and
have content right which is basically
fulfilled by you guys you guys are
giving me the content for these live
streams then I will continue making them
and I have a lot of fun talking you guys
so hopefully you stick around
I appreciate 100 or so we have watching
at this point and we're gonna just jump
on into it I see right here far farhan
akhtar
i'm pretty sure i butchered that mmm
horizon twenty six hundred and eleven
seventy okay I don't even I don't know
anything about the eleven seventy yet
and I can't speak about the eleven
seventy because I don't have clearance
to do that if that even exists I
wouldn't even know if it did okay so I
can't talk about the eleven seventy if
you're asking just strictly about the
2600 or the i-5 8400 my my preference
would be toward the 2600 because I think
that it's gonna suit you better in the
long run the 8400 is a better gaming CPU
yes but only marginally better I don't
think if you've held two systems
side-by-side you're gonna notice a
difference between a 2600 and a 8400
when it comes to games right and
basically any game for that matter and
on top of that if you decide in the
future you want to do more than just
game the 2600 is gonna be the better bet
for you so that's that's my
recommendation again if you just want to
you know ball up on an i5 you can
totally do that you're actually gonna
have a better gaming experience compared
to your eyes.and counterparts but is
that marginally higher FPS beneficial in
the long run especially if you're
thinking about limiting yourself to just
games for the foreseeable future gotta
ask yourself that question
Bath's q3 for that $5 super chat have
you considered doing super cheap use
builds like Brian TECA City does doesn't
seem like many others are doing it yeah
and to be honest like you know because
Brian's so good at doing it already and
I've talked to Brian a lot we were
live-streaming last night and and I
think both of our live streams are
archived on our respective channels so
check those out if you haven't already
we probably answered some pretty good
questions in there
and you know Brian's been doing this for
so long it's almost kind of I'm almost
afraid to do it because I feel like I'm
gonna do some make some new mistake I'm
gonna buy something and spend more money
than I should on it and then you guys
move Brian from Tokyo City did it like
this and he did much better and I'm sure
he's done it okay so what I actually
want to do is team up with Brian we
might do something kind of like this in
Taiwan I'm not sure because copy Texas
coming up next month but I want to do
something with Brian you know kind of
hands-on I really like the guy he's
really cool down to earth and he
straight up you know like he knows what
a product's worth he knows how to
combine components that are really cheap
and build these systems that are still
extremely viable for very low prices and
so I want to learn from the used PC
parts master so I don't take it on my
own completely just yet I've built a few
use PCs but I've never claimed them to
be like the ultimate value pcs just
because I don't know the used market
well enough yet so just something I'm
looking forward to I really am and we're
definitely in talks Brian I'm Brian and
I are in talks about stuff like that so
we'll see what we get going here soon uh
guess I'm scrolling up here I see some
good let's see what's your daily driver
phone this is from caspo Dan with an
underscore following his name for some
odd reason my daily driver to be honest
is an iPhone se you're gonna think
that's really weird I have another daily
driver that I admittedly didn't pay for
it's the LGV 30 the LG sent me direct
and I really like that phone for a
totally different reason but I think
that the one thing I don't like about
the V 30 is it's a little too big right
so it's basically like a six eight it's
a six inch screen on a five and a half
inch body well you know what a five and
half inch screen would be right for the
full body size of the phone and it's
just - it's too big I don't like having
to hold the phone with two hands to
reach the upper left hand corner like
with this right here it's super simple I
can reach the top of the screen I can
reach both sides of the screen with my
thumb just by holding it and you know
naturally where I normally do and that's
that's the phone size I like I would
compromise definitely on the bigger
screen my wallet stole my pocket I would
compromise on the bigger screen for
sure' for the sake of having something
more compactly it's still powerful the
iPhone se is
that for me comes with iMessage and all
the goodies I don't like tampering with
my phone much anymore now like I used to
in a good old days in high school I was
always rooting my phones and flashing
roms and all the good stuff so yeah it's
thanks Krypton I appreciate that so it's
great can't take the 6 inches I mean I
really look there's any other way to
word it I just don't like the bigger
phones I prefer the stuff it's more
compact and hopefully you know there's
been rumors about the SE 2 right having
the almost full-body screen but in a
much smaller form factor the issue with
that is the battery size you can't fit a
large battery into such a small phone
and you would think that would be the
Achilles heel of this but the screen is
you know it's pretty low res it's not
too bright and you know the the CPU in
here is pretty efficient for what it is
oh I Oh s is pretty efficient you know
these are all pretty low profile
operating systems that Apple's using and
that's why like the Mac books typically
have longer battery lives too because
the operating systems aren't utilizing
as many resources especially at idle
okay moving on do you recommend
overclocking the 8700 K just for gaming
Jason Lin of course I do if you're gonna
buy an 87 hundred K I would I would buy
it with the overclocking intent in mind
like definitely you just got to make
sure you have a cooler to back it up get
yourself a decent you know you spend 30
40 bucks on a cooler as long as it's not
like a super low profile ITX cooler
tower coolers are great they're super
quiet in most cases fairly easy to
install a iOS are gonna be quiet as well
in a different respect you might hear
the pump more than you hear the fans
which is kind of a weird sensation but
they look very good and they're
typically gonna cost a bit more than
your average air cooler so you have to
kind of weigh the pros and cons there
and move on from there but I will say
that datacenter K is definitely worth
overclocking I mean why would you buy
the 87 okay if you're not going to
overclock it they have the 8700 if you
Arnage didn't that and then you can pair
it with a B 360 board if you want save
some dough just another way to look at
it if you want Chris wheeler what is the
fastest graphics card for gaming I would
recommend if you if you're just looking
at like mainstream cards right now the
1080 TI is pretty much the best we got
unless you want to venture in a Titan
territory which would ultimately end up
costing you a thousand bucks
maybe more because of how tight graphics
card supply is still every now and then
you find a pretty good deal and that's
when they get an influx of stock and
they want it out quick
the 1070 TI's are in stock right now
they are heavily in stock and that's why
they're pretty much priced as good as a
1080 right now ten eighties aren't
excuse me at the ten seventy ten 70s
aren't as much in stock yet because they
were some of the best to mega hash for
walk cards to use from mining on
invidious side so the 1070 eyes which
were right in production later have kind
of just been sitting in these warehouses
and they're trying to get them out and
that I think those are the better deals
at this point unless you want to venture
into the used market critical with a one
and a K what's the best PC config that
can run any game 90 plus FPS and 1080p
depends on your in-game settings in
1080p but I would say 1060 or 1070 from
Nvidia I wouldn't venture an Rx
territory right now because it's it's
gonna be very difficult to find those
cards still so give it a few more months
before I recommend AMD cards fully for
systems like these so if you can find a
second-hand maybe 787-8 ET i even 980ti
for 300 bucks or so I'm gonna be little
less efficient on power but you're gonna
save some money in the long run and then
maybe an i5 or an r5 CPU depending on
which way you lean right blue or red
typically people have a preference but
if you don't have a preference I
recommend going with red you won't be
dissatisfied there and you'll be
future-proof for quite a while so weird
I don't take where a phrase I don't take
lightly future proofing it gets overused
a lot but honestly the argument for
future proofing is in Andy's hands right
now okay I am seeing eggy and scorch
asked what your current main gaming
keyboard is I'm using a keyboard from
coolermaster actually I have
Coolermaster keyboards on all of my PC's
and these are I want to say let me see
master I want to set like master keys
okay so we have the master keys pros
those are those are really good and then
we also have trying to think of the
other ones that we have I know the one
I'm using here isn't a master
Keys Pro let me see I want to give you
an exact answer answer here because okay
that's not coming up oh great great
anyway
yeah I'm not finding it and it's the
wrong email that's why the the cooler
master keyboard oh yeah here we go okay
I seen this and I'm looking at the
keyboards okay we have better launch a
new keyboard I'm literally going through
my business email here trying to find it
in terms of the keyboard okay the master
keys mk7 50s those are the ones so the
MK 750 I'm gonna go ahead and link it
I'll find it on Newegg here actually
I'll just do it on Amazon MK 750 all
right I'm gonna click on this bad boy
these are cherry MX what are these
Cherry MX browns yeah these are browns
which are a healthy medium and why am i
that's weird
that's for some reason I've signed out
of all this stuff okay
geez copy and paste there you go and
that's not affiliated or anything you
just click on it it'll take you to it's
the us site so you might have to change
it to dot de or dot CA or wherever you
live but that is the keyboard that I'm
using right now on this PC I love the
palm rest it's great it's just
magnetically attaches and clip in at all
you just slap it on there and it stays
and I love that it's very simplistic and
the RGB is a little difficult to get
used to write calibration wise but it
looks great
okay enough about keyboards here we go
Skrill scrilla t'n scrilla ttan all
right sweet hey Greg I'm looking to
stream in the near future what process
would you recommend from both blue and
red team red team at least an r5 CPU
2600 you can even go back to 1st gen
risin summit ridge 1600 you could
probably get by with a 1500 or 1400 but
I would say a 1500 X but I would try to
keep it around 6 cores because
I want that extra Headroom right for
gaming as well and games are gonna
utilize around four cores on average so
if your CPU ttle ization is lower than
you can stream at a higher bitrate
especially if your software encoding so
just keep that in mind and then on
Intel's side at least an i-5 and I would
say at least a coffee like i-5 if you're
gonna stream with anything older than
coffee League try your best to get an i7
it will definitely help and that's why
rise in such a great proposition right
now because for the same price as a you
know four core six core i5 you can get
six cores and twelve threads with little
Rison alright okay my friend okay is
that someone says Paul Kuan says is
rising to more compatible and stable
with RAM because of the chip because of
the actual CPU or the chipset the 4400
series that's a good question Paul I
have a feeling because the architecture
the the jump I have a feeling it's got
to do a little bit with both I'm not the
research that a bit more but I don't
think that chipset has as much to do
with it as the actual architecture of
the CPU because we did have a node
change from rising first gen to seconds
so I'm gonna lean a little more towards
the the chip itself the CPU itself being
more or less the cause but I will do my
research and get back Tia all right
someone says and video encoding is this

now it's so good does it look does it
seriously look any better I don't know
if you guys can even tell
but yeah I'm encoding right now with nvm
and C so we will see how how this stacks
up and I think what I'm gonna do is go
back and look at both live streams
yesterday's in today's and just see if I
notice any artifacting with one or the
other and kind of weigh those pros and
cons so if this looks great you guys let
me know that's a good idea
Paul definitely make a video I don't
want to do the research regarding that
question of yours by the way okay Chad
schwa if you're gonna ask me to answer
your question you should probably put
the question in the comment that you're
asking me to answer the question in
because I don't and I don't see your
question in the in the chat right now
I'm scrolling down I'm scrolling down
here we have an f-14 flier seven how do
you
price older computers for resale I'm
trying to sell my old PC for roughly 330
or so just don't know if that's a fair
price to ask look the only way you can
really get an idea of what you should be
asking is by looking elsewhere the first
place I go is eBay I check eBay for the
same components that most of the time
they're being resold right they're not
new and you can actually you know narrow
down your search inquiry by selecting
only used components for resale type in
your exact component see what the
average price is that these things are
going for and then I would kind of place
my total system you know sale value
somewhere in that range so take the kind
of a the mean of each part price that
you see on eBay for a used system add
all those prices together and then you
know kind of play up or down with it
from there depending on your exact
market because not all markets are the
same so you could have to play it by ear
you know price that what you think you'd
sell it for if it's a little too cheap
if you're if you have to sell a little
too cheap to finally get people to start
asking about it then you know you might
not want to sell it yet so it really
depends see yet see here mmm
I'm not I'm reading some comments that
are enticed other questions so thank you
guys for doing that I appreciate that
okay bland paloma hey Greg I want to
know your thoughts on how many years
minimum
you think you need to upgrade your
system with all this Specter and
meltdown problem I have a 6700 K right
now he's asking when he thinks the
upgrade will be needed and I don't think
I would base my upgrade decision solely
on specter and meltdown like they have
patches for those things I would say if
you noticed a huge you know performance
cut when you had these Windows updates
and all these software buddies trying to
cover up those patches are those those
flaws in the system and the architecture
if you noticed that those those things
were crippling your system then yeah I
might be pretty pissed off and I want to
go buy something else but it's I don't
think that inspector and meltdown would
justify my my personal upgrade pad I
don't I would I wouldn't be you know it
was like a totally like your systems
completely vulnerable and you're getting
just hacked you know like crazy your
identity is getting stolen all this
crazy
you know if you're experiencing that
kind of stuff obviously it's a terrible
issue but you know what we saw with
windows and and what we've seen with
these these micro updates and BIOS
updates is that this has pretty much
been locked down I wouldn't say it's a
super pertinent issue in the sense that
you're gonna you know lose your identity
but if you're I mean you know if you're
worried about it you have every right to
be worried about it it shouldn't have
happened in the first place
then you know yeah sure update but in
general updating a PC like that with a
6700k I would say every three or four
years that's that's what I would that's
what I would say on average three to
four years is a healthy upgrade you know
kind of system every three or four Lord
vile asks vive or a rift I am slightly
biased because I first tested the vibe
and I tried the what was it I tried the
rift the oculus rift at Best Buy and I
thought it was cool I didn't really
notice much of a difference the headset
I mean it looked different right in but
I can really see pixels with the vibe I
really can see pixels like it's pretty
obvious but at the same time it I'm more
or less worried about feeling nauseous
with that headset and I don't feel
nauseous when when I wear the oculus or
not the office when I wear the vibe it
feels a little more comfortable to me I
like the controllers more from the vibe
and you know I think the setup with the
vibe is a little nicer it's a little
more friendly
you only need those like wall to towers
right and it's basically it so I I've
had more experience with the vibe and I
think I stuck with the vibe because I
was satisfied with it to begin with I
didn't feel the need to jump to the rift
because I was already happy to begin
with with what HTC had to offer so
unknown element favorite keyboard scroll
back in the live stream I answered that
question
MK 750 from coolermaster max Edward
asked his YouTube your main job Greg yes
it is as of right now it is my main job
I will be finishing school pretty soon
and and then from there I'm not sure
because I'll have an engineering degree
and then I'll have my masters in
business on top of that and I would feel
pretty dirty to not have to use those
I feel like you know I don't I don't
feel like they should be treated as
fallbacks per se like if my youtube
channel suddenly died tomorrow right I
would have something to fall back on but
I don't think that an engineering degree
is just something to take that lightly
because it was hard work I mean it
really was and I was putting you know
putting the channel together at the same
time so I really had no life my last
three years in college and with this the
MBA I'm doing online right now it's a
lot easier because I can kind of pace
myself and work around my work schedule
here on YouTube but I've I've often
contemplated going back into just the
regular work force and you know you get
benefits retirement insurance the good
stuff and you don't get those things
with YouTube you don't I mean you got to
do you know outside you got to do Roth
IRAs and all kinds of other things if
you want life insurance health insurance
that stuff's expensive it ain't cheap
here it's not really cheap really
anywhere unless you live in a socialist
country and then you pay for it other
way other way so anyway okay I see mr. M
with current prices on PC parts which is
the better buy a laptop or desktop I
don't think that you know if you if
you're asking yourself whether you
should buy a desktop or a laptop then
you're probably not passionate enough to
want to spend the extra money to get a
desktop a fully properly built desktop
so if you're asking that question I
would say just get a laptop you're gonna
be happier with the money saved and you
can take it wherever you want but I I
know for one that I would not be
complacent with having just a gaming
laptop I would hate how loud they get I
would hate just how bulky a lot of them
are I don't like the screens on a lot of
laptops the keyboards or you usually
trash you know you still got to bring
peripherals with you like you still
gotta bring a mouse if you're gaming
with an ultrabook you gotta bring the
full-on GPU enclosure you know I I just
I just find beauty in a desktop that
sits on my desk as it should and because
I treat my PC bill it's like I do
artwork this is my art i express it in
this way and then I use an ultrabook for
anything I need to do outside the office
and I have a MacBook specifically
because I can still content create with
the MacBook using Final Cut Pro and
iMovie with their built-in quick sync or
equivalent functions which is a much
better way to edit on the go then with a
Windows equivalent like Adobe Premiere
Pro editing an Adobe Premiere Pro with a
Dell XPS 13 or you know a 13-inch
spectre x360 from HP or whatever it's
it's so much worse so and that's why
he's a MacBook only go but I couldn't
imagine carrying a bulky gaming laptop I
really couldn't a dark Vador asks are
you enthusiastic I think that's what you
meant to say are you enthusiastic about
rising 7 nanometer
I don't know if I should be or not I
know nothing about it I don't really
like to read rumors I don't know enough
about it to even be excited yet but I'm
sure it's gonna be a pretty sweet step
in the right direction and hopefully
it's a much bigger jump than what we saw
from Horizons first gen 2 second gen 2nd
gen improved a lot of things that needed
to be improved but I don't think that
the overall performance jump from the
first gen to 2nd gen was just a file
right for an upgrade and that's what
we're looking for with the next stuff
coming out proper rising to architecture
14 flyers f-14 flier 7 asks why don't
you use twitch to stream simple because
I don't have a lot of twitch followers
and a lot of them aren't subscribed or
not subscribed but they're not like
they're not signed up you know to
receive notifications when I go live
they're not following me basically and I
have what three hundred and fifty eight
thousand subs here so I pull a much
bigger audience on YouTube
I could simultaneously stream to twitch
and YouTube but I'd rather follow it all
in one way I you know I think that this
is a this is a better format for what I
do normally anyway okay I see I'm gonna
go through quick super chats here leavin
Castillo donated $2 to the super chat
thank you for that your advice from your
last livestream helped thank you
awesome I'm not sure what advice you're
talking about but I'm glad that you were
and glad that it helped you out that's
that's what these things are for I try
to fill in the gaps if you guys have any
and if I notice gaps in my
thinking or train of thought when you
guys ask questions I don't know about
and it's just a motivation for me to go
and research the topic at hand so we
both get to learn the people's need
that's a weird name donated five
Canadian thank you to that super chat
ever considered doing an EDC video
thanks for the quality content as usual
and I'm totally gonna totally gonna look
that up I don't know what the heck that
is
EDC Electric Daisy Carnival is that is
that what you mean by EDC I feel
terrible I don't know what a DC is I've
never heard of that but sure I mean if
I've got the opportunity I'm sure it
would drue be Greg how do I talk to a
girl I like without being flirting all
right look my dude here here's here's
how it works you want to talk you guys
all just all of you just gotta listen to
this short quick all right as someone
who is uh newly married okay I would say
I have just tiny just a tiny bit of
experience in this all right and I'm not
I'm not a Ladykiller I can't pick up
chicks whenever I want you know like we
all have our flaws and the things that
hold us back but here's one thing that a
woman definitely likes and that's
confidence but not being so confident
that you come off like an asshole right
yeah there's a certain limit to that you
don't want to come off like this cocky
dude who you know thinks he can get
whatever he wants because then she's
gonna play hard-to-get if she even wants
you to begin with and then the other
thing I would say is you know you want
to plant seeds you don't want to take a
huge step up front and make them think
you know that's meats so obviously
you're flirting that she's just she's
gonna make up her mind right then and
there should I give this guy my time of
day or should I just you know ignore him
and if she chooses the latter if she
chooses to ignore you you're gonna have
a huge uphill battle to climb after that
so what you got to do what you someone
says you lie and pretend to be something
you're not
Palestine pleasing god I'm the real
here's the real deal tip here right
plant the seeds you know smile don't
don't act like you're this this hermit
who's super shy you could totally play
that if you really wanted you could you
know tell a girl she looks pretty or
Taylor that's nice meter small
and then just walk away right and then
you could be that stalker from a
distance and see if she ever looks back
at you again but then you're leaving
that you're leaving your fate with that
person you know significant other in her
hands or his hands depending on how
you're looking at this so if you're
confident enough you don't have to do
that if you're not as confident if
you're a little on edge you're just you
just you know I'm not too sure yet if I
can pick this chick up and you know I
you don't want to come across too strong
then just like I said plant the seeds
compliment her give her one compliment
and then walk away right and if she
comes back up to you and then she's
interested now if she doesn't come back
up to you then maybe that means you got
to give the seed a little water okay you
got it you gotta soak it up a little bit
walk back up to her talk about something
completely random you want to get her
thinking about you she's not gonna think
about you if you say one word to her
you're gonna be another person that she
sees in her day and she's never gonna
make a mental note or a mental image of
your face okay but you want your
encounters to be kind of like stepping
stones they're the seeds that eventually
sprout into this beautiful garden that
you have to continuously water and work
at to keep beautiful but you can't have
a beautiful garden without planting the
seeds so the small steps up the front
matter be confident enough to compliment
her to talk to her in the first place
because if you don't talk to her you're
not gonna get anywhere with her right
you know you got to be confident enough
to do that so you guys you're really
taking this too I've read some of you
comments I see it some of y'all like
thinking the seeds things funny but
that's how I I mean I'm trying to use a
metaphor analogy because I other than
just shooting straight with you and
telling you to man up and just walk up
to her and talk to her if you're just a
little shy and you're not as confident
then you gotta work at it one step at a
time at your pace don't come across too
uncomfortable you can be a little giddy
you can act a little dumb she might
think that's cute she might not you got
to feel it out you know the sea might
not eat any water at all but you might
have to soak the thing in water so you
know you never know especially if you
meet a girl for the first time you've
never met her
where you don't know how she is this is
a girl you've you've known for a long
time and now you want to pick her up
then you probably have a good idea of
what she likes and what she doesn't
already and you already have an
advantage
the disadvantage though is that she
knows you too she knows you as much as
you know her so she's already got this
predisposition in your head about who
you are and you have to convince her
that you're dating material so either
way yeah you're gonna have you're gonna
have a struggle for sure it's not gonna
be easy but if it was easy it wouldn't
in my opinion be fun you're supposed to
work at these things that's that every
relationship is just a work in progress
even when you're married that's when the
real job begins that's when it gets
really tough and you know you just gotta
you just got to be patient and you got
to be diligent and you got to be
confident forbidden office derby at Tech
yes City how about you and science
studio and do a collaboration video we
talked about this in the beginning of
the stream I invite you to rewind the
stream you can always come back live
later I talked about that in the
beginning so let yeah let me know which
what you hear if you have any other
questions ok I see
shun shun are Shannara gnar gnar gnar
that's a lovely name I have an 8 core
AMD FX processor running at about 4
gigahertz overclocked and hyper-threaded
to 4 cores hyper threaded at four cores
I'm confused
there's no hyper threading and
technically the fx8 core CPUs are not a
Whore CPUs I've done like a full-on like
like just fabrication process breakdown
of that architecture you should watch
that video type in like you know FX
processors how many cores do they have
my videos should be one of the first
ones to come up go check it out I talked
about that breakdown but I'm not sure
exactly where you're going with the
hyper threaded thing because you don't
technically have hyper if that's an
Intel proprietary thing do you think I
should go further but the overclock if
you can if your temps allow you to go
further and you're not pushing your
voltage to insane levels one point I
don't remember what it is for FX but I
would say one point four it's usually
like a pretty safe cutoff don't go above
that in most cases then you are gonna be
fine with that overclock okay NAND vagus
eeeh
what is the difference between psu and
SMP SPS PSU in SMPS I don't mmm I don't
know it's kind of a weird question
I do not know or an S&amp;amp;P even is I
probably do I've just never used it and
it's annotated for him SMP symmetric
multiprocessing processing of programs
by multiple processors that share a
common operating system oh it's okay
symmetric multiprocessing I don't know
what PSU is an SMP zyk totally different
I don't know what you're trying to bring
up from that question you've asked my
question quite a bit in this chat but I
don't know why you're asking it because
it's they're totally different a simple
Google search could answer that question
for you does monitor Hertz affect how
many FPS he gives whatfox yes the answer
is yes you need to watch refresh rate
verse fps I have a video on that you
type it in and then just put science
studio after it you'll find my video
regarding the two refresh rate limits
the amount of fps you see FPS limits the
it doesn't limit your refresh rate on
your screen but the FPS is ultimately
your your that's your cap right no
matter what you're not gonna see more
than your FPS even if you have a higher
refresh rate monitor the framerate
you're receiving you might even have
stuttering because the refresh rates
aren't synced up perfectly with your
frame rates being called from the
graphics card and that's where you get
stuttering and stuff I also talked about
that in a separate video but yeah your
refresh rate will limit it so if you
have a 60 Hertz panel and then your your
graphics card wants to push 100 frames
to your to your screen you're only gonna
see 60 max basically okay we have can
you speak fluent German no I cannot
speak fluent German I actually can't
even oh I see you guys are saying he
means snps or SP SP ms you spelled it
wrong cyber shark s mps you guys are
confusing the heck out of me MSC
switched-mode power supply let you start
it converts power using switching
devices that are turned on and off high
frequencies I've never even heard of it
so I can answer your question but I will
research it I've never heard of SPS ever
so that's new for me okay I saw
something about
am I gonna screw up here I was reading
something and I'm gonna lost it I lost
it dark Vador what's your favorite PC
case brand I already told you my
favorite PC case is the piece in the PC
11 dynamic from Lee and Lee another
favorite case is the mesh spicy again I
have videos on both of those okay Ronnie
asks if the megahertz of your let me see
here if the megahertz of your CPU rises
to cold rice is too cold should the
video card be paired to the RAM squared
yeah the answer is yes 2200 G thoughts
from Nico I think it's a great ultra
budget value proposition I have tested
them I don't have results on the channel
yet because I was kind of late to the
party
ambi sent us pretty late so yeah I think
they're viable I think a 2400 G has
definitely uh it definitely has a place
the 2200 G still has a place but it I
don't know it's it's it's sometimes it's
not enough I'll leave it at that but you
guys know if you see benchmarks anywhere
you know the difference between the two
and the value implied with both Cypress
asked so I took off the thermal paste on
my CPU and replaced it with okay that's
a hide on the channel check yeah City
hey Greg Weston were swingin SMG and
what's going on Brian oh geez oh that's
good I've never I've never heard of an
SMPS I never have until this point so
I'm actually curious a switch mode power
supply it's kind of a interesting topic
but I don't know enough about it to even
comment on it so we will see we will see
someone asked what my ethnicity is I am
Hispanic okay Ronny no I I know I know
you were kidding Ronny I know you're
kidding it's all good don't worry the
deranged gamer hey well a 300 watt power
supply be enough for a 1060 I five sixty
four hundred and twelve gigs of ddr3
cutting it awfully close you're probably
going to be in your safe zone but in the
upper edge 300 watts is like dads that's
very
I would try I would try to get something
bigger than that because you you might
you might not have enough I'm not sure
exactly what the 10 60 pulls under load
but I imagine it's gonna be over 100
watts probably closer to 150 just off
the top of my head you know 6400 gonna
pull around 70 80 at you know peak
spikes right under load so you're
already pretty close to your threshold I
would I would say you're probably safe
but going for a 400 watt power supply is
gonna set you up that much better a 400
or 430 watt power supply is is perfect
for that build if you're just looking
for something that's low profile and not
too expensive okay yeah scrolling back
up - up up up up up up up a BA all caps
is pissed cause I didn't answer his
question but he doesn't realizes there's
like 50 other people asking questions he
thinks he's entitled to have his
question answered or for everyone else
so he left I guess I'm so sorry all caps
I'm sorry that you're not the only one
in the chat thankfully you guys are uh
patient I'm trying to get through all
this stuff except for all caps he's not
a patient take a city I will confirm
this at Computex all right he's gonna
confirm it you guys need to catch up on
the on the inside scoop going on in
there all right we have about 370 people
watching not bad for Sunday night you
guys are awesome we have a lot of so
you're sitting in the SLE mm right
what's your height weight I'm about five
nine five ten 130 140 pounds or so I'm
pretty small guys this fits perfect for
me for my frame and you have smaller
frames so this is great for that if you
want the bigger cherry and go for
something bigger than the SLE mm the
great thing is vertigo has many options
but this chair is extremely comfortable
my Nova it's not eleven thirty where I
live
you're not the only time zone so for
some people like people on the west
coast it's only 8:30 p.m.
nah huh that's see that's how time zones
work DB in X 1701 what are your thoughts
on net neutrality I literally have a
video talking about net neutrality so
just type in net neutrality science
studio there's your answer that question
hey there's Chris Katz inverted gears
awesome that Chris is totally not
bias I'm totally not it's all good
trucker bomb thanks for mining about
discord questions thank you for that
good saw okay alright oh right on ball
asking me to mod you I don't see oddball
where are you
someone's asking why I have Christmas
lights still up don't be a hater I like
Christmas lights they're good all day
all year round
cyber shark it's not Monday where I live
so Sunday night so ha we have a couple
questions here I wanna ask from the
discord if you guys want to join the
discord it is open you can do so it's
linked in like my most recent videos
it's it's linked down there actually
Brian from tech yes City and I both
share that discord and we do have
special rules for sponsors if you're a
youtube sponsor or if you're a page
around supporter for both of our
channels as well and you do have like
certain hierarchies and distinctions in
the discord for those special supporters
so if you want to ask questions via
discord you can certainly do it as well
it's less cluttered right now than the
live stream is you're the live chat in
particular okay so beta 2017 s are you
and lioness on good terms if so have you
brought up a collab idea I have I met
Linus I didn't say a single word to him
I don't think I met him last year copy
text Jakob McLovin talk to me to Linus
visit but they were talking about phones
or something but I haven't said a single
word to Linus ever so I don't even know
I don't know I'm sure he has some kind
of impression of me if he even knows I
exist I would be totally down for
anything like that but I don't think
he's gonna ask a channel my size to do
anything with him it's just the the uh
the you know the in equivalencies there
with like the PR it's just gonna benefit
me way more than it would ever benefit
him so I don't blame him for not doing
something like that okay T bomb what's
your opinion on all-male bathhouses
interesting question I mean it depends
like are you confident in yourself
are you a confident male do you have
masculinity how would people approaches
wow I'm just trying to like throw out
some questions here to respond to your
question I'm pretty coming out all-male
bath house is kind of weird on the
surface not sure if I would just be cool
with like walking in on one oh no what
do you guys think let me know in the
chat box
okay I see forbidden office derby
honestly I think it's very under
channel please keep up the fantastic
content much appreciated my dude I
really appreciate that
okay ztg gaming a good question yo
fallout 4 isn't using all my system
resources a 720p lowest settings with an
i-5 6400 750ti 12 gigs of DRAM I get 30
fps and my GPU is only at 20% my CP sits
around 50% please help your gaming at a
really low resolution and I mean
relatively speaking and your gaming at a
very low in-game setting so you're
putting a lot of stress I imagine on
your CPU again not sure why you see bees
only maxed at like 50% it might have to
do with optimization but fallout 4 is
not I'm pretty sure fallout 4 uses more
than two cores effectively I don't you
guys let me know I've never been smart
fallout 4 so that would be where I would
have to ask the question anyway Cody so
like what's going on thanks Cody for
sponsoring us I see trucker Bom aka T
BOM and discord I see him in here
I see oddball now I see him I am making
you a moderator oddball is one of our
admins in the discord server again if
you'd like to join that check out the
last couple videos in the description we
have a link to the discord shared
between tech ES City and I okay I
scrolled down too buh-buh-buh-buh
looking for the good stuff Drago Drago
Fang 1060 says fallout 4 pushes my
system to its limits not the CP or GPU
but my hard disk drive so it might just
be an optimization issue I would suggest
bumping your in-game settings you
certainly can do that with your
configuration whoever asked that
question earlier about fallout 4 okay
bezel asks do you ever find it hard to
be in between our GB software's I'm
confused and to be in between our to be
something you mean like to use multiple
programs to control different RGB things
I'm kind of confused as to what you're
asking I like the I like the one that
like just lets you combine everything
Corsair has a software like that I'm
pretty sure Thermaltake is coming on the
software like that if they haven't
already released it we covered something
similar to that at CES this year so any
software that can unify multiple
platforms or more
two products from different companies
I'm all for it because I hate having
five or six different RGB programs on my
desktop just big waste of time okay
let's see yeah all right
the question from calm calm I missed I
lost it oh I lost it here we go
count traveller this is good calm
traveller his question is with a
horizontal motherboard okay so turn long
ways I guess and two rads in the top
okay
how important is tipping the case every
which way
I'm confused it would depend on where
your radiators like where your tubing
runs come from the radio where your
ports are so what I've experienced is
that if you have a radiator that sits
upright right and your ports on the
radiator or the highest point of your
system it's gonna be a pain to get those
air pockets out you're gonna flip your
case upside down and then upside down
again all the while keeping your pump on
preferably is it'll accelerate those air
bubbles mean push through the loop you
want to get those into your reservoir
and if your reservoirs it'll lower point
your system then the top of your rat is
where those ports are then you're gonna
have some gaps you might even have air
just kind of hang out in the tubes up
top when you especially when you turn
your system off you know when you're
when you're the pressure and a whole
loop isn't equalized so I'm not sure
what your orientation specifically is is
beckoning but you'll probably have to
flip your case around more than once
just because that's custom loose yeah if
you want to have a fully primed system
you've got to flip the thing around
that's just how it is
noggin that $2 super chat I'm using I
see graphite pad on my cpu opinions
I see graphite oh you're using the pad
yeah I want to know about this I saw
this I think it was Linus or somebody
who did this video and I was really
curious about it because I've done a
thermal pad before like just a pad you
put over like you know the RAM modules
or whatever and those aren't the
greatest obviously there's not meant for
the same kind of a transfer so I'm
curious how effective this thing
actually is if it's better or worse
then then just typical thermal paste I
imagine it's got to be pretty sweet
because it's like the new hype thing
right now so we'll see I might buy a one
and can even buy one are they all right
now so you might get my hands on one and
I'll test it out cuz it looks pretty
sweet it looks pretty cool it looks like
it's a perfect size for a risin IHS so
and it's reusable interesting okay
someone asked rusty Shackelford greg how
is will doing haven't heard from him in
a while will is in discord all the time
so if you want to join the public
discord you can do that and you can talk
to will directly just at not will that's
his name not will but it's actually will
so if you want to bother him on there
you certainly do that it would be pretty
funny to watch so just give him crap
Nathan Trin our GP prices dropping
Nathan you you can figure this out just
as quickly as I can just google this
stuff an Amazon Newegg looking graphics
our prices I think we can safely say
they're coming down are they back to
where they should be
no they're kind of around MSRP right now
they should be dropping a little lower
we've been on the same Pascal
architecture now for what two years
almost so yeah they should be lower than
MSRP but right now they're much better
than what they used to be right about
six months or so ago okay by the way
noggin think of it that super chat and I
think you for that recommendation
because it looks pretty sweet I can't
wait to test this pad honestly it just
it's something that I think it's so like
blatantly obvious this should have
existed a long time ago that now that is
suddenly becoming a thing we're testing
graphite thermal pad interesting we had
a Sunday okay
Bosch sir zero asked science to do did

battlefield 5 coming out soon honestly
never really been a huge fan of
battlefield that was more ways I was
always more of a Call of Duty gamer but
that was when consoles were like that
was my thing was playing at console I
used PCs for other stuff but not
necessarily games I never had a really
powerful gaming PC so I never really
found the urge to do that but
battlefield 5 I don't know I mean I
played battlefield was it a battlefield
1 this is the new one a brain fart but
the latest one that came out right based
on world war jeez world war one I think
it was a World War one I'm I'm out of
the loop anyway that tells you how much
I know about battlefield I've just I
haven't been as big a fan of it as I
have Call of Duty just because I grew up
playing Call of Duty so you know I was I
was groomed that way but in with respect
to black ops 4 I don't think it's gonna
do very well I really don't I think
they're think they're too late to the
Battle Royale game
so we'll see ok Jarett Hut Huddleston I
started overclocking my GPU and did all
my stress testing with fur mark and it
was stable on fur mark when I tested
more than 20 minutes I feel like I read
that out of context totally read that
out of context thanks for that's not a
question okay anyway Andrew launched do
you think the price of be 350 boards
will go down after be 450 comes out and
if so will they be the budget sweet spot
or or will you be missing out on future
compatibility or worthwhile features I
mean that the features part you can
figure out in five seconds by looking at
the comparisons when B 450 is available
but right now B 350 is still perfectly
fine in with regards to the other party
or question with price I think B 350 is
already priced super competitively I
don't expect price to fall much more not
in the new market in the use market sure
I think we'll find plenty of B 30 boards
in the use market motherboards are
pretty good most of the time to buy
second hand just you know double check
up front especially if you're buying an
Intel board that the pins are good to
ask for a picture specifically of the
socket and then preferably of the system
working with the motherboard and
that's that's that's cute you know you
can do that too with a CPU but that
that's what I would say
Richard Meadows don't look at the
discord link the discord link is in my
actual videos don't check like the Q&amp;amp;A
that the QA we just do last minute but
check my actual videos my recent videos
discord link is in there okay see says
you should try it again cod will always
do well I don't think cod i cons
definitely dead on pc i would safely say
that i think the only people playing
like i downloaded modern warfare 2 and
played that and it's very it's it's cool
the remastered stuff might rejuvenate
things especially for the older school
games like modern warfare and in black
ops the original black ops but I don't
think Call of Duty has a big place
anymore on PC because the trends on PC
shifts so quickly so that that's just my
take on it ok can you plug SATA one into
a SATA 2 port say say to 1 and 2 SATA 2
I'm confused as to what you're talking
you're talking about just like switching
up your ports like having an a you know
an SSD plugged into one port and then
switching and plugging in a second port
usually your bios and new motherboards
pretty smart about figuring out what
drives your boot drive I'm not sure we
talking about there that you can run
like a SATA 3 and it's a 2 6 like 6 your
talk about like 3 megabytes per gigabyte
so I don't know I'm kind of confused as
what you're asking
kind of open-ended question ok here we
go a pack army is i how much first gen x
56 50 or 8th gen like 8600 k in gaming
and working Oh what's the difference
between the first gen and the H and
right cuz they're at 64 okay that's an
interesting question
the 5650 that sounds like a question for
Brian if Brian's still watching you
should definitely ask Brian that
question because I haven't actually
personally tested the 5650 now but I'm
sure there's not a huge difference I'm
sure that if anything there's probably I
would say between clock for clock maybe
a 20% 25% difference with most games
frame rate wise you're limited by other
things as well like your RAM and
a few other things but in most cases
from the first gen Intel stuff like
we're talking like you know i7 first gen
- right the 8000 series i7 I think that
there's gonna be about a 30 or 20 to 30
percent Delta and frame rates is my
thing
mark Dave and port we talked about sed
key in the last livestream so click on
the last livestream on my half it's it's
after-hours number 12 we talk about sta
keep specifically there I don't ever go
through all that again but I know if I
believe that they were money-laundering
I would not have promoted them the idea
that they are as in that I think that
they are as absurd so whoever planted
that day that idea in your mind is that
I don't know why they're saying that the
gamer Greg I believe you will be going
to Taiwan for context so the question
would you try to do comparison between
Intel hades Canyon and small form-factor
computer I gonna get my hands on Hades
Canyon more than likely so I don't know
why me going to come beat X would be
grounds for testing that stuff be I will
be going to cut to Taiwan I'm actually
flying to Switzerland I'm gonna see Lisa
in Germany for about a week and then
we're flying to Taiwan together and then
we're coming back for about another four
or five days and then we'll be back home
but yeah
Takia City Brian says I noticed
basically no difference once overclocked
versus an 8400 and a risin 5 2600 with a
1080i
yeah and that's more than likely because
the what I I wonder what Brian was
testing and I think he was overclocked
the 56:15 it goes so hard yeah that's
what I was looking for I was looking for
that one yeah and the reason why with my
testing I used a 1070 TI instead of a
1080 TI for the i5 versus r5 question is
because I don't think many people are
gonna buy an i5 8400 and then buy a 1080
T I like to me that just doesn't make
much sense so I try to scale the
graphics card with the price of the CPU
in most cases ok noggin 2 dolla it's on
my 8600 K temps are worse idle than on
load that's super weird I know it sounds
like it's sounds like a software issue I
would
garrison the yeah used okay so he was
talking about SATA one literally say to
one and sata2 and say to three
so say to 360 gibbets per second and
that's what you're gonna have a most
modern board say two to three gigs that
that's back I would say all the top of
my head LGA 775 territory
so if you're if you're back on you know
q 6600 stuff you're gonna be SATA to and
but you can run a SATA to you you can
they're usually backwards compatible
imited more or less by this SATA
interface itself this is gonna be your
limiting factor so stepping down isn't a
problem Jake Martin hey I would just
like to take a second thank you I have
been a fan for almost a year now you
bring so much joy to not only me but my
family as well so thank you very much
keep up the good work well I appreciate
that Jake I don't know what I exactly
said to bring you joy to your family but
that's awesome that's a that's
definitely needed I appreciate that seal
Freddy five have you ever done a build
in a case labs case like the mercury sa
no I have not I don't have a case labs
uh I don't have a case labs contact and
at this point like if I if I really feel
like I need to build in something I'll
just buy the case but I I don't think
most of my builds I like to compact
stuff like the super compact cases like
the mesh if I see the case loves cases
tend to be a bit bigger so I'd have to
have a really extravagant bill to fill
up all that extra space and a bigger
case labs case so it would be a really
big and daunting water-cooling project
in the works let's see uh i bojangles
what's up both while you were gone to
Computex i'll drive your car around and
make sure nothing rots from sitting ah I
got you there that will feel stabilizer
literally added today so a good game but
really tried anyway but you should come
over before I leave so if you're free I
know you work Monday through Friday most
of the time but if you find a free
afternoon or whatever stop by let's
chill that place and pub G or something
okay bird asks what case would you live
to build in yeah I don't know yet I have
built in pretty much any case that I've
that I've seen that like I'm like I
gotta have it I got a building that I
love the s340 elite I love the aged 440
I'm gonna be a I love the H 700 I i love
the mesh fic define see the define our
city
I love the fantex p400 I love the PCO 11
dynamic those are some of the cases off
top my head that I really love building
in I can't think of anything else that I
like I haven't built in yet that I would
love to though maybe maybe like a cool
in win case like I really just you know
out there crazy looking case I know
cougar has a case like that a lot of the
bigger tech tubers that built in those
but and I think cougar actually spawn
I'm pretty sure they paid the music's
cases I don't know they might have but a
lot of them use it at the same time so
unless they just pushed him and just you
know said here if you want a built in
the building I don't blame them but uh I
just found it weird that so many of them
were building it at the same time in
that case looks really cool and so yeah
I would say a case like that that's like
just super weird the deep cool quad
stellar is a super weird case I can't
wait to build in that we're waiting on
some of wills components before we do
but yeah that would be pretty sweet as
well okay
cold oh she gave me sis wait Brian's
here yeah Brian's here he's in the chat
you gotta check him out he's actually
answer some questions to questions that
he's more fit to answer anyway we're
getting used parts especially zap pod
beeblebrox donated a $10 due to super
chat gaming only arises in 1800 extra
rig 280 millimeter AI Oh does it make
sense to run my IO on my GPU that's a
1080 blower versus my CPU considering
the minimal overclocking Headroom h7 on
CPU does just fine at 10.35 yeah yeah if
you have a 1080 blower I think that
would be so much more annoying than not
being able to overclock my 1800 X which
is gonna be capped more or less anyway
to about 4 gigahertz yeah if you if
you're willing to buy like a g12 crack
and bracket or something from NZXT
mounts at age 15 cooler - it actually is
that still an ASA tech pump I don't if
it's a sick pump I actually don't think
it is I don't think it's compatible
we'll see somebody will know in the chat
check the chat but I haven't actually
tested the age 15 8 115 yet so you got
to see about that but yeah in general I
would feel more comfortable water
cooling my graphics card and just
sticking in age 7 you know from cryo
wriggle on there because it's gonna do
just fine I'm actually using an h7 quad
lumi for my 8700 k so there's something
ok scrolling down scrolling down
scrolling down
Gregg does Computex hold a special
meaning to you now I definitely does I
talk about this release all the time
because that's where I met her
and I went to copy text expecting to be
totally you know synced into business
just focusing on videos it was a
business trip literally I mean we were
having fun there at same time never been
on that side of the world but I met Lisa
there for those you don't know Lisa's my
wife now and she she definitely made it
much more enjoyable and it's gonna be
really cool going back with her this
time he's actually like around the time
that we met so it's kind of like our one
year meeting anniversary and we just got
married so we've known each other for
about a year I didn't waste any time I
knew she was the one and we got engaged
and we got married and right now we're
apart because she's German and I'm a US
citizen so there's that struggle ahead
we're working on that right now she's
getting her name change and all the good
stuff and then we will be will be
trucking away okay I see both eyeballs
asking me go check out the same link app
steam link app I'll do that in a
separate video I don't do that a live
stream
Richard Meadows have to look for horizon
to series compatible sticker for be 350
compatibility I paid a shop to update
BIOS hmm excuse me online for 2,200 G or
you could just see if AMD will send you
one of those BIOS upgrade kits listen
you're like a dud CP to let you boot
into your BIOS so if you wanted
something like that to you could do that
and not have to worry about whether or
not there's a you know risin to series
branding on beat 50 boards which it's
gonna be tough to find it can be very
few be through 50 boards out there
they're an openly support rising to out
of the box with the updated you afi's
Shahir McKenzie ask greg is a 60 Hertz
all is a 60 Hertz ultra wide worth it no
g-sync release Inc I think 60 Hertz
anything is a compromise even if you're
going for a 4k display yeah it's gonna
look super sweet you're gonna have a
really high you know pixel per inch
density but I hate 60 Hertz no I'm on a
240 Hertz panel and when I go from a 240
Hertz panel to a 165 Hertz panel right
next to me I can see the difference and
then when I go from 165 Hertz panel to
my
panel in the other room I see an even
bigger difference and I go from 100
Hertz to 60 Hertz and it literally hurts
my eyes so when you get used to to
something higher than 60 Hertz it's
really hard to go back down if you've
been used to 60 Hertz for a long time
then I strongly recommend for going an
ultra wide format for something that's
got a higher refresh rate if even if you
have to stick with 1080p go for a 1080p
120 or 140 Hertz panel it will make a
huge difference I guarantee it
I think it'll be much better than an
ultra wide aspect ratio
Brent r is gaming Greg is there a reason
why whenever I update my graphics driver
my third monitor gets all screwy and I
have to do a lot of resolution scaling
to fix it also where do babies come from
you guys are good I'll give you that you
guys are pretty good so to answer your
first question which is where I will
keep this this discussion you know where
babies come from that would be probably
it's it might be a conflict between
Windows display settings and your in
video display settings assuming here's
an Nvidia card or if using you know AMD
crimson really drivers whatever their
newest driver is it could just be a
conflict between the control panel from
Nvidia or the windows display settings
right when you right-click on your
desktop so I would double check both of
those make sure they're lined up because
if they're conflicting at all then yeah
it might mess up your third if your
third screen especially they're setting
up three screens is a lot more painful
in setting up two just gives you have
that third variable and you will have
conflicts
yeah sell your windows up to where they
scale appropriately but I wouldn't worry
too much about it yeah I McLovin passed
away or hip right where that come from
oh geez oh man that's pretty good okay I
have a Taven owl Bisson totally
butchered that but anyway hey do you
think it would be cool to build an AMD
Rison system with a 2200 G with an Rx
480 in the Corsair Bulldog 16 gigs of
3200 Ram why would you want a 2200 G
with an artist 480 do you want to try to
d I don't know exactly what you're
trying to do I mean I'm not even sure
whether or not you know how you could do
with the old school stuff at the old
school ap use like the a10 AP use you
could crossfire that with the you know
r9 270 and one I don't even know if you
can do that with a newer stuff if you
can't do it don't buy the 2200 G it's
completely pointless I would try to pair
the 480 with it least an r5 try to
scrape out the extra for an r5 but if
you got the right idea that going for
the higher frequency Ram just make sure
that Ram is gonna actually be compatible
right you're not gonna have issues
getting to that frequency with Rison
first chance summit ridge is a pain when
it comes to ram 2nd gen rising totally
clear that up XMP profile boom it's all
ready to go much better
basically like Intel at this point ok
Taurus Taurus brain Taurus brain asked
at science studio ever thought about
working for a computer company if so
which one I don't even know I think I
put in an application for a Corsair
position just that at one point just
it's just to like see just to mess
around and I don't I didn't get anything
back from them they probably they
probably think it's a conflict of
interest and I wouldn't blame them so I
think it would be contingent if I ever
wanted to work with with a particular
let's say I wanted to work at NZXT I
would have to be very careful with
especially my case reviews and any
sponsor build in general I think there
would be a very blatant and open
conflict of interest yeah plenty of
people work in the industry and have
YouTube channels they've done it before
but I I just feel like it would
compromise a few I feel like a few
people would look at it as like a
compromise especially when it comes to
case reviews and I value case reviews I
think you know we have a certain way of
doing things with cases when it comes to
putting those videos together those
builds together those reviews together
and I'm just not sure I'm willing to
give that up or cut into my credibility
when it comes to that by working with a
company that I often work with anyway on
the side so not know I'm not sure you
guys might feel different about it but
anyway okay watch it ask greg suggests a
suggest me a a best air cooler for my
rise in five four three hundred is
hitting 50 degrees on idle check your
thermal paste and make sure your coolers
mounted properly because it shouldn't be
idling at 50 you probably have some
trash thermal paste or your fans are not
moving or something but there's no best
air cooler if you want like you want
like the most expensive air cooler
that'll be one of the best out there
what do you mean best you need to get
something that's in your price range I
would say hyper 212 Evo cryo rig h7 make
sure it's compatible with the aim for
saw get those are gonna be perfectly
fine anything with like a hundred and
fifty watt ish TDP or higher it's gonna
be perfectly fine for you okay couple
more questions we've been going at it
for about an hour so we did live stream
yesterday a live stream with Brian on
his channel first and on my channel
second so you can check out our
respective channels who want to get
caught up on the good stuff between
Brian and I Brian's a really cool dude
Alex David asked Greg opinions on the
nvidia gtx 1100 I know nothing about it
I know and I'm pretty sure you mean like
1180 or 1170 I don't know anything about
the GTX 11 series so you'll have to wait
until Nvidia says something and even if
I did know something about it I couldn't
tell you about it that's just how a lot
of this stuff works I wish I could tell
you but I don't know enough about it
lately to even give you some context
clues I don't do you know digging into
rumors and stuff Andrew law
why do CPUs with the same architecture
of different single core performance
that is because not all not all wafers
are manufactured with the same precision
there are always degrees of error and a
lot of them like what AMD does
especially if you look at any because
they have higher core count tears for
their consumer grade stuff but if you
know a particular you know if a
particular wafer has a few imperfections
then those eight quartz chips right or
what would be eight core chips end up
becoming six core chips or for courtship
because they disable some of those some
of those cores when they're not up to
spec when they don't meet a certain
standard that's literally binning and I
have a video talking about all that in a
dedicated what's a dedicated video
type in like CPU bidding science studio
there you go it'll answer everything for
you in that video with regards to that
question hopefully a couple more
questions here a couple more give some
good stuff give me some good stuff mr.
OG gamer I don't know anything about the
GTX 1170 so don't ask me about it I
can't even talk I couldn't talk about it
even if I knew anything about it because
it's it would be under NDA Mathew
Smalley sorry I got a no before we order
parts I feel like I read that out of
context yep certainly did I should Poli
read these beforehand I love seeing
Walter White in the chess is great you
guys know I filled Walter White PCs
Walter White Ruby pcs in the past you
guys what parts would you recommend if I
have a lot I mean a lot of money to blow
and I want to build a new meth lab I'm
not sure but I don't recommend building
a meth lab that is for a Safi legal
second off it's extremely unhealthy
especially be breathing any of those
very caustic and toxic fumes and third
off I mean oh I don't want to spoil it
but okay things at some points in the
series don't go too well for you Walter
so maybe you learned your lesson maybe
you do it the same all over again I
don't know but you know that's this was
a big decision and you ruin a lot of
things in the process so a lot of
important things in your life to think
about next time if you get that chance
if you do I see Jared Hilson said I was
saying fir mark was stable but pub G
crashed I don't even know what that's in
context do I know you asked a question
earlier about let me scroll down ha
scrolling down I don't see it nope I
don't see it if you get a game crashing
then it just it just means that you need
a fix your frequency of your voltage you
have some sort of instability there if
it's your CP you're referring to you I
don't you should have given more context
because I can't find your I can't find
your your comment and this slew of
questions I'm glad we have this little
question so thank you for all these
questions I'm trying to get through all
of them I've really tried here if you
look if you are copying and pasting the
same question over and over just to like
spam me so that I see it I will
purposefully not answer your question it
just doesn't do anybody else a service
it interferes with my ability to go
through questions and to give people
equal and proper treatment so don't spam
your questions I'm going to try to get
through as many as I can
and these live streams just you know no
one wants to see someone's family I'm
gonna put you in timeout I will I put
you in timeout nan you see it you see it
bashes r0s what are your thoughts on
crypto I hate crypto I think it's a just
cesspool of unregulated crap I've never
touched cryptocurrency I've never mind
cryptocurrency I never will
straight up I am Groot ask Greg would
you consider doing a 360 million paracin
video that it's kind of I mean in my
opinion they're kind of self-explanatory
they're all gonna cool about the same
unless they have the new upgraded pumps
most coolers most AOS are gonna use some
derivative of like an ace detect bump
which means they're gonna cool about the
same relative to the radiator size and
ultimately what the radiator does is
just allow you to run your fans at lower
rpm because you can displace more air
right through a wider surface area that
you when it comes to an AI oh just pick
the one you think looks the best you
know and and if you want a bigger AI oh
if you can afford a bigger rad with your
AI oh then then you should know that
you're probably gonna have a quieter
system again because you keep those fan
RPMs lower because you're displacing
more air per unit area so anyway yeah
Brian I don't like crypto that would
have been a good topic Brian I would
have been a good topic to discuss in our
last game we have to say that for next
week because yeah I'm just you know
crypto I don't have anything against
people who make money crypto mining you
know if you're gonna mine anything at
all just make sure that you go into it
expecting I feel like people go into it
expecting to make a ton of money and you
can certainly make money - it's
definitely profitable I mean Brian you
proved that I've watched your video
about you were talking about how much
money you made doing it and that's cool
but at the same time I just don't I
don't feel like it's a good idea to use
cards that I was sent for free to mine
with I I just I've never I don't know I
just feels a little weird to me I would
never want to go out and buy cards to
mine with so the fact that I could use
them for free it's just an advantage
that I had because I'm in a position to
get free stuff but I then at that point
I feel like it's yeah I still feel like
it's just a little too I don't I don't
know on top of that you know you could
lose all your money in a day crypto
if a currency crashes because people
inside trade and everything it's totally
unregulated it totally is and because of
that I I just you know to be honest to
like the US stock market let's be honest
there's a lot of corruption in that to
you but I feel like there's just so much
shady stuff that happens with crypto
trading that people don't know about
because it's totally unregulated and
there's no news coverage on it you know
the public news coverage because it's
such like a it's just a shady market and
I just don't see the value in it and
it's the same way that people do
CJ airsoft tips advice for a first-time
PC build yeah that the back plate the
rear i/o back plate that you know the
rear i/o shield that's a pain install
just make sure you install it properly
and make sure you don't forget to
install it cuz that's a pain install
once the motherboards already in there
it's and you're impossible
so yeah that's my that's my tip right
says okay I understand Greg doesn't like
money at all
chromosome to Greg is not you oh we are
definitely going to talk about
cryptocurrency in our next one that'll
be a really hot topic just because I
think I feel like we we we think so
differently when it comes to crypto
currencies it would be really nice to
finally disagree openly about something
in one of our live streams alright one
more question I need something good
folks give me one more riveting question
and and then we will call it a day you
know one more one more question folks I
need something good I need something
really juicy and of course these are
gonna be rolling in kind of delay it so
give me a second to find a good one but
I need some good questions so if you
have something you've been waiting to
ask I ask it right now and I will find
my best to pick a really good question
to end this live stream with so give me
the good stuff give me the good stuff oh
yeah I see it I see you coming in oh
yeah oh this was good stuff you guys
saying it yeah Matthew's like give it to
me Greg oh yeah let me see good stuff
it's a good stuff oh yes all right
hmm yeah this is good this is good this
is good I'll get to you super chat
that's a separate thing I'm gonna answer
one that's not super chat as well
oh yeah okay hmm mm-hmm
I see him it's good stuff looking good
hmm
okay okay okay looking good all right
here we go question I'm gonna answer ah
yeah this is this is a good one I think
it's you all right
Marco asks gtx 1070 or gtx 1070 TI the
jump between at ten seventy 1078 ain't
all it's cracked up to be it's not this
super crazy you know just ball or
upgrade that's gonna yield so many more
FPS right but the question that's worth
dressing is whether or not you should
choose the ten seventy TI over the ten
seventy and I think in the current
market there's definitely a place for
the ten seventy TI because there's more
in supply right now ten seven ET is the
ten seventy supply equalized with
respect to demand a long time ago back
when we were the middle of
cryptocurrency crap and we basically had
a much lower supply because prices were
not at the the equilibrium price point
that we would expect for a proper supply
and demand economy and I talked about
that specifically in another video that
you can look at later about why graphics
where prices are so high anyway I think
that you can find a really good prices
for 1070 TI's now because there are so
many of them in stock I can attest it
that firsthand I know this for a fact
and I know they're given like twenty or
thirty dollars steam keys to not steam
keys but like Steam you know money gift
cards that you can use in Steam games so
that pretty much narrows it down I think
about 400 450 bucks for a 1070 TI where
the 1070 if you can even find one's
gonna be priced about same so yeah I
think that 1070 TI right now is a good
buy maybe not six months from now but
right now it's doing pretty well and I'm
actually do a review on one very soon so
you guys you guys are just have that
fresh in your mind here bash their
thoughts on the infinity war not gonna
happen I'm not spoiling it come on
okay scrolling up I'm going to answer
the super checkbook like Zach would be
bulb rocks donate another $5 to the
super chat s340 elite 800 X 1080 X 370
16 gigs what's the next upgrade loop
case I don't know is a pretty good
system right now I would suggest storage
maybe you might want to consider store
it I'm sure you have an SSD in there if
you don't get one if you have an m2
you're already set and power supply I'm
sure you got a decent enough power
supply 600 watch so it would be
perfectly fine for that build and yeah I
think that's where we're gonna call it
thanks to those who who stopped by we
had 317 people watching I feel like it's
been stuck on 317 for a long time but
thank you to those who are I really
appreciate that if you are really upset
that I didn't answer your question don't
worry we do lose every Sunday night and
I believe with Brian from now we're
gonna do these every Saturday night as
well so you get double the after-hours
from me on my half every Saturday and
Sunday night the Saturday night streams
are gonna be a little earlier the Sunday
night streams which is what you're
watching right now start at 9:00 p.m.
ish CST that could be in the morning for
you wherever you live especially than
like Europe or Asia but for the States
that is around 9:00 10:00 p.m. if you're
on the west coast that is 8:00 p.m. PST
thanks you guys for watching and I will
catch you all next week bring your
questions and bring the love bring the
hate whatever you got but I thank you
guys for supporting me and for providing
me for providing these and content for
live stream because without your
questions I would just be sitting here
in front of the camera looking like a
total idiot alright guys I will catch
you in the next after hours again
remember 9 p.m. CST alright I'm out now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
