white version like eight probably close
to a dozen PC buildings channel that
have a white theme behind them
I used Walter White because I'm a big
fan of Breaking Bad I think that was one
the best series on television when he
came out and I was really pumped for the
final season they kind of delayed that
for a while
build the suspense I remember I was a
freshman in college I think when the
final season premiered so the last few
episodes I guess that was a really
exciting time and probably like the
highlight of my first year in college
and that sounds super nerdy but this is
my way of paying tribute to it right I
build themed pcs centered around Walter
White the blue sky like crystal meth
thing that he cooked that was his
specialty was a chemist in in high
school and again yeah there's some
backstory there so I try to pay tribute
to that you know one of my favorite
shows on television by building and this
is probably again like in all reality
maybe like the fourth or fifth version
of Walter White that I've actually put
on the channel the original one was
filmed right here check out this video
if you want to be cut up to speed
otherwise let's cut to some sweet b-roll
for this one I didn't show the build log
just because I like to know sometimes I
just like to be with myself without
having to move a camera around all the
time when I'm building one of these I
had a lot of fun building it but I think
you'll appreciate the looks of this one
at the end so that's what we're gonna
cut to right now
now I'm sure most we could figure out
the platform I chose just from the
b-roll and of course was an Intel
platform I what with the 8700 K more
specifically because I will be comparing
it to the 9900 K in a few different
videos coming up very soon we finally
have our end table representing us the
90 in 100 K so that'll be nice I'm
excited for that also I'm going to be
giving you a different perspective a
different sort of review on the 9900 K
we've already seen the plethora of
benchmark data from other text to wears
really late to the party understand that
that's why we're not gonna do our
typical run-through of tests I think
it's fairly obvious from just the the
raw performance numbers here that 900 K
is a little overpriced and what we're
going to take away from that is well it
might be overpriced in the sense that
we're squeaking out maybe a 5 to 10
percent difference in some tasks and
some games we're not even getting a 5%
fps Delta but do I notice the difference
in my everyday usage when I stream when
I game so if I can find a use a specific
use case scenario for the 9900 K if I
see difference between that and the 8700
K which I'm currently running in Walter
white version whatever then I will tell
you guys in a follow-up video but if I
don't see a difference if I'm you know
my game frame rates are pretty much the
same there's maybe a 5% again Delta or
so content creation rendering scrubbing
all that stuff seems pretty consistent
there's not much difference for the two
and then also when it comes to streaming
if I don't notice much of a difference
despite having the extra two cores and
four threads on board maybe we can
overclock a bit higher I'm not sure I'll
be able to present all that data to you
just kind of my first-person experience
here so if you're on the fence about
whether or not you want to buy into the
newer Intel refresh if you will then
hopefully that video will answer the
question for you without having to go
deep into the data and all the
benchmarks which I'm sure you've already
seen by the way if I want to build this
exact system or something very close to
it you can check out our affiliate links
down below they do give us again a small
kickback so it helps us out but
otherwise you just click those or you
can search for them yourself on Amazon
or Newegg buy similar parts I recommend
again if you're going for a white themed
build keep with a white case stick with
a white graphics card I did choose a
dark motherboard this is the Asus what
is this hero 10 yeah the Maximus Hero 10
or 10 hero whatever order they have that
and I chose that because I wanted some
contrast so I could have thrown
everything of the system and and had it
all be really white I did have a couple
white motherboards particularly from MSI
I could have used in this bill but I
wanted a black motherboard for contrast
because it makes that graphics card
really pop and that's what I really
wanted ultimately was to show off this
beautiful gigabyte r-tx 2070 the color
scheme is a little deceiving on camera
it looks more blue here but this is what
it looks like to the human eye I'm just
kind of you know changing the colors on
screen here but that looks a little more
neutral and that's what I was going for
I just wanted a generic LED strip to
light up the white components and then I
had some purple tones in the background
to kind of offset the the neutral white
color scheme so we have these bora fans
back here from leone these are purple we
do have the maximus 10 logo on the
motherboard set to purple as well as the
gigabyte logo on the graphics card and i
just chose purple because it's a it's a
great color to kind of contrast
the neutral white tones of the build
again so a good thing is I can change
this whatever I want if you want to
stick with like blue blue would make
more sense for like the crystal-meth
thing like the blue sky right his Walter
White's product was was blue just
because the way he made it the chemical
composition of the product so if I
wanted to stay more true to the Walter
white tones I can turn these colors back
to blue no but I was with purple just
because it looks blue on camera the rest
of the system so what the heck by the
way the case that I chose one of my
favorite cases of all time it's only
about a hundred and twenty ish US dollar
I think is great value for dual tempered
glass panels you get excellent airflow
tons of cable management at the rear
plenty of water cooling support there's
just so much space in this case because
of the way it's designed I really love
the layout it's the PC 11 dynamic from
leanly it is also linked down below if
you guys have any like sort of custom
loop you're using an ATX motherboard and
let's say you have two radiators to 360
mo rads you have a big reservoir to
graphics cards you can fit all of that
in this case I really like it because
it's very versatile and again it is
affordable considering what you're
getting in the package by the way full
disclosure this video wasn't sponsored
really by anybody we're not receiving
any money for this build I know some
tech tubers will do product placements
and stuff and some of them don't tell
you that their product placements we're
going to do our best going forward to
disclose all of that again we want to be
as transparent as possible
so we did have gigabytes send the r-tx
2070 for this particular build that was
sent to us for this and then pretty much
everything else I've just had laying
around for a few weeks or months either
that or it was being used and another
build and I just ripped out of that and
put it into this one we do a lot of
recycling around here and that's kind of
what goes on behind the scenes I've been
moving some stuff around by the way so
if you're wondering why things look a
little different it's because I'm trying
to try to fit everything the way that I
want it just kind of bothered me the way
that I had it in here right after we
moved into this place I think now we're
a little better setup for live streams
by the way live streams every Sunday
night that's Sunday night CST 9 p.m.
Central Standard Time
we have After Hours live streams you
guys ask questions I give answers as
long as I know how to answer them if not
I just jot down a note or two and I go
back and research I'll get back with you
again another dedicated video or in the
next live stream to answer that question
is a good way for me to learn good way
for you guys to learn and for us to
interact on a more personal level so
again live streams every Sunday night
9:00 p.m. CST they're called after hours
so that's it for this one just wanted to
show off another build I'm pretty proud
of this one I think it's one of my
cleaner builds big thanks to Tony Sharpe
from everybody PC customs Tony hooked us
up with these cables we've been reusing
them actually for the past four or five
builds but I love them a lot and that's
why I decided to throw those into this
rig and thanks to gigabyte for sending
their r-tx 2074 just being the icing on
the cake here I think this is one of the
sexiest r-tx cards on the market and
it's not one of the most expensive
either which is a good thing so if
you're looking for a lower tier r-tx
carb which is still gonna be around a
GTX 1080 in terms of performance then
you check out the Arctic's 27 a link
below it's a gigabyte white model if you
want a white r-tx card this is pretty
much the only one you can buy at this
point but I think it's one of the best
looking cards ultimately anyway so it's
not going to matter let me know in the
comments section down below what you
guys think about this build I expect you
guys to leave a thumbs up if you thought
the video was cool dislike the video if
you feel the coupe adopts it or if you
hate everything about life that red
subscribe button down there by the way
is to subscribe in case you were
wondering I expect you guys to do that
if you haven't already please do that
we're so close to 400 K and that is an
awesome milestone to say we have a four
two thousand subscriber YouTube channel
not as cool as 500,000 but whatever I'll
take it we're pretty close and again for
those who've been sticking around since
the very beginning you guys are awesome
and I see the same kinds of people
commenting after every video is posted I
really appreciate you guys especially
because you're there upfront and you're
willing to engage and you're willing to
watch the video and when it comes out it
just shows that you guys care and that's
enough for me to keep going so please
keep doing what you're doing and that
will allow me to continue doing what I
am doing I love this job I love you guys
I will catch you in the next one this is
science studio thanks for building with
us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
