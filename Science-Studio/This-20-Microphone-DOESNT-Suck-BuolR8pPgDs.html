now costs about 20 bucks on Amazon and
in today's video we're gonna figure out
whether or not it actually sounds like a
$20 microphone although I'm sure you've
probably already made up your mind so to
cut straight to the point
this microphone punches well above its
weight class one of the many reasons why
we bought it by the way I'm going to
switch in between this scene in here and
outside near a highway actually very
close to a highway where it's very loud
many cars passing every minute just
seeing it a feel for how it sounds
indoors as well as outdoors by the way
I'm a pretty cheap person by nature I
think Lisa will attest to that and the
20 large Tiger really enticed me so that
was one of the reasons why I bought it I
figured worst case it would be trash and
I throw it away but honestly it's not
bad at all let's start first with
construction and features and then we'll
dive into the sound test although this
entire video is basically one big sound
test in the box which was really nothing
special you'll find the microphone a
foam mutter an XLR to three-and-a-half
millimeter cable a cold shoe mount and a
three and half millimeter two quarter
inch adapter it's really all you'll need
for a setup like this the stock cable I
should connect this microphone directly
to most cameras with microphone jacks
which is what we're doing right now with
our Sony as7 2 and the adapter is good
for sound boards and other audio
interfaces with balanced outs and
another thing in the fact that this
microphone sports an XLR interface by
default is a nice touch of this price
point a battery is required if you
intend on using the stock cable of
course but I had no issues at all
running this microphone directly as a
pass-through with phantom power supplied
from my soundboard this is actually
contrary to what the seller on Amazon
States in response to a question
regarding this format just wanted to
clear this up
I do have first-person experience with
this so it's certainly versatile and can
be used in a numerous ways so I'm
actually impressed thus far now the
included XLR cable is very long I'm
estimating about 20 feet or so I'm gonna
cut to the outside clip right now
singing an idea just how far away that
actually is so this is about how far you
can get from the camera yeah there you
get an idea of how far you can move back
from cameraman okay
a woman in this case anyway on two more
things in this video in a nutshell the
subject should have plenty of room to
breathe respect to the camera position
build quality by the way is excellent as
well there is absolutely no plastic
anywhere along the exterior of the
microphone save the toggle we'll discuss
shortly it stretches to just under 28
centimeters without a cable connected
meaning it has the capacity to reach the
subject while remaining mostly out of
frame the microphone is largely
unbranded save the words unidirectional
electret condenser microphone which
denote the style of Mike this is
unidirectional mics tend to exhibit a
very hyper cardioid pickup pattern
meaning the condenser is especially
biased toward one can one direction in
this case it's actually above the
microphone meaning it's especially
sensitive to those sounds it picks up
from that direction this is perfect for
say single speakers and casual
interviews where the host can hold the
microphone directly below his or her
face unidirectional mics tend to exhibit
a cardioid pickup pattern which is why
we're out here I wanted to test that
aspect of it to see how noise cancelling
and is or how directional directionally
biased the diaphragm is so right now
standing next to a pretty major highway
here in the city and it's fairly loud
it's difficult to hear myself talk I'm
gonna have to figure out what it sounds
like in post and see if it is even
usable audio I have no idea for all I
know this could be just like the worst
recording ever with our Sony a7 - we
found that an audio recording level of 3
was ideal for this setup it's what I'm
using right now and that's actually one
negative aspect of this mic I'd like to
address it Mike really has no volume
toggle of any sort meaning you'll have
to rely on your sound board or camera
for any audio maintenance make sure
you've calibrated this accordingly
before attending any like major event
for example this would be a pain to fix
in post and if you're peaking in any of
your footage you might as well refilm
the entire scene because the audio is
gonna be trash now in terms of tolerance
microphone actually becomes increasingly
sensitive at a rate of roughly 6
decibels per foot so if you hold this
extremely close to your mouth which I
did a few times outside it's not gonna
sound so great I found that the optimal
speaking distance it's stock was about 6
inches but this since the microphone is
sensitive by default right any slight
gesture closer toward your mouth can
giraffe
Stickley alter amplitude it's just that
sensitive and that could create problems
rated later on now as such holding the
mic slightly further away and boosting
everything in post was the easiest for
us to manage especially in loud
environments also be sure that the mic
is held firmly when filming you don't
want to knock it around because all that
will be picked up when you record this
is pretty typical of cheaper microphones
nothing to be worried about by the way
the mutter or the windscreen whatever
you want to call this foam cover
actually does come in handy we tested it
outside several times like we are now
it's actually kind of windy I can't
really tell with my hair but Lisa's hair
is kind of what do you say waving in the
wind so yeah it's not dead silent out
here the wind is it's picking up so this
is when this would come in handy
now let's discuss audio quality in a
nutshell it's pretty darn good I mean
for 20 bucks anyway it's not gonna be a
shure or a Behringer but it gets the job
done and for a heck of a lot cheaper
than the former especially I'm gonna let
you listen to some sound test here
without any tweaking in post save maybe
a bump in volume I kind of kind of
normalized the tones but other than that
I'm not going to change anything else so
you guys get a feel for what this mic
sounds like in the real world
so I guess test number two you're
sitting by a pool and it happens to have
fountains and for some reason you see
this is a fit space for an interview I
guess this is that test so there's
actually quite they going onto the
background that water is extremely loud
despite us being roughly 15 20 feet away
from it I don't know what the heck I'm
doing on a poolside in like the middle
of winter but yeah
here's that test can you hear the water
now can you hear the water we'll find
out
you can hear that I'm back to my to my
face opening a gate this gives Lisa a
great time to practice her camera skills
is that camera staying focused the whole
time we have it on auto focus I'm sorry
sorry what was sometimes it loses the
focus and it's about to get very echoey
so in a situation where you don't have
the best acoustics for video basically
this garage this is what it would sound
like using this $20 microphone now I
don't expect this mic is gonna be great
at getting rid of especially River
that's just something that most mics are
gonna be victims of even thousand dollar
mics so it really comes down to how well
you insulate your room and dampen the
walls but yeah I guess again we'll find
out in post you guys can just let me
know what you think in the comments all
right and for the last test I'm standing
right next to the TV we have Judge Judy
on in judge Judy's she's she could be a
loud woman at times I don't think she'll
deny that I have the volume set to about
the same volume as what you would expect
from a normal human voice speaking about
six or so feet away so we're testing
basically the isolation properties of
the mic with respect to other people
other sounds that are human sounds
hopefully you have an idea of the kinds
of tolerances as mike has and different
environments so I've got to say very
impressed with this $20.00 setup it's so
good in fact for the money that I'm
perfectly comfortable using this for our
CES 2019 coverage I do want to bring up
an alternative to using a kind of
shotgun and I guess handheld mic that is
wired directly into the camera this
right here is the rode mic Pro Plus and
this is pretty much the best shotgun you
know top camera mounted rode mic you can
buy for about two to three hundred
dollars it's got quite a number of
settings at the back and it is something
I'd used kind of on and off when I was
out of the studio but honestly I would
much rather hold a mic much closer to my
face I just sounds a lot clearer the
problem with these of courses that are
mounted to the camera so you have to get
super close to the camera for this thing
to actually do its job very well it does
an ok job canceling out
background noise and even noise from the
side to an extent but I really like the
hyper-cardioid effect of the $20 mic I'm
calling it the $20 mic cuz it really has
no name which is another reason why I'm
so surprised there's no brand behind
this I mean they literally just call it
a generic handheld microphone on Amazon
so more power to it to be honest I've
been using Wireless set up specifically
for like CES and copy techs for quite a
while and I'm just tired of dealing with
interference from other setups I mean
there's so many people around you using
the same or basically on the same
frequencies the constant cutting in and
out during filming they need to replace
battery so many times and recharge the
packs I haven't really tested battery
life on this thing yet I haven't had it
for a long enough to really know but the
website does say that one double-a
battery will get you 26 hours worth of
recording time so like it becomes
anywhere close to 26 hours in the real
world I'll be satisfied my only
complaints or the in regards to the the
volume toggle we don't have that that
means the diaphragm is just inherently
sensitive the fact that there was no
battery included in the box probably a
bit picky but I mean some people don't
have random double A batteries laying
around and also there's no light
indicating whether or not the battery is
running low on charge so if using uh I
don't know using this for a full day or
two full days you might be wondering at
what point the mics gonna die what point
the battery is gonna go dead and you're
not really gonna know you're just gonna
have to keep watching the camera and
kind of guess roughly when that patter
is gonna need replacing or have some
tester on hand so you can swap it out
and check so yeah maybe the lack of a
light the fact that you can't toggle
volume on the mic itself and the fact
that no batteries included that's really
that's really all I can pick this at I
mean I feel like a 20 bucks so even
those critiques are unfair because I
mean 20 bucks like that's that's not
cheap right it's not expensive scuse me
at all for this microphone but maybe
you're just wondering how good it is and
you want to know all the pros and cons
there they are
honestly I'm perfectly comfortable
taking this with me to CES I'm using it
again using this a whole video in this
scene here and also outside I am just so
blown away by how great this sounds I
kind of wish I'd known about this mic a
lot sooner now for more on this
particular unit I invite you guys to
tune in to our CES coverage starting the
second week of January that's coming up
very soon
I've affiliate lengthe SIG's
act model its exact microphone down
below for your viewing pleasure
I appreciate the support let me know
what you're currently sporting and your
camera setup if you have one and if this
is something you'd consider on a tight
budget you guys like this video a thumbs
up you know what to do thumbs down for
the opposite or if you hate everything
