sending us to Computex 2017 what's up
everyone we are here at the Thermaltake
booth Computex 2017 mike is an awesome
guy just met him but he's very
enthusiastic with what he has to show
for a point 17 when I got Mike a Greg I
really appreciate you guys first coming
out here he's really busy here like that
we appreciate it
we got our news this is 20 this is our
level 20 chassis it's all aluminum
chassis five millimeter thick aluminum
five millimeter takes tempered glass
Noah this is the chamber design so
there's three separate chambers all the
tempered glass is the push of a button
on a nice swivel open door offering the
vertical GPU mount offering liquid
cooled pass-through capabilities and of
course the side radiator mount which is
kinda neat we got the idea from the core
speed theory to kind of show off the fan
to give a different look to give the
same amount of cooling I've got to say
this is a beautiful piece of furniture I
know we talked about this this is lovely
I think excellent yeah we're really
excited for this is going to be for our
upcoming 20th anniversary so it's not
out yet she's just the concept design we
want the feedback guys you know we want
to get that feedback see what we can do
what we can improve on it means that you
know there's no mistakes only learn in
college I thought all right let's move
on to us something else cool view 91
here is definitely you know it's modeled
off our W 100 offers a nice high Miller
a tempered glass or is like butter as
the way it open real thick tempered
glass definitely takes away the issue of
you know trying to take the panel on and
off and if you some other people do a
different lab solution we've upgraded
this offering the vertical do you
mountain hair dual loop for days I mean
you have fun just amazing here to do a
lots and lots of stuff and that's what
we want to bring with the top family now
moving over here this is my personal
favorite for the show this is our view
71 TG this is a completely new design
from thermaltake offering four five
millimeter tempered glass panels they're
on a suicide door hinge so you hot rod
guys out there this is definitely
something that I'm a real personal
favorite of you got that vertical GPU
mount in here
and one of the new features is the side
radiator mount so you can actually mount
the radiator side way or in the front or
in the top giving great versatility
up to a three hundred and sixty
millimeter radiator that's awesome so
yeah really cool really excited about
this
I think builders especially will take a
lot of respect to the work that we did
as far as how to do so especially with
like the top radiator may I have it's in
the video so we take this off right
there in an office off this has got a
bracket in here that can then just be
removable you can stole that radiator
your fans get it all set up and then
just clip a whole all outside of the
cage and just drop it in so much easier
I can attest to that and I mean even
with this I mean as you kind of hold it
it's sturdy oh yeah cheap and everything
this is coming in at 169 99 MSRP and the
glass on top dude yeah the nice tempered
glass on top oh man I mean with this how
you have this I mean it's it's not
something you got to like worry about it
means just boom boom right in great case
here 71 fused by thermal take everybody
seen the view 31 yeah you know it's
great case definitely a good starting
point for us to expand on our view
series right I'll bring the dual
tempered glass
you got the vertical GPU mount here with
a nice price point and a nice mid-range
mid tower chassis to give people some
more on there then over here for new for
the show we have our few 21 TG and our
chord G 21 kg basically the same case
coming in at $69.99 MSRP Wow
your difference is going to be that core
look or the view look either have more
ventilation or get that nice sleek look
at the view series now four millimeter
dual tempered glass panels on both sides
and it's a great price great little
entry to kind of include income feel
branch out or if you serious what so
$69.99 for this right here to ever glass
left side panel and front panel here
yeah well the front panel is actually
really oh it's another conference
laughing okay but we do have this it's a
four millimeter thick versus a five
millimeter thick right right away we can
give a better prime enterprise oh yes
that's the next one price point so here
we have our core p7 and rejected out
with some RGB video we've got some new
product that we've added in here we have
an RGB
radiator that has a nice wide RGB strip
on the side we got our PR 22 RGB pump
and reservoir combo
we've updated our w-4 - the w-4 plus so
now offers at 12 independent LEDs we
have our IR GB power supply and we have
on the top there which might be kind of
hard to see is our IR TV booming strip
now the best part about all these
components here is it's all synced into
one software so being able to have
everything linked up it's all doing the
same mode right now it's in a sound mode
for example reacting to the down that
I'm playing I can easily come over here
and change the mode because these are
all set on the same profile right once
everything's kind of on the same profile
it's very easy to change like if I go to
like a ripple and let's say we speed
this up here I'll have this once I click
Save you'll just see everything oh allah
and everything syncs up and it really is
I think going to give a great look for
people that are looking for not just the
rainbow unicorn stuff but being able to
get certain colors like a monochromatic
with 12 LEDs that you can do basically
anything that you want and then you have
a variety of animation and stuff that we
can all link everything up doing a great
presentation well you've got three
separate loops in this whole thing yeah
and then okay so then with the p7 this
is I think one of the first if not the
first triple loop certified cake I mean
you have three radiator mounts you have
three pump mounts here as well so as you
can see we decked it out with three
separate colors isolating the cooling
even more or just to give that cool look
you know something you want the biggest
in the baddest this is our PWM so you've
got cases it looks like furniture and
you've got cases it look like entire
walls well this can be mounted on the
wall to Ptolemy's get some good screws
you seen all the water blocks on so we
have our new flow ai yo I got some
samples of it over there you can guys
get some pictures of this but this is
now coming so was it having five port
and you got three connections guess what
that gives you two free spots alright so
now that we've integrated a lot of our
other stuff like or Lumi strip and our
other products in there - it's a great
little accessory to add on or like you
know you wanna get that fan in the back
- yeah link it all up and guess what
it's all synced together that's Estevan
so this is real we're really excited for
this this should be available in about
one to two months so this is our core
the
p1 and video d4 GG extradition so I'm a
big fan of green I'm a die-hard NVIDIA
car so I don't know and I'm really
excited for this we've done something
similar but not to this scale
now we've offered that tempered glass
panels on both sides we got the cool
little graphic that's actually built
into the glass green and black hard
drive trays even the filter here up on
top got a neat little pattern to kind of
just give it a little bit more that
g-force edge to it right now you got the
cool logo badge here in the front and
then on the other side if you want to
come right over here we've added some
really cool artwork to the side of the
Kemper glass to kind of hide a little
bit of the cable management but still
get that tempered glass look and just
give something to me right yeah this
will be a limited edition case that
we'll be having for the us here purchase
yeah chicken stop you know it so you
know we've done the gaming chair and
we've you know already established our
gaming chair series line and everything
you know we're a we're a cooling company
so we want to have a cool chair so we
came out with the new gaming chair
that's got a built-in fit right you mean
it literally cools it it's actually
literally cooled used so in those long
game sessions man you're definitely want
to avoid that si so I'm not going to say
it but you know if you don't want to
have that rolls in there so this is
going to definitely extend the life for
people that you know might be in a
little bit of a border region or if
you're just an extra sweaty guy this
might be an awesome product
I'm since I want to sit down all right
all right we gotta check it out man
we're going to do this you can't it you
can feel it
oh yeah oh much yeah it's not a little
bit you know it's pretty good I don't
know how to describe it but it actually
is pretty soothing kind of it's tricky
but it's awesome but leave it the
thermal take the put a fan in his chair
this is our new shock pro RGB headset
your cups are like marshmallow them look
like they're really really soft it's got
a nice little RGB lighting at that
lighting thing because you like to look
at yourself in the mirror when you game
right but for me it's all about the
adjustable headrest and ear couple here
for a turn on at home yeah oh oh do it
I'm not saying this because I'm next to
Mike for the best feeling headset ever
I'm really impressed that this feels
great
I can't even it doesn't feel like I have
it on yeah because that's the other
thing too is like we know I'm gaming for
a long period of time you kind of get
that squished head yeah yeah everything
it's like - with the aluminum braids you
know it sucks you bulky so the weights
really not there to give you that
comfort issue yeah I knew it like you
put some older headsets on your ears
start getting some you know they just
start getting sore it's like they're
just sitting there but over time that
pressure just builds I don't really
you'll realize it until you take it off
your volumes oh yeah here's our
breathing now yeah no this is oh yeah
it's really nice really looking forward
to that Hawk this feels great
so I would say that's pretty much it for
like my big stuff and everything we got
some other little products are going to
be coming out too we're coming out with
like a ring plus like a budget confront
oh yeah we're at like a software but
just like an analog controller yeah
first one okay so with the ring plus and
some other product that we're going to
be having coming out as well as give you
really really cool okay so yeah stay
tuned for that no getting all the
ministry ball heck yes I can't resist
this is giving someone launch specific
and we definitely appreciate your
support and you know time to come out

you having us it said I know you guys
have just been growing at a bunch of
tech bunch of cool tech but we
appreciate you watching appreciate Mike
