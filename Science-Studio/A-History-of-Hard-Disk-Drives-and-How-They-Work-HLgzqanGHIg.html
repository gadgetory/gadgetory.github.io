it's not a boring video what better way
to kick things off than to mention the
very first hard disk drive ever invented
the IBM 305 so we thought about creating
a new kind of electronic machine to keep
business accounts up to date and make
them available not monthly nor even
daily but immediately such a machine
would for the first time provide
management with perpetually current
business records the 305 used magnetism
to embed data onto a platter or physical
magnetized discs that held the
information the cabinet that contained
the drive measured approximately 150 by
170 by 75 centimeters or roughly the
size of to stand-up refrigerators inside
were 50 discs each measuring 61
centimeters in diameter that's fun at
1200 rpm for reference today's general
hard drives typically rotate 7,200 times
per minute or 120 times per second total
storage of the 305 was 5 million
characters equivalent to exactly 5
million bytes or using the decimal
system 5 megabytes to put that into
perspective that's about the size of a
single high-resolution photograph
perhaps the next noteworthy hard drive
leaf was IBM's 33:30 also known as
Merlin this storage facility contained
disk packs with whopping 200 megabyte
capacities and up to 1.2 gigabytes per
facility numberland also introduced
quote unquote error coding correction
which among other things prevented the
manifestation of disk errors as a result
of physical imperfections on the
platters these advancements pave the way
for larger drive capacities and cheaper
consumer grade units in 1980 IBM's 3380
became the first hard drive to ever
reach the 1 gigabyte milestone the 3380
contained two 1.26 gigabyte drives that
were sandwiched inside of a refrigerator
sized container in the same year the
world's first five and a quarter inch
hard disk drive the size of a standard
optical drive today was released and
named the st dash 506 and given a price
tag of 1500 US dollars which with
inflation taken into consideration is
roughly 4350 u.s. dollars today or 3,900
euros or 3,000 British pounds you could
build an immaculate PC with that some of
and I should also note that the STD 506
only contained a whopping five megabytes
of internal storage
it wasn't until 1997 that the first
three-and-a-half inch hard drive emerged
a unit IBM dubbed the Titan a single
Death Star Titan drive had a capacity of
sixteen point eight gigabytes and was
the first drive to introduce GMR or
giant magnetic resistance this discovery
and thus implementation requires a bit
of background knowledge on the hard
drive functionality in general but I'll
save that for another video now I'll go
ahead give it a shot
hard disk drives essentially using
magnetic field to create domains where
all magnetization is oriented in a
particular direction the direction in
which each domain is oriented for
example North versus South is indicative
of a logical level either 0 or 1 and if
you're familiar at all with computer
science 0 and 1 are the basis of binary
code which nearly all information
systems are reliant on today a series of
ones and zeros can represent any given
set of data and giant magnet resistance
allows for specific magnetic sensors to
more accurately detect the boundaries
between two anti parallel domains yeah
believe me I had to do quite a bit of
homework on that one I've attached links
in this video's description which detail
the inner workings of hard drives and
the theory behind GMR in much more
detail so no worries there but let's get
back to our timeline in 2003 SATA or
serial advanced technology attachment is
first introduced and would soon become
the prominent data transfer interface
ultimately replacing IDE or parallel ata
the presence of which was made known by
ribbon cables connecting motherboards to
drives in older pcs in the same year IBM
the computer giant of the 1900s sold its
disk drive division to a company called
Hitachi that you may be familiar with
in 2005 Hitachi went on to produce the
world's first 500 gigabyte hard drive
dubbed the GST a lineup which would
persist for quite some time the
following year a company called Seagate
you may have heard of one up Hitachi
with the world's first 750 K hard drive
and in this same year Toshiba released
the world's first 200 gigabyte 2.5 inch
hard disk drive and it's important to
point out the two and a half inch drive
is the most common form factor we see in
laptops today this Toshiba Drive also
took advantage of perpendicular
recording which allowed specific
magnetic arrangements to be packed in a
much smaller spaces meaning that
platters of similar densities could now
pack more information into the same
equivalent space ok here we go the hard
drive storage space war is on in 2007
the first 1 terabyte hard drive was
produced by Hitachi in 2009 a company by
the name of Western Digital who also
likely familiar invented the first two
terabyte hard drive in 2011 Seagate
invents the world's first four terabyte
hard drive and in 2014 Seagate began
selling the world's first eight terabyte
hard drives which you can still purchase
to this day and I'm quite certain that
the storage war will only continue to
intensify as time progresses
was developed by IBM after a search that
lasted five years a search that is not
ended nor will it be so long as men need
ever more powerful machines to extend
the farthest reaches of the human mind
let me know if you appreciate this first
installment of the history series here
on the channel by giving the video a
thumbs up give it a thumbs down if you
just hate everything about life be sure
to check out the links in the video
description to help explain in more
detail what I was actually talking about

you haven't already and suggest future
video topics in the comments as well
