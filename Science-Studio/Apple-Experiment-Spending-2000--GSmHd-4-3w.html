two Apple products I've never done this
before I've never owned any kind of
MacBook any Apple computer before so
that'll be interesting and yeah it's
gonna be a bit expensive but maybe after
the 30 days I'll find it it'll be worth
that money I highly doubt that I have my
reservations I've been an Android slash
Microsoft guy for a long time making
this which I'm sure will not be easy but
uh least I get products that look good
right
okay just purchased these three things
we'll go through it soon but yeah that
was a pretty penny I will say okay so I
came out spending a bit more than I
thought I was going to spend going in
I guess that's consequence of going in
store but I have the goodies but once
again more than I thought I would buy so
I have the MacBook it's the m3 processor
it's the newest addition the 2016
Edition I bought an Apple sport watch in
the space gray color or whatever there
that equivalent is because it's not
exactly space grey and then I also
bought an iPhone se so that's the
basically the 6s internals but with the
smaller form factor mainly because it
was cheaper and I didn't want to spend
more than 2 grand speaking of which I
almost spent that I spent about $2,000
on all of that so and I also bought one
of these which is a USB type-c 2 USB 3.1
thumb drive which I definitely need
considering the MacBook only comes with
one I guess external port and that's a
USB type-c port so yeah I'm already
starting to feel the buyer's remorse set
in just a little bit I don't know I
guess I guess I'll be able to assess how
I truly feel about these things once I
open them all up and start playing
around with them so I guess that's the
next part of the video let's go and do
that okay so after well a few hours of
getting everything situated East have an
Apple account with my iPhone 5s that I
had before I produced my note 4 so I
synced all that up now when I get an
iMessage notification or any any message
notification for that matter it all goes
to here as well and it goes to my new
Apple watch so yeah these were the
theory things that I purchased they're
all synced up I wanted to get all that
set up before I started filming so it
looked like I kind of knew what I was
doing now but there are a few things
that I do notice right off the bat that
I do absolutely love about this thing
and that's what I want to share with you
guys in this first little vlog e style
video here so first off right away yes
everyone for the most part knows this
we're looking at a USB type-c port here
on the left and that's it so first off
this thing has a USB type-c port on one
side obviously and then the other side
right here boom USB 3.1 so yeah 32 gigs
of it's only like 17 bucks so it's
better than nothing
and this will allow me to transfer files
from my desktop to to my macbook which
is great so that this is kind of a
must-have this is like the bare minimum
I would recommend there are like Docs
you can plug in here that kind of just
add expandable storage ports here USB
3.0 HDMI evens things like that that you
can add here on the left side because
that is it folks that's all you get is
that one tiny little port over there in
the corner and not too many things at
least currently are using that so that's
something you have to consider when you
purchase something like this the other
side obviously nothing but a single
headphone jack this is already really
weird I'm just I'm not used to this like
the whole operating system is just so so
different I I don't I've never owned a
MacBook I've never used OS X for longer
than like an hour and so yeah I'm having
to learn how to navigate how to do
everything now this I am familiar with I
am familiar with my iPhones I've used
iPhones in the past now this is the se
so we're looking at iPhone 6s specs so
the a9 chip all the goodies 64-bit
architecture of course but in the iPhone
5s form factor which I actually like I
like the smaller kind of more compact
phones much different than my Galaxy
Note 4 just somewhere somewhere behind
me and again like I've got the matching
spacecraft space grey and at the same
time the app watches it's almost a
matching color it's slightly darker than
the than the actual one that's actually
in the light it actually is a little
lighter so yeah I kind of get all three
match in here Space Gray that's my
favorite color Space Gray and the these
MacBooks and iPhones and all that good
stuff so yeah I like the color
coordination looks like I kind of what
I'm doing so first off I want to address
how beautiful this screen is it is
absolutely gorgeous I'm in love with
Retina displays I love the IPS
technology in like insane viewing angles
I mean there's like no look at that you
know you're not getting into that weird
color Distortion you know the lights
turn to darks and all that good stuff so
that's the lovely thing about inter
plane switching screen technology on top
of that you get great brightness so
right now we have it maxed out you see
which
down to half brightness here it's still
definitely doable I used to use this all
the time this is a membrane keyboard so
it has a kind of a kind of a mushy
feeling to it but it is very responsive
there is plenty of key travel so you
know when you're engaging the key anyway
that's that's something that's important
for me and over here we have a
mechanical keyboard sums from Aki my
review of this keyboard is right right
there but this is a mechanical keyboard
these riches and they feel completely
different than the other two that I just
showed you so I have three different
keyboard experiences here and I can say
without a shadow of a doubt that this is
the greatest feeling of all three I mean
really the only difference is the key
travel obviously you're not going to
have very much key travel at all on
these very thin laptops so I think these
butterfly switches here so it's kind of
a like a picture cross pattern when you
push the top of the key they kind of
just fold in like that that's
essentially what's going on inside each
of these key switches so I am still
trying to figure out this whole
operating system deal I know that this
down here is where I can find pretty
much everything so that's good I kind of
can relate this to the windows
experience it's really weird having to
go to the top-left to exit and maximize
windows and whatnot not the top right
like I'm used to on Windows but I mean
I'm willing to make some compromises for
the sake of well extreme portability for
one this laptop is super portable super
slim 12-inch screen I mean really this
laptop is so thin when I do it like when
I move it to here the camera thinks I'm
trying to trying to focus on stuff
behind it I can't even get it to be
detected by the center autofocus here
but this laptop is very very thin
something I was looking for in a laptop
I was tied between this and a Dell XPS
13 I know a lot of people who use
Microsoft your Louisville windows would
have told me that an XPS 13 would've
been a better choice but this is this is
something different I wanted to change
things up that's why I purchased this I
don't have buyer's remorse not like I
thought I would after spending worth
like $2,000 and all three of these
things I just really like how they're
all coordinated so this is literally
almost tied to this in every way and
then my my watch is tied to my phone via
bluetooth so really everything is
just-just coordinated so beautifully and
that's that's the perk of going with one
company one manufacturer for all of your
devices okay so one thing I'm noticing
is that geek wench for takes a lot
longer than Geekbench three days to
finish and I say that because well I
don't really know how long this should
take but on my editing rig we're looking
at 2 minutes and 20 seconds is going to
be around 2 minutes and 30 35 seconds by
the time this finishes so that's
considerably longer than my geek bench 3
required to finish its test around maybe
50 55 seconds with a core i7 6700 K so I
here we go I guess we're getting some
live results here single core ok these
are definitely different scores than
then what Geekbench 3 is pushing out so
23:46 and 4663 obviously nowhere close
to what the i7 pushing out but I will
say this for a laptop that's using a
core m3 which is only a dual core hyper
threaded like point 9 gigahertz CPU
that's really it's really not too shabby
I do have something that will actually
allow me to edit video clips that's
gonna be a lot better experienced than
my one over 100 s was now but most of my
editing again will remain on my custom
PC here so yeah you're seeing kind of a
comparison here obviously the single
core of this chip is better than the the
actual multi-core score of the m3 here
on the MacBook 2016 but like what can I
say so we ought to see how I have been
able to handle blackest applications
with the MacBook I am an engineering
major so we're you know I'm in the core
of my of my degree right now on the
senior so I'm taking a lot of classes
that require heavy programs we'll see if
this thing can can handle a that if I
have to do it all on my desktop and
obviously I fluent really don't really
expect too many problems with that this
is sporting the 12 megapixel camera and
that's yeah the a9 chip oh I don't
really care much more about than that
and then the Apple watch that's just
something that I kind of just picked up
on the spot I said well I'm going Apple
here and here so I might as well just
get the full package I will say one
thing the MacBook speakers in here
are absolutely crystal clear I I did not
I didn't I really didn't expect to have
such good speakers in such a slim device
so that's another plus for this there's
just other things that I keep
discovering about these devices that
that I really really enjoy that I guess
taking away from that buyer's remorse
that I otherwise would have experienced
speaking of which if you think that I
should experience buyer's remorse be
sure to let me know in comments below
obviously make a lot of hate for this
because I've been switch entirely from
Windows to this and from Android as well
to Apple OS X and iOS just let me know
what you think about the transition be
sure to stay tuned for the other vlogs
be posting multiple blogs with the
course of the next 30 days and then
we'll have the final verdict 30 days
from now and I guess I'll make up my
mind whether or not I'm going to keep
these or just sell them off not gonna be
returning these products so it's all
spent it's going to be spent I'm not
returning them so this is just a might
are going to eat the cost or I'm going
to enjoy the products I've been with
their day period but anyway folks be
sure to give this video a like if you
thought it was cool give a dislike if
you feel complete opposite or if you
hate everything about life be sure to
click the subscribe but if you have
already stay tuned for well more of
these vlogs and some more tech related
stuff I have a good one regarding CPUs
coming up tomorrow
this is science studio thanks for
learning with us and bearing with me</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
