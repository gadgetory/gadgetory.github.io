watts for $19.99 on new egg in fact it's
still that price right now as are the
recording date of this video so check it
out if you're interested in learning
more about it to find it from a company
called Zalman who I'm sure uses some
other company to actually manufacture
then they just rebrand it take their
sticker on there and say yes the Salomon
power supplies would most actually do
but I do not recommend you buy this
particular power supply there are
several reasons why but we're going to
do something very unique in this video
I'm going to throw this power supply
into the twenty five hundred dollar PC
behind me just to see what would happen
so this is the box right here I haven't
actually opened it yet had to look on my
new I ordered history to remind myself
what the name of the power supply
actually was my trusty box opener here
the I 373 50 K never fails next one box
opener the switching power supplies vm
600 - le2 year warranty dual graphics
card support and whatever that is I do
not believe nope no 80 plus
certification at all alright
internet thing open and okay so we get a
power cable that's nice and power supply
and for psu sirs you know that these are
just not premium at all when they come
in silver which usually matches nothing
in your PC build safe to keep things
together then bubble wrap I mean it's
not bad like now it's a typical cheap
power supply but this one isn't rated
for jack squat I'm a worried that it's
going to end up taking another component
in my expensive custom loop over there
with it so tread lightly alright so
we've got a standard 24 pin we have a
let's see SATA - molex power connectors
this one here is the 8 pin EPS cable for
your CPU this one has its the molex
molex I'm sorry SATA SATA and then one
molex alright now this is interesting so
we've got a single VGA cable running
from the power supply it's kind of
spliced here we've got two 8 pins which
okay at least they have that support but
I wonder how these will hold up when we
plug in two
1080s also be mindful this came out of
the box set to 230 volts which is good
mostly for people in Europe I need to
set this to 115 here in the states that
would have been disastrous I'm not going
to lie that looks pretty clean inside I
can't speak specifically to the wiring
configurations we might have some issues
that might come up because this is so
cheap and not rated by anybody worth
mentioning but it's I don't know we'll
just plug it in the computer and see
what happens
this is probably the most stressful
thing I've ever done on the channel
because if something does go wrong with
the power supply it will likely take my
entire PC with it that's a lot of money
on the line that's ok though because
science right alright so I've got the 24
pin and 8 pin eps extension still
plugged in but they're they're wired
directly into this power supply here and
then I just have the 2a pins wired
directly into the two gtx 280s
this is the most uncomfortable thing
ever okay power supply is there I'm
going to turn it on I mean just to be
frankly I don't expect the thing to just
burn down it's not that cheap but I
still don't advise carrying something
this cheap with a system that's going to
be using close to 600 watts already
under load power supply is the loudest
thing in the system but I expected that
now we're going to run a game we're
going to test GTA 5 just do the
benchmark there loop it a couple times
see if we can't get the power to car
consumption to reach a point at which
the power supply struggles and gets
either extremely loud or just shuts off
completely
I expect 600 watts is actually it's
actually okay for a system like this I
mean you're going to be on the very very
far right edge of your efficiency curve
but I do think that this system here is
probably only going to draw I would say
around 5 550 from the wall I'm hearing
some weird things coming from the pump I
wonder if the pump is being fed a steady
flow of power right why is my frame rate
so low that's a a lot lower than it
should be for dual GTX 1080s hear the
sound so if you hear that there just
some weird pauses in the pump that are
concerning okay at this point while it
looks like it is doing just fine I'm
going to run a few stress tests
simultaneously to basically load up
power on both the graphics cards and the
CPU so we'll run I 264 up top and then
we'll run probably heaven benchmark down
here at superpositions hardcore and I
think that's not properly SOI config get
so heaven benchmark so this one's
getting loaded up and then I 264 extreme
this is going to be interesting alright
so we're going to start first with the
graphics cards get those loaded up ready
to go because it takes a bit of
processing beforehand and then once this
is good which there goes alright you can
hear the coil whine now we will start
the CPU test and here we go
all right so power supply has been
killing it for a little over ten minutes
now and I must say it's actually not any
louder violence a little louder than it
was at idle which is actually pretty
impressive for a power supply that's not
even a d-plus certified it's doing okay
considering the amount of horsepower we
have packed into the chassis over there
now I know it'll test it for a very long
amount of time that's a separate issue a
separate test but I do think that it
passes the out of the box let's plug it
into an expensive PC and see if it blows
up test it didn't do that in fact it
stayed quite cool and the fan was not
very loud at all now the point I wanted
to make regarding power supplies and
efficiencies and ratings is this this is
not rated by eighty plus that's what you
would normally see on a power supply
that semi efficiency ad plus 80 plus
bronze silver gold platinum titanium use
your way up there those power supplies
are extremely efficient now but this one
has no such rating period which means
that it is not very efficient which
means that basically you're going to be
pulling much more from the wall than
your computer will demand so a lot of
that power will be converted to heat
here which is not good it means it'll
run a lot louder that's it in a nutshell
now as a general rule the higher the
wattage of the power supply the more
efficient it should be it makes sense if
you have a really high wattage power
supply let's say a thousand watts and
it's not even eighty plus rated if your
computer is pulling 700 or wants to pull
700 from the supply the supply itself
might be pulling 800 from the wall
because it knows it's going to lose a
hundred watts of that to heat in
efficiencies with a design that's not
good that's a big waste the power supply
is probably going to get very hot and
very loud it tends to matter less with
lower wattage power supplies because the
inefficiency gap is just smaller because
it's pulling less power overall so if
your computer is pulling 300 from the
supply your supply might be pulling 320
330 from the wall if it's a 430 watt
power supply something like that you
soon saying so the margins increase as
the power consumption increases and
that's why the higher efficiencies for
those higher wattages are so important
nonetheless I cannot give this my 102
percent surefire seal of approval that
it will not explode during use and load
because well it's not even 80 plus
certified that scares a living heck out
of me because this is a 600 watt power
our supply it's not like a cheap 230 300
watt power supply then even rate power
supplies that are that low and wattage
because through at a point the margins
are super super small as a general rule
it's a neat little power supply for 20
bucks but from a brand like Zalman that
isn't highly regarded at all at least in
the States in the power supply industry
I just can't recommend it and based on
what I've seen I mean it looks like it's
well built there's almonds a South
Korean company like the Koreans make
good stuff but I I don't I just don't
feel comfortable using it now they make
other power supplies that do look good
they look good I would be comfortable
using some of their other power supplies
in a build like this but this one here
now
20 bucks now if you liked this video be
sure to give it a thumbs up thumbs down
