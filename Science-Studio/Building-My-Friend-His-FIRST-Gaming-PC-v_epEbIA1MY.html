buddies PC here or what will be as PC
all the components are spread out across
the room it's pretty messy in here right
now but he's never owned a PC with
another porous power - you know game and
some modern triple-a titles and like
1440p or 4k so I think we've got enough
horsepower here now we're gonna assemble
everything and see how he likes it at
the end of the day so let's get started
alright so use case scenario for Steve
oh this is gonna be his system he told
me he wants to be able to game on the
system without any problems at all and
he wants to be able to run programs like
SolidWorks so I think the i7 5820k it's
going to suit him very well now we do
have 16 gigs of ram here these are
hall-of-fame ddr4 modules from Galax if
he wants another two you can go out and
buy another - it's you know expandable
and it looks kind of weird only having
two modules in an 8 slot board but if it
bothers him that much he can get more
around later I only have two of these on
hand at the moment so definitely a black
and white theme going on with this board
from asrock and we're gonna carry that
over to the cooler as well so the case
I'm gonna build a system in is the
leanly PC Oh 11 err now I know it's not
the most air friendly case especially in
the context of the front panel but we're
gonna have air pooled in from the right
side of the case similar to how the
dynamic does it and it's pretty good
given the circumstances there so we're
gonna have a 240 ml a IO from deep cool
mounted behind that that you know fan
rad bracket if you will and then we're
gonna put some white and black fans up
front to cover up that radiator so it
looks like the rad spans the entire
height of the case then we're gonna
install this thing it's a one terabyte
SSD from accelerate basically P&amp;amp;Y gaming
spin off division so this should be
plenty of storage for the games that he
has an esteem library and any important
files in SolidWorks and other programs
he might use while in school
this was his card of choice the 1070 TI
from ZOTAC it's the amp Extreme Edition
he asked me you know what the best card
would be for like 1440p gaming hide a
very high settings a 10-7 e TI is right
up that alley it's also 4k capable but
it's more suited to you know the
beautiful in-game settings in the 1440p
resolution obviously if you bump to 4k
you get a dropping game settings and
then all you're doing
enhancing the resolution for a lower
quality image overall I don't really
understand that
so the 1070 is perfect 1440p and he
asked what variant of the 1070 I to
recommend him I said the zotac card I
said really any card that has two 8-pin
supplemental power connectors because
they'll be able to overclock so if you
wants to overclock more than it's
already gonna be overclocked out of the
box you can certainly do that with this
card because this one is a beast
all right so I'm here with my dude Stevo
he is currently at Florida State
University just moved into his new
apartment and he's waiting for the PC
that we build them to fill up that space
there on his desk he's got his phone
there now and I felt kind of bad because
it was bare he's waiting on me and he
was he's been patient because I'm trying
to store some parts for this and
actually he doesn't know that basically
the entire plan I had for his system has
totally changed I didn't tell him this
week so now we were talking about maybe
like an orange or yellow theme built
right because you had a yellow back
plate with that is otech 1070 TI extreme
right so the whole idea behind getting
that to match everything else was based
on the card being an oriented
horizontally right so you can actually
see the back plate but the way that we
talked about doing it where we turn the
card vertically which is okay in this
case it's gonna get enough airflow
because it's pushed far back enough
against the motherboard the way we've
done it you can't see the backplate you
can't see the yellow so that whole car
just looks like a dark gray kind of
carbon fiber and the LEDs of course you
can change to whatever you want but I
sent him the pictures the color scheme
is totally different so instead of
yellow and orange basically I changed it
to blue I don't know how you feel about
blue look at his face I don't know how
you feel about blue but I think I think
you're gonna be impressed with it so go
ahead and open up the email and start
with that first picture and you let me
know what you think alright let's see
what it is oh my gosh dude that's a good
reaction yeah yeah so that is a blue
those custom sleeve cables they're from
my buddy Tony those actually form one of
my first custom loop builds ever blue
sky those are the same cables from that
system and I haven't used them since
then so I figured throw them in your
build makes the building so much better
in my opinion having custom cables so
I'm gonna hate to see him go but they
look really good in your system that's
just a little token for me to you for
helping me out and sourcing the parts
cuz
it's difficult to get all this stuff
together the whole platform changed
that's the other thing I want to tell
you so that motherboard yeah so that
that motherboard is an X an X 99
motherboard which means that you're on
the Intel platform so it's an i7 5820k
so you still have six course you still
have 12 threads like we were talking
remember we were gonna do the risin 526
hundred so in this case you're gonna
probably be able to squeak out a
slightly higher overclock you know just
frequency wise you're gonna get about
four point four or four point five inch
gigahertz with this cooler and the CPU
if you feel like going that high it's a
little higher than you would get with
the 2600 maybe slightly better
performance in games it's really gonna
depend and then of course your ZOTAC amp
extreme 1070 TI sitting in that vertical
graphics card mount the case is from Lee
and Lee it's a PCO 11 air now it's not
known for the best air flow with respect
to the front of the case so I put all
the fans on the back side so you're
gonna basically be pushing air out from
the from the inside of the case if you
notice that your graphics card gets a
little hot because we're actually
pulling air from the graphics card then
you can just flip those fans backwards
but I think it's gonna be okay the way
you have it your cards pretty beefy and
it should be able to pull sufficient air
in through the back or through the front
either way so anyway I've been talking a
lot but just tell me I guess I know
you're just looking at pictures here but
what you liked about it maybe what you
want to see changed I can still work on
this of course I have it here so you can
pick it up or whatever you know we can
fix stuff so whatever you want man
you're the client tell me what you think
so I know we were gonna go with yellow
off the bat because the card was yellow
her had hints of yellow in it but did
you hit it on the point man I don't know
if it could go any better I'm trying to
figure out if you went to the future got
a beast computer brought it back in time
so good you have awesome YouTube channel
but I think you will also uh harness the
power of time travel my friend well it's
funny you say that but time travel
because it's not like it's not a
brand-new system from a CP
perspective right because it's not the
newest gen CPU you could buy right so
that I think the equivalent six core 12
thread now you could just say 8700 K
from Intel even though it's not an X
chipset CPU and it's still a comparable
CPU from core and thread perspective but
again like this just shows you how solid
older hardware is and in the event you
ever want to upgrade you know just a
motherboard CPU swap is all you need
because you have ddr4 in the system and
ddr4 is going to be good for the next
two or three generations we expect data
I mean just the aesthetic looks of it
alone it is just beautiful and then on
top of that this is gonna do everything
I need it to for gaming engineering
programs man you hit you hit it on the
money bro it would it'll it'll do that
for sure I like it that's what I want to
make sure that you had enough CPU
horsepower that's usually what people
tend to overlook they just throw a beefy
graphics card in there especially when
they're on a budget relatively speaking
but you got the best of both worlds
honestly six cores is perfectly viable
in 2018 and then a 1070 Ti is a great
card even though the new newer stuffs
coming out you you know you get really
good deals on these cards now so I don't
fault you it all for buying that at this
point in time I mean I can't wait to try
this thing out man I can tell you that
like this thing is obese man it's a
beast you get that one terabyte hard
drive so all your games and all that
gonna load super snappy including an
operating system we're gonna load up
Windows 10 Pro for you and you're gonna
be good to go it's tempered glass by the
way on the on the left side so it's nice
and sleek it's not going to scratch very
easily and then of course you can again
color coordinate right so if you want to
switch all the colors of the RGB s maybe
you want to go for like a purple theme
or something else it doesn't look too
bad against blue colors and the in the
cables then you can do that so you have
that flexibility hopefully hopefully it
you know treat you well I think you will
I think it is man thank you so much man
I appreciate it I've always been talking
about wanting to build a custom PC but
then I was like oh man I know Greg can
just hit a grand slam with this I was
like Greg man I need a PC can you help
me Oh
I should tell you guys y'all are
watching that Steve when I go back to my
high school middle school actually
earlier in that cuz we played baseball
together growing up did I knew you
wouldn't let me down Greg you were 1
always be in a way like a perfectionist
in a good way you know like like I know
you spent so much time like oh man and
like just to reconfigure and read you
know rework the whole system compared to
what we talked to on the beginning like
I was a little scared at first but then
ugly wait a second this is Greg building
it dude logo on it and oh you want one
of the sign studio logo all right I got
I got one for you I'll stick it on there
yeah all right man I appreciate it
thanks everybody else for watching and
we'll catch you in the next video
there's a science to do thanks for
building with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
