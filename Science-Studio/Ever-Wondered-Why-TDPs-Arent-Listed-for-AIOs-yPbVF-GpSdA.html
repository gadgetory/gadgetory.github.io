cooling capacity the TDP of for example
a dark rock Pro for which our view
tomorrow is literally written on top of
the box more about TDP by the way in
this video right here
liquid coolers on the other hand with
very few exceptions of void this metric
TDP but why the reason has to do with
much of what was discussed in this video
right here
regarding a iOS and why they're
inadvertently lying to your why you
might be misled by what they're showing
you on-screen since liquid coolers use
just that right liquid as their
transferable mediums in place of heat
pipes in the vapor inside the TDP of an
a io is largely dependent on the
temperature of the liquid as well as fin
density surface area pump speed and fan
displacement with most air coolers heat
pipes filled with pressurized vapor
handle the transfer of energy not water
so in the case of the dark rock pro four
seven six millimeter copper lined pipe
stretched from the block below to the
aluminum fins above copper conducts
heater to rate much higher than water so
things equalize fairly quick the tiny
amounts of a parade in facilitating the
rise of heat from the block so much like
a mini water cycle the compound
vaporizes near the heat source and it
condenses near the fins the vapor isn't
absolutely necessary by the way many
cheaper heat sinks don't even have
copper pipes or anything like that but
it certainly does help now with a iOS
and the TDP actually changes as the
temperature of the liquid does so the
true TDP of a liquid cooler is derived
from the system at thermal equilibrium
when the water is warm to a point where
the fan rad combo dissipates heat from
the water at the same rate that it
conducts it from the block this is
usually between 40 and 50 degrees
Celsius to be on the safe side with
respect to the pump now I know that was
a mouthful but rest assured most a iOS
this is what you need to take away from
this don't have particularly phenomenal
tvp's for example the deep pool captain
240 X I doubt it all the time actually
settles in at around 150 watts they're
one of the few companies to actually
list a IOT DP so good guy deep cool but
something to note is that this TDP is
significantly lower than the dark rock
pro force for example despite having
roughly the same bin density and weight
this is because an AO s performance is
strongly linked to its
speed now the same goes for air coolers
but this is where things get really
dicey so the DRP for again utilizes
seven heat pipes but the 240 X boasts
only a single tube of moving water thus
the speed of the water up to a point
does matter in a closed loop with a low
heat tolerance but the fan speed can
drastically alter TDP because of the
fact that water from only one tube is
being pushed to the radiator where its
post to be dissipated right from those
fans so there are several steps that
need to align perfectly for the system
to function the way that it should on a
side note most AIO is recycled the same
a Sutekh pump design while their
low-profile and quiet they typically
don't cycle water quickly enough from
the block and thermally demanding
systems which results in an imbalance
temperature distribution across the
system by the way for those who sport
you know consumer grade hardware up to
maybe the i7 8700 k you're not gonna
venture into this kind of territory with
a 240 ml a io in most cases you'll be
fine pump speed won't matter but this is
exactly what happens with a deep cool
captain 240 X when paired with an
overclocked a 970 900 X which is an egg
fryer there's no other way to look at
this thing I have to run these fans at
max rpm to even give it a chance but if
we assume that the heat building up in
the loop is carried quickly enough from
the block which is the case in most
cases that's where pumps reside by the
way in the blocks of these a iOS then
the fans become the major factor
I imagine deep coal engineers ran these
TDP tests with an out-of-the-box fan
curve which is what most would run their
a iOS at hence the lower TDP rating and
they also allow the liquid in the loop
to equalize at around 40 or 45 degrees
Celsius but in this case with enter Max
and their link max to system which I'll
admit I haven't tested yet they claim is
350 watts plus so how can two AOS with
comparable rat real-estate have such a
vastly different TDP s because the
testing is subjective enter max likely
ran their test under max fan stresses
and before fluid temperatures in the
loop equalized even if we assume they
did one of these two things it's not a
good practice so when temperature deltas
are higher the rate of heat transfer is
also higher it's thermo 101 and it's why
the inter max cooler probably appears to
be a much better cooler than the deep
cool counterpart but this is vastly
misleading if something seems too good
to be true it probably is I mean come on
350 watts and then
the Plus on top of that that's just
that's just a little comical but in my
hunt for other a IOT DPS I always
disappointed course there EVGA NZXT NE
the big box brands out there did not
post a iot dps and their websites and i
have a feeling it's because they're
conflicted tell the truth and reveal
that you're a iOS are actually not god
sends with crazy cooling capacities or
go the inner max route and overhype your
product on the back of discretionary
science in closing i'd like to hear into
max's explanation i don't believe for
one second the cio is capable of
handling 350 plus Watts TDP that's just
that's just insane that's like saying
that you could slap this thing onto any
I nine CPU or thread Ripper CPU assuming
have proper contacts and it would run
like a charm that's just not the case
your fans are gonna speed up to max rpm
and once your fluid equalizes you're
gonna have a really really bad time so
there you have it that at least is why I
think the TD piece of AI o is often to
go unlisted this isn't a science this is
just my assumption based on what I've
seen but I want to know what you think
and I want to hear from you in the
comments below be sure to leave a
comment I'll check them out within the
first hour - of this video going live I
also want you guys to give this video a
thumbs up if you thought it was cool
dislike it if you feel the complete
opposite or if you hate everything about
I think and feel free to do that as well
I will sympathize with you if you wanna
click that red subscribe button that
would be totally cool with me you can
click that Bell notification icon by the
way if you're especially awesome so that
you're notified with videos like these
go live it helps me out every view does
count and I take them all to heart I
appreciate you guys watching these
videos up to this point this is science
studio thanks for learning with us
