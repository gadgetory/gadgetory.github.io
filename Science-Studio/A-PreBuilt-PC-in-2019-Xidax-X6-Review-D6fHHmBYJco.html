admit us PC building enthusiasts tend to
have an elitist attitude towards
prebuilt there's a somewhat justifiable
reason for that up until the last three
or four years pre built companies
haven't really offered a wide variety a
wide selection of parts to choose from
we haven't really been able to customize
according to color or by form factor but
that's changed recently especially with
the mining craze jumping about we have
companies like NZXT build we have
companies like ZX eu' built this PC here
we have companies like origin offering
builders or people who would rather have
someone else though the PC for them tons
of options and that's a good thing and
there's something else that not a lot of
people talk about and that's the fact
that a lot of these companies including
side ax get these parts at a bulk
discount price which means they could
potentially offer you an even better
deal overall than if you went out and
built this system on your own so I'm
going to judge this PC as if I built it
myself I'm gonna price all the parts out
kind of like how I do my Craigslist
videos and we'll see if any markup at
all exists with the Zytek system and if
that market does exist how big of a
markup is it and is it justified in my
eyes so we'll talk about the viability
of pre-built sin 2019 with the current
market you know seeing as though we can
buy storage for fairly cheap now
graphics cards are competitive and
they're in stock for the most part now
so there's a lot of variables to
consider again we'll discuss all that in
this video so stay tuned
whether you're looking for a mid tower
with plenty of room for a stack of hard
drives or a silent profile even under
load the be quiet dark based 700 has you
covered and act fast only 3000 units of
the white Edition you're seeing here are
being made click the link below for more
details
so what I want to do is pick up the
camera and give you guys a POV a
first-person perspective of the inner
workings of the system we'll talk about
each part involved including all the
fans AIO the graphics card the RAM all
that good stuff then we'll pop open the
right side panel and we will check out
design axes cable management what kind
of cable management should you expect in
a pre-built system I know you guys hear
that
that little combination of words
pre-built is that one word if it's pre -
built I don't know whatever you want to
call it that tends to get us enthusiast
again a little apprehensive but I think
you'll enjoy this build I think you will
enjoy the budget the price all of that
it was taken a consideration to give
this system just a viable place
especially in the pre built market but
even for people like you and I who maybe
just want to spend the extra time to
build a PC ourselves we can kind of
coordinate all the colors and all the
components online on site X of site and
then I have it shipped to our front door
already assembled with the operating
system already are ready to go anyway
I'm gonna pick up the camera let's check
it out so this is the system you can see
the case is the BitFenix Enzo and if we
swing around on the front here yeah it
doesn't look like airflow was a top
priority of the designers from BitFenix
so we'll be sure to test it up probably
in a separate video although I'm sure we
will be running a temperature test in
this video of this system we do have an
RX 590 from asrock yeah no they make
motherboards but this is one of their
first graphics cards they've produced at
least the cooler for it as ziox 570 LX
AIO it's kind of zxo Nanao brand we do
have a push-pull config which is a
pretty cool and the fans themselves are
from be quiet these are pure wings to
fans which is impressive and these
aren't the best fans would be quiet
they're not silent wings 3 but heck I'll
take these over generic case fans any
day that week and see we have a 120
million at the back there as well as
rock x4 70 master sli motherboard pretty
beefy vrm there and then the CPU is it
as a risin 720 700 XO
the best AMD consumer grade cpu can buy
right now so there's a fully loaded
system and then we have 16 gigs you can
see they're shredded is a ddr4 3200
Hertz super fast we're gonna be able to
enable XMP with the horizon wills n+
architecture will be a very nice system
for gaming at 590 might I mean that
would be nice to have a slightly faster
graphics card in there considering we
have a really beefy CPU but I mean the
590 is still a good card for 1080p at
1440p
so there's that side of the system you
see what custom sleep white cables
looking really good let's open up the
back and see how the right side is
faring and I mean look it's not like
super great but this case doesn't have a
ton of cable management space so I mean
this isn't bad we got a fan have been
here from deep cool looks like we get a
I don't know what this is for RGB LEDs
maybe and then we got our focus gold see
Sonic power supply 750 why I didn't talk
about that before
but this is a really great power supply
see Sonic is a great brand so a good
choice on the PSU are one terabyte hard
drive is down here in the hard drive
cage and then the rest of our cables are
kind of stash and it's really difficult
to cable manage when you have extensions
because that just adds extra bulk and
length to to the cables back here so I
think they did a good enough job it
doesn't look like a rat's nest per se up
here you know they worked with but they
had it's just a little more cluttered
down here again not much you can do when
you're running extensions especially so
this isn't bad I would give this like a
7 out of 10 6 out of 10 whatever I mean
it's not terrible actually one more
thing I wanted to show you the tempered
glass so this is a tempered glass that
comes with the case it is slightly
tinted a little more tinted than I would
like for a white chassis but it's not to
overkill we do have a site X logo on
there but you can peel this off if
you're not keen to you know blasting
their logo on the pickle house so it's
nice that it's just a sticker you can
remove it and that pretty much sums up
the aesthetics you can see the cases
nicely lift it off the ground so it was
a dust dust filter in there so yeah I
mean the works are there and now we're
gonna see if the works are in the
software so let's plug it in so the PC
booted up fine I did have to sync the
RGB is a little bit you do get an
included little controller here for the
strip that is a line on the top section
of the case here next to the
the to 120ml exhaust fans so this is
nice it's nothing super complex I'm
pretty sure these aren't even
addressable RGB days but nonetheless it
is included
what ZX basically did you get this box
that ships with the case and it's
essentially comprised of the stuff that
you typically get in motherboard boxes
so we have like the sli bridge we have
you know like CD 4 software we do have a
few extra cables for the power supply
that aren't included we just don't need
these and we have the power cable for
the power supply motherboard manual and
that's really about it or from that but
I do want to say when the PC first
booted up you had the BIOS flat splash
screen you can hop into that change the
fan setting that's probably the first
thing I want to do because the system
runs pretty loud stock so tweak the fan
curves and then you could also overclock
if you wanted
I'm not going to overclock it just
enabled xfr so it's gonna kind of scale
frequency on its own that's really all
you need to do unless you're doing some
extreme overclocking with horizon and
then once you pass the BIOS you'll hit
the window splash screen it's the the
startup windows 10 screen where you get
to select your language and your
keyboard layout on all that good stuff
and then you hop right into Windows 10
and from there you can start downloading
your favorite programs alright and our
crystal de smart tests show that they
included in bat to drive is pretty fast
this is one of the fastest write drives
I've ever seen I think you capita around
4,000 megabytes per second and then
writes about 2500 megabytes per second
that's not the best in terms of writes
but again this is I mean this isn't an
overkill system I think it's a well
balanced system and having an MDOT to
like this just gonna mean the OS is
gonna be snappier the games gonna look
quick if you load something on this it's
a 500 gig MDOT - so you could certainly
load important programs on this they
will boot up very fast and once you go
from a hard drive to an SSD and then
from an SSD to an MDOT - it's really
difficult to look back so I think you'll
appreciate how fast this drive is
alright now as for temperatures this
tablet is very curious about because it
doesn't look like this case prioritizes
air flow very much at all the BitFenix
end so which I'll do a separate review
on again with this hardware though the
temperatures with the front panel on and
the dust filters included for the CPU
reached about 60 degrees Celsius 6 do
you want to be precise and then
graphics card only reached I believe it
was 51 degrees Celsius this is under a
50% utilization load for both
simultaneously and then here's the
kicker when I remove the the front panel
I just slid it behind the the case
basically as well as the dust filters
included the temperatures were really
unchanged about 60 degrees again for the
CPU and about 50 degrees for the
graphics card there really wasn't even a
temperature Delta at all for our
graphics card so despite this case not
necessarily prioritizing airflow if you
notice there he'll take let's see one
two three four five six seven eight case
fans in your 8 120mm fans those are just
I mean working overtime even at this
lower fan curve that I have things set
to to get air through the case to the
components where it's you know really
vital so I'm actually pretty impressed
with with the builds ability to stay
quiet and again this is a very
conservative fan curve so if I really
wanted to ramp things up make the system
louder I'm sure these temps would be
even lower so this is a pretty good
result I was actually anticipating that
I would be knocking on this build for
its temperature maintenance but it's
honestly not bad at all so yeah moving
on to the next set of benchmarks and
games alright so I tested five games
just to get a general idea of how well
the system will perform under load I
assume you're buying this for gaming
it's advertised as a gaming PC so that
makes sense the first game we tested was
grant out of 5 in the high preset in 34
40 by 1440 is this is gonna stress the
the system quite a bit more than the
general recommendation say around 1080p
1440p this is a step above that it's not
quite 4k but it is going to push a
system a bit harder than 1440p would but
in the high preset in this resolution we
have 93 FPS on average running the
in-game benchmark and then the lowest
one percent of frames came in at around
64 fps so this is still hovering around
a hundred FPS on average that's good the
frame dips are noticeable if we did an
Intel system it would actually be a bit
easier to run this game in particular it
just depends on the titles that you
intend to play and what platform you're
sporting but I'd say this is pretty good
considering we're playing in a high
preset again and 3040 by 1440 is no
slouch in terms of resolution now a
disclaimer before we
talk about our next game Assassin's
Creed Odyssey this one is a bit of a
workaholic it will stress any system and
my personal Rick sporting r-tx 2017 9900
K and I'm still pushing this exact
preset the same resolution about 50 or
so fps so when this system scores 38 FPS
on average it's actually not bad at all
and then at that lowest 1% of frames
only drop to 33 so the margins there
aren't too bad grinning we are playing
I mean considerably under 60fps so you
might want to bump or a drop rather the
in-game settings here to make up for
that loss in the framerate and that's
exactly we did for our next game shadow
of the Tomb Raider again this is going
to be a game that will stress any
hardware threat even the most expensive
hardware will struggle to an extent to
run this game especially in the
resolution in which we're playing this
in the ultra wide 1440p format we scored
45 FPS on average in the medium preset
so slight bump there because we dropped
down the in game settings and that's
perfectly acceptable 1% Louis frames
came in 236 fps again don't be too
surprised by these two games I just
showed you they are very intense very
difficult to run by any standard so I'd
say this is pretty good given what we
have at our disposal
up next is a much lighter game less
intensive its f1 2017 if you're into
racing games the system will run that
perfectly fine ultra white is actually a
really good form factor for a lot of
racing games as long as the game
supports that resolution that that
aspect so in this case 21 by 9
the average FPS was 91 in the high
preset the Australian Grand Prix map in
wet conditions that's the benchmark we
always run with this game and then the
lowest one percent of frames came in at
75 FPS so not too big a dip again I'd
say this is more than plenty for most
racing gamers out there and lastly to
kind of sum it all up we ran a 3d mark
firestrike score this is just in the
1080p resolution so it's different than
the other benchmarks you just saw and
our score came in at exactly 14,000
actually 14001 to be fair but let's just
say 14,000 pretty cool so you can
compare your system with that of this
one maybe you're sporting a system that
costs only $1000 run 3d more firestrike
see what's quarry again you can pair to
this system here which is gonna come in
at around 1700 bucks if you buy it from
ZX now speaking of the price of this
thing what I'm gonna do to end this
video is price each component out if I
wanted to build a system right
now because you could buy this exact
system right now what's the markup of
this or should you expect to pay a
hundred to two hundred our markup maybe
more maybe less maybe you could build
this whole system for slightly more if
you wanted to build it yourself maybe
you're actually getting a small discount
if you buy pre bill we're gonna figure
that out right now all right so what
we're gonna use this PC part Baker of
course we're only going to search for
parts on Amazon and Newegg those are the
only two places I shop for PC parts and
I can find pretty much everything I want
on those two sites
I get quick shipping with premier and
prime so that's my justification you
don't have to agree with it it's just
what I'm going to do so I'm going to
pick the CP first that is of course the
2,700 X horizon 7 CPU 290 bucks on
Amazon that is nice now the CPU cooler
it's a 240-mile but it's as I'd ax brand
I'm not sure we could buy anything
equivalent to that I know we have like
here this h1 dry pro it's a really nice
AIO from from Corsair so what we'll do
is just include that one because I don't
think we're gonna find the side x1 the
motherboard is the asrock x4 70 master
SLI AC memory is gschool tried and Z 16
gigs 3200 this is it right here 130
bucks memories come down a lot in price
but I would still like to see this price
slightly lower I just realized I had
outlet PC for those I never shop at
outlet PC so I change these to new AG
the prices were fairly similar so not
much of a change there alright storage
we have a 500 gig MDOT - envy me drive
so I think what we're gonna do is go
with something fairly similar again this
wasn't a branded Envy me drive at least
it wasn't on the website I didn't take
it out and look at it so let's just say
it was a Western Digital black this is a
pretty fast Drive I'm not mistaken ok
here the reason right so somebody ran
christened this mark which is what we
did and our results were almost
identical to these here so we're just
gonna assume it's a Western Digital
Drive it's probably not that now the
video card we're gonna type in as rock
and yeah that's what I thought nothing's
coming up so rx 590 can we find the
asrock phantom yes this is it right here
up next is the case it is the BitFenix
Enzo and we're going to add them they
really
if it's the white or the black one
that's the black one there and this is
the white one okay so we'll go ahead and
add that choose the power supply 750
watts see Sonic this is a focus here we
go 106 bucks for that and that's also
sold on new light business now we don't
have an optical drive case doesn't
support that and operating system we
have Windows 10 now this is a part where
I'm going to be fairly frugal because I
would never pay a hundred bucks
personally for Windows 10 home she's not
gonna happen i buy these keys from other
websites it just makes more sense to me
save your money if you can you can also
buy keys on on sites like eBay from old
systems you can recycle those keys so
depends on what you really want to do
what I'm gonna do is add this and I'm
just gonna tack on a $20 $20 manual
price here because that's about the most
I would ever pay for it and we've got
eight pure rings two fans alright that
was uh yeah about a hundred bucks in and
of itself okay so you can buy a quite a
number of RGB strips for a ton of
different prices and of course they're
selling a big kit for forty bucks so we
can give this system the benefit of the
doubt it doesn't include of course their
kit but whatever if you want to drop 40
bucks on it on a build then you could
certainly do that and let's see where's
our system here I'm just going to add
whatever we're gonna call it a mouse but
it's fine it's not really a mouse it's
not included we'll change the price to
30 bucks there we go we forgot the hard
drive we didn't include the hard drive
and I just realized that let's go back
up here at additional storage one
terabyte caviar blue from WD there we go
okay anything else I just realized I
forgot the custom cables if we include
the custom cables that's just throw
another hundred bucks in there let's
just let's just do it I mean you could
get custom cables from cable mod for a
hundred bucks
screw it I'm just gonna call it external
storage I don't know what the heck this
is for 50 hundred bucks we're gonna
click it though and then we're gonna
rename it or reprice it rather one
hundred dollars okay
now we're at 1500 bucks that's not bad
my rule of thumb is around 10% if you
charge more than 10% for a markup it's
probably because the system is really
expensive
this is definitely an expensive build
fifty hundred dollars is no slouch
but I don't think that it's uh I don't
think it's the best markup that I've
seen let's let's go on to a different
company site let's go to NZXT build I
this is not a sponsored spot or anything
I just want to see what NZXT charges for
a similar system just just out of
curiosity because I actually haven't
done anything with bill before or BLD
whatever you want to call it so let's
build now and see what NZXT does has
charged $100 flat fee no matter what so
this should be I'm thinking it should be
cheaper but you see like this is just
you know you just pick games you want to
play at let's do 1440p pick your price
let's say 1500 bucks
let's choose AMD and see it's gonna
recommend us a horizon 5 2600 and our TX
2070 500 gig SSD and 16 gigs of DDR for
basically the same Ram kit and that's
gonna cost about fourteen hundred and
seventy eight bucks so oh that's not bad
but I want to tweak just a little more
with it see what we can get for for a
few extra bucks CPU let's choose the
2700 X let's go big or go home and yeah
looking good let's see what we have for
storage so we have Samsung 860 Evo it's
just a it's a it's 500 gigabyte okay and
then we also have a nine set well we
could upgrade that - that's not bad hard
drive let's do one terabyte there we go
so 1618 so for sixteen hundred and
eighteen dollars or six hundred nineteen
dollars you could get let's see if I can
overview again of the of this stuff okay
cool
alright so 60 hundred eighteen bucks
that includes the Windows 10 software
that includes the standard build service
that they charge 99 bucks the cryo reg
h7 CPU cooler it's not an AI oh you
could add a you know 40 50 bucks for an
extra io it's still coming in cheaper
and you're getting an RT X xx 70 instead
of an Rx 590 and 27 t is a is a definite
good step in a right direction
you're it's just a much better car so
yeah I mean look it depends on where you
shop obviously if you want
you build on your own then this video
really doesn't apply to you but if you
are interested in building a system with
any of these companies in zxe just
started doing this a few years ago Zechs
has been around I believe a bit longer
in the PC building space I know if in
sakes he's been along around a long time
I'm just saying when it comes to the ble
service that's a rather new service that
they offer I would say this is actually
probably a better deal just based on
what I'm seeing here
so yeah look I mean this obviously
doesn't employ friends ext they probably
don't even know I was doing this I'm
sure it's a text don't know I would do
this either but I'm going to show you
guys as much as I can I want to find you
guys the best deals
it looks like NZXT spld service is
slightly more competitive 1618 bucks for
a better system in my opinion I mean I
don't even think it's an opinion I think
it's a fact that 2070 is definitely a
better graphics card and the CPUs
identical the RAM is nearly identical
this is a good price so you guys need to
shop around I will say the sonic system
is is a bit higher price than I would
like to see but that's where I'm gonna
leave it I mean this is ultimately
subjective just find the best deal for
the parts you're getting with a good
warranty on the parts
I know zydeco's idec's is a really good
warranty and I believe in DX D does too
so you guys can just pick and choose I'm
sure some pre-built sar gonna be cheaper
on some sites than others it really just
depends on when you're shopping and
where you're shopping so that is it for
this one folks let me know what you
think about this pre-built and what you
think about pre-built in general in the
comments section below and whether or
not you would consider this build for
this price at its current price right
now I'm sure it will kind of fluctuate
depending on the price of parts in
general though I will say pre belts tend
to be fairly competitive because they
can again buy in bulk so they get
discounts and parts when they buy you
know 50 as raw graphics cards they get a
small discount for buying in bulk it's
good for asrock it's good for this
company and it does sometimes pass along
to the consumer the end consumer as well
so that is something to consider that's
why I won't completely you know shut out
pre-built from this channel I think it
would be naive so definitely consider
them I mean look if you enjoy building I
don't want to take that away from you
sure go ahead do it all on your own I I
mean I kind of encourage that to a
degree but if you're just looking for a
system you don't want to deal with the
hassle of putting it all together
install in the operating system this is
very easy to just pull out of the box
and
setup run right away Windows 10 is ready
to go you just type in your name your
account info and you're all set
so with that yeah again let me know what
you think about it in the comments below
