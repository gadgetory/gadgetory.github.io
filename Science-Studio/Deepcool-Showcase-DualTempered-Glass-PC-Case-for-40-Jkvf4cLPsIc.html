forty to fifty dollar case but not
willing to compromise and super
aesthetically pleasing qualities like
tempered glass the mattracks case from
deep cool this is the 55 model in
particular we'll give you the specs in
the rundown in a second might be for you
this is a MSRP $40 case with dual
tempered glass panels one on the front
one on the side it does make compromises
elsewhere but if you're looking for
tempered glass this has got to be one of
the cheapest dual tempered glass cases
I've ever seen on the market so in terms
of fan and rad support up to a 360 mm
fan red combo up front you can push fans
in front of the chassis itself you might
be a hard press to get air to pull
through these little side vents here so
I recommend putting the fans behind the
chassis wall and then having your
radiator behind that as well you have
space it looks like something else you
will notice that this is not a basement
another cost-saving measure but again
you can keep your cables clean maybe buy
some modular cables some custom cables
for a modular power supply you might go
to get around that and still make it
look beautiful up top up to 280
millimeters of a fan red combo space so
2 140 s or two 120 s and then at the
rear a single 120 fan or fan rad combo
now speaking of compromises I don't want
to give this case you know a bad rep of
course it's only 40 bucks you're gonna
have some things that you'd wish were
there that weren't because of the price
point this actually has kind of fold-out
removable PCI slot covers and they're
pretty good so in a nutshell these are
the ones you kind of have to twist out
and then they stay out you can't put
them back in that's a big compromise but
it's something to keep in mind when
you're buying a case that's only I mean
come on
$39.99 now in terms of motherboard
support up to e-atx because there's no
indention up front so you can actually
fit even server boards in here and you
got two hard drive trays down below here
in the basement it actually might not be
removable I'm not too sure looks like
it's bolted in adequate PSU support from
the rear and then plenty of cutouts it
seems for basically everything 24 pin
USB 3 SATA a pin EPS
fans USB down below a very large cutout
to run your PSU cables to the back of
the case it looks like maybe
three-quarters of an inch or so of cable
management Headroom on the right side so
again you know it's not gonna have
rubber grommets it's not going to have
you know a super-sweet basement but
full-on water cooling support but for 40
bucks you're getting a heck of a deal
especially when you take the tempered
glass into account and by the way if
this doesn't cut it for you you got two
other options that are a little more
expensive and they will come with more
support now if you're interested a new a
iOS deep pool has you covered with the
castle RGB series so you get two
variants a to 80 mil rad fan combo or a
240 mil combo and check it out a new CPU
block design so the idea behind these
aoes in particular with differentiates
of these from the regular Captain 240s
and the captain throw which we'll get to
in a second is the customization that
you have with the RGB so 36
interchangeable lighting modes sixteen
point seven million colors you get that
two-tone kind of CPU block glow along
with two included RGB fans looking
pretty slick in here and they're telling
this new ceramic actual bearing is
supposed to keep it long lasting and
very quiet in your case now I'm sure
most of you heard of the captive 240 X +
1 xx x in a i/o that I know very well
I've used quite a bit I love the way it
looks and I love the way it performs
frankly for the price so for about the
same price about 120 bucks starting in
SRP yet now the captain 240 Pro a
beautiful chassis improved nice connect
chrome accents on the side here a new
radiator and the biggest selling point I
believe is going to be the patented
automatic pressure adjust valve which in
a nutshell is a way for the AIO to
equalize its own pressure distribution
to eliminate the possibility of a severe
leak which a few of you have addressed
in previous videos when I've showcased
this AI oh you say okay I've seen a few
you know comments and review sites and
speaking to the possibility of these
leaking the leak factor being quite high
for a neo like this can be solved with
an automatic pressure valve and I'm very
interested to see what the reviews in
general going to be like with this with
the add-on maybe this is something that
we'll see mainstream on arrows in the
future to prevent leaks in systems now
lastly we're gonna end with the game max
GT you guys have seen this one before
but this one's special
because not only does it have this RGB
accents both in the fan and up top this
is more or less a cooperation with eight
suits and I like seeing
companies working together to bring you
the best products this is a very clean
looking yellow aesthetic looks
especially good when paired with this HP
to talk to Z 370 board by the way you
can plug this cooler here directly into
the motherboard control all the our TVs
on both the board and the cooler
simultaneously with Asus or a sync
software really nice to see love the
simplicity there and I love the way it
looks if you guys like this coverage
plan something up some of the thumbs up
let us know what you're excited to see
and to get your hands on here at the
heat cool booth stay tuned for more
coverage here at Computex 2018 this is
science studio thanks for traveling with
us
