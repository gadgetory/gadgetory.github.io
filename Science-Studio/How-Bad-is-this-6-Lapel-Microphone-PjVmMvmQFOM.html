more details when I first started this
channel under the name science studio I
was unsure of what microphone to
purchase being that I was a baller on a
budget I didn't have much money to spend
at all and I was not a fan of using my
camera's built-in microphone the camera
I was using at the time was like a Nokia
540 l 540 something along those lines
it's a built-in microphone
well sucked at this fault the Pacific
plate is sliding up north and the North
American plate is relatively stationary
kind of moving down but really it's the
Pacific plate that's moving quite a bit
there are pictures of picket fences that
have moved further down a plane simply
from the sliding of one plate over the
other if you look at this picture here
the Pacific plate is on one side and the
North American plate is on another so as
you just heard I was in desperate need
of something much better now you might
be wondering why I'm outside right now
and that's because typically when you
purchase really cheap microphones they
don't do a great job of suppressing
background noise and outside it's pretty
loud the dogs are barking inside the
house because I'm out here and they're
not cars are driving by there are birds
chirping you kind of hear just that
ambient sound of being outside that you
don't have when you're inside and it's
pretty secluded noise wise so I'm out
here just to give you a sample of what
this microphone sounds like in kind of a
worst case scenario it's not very windy
though that would be one situation in
which this microphone would definitely
fail but you know the sound quality is
not too bad being that this microphone
is super cheap we're talking under ten
US dollars and this was actually the
first microphone I ever bought on Amazon
so like I said I've got this lapel
microphone or libel ear microphone
whenever you really want to call it plug
directly into my phone now I needed
adapter for this particular model
because this is only a TRS microphone
which means that if you just want to
look it from a physical standpoint it
has two black bars okay you want one
that has three black bars for most
modern cell phones or it will just
detect the microphone as a headphone set
and that's it you won't it won't detect
the microphone built into it as well so
if I just plugged the microphone
directly into the phone without this
small adapter which has three rings on
this end then the phone would basically
try to play music through the microphone
which of course would not work and it
would never detect sound from this
device so keep that in mind you want
trrs that's three rings on your lapel
microphone versus two two is a no-go
unless you buy the adapter in which case
you're spending way more than you really
need so I want to make a very clear
distinction between what a studio
professional microphone setup would
sound like which is what you're
listening to right now and what's
something like this a three or four
dollar lapel microphone that plugs into
your phone sounds like so the difference
really comes down to two different
things the first is going to be audio
clarity that's how clear your voice
sounds in general it's usually bitrate
is involved if there's any static or
Distortion that just comes with the
quality of the mic it's a condenser
microphone or if it's an omnidirectional
microphone those all play a role as well
also whether or not it has noise
cancelling capabilities this lapel
microphone obviously does not although
there are some microphones like this
that do plug into phones that do have
nodes canceling capabilities keep that
in mind you'll be paying a bit more
though maybe 20 30 bucks which we can do
a video on that separately this is just
about a really cheap setup here my
studio setup consists of an audio
technica 20 35 which is similar to the
20 20 which was super popular as well as
a Yamaha mixer now all of that is
discussed in detail in this video right
here I invite you to check it out for
more info but in a nutshell it sounds
pretty good right and it's all XLR
powered in this case though with a 4 to
$6 lapel microphone you'll notice that
quality and the clarity of the audio
dramatically reduces obviously this
isn't a fair comparison that's not the
point I'm not doing $6 lapel microphone
versus $300 XLR setup that's
what this video is about but I do want
to make the distinction between what a
really crisp audio setup sounds like and
what you're foregoing when you decided
to go with a more portable sound system
the big issue I have with these lapel
microphones though the ones that are
super cheap that don't have any noise
cancelling capabilities is the fact that
they're meant to be right taken outside
of the studio outside into the world
where you can just kind of walk around
have a camera and sync up audio &amp;amp; video
later because there's no noise canceling
capability the sound quality of your
voice gets really really distorted
especially when there's stuff going on
in the background any wind I would say
any music people talking within 20 feet
of you will all be picked up by this
microphone it's super sensitive and it
doesn't do a great job at kind of
cleaning up the sound as it's being
processed by your phone so I've got a
5.1 surround sound system set up right
now playing some music in the background
and every speaker and the subwoofer is
pointed in this direction and we're
using the XLR microphone of course right
now so you kind of get an idea of how
great this microphone does the entire
system does at isolating my voice which
is the point right you want my voice to
be the thing that you hear more than
anything else
now we're gonna shift over to the lapel
microphone and well yeah not too great
the bass is definitely taking over a bit
this is uh not not doable I would say
just because my voice isn't being
isolated enough to where you are
distracted severely by the sound playing
in the background only about 10 percent
volume by the way so that's one big
issue is noise suppression right the
background noise that you don't want
picked up in your microphone these are
gonna do a great job at obviously
there's six dollar microphones but one
of the upsides the fact that these
microphones literally work off of your
phone's power they don't need a
dedicated power store so you can
literally plug and play take this
wherever you go as long as your phone
has power the microphone does as well
look I'll be honest my verdict on these
mics they really aren't too bad you
consider that one cost less than 10
bucks I mean that's less than what it
would cost if you bought a number one at
McDonald's so you're getting a lot of
bang for your buck that's for sure but
you do have to keep in mind that you
cannot go places where it's going to be
extremely loud if you're in crowds if
you're at an event like CES or Computex
for example these mics will not cut it
what we actually used at Computex 2017
was a wireless microphone setup that we
bought on Amazon for about 300 bucks it
comes with two mics and
a receiver that you can kind of stash
atop your camera plug everything in and
run it directly into your cameras to
audio syncs up nice and clean it's not
the greatest setup only because things
are being transmitted wirelessly of
course that wireless transmission is
always going to great audio to some
extent in this case a little more than
the pricier sennheiser options and
whatnot that you can find for around
$1000 but 300 bucks not bad I've got
this one link in the description as
loyal as the super Chiefs $6 lapel
microphones and some that are actually
less than 6 bucks but this one here was
about six dollars for this microphone
look these are just different options
for you to choose from if you want
something that's more professional than
to do a better job isolating sound then
buy something worth around 300 or so
bucks that's where you really get the
most for your money I would say around
300 bucks
or we can take the dirt cheap option and
pay 6 bucks for a lapel microphone like
this it doesn't require a dedicated
power source and that really gets the
job done in relatively quiet situations
like we are in here outside though
things definitely change so I hope you
learn a few cool things about lapel
microphones especially the ones that
plug directly into your phone what you
should look for if you're going to buy
something similar to this for under 10
u.s. dollars equivalent I have them
linked in the description by the way the
ones that I've used in the past or this
one isn't too bad considering it's not
very expensive and you do get multiple
microphones so if you want your friends
to plug in you want to do like a you
know multi person shot and you can
certainly do that and split the audio
accordingly if you liked this video be
sure to give it a thumbs up thumbs down
for the opposite that's the AC unit that
just kicked on hope it's not being
picked up by the mic stay tuned for more
content like this also sub for more
