our will it fry playlists in the first
video we microwave to CPU definitely
fried in this video I have an i3 73 50 K
which should not exist it's a stupid
processor don't buy it more details
somewhere around here we're going to
swap thermal paste which is kind of like
the interface between a heat source and
a heat sink with this right here
a thermal pad now for those of you new
to the scene thermal paste or thermal
grease is sandwiched between typically a
CPU heat spreader and a large CPU
heatsink or a water block something that
helps bridge the gap between the heat
source which is the CPU itself and what
is supposed to dissipate the heat the
heat sink the compound in here and other
variants supposed to be a great
conductor of heat that's the point by
the way to transfer heat from point A to
point B as efficiently as possible but
thermal pads which do the same thing in
essence are not expect the same these
are meant more for prm's via RAM modules
things that get hot but not you know 100
degrees Celsius hot so the mitigation
technique is the same but you wouldn't
want to use this between a CPU and a
heatsink we're going to do it anyway in
this video okay so in goes the CPU now
we're going to run two tests one will be
of course our control our control test
will consist of just typical thermal
paste application we're going to use
some Noctua in th one here it's good
thermal thermal grease so we're going to
slap some of this on then we're going to
use the cryo rig c7 to cool the CPU and
then after we've run our tests we'll run
a few benchmarks to CPU synthetics will
record temperatures we will remove the
cooler remove the thermal paste and then
apply the thermal pad and in case you're
wondering this is three millimeters
thick so here we go with the control
test first slap some of that on there
alright in before the oh that's too much
thermal grease bro or that's too little
man you should have put more than that
that's fine trust me it's fine don't
forget to remove your warning label
alright slap this one right on top there
all right good to go that's literally
all we need to do now let's plug it in
and
some benchmarks this is a beautiful LED
combo by the way
okay Cinebench first remember this is
with the thermal paste the temperatures
should be completely fine here running
its stock frequencies by the way and the
fan curve is just whatever the fan curve
was in the system bios out of the box
okay so max temperature with Cinebench
was right at 60 degrees Celsius so we
will take note of that by the way if
you're wondering seventh or at stock
speeds 4.2 gigahertz turbo boost was 454
CB it's been exit out of that one now
I'm sure we can save that now you're
probably wondering why on earth I am
running benchmarks and not just I 264
which is kind of a CPU stress test
that's because if this CPU does thermal
throttle at all we will see actual like
differences in scores that's just
something else to reiterate here I'm not
saying that it's going to happen but
it's likely that it will it's probably
in a thermal throttle when we swap the
paste for those thermal pads all right
and now Geekbench here we go the highest
temperature running Geekbench for was 55
degrees fahrenheit now it is time to
swap the thermal grease on top of the
CPU spreader here for a thermal pad not
sure if I said this already but don't
try this at home big waste of time not
worth it period clean off the thermal
paste here and on the CPU cooler and
then just slap one of these pads on
there I'll try to cut it down to size
about the size of the die itself alright
let's see something like that yeah that
should do it's not a bad sign oh this
almost this almost hurts it would hurt
if I cared about the CPU CPU stupid dust
or they care all right the CPU cooler
back on there and plugged in to go ahead
and give it a go
alright so right off the bat idle
temperatures are a bit higher we were in
the low 30s before now we're in the low
40s and Cinebench here we go
okay temperatures are going up and up
we're in 70 72 74 75 76 this is not good
77 79
on Jesus 80 91 degrees Celsius 92 please
92 Oh okay so things are freaking hot
right now 92 degrees Celsius 94 we
almost hit T Junction if I'm not
mistaken this is not good at all okay
now I'm going to rerun Cinebench because
our score was pretty much the same here
or score was 451 CV which is only four
lower than our previous run so because
the CPU is nice and toasty now I'm going
to rerun Cinebench to see if we can
instigate that thermal throttling we
were talking about earlier well on that
run exactly the same score 451 again so
we're not thermal throttling and if we
are it's I mean that's barely happening
because our score is basically the same
it's kind of weird I assume that if we
had kept running the Cinebench test over
and over eventually would have thermal
fatigue and see this is basically both
Cinebench runs here so we would approach
the T Junction and once we hit it it
would probably throttle by about five to
ten percent to keep the temperatures
around 90 95 degrees Celsius any more
than that and yeah not good for the CPU
so it makes sense that we're barely
throttling if we didn't have any thermal
pad at all any thermal interface between
the CPU and the heatsink I imagine we
would thermal throttle almost
immediately all right and max
temperature for Geekbench four it looks
like was about 69 degrees Celsius so
that's about 14 degrees higher than it
was with our control test the thermal
pad looks to be in pretty good shape
though so there's that now there are a
couple things we could take away from
this weird experiment you might be
wondering why the heck we even bother
trying it out because I was curious
mainly but you can also learn a thing or
two here the first is that both of these
are still good mediums of exchange
between heat sources and heat sinks the
second is that you should use this for
your CPU and not this I mean you can so
use this I guess I mean you'd have a lot
of thermal throttling issues you'd
probably have a very loud system because
your family be compensating for all that
heat that's not being dumped from your
CPU and but the thing about CP is
nowadays is that they're so
a well-engineered but it's difficult to
force a CPU to overheat and explode or
they'll shut your whole system down
there are so many fail-safes built into
these systems into these CPUs nowadays
it's getting pretty difficult to just
fry one so with that I guess it didn't
fry and that's kind of to be expected at
this point but I have a few more things
up my sleeve for a couple other videos
in the future on this playlist I think
I'm going to try over volt in the CPU
maybe like 3 volts or something
ridiculous see if we can kill the CPU
then I don't know suggest things in the
comments we'll see what we can do to
kill the I 373 50k with that if you
liked the video be sure to give it a
thumbs up thumbs down for the obstacle
subscribe but if you haven't already
I'll catch you in the next video this
science to do thanks for learning with
this
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
