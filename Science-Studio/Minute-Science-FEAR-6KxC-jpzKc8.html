checking us out have you ever been
scared of something and wondered why
being scared is often prompted by the
emotion we call fear and it often has
three rules of engagement that is to say
the thing or a scenario that causes of
the fear must exude one of these three
traits they must either be threatening
dangerous or painful all three of these
traits have one thing in common they are
learned apart from two specific fears
the fear of falling and the fear of loud
noises which are innate and instilled in
our DNA upon conception all of the fears
are learned over time let me give you an
example the fear of spiders
arachnophobia it's probably one of the
oldest fears to exist but newborns don't
have that innate fear if a baby sees a
spider large or small roaming around in
its room it won't naturally resist the
spider in fact it's probably going to be
curious and want to find out what
exactly that little creature is that's
moving around and is only when the
newborn is bitten by a spider that he or
she naturally resists the spiders
malicious intent why are we afraid of
spiders
chances are we or somebody we know have
been bitten by one and we've seen the
results this is a learned fear and most
fears develop in this way but what about
a fear that doesn't have the potential
to cause severe physical pain something
like stage fright
unlike arachnophobia stage fright is a
social and mental fear it has a lot to
do with acceptance and the feeling of
inclusion in a particular group but it
also have a lot to do with the potential
to fail in front of those saint-peter's
now I should clarify anxiety is not just
a mental fear there are physical
repercussions of such a feeling
tense muscles nausea heart palpitations
sweating these are a few of many
possible signs that you may be anxious
as long as humans remain social
creatures the need and drive to want to
perform well in front of peers will
always be followed by anxiety that is to
say anxiety is something that humans
just can't turn off and most of those
people who say they can are probably
lying the only true way to reduce the
amount of anxiety you feel is to get up
on that stage and speak in front of
those peers over and over again but
let's take a step back most fears are
driven by the need to live the fear of
death is perhaps the biggest motivator
of them all and it's a good thing that
we fear death the fear of death drives
our need to stay safe to take
precautions safety measures most of
these things exist because we don't want
to die and it's a good thing that we
don't this is science to do thanks for
learning with us
