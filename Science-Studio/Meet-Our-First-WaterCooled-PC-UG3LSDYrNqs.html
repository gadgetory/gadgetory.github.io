studio and we have another PC bill to
show off to you all this one is based
around the Intel Core i5 4690k and
before you think anything else
yes that thing is overclocked currently
to 4.4 gigahertz and you're thinking ah
come on Greg you can push it a bit more
we didn't want to do that just yet we
wanted to save that adventure I call it
an adventure because that's usually what
it is it's it's very difficult to find
like the highest most stable overclock
possible on any chip whatsoever so I'm
going to save that adventure for another
video if you're interested in that video
click the link here if that link is not
here it's not uploaded yet but please
click the link if it's there I think
you're going to enjoy that video should
be pretty a pretty fun to watch
to say the least you know it's never fun
to crash your computer but it's fun to
watch other people crash their computers
right so what else does this repacking
mul other than the fact that it already
has a ty 5 4690k in there we've also got
it as rock z97 extreme for LGA 1150
motherboard you've seen this one in the
past it's got dr d bone on the bottom
it's got support for AME crossfire and
nvidia sli
pretty much the works everything you can
think of that a motherboard should have
it probably has the rigs also packing
two four gigabyte sticks of g.skill ddr3
clocked at 21 33 megahertz we are
currently running at that frequency in
here just you know turned on X and P
profile ready to go in that case apart
from that we have let's see a power
supply from EVGA 600 watt bronze it's
actually a little higher than the
standard it's not the 725 from centi I
want to go back EVGA just because the
power supplies are a bit quieter and
this one's 80 plus bronze so yeah it's
more efficient and stuff if you're
worried about that but it's just nice to
say on paper
oh it's 80 plus bronze can save you like
two dollars a year on your power bill
maybe not two dollars maybe a little
more than that you get my point
handling the graphic side of things is
an EVGA super super clocked NVIDIA GTX
960 4 gigabyte edition this one is it's
similar to the zotac one that I had in
an older video
this one's actually a bit longer it's a
bit more conservative with you know when
it turns his fans and when it doesn't
and all I did with this one was just
paint the backplate I do like the
backplate I don't think I'm ever gonna
buy a graphics card that doesn't have a
backplate from this point on just
because I really like back plates and I
hate seeing just the circuit boards on
yeah it doesn't blend with my cool white
and black color scheme that I typically
go for so that's particularly why I
chose this one plus I got it for a good
price on Amazon so you know that always
helps make my decision a bit easier in
terms of storage we have an a data 120
gigabyte solid state drive just for our
boot drive things boot up in like five
seconds it's pretty awesome
and then that typical Western Digital
caviar blue 320 gigabyte storage device
for my games whatnot I don't have any
games on there so I don't need a lot of
storage but if you're trying to build a
rig similar to this one you have a lot
of games in your Steam library go for
that one two or three terabyte Western
Digital model like I said I always go
Western Digital because they're freakin
reliable that's what they are they're
just reliable take my word for it
so you just saw from that little test
that GTA 5 is definitely definitely
benefiting from that overclocked I 5
4690k we're reaching about 130 FPS on
the average in GTA 5 at 1080p on all
high settings - MSAA and ambient
occlusion few of those weird settings in
there that we like to turn off just
because they absolutely destroy the GPUs
ability to perform well in games keep in
mind I just have a gtx 960 in here so 4
gigabyte gtx 960 that's not like a card
that is known for producing frame rates
above 100 FPS at 1080p so i'm very
impressed at how well this computer's
performing as a whole I'm very surprised
honestly by how well the overclocked i5
is doing in games particularly GTA 5
which is very CPU intensive but also in
other games that don't rely heavily on
the CPU it's nice to see a CPU and a GPU
working together so wonderfully to
produce a very very playable 100-plus
frames per second gaming experience so
that's about it for this beast of a
build you guys it's a 4690k water-cooled
running a gtx 960 for gear by graphics
card in a pretty sweet and though pro-am
acrylic case if you're interested about
that case in particular check out this
video here where I review all the
features of this case behind me there's
plenty of building room the side acrylic
window looks absolutely gorgeous you can
see everything inside including your
radiators and I love that so if you're a
pretty ostentatious PC builder check
this case out check this video out I
think you'll enjoy what you'll see so
that's it everyone you know the routine
like or dislike if your feelings are
more complicated comment down below
start discussions I'm gonna get involved
as much as I can I appreciate the
growing community be sure to subscribe
if you haven't already we post a lot of
videos like this a lot of techie sciency
videos things you're interested in be
sure to leave comments also about what
you would like to see in the future this
is science studio thanks for learning
with us
