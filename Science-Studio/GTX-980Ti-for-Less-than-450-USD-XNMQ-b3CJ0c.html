been stealing the show no doubt for
these past few weeks
1080 performance blows any current
single GPU card out of the water and
1070 performance rivals and videos own
titan x and gtx 980ti for about $200
less than the latter well that's what I
believe to be the case I promised you
all I'd be purchasing a gtx 1070 to
review and use as my daily driver and
believe me when i get my hands on one i
will but that's kind of the problem
I can't they've been sold out for weeks
I'm not interested in placing my order
now and waiting two to three more weeks
either when I pay for it I want to end
my hands within the next few days I also
don't feel like paying a 200 other
premium to any of these self-righteous
pricks on eBay either I mean come on now
also unlike AMD Nvidia hasn't asked me
to review either of their cards so
needless to say we are all in the same
boat here the gtx 1070 is ridiculously
difficult to come across at this current
time but what about the gtx 980ti
we're talking nearly identical
performance to the 1070 and here's the
catch
nearly identical price in a few
instances I'm maxing everything out in
every single game I play an ultra wide
1080p also just fine in 1440p with high
presets and even squeaking by with
moderate settings in 4k with current
triple-a titles and at a price that
rivals the 1070 Accord with very similar
performance numbers
the 980ti has been the powerhouse for
nvidia for the past year for a price of
around 600 u.s. dollars you could own a
card that more often than not
outperformed it's tight necks
counterpart thanks to third-party
coolers and thus a higher overclocking
threshold and that brings us to the msi
gtx 980ti Gold Edition if you follow me
on Twitter you're already familiar with
what's going on here so thanks for
watching a second time I purchased this
card on Newegg on June 15th of this year
from a miniscule 450 US dollars plus a
$30 mail-in rebate which I've already
mailed out I understand that many
rebates are iffy but as long as you
follow through you can count on it as
free cash in a month or two and from a
trusted brand like MSI it's not going to
just disappear into the nether so how
did I come across this well this is
gonna sound a bit nerdy but I typically
scavenge Newegg and Amazon every day or
so in search of fairly stellar deals and
components that I can purchase and
showcase here on the channel for you
when I saw the msi branded TI le at this
price i could not pass it up if you're
someone who is that's really need of a
powerful 1440p in like 4k gaming card
who is not willing to wait for any of
these 1070 s to just magically pop into
existence I mean come on in video where
are they then these 980 TI s will do
just fine
mister you can come back up here now I
kicked her off of my lap so that I could
pick that box up mmm baby oh it's okay
it's okay
now sure there are a few disadvantages
for opting for high-end Maxwell vs Pasco
the most obvious is probably efficiency
this 92 TI requires to eight pin power
connectors and consumes about 350 watts
under full load the 1070 consumes much
less power and features a lower thermal
output as well 150 watts versus 250
you're also getting only six gigs of
VRAM with the ti instead of eight and
only DisplayPort 1.2 rather than 1.4 has
featured a 1070 though these will be
subjective as to whether or not they're
deal-breakers for you there are a few
things going for the 980ti that the 1070
either doesn't have going for it
currently or will ever have because it's
hardware based the TI features a 384 bit
memory bus for a theoretical 337
gigabits per second versus a 1070 256
gigabits per second although frankly you
won't notice a difference in most cases
the 980 TI is also more widely available
in its current state with brands like
msi gigabyte a suits and others already
on board the 1070 is being rebranded and
sold by these manufacturers as well but
good luck finding
any that you can currently buy and
that's the overall theme here while I
would under every single circumstance
except for this one recommend the 1070
over the 980ti simply for its newer
architecture lower thermal output and
just the fact that it's newer if you
want something similar now and are
willing to compromise on the things Afra
mentioned the 980ti is never a bad
choice for this price I mean come on 420
bucks in several instances that's
actually cheaper than what the 1070 is
currently going for I mean if it was
available now unfortunately the MSI Gold
Edition has since gone bekommen price
and the non-ge card is currently out of
stock no doubt thanks to its stellar
price but I expect other variants of the
980ti to creep down in price as time
progresses this gigabyte card is already
appearing to do so just keep your eyes
peeled and check sites like these every
day or so to stay in the loop look these
cards are gonna have no choice but to
decline in value the 1070 is averaging
around 420 to 430 bucks at this very
moment the 92 t I will not sell here in
the States at least unless it's asking
price drops to a more competitive level
yay capitalism if you liked what you saw
in this video be sure to give it a
thumbs up give it a thumbs down if you
little opposite or gate everything about
light be sure to click Subscribe but if
everybody stay tuned for future counting
on the channel it's a science to do
thanks for learning with Misti and I you
breech ended so yes I appreciate on this
thank you thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
