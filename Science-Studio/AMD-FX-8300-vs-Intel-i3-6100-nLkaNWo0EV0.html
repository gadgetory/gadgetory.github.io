at 2 months or so you know that most of
my PC bills have been based on Intel
CPUs and it's like that for one specific
reason these AMD FX processors are based
on 5-year old architecture now I know
what you're saying Greg they've been
revised multiple times or these things
are more efficient than they were back
in the bulldozer era well ok I see what
you're saying there but this is still
5-year old architect we're talking 32
nanometer transistors versus 14
nanometer transistors big difference
there big difference in single core
performance but what I want to answer in
this video essentially is if you're
choosing between a processor like this
that has two cores and four threads or
processor like this it has essentially
eight cores but they're technically
composed of four cores and eight modules
then which one should you should you buy
did you buy the older processor with
more threads or the newer processor with
fewer threads stronger single core
performance stronger multi-core
performance let's find out which one's
the better buy very quickly I'm going to
put the specs for both of our builds on
the screen right now so you can take a
look at those I think that I have
balanced both rigs fairly evenly so we
used a 990 FX board for the FX 8300
did to 4.4 gigahertz that was a pain by
the way it was very difficult getting
this thing to 4.4 but nonetheless we did
manage to get it there and we used a
kraken x31 in both instances and if
you're wondering how on earth we
overclocked our I 3 6100 to 4.4
gigahertz you can check out this video
in the card above me it's a very simple
process and that's why I have
overclocked the i3 for the sake of these
tests so that further ado let's go ahead
and put these head-to-head see which one
comes out on top
well folks you may love me or you may
hate me for the data you just saw but
that's just it it's data and it's very
difficult to argue it I have pushed both
of these CPUs as hard as I could this
one was literally about to melt on me
and this one's bass clock frequency was
making our RAM act a little strange I
did blue screen of death one time I
think it was running Tomb Raider in
directx12 mode I restarted the computer
we ran the test and it did just fine but
nonetheless I don't think I could have
pushed the CPUs any further than I did
so 4.4 gigahertz for both it's actually
kind of cool that it worked out that way
but that's that's as far as I was
willing to go and have been feeling
somewhat safe about the temperatures
that I was receiving on both I want to
speak for a moment on a memory issue and
that's because I got chewed out for it
in the i3 6100 burst FX 6300 video you
haven't already seen it click the card
above me check that one out but
nonetheless I think I got my ddr3 and
ddr4 frequencies not closely matched now
keep in mind I did not change the ddr4
timing so when I tuned it down from
3,000 megahertz my timings remained and
the same tuning that they were for 3000
megahertz which created a slight
artificial advantage for the FX
processor when it came to memory
management but nonetheless I still think
that 1866 verse 21 33 while this one has
lower caste latencies and this one has
slightly higher caste Layton sees it
kind of balance each other out if you
disagree with me no problem just leave a
comment and we can kind of sort things
out but I think that the RAM was was
fairly matched in both cases as far as
the results go there is no hiding the
truth the FX 8300
which I am getting very frustrated with
for some reason that thing favors lower
core counts and lower thread counts and
I think I'm just going to ditch that
benchmark altogether for the sake of
consistency because my Pentium G 4400
was doing better than my 6600 K you
should seeing how that all played out
click the card above me but nonetheless
I think that that test is a bit flawed
so with that one kind of just scrapped
the i3 really only did better in one
game and it was by a significant margin
but I think that when DirectX 12 starts
taking hold and most of these
games coming out the the higher thread
count will definitely benefit those
games in terms of single core
performance rendering abilities and just
straight IPC the i3 6100 continues to
impress me with its single core
performance it rendered our 1 minute
video file in almost the exact same time
that it took our FX 8350 nanometer
architecture but nonetheless the FX 8300
it's kind of hard to say no to this so I
guess I can conclude the video by saying
the following things if you want to
solve an upgrade path and let's say
let's say you have a z170 motherboard
and you want to put an i3 in it now an
upgrade to an i7 later on you can
certainly do that and in that instance I
would recommend the i3 but if you're
planning on purchasing a PC and sticking
with it for three or four years having
more threads will definitely benefit in
the long run considering the fact that
DirectX 12 is starting to take hold most
triple-a titles so with that having more
threads is gonna be beneficial in
gameplay maybe not so much in a video
rendering photo editing music editing
all that but in the case of just
straight gameplay the FX $8,300
contender I would consider if I was you
that is my final verdict on these two
CPUs with that I want to hear your
opinions in the comments below be sure
to give the video a thumbs up if you
think it deserves one I forgot to do my
thumbs up there it is
give it a thumbs down if you think that
we did something terribly wrong be sure
