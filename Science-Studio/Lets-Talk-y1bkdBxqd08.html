video very quickly this is not going to
be a technology or science ii video it's
just going to be me personally thanking
you for allowing this channel to grow
into what it already has we're
approaching about 3500 subscribers as of
march first 2016 and that is awesome i
would not have expected that two months
ago and it's thanks to one hundred
percent to you that were able to be
where we are today now if you know me
personally you know they like to reply
to as many comments as i can in the
comment sections below of every video
that I upload however as our channel
continues to grow which is a good thing
but it's also a bad thing in this sense
I won't be able to reply to as many of
your comments as I used to be able to so
I have two solutions while it's for I
have two solutions to kind of remedy
this situation here the first of the two
solutions is Instagram you can find us
an Instagram at science studio I'm the
only one who controls the handle so
you'll only be talking to me on that
profile so if you want to know things
about computers you want to see cool
build progresses or just other general
science stuff you can find it all on
that Instagram account the second
solution would be to find me personally
on Twitter at SC ST salazar science duty
was taken for some reason we need to
hunt that person down and reclaim that
handle I don't know why taking on
Twitter not on Instagram but maybe we'll
get it back someday but for now you can
find me on at st st salazar via twitter
and there you can you can just chat with
me and that's pretty much my like chat
medium if you want to just talk to me as
some general questions about computers
want to know if your parts lists are
adequate for what you're expecting to
gain FPS wise and games you can ask me
all that on that twitter handle check me
out there we also have a Facebook page
you can find us on facebook at WWF
facebook.com forward slash science
studio fan base the page was once
dedicated to astronomy and chemistry and
physics topics but our channel has
definitely evolved since then and
there's nothing wrong with that so you
have any question at all about anything
sciency related but particularly
technology or gaming related you can
leave those questions on our Facebook
page I've opened it up as sort of like a
forum so anyone and everyone can respond
and help everyone else out with their
questions and concerns about whatever
they might be concerned about of course
remember to reach us on instagram and
twitter as well and
don't be discouraged to leave comments
on YouTube I do appreciate all the
comments and believe it or not I read
almost every single one of them yes even
the comments and the videos that have
been posted a month ago I see all those
comments and I do pay attention to them
so I noticed that and I do appreciate
the involvement that all of you are
showing and the effort you guys are
putting into your responses and just
helping each other out that's pretty
awesome to see I appreciate everyone in
our community let's make it grow I want
to see these things blow up this is
science studio thanks for learning with
this you're like why wait what did I
learn here now you learn about our
multiple social media outlets see you
always learn something on my channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
