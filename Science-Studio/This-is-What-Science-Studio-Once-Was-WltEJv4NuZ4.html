I'm calling strange science back to my
roots folks I'll be uploading one of
these every week or so just to pay
homage to where we were at one point
this channel used to be called science
studio and for good reason and it's
still my first passion in each video
will be a series of scientific facts
that I found to be strange or baffling
in one form or another think of it as
trivial knowledge but cool trivial
knowledge are you ready for this one
let's begin one light-year is a unit of
distance not time although one can be
derived from the other it's the distance
light travels in a vacuum in one year
approximately seven trillion 878 billion
four hundred ninety nine million eight
hundred and ten thousand miles from a
time perspective it take light this long
one year to travel this distance now
let's consider a galaxy say the sleeping
beauty galaxy it's over seventeen
million light-years away this many miles
away when Hubble and other large
telescopes turn their mirrors towards
Sleeping Beauty they see the galaxy as
it was approximately seventeen million
years ago this is because it takes light
17 million years or thereabouts to reach
the lenses of our telescopes from that
point in space in the same fashion of
sleeping beauty suddenly ceased to exist
we wouldn't know about it for another
seventeen million years we literally
peer deep into our universe's past to
back to earth
Einstein once said compounding interest
is the eighth wonder of the world he who
understands it earns it but he who
doesn't pays it in 1626 native americans
sold Manhattan Island to Peter Minuit of
the Dutch West company for twenty four
US dollars converted if the company had
saved a mere $1 of the proceeds in a
bank account that accrued eight percent
compounding interest today that account
would be worth over ten trillion dollars
this is not a joke
three an internet exchange point is a
physical wired exchange point from
multiple networks on the world wide web
the advantages of IXPs are numerous the
primary ones being cost efficiency and
available bandwidth the largest internet
exchange point is in Germany abbreviated
Dec IX and hosting max data output of
approximately four terabits per second
that's roughly 100 thousand times more
powerful than a typical Wi-Fi router
what you're looking at here is a
graphical representation of every major
internet hub connection in the world Dec
IX resides somewhere in the densest
cluster for all intents and purposes
this is the world wide web for the
world's strongest acid flora and timon
ik acid this hyper corrosive chemical is
formed by mixing equal ratios of
hydrogen fluoride and antimony
pentafluoride the compound is 2 times 10
to the 19th that's 20 contagion times
stronger than the purest sulfuric acid
and has a pH of negative 31 point 3 but
you didn't know that scale went below
zero I sure didn't if you've seen the
movie alien then you're aware of what
strong acids can do corrode metals
dissolve organic compounds burn through
glass while the floor antimony acid is
actually stronger than that floor
antimony acid is typically stored in
PTFE containers when synthesized five
Jupiter if it was 85 times more massive
than it is now enough pressure would
exist at its core to sustain
thermonuclear reactions the same kind of
reactions that fuel our Sun the result a
binary star system that's two stars in
one solar system on a sidenote we're
actually rare we only have one star in
our system most systems that we found
have two or more earth would mimic the
fictional planet Tatooine from star wars
and likely witnessed two sunsets every
24 hours if this were to happen to
Jupiter that's all I have in this
