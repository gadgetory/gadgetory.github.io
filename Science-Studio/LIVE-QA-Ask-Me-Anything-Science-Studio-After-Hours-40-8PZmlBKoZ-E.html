notification although because it's a
little janky at this point I kind of set
this up last minute like I usually do I
need a I need to figure out a way of
doing this and then just leave it alone
right so let me know as usual if my
audio is trash or whatever I know the
video is not that great I'm using the
webcam some reason it's like zoomed in
so you're looking at your boy up close
I didn't plug in the DSLR cuz my capture
card is not in this system because I'm
too stubborn to turn my graphics card
horizontal again because it looks so
dang good vertically so definitely
choosing aesthetics over function in
this case
don't tell anybody else I did that so
what's going on I just wanted to do a
have this live stream kind of as usual
on the Sunday nights that I usually do
them although I am slightly late because
I'll confess I did take a brief nap for
a few hours it was a good nap and I woke
up and I said oops
and then I sprinted to come up here and
set up the stream so I get lots of
questions from you guys in these streams
and they are good questions for the most
part so I'm gonna run through as many as
I can I see people asking about let's
see what are we doing here do the fans
at the back of your room work that's a
good question so they they used to work
they were good fans but I had tons of
NZXT and sent like a dozen of them and
so I was like screw it I'm gonna use two
of them and put them up on the wall
because that looks cool I guess and so
that's that's what I'd just cut the
cables basically at the frame so you
can't see the cables so in theory if you
connected you know PWM ends then these
fans would work I just I snip those off
because who needs cables hanging from
your wall
let's see so it said webcam baby how's
the lawsuit going I'm gonna make a
separate video about that I don't talk
about the lawsuit right now just because
it's no I'd rather sort all my eggs and
my basket before just kind of blabbering
about it but we have a very precise way
of approaching this so I don't want you
guys to think that I'm keeping you in
the dark here I will let you know but
it's not gonna be something that I talk
about very much more until everything is
finalized and I expected to be really
good for us or at least it'll clear us
but there's certain way we're gonna do
this apart from just the motion to
dismiss which I've already submitted but
if you guys want more just kind of
contact contextual stuff you can follow
me on Twitter for more of that like I
posted the filing of the motion on
Twitter so you kind of know where we're
standing now there are other things that
have occurred that are pretty serious
that I have not talked about yet and I
won't do that
until after all of this has settled so
there's more of this story a lot more
that I haven't told you and we'll talk
about that at a later date but for right
now I want to keep things as is because
I I think talking about it any more at
this point is just gonna kind of beat a
dead horse so we'll be good case the
sixty-fifth yeah it's not technically
60fps though the webcams 30 I'm just
kind of upscaling of sample I've always
forget which one it is but I'm
outputting it to 60fps I'm using the the
new in video encoder built into stream
labs that through OBS and so I always
try to I was try to using video encoder
just because it tends to I know that the
the image quality used to not be as
great as x264 but it tends to just
handle itself much better on most of the
systems that I build so you know you can
play a game that's not later you can
probably play like csgo or something
that's not witcher 3 basically
and still be okay encoding on the same
card in my testing anyway but when you
encode on the CPU and you don't have
enough threads or cores in general and
then you also play game that is at least
moderately CPU intensive then it can be
problem so yeah I just do in video
encoder that's it this is just the
generic Logitech c920 I don't know why
it's so sumed in I feel like it's got
like a 50 mil crop on it but usually
like that's a really narrow feel that I
almost feel like the whole thing is kind
of crooked anyway shoutout to Pepsi for
being today's thumbnail sponsor she did
so unwillingly so just yeah what kind of
brush that under the rug and yes I
totally used her as clickbait so no
shame there let's see Bryce Smith
whatever happened to your deep cool
genome case did you like it while you
used to did you ever any problems with
the i/o cooler no problems I used it for
as long as I could use it until I moved
on to some other case but what I said in
that review video still stands but put
the puppet Bob and Callum say Callum is
complimenting me and then he says it's
nice that you don't have clickbait and
then like I literally admitted right
when you type that that I use Pepsi is
clickbait I hope I didn't ruin your I
hope I didn't ruin that compliment at
all I do appreciate it
I like everyone's gonna have a
preference right like I know that I'm
not the only tech tuber out there I'm
not the first tech tuber by any means
and I know there are plenty of tech
tubers who were bigger than me and
they've done a lot of really cool stuff
and everyone's gonna have his or her
competitive advantage it's it's tough to
differentiate yourself and for those who
choose to watch science studio even if
we're not the only channel you watch I
don't expect we're the only channel you
watch in fact I encourage you when you
see review embargoes and stuff go up and
there's like 10 or 20 videos regarding
the same topic I want you to watch more
than one video because a lot of a lot of
the stuff baked into those reviews is
opinionated it's opinion based on fact
so we'll run the test well we usually
all get around the same result and then
we'll talk about our personal
experiences with the card or whatever
isn't you know we're talking about
and if we would buy it and you know take
Brian
so if Brian from tech yes City and I
both get the exact same results we get
200 FPS and we're talking about a
graphics card let's say and I get 200
FPS in Witcher 3 he gets 190 whatever
small differences depending on how we
test in game and all that stuff and then
we get you know 90 fps and apex legends
that would never work like that if you
just roll with it and so yeah our
results are exactly the same and then
our conclusions usually at the end of
the video would you buy this Brian might
say no I wouldn't buy this I would go
buy something on the use market and get
much better value for it and then I
would wait a few use for this new
product to drop I might say look it's
the best thing on the market this is an
awesome graphics card if you need it buy
it I'm not gonna tell you not to him I
can tell you it's a bad deal it's just
not as good as some of the other deals
out there and if you don't like buying
you stuff then there you go right we're
kind of basically saying the same thing
but I'm just I'm looking at this
differently because I know that not
everyone feels the same way and and
Brian does that too and that's important
but Brian might just say don't buy this
card at all and I might say yeah I think
you should buy it's pretty good deal
it's going to depend on how you approach
this mr. pieces I'm rambling I'm not
rambling I'm talking specifically about
reviews and while I'd kind of go off on
a tangent there but it's important that
you guys know that I'm not trying to get
you to not watch other tech youtubers or
anything like that that's to me that's a
disservice to you and it's not really a
service to me like I don't care if you
watch five or ten other reviews because
at the end of the day if you watch my
channel too then we get some of that joy
right we get some of that love back
monetarily
usually it's fractions of pennies but
you get the point right so I don't care
what your youtube search history looks
like I don't care if you watch
predominantly one channel and every now
and then you come over to science duty
and get a second opinion that's okay I
just wanted you guys to know that while
some might see all of us as competitors
and to an extent we are I also think
that it's important that you fill your
brains with tons of viewpoints because
who doesn't like multiple viewpoints
right it helps you make a more precise
and concise decision are you excited
about na'vi na'vi yeah I'm excited about
it but
don't know much about it I mean I know
the premise of the technology I
understand like the you know the I guess
the goals of AMD with Navi but we don't
know much about it so yeah I mix ah me
I'm excited for Navi but I can you could
say I'm excited for tech 10 years from
now so it's kind of a vague vague point
let's see I saw so it says as long as
you don't digress but I digress that's
pretty good oh good old Jay
I appreciate the answer is actually able
to build my first computer largely
thanks to your channel tech yes City
Paul's hardware and Jays to sense I'm
going to put a video about it awesome I
appreciate that Bryce good that good
that you got multiple viewpoints and I'm
glad that you chose science 2d as one of
them RAC says you're from Lafayette
right the answer is no I am from Florida
I've lived in Florida pretty much my
whole life I went to school I went to
college in in Lafayette in Louisiana I
went there for my undergrad and then I
came back to Florida and I did my
graduate studies here in Florida online
at the University of Louisiana see this
PCI 4.0 effect MDOT to write speed read
and write speeds well so the impact to
itself is going to have its own
theoretical limit and then you're gonna
be also limited by the interface PCIe
4.0 I'm sure it's going to I don't know
what the specifications are I know it's
gonna be higher than PCIe 3 obviously
but if if the interface was the
bottleneck then PCI 4 will technically
make your MDOT to you faster assuming
the embed 2 is not its own inherent
bottleneck so because you could put
consider let's let's let's consider like
a cheaper MDOT to nvme drive it's not a
Samsung Drive but it's got really fast
reads and ok writes it's like a 3500
megabyte per second reads and 1500
megabyte per second writes so that's ok
right if it's a four-lane envy me though
there are better drives out there a lot
of Samsung and WD drives for example or
are usually really good I believe the
cap I'd have to go back and watch my own
video about the subject because like we
talked about these limits but I believe
the cap is around Yi I want to say it's
4,000 I think it's 4 gigabits per second
it's something like that I don't
remember what the interface
cap is but it's something like that up
there so if n V amis have a theoretical
limit of like six gigabits per second
and then the interface is only gonna
support up to four gigabits per second
then yes moving from that interface to a
newer one with higher limits is going to
result in faster drive speeds but for
the most part the interface is going to
be you know you you're gonna have plenty
of lead way with the interface and it'll
be the drive itself that is limiting so
it usually it takes time for those
drives to catch up to the new standard
so I'd have to look more at a PCI 4 but
I mean assuming you're talking about
drives that that connect via that
interface then yeah you would notice
faster drive speeds if the driving
questions supported speeds up to that
limit it's double the bandwidth a PCI a3
yeah so you'll basically you're gonna
have a lot more Headroom and then I
expect nvme drives and the like PCIe
drives all of that I mean they're all
kind of by the same interface those will
all you know eventually get to some new
theoretical cap let's see but buh mm ah
P says I came for the cat show us the
cat no idea where she is
that's a eppley you know I think she
knows when I livestream and she just
decides to did ya split I don't I don't
know if I don't know if cats normally
get like lonely I don't feel like cats
could kind of do everything on their own
by themselves and be okay but I mean
it's kind of hard for me to overlook the
fact that a lot of animals are still
social creatures so when I when I leave
the apartment and then I come back after
four or five hours usually when I open
the door she's right there like she'll
sleep right in front of the door kind of
like a dog and I never really had a cat
do that I think a part of it has to do
with the fact that especially when
Lisa's not here or when Lisa goes out
with me she has nothing here like she
just sleeps you know so someone asked if
ray-tracing
is worth it I have many videos on that
subject I'd rather you watch those
videos because I get more in depth in
the technology and if I do think of it
someone says dude focus is on the mic
instead of you actually it's not it's
just the
it's the same I'm literally right next
to the mic the mic just looks sharper
because the mic has little rivets and
stuff
it's a webcam it's not gonna be anything
fantastic
unless it's autofocusing but it
shouldn't there's literally there's
nothing I could do in focus in focus the
same thing same thing
I'm literally next to the mic ancient
ask about the lawsuit again I'm not
talking about the lawsuit anymore until
video comes up or waiting for stuff to
kind of unfold and then I'll talk about
it is it true that 1650s coming this
week that's on the car no idea I wasn't
in for the embargo for the 1660 of the
1660 t.i I do have those cards and I
used the 1660 in a video I expect I'll
do a dedicated review on at least the TI
but I wasn't in a I wasn't in the the
lube for the initial launch of those
cards so I probably probably won't be in
it again later so it means I'll be late
to the to the initial launch and the the
videos usually what I do is I wait for
like a month for the market to kind of
die down and then I'll pick it back up
let's see if you took a laptop to a shop
to have a keyboard replaced in the shop
had kept it for over two months and then
the computers completely does not work
and the guy tells you he can't fix it I
don't know what that was in relation to
candelario mark Martinez Martinez said
the $2 super chat I appreciate that
helps hopes that this helps in the
battle against miss miss grace
well grace computers name a company but
I do appreciate that
I know what I do I know Verdun let's see
you guys I King says oh so the quality
of the Kandra sucks yeah it's a webcam
if you want to watch some of the older
streams I use my DSLR and it's like
super crispy but I don't I didn't want
to set it up I don't have a dedicated
capture card in this system yet and I
don't have room for because the cards
turn vertically I talked about this
early in the livestream but the bow
let's see I could see the 1650 or the TI
being a bit faster than the rx 570 but
at a cheaper price who knows I could be
wrong so I'm mister KF gaming good to
see you those four stars are looking
my phone next to your name and I think
you're right I looked the 16:58 let's
just looking at it like a 1050 or 1050
TI I think yeah there's definitely a
chance that it could be better than the
rx 570 I don't know if the price is
gonna be cheaper than you I mean you can
get rx 570s now for like a hundred and
twenty hundred and forty bucks like
they're pretty cheap so it's probably
not gonna be cheaper than our 570 in my
opinion I think it's gonna be around 160
hundred eighty two hundred not two
hundred bucks it's gonna be I think sub
two hundred but it's barely gonna be sub
two hundred that's my that's my opinion
let's see let's see
will you do a video explaining how to
set up HDR for in-game settings probably
not there's plenty tutorials out there
already for I don't think HDR is like
something to get super I've done without
like when I'm playing Call of Duty or
pub G I could give a crap if my contrast
is like enhanced by 10% like I just
don't care
I'm the monitor I'm using right now at a
live stream this is my gaming monitor I
just got it in but I'm gonna try using
it for about a week or two just a game
with and then I'm gonna do my review on
it and this monitors color reproduction
is pretty trash not gonna lie it looks
like it looks let me see if it's TN it
looks like it's TN it behaves like a TN
panel but you know TN technology's come
a long way I would say most of the time
I don't care at all unless the colors
are just totally blown out of proportion
I just don't really care that much about
it I think a bigger concern of mine is
refresh rate and then a slightly less
pertinent concern is resolution and then
color and all that crap comes kind of
later in my eyes so yeah I'm just not
that big a color reproduction junkie it
matters when I'm like editing obviously
I want to make sure that my videos don't
look super blue or you know warm or
anything like that when I publish but
that's something that's really the
extent fair like yeah as long as the
video doesn't look like it came out of
like a Bluth
or something and we're okay oh yeah
Allah I mean look when you go with an
IPS or VA panel then you have to step
back to TN like it it sucks it does you
know if someone's only used TN for their
entire life than TN is gonna be fine
because that's all you know even if you
only game on IPS panels every now and
then you're still used to T in but when
you make the switch when you fully
switch from one technology to another we
have videos talking about the difference
in technologies by the way if you want
to know how they work and stuff when you
make this switch and you totally
readjust to a new technology and it's a
good technology like VA or IPS then
you're gonna notice the difference going
from that again back to va va is just
are not VA sorry when you go back to TN
it's kind of the same with refresh rates
right like I have people tell me all the
time like Oh 100 FPS plus just marketing
hype it doesn't matter like there's a
small difference but and yeah sure like
the law of diminishing returns kind of
plays a part in that like the higher you
go past a hundred and twenty FPS I would
say the less it really is noticeable
like Lisa has a couple 240 Hertz panels
out front and those 240 Hertz panels are
super smooth but you know what going
from that back to that 165 Hertz right
there that panel it's an AC panel I
don't really notice much of a difference
and I would say I'm pretty a climatic to
high refresh rate panels at this point
I've gamed on several different models
and for the most part anything past 144
Hertz is just kind of you know it's nice
but I don't notice much of a difference
going from that to 165 or 144 no
from 144 to 100 Hertz I noticed quite a
difference and I'm using a hundred Hertz
ultra wide panel here it's 100 Hertz is
definitely better than 60 but it's no
144 or 120 there's just I can I can
notice that 20 Hertz Delta and then
going from 100 Hertz or even 120 hundred
forty-four down to sixty and that just
hurts my eyes and that sounds super
elitist but when you're used to a
refresh rate and then you have to drop
back down to something that is primitive
but you know in comparison then it sucks
so that's why I've kind of always been a
refresh rate junkie I really don't
I don't prioritize resolution because I
think that the the way the image feels
the way it responds is more important
than how you know pixel dense the images
especially when you're gaming my receipt
Mario ji says bro talk to us I've been
answering your questions Mario if you
just got here then you're probably
confused but I do this every QA let's
see yes see Bambi says tea and monitors
suck baby's a little elitist oh no I'm
just joking with you man good to see
again we have a seat
Trojan help I just got a courser carp I
do 75 are acrylic I have five fans and a
240-mile what's the best fan
configuration for maximum airflow never
tested the 275 R so I really can't help
you I can tell you that for the most
part mounting your aio up top is going
to be good if you can try to mount it up
top do that and then get yourself some
intake fans you got five there there you
go don't overcomplicate it it's not
gonna make a huge difference either way
it's really not gonna make it huge of
difference if you want to know just
youtube it google it whatever you'll
find people who have the exact same or
close to the same scenarios that they've
run into that you are right now and you
can fix it up but the Bob let's see here
see the rest if I smoke the answer is no
I've never never smoked I think it's a
disgusting habit and I'm glad I never I
don't know I wasn't even tempt you know
like they have those uh they have those
like campaigns like looking back on this
stuff when I was in elementary school
and middle school he's kind of comical
but like we had this program called SWAT
students working against tobacco and you
know they try to instill you at a young
age the smokings bad and smoking dope
whatever is bad and look I mean the
cigarettes thing I totally understand
like smoking cigarettes is just it to me
it's disgusting and it does no good for
you in the long run so it just doesn't
make any sense to me to get into it on
top of that like my allergies just flare
up like crazy
so yeah there there you go there I
forget what deer stands for but I know
dare I feel like I feel like that's an
acronym too that we had in school Oh
some of you guys know what I'm talking
about anyway yeah I just never got into
it as
I think it's I think it's nasty how do
you get into something that you think is
gross so uh yeah how much have a role
SWAT or dare played into that I don't
think it played much for role at all I
think it was just a way for us and our
friends to kind of laugh and goof off in
class but uh anyway I had you already
talked about the lawsuit I'm not gonna
talk about much more in the livestream
let's see but uh we are going to let's
see IPS 144 is the best combo if you
have the cash to spend but I refresh
rate team will be fine unless you do a
lot of photo editing etc yeah yeah IPS
144 is really good I will say I like VA
to VA is a really good alternative and
we've talked about the differences
between VA and IPS and dedicated videos
so I know how the technology works and
the yeah the downside is really to both
in my experience IPS panels in general
have slightly worse ghosting and part of
that has to do with the technology right
when those I mean inter plane switching
like they call it that because the
crystals have to rotate and depending on
the the charge through each pixel that
crystal basically opens up a certain
degree in allows light to pass the
reason why IPS panels don't completely
shut off unless you have like zone
lighting or something like that is
because lights gonna find its way barely
through and around those crystals but
via a I found for whatever reason is
slightly better for ghosting although
I've had some really bad VA panels and
they all ghost I've seen really good VA
panels as well they're pretty cheap that
are really good at fixing the ghosting
issue but the BA let's see here right a
Callum is like spamming Rison 3000 a320
I have no idea I wouldn't do it I mean
it's just May 3 2003 go great you have
an opinion on risin with video editing
an avid media composer I don't use avid
media I use Premiere so I I can't answer
that
is the livestream r-tx I'm using an RT X
card to stream I'm using the Nvidia
encoder so technically you've seen some
RT x action I'm just there's no rage
racing in this obviously but yeah I'd
like to use anybody encoder
let's possibly reviewing the alkali spur
extreme anytime soon
good point Ozzie I need to do that I
actually need to I need to talk to uh to
David because we were talking about that
at CES I know a few people have gotten
samples but I it's more or less my fault
I never reached out and then got I got
him to send me one so I need to send him
an email thanks for reminding me
let's see the picture behind be moved
which picture which picture behind me
they all been in the same place for
several months but Samsung feed Iran
still worth the price upgrade from low
latency Ram with rise and well some low
latency Ram or some ran that can hit
high frequencies that's designed
specifically for Rison and samsung beat
arisin as far as i know like you can buy
some g.skill kits and whatever that are
finely tuned for the rising platform
especially Zen one right because then
has just a stubborn habit of refusing to
lock in X and P profiles so as then +
fix that for the most part I haven't
really had an issue at all running X and
P on the newer stuff but getting that
RAM frequency on the Zen platform be 350
X 370 chipsets up to 3000 or so
megahertz pain in the butt and so it
would matter there I would choose the
AMD specific hits if you if you're
sporting an AMD platform a risin
platform but let's see someone says a
picture moved I don't know what you're
talking about
any new buy a new AMD hardware not yet
we're gonna hear a lot of good stuff at
Computex I expect so I stay tuned for
that that will be very interesting yeah
let's see
someone said the picture is moving
turnaround hurry or something moving
King RPG I'm going to say howdy until
you respond with howdy howdy hey what's
going on mr. DJ it's how you doing
brother 90-inch TV or 4k projector I
would choose a TV over a projector any
day that's just my opinion
and so yeah I think project I mean 4k
projectors I've seen them I haven't seen
did middle ear II expensive ones but I
have friends that have 4k projectors and
they don't look as good to me as a TV I
mean obviously like it's it's you know I
would say and I do I know like when you
go to movie theaters right all those are
4k projector 'he's probably higher than
that they use the what do they call the
something max imax
whatever their IMAX projectors I mean
think it's straight I should know this
I'm gonna go see end game soon we are at
a point now or I think that just
projectors and TVs are getting really
close to each other in terms of picture
quality but they're just the projector
isn't it's not there yet so if I could
choose between the two I'd choose a TV
assuming they have the same price okay
let's see thoughts on the ring trios for
Thermaltake want to use 6 for my loop
yeah so I've used ring the ring fans in
Afghan a couple of builds the reason why
I don't use them all the time is because
I don't I don't really like the fact
that the the LEDs don't what am I trying
to diffuse in the fans very well so some
fans have really great diffusing
properties that you put like the plastic
that's like transparent and
yeah that's good right but some fans
have a difficult time kind of diffusing
the LEDs so all you see is like these
little colored
sections little zones and I don't really
I said that that's the only reason why I
don't get the ring fans they're good
they don't get too loud and they're
mostly PWM which is nice but I just I
think aesthetically they could have done
a better job defusing the light so once
they diffuse them better and they don't
use that weird logo they like TT it's
just a really big logo doesn't look that
great in my opinion then then I would
consider them for personal builds Stefan
Stefan says congrats on the baby bro
thank you we appreciate that do wish
Lisa was here with us I would love to
have her in this live stream we actually
wanted to do one and announce it on a
live stream before she left it just
things got in the way and yeah so not
sure when we're gonna get to see each
other again apart from when she actually
has the baby so I might not be living
here by myself for a while but that's
okay dark much says wait Greg is
pregnant it's the who's your favorite
piecee mater I mean who is it like I've
met at pcs before I don't really know
what qualifies I think like if you're
talking about companies that like mod
pcs for a living then I would say I
really like the work that mod my mods
does i like envious mods i'm doing like
there's quite a number of that i'm
following on twitter but yeah I follow a
lot of what mob and mods does and they
have like their own store right you can
like buy stuff from them like a
third-party retailer and then I like
envious mod stuff I'm following I'm
trying to think of a few more I feel
like just naming two isn't really doing
its service but anyway there are plenty
of them out there Eric said Craig is
Greg Ninh
let's see Trojan is the 2600 worth it in
terms of features of Verizon - from
rising to over a 17 okay so risin -
technically is not what you're I mean I
know what you're talking about but like
risin - or Zen - is the stuff that's
coming out around copy text I'm what
you're talkin about the 2600 falls into
the Zen plus family
and if you're talking about whether or
not would be good enough to stream the
2500 is good enough if you want extra
gaming performance at a slight
disadvantage when it comes to severe
multitasking then the 2600 is a better
chip if you want a purely multitasking
optimized chip if you're gonna be using
all 16 threads a lot which most games
won't do W premiere export times for
both CPUs actually I think those exact
CPUs of 1700 might have been the 1700
acts but I never overclocked super high
and then the 2600 so I invited to check
those out if you haven't already I think
that will answer your question let's
see-oh 2600 said I just sub-doppler like
and turned on post notifications I
already like this channel if you came
here from a like if you haven't been
here before and you just jumped in on a
live stream and subscribe that's pretty
dope I do appreciate that especially
there in the live stream cuz like these
aren't super big we don't you know I
don't promote the heck out of live
streams like we have like a couple mail
a couple hundred people watching it's
good enough I don't you know if we have
thousands of people watching live
streams then I really won't be able to
get through many of the questions in the
in the chat so in that sense like
obviously having a big stream will be
cool but in this sense I can keep it
more personal and I can you know answer
specific questions and kind of make sure
answer them thoroughly enough so that's
that's nice I think that's I think
that's a plus side to the live streams
okay I wanted to I answered or no no I
see right there so jung jin kim course
there ll fans those look really good
I like course there I really like fans
that have the LEDs in the center I'm
actually the fans that are in this
system right here these are the fractal
prism I think they're called the prison
fans and they sent a kid along with a
couple other things and and I put those
in that rig and I really like those fans
as well so any addressable RGB LED fan
that has excellent diffusive diffusion
properties and that I would say
preferably has LEDs in the center ring
that kind of radiates out from the fan
blades I think those are really good
but let's see here Justin says hey man
what's going on Justin good to see you
appreciate you stopping by we have let's
see here I'm thinking about getting an
i7 8700 K with an RT X 2060 because of
my budget but should I wait for Navi
GPUs if you're building a rig around mid
July I don't know when Navi gp's are
coming to be completely on don't follow
the rumors and craft so look the whole
quit this question like every livestream
I always have to go through this I don't
know if you need to build right now or
if you even need to build in July like
if you want to build mid July and you're
set on that date and you need the PC in
mid July then build a mid July and build
with the best that you have of your
disposal if you want to wait wait but I
can't tell you if you should wait
because I don't know how badly you need
a system so in a nutshell that's all
really the info I can give you on that
because your ultimate ly gonna be the
one that decides when and how to spend
your money we have videos talking about
where I would spend money where I think
the most value is but at the end of the
day if you need something now you have
no choice but to building out right
assuming you can so let's see yes so my
question about stingray says Greg is
youtuber full-time job yep I have a
several videos talking about different
aspects of the channel we have our
finance video if you wanna check out
science to do finances where we make our
money how all that works you can check
out that video I think that'd be a cool
insight for you let's see DB D
Christopher how would you go about doing
a computer repair business from home
instead of a business location it'd be
tough you'd have to so if I was working
out of my home for that and it was like
client-based then I would try my best to
keep it remote in the sense that like I
don't want everyone knowing where I live
so I would probably meet these people in
public or I would meet them like I don't
know maybe I would meet them at their
house right because instead of 50 people
knowing where I live I could go to every
person's house one time and like who
cares like I'm going to people's houses
so it's part of my job it's no different
than calling an 18 D service guy to work
on your internet or whatever so I would
probably go to their houses and just
like comp it or
you know include that in the charge
assuming they don't live far away and
then I would you know troubleshoot it
there with them they could explain to me
what was wrong and then you could take
the PC back home with you work on it so
you could work out it out of your home
and then you could I don't know take it
back to their house and drop it off and
have them tested or whatever and it's
kind of a pain having to go back and
forth but that's really the only way I
can think of off the top of my head that
would not include strangers coming to
your house every week or so to pick up
or drop off a broken PC so yeah that's
tough I saw it stuff I just was really
let's see we have here have you seen the
new Nhu 12a I actually have one in the
closet in my inventory alright I meant
to say my inventory closet that's
definitely a bedroom closet but I turn
this into an office but yeah it's in
there I haven't done the video yet
because cooler reviews frankly kind of
suck because you have to swap so many
coolers out and you have to keep
everything is the same as possible I'm
good thing is now we have those thermal
grizzly carbon op pads which will really
standardize the thermal paste or like
the thermal pad application process so
it's pretty black and white in that
sense now whereas before you would have
to you know try to apply thermal paste
as smooth as possible and as
consistently as possible between cooler
tests and so the fact that we have
carbon on now is really good we have a
review on carbon not if you haven't seen
that video already so that's the Le
$4.99 you watch Game of Thrones not I
haven't watched any Game of Thrones yet
I look I like watching series like that
I do it just takes a lot for me to get
into it like to actually commit upfront
I used to watch a lot of the Showtime
shows that came on I just when I had
Netflix I started watching
Spartacus that was a really good series
and then tutors which is about like
Henry the eighth in England that was a
really good series I've also watched I'm
trying to think
obviously like breaking bad stuff we've
done like we've paid homage to on the
channel Breaking Bad was really good
probably my favorite TV show of all time
but so you know like I would say I'm not
like a huge TV show buff but it's once I
get involved I'm like like all in you
know I'm fully dedicated so it's you
know it's gonna take me a little bit to
get into it and now that all well now
the last season's out to I can actually
watch them all from start to finish and
I'll have to wait for weeks so that
would be nice as well but that's what
games do you play not asking because I
want you to play but because I want wait
because he wants a smart persons
perspective or viewing which game is the
best so the games I play I mean you're
not gonna really gonna get anything
intelligent ice out of this question but
I play City skylines a lot because I
like tae-hyun style games I play Call of
Duty a lot but the older Call of Duty's
because I don't again it takes me a long
time to commit to a new game I play pub
G a lot we play pub G with viewers all
the time in the discord chat and then I
also play I'm trying to think I'm
missing a couple I don't know I think
that's it
battlefield 5 every now and then GTA 5
every now and then like gonna small yeah
but like not consistently but the first
three I named are the ones that I play
the most let's see I'm gonna swing up
okay hey Greg good love your videos your
awesome youtuber I appreciate that
here's my question
oh gosh probably should've read that
before I am for the human time out Evan
okay so I had 100 megabits per second
Wi-Fi and downgraded it to 35 megabit
per second Wi-Fi because of the cost but
I get lower ping in-game buy a good 5 7
milliseconds with a 35 minute per second
Wi-Fi okay it's weird my laptops in the
same place it's a really weird thing I
mean any time you introduce another
barrier
or another bridge your latency typically
goes up but I am in its very small
increments but what might be happening I
don't know how you're downgrading it oh
okay so you're just saying within your
ISP you just called it and downgraded it
from 100 to 35 uh that's a question for
will I wouldn't know for sure that's
kind of strange but will would know that
Will's in the chat well can answer the
questions question he's the one asking
about the hundred 100 megabit per second
Wi-Fi lets you think it would be
possible to resolve more ram into an HP
stream I want an HP stream with 8 gigs
of ram and will do what needs to be done
to it I I don't know what an HP stream
is is that like a laptop I've never
heard of that model anyway if it's
soldered ram then no I see you kind of
screwed there I wouldn't try it not
worth it let's see scrolling down okay I
don't know how to say this pew-pew be
pants I have no idea how to say that do
you ever get pain in your arms or hands
from working with or on PCs every day so
how do you cook the answer is no I mean
I'm not like the most in-shape dude but
like I'm not you know one giant jelly
roll so I thought I can kind of manage
in the office this is not manual labor
by any means so yeah it's not that big a
deal
let's see scrolling down so London says
have to go goodnight thanks for stopping
by London let's see have you ever played
the division 2 yet I have the division 2
actually got it from AMD direct oral
action IMD I got it from power color
because they they they were including
the that game Resident Evil 2 and then
devil may cry 5 in a bundle when they
were selling their Vega 56 cards and so
I got him to send me one of those keys
as well one of those keep the bundle
keys so I can download the other games
problem is it didn't stick it's not in
my Steam library anymore
try that again let's see mode hey Greg
was wondering ah let's see I just lost
the question backup yeah yeah okay we go
I was wondering if you could help me as
to why my Norris 20 atti runs at 85
seeing game and you I feel like it's way
too high for a main menu okay so I would
check your framerate in game like most
of the menus are gonna be locked to
60fps but I don't really have a lot of
context and your question as to whether
or not that's a normal temperature when
you're in game I don't have a 22 TI
horas I have a 20 80 horas and that
thing runs at like 65 C so like that
this one's really chill 85 C is pretty
high for RTX cards in my experience
unless you're overclocking manually and
even then like unless your case has
terrible air flow properties it
shouldn't be too high but check your
frame rate in that in-game menu and see
if the frame rate you know sometimes
when you're in menus or loading screens
the frame rate jumps up to like 3000 FPS
which is just like a high but usually
it's like a flat screen but if it's like
pushing the full frame rate that you
could theoretically get in-game also in
the menu then your graphics card is
working to push out those you know those
frames like it's no different it might
store some of that in VRAM but I'm not
sure if it's gonna know to store the
entire loading menu and the in NVRAM I
don't know how that works specifically I
have to see the gaming question so I'd
say that's not normal I would look into
the framework for sure yes the ACS says
that 83 max is pretty much as high as I
should ever go but most of them reach
only 70 C and that's the yeah mine
reaches like 65 to 70 C so shouldn't be
that high maybe you want to like reseed
the cooler itself top the GP and make
sure thermal paste is good how often
should thermal paste be replaced this is
a question that people are answered
differently depending on their own
personal experience with it but like I
would say every year would be a good
practice you could probably drop it down
to six months or whatever but most
thermal paste
will start to lose their you know
thermal properties after a year or two a
lot of those cards will get really like
they'll have really crusty thermal
compounds in between them to begin with
and those will typically go bad even
quicker so that's why I say a year just
in case but I'm sure you'll find people
in chat that say oh every six months you
should change or every three months I
don't think it's worth changing every
three months okay let's see if someone
said read envious multi comment as
enemies mods in here ah there is he says
hey buddy I heard you're one of my
favorite modders or heard I was one of
your favorite Marty thank you so much
yeah do you know I follow you until I'm
sure you know I follow you on twitter
and I I try to every time I see one of
your posts whatever I try to like him
because you do really good stuff and
that's cool I'm surprised you found out
that I mentioned you that quick but
that's awesome thanks for stopping by my
man our course there h1 15 I stock
thermal paste good should I or should I
buy one a good question I need to get by
with the h1 15 I've stock compound
usually if they're better coolers like
courser is not gonna cripple their own
components with crap thermal compound it
just wouldn't make sense that said I've
seen really crappy paste on a iOS that
are decent a iOS so to be safe I would
say yeah get it because like you never
know when you're gonna have to receipt
that a IO and you it's not good to reuse
thermal paste over and over like that
because you're gonna get air bubbles
trapped and stuff and and that can
affect heat transfer rates and and what
have you so I would buy it just I mean
it's like what five ten bucks like just
throw it in your cart and have it on the
side in case you need it
Roger says hi here from Sweden Roger you
were looking mighty fine with that star
and Xtreme I appreciate your membership
and your support on the channel goes a
long way it really does
let's see Joe keeps asked if I have any
certifications like CCNA I don't I just
know I don't need them not for what I do
one dollar bill are you going to comp
it's copied text are you going to
Computex this year of course we're going
to copy text this year and we're excited
to bring you guys a lot of cool content
we're gonna try to switch it up again I
always try to do something a little
different
and give you guys some you know
behind-the-scenes action my brother is
actually going with me this year and he
will be the cameraman and he's gonna be
kind of vlogging the entire trip on his
own channel he's trying to start up so
I'll try to give him some plugs if you
guys want to know what happens behind
the scenes at these events kind of what
we do hang out where we go eat stuff
like that the parties all that stuff
then I think he'll be vlogging a lot of
that so you get to see a lot of behind
the scenes stuff on top of the cool tech
that we always try to show off every
year these events will spam the discord
if you guys have not joined the discord
I encourage you to do that it is 100%
free it'll cost you zero dollars into
your sense and it's just a good way to
you know communicate with all of us we
share the discord with Bryan from tech
es city if you don't know Bryan you're
living under a rock and I encourage you
to to jump in there let's see hey Greg I
just entered my Mac Pro with a dual 92
TI hybrids into the build that GG a IO
competition would love a shout out well
I guess I guess is that your shout out I
guess so
go check out Brandon Cooper's AIO build
on builds that GG you guys know Bill's a
GG we promoted them before that's a it's
like it's like a really finely tuned
Instagram for PC builders like that says
that's the best I can really describe it
off script like it's a it's got a really
nice search engine you can search for
builds based on like color and I feel
like I'm giving them like a sponsored
spot here but like it's actually a
really nice platform for people to share
their builds and I was talking to one of
the one of the creators of it and I want
to start uploading each one of my builds
there just to have like an archive of
the build because a lot of these get
torn down in a few weeks so it would be
nice to have pictures of each build kind
of as I move through inventory and stuff
but yeah anyway
Wes Wes what's going on Wes what's good
to see you says hello Greg but Papa Joe
says thanks for answering a question
love the channel your views are awesome
really helpful I appreciate that Joe
sorry took my salon answer your question
but I do appreciate your support even if
it's just a viewership that is all I ask
that it really does help let's see shunt
on you I guess is that how you say a
name I apologize if I mispronounced it
hey is Corsair carbides 100 are a good
case
and thanks you and some other tech
youtubers have helped me a lot in PC
billing I'm glad I could be a part of
that help of course of carbide 100r i
have not built in it let's see what are
you let me let me go get the cat ok you
gotta say hi to everybody you're gonna
sit no no you got you ok ok you gonna
say hi to everybody you know of all cats
like that I've ever interacted with she
does not like being held and that's
unfortunate you're a good kitty when you
want to be but then you go all teenager
on me she's like a year and a half I
think so in cat years it's basically
teenagers and she's going crazy all the
time and shedding insanely like just a
ton like she sheds all the time cat fur
is everywhere she's only an indoor cat
is she seriously going back hey get out
of there but hey Dom she's gonna go back
in the box I have a I have a computer
box sitting over there and it's actually
for the for that optiplex build and it's
just sitting there empty right now and
yeah she decides whenever she wants to
jump in there and start chewing on the
styrofoam so yeah it's about time I
showed Pepsi in this livestream because
I totally used it for clickbait and
thumbnails huh
live streams are one of the only things
I'm not gonna know live streams are one
of the things that I'm going to
shamelessly clickbait if I have to
because look we don't have many people
jump into these this is not a
professional setting or anything like
that but I figured I would give it a
give it a shot and see if people clicked
on the video just cuz perhaps it was in
the thumbnail are you excited for halo
on PC good question I really liked halo
I played halo 3 Halo Reach like gosh I
played pretty much like my late high
school mid mid to late high school years
I played a ton of halo
actually not even that's not even fair I
played it from middle school through
high school and I had a Xbox one Xbox
360 and I always played I just I loved
it so yeah the fact that's coming to PC
will be nice but I'm not gonna speak too
soon because we don't know exactly how
well it's going to play yet and what
features are involved so we'll see I'd
like to hold my opinion my official
opinion on the game for after I actually
get to play it oh let's see
Robert says dealing with a cat is like
dealing with a headstrong toddler that
is so true oh gosh you know and I
haven't even like I don't have kids yet
like Lisa's like Lisa's pregnant so
we're gonna have a kid soon and we think
it's gonna be a boy but either way I
think boy or girl at that toddler age
when they start getting independent you
know there and like I'm not even a
parent yet and I'm saying that so wow I
have a lot in store in a few months and
he says I'm all about that halo only
reason I still have an xbox and look
look that's cool too even said that
because a lot of people were like oh you
still a console but you have you build
pcs for living what's that about but
there are some console exclusives that
are really good like I love Gran Turismo
I've played Gran Turismo pretty much my
entire life starting from Gran Turismo
the original one on the PlayStation up
through Gran Turismo sport which is or
GT sport which is now on ps4 I still
have that ps4 it's sitting in the living
room I actually bought it for Lisa
because she likes playing consoles every
now and then too and yeah I mean just
like I don't buy it because I prefer
playing console over PC i buy it because
the the consoles that I have have
exclusives that I can't play on computer
and I just you know there's nothing
wrong with sitting down on a couch with
a controller far away from TV and just
relaxing with a computer you got to sit
right in front of it right you get it
you got to go all-in
but there's something there's like a
casual aspect a casual approach to
console gaming that only really HT pcs
even then they have to be like gaming
pcs can offer so yeah there's a case
there Julian says Congrats Greg my
second girl is due in August
congratulations ours is due in October I
was hoping it would be around
birthday but it looks like sinabi a few
weeks early so that's okay same month
that's still pretty cool we can have
like a combo party you know maybe that
would be a pretty fun
maril OTG $5 super chat I appreciate
that Meryl do we have any updates on
legal issues I've talked about this
earlier in the livestream I don't want I
feel bad cuz you sent me super chat but
I don't want to talk much more about the
court case at this point we've don't
we're gonna do I've already submitted a
motion to dismiss if you want to you
know it's still more up to date on that
stuff you can follow me on Twitter if
you don't have a Twitter I'm sorry
that's just that's just my medium my
media outlet at this point but that's
where I post a lot of the more
concurrent on today's stuff the case has
not been dropped yet but hopefully our
motion to dismiss is is granted or
whatever the official term is accepted
by the judge in the case because I don't
think that Indiana has jurisdiction in
small-claims over a business that
operates in Florida or a person that
lives in Florida so like is he's suing
me and he's suing my business so we'll
see we'll see where that goes but for
now I'm gonna keep quiet and just kind
of let things play out there's a lot
more to the story I said this earlier a
lot more has happened since then you
guys don't know about yet pretty serious
stuff so we're gonna wait to kind of
talk about all this at the end once it's
all said and done hopefully I don't
expect this will actually go to you know
go I don't expect we'll actually have to
go to court and I'll have to defend
myself but if I do I will and I think
I'm more than prepared for it but yeah
we're trying to kind of fizzle this out
legally as quickly as possible because I
just think it's a big waste of time and
frankly a stupid suit so that's all I'm
gonna say
Twitter is for babies at discord is for
adults you have a discord in Twitter are
two totally different things like you
can't really compare them but I do both
so I guess I'm a baby and an adult at
the same time let's see here
yeah sustained is the term thank you the
captain says a motion to dismiss is
sustained that's cool that sounds that
sounds very lawyer II have you ever
tried wallpaper engine it's amazing I
have not hmm
Francis what's your preference symmetric
verse a semi
analog sticks it's a good question I'm
gonna show you what my answer is by
holding up a ps4 controller symmetric
that's my way of doing things look I've
played you know Nintendo even the Xbox
controllers they to me they just don't
like the new Xbox controllers I'm pretty
sure symmetric are they they're not
symmetric I can't even remember I'm just
so used to PlayStation controllers that
they have to be symmetric it's just it's
natural why you can't see it there it's
natural hold it like this for me like
some people like yeah hold a higher blah
blah blah like I feel more in control
the analogs when you know they're both
symmetric when they're both right beside
each other so that's just me
Oh captain says you worked in the legal
field so yeah okay there yeah yeah
you're already predisposed to know what
I'm talking about
let's see here well an i-5 bottleneck on
our TX 2080 or GTX 1080 it'll bottleneck
the GTX 1080 a lot less they're two very
different cards but it depends on the
game I can't really answer the question
without context Sanjeev but but but it
see a couple more questions he ODS is
how about 10:30 we're doing this for
about an hour now time goes by so fast
and we livestream 100 subs with no video
says bro I know you ignoring me I'm not
ignoring you but you just wasted your
potential question with a statement that
really didn't apply so Gigi 100 subs
with no videos Gigi a tube mandala super
sure I appreciate that a coupon good to
see you and hopefully you're doing well
I'll leave $4.99 dude wallpaper engine
room steam you're missing out are you
like spamming that I don't feel like
I've already read that okay let's see
Joseph can oh hello what's going on
Joseph good see sweet bro gtx 1650
already kind of talked about it earlier
in the chat a tube and says LOL free
super chet thank you again eight hoopin
I appreciate it I think we're gonna play
pub G after this will was in the chat
briefly so if you want to ball up and
put G then join the discord takes two
seconds it's free you don't have to
contribute other than just play games
it's totally fine but we do have a
really pleasant for the most part
contributing audience ever know that we
have issues but like what can you do
people are gonna be Dominator and
sometimes but there's a good community
and in the discord and it's not super
toxic which is nice people are gonna be
opinionated that's fine like I had some
rip on my last video for I was reading
something about how I shouldn't have
recommended Dell Optiplex
refurbished from new way I got should've
just bought them on eBay or whatever you
can get them super cheap like like I'm
not claiming this is the cheapest way to
do it I'm just telling you what I did
and the performance I got out of it so I
always encourage you guys to do due
diligence and search every site that
you're comfortable searching to buy the
bet to find the best deal on the product
in question I usually liek Amazon a new
egg so they're tied to our affiliate
accounts and that does help but past
that I mean it's kind of on you to
search for the best of the best I felt
comfortable buying the optiplex on new
egg refurbish because it came with
Windows 10 Pro it was a clean system and
I was ready to go right out of the box
so that was my justification for it but
would I do it again yeah I would
doesn't mean that my opinions wrong you
should I'm saying so people are gonna
you know that's fine like all of that's
sold out like I'm not gonna like censor
anything like that if you don't agree
with something either in the video
that's fine I encourage you to voice it
but like that's like you know stuff like
that happens to people talk about the
videos they see about their personal
experiences that's that's good I
encourage that and that's stuff you can
do in the discord you can share pics of
your build you can again play games with
us
and yeah we have like voice chat so we
all hang out and we'll play one big
custom match of pubsey or whatever
let's see terabyte crafting says played
doom or last day on earth I played doom
when I benchmark but that's really the
extent that I played doom doom was a
very smooth and well optimized game I
really like the way tune plays I am
Groot says so many deals lately and that
is right you know why there's so many
deals because the new stuffs coming out
soon that's when you know that's your
telltale sign all right one more
question give me one more good stuff I'm
gonna read the super chat first because
my case is how's the frivolous lawsuit
so you like the fifth question to ask
that I appreciate a super chat but I'm
not gonna talk much more about it at
this point because I think what's what's
said and done is already done and we
have to wait for the course to decide on
a motion to dismiss if you want more
updates follow me on Twitter that's
where I post most of them okay one more
question here let's see Papa ba mien
Erik their head says have you ever been
annoyed by people repeating their
question asking to make sure I don't
know you know just like don't spam it
you know like
like don't like copy and paste it 20
times because that'll give you either a
timeout or a ban depending on how how
good or bad I'm feeling on that
particular day Zeppelin where's your cat
I already held her up earlier in the
livestream so you got a rewind but the
book that's here okay I'll answer
hundred stops with no videos question
what are your PC specs depends on which
PC you're talking about the one that I'm
using right now as a kurta 990 100k in
it
z3 90 does designator from gigabyte 16
gigs of course there Dom Platts RTX 2080
Horus and then PCO 11 dynamic case EVGA
P 2000 watt power supply some corsair

Combat 7 heck yeah I love that game I
love ace combat I play dayz combat for a
ton on PlayStation on the PS what was it
PlayStation 2 yeah back in the day and
yeah I really enjoy as combat Ace Combat
7 rocked I was so amped for it I kept
seeing it being previewed in the PSN us
on the PlayStation Store the Play Store
where we call it and I was like waiting
I was like come on let me download this
thing so I can play I beat the whole
game in like two days like I freaking
know life that it was so fun and then it
also came bundled with the Ace Combat 5
which I'd never played before not as fun
but I still nice nice it came down a to
pin that is considered spamming if I see
more than like two or three posts on my
page at a time
that's probably spamming just probably
the captain asked what my degree was in
so I have two degrees one of them was a
degree in petroleum engineering and the
other degree is a master Masters in
Business Administration and they're both
from the University of Louisiana but uh
