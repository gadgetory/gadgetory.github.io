some Call of Duty in the background I
will be playing what I'm talking but
it's just some old food to have just
something that you can look at while I
discuss this topic because it can be
kind of dry if it's just me looking at
you telling you about things so I have
something I guess divert half of your
attention but the topic of this video
will of course be about sponsorships and
just getting free stuff that's
essentially what it is but it's not I
don't want you to mistake that for just
charity because they're they're giving
you products to review they expect you
to promote the product in some way or
showcase it in some way or use it in
some way that benefits the company as
well as your channel and it didn't start
receiving free items from companies
until I had about 30,000 or 40,000
subscribers that was when I really
started seeing a bunch of mainly
companies from China trying to reach out
and send things like charging packs
what's the other how Bluetooth speakers
I still get a ton of emails from
companies wanting to send Bluetooth
speakers those kinds of things I did one
of them that was that was it I just
wanted to do one get it out of the way I
think that's kind of something that
every tech tuber has to go through that
whole Bluetooth speaker stage but I got
that out of the way around thirty or
forty thousand subs and then from then
on out I just every now and then just
started getting these random fairly
well-known companies reaching out across
the board just wanting to either let me
know that they could send stuff to the
channel for me to review or that they
wanted a separate video on a certain you
know certain product they were releasing
but AMD AMD raid on reached out to me
and sent a and R X 480 if you've been
around for a while you you know about
that but they sent one to me as a review
sample long before the ark story was
actually released so that I had plenty
of time to run my tests and everything
to be quite honest with you I didn't
actually run any of my rx 40 tests until
like the week before so it was just kind
of sitting around and I hadn't done
anything with it so I was teasing it a
lot and you know getting everybody
pumped up for it but I didn't actually
run any tests until I think the week
prior so even I didn't know how powerful
the card actually was and I wasn't
disappointed with the car I mean is a
great card and I think that it's
probably one of the best price to
performance cards currently on the
market but with that said I think that
that sponsorship was the the most
noteworthy I think that
is a big milestone for science to me
because that was the first time that a
company as big as AMD had ever reached
out to my channel which at the time
wasn't very big I think I had 50,000
subs by that time now in terms of how
you go about getting these sponsorships
you can do it one of two ways you can
either promote similar products and
expect other companies to want to
compete with that product keyboards for
example I have tons of people not
wanting to send me gaming keyboards
mechanical keyboards for the simple
reason that I've already reviewed like
three of them in the past month and so
others are saying hey look at our
keyboard it's cheaper or it has you know
this feature that this keyboard didn't
that you reviewed earlier so that's one
way I would say that you can try to kind
of rally some sponsors behind your
channel or at least companies that would
be willing to contribute products that
you can review and use and do whatever
way through giveaways things like that I
don't recommend trying to sell products
that you've been given for free I think
that's that's just kind of Shady
I don't I don't condone that I don't I'm
not going to do that myself when I sell
computers that I've built I'll sell them
on Craigslist usually what I'll do is
I'll give them a pretty sharp discount
and I'll say hey look all of these parts
were just given to me for free so that's
why you're going to get it for a good
price the only parts I'm charging you
for the parts that I paid for and I'm
just because I built it you know a
couple weeks ago this is I'm just going
to charge you at face value what it cost
me to build I don't usually charge for
labor or anything like that and I sell a
lot of computers that's where a lot of
my old parts go actually I sell them on
Craigslist and things of that sort
we were really nobody in the face of
other channels that have 200-300
thousand subs we're actually coming up
on that as you know that's really crazy
that were that were almost to that point
now but you know back then I think was a
little before the summer started here in
the northern hemisphere I was around 30
or 40 thousand subs and we were growing
we were growing fairly fast but we
didn't have enough in my opinion to
justify a company as big as AMD sending
a card to the studio to review before
and even been released it wasn't just
like it was a free card to review it was
a it was a pre-release card that I could
test myself and formulate conclusions on
before anybody else could buy one just
straight up on the market so that's the
first way you can pick up company
sponsorship start off with something
like a mechanical keyboard
pair it to another mechanical keyboard
later on and then you'll slowly start to
see those other companies who produce
the same kinds of mechanical keyboards
want to compete with you now you're only
going to be stuck in the mechanical
keyboard Department so what you'll have
to do if you plan on sticking with that
I guess course of action is purchase
something like a I don't know purchase
an Asus rx 480 and just kind of hope for
the best you know review that card run
the benchmarks and make the video look
as professional as possible because
these are like your interviews
you're basically interviewing with all
of these companies that have to do with
the topic pan in every video that you
upload because I mean as long as the
video is good and people receive it well
they're going to end up sharing it with
their friends eventually you know word
will get out that hey this new channel
is reviewing these cards and he's doing
a great job this company might hear
about you and say hey we want to send
our product to you and have you do the
same thing because we thought you were
professional in your video now the
second way to obtain free products
company sponsorships review products
things of that sort would be for you to
go out and ask for those products
specifically by either going to the
website and emailing the marketing
department any you know whatever however
you want to do it if you have contacts
phone numbers try all those methods I
will say my personal experience I have I
don't have as much success in that realm
just because I know when I email a
marketing department if it's like let's
say NZXT if I email NZXT is marketing
department I think it's marketing at
NZXT comm don't quote me on that but you
get the point that's just their their
umbrella marketing email so when you
send that email to their marketing
department it's going to get sifted
through by a bunch of different servers
and someone's going to land on that
email until skim it and they'll say yeah
throw it to the side or maybe they'll
forward it to the you know the head of
the marketing department or something
like that that would be a good case but
most of the time they're just going to
be sifted through and then sorted and
then probably trash and that's just
that's just the nature of the companies
they don't have time to focus on on the
little guys really and that's that's I
mean that's still what I am I'm a little
guy right now so until I say until you
get
to around 100 maybe 200 thousand subs
going out to companies and asking them
for products most of the time you're
going to hear the words sorry not right
now maybe some other time
that's usually what I hear so an NZXT by
the way has told me that they told me
that back when I had forty or fifty
thousand subs but I haven't tried since
then I just I don't know maybe I maybe I
will try and txt makes good products so
that's the second way to do it it's not
always going to end with the yes in fact
most of the time is going to end up with
a No
but there are other companies that that
I have been successful in that case with
I will say I've had about an 80% failure
rate with that option it even at this
point I mean I can ask some bigger
companies and all most likely get a no
and that's just because they already
have their there you know they have
their group of people that they always
send things to by default and adding any
other channels to that or any other
people to that just kind of complicates
things there you know and just they just
they like sticking with who they already
know does a great job I don't blame them
for that it's it's hard to break that
that shell but I will say I've had
success with other notable companies
deep cool was a company that I reached
out to you personally about two weeks
later I received an email back from one
of their marketing marketing leads and
she told me she's like hey do you want
the deep cold genome case what color
would you like she said you know we'll
send you a power supply too and an LED
light kit you know they were really cool
about it and it has a lot to do with PR
so the only money they're losing
essentially what they're paying for the
advertisement on YouTube is the product
they're giving away or products so you
know deep cool genomes like 200 250
bucks power supply 50 bucks LED kit
maybe 20 like they're only spending
maybe 300 350 bucks for a potential
audience of you know well over a hundred
thousand people so that's that's a
chance they're willing to take
especially with come with the YouTube
channels that that they see have been
growing quite fast lately and at the
time I think I had 60 or 70 thousand
subs and we were going we were gaining
about 10 to 20 thousand subs a month I
mean it was growing we're still doing
that we're still on that on that track
now which is which is phenomenal
and I hope it stays that way I don't
that's why I don't change the format of
my videos because no that's what
most of you want to see as long as I
keep putting out content you like
hopefully the channel will continue to
grow so that's why I've been sticking
mainly with technology but I keep the
name science studio because I don't just
do technology and I hope someday I'll be
able to kind of transition to to the
point where I can do both freely but
that's a whole number that's whole
nother video so deep cool was a company
that I reached out to that responded
that was very positive about it
an ADIZ if you guys remember the
entities AI crystal review and the bill
that I did with that again I don't know
which side but it'll be in one of these
sides here click that card the entities
AI crystal it's a beautiful
tempered-glass case I reached out to
them actually saw that case on new egg
and at the time it was like a hundred
and twenty bucks sounds like I actually
want that case for computer built I was
like well let me try my luck and see if
they'll just be willing to send me one
because that I'll tell them the parts
I'm gonna include in it you know what I
plan to do with it I'll make it look
good for him and I sent the email
literally the next day they said sure
we'll send you one and in fact a couple
weeks after that after the you know the
couple videos had been released and they
noticed that it got a quite a lot of
attention compared to I guess what they
expected I mean the video had maybe
thirty forty thousand views within the
first couple days so I think they
appreciated that fact
two weeks later I asked them for another
AI crystal they were happy to send
another one so once you once you do get
a product from a company to review or
showcase or you know do whatever with
again it's going to be contractual
whatever you talk about in your emails
make sure to stick to those guidelines
and now this is where the roads diverge
when it comes to companies giving you
products to review you can choose to be
either truthful or a kiss-ass okay
there's no other way to say it you can
either kiss ass and hope the company
appreciates the fact that you do and
ends up sending you more and more stuff
until the until the point where you
become a clone for the company or you
can tell the truth and hope your viewers
appreciate the fact that you are telling
the truth even when the truth hurts for
the company in question now I'm not
going to sugarcoat anything here and
tell you that when you tell the brutal
truth it's just going to work out for
you perfectly companies are going to
hate hearing that okay especially when
they know that you're fairly big in that
you reach of a wide audience and that
the audience is going to receive that
product and probably the same way you
did and end up not making the company
look all that great at least when it
comes to that particular product and the
company's not going to be very happy
about
that's just the truth no one wants to
hear that they don't no one wants to
hear that their products bad but that
that's what it will come down to and in
most cases the company will be
understanding I'm not going to say
they're going to be happy but they'll
they'll at least appreciate the fact
that you had the guts to do that and
that you were honest no matter what and
that you were willing to compromise on
your relationship with the company for
the sake of telling the truth they
always say tell the truth tell the truth
it always works out for you in the end
it might not when it comes to the
company but in most cases your viewers
will appreciate it so coming from
science to do coming from me tell the
truth if you're interested in reviewing
products you need to make this decision
before you do anything else you need to
tell yourself no matter what you will
tell the truth about the product you're
reviewing even if it's a blitz let's say
it's Intel alright and it's a it's a new
processor but the processor is you know
just just terrible I don't know what
about the process will be terrible but
the performance just isn't anywhere
close to what you expected and it was
just hyped up and you know this and that
so you're disappointed with the CPU but
in the video all you do is talk about
how good the CPU is right so now other
people are going to go out and buy the
CPU based on your word only to find out
the CPU isn't all that great I'm using
Intel here because until the IPC change
from haswell's guy like really wasn't
all that impressive so I'm hoping that
cobby lake is we're just just hoping
that it is but just use Intel as an
example here so people going to find out
that what you told them basically wasn't
true I'm going to come back to you and
say Greg that was a lie why did you lie
you're dishonest and they're gonna
unsubscribe to you and then you're gonna
lose your viewer base and then as a
result of losing your viewer base you're
going to lose your company sponsorships
so by doing the untruthful thing you
lose both your audience and your
companies that back you up but by
telling the truth all you potentially
lose is the company so keep that in mind
the goal here is to never give up and
never compromise on video quality on
your review standards keep all of that
intact especially if you've received
good feedback from your audience and
from the companies in question it's
always a great feeling when you have
both company and viewer base support it
really is nice because someone in my
position
a lot of companies that want to send me
stuff but I can't I can't take
everything I can't use everything some
things I just frankly don't want but at
the same time I don't want to flood my
audience with a bunch of stuff that I
know they really don't care about so
computer builds is a big thing for us
right we appreciate computer builds so
whenever it's something like Ramji scale
just got on board I reviewed their
keyboard and mouse they liked the review
even though it's a bit critical a few
things they appreciated it and they said
hey by the way if you want any memory
for any PC let us know we'll send it to
you so gee skills on board right so if I
want to build a computer I'll go to
g.skill and I'll say hey can you send
some of your Trident Z RAM maybe four
four dims with four gigs each for
sixteen total and hopefully they'd say
yes you know and then I would feature
all of the parts I obtained from
companies plus stuff I have to buy out a
pocket in the build and just say look
all these things are running great or
talk about things that I was
disappointed with and just keep that
relationship going because you're your
audience is going to appreciate the fact
that you told the truth and the
companies are going to appreciate the
fact that you even showcase the product
in the first place we're even willing to
accept their products but then that you
were truthful and provided constructive
criticism in the process so that's
essentially what I wanted to talk about
in this video just discuss the things
that I've been through personally with
regards to other companies and receiving
products for free or either by condition
or something like that now straight up
sponsored videos or a totally from topic
and I'm very wary of doing that dumb one
I've only done one sponsored video that
was that be candid video and honestly I
mean it was a pretty compelling offer I
didn't think that the app had nothing to
do with science I thought it could have
been I thought it could be I think it
still is actually a good way for a lot
of people to communicate with each other
ask questions about PC build any kind of
tech questions they have I thought it
was a pretty good medium for that and
that's why I was willing to promote it
but had it been something like again
gardening tools there's no way I mean
they could have offered me 20 grand
there's no way I would have accepted the
$20,000 for the sake of showcasing
gardening tools on science studio
there's no way you have to be willing to
make those compromises for the sake of
keeping your audience happy because your
audience is what ultimately makes you
money it's what keeps the companies
around as
so keep your audience first and the
companies will have a reason to stick
around as long as your videos maintain
said standard this is science studio be
sure to ask questions and other things
in the comments I'll do my best to
answer as many as possible and I'm sure
other people who are kind of familiar
with this topic can help you out as well
