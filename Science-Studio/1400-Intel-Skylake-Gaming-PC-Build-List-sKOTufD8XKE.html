studio and you've likely seen our past
computer building videos featuring
rather modest parts and budget conscious
decisions well that's about to change
to an extent and now I should clarify
the goal here is still to build the best
gaming PC for the price and in this case
our budget has gone way up but that
doesn't mean that we weren't willing to
save a few dollars here and there for
example if an MSI version of a graphics
card is 320 dollars and the gigabyte
version of the same card is $300 we not
for the gigabyte version it's simply
based on the fact that the price is
lower but don't worry we haven't cut any
major corners here that this build is
still one of the best you can find for
around $1,400 so first things first
the processor then right off the bat we
have a confession to make
I know we promised a 6700 K build
however at the moment this video is
being produced the prices for the 6700 K
are outrageous the cheapest we could
find was four hundred and forty dollars
NCIX was out of stock amazon tours to
try again later and Newegg wasn't even
playing ball I mean literally it was
nowhere on new egg so this left us with
no choice but to forego the 6700 K and
book this 6600 K instead but no worries
here obviously the 6700 K has an extra
hand and rendering and executing tasks
but game performance is surprisingly
similar between the two giants we can
also save a bit of money here as well so
Amazon was out of stock at the moment
but they told us more were on the way
and Newegg offered them for around 30
bucks more so maybe wait a few days and
see if amazon has his back in stock
because intel understandably doesn't
supply a stock cooler with their
skylight k CPUs we opted for a water
cooling unit in this case the cooler
master glazier 240 l it features a
single 240 millimeter radiator and
excellent performance for the price it's
ratings by customers were very
compelling as well this custom cooler
will allow us a liberal overclock of our
hefty quad-core our motherboard is the
Asus z170a our ATX board z170 of course
and packed with features surround-sound
sli or crossfire overclocking potential
on both our RAM and
CPU and the nice white accents all
appeal to the board's modest price of
just 159 bucks the ddr we've chosen this
time around no not the same pan ram dims
as before is the g.skill trident z
series pack boasting two eight gigabyte
sticks with a memory clock speed of 32
hundred megahertz stellar indeed with
these speeds expect a few extra FPS on
top of way you'd normally get with the
twenty six sixty six megahertz boost as
for storage we went with both the
Samsung 850 Pro Series 128 gig SSD is a
boot drive and a one terabyte Western
Digital Black Series HDD for general
storage now if you have a few extra
bucks lying around okay maybe not just a
few extra bucks but you get the point
we suggest going fully solid state that
is 86 the hard drive and purchase a
couple of SSDs to finish the job
you won't regret the decision loading
and rendering speeds will double and
even sometimes triple with the upgrade
our video card choice was a bit tricky
we know that there are compelling
reasons to go Invidia in this case
especially with such a generous budget
but AMD's prices were just they were too
difficult to resist the 390x packs a
punch similar to that at the GTX 980 and
for around $200 less this is an example
of that budget conscious mindset I was
talking about earlier if you're in video
for life by all means go for that 980 or
a downgrade to a 970 but to us it just
doesn't make sense to pay more for a
similar performing card or pay less for
a card that doesn't come close frankly
now as for power you probably know the
minimalistic equation we use to
determine what power supply we need so
add up all of your TDP s plus the bit
extra wattage for overclocking Headroom
and multiply that sum by a safety factor
of 1.5 so 800 watts is our sweet spot we
scavenge Newegg and amazon for a great
deal but surprisingly super bias came to
the rescue I've just conceded to the
fact that it's probably pronounced
supervised and they offered an an tech
hcg 850 watt semi modular power supply
for 96 99 we don't recommend purchasing
a cheap third-party power supply I know
it's
tempting but if this wattage you just
have too many reliability reasons to
consider antics HCG m is 80 plus bronze
certified quite a bargain for its
offerings and even comes equipped with
an LED fan not that we'll be able to see
it from inside the case we've chosen
unless you know you're one of those guys
or gals who thinks it's totally cool to
position the power supply fan side
upward especially in a raised case with
legs just point the thing downward okay
and let the light bounce around
underneath the case what case you ask
well the NZXT phantom 530 a full sized
ATX tower seemed appropriate for this
bill does the phantom 530 lino Sebastian
and several others have praised this
case really for its accessibility
features looks and price if you're not
ready for the Phantom experience just
make sure that whatever you pick
supports the 240 millimeter radiator a
full sized tower though is still
preferable the grand total to this build
here is fourteen hundred and twenty
three dollars and seventy cents as of
November 22nd 2015 recording date of
this video I know it's quite a bit of
money but we assure you buyer's remorse
won't be a problem here
games will run liquid smooth if you're
gta5 junkie not a problem
enjoy 4k at 30fps or a generous 1080p
experience with 80 FPS in maxed out
settings we don't include msaa in that
determination
since MSAA pretty much wrecks any modern
GPU at the moment regardless of your
preference you'll have a top-of-the-line
liquid-cooled gaming computer this
holiday season for a compelling price
but if you're not for spending this
handful of cash or check out either of
our other skylight bills in the series

outright terrible job and let us know
