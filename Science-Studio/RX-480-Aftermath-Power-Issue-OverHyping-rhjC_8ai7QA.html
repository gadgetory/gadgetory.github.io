yet seen my comprehensive rx4 80 review
you can do so via the card right here my
initial impressions of the card were
very positive any game in 1080p could
for the most part be maxed out while
still maintaining appropriate frame
rates and 1440p was a breeze as well if
you were willing to compromise on
enhancements such as anti-aliasing and
for a whopping well not whopping at all
actually 200 US dollars for the four
gigabyte model and 240 dollars for the a
key goodbye variant the arch 480 is no
doubt one of the cheapest enthusiast
grade cards available but not all was
shiny on June 29th 2016 so many who were
looking forward to the card ended up
drifting into unknown territory making
claims about a rx 40 that never held up
in court
some purported that the 480 was on par
with the GTX 980 and yet others still
asserted the 4 he would actually compete
with the gtx 1070 these claims coming
from people who had never owned the card
and that's the point I want to address
here
I feel like AMD's been mistreated a bit
so many of you over hyped this card and
that's not necessarily your fault when I
was under my non-disclosure of Y with
AMD I couldn't I suppose correct those
of you who were making those radical
claims I wanted to so badly but my hands
were tied and I feel like this swelled
up into a giant bubble that became the
expectation of the RX 480 and of course
when I and other reviewers released our
benchmarks of the card those
expectations were inevitably not met so
I invite those of you who were very
adamant on rejecting a and B frayed
another cycle due to this quote-unquote
issue to reconsider nothing aimed he
said about their own card was misleading
even the floating-point performance of
the card was on par with what we saw in
the benchmark so I'm not even sure what
was so surprising here another
controversy involves the PCI power draw
issue in a nutshell the card is pulling
more power from the motherboards PCIe
slot than it is from the six pin power
connector now this isn't something that
perpetually happens only during very
minut peak demands for power does the
card actually behave in this fashion the
problem however is that the card can
actually disable eyes the motherboard
being used and cause it to shut off as a
result of sucking too much power from
that lane and I can actually attest to
this firsthand believe it or not I was
in the middle of building my $350 AMD PC
build featuring this card right here
actually and in the middle of every
benchmark just about I think I think
every game did
this the computer turned off randomly no
blue screen of death no warning just
shut off now this is typically
indicative of one of two things either
the computer is not receiving enough
power from the power supply or the
computer is running too hot and shutting
down immediately as failsafe mechanism
well I was monitoring temps throughout
the CPU never reached 50 degrees Celsius
even during prime95 tests and the
graphics card remained within its safe
zone as well around ATC this led me to
initially believe that my power supply
wasn't cutting it the one that I was
using that I undeniably obtained on the
cheap is a 400 watt power supply that's
that's it however this should have been
enough I should have been enough for the
computer I you know kind of did all the
math in my head and it should have had
about 50 to 75 watts of spare still
pushing it in terms of how cheap the
power supply was but it should have been
enough but ok I decided to give the
power supply the benefit of the doubt I
swapped it for this 750 watt supernova
from EVGA obviously no problems with
this one right but still at the same
point roughly in every benchmark the
computer would continually turn off yeah
and I'll admit I was a bit confused at
first it never happened when I stressed
the CPU but when I played games like
rise of the Tomb Raider hit man dying
like gta5 all of these resulted in
system failure so while my 750 watt was
still in the system I swapped the R X
480 with my gtx 980ti
a car that consumes significantly more
power about 350 Watts under full load
and everything ran great actually
I was even receiving great scores in my
benchmarks stay tuned for that video by
the way but now I was left in a bit of a
deadlock I had already tested the arcs
40 for quite some time in my personal
rig so there's no way this card is to
blame and sure enough throwing the card
back into my personal resulted in
absolutely no problems whatsoever which
brings us to the motherboard I was using
an a 78 ax series a m2 motherboard for
my athlon x4 635 the CPU in the AMD
budget bill I didn't suspect the CPU
because CPU issues don't typically
result in total system blackouts just
randomly rather those are usually
accompanied by blue screens of death so
the conclusion I came to then was that
my motherboard was experiencing problems
with power allocation it was being
overloaded more than likely by the
graphics card the arch 480 since the 90d
TI didn't result in the shutdown and
that was the only variable that changed
in that scenario and sure enough after a
quick search online boom the RX 480
power draw
choose via the pci lane made sense and
unfortunately it looks as though the
motherboard I was using was just too I
don't know I guess old is the word I
suppose my z170 motherboard from a SUSE
had zero problems with the RX for 80 but
it honestly shouldn't it's new it wasn't
cheap and it's power phase delivery
system is top-notch so this is what it
boils down to if you plan on purchasing
a reference rx 480 or any rx 40 for that
matter that features only a single 6 pin
supplementary power connector don't pair
it with a super cheap or super old
motherboard the card will end up drawing
more power from the PCI slot then from
the 6 pin which can only deliver maximum
75 Watts by the way and will likely
result in spontaneous system crashes
during especially intense graphical
scenes especially if your motherboard is
not designed to send more than typically
about 75 Watts through the PCI Lane what
I suggest doing for my fellow viewers
who aren't using bright and shiny new PC
equipment and yet are still interested
in the RX 480 is wait for third-party
manufacturers to roll out their versions
of the card in your case I recommend
only purchasing a 480 with something
greater than a 6 pin so something like
an 8 pin or - 8 pin our X 480 these
supplementary power connectors should in
theory remove this power bottleneck from
older motherboards giving you that
smooth gameplay you always wanted but
without the possibility of a system
crash due to power instability so to
wrap things up just remember that the
our X 480 was never meant to compete
with nvidia gtx 1070 or even its older
maxwell based 980 it's price tag and
specifications say so what the card
intended to do was undercut a previous
generation 9 70s and 3 90s with a great
price point here in the states at least
and rivaling performance expect future
maturation of crimson drivers to boost
those frame rates as well only by a
little bit but hey that's how much the
arts 40 lost the gtx 970 and a few of my
benchmarks so it's anybody's game at
this point if you like this video and
the content that was brought up be sure
to give this thing a thumbs up give it a
thumbs out if you feel the complete
opposite or if you hate everything about
life click Subscribe if you haven't
already stay tuned for a $350 AMD budget
build feature in the RX 480
you want a PC on the cheap but you don't
want to achieve graphics card stay tuned
for this thing if it wasn't already in a
card that was previously brought up in
this video
this is science studio thanks for
learning with us
oh and one more thing don't blame AMD or
Nvidia for the extreme outrageous prices
that you're seeing in Europe and Asia
most of what you see in terms of price
hikes with respect to what we pay here
in the States has to do with import
taxes tariffs shipping costs currency
conversions et cetera so no neither
Nvidia nor AMD hates you it's just
business and unfortunately politics
plays a huge role here till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
