Intel this point when it's all said and
done blue team chips aren't more
expensive per watt and often per frame
they often run hotter even after we got
what we wanted with a soldered solution
which arguably didn't change much all I
can speak for today is this little guy
right here the Intel Core I 999 hundred
K it's eight cores and sixteen threads
may look formidable on paper and indeed
this is the best gaming CPU on the
market but only barely and you know what
else looks formidable on paper the price
so regardless of where Intel sees it son
whoops and conveniently this video is
sponsored by blue apron if you're
looking for farm-fresh ingredients to be
delivered directly to your doorstep in
exact proportions look no further blue
apron boxes are packaged safely and
securely to ensure your food arrives
fresh you can cook everything to spec in
40 minutes or less thanks to included a
recipe guys trust me if I can do this
you can too fellas if you're looking to
surprise that special someone after a
long day at PC building blue apron is
your ultimate cheat sheet let me tell
you firsthand keep it classy with blue
apron and sign up today using the link
below by the way the first 50 people to
sign up will save 50 bucks for the first
two meals okay so here we go regardless
of where Intel sees itself in a year or
two with respect to the 10 nanometer
strife the fact of the matter is that
we've been recycling the same generic
architecture for how many generations
now and this by the way is by no means
meant to be an affirmation or a form of
affirmation for the red team I can
appreciate Amy's value proposition I
have several videos talking about this
but it should under no circumstance
justify a wholehearted devotion to said
company all you'll end up doing is
turning future AMD into the current
Intel and nobody wants that so cut the
fanboy crap okay today I put together a
XIII nutty system capable of handling an
all core 5 gigahertz or roughly 5
gigahertz overclock for our core I 999
hundred K our mother mode of choice is
the gigabyte z 390 desig NER a skew
targeted at content creators thanks to
its large array of ports and features
plus it's a sexy board and I like sexy
boards at 5 gigahertz to see
you reach toasty 100 degrees at the
hottest core and 100 degrees at the
package this is T Junction they should
know that beforehand which means these
temps likely would have gone much higher
had the CPU not heavily throttled itself
and this is with a 360 MLA I oh my you
so the best I could do was run a manual
overclock across all cores to 4.9
gigahertz with a manual v core of 1.29
still a great solution for gaming but a
testament to how hot these chips run and
mine is obviously a pretty crappy sample
this thing it doesn't seem to benefit
much at all from the switch to solder
although we do expect the temperatures
to jump a little bit because we're
packing two more cores at around the
same frequency inside a very similar
package see yeah the switch to solder
really doesn't seem to benefit the CP
much at all I mean this could be a poor
solder job or it could be poor sort of
composition maybe both but we just know
the CPU runs hot also at full throttle
msconfig in prime95 the 9900 cave pulled
a roughly 215 Watts through the 8 pin
EPS almost fully saturating that cable
so manual overclocks to 5 gigahertz
likely push a single 8 pin out of spec
which explains why the z3 90 designate
boasts an additional 4 pin CPU power
connection this endorsed by the way the
8700 k's power draw with the same
workload and frequency these extra two
cores are very difficult for intel to
manage and again such a small package at
the same high frequency that intel's
used to running these chips at what
we'll do for the remainder of this video
is look at actual eight core cpu
applications like blender content
creation and streaming will throw in
games as well but this is not something
you want to buy just strictly for gaming
I don't think at this point because you
can get you as you'll see here shortly
six core variants that perform almost
identically and to reiterate many
multi-threaded workloads still won't
properly utilize 16 threads let alone
eight this all comes back to the point
of the core race to begin with so AMD
emphasized higher core count since
arguably bulldozer but they didn't stop
cutting corners until Rison at which
point eight cores the true eight cores
more than FX architecture here became
rather mainstream so despite their
lackluster improvements over four and
six core counterparts Rison seven series
CPUs have been doing quite well in the
consumer market and that leads us
finally to the eight
or Intel equivalent today the remaining
CPUs were overclocked to their highest
stable frequencies with the same 360 ml
a IO so we have 4.90 Gertz for the 8700
K and 8600 K to match our 9900 K
conveniently and 4.2 gigahertz for the
2700 X we're going to test in this video
as well the same 16 gig kit of 3000
megahertz of ddr4 from Corsair was also
used for all three actually all four of
these tests so the 9900 K is just barely
the best gaming CPU around at this point
we expect nothing less but most of the
margins here between our top three
contenders in particular are extremely
slim in fact even our core i5
overclocked before point nine is working
wonders with its six cores and 6 threads
remember no multi-threading here and
this extends often into four core
territory as well though marketing hype
over core counts would lead you to
believe that four core CPUs are
inadequate for gaming a 20-18 to be
completely honest if I shoved an i5 7400
into the mix which I did for a couple of
games the step-down and framerate is
typically very gradual now sure there
are exceptions it's easy to point out
the exceptions right but I can count on
one hand the number of games today that
appropriately utilize more than four
cores and that's saying something so
games today still largely leverage
frequency and IPC and in the case of GTA
v optimization in general is probably a
stronger factor I would say than
anything else although this does lean
slightly in favor of Intel I think we
get a better representation overall of
what to expect in most games now where
we start to see this fall apart is in
the streaming department so while
hosting a 5 megabit per second stream
which is pretty conservative with an
x264 encoder which stresses the cpu the
staircase widens out just a bit but
while the 9900 K does a significantly
better job than say the core i5
the 8700 K and 2700 X still hold their
own in fact you'd be hard-pressed to
tell the difference between any of these
CPUs while streaming and gaming
simultaneously let alone one or the
other
especially when over clogged all of
these CPUs are up to the task yes even
our core i5 at 4.9 it obviously isn't
the optimal solution but it'll do so far
all we've gotten from our core i9 over
its small
counterparts is a hotter room and
significantly more power drum I said
this in a previous video but I need to
be extremely impressed with at least one
aspect of these tests for the 9900 K in
order to recommend it at its current
selling price of around 500 bucks
assuming it's even in stock for that
price so let's try a rendering that
Adobe Premiere isn't the best program
admittedly to run in the sense that it
doesn't properly utilize much past
around 6 threads but it's the program
that I use on a near daily basis for
video editing and rendering the Adobe
suite though painfully frustrating at
times is great at what it does and
that's why it is so popular so starting
out I dragged a one-minute 4k 30fps
video clip onto the timeline and applied
the warp stabiliser distortion effect
which attempts to smooth out shaky
footage our testing several months ago
revealed that this is a largely single
threaded workload so we shouldn't expect
to see much of a difference here between
our core I 9 and Core i5 counterparts
and sure enough things are quite similar
across the board for the blue team our
frequencies match the architecture is
practically unchanged and the remainder
of our system was literally identical
next up scrubbing a heavy timeline at
full scale a weaker chips will fail this
test pretty hard ultimately this just
comes down to subjectivity if I notice
that the timeline is scrubbing better
you know I have less skips overall for a
certain CPU over a competitor it'll rank
higher on this chart so in this case the
i9 is definitely scrubbing better than
the 8700 K which in turn scrubbed
significantly better than its arisin
counterpart likely due to the presence
of an IG P in these Intel chips Premiere
Pro software enhancements pretty recent
software enhancements along with quick
sync software enhancements allow
integrated graphics to run in tandem
with CUDA acceleration drastically
improving scrubbing features and a
render times speaking of which our last
content creation test revolves around
those render times here we expect clock
speed to play more of a role than raw
core count this is just the nature of
the program again so a five-minute 4k
video file in this case rendered using
the YouTube 4k preset places a 9900 K
just ahead of the 8700 K not far about a
30-second spread here the 2700 X there's
a fair job as well in this regard
despite its a lack of an IG P just
something to point out
the CPU is significantly cheaper than
its eight core blue team rival and this
is where well the remainder of the video
becomes rather pointless I mean I ran a
few 3d mark tests you can see here with
these CPUs as well as blender and
handbrake scenarios but they're meant to
do many things at once and yet no matter
how hard I tried I could not get the
9900 K to do anything the 8700 K and
2700 X couldn't I even opened 50 chrome
tabs all with YouTube videos playing the
background while streaming and gaming in
an attempt to stunt the lower tier CPUs
but no R 16 gigs of ram which should be
pretty obvious became the bottleneck
instead so what should you conclude then
from these tests right that the core I 9
is overpriced well yeah I mean we said
that in the beginning but even if we
assume an extremely conservative price
of say four hundred and fifty bucks for
this thing I still say it's overpriced
from precedent alone it should be no
more than $400 that's my opinion the
8700 K gave us two extra cores and 7700
K before it but we never paid 500 plus
USD here in the states I mean maybe for
a very short amount of time but it was
never permanent and this all ties back
in part to the supply shortage we
discussed in this video right here it
also ties into the fact that Intel's a
company with a large market share they
have their shareholders profit margins
and customers just like AMD though I'm
left questioning why this CPU even
exists in the first place so what was
Intel thinking well they were thinking
about money they were thinking about
their shareholders their profit margins
what we just said I mean like any other
company out there especially a company
that's public this is no different than
AMD I'm not trying to separate Intel
from AMD in this sense they're they're
all the same
AMD just looks to be a more consumer
friendly option right now because
they're not in a sense charging more
than they probably could or should for a
product you can blame the supply
shortage all you want but if Intel
really wanted to sell these things to
the masses they would price it much
lower than they currently are and they
would find ways to increase the supply
so that consumers could actually get
their hands on them and test them I'm
kind of surprised I even got one of
these especially now I mean you can't
find them but for a hundred bucks or so
from third-party sellers on sites like
Newegg so until knew that people were
gonna buy the cpu despite its 200 plus
watt power draw under
overclock low despite its toasty
temperatures even with just MCE enabled
and despite the fact that a beefier
motherboard would likely be needed for
any manual overclock they knew all the
stuff going into it they knew they would
probably still sell these well I think
they wish they had more supply to meet
the demand there's still a heavy demand
for the CPU despite what reviewers like
myself might tell you but I this is
definitely not my favorite CPU I
actually have a video again coming up
regarding my favorite Intel CPU already
did my favorite AMD CPU right here so
that video is coming soon but it is
obviously not the 9900 K it is too
expensive at this price I think it's too
expensive arguably at 450 bucks I think
it should be priced at 400 bucks or
slightly below that then it would make
sense in my eyes 8 cores really does
most people no good to be completely
honest 6 cores is kind of a sweet spot
right now
so the eighties 100 K is what I would
recommend are the 8086 K whichever one
is cheaper if again been fluctuating due
in part to the supply shortage but in a
nutshell my conclusion is this don't buy
the 9900 K buy something that's a little
more reasonable for the average user for
the typical consumer eight cores again
it's I think it ties a lot into the
marketing hype we promoted eight cores
with Rison but it was cheaper it was
significantly cheaper than 550 bucks
right now again for a small percentage
in frame rate bumps over the 8700 K
which was already the gaming keene so
that's my conclusion I kinda went off
script there but I wanted to give you
guys a little bit of a heart-to-heart at
the end of this one because you should
definitely be smart with your money in
this case and it's easy to say I want
the best of the best of the 9900 K is
what I'm gonna buy but you could be a
lot smarter with your purchase and see
next to no difference at all by choosing
to forgo the 9900 K for the 8700 K let's
say or even the 80 600 K or the 2700 X
to the 2700 or even the 2600 there are
so many options out there and frankly a
lot of them are much better purchase
choices purchase decisions than the 9900
K okay I'll stop rambling now let me
