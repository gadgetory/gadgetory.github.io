with an enthusiast grade punch as I and
many other reviewers have proven in our
official reviews of the 480 mine of
which you can check out right here this
card has the ability to keep up with the
mid-range fat cats of the last
generation namely the r9 390 and GTX 970
these two cards also cost approximately
100 US dollars more than AMD's newest
release at least here in the US so it's
safe to say then that AMD had the word
of budget in mind when they were
creating the RX 480
but how far can we stretch that word in
terms of PC components that we pair the
card with does this mean that we can
pair the card with an ultra cheap ultra
old PC and expect similar frame rates
well in short the answer is no old CPUs
will always be a bottleneck in some
fashion some just more than others so
that being said then how does a $350 PC
sound or to make things a little clearer
how do the $350 PC sound in which the
graphics card accounts for two-thirds of
the total price now we're getting
somewhere that's exactly what I've been
working on the entire weekend here in
the studio I found cheap parts on
craigslist and ebay to throw into this
rig and was able to keep the price
within console range this should be good
now I'm not going to start a whole PC
verse console fanboy battle whatever you
want to call it I've already tried to do
that the past and at this point it's
just not worth it but keeping the price
around 350 bucks allows those who
already prefer personal computers over
consoles to reconsider they'll end up
with a new graphics card and well a
not-so-new cpu speaking of which let's
jump into the parts I used first up is
the Foxconn a 78 ax Series am 2 plus
motherboard yes Foxconn not a brand you
generally think of when you think of a
new PC but that's probably because they
only offer a single motherboard
currently this supports the LGA 1151
chipset nei their skill set rests with
older equipment when the OEM was
thriving on the demand for motherboards
in the mid 2000s this thing's a perfect
blend of old and modern I guess you
could say offering plenty of SATA ports
PCI expansion slots and IDE interface
for old-school hard disk drives and
optical drives and even a floppy drive
port if you really want to get kinky
with it the a 78 ax also offers plenty
of rear i/o support including 5.1
channel audio something I was honestly
surprised Foxconn threw into this board
the heart of this build is the athlon x4
635 a quad-core CPU made in 2010 and
based on 45 nanometer architecture it
was originally designed for the am-3
socket but is backwards compatible with
a m2 plus motherboards as long as the
BIOS is up-to-date and ours is with our
Foxconn Board the chip itself looks
identical to the FX series lineup with
the pins on the processor rather than
the motherboard this is a trend AMD has
been following for quite some time to
cool the CPU will be using one that
looks very similar to Andy's new wraith
cooler actually although this one's much
much louder it kept a little Athlon
below 50 C for pretty much of the
duration of my test to my surprise
though the clock speed on the chip
admittedly wasn't high i over clocked
this chip to 3.2 gigahertz from its 2.9
stock frequency out of the box for some
reason the multiplier was locked in this
particular BIOS but I was able to
overclock using the base clock method
which was just fine for RAM I've got two
sticks of low profile ddr2 clock to 800
megahertz for a total of 4 gigabytes
running a dual channel these DIMMs are
also known as VOP modules VLP standing
for very low profile under most
circumstances I would elect for at least
8 gigabytes of RAM in a gaming PC but
being that this is an old computer and
that I got this thing on the cheap 4
gigabytes should be just fine we'll be
cutting it close but for spine all three
of these components by the way
the motherboard the CPU and RAM cost me
$60 in total thanks to a gentleman I
found on Craigslist here locally in
Florida so if you're watching this video
I appreciate your business these
processors alone sell for upwards of 40
to 50 bucks on eBay a bit overpriced if
I do say so myself
so he definitely hooked us up the
graphics card I used is of course the 8
gigabyte AMD R X 480
however thanks to some recent power
issues with this card and this card only
the 92 TI work just fine with the
Foxconn motherboard I've decided to
undervolt the card to reduce the amount
of stress exerted on the PCIe slot but
don't worry I cover this issue in much
more detail right here the graphics card
requires a single 6 pin power connector
and that's exactly what this 400 watt
power supply is equipped with while AMD
does technically recommend a 500 watt
power supply be paired with this card
we're going to be just fine using a 400
watt these are just suggestions made by
the company to make sure that there's
not a shadow of a doubt that your power
supply is not working properly or you
know causing your computer to be
unstable so they say 500 odds because
well there's definitely no chance of 504
our case there's no chance at 400 either
trust me the math works out just fine
for storage I threw in a 320 gigabyte
7200 rpm hard disk drive from Seagate
which I obtained for free actually
although for the sake of this video we
will regard it as a $20.00 unit this
system doesn't have any fans mounted to
the case I reused from an old build the
Thermaltake vs. v3 AMD black edition but
our temperature under loads stayed
within their limits so I didn't bother
adding anything else to the budget the
CPU fan is also blowing towards the
motherboard which should provide
adequate cooling for the V RMS and large
capacitors if you do plan on building a
computer similar to this one however I
recommend that you try your best to
incorporate at least one fan subtle
airflow is better than no airflow oh and
one more thing I kind of misplaced the
power button on the tower itself which
means that powering the sucker on at
least for the time being requires a jump
of to physical pins on the board itself
how are a spring-loaded switch with
something like aluminum should be enough
where fix in the near future but I'm not
worried about that at this point because
I'm not worried about selling it at this
point I installed Windows 10 64 bit
without any issues as well as the most
recent Crimson drivers for the RX 480 oh
and I forgot to mention my WD black one
terabyte hard drive was thrown in
temporarily so that I could run all the
required gaming
benchmarks I was not about to redownload
all of those games speaking of which
let's find out how well this thing
stacks up for $350 first up instead of
bench we get a feel for just how
powerful this quad-core CPU is both of
these are overclocked by the way this
one 23.2 gigahertz and this one two four
point six and a 250 7cb
it's okay keep in mind that this 635 is
six years old as of 2016 and with
respect to the 6700 K it's not all that
bad a performer Geekbench tells us much
of the same while it's single core score
is lagging behind 1570 the multi-core
score is actually decent thanks to the
four cores on board let's see how this
translate to frame rates in games how
much of a bottleneck with this athlon x4
635 B let's start things off with Grand
Theft Auto 5 which introduces a blend of
both CPU and GPU intensive scenes
frankly to my surprise the Athlon how to
better than I thought it would check
this out while running everything at
either Ultra or very high the maximum
presets for all the settings in the
regular settings tab the exceptions
being anti-aliasing and ambient
occlusion the PC managed a hefty 47
frames per second on the average with
minimums dipping just slightly below
what I would call the bare minimum 30
frames per second for gaming but no
grade we want to see 60 frames per
second not 30 where PC gamers not
console gamers whoops did I offend
anybody Perry there are plenty of ps4
Xbox one games the run of 60fps true
there are but I guarantee you they
aren't running at the most optimal
settings compromises had to be made and
the case is no different here turning
everything down to normal in the
Settings tab resulted in a huge
framerate gain across the board I mean
if you don't look anywhere else in this
graph check out the minimum frame rates
what 51 that's better than my $1200
gaming and editing rig and max settings
very impressive this Athlon 635 and rx
40 combo is but is this the case across
all titles in short No let's check out
City skylines a very CPU intensive game
by all means running everything at max
settings yields undeniably pitiful frame
rates this is what we call in the PC
gaming sphere unplayable I actually
recorded a bit of this with my camera as
well since using an onboard screen
recorder dropped these frame rates to
near zero it was that bad the stuttering
intensified the closer I zoomed in
emphasizing the lack of CPU horsepower
we had that was required to run this
game at any desirable framerate reducing
the in game settings brought the game to
life again but only barely arm in
máximos more bad but the average frame
rate still hovered much closer to the
minimum meaning that this game was still
relatively unstable another
cpu-intensive title is total war
Warhammer things get especially taxing
on the CPU when the battles get
especially intense and much like city
skylines zooming and makes everything
much worse
our average frame rate and maximum
settings - anti-aliasing was a whopping
36.6 which isn't all that far off from
our i7 6700 k's average although the
minimums and maximums were both much
lower I mean come on 11 frames per
second and this wasn't the only time
that the frame rate to dip this low it
was a frequent occurrence actually
almost similar to stuttering as a result
of a bad internet connection I'm sure
most of us know what that feels like I
imagine our 4 gigabytes of RAM was also
slightly limiting to be fair in this
regard but being as though most of this
game relies on video memory the CPU is
still likely the culprit I would like to
point out however that lowering the
settings bump these minimums quite a bit
giving the game what I would call at
least an enjoyable experience because in
a game like this 40 frames per second is
actually manageable I would say in a
first-person shooter or something like a
racing game you would want more than 40
something like 60 70 something around
there hitman was a title I expected much
more fun with this rig however I
experienced much of the same about half
the framerate I received with the rx 480
in my i7 rig I honestly expected the RX
40 to exceed my expectations in this
game being that it was kind of designed
around this platform but across the
board the minimums were just
disappointing I should also note that
DirectX 12 was a no-go with this machine
for reasons unknown the DirectX 12
preset and supporting titles always
resulted in a crash about halfway
through each benchmark disappointing to
say the least and I think we have the
Athlon to blame
rise of the Tomb Raider also running in
dx11 was a mixed bag while the averages
stayed well above 30 I experienced
infrequent dips - I'm talking about
three fps the game would run smoothly
pause for a split second and then
continue running smoothly a bit strange
and a bit annoying but overall still
playable I suppose dropping the Settings
reduced the framerate dips but not to a
substantial enough amount in my personal
opinion to justify the compromising
graphical clarity the last game I tested
was ashes of the singularity now for a
few initial start ups the game crashed
if I liked the intro video play all the
way through this never happened for some
odd reason but if I skipped ahead to the
menu screen the game would crash before
the benchmark even started when the game
did decide to not miss
with the system basically the same story
emerged about half the frame rates of
the i7 obtained across the board and
check this out 9.8 frames per second on
the heavy section so with all that said
I hope that if you take anything away
from this video it's that the RX 480
while budget-minded in its own right is
not meant to be paired with a mediocre
platform from several years ago so many
Triple A titles today rely on harmonious
blends of CPU and GPU horsepower and if
you have one but not the other
it'll be hit or miss for the most part
unless of course you plan on heavily
compromising on those in-game graphics
and in case you're wondering games like
csgo and dota 2 achieve very playable
frame rates with both averages topping
out at around 100 not bad for a super
cheap processor so while this computer
might not be able to play every triple-a
title in max settings it certainly held
its own when settings were turned down
at 1080p it's definitely a compromise
eye-opening for a platform of this
calibre but if you pair it with an RX
480
the card alone should be strong enough
to pull your frame rates along maybe not
to your desired amount but hey when you
compromise on PC components you should
also compromise on your expectations
even when the computer itself is paired
with a brand-new 8 gigabyte video card
from AMD if you like what you saw in
this video be sure to give this thing a
thumbs up give it a thumbs down if you
feel the complete opposite or if you
