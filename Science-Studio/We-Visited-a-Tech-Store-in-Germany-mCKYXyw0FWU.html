wondering where I've been for the
Christmas holidays I've been in Germany
I'm still here in Germany we are at for
the call tech market pick the most
generic name ever for a tech store but
that's where we are and I figured we'd
start things off with the graphics card
section because that tends to be the
best indicator of where prices are for
PC building enthusiasts so we'll start
first with the rx 570 here 329 euros
okay that is roughly just a direct
conversion there about what 380 400 USD
almost which is pretty darn high for 570
and this is only a four gig card we have
the GTX 1060 next to it for three
hundred and eight euro which is actually
a better deal just from a raw
performance standpoint they've 1060
slightly better it just on a frame rate
comparison also a six gig card so you're
getting the higher-end 1060 there from
ZOTAC for about 20 euro less which is
pretty cool down here we have an RX 570
again this is another four gig model 279
euro okay I'm not sure why gigabytes
models so much more expensive than
sapphires but this would be the one I
would recommend in that case okay this
is the RX 580 also from sapphire for 399
euro didn't get in pretty pricey this is
like gtx 1070 1070 TI territory in the
states and you're only getting a 580
there so prices are pretty high and I'm
sure most of you who live in Europe
already know that now on NVIDIA side gtx
1070 this is an asus course a gig car
there all you get cards this is for 33
euro and you can pair that of the 580
which is not as good a car this is
actually a pretty good deal we're
looking at around 490 to 500 euro I'm
just kind of just doing these in my head
but that's not too bad considering we
are in Germany next to that we have the
GTX 1080 turbo blower style card from a
soos this is a $560 card euro looking at
over 600 bucks us that's pretty
expensive for a blower style 1080 you're
looking at roughly 1080i performance
equivalently in the space for way to be
paying so if you live in this
States especially you know that RAM
prices right now are extremely high
they're working on the new fabrication
notes and new processes for memory so
the old stuff is basically just not in
supply very much and that's why prices
are pretty high for RAM it's interesting
though in this store at least an 8 gig
stick of ddr4 granted only running at 20
40 megahertz only costs according to
this tag here $49.99 euro when you
convert that that's about 50 60 bucks
u.s. but but that's still actually a
pretty good price this stick here we
just pull it up on like Newegg Ramazan
costs a bit more so RAM is actually
cheaper in Europe than it is in the
United States even though the supply
from Korea and elsewhere is the say I
mean it's all coming from the same place
so I don't know what that's about
interesting though so keyboards are
pretty expensive here hundred 80 euro
for a chroma BlackWidow v2 these are
what Razer green switches they have
their own switched brands but there are
similar to Browns and blues these are
the orange switches this one's actually
missing a key cap so if someone took off
with looks like the - key good game all
right and for console lovers out there I
actually just bought a ps4 pro myself
this one is bundled with it looks like
beef 18 you get some extra perks
involved with that game but this is
priced at 400 euro this is equivalent
almost to what it costs in the States
but of course you have the conversion
factor to take into account here so this
is gonna be about 450 ish US dollars not
too bad it's great to see console prices
aren't overinflated by any substantial
amount here and if we pan on over to the
Xbox one X's that they have I don't know
what the prices are on these I'm sure
they're a bit more what do we have here
$4.99 that's that's that's about right
that's about what I'd expect it to be
and it doesn't look over getting a
bundle here ya know bundle but isn't
that crazy six teraflops of
floating-point performance now that's
not you can't just directly convert that
you know from console to PC to another
PC it's all relative but still
incredible compute power for a console
like this I take it back you can get pub
G bundled with your 499 euro Xbox one X
purchase so chicken dinner and get
yourself some chicken dinner
right here all right we are here in the
waffle maker section because we
definitely need to get one for hope
let's see we have different sizes we can
have big waffles waffle shaped like a
flower nobody our mini hard we want to
have this mini Horry
this is an entire aisle of what do you
guys call them platen dealers license
peelers basically like electronic DJ
setups I've never seen this many DJ
setups an electronic store in my life
kind of cool TV prices always really
sketchy difficult to compare especially
across countries because there are
several models and many of them share
exactly the same specs and at different
times in the year you can get there from
really cheap
I got a 55 inch LG 4k TV non OLED but a
good enough thing was a VA panel for
like 550 u.s. dollars it's around 450
500 euro I'm not really going to try to
compare these TV prices to that one but
this one here I think is their most
expensive TV they have in the store
twenty thousand euros for a 77 inch
this better be 8k nope only a 4k TV that
is incredible
my GoPros are an interesting commodity
to compare across country so GoPro
purifiers are gonna cost around 330 euro
that's for a GoPro Hero 5 black which is
a 4k 30fps action camera of course
everyone knows GoPro now the gopro hero
6 which is most notably known for its 4k
60fps capabilities cost about five
hundred and thirty euros which is about
thirty thirty euros more than the
equivalent US dollar price of $4.99
that's not too bad at all actually let's
say 1500 vs. 1300 what am i what am i
what am i seeing different here okay you
want the 4k display it's another 200
euro so not bad the people in Europe say
bucks ever liked it all I didn't think
so okay they're gonna make fun of me in
this video an lg monitor these the
analogy ultra wide there are actually
really great values I started out with
one of these that I had the 29 um 57
this is a 58 here but this is a 2560 by
1080p panel and that comes up to roughly
29 inches
which is about 74 centimeters this is a
great this is a great value monitor
still 275 euro not the greatest deal
here at least but in the states you can
pick these up for dirt cheap we're
talking in certain in certain scenarios
under 200 USD if you find one for under
two and USD and you're not concerned
about anything higher than you know
ultra wide 1080p then get yourself one
of these trust me I used one for a long
time they're great monitors okay a bit
of a shame here we just realized that
they don't have refresh rates listed for
any of these monitors this is a gaming
monitor from Asus the PG 25 8 Q which I
know III it's either a 144 Hertz or a
240 Hertz panel it's only 1080p so it's
likely at a high refresh rate 240 Hertz
panel g-sync
all the goodies included for 500 euro
but again you wouldn't know any of that
just by looking at the tag because all
you see here is the diagonal length and
then you see the the pixel of the
resolution and me for whatever reason
the aspect ratio because that's super
important I guess
well we do know the refresh rate of one
of these monitors because it's actually
like engraved on the frame that's pretty
funny
so this is an AOC monitor 144 Hertz
1080p panel looks like a TN yep so TN
panel and 1080p for 245 euro not too bad
but you could find better more than
likely in the States
alright for those Apple buffs out there
looking at eleven hundred and fifty euro
for the 64 gig Space Gray iPhone 10 if
you want the 256 gig variant you're
looking at about 300 or excuse me
thirteen hundred and twenty euro that is
if you convert currencies about a three
to four hundred dollar markup just
because you're in Europe that's a bit
outrageous you're looking at 900 euro
for an iPhone 8 + 64 gig model you want
just an iPhone 7 base model here 32 gigs
of storage looking at about 630 euro I
still pretty darn high for a phone
that's a gen old iPhone 6 is what 379
that's interesting like they were only
selling the 32 gig model and then if you
want an iPhone se for whatever reason
350 euro for the 32 gig model I'm
actually still sporting an se kind of
halfway sporting one I saw between that
and LGV 30 but still good phone if you
like the small
form-factor so with the release of
Intel's newest I'm gonna calling it
cable a car I'm not mistaken it's
basically the 8000 series ultra-low
power processors so the i7s have four
core hyper threaded CPUs which is pretty
sweet for ultra-low power
CPUs and the tvp's I think is exactly
the same I haven't yet reviewed one but
it's nice to see these in stock they are
a bit pricey I would say these are about
two to five hundred euro more than their
US counterparts but the fact that you
can buy them it's pretty sweet
some of these actually have dedicated
like 940 MX NVIDIA GPUs it's just pretty
sweet good for on-the-go video rendering
and the like one PC I'm really
interested in testing this one right
here from Asus it looks almost identical
to the Dell XPS 13 at least with that
infinity display it's got literally no
bezel and costs about 950 euro only
sporting the 7000 series i5 so 2 cores
and hyper-threaded but still it looks
pretty nice you know I used to think
tablets were super cool that was when I
was in high school actually just
graduating high school my senior year I
thought tablets were super cool I think
I bought one it was an old Nexus 7
tablet and a really nice stock Android
experience I ended up selling the thing
after like three months because I just
didn't use it but really anything phones
do most of what tablets can do and if
you want something that's much bigger
than a phone in terms of real estate you
know screen wise then buy yourself a
laptop because you do a lot more with it
in my opinion all right now there's
always the question of prebuilt s--
whether or not you're paying a hefty
premium to have the pc pre-built for you
with Windows 10 or you know whatever
operating system already installed so
this is an i-5 7400 processor one
terabyte hard disk drive and that's it
eight gigs of RAM I know we have a 256gb
SSD now gtx 1060 not sure if it's the
three or six gig variant will assume
three because it's usually the worst of
the two and of course Windows 10 looking
at a thousand and 99 euros about a
thousand euros if you wanted to build
one yourself of course though you don't
get you know the
demise ability when you purchase
pre-built but you're looking at about
$100 markup which isn't too bad honestly
for or pre-built here in Germany
alright always interesting to check out
text stores especially when we're in
other countries this is the first like
text or review slash walkthrough we've
done in a different country I think so
thanks Germany for hosting us thanks
Lisa for hosting me and for holding the
camera this entire time there's a really
weird country song playing in the
background you guys listen the country
here so anyway thanks for watching we
will be uploading regular content here
again soon when we're back in Florida
until next time this is science studio
thanks for traveling with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
