three as in if you haven't seen part one
and two yet what the heck are you doing
on part three go ahead and check out
parts one and two in the cards above me
now let's get to it I promised you all a
great deal of half-life coverage because
you grilled me for not including it in
part two so here it goes
and ok I know it was released on Windows
in 1998 which is actually two years
outside of our timeline but that's
besides the point
half-life was a huge success by November
2004 the game had sold over 8 million
copies and was making its rounds in
early consoles as well its unique
gameplay consisted of uninterrupted
cutscenes making for a full-fledged
first-person experience the overwhelming
support for third-party modifications
the original game is what eventually led
to the creation of counter-strike which
I discussed in part 2 in the year 2000
the turn of the millennium The Sims was
released for the PC I still have my
original copy of the game minimum
requirements were a CP with a clock
speed of at least 233 mega Hertz I mean
come on
32 megabytes of RAM that's megabytes not
gigabytes and a video core with at least
2 megabytes of dedicated memory Wow I
apologize to anyone this may offend in
advance but I cannot go through the year
2001 without mentioning the beta version
of runescape which manifested itself
into pay to play and free-to-play
variants by March 29th its quote-unquote
official release date this one I'll
admit hits close to home I grew up
playing this when the game window was
only 40 percent of the total screen real
estate it carried a unique medieval
esque aura and was role-playing which I
mean come on it's role-playing people
could level up individual skills roam
the world and complete quests and
customize their characters to their
liking I'm using past tense here because
runescape 3 the third implementation of
runescape is just old-school is where
it's at the Medal of Honor franchise
made its PC debut in 2002 with the
introduction of allied assault
critically acclaimed for its accurate
and breathtaking renditions of Omaha
Beach and other battle sites in both
France and Germany during world war ii
the online multiplayer experience was
also a great one's game modes such as
Deathmatch and capture the flag were
among the favorites Serious Sam also
peaked in popularity by this time with
the first encounter from oh one and the
second encounter of o2 resulting in
various console ports in later years
Serious Sam was a personal favorite of
mine because the storyline was just
weird and the guns were freakin awesome
rollercoaster tycoon 2 the successful
offspring of our
gt1 was also released in o2 and well i
shouldnt have to explain this one it's a
great game a great game he builds
rollercoasters and tire parks and then
you know blow things up I said I'd
mention it when the time came so here it
is SimCity for making its rounds in 2003
this city-building game featured a 3d
engine and endless creative
possibilities allowing for the user to
scope landscapes zone and develop
residential commercial and industrial
complexes create massive sometimes
thriving cities and end it all with just
a few clicks I'm talking volcanoes
earthquakes tornadoes Armageddon you get
the point 2003 also marked the birth of
grand theft auto vice city for the PC
and proved to be one of the most
successful GTA releases to date the free
roam possibilities unique 80s music and
riveting and also culturally accurate
storyline set by city apart from other
games on both the PC and console
platforms ok 2004 quite a lot happened
during this year we had games like doom
3 half-life 2 Unreal Tournament Need for
Speed Underground 2 The Sims 2
counter-strike source and Far Cry all
hit the shelves during the same time I'm
sure most of you have played most of
these at some point so I'm not gonna
bother stating the obvious but what I
will do is elaborate briefly on World of
Warcraft which was released on November
23rd for Australia North America and
February 11th the following year for
much of Europe like runescape World of
Warcraft is an MMORPG
or a massive multiplayer online
role-playing game I'm sure many of you
are offended because I just compared
those two games but just bear with me
here
players could ultimately control the
fates of their own characters submerse
in a world surrounded by other online
players while the game had a defined
storyline of sorts it invited players to
think outside the box and develop
various skills through unique
user-defined means that goes without
saying wow remains a very popular game
even today grand theft auto san andreas
was released for Windows in 2005 as was
quake 4 which was based on the doom 3
game engine from the previous year Tom
Clancy's Rainbow six lockdown hit the
shelves in 2006 and marked the first
installment of the Rainbow six series
typical of Clancy's video games the user
can control individual characters apart
from their own through each level a cool
point here is that much of what was
removed from the console version of the
game released a year prior was
reimplemented into the PC version good
game consoles good game Just Cause was
also released during this year which
would soon lead to the development of
Just Cause 2 in 2010 and just cost three
by the end of
2015 PC gaming icons The Witcher in
BioShock were released into the PC 2007
as was Resident Evil 4 finally ported
all three of which were very successful
across multiple platforms but can it run
in Crysis the term coined after the
rigorous Crysis released in the same
year marked a significant demand for
extra personal computer horsepower at
this point game graphics were taking off
and hardware at the same time struggled
to keep the frame rates above acceptable
limits
fallout 3 minutes first appearance in
2008 as did left 4 dead watch out for
the tank and GTA 4 that game was just
great Dead Space was also released
during October of this year for the PC
in which the player controlling Isaac
Clarke battles hordes of Necromorphs
this one was quite scary and no doubt
about it
the year 2009 was all about league of
legends the famous battle arena summoner
experience still played by many today
and minecraft the free world sandbox
with endless possibilities in sight
while the official release didn't happen
until 2011 the classic version struck
the interest of many developers leading
to the development of mojang by
minecraft creator Markus Persson in the
same year I should also note that the
popular games of the sims 3 and Batman
Arkham Asylum were released in 2009 as
well while these games attracted
entirely different audiences both were
critically acclaimed Arkham Asylum for
its epic storyline and The Sims 3 for
its furniture and stuff no I'm just
kidding I played Sims 3 ok we're getting
very close to the present time 2010
marked the release of several tubes
Just Cause 2 Bioshock 2 Dead Rising 2
and Mass Effect 2 all of which were very
successful sequels and I suppose
prequels to the 3rd iterations of each
of their series series is ooh that ain't
that ain't right
Fallout New Vegas and Sid Meier's if I
were also epic releases therein this
year mind you but they didn't end in 2
so you know that just that wouldn't have
worked out but I have played both and as
a result I am big fans of though we're
getting awfully close to modern triple-a
titles folks but I'm gonna save those
for part 4 because that's a lot to cover
in such a short amount of time
if you did enjoy part 4 be sure to give
the video a thumbs up check outs part 1
&amp;amp; 2 if you haven't already and you just
completely ignore by sudden beginning of
the video you're still watching this one
for whatever reason give the video a
thumbs down if you feel the complete
opposite or if you hate everything about
life and stay tuned for that really old
AMD PC video aka the potato that I'll be
showing and uploading very soon this is
