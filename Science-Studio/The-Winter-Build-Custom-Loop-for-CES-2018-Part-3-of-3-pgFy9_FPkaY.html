I mean really air bubbles are basically
out of here the rad might have a few air
bubbles but you can kind of flip the
case back and forth and get those out
and pushed into the reservoir we need to
add one more thing to the system and
that is some team group nighthawk or GB
ddr4 these are white dims just like the
ones we already have in the system we
have two on that side so we're gonna add
two more on this side to complete the
build
don't worry that systems not on just the
pump because we jumped the 24-pin so
this is not unsafe there we go
all right everyone I'm gonna make this
outro short and quick I have to pack
this thing up and ship it to day because
I leave for Germany tomorrow and I don't
have any other time of the year to ship
this to Vegas so I'm going to be doing
that now I guess I'll just show an up
short clip of me draining the fluid if
any of you were into that sort of thing
but I think the build looks really good
this is probably I know I say this
probably in every bill but this is this
is one of my best builds to date I think
that the color scheme the fact that it's
just all white neutral white is really
unique you don't see too many builds
that are basically all white except for
the radiator I didn't paint the red
mainly because I didn't have time but
even so I'm okay with having this up
front it's not like in the middle of the
build so it doesn't unbalanced anything
and there are black accents other in
other places in the case so I'm not
really gonna complain I think the fans
look great Chris did an excellent job
painting those we can't see the painted
PSU but the shroud looks great from the
Sun I think it just makes everything
look really cohesive and the RAM of
course from Team Group looks stunning
not sure how many of you are aware of
this but in the dark Bass Pro 900 you
just open this little front panel here
and you have a little toggle so you can
not only speed up the fans that are
plugged directly into the fan hub at the
back of the case which also acts as an
LED switch of sorts you can also do just
that switch the LEDs so we can stick
with white or we can go red or we can go
green blue this is like a orange yellow
I guess or you can just turn them off so
it's nice to have that versatility there
and you do get an LED strip included
with your purchase of the dark base Pro
900 whether you get the white edition or
the regular black one so that's it folks
by the way the graphics card is coming
in after I shipped this I'm just gonna
have it shipped it to the office and
then I'm gonna take it with me to Vegas
because it's not being water-cooled I
can just you know plug and play and I do
have a riser cable from Thermaltake here
so I'm not pointing the camera in the
right direction so that we can have it
all hooked up now I don't have a drive
in here because this is literally a show
build so if they want to actually like
show anything on screen they're going to
give me a hard drive or an SSD but you
know it runs fine as is it just won't
boot into an operating system it's all
you need for a show build anyway if you
like this video be sure to give it a
thumbs up I appreciate that thumbs down
for the opposite click subscribe and
stay tuned for more builds like these on
Channel and our CES coverage coming
January 8th or 9th somewhere around then
this is science studio thanks for
building with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
