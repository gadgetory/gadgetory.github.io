below me right here is a Sony
PlayStation there is no number after
this model because well this was the
first model that Sony ever released of
the PlayStation series this has been
owned by my family for about 15 or 16
years I might be completely wrong about
that but I remember having this thing
when I was very very young and I used to
play games on this all the time this was
the first console I ever played that I
can remember and it served my childhood
very well so what we're going to do now
that it's basically been sitting in a
box for a long time is tear it down and
we're going to see what was inside of
this very old but very cool first gen
Sony Playstation there's something in
here that like rattles I have no idea
what that is so maybe we'll find out
when we actually start tearing it down
so the outside first off is where we'll
start with the teardown process
obviously there's nothing on the top
here that we can unscrew but I do want
to give you a quick rundown of what it
was like to own one of these things and
basically the versatility of such a I
don't know I guess rather slim form
factor I mean think about it for the
time even though the games that this
console would run we're not very
intensive you know in today's standards
they actually were back then and so to
have a console so slim and so small it
was quite impressive for its time you
can see here we have an open button all
this does here is pop open the CD tray
this kind of reminds me of those
old-school CD players you know you lift
the little flap and then insert your
little cd-rom and yeah that's basically
what that is so you can see it's just
mechanical
it's really all it happens there so this
lid kind of pops up just plastic this is
the power button you would push this and
it would turn on and then I push it
again it would turn off it does seem to
have like a little spring loader in
there and then a reset button which I
don't ever remember using but I guess
this would be this would be a useful
tool if you ever had games freeze up on
you which the ps1
was notorious for so that's it for the
top really pretty cool there on the
front here you've got to memory card
slots these memory cards we're not very
big at all leave the the largest that we
ever owned was a 512 kilobyte memory
card and really that's all you need I
think it's all it's going to do is just
load a save point from the game so the
city would do much of the loading the
memory card would just tell the CD where
to start from
and then you have these very ancient
controller inputs so original
controllers did not have the joysticks a
little analogues on either side you
could play with but these did support
those and we're offered later on after
the console was released besides here
nothing entertaining both sides were
kind of the same see nothing special
dude really yeah you're welcome on the
back here see we have a parallel power
out nobody really used that same with a
serial power out nobody use that that I
knew of the main one here that you would
use for display well it's really only
one you can use with the AV multi-out
so this is what you would plug from here
into a TV a cable would feed from this
side to and then like this so you would
have your video which was yellow and
then you would have your left and right
audio inputs which would be like its
outputs the red and white wow that's
like really dirty that's really nasty
anyway these are very old the whole
thing's very old so I'm not sure how
disgusting this thing will look when we
actually start tearing it down
but that's what we're about to do so
this is all fresh I've never actually
done this before for some reason one of
the screws is like very lifted I don't
know why I never tried to take this
thing apart earlier but as far as I know
of this one is - that's really weird I
don't know we're going to tear it down
anyway it's the first things first we're
going to pop off these screws here on
the bottom of the console like I said I
don't know why these look like they've
been removed already they weren't
screwed in properly if they were removed
I don't know why why that's the case
give these nice little handy arrows here
that are yes pointing to the rather
obvious screw
I don't know why why they were to even
bother doing that
okay maybe I should've done this from
the other side one second
okay so this is basically just the
entire top of the frame of the console
just comes right off you can see the
levers here how they work kind of kind
of cool just spring-loaded their power
button was literally just a piece of
plastic that pushed a button actually on
the board up here and then same with the
reset button just another plastic piece
I would push a button literally on the
board itself this is an important piece
to the console obviously this is what
would rotate the CD and this laser right
here is what would read the CD so I
believe the maximum amount of data
allowed on a Playstation CD was 660
megabytes so this laser was in charge of
moving up and down as this disc rotated
and as all that occurred the laser was
basically reading the data on the disk
and sending it through this cable right
here I believe that this cable is just
for the motor so this is what's going to
rotate the disc there are four cables
here so two of them are going to be for
power one's going to be for ground
regulation and the other one's probably
going to be kind of like a PWM
controller on like a standard computer
it would tell the motor how fast to turn
so that's what I'm assuming those four
cables of for we're going to go ahead
and pull these apart cool things about
these cables here they just pop right
off the board so this is the entire
reading unit of the original PlayStation
nothing special really now but for its
time it was state of the art I'm going
to put that to the side so just as a
safety precaution I know this thing has
like literally not been turned on for I
would say ten years I'm going to hold
the power button down
I advise doing this with anything that
you take apart that involves a power
supply and/or transformer so I hold this
down for about five or ten seconds this
will let all of the power drain
out of any of the large capacitors it
might be on the circuit board that
you'll be working with so essentially
this entire board right here it's
completely independent of the issue
you'd call it motherboard which is where
the CPU and GPU house this entire board
was in charge of power regulations you
can see on the back here this is where
powered run into your console from a
wall and then this entire board would be
in charge of basically downgrading the
power to its specified amounts and then
these five cables right here were in
charge of delivering power from this
board ultimately from the wall to the
motherboard so the CPU and the GPU all
of your controller units your memory
cards your lasers and your CD motor
would all be powered from just these
five little wires right here that's
pretty cool you don't see that nowadays
this little cable I unplugged here is in
charge of memory card power allocation
memory card data reading and also your
controller so any controller feedback
that you wanted sent to the console
would have to run through this little
flat cable here and there are actually
only it looks like ten pins so really
for for what you're inputting here you
know downgrading that down to just ten
pins of the data streams actually quite
impressive so we're going to go ahead
and see if we can lift this entire panel
off now I believe I've taken off all the
screws
so this is just a big I guess you could
call it a heat shield it's just a piece
of metal it's actually yeah it's it's
it's kind of aluminum I'm assuming and
it just protects the entire motherboard
so what we have now are just pieces of
copper just a thin copper paper and then
over here it's a more reflective metal
I'm also assuming that that is aluminum
it looks like aluminum so maybe you guys
know what that is but I think it's a
little bit unsure does it look like
aluminum and this plate is actually Wow
it's actually soldered to the
motherboard itself this plate will not
come up without using a soldering kit
okay so that just folds right up that's
that's nice this aluminum plate like I
said here this is not going to fold up
this is soldered literally to the
motherboard unfortunately that's going
to hide the CPU and the GPU in this case
so a lot of these fancy looking chips
here are in charge of things like audio
they did have an independent audio
processor on here so similar to like a
GP or a CPU they had something similar
to like an SPU so a sound processing
unit yeah but some of these chips are
allocated specifically for so a couple
of cool facts about the central
processing unit of the original
PlayStation this processing unit only
had five kilobytes that's right this
with a K not an M five kilobytes of l1
cache so most impede a utilize
processors that have I don't know grades
of l2 and l3 cache but they're always
typically in 512 kilobytes to one or two
or three or four megabytes of data
allocation each the CPU here carried
32-bit architecture and was running at a
frequency of 33 roughly 33 megahertz
33 yeah if you're running like a 95 90
right now by AMD you're probably up at
around 5 gigahertz if you're running
like a low-power z
III let's say you're probably running at
2.6 or 2.3 gigahertz but most CPUs
whether they demand a lot of power or
little run at some gigahertz frequency
and this one was only running at 33
megahertz so this thing only had two
megabytes of RAM to access so that's
basically the memory that the CPU would
directly communicate with and it only
had two megabytes of it so most
computers nowadays would require at
least two gigabytes of them I believe to
run Windows 10 you need like 1.5 2
gigabytes of ddr2 or DDR whatever DDR
you're running but in this case this low
power low frequency CPU only required 2
megabytes of just regular old DRAM the
GPU which Sony manufactured was also
based on 32-bit architecture it only
packed one megabyte of VRAM most
graphics cards today require 2 gigabytes
of vram that's gigabytes with a G it's a
GB but in this case the GPU is only
sporting 1 megabyte of VRAM a lot of
power the GPU also had an adjustable
frame buffer flat shading and texture
mapping this or Z would still probably
see in the specifications of graphics
cards today now the video out over here
was capable of displaying over 16
million colors on whatever screen
decided to plug this thing into and also
featured an interlaced 640 by 480
resolution I don't advise doing this by
the way I do not advise doing this on
any new circuit board because you're
going to like blow and then you're gonna
have some like spit fly out of your
mouth and you're probably going to
short-circuit something but in this case
should be ok even if something does
happen old it's very old
so hey would you look at that it
actually works I was not expecting it to
to be completely honest but I still
wanted to show show everyone what it
would be like to have one not work the
fact that it did is very impressive now
I did make some sounds I don't know if
you could hear I was just using my
camera's built-in microphone so this
sound is probably not the greatest but
if you couldn't hear it it was making
some odd sounds when the console first
started up it would start spinning the
disc and then it would make some loud
almost like grinding noises I think that
has to do with the motor that there
aren't any other moving parts in the
system there's no internal cooling fan
or anything like that so the only thing
that I think could make that noise is
the motor and it might just be a bad
motor in there and the audio was kind of
a problem it would just be in and out
but there wasn't any static or anything
like that so I'd say that the sound
issue was probably just a driver issue
something they're not going to update
obviously but the fact that the game
actually ran and was playable was quite
cool and it was it was nice to kind of
jump back into the ring and play some
old Frogger some old-school Frogger
ain't nothing wrong with that
so if you want to see more like this let
me know I'll see what I can get my hands
on and we'll do some more of these tear
downs slash reviews slash spec overviews
slash test runs see if we can get these
systems to run like the visit this one
here so that's about it everyone we
appreciate you checking out our first
ever console review slash teardown slash
whatever thought the video was cool just
um ZUP got videos crap give thumbs down
should subscribe there's more than just
this kind of stuff on our site be sure
to check out our astronomy videos our
geology videos especially our computer
videos which are pretty hot right now we
appreciate the support on all of those
and we will continue to bring more
quality entertainment from everyone here
at science studio thanks for learning
with us
I'm gonna play some more Frogger</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
