regarding DL SS which stands for deep
learning super sampling there's a
science to do thanks for learning with
us okay but seriously why so much
commotion what exactly about DL SS makes
it so important for RTX graphics cards
well it'll be easier to break this one
down a component by component basis will
open a minute science super sampling the
second half of that acronym is just a
fancy term for scaling a game to a
resolution beyond what your monitor
supports so for example in GTA 5 I can
enable frame scaling that's just another
term for super sampling and to run a
resolution that is twice the density of
my 1440p gaming panel in this case
that's five thousand one hundred and
twenty by twenty eight eighty pixels but
why would I want to scale a resolution
beyond what I'll actually end up seeing
on screen right I can't change my
screens resolution less like completely
swap monitors so why would I do that
a few reasons actually the biggest is
because frame scaling can smooth out to
a degree sharp edges similar to how
anti-aliasing works so since pixels are
squares around and diagonal edges can
look choppy a bit like stairs and super
sampling can in some cases smooth them
out though I'd almost always advise
enabling a a for a similar effect
instead since it tends to have less of
an impact on the average frame rate so
that's what super sampling is I discuss
it more in this video here but what
about the deep learning part of DL SS
why is that important and why is it
necessary for ray tracing well to start
all deep learning really means it's
basically marketing jargon at this point
because a lot of people use it that an
AI is that something in the background
is improving with time it's studying a
pattern repetition it's trying to
predict it better in the future
and when seen in the context of Nvidia
graphics cards deep learning describes
the platform's ability to optimize and
smooth out the experience in game it's
done by running the game in question
over and over and over again until the
neural network learned so much about a
games physics layout shadows composition
that it actually improves the user
experience with time the process
actually involves NVIDIA zone data
center so the more information that is
fed to them the better optimized in
theory the graphics card becomes with
respect to that particular title and
this is done on a game by game basis it
takes a lot of time for these servers to
study these games and
predicting them better and the super
sampling aspect of ELSS is a requirement
for these data centers to dissect unique
high-resolution scenes break them apart
study them and optimize the most
visually vital aspects of them so most
games can load enough into vram to the
point where calling a particular
instance is near effortless and
instantaneous it's why memory bandwidth
matters and why you'll probably never
hear it labeled as a true bottleneck and
to the extent that memory isn't the
bottleneck the GPU can for the most part
solve the problems in question and push
them in a fairly timely manner I mean if
you had any delays that would reflect on
your frame rate right it's why
parallelization is emphasized in the
graphics card market and that's
typically why we have thousands of CUDA
cores and stream processors occupying
our Nvidia and AMD graphics cards but
what if those GPUs become too bogged
down with computational workloads what
if the frame rate when enabling
something like DXR drastically lowers
sound familiar battlefield 5 when
something as taxing as rate racing is
turned on by a DX r in a game like
battlefield 5 the graphics card in
question needs every bit of help it can
get yes even the RT X cards real time
rate racing calculations to the extent
that they aren't predicted in advance
with AI are just too intense at this
point and the lack of our key core
optimization really doesn't help I mean
how many games right now support the XR
one so NVIDIA has been seeking to solve
this problem with legit servers whose
job it is to dissect these games and
predict events far in advance
that's easing the load on the GPU in a
real-time and improving the user
experience the tensor core is vital by
the way for this implementation and
that's why only our TX cards to date
have access to this feature so in a
nutshell DL SS frees up additional
graphics card resources for additional
rendering a byproduct of this is usually
an increase in framerate and a bump and
visual clarity which is why it's so
important with something like DX R
because DX R works the opposite by
dropping your frame rate for those added
reflections and more realistic just
verbiage and game although a major
downside of this is that to date only a
handful of games about 25 or so actually
plan to support DL SS so fans have been
videos tearing architecture will need to
keep their fingers crossed in hopes that
developers catch on and implement these
abilities of future tiles in fact I
think the number of games that support
both the X R and D LSS or that even will
in the coming months or years is 5 I
want to say it's like five games so yeah
they better catch on soon with that if

become a member you can do so by

appreciate that you can buy merch
similar to a shirt I wore in the last

fancy and I'll catch you in the next one
this is science studio thanks for
