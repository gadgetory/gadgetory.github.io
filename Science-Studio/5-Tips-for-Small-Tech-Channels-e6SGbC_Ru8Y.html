verdaguer I've only used vertigo your
chairs for the past year and I'll be
doing so for years to come not only for
the comfort factor but for the
durability whether you go racing or
organ amah Kyle stand the test of time
or the test of your body weight
regardless of your form factor click the
link in this video's description for
more details what's going on everyone
want to take the time in this video to
not only answer a few of your questions
especially for those out there who maybe
have smaller tech channels and want to
find ways to grow them and become unique
and and diversify their content a bit
but also make a few announcements that
might be pertinent to those fellow tech
tubers out there look it's not their
responsibility I can't get mad at them
for this but I really wish that the
bigger tech channels out there would do
more to kind of like cooperate and work
with the smaller tech channels it's
difficult to make a name for yourself
when the guys who have been doing this
for five or six years it's like two or
three times longer than say science
studio has been around have just kind of
shut themselves off from the smaller
tech tuber community right like they
have their audiences where they've had
for several years and those audiences
are pretty solidified right they don't
want to watch anything else because they
all they've known for six years is
insert favorite tech tuber here so
making a name for yourself is is
difficult to do it's important that you
that you find an ish you find your own
specialty that's different from what the
other guys are doing in order to grow
your channel so the first tip I'd like
to give to the fellow tech to out there
who might be struggling to break out are
like the 10,000 sub barrier I've been
there I mean we've all been there I know
exactly how tough that is how to make a
name for yourself is to invest in some
decent equipment now you don't have to
go out and buy a $4,000 camera or a
$3,000 audio setup in terms of which I
would weight is more important I think
that audio is a bit more important at
the beginning just because if your
audios trash no one's gonna want to
listen to you and if you're a tech tuber
it's important that they understand what
you're saying for the camera just get
something the films at 720p or 1080p
60fps is preferable but if you don't
want to spend more than about 300 bucks
you can get some pretty cheap DSLRs out
there even just dedicated HD film
cameras that you can mount to a tripod
just kind of set it up like I have this
one here and you should be alright on
the video side but the audio I think is
more
important go out and buy yourself a blue
snowball blue Yeti whatever you want to
do doesn't have to be an XLR interface
microphone at least in the beginning I'm
actually using a blue Yeti right now to
prove this concept like it's doable and
if you tweak things in Premiere or
whatever editing software you're using
then you can make your audio sound
fairly crisp essentially people are
linking professionalism to the content
they see on video and your videos are
your resume so if you have a video out
there that shouldn't be on your channel
maybe it's just kind of floating around
and it has nothing to do with the
content you're working on now delete it
okay you don't worry about whatever
money you're making from it it's not
pertinent to the name that you're trying
to make for yourself on your channel so
only upload content that has anything to
do with it if you have an exception
every now and then that's fine but make
sure that you're at least entertaining
your audience you don't want to shy them
away with one video that could lose you
a ton of subs and that rolls into tip2
quality over quantity it's difficult to
recommend that right now in YouTube's
current state because view counts all
across the board at least in our case
have dropped substantially I've noticed
that people aren't getting notifications
and their sub boxes maybe the videos
aren't showing up on their time lines or
their feeds it's all about how YouTube
prioritizes videos and right now it
seems like the big guys are doing ok the
middle guys are getting really squashed
and the small channels just don't even
have an opportunity to make money
because all their videos are being to
monetize the right out of the gate but
despite these things I do not recommend
something like a daily uploading
schedule it's just not gonna be good
especially for those who only or a
one-man show like I do all of my own
production work I film I edit I script I
do all of that at least up front what
you see on camera behind the scenes I
have will doing quite a bit of stuff but
up front it's it's really just just me
so I really have to pace myself because
I feel the urge sometimes to push out a
video on certain days and like I I need
to make a video today and then I don't
actually get into that creative mindset
and try to make something that people
actually want to see and then I'm like
wow I didn't get many views on that
video well it's because I didn't
actually take the time to produce
something that's worthwhile so choose
the quality upload it's more of a
long-term investment I know but it will
pay off especially when people start
moving to your channel later on you get
a series of these viral videos these
videos that are doing really well on
your channel people say wow that channel
is actually got a lot of good content on
I'm gonna sub to it versus wow that
channel it's got like one video that's
actually decent out of the hundred
videos that are pretty trashy so I'm not
going to sub to that there's your
difference and stuff
counts are usually related to the
perception that companies have a view
and that's how you get in with companies
to receive products to review now that
rolls us in to tip 3 don't be afraid to
go to your local Best Buy your Micro
Center what have you to purchase your
own equipment for review now don't drain
your bank account because it might not
pay off immediately and you'll be broke
for a good time but you should go out
and buy something at least buy something
that maybe you know you can't get from a
company upfront but maybe you want the
interest of the company in the long run
you can say hey I went out and got this
car and I reviewed it it's done well in
the channel I want to do something else
you can email marketing rep for that
company and say hey I've already done
this send me another product I can do
this again and I have a bigger audience
now so we can kind of grow together
start this cooperation upfront that
that's maybe a way you can get the
attention of big companies you can also
just send them emails outright and say
hey I want something but usually they
depend on like meu calves and sub cows
and it's difficult for a small channel
to get that attention out of the gate
now if you don't have the budget for a
new hardware
don't fret check your closet maybe your
attic for some vintage hardware I'm
talking like 1020 years old this stuff
is actually pretty popular in the tech
tuber community and it costs $0 to to go
out and buy because you already have it
so I take your chance there maybe maybe
it'll go viral be sure it on a ton of
forums and that's how you get your name
mentioned and spread on the Internet
now let's segue into tip 4 let's say you
produce that video took a week to
produce and you're really happy about it
and you publish it and it gets maybe a
hundred views or whatever like the
average of you account for your video is
on your channel nothing really stood out
about it right even though you put all
this effort all this time into it so
much more time than your other videos on
the channel and it just didn't go
anywhere don't be discouraged by that
that that isn't usually a sign of just
you not being creative it's just a sign
that like hey okay YouTube didn't
prioritize this video maybe had
something to do with the sub count or
the like to dislike ratio maybe they'd
have enough comments on it there are a
lot of variables at play here YouTube is
a very difficult thing to just figure
out black and white although it does
read a bunch of like tags and stuff and
articles if you're a small channel
you're not going to get that exposure
that you want out of the gate so you
have to rely on on the viewer to share
it on to a popular forum and for it to
take off there well if you don't get
that it doesn't mean that you weren't
creative it just means that you got to
try it again try it a different way
listen to your viewer base not the ones
that come in and watch one
video and then leave forever I'm talking
about the loyal subsys show up every
week every video they are your direct
feedback listen to them I guarantee your
channel will grow if you do that brings
us to our final tip tip 5 this one's
about money I do recommend that as soon
as you can monetize your channel it's
not really about the money in the
beginning because you won't make much of
it and I can tell you I made you know
pocket change for the first 6 months of
starting the channel out which is why
most people who are gonna be doing that
also have a full-time job or in college
full-time or high school or what have
you and it's difficult to prioritize
time for the channel that's not making
you much money but the earlier you
monetize a channel the quicker you'll
start to see that revenue growth and if
you want to turn it into a full-time job
it's important that you see that from
the very beginning because then you see
just like these stepping stones right
the progress over time that's your
motivation to keep innovating and
continue to make videos look I make no
secret of it here I have an engineering
degree I'm working on my masters in
business I much prefer doing this than
working on our rig or working in an
office bossing people around making them
hate me in the long run this is just
it's just so much less stressful and
apart from the few trolls that you get
every now and then it's just inevitable
with the youtuber space I really enjoy
the community I really do those who have
stuck with me from the beginning who've
been here since 10,000 subs you guys are
the best those who donate on patreon
more than I could ever ask for those who
purchase products via our Amazon and
Newegg affiliate links those I'll give a
small kickbacks it lets me continue
doing what I do it literally pays for my
rent and my power bill it's a heck of a
job wouldn't trade it for the world but
I can guarantee if I never monetize my
channel and didn't plan on this becoming
a full-time gig I wouldn't be here today
I did it more or less in the beginning
because I was like wow I can actually
make money from videos that's kind of
cool I didn't really know how YouTube
worked I just started making videos
because I was bored one summer but then
once the once the revenue started
rolling in I mean those are being kind
of upfront with you about this and this
is what all tech tubers experienced
especially the big guys get these
paychecks from Google from Amazon and
Newegg and what have you because viewers
are engaged on your channel it's like
your validation it's the motivation you
need to keep making videos to keep
changing trying new things because
that's how a channel grows so monetize
your channel even if you don't expect to
make much money from it because if it
does end up turning into a full-time
career you
thank yourself for doing this early as
you did because then you've realized
then well I could actually I could do
this on a semi weekly basis and actually
make some pretty good money from this
this could turn into a career it's not
the money that you should be doing it
for because if you're only doing it for
the money then you'll never innovate so
keep trying new things keep doing things
that make you stand out from the crowd
because the tech tuber market right now
on YouTube is so so saturated we got in
it just before the last wave of tech
tubers really started hitting a scene
and I'll admit sometimes I find myself
like in this position I'm like why am I
even doing this like five other people
have already done it and they already
have tons of views in their videos like
whoa who's gonna want to watch me that
makes you try new things it makes you
look at it from a different perspective
because you want to be different you
want people to see that you're different
so that they stay loyal to your channel
know that we've gotten through all five
more tips if you're still watching this
video you are a loyal viewer I
appreciate that maybe you care a lot
about your tech channel you wanted to
watch all of those things you're gonna
probably care about what I have to say
next as well so going back to what I
said about the big tech channel is not
really like doing enough in my opinion
to to give the smaller tech channels the
exposure that I think they deserve not
that we're asking for handouts but just
you know come on they collaborate with
themselves why won't they collaborate
with channels smaller than them I don't
think there's anything wrong with that
if the other channel that smaller is
still unique what I want to do is create
a series in this channel where every
week we review maybe five or six tech
channels on YouTube kind of go through
their videos I'll literally sit down one
day and go through a ton of your
channels videos and point out the ones
and a dedicated video that I like the
best to give you exposure that I think
you do deserve so in the comments
section this video give me a link to
your tech channel we'll go through a
bunch of them this week and then we'll
set up some sort of series where maybe
you can be featured on science studio
look I know YouTube is saturated with
tech channels that's kind of the point
that's why I want to do this because I
want you as the viewer and as the tech
channel to filter out the noise the
stuff that is just you know people are
trying hard but for no reason because
they've no passion if you have an itch
if you have something that's unique I
want to see your channel I want to
showcase it I want to reveal it to the
rest of our of your basis at least
because I think we should all be
supporting each other in one form or
another and maybe we'll get the bigger
tech channels to do that at some point
as
well so with that don't be afraid to
comment down below if you like this
video be sure you give a thumbs up I
appreciate that and click that red
subscribe button by the way for more
content that has to do with science
this is science studio thanks for
