at this point basically on vacation now
that the be quiet tour is finished and
that explains the weird background here
and the lackluster audio but I have been
using my macbook to find some ridiculous
sales online this time the eBay Edition
first up on our lists here and you've
got to ask yourself what on earth is
going through this retailers mind this
is a z97 board from ACS three
generations old mind you and they're
asking eleven hundred and forty two
dollars for it here's an i7 69 50 X ten
core Broadwell ECP you and they want
2500 us are they not aware that you can
actually buy the same chip on Newegg
brand new for sixteen hundred no this
actually isn't too good to deal when you
take into account the fact that you buy
seven 100 x four actually cheaper than
that now these are both US sellers by
the way this person thinks just because
he has a Vegas 64 GPU on pre-order you
can subsequently charge twelve hundred
and forty eight dollars for it please do
not buy one anywhere near this price
this is so bad five hundred and sixteen
dollar asking price for a micro ATX
asrock h97 motherboard here we go
yelling Horus from the United States
asking thirteen hundred fourteen dollars
and 87 cents for his ROG Strix GTX 1080s
TI it's just a 1080 oh and in case
you're wondering financing is available
this right here is officially the
highest priced PC case anywhere on eBay
that I could find is the Thermaltake
level 10 titanium Edition asking price
just seven grand here's a delusional
mining crazed reseller EVGA gtx ten
seventy nine hundred and thirty five
dollars not exactly sure what I'm
looking at here but what I can discern
looks like a steel case I think it was a
very dug up and it's into a war zone the
power strip on top is just a bonus but
hey at least it's got a basement and all
of this can be yours for just five
hundred US plus seven hundred and ninety
dollars for shipping here's one I teased
on Twitter this guy's asking $1200 for
an Intel Core i3 gtx 750ti computer
build and check this out see he's
assuring us this a very expensive and
reliable pc so it's got to be a great
deal yeah oh and by the way does this
cable management remind anyone of a
squid thanks Tony for that one now you
can't unsee it I searched Ram on eBay
and the highest priced item was a Dodge
Ram 1500 asking price four hundred and
fifty thousand dollars here we go real
RAM 463 US dollar asking price for a 16
gig kit of laptop grade ddr3 this is
being sold from the United States mind
you just for kicks here's a $35,000
dollar virtue phone it clipped with a
gold frame and genuine diamonds - you
bet it looks like a Nokia from 2005 this
is a 1080p Alienware monitor bundled
with an alienware keyboard and alienware
mouse for three thousand US dollars why
because Alienware just kidding seriously
because Alienware here's an i7 49 60 X 4
$4,500 nothing more to say here not
exactly sure what's special about this
keyboard but for nearly three and a half
grand it better cook me dinner what's
more concerning the fact that they've
already sold six of these
now this one's actually kind of cool so
this is an original Apple iPhone
unopened verified by Apple themselves
according to the seller four gigabytes
which is supposedly rare than the eight
and 16 counterparts because the four was
discontinued when they realize that how
many people wanted the four gig variant
and the asking price is seventy three
hundred dollars not so sure about that
price it's oddly specific but it's firm
according to the seller I'm an expert in
this realm but you know I've got another
phone up here to finish things off this
one is the LG L 52 V probably something
you could buy in Walmart for around 50
bucks and the asking price here is 6495
USD this one being sold from Anaheim
California so it seems like as this
video series progresses we are managing
to find worse and worse deals which to
an extent is entertaining that's kind of
what these videos have been about it's
the purpose of these videos but their
underlying purpose here is that you
should really do your research before
you go out and purchase products like
these especially from sketchy sellers
that aren't mainstream maybe Amazon or
Newegg if you're in the States
some other reputable vendor from your
country I would say for the most parts
going to be pretty reliable when it
comes to honest pricing but when it
comes to third-party resellers
individual sellers even like myself
price check check
everywhere even if it seems convenient
it seems like a good deal at a time I
mean look several people fell for some
of these price scams I mean that's
literally what they are they're scams
and that's why in a sense
I don't mind exposing these people
they're asking outrageous prices and
they're trying to just use the ignorant
of the consumer to make a huge profit I
was very pleased with the enthusiasm and
number of submissions we have two part
two of this series which you can check
out right here by the way so I'm going
to open up another Twitter just chain
for all of you to post submissions for
part force we're going to do review all
the links that you guys post I mean it's
it's easy for me I'm gonna be honest so
I don't have to do the research you guys
are kind of doing it for me
I'll review them make sure that they're
legit they're not you know actually good
deals and then I'll give you credit for
those links in part four in that video
it'll be just like this video just like
part two and part one so get active on
that I appreciate all of the submissions
be sure to donate on patreon if you want
to be super cool all that money gets
recycled back to the channel thanks
videos look better audio sound better
stuff like that you can also follow me
on instagram and elsewhere to get a
little more involved on things that
aren't YouTube related because I want to
branch out just just a little bit more
if you like to see - be sure to give a
thumbs up thumbs down for the opposite
click and subscribe but if you haven't
already and stay tuned for real science
here on the channel this is science
studio thanks for learning with this
