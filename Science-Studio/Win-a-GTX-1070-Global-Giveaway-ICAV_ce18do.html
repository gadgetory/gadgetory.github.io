things about to happen here in the
studio one of which will be pretty big
for one of you and the other thing will
be pretty big for Walter white version
2.0 I've been teasing it for a couple
videos now and the parts are almost here
so what did I purchase for Walter White
to EVGA GTX 10 70s I think the just the
standard superclocked editions I didn't
bother spending more money for the
higher Bruce clock so I'll just do that
manually and then I also purchased a
Zeon 26 30 V 4 I'm pretty sure that's
what it is
you see the specs right there 10 core 20
thread processor it's a Xeon so it won't
have an unlock multiplier like it's very
similar 69 50 X counterpart but I might
be able to get a few extra hundred
megahertz or so out of a base clock
overclock I have no idea maybe 50
megahertz who knows we'll try that all
out once the parts get here they'll be
here around this weekend so a lot of
parts often will be happening this
weekend I'll be sure to film all of that
for you but I want to make very clear
that what I intend to use walter white
version 2.0 for has nothing to do with
gaming now I might game on the machine
and I understand that as a result of
moving from a 6700 K to a lock to Xeon
ten core 23rd processor won't benefit me
when it comes to gaming in fact I mean I
expect to lose a few frames in that
regard but that's why the 210 70s are
gonna be thrown into there that's just
gonna basically solidify any kind of
game setting I want make sure that I get
the stable frame rate that I need at the
current resolution monitors that I'm
running so ultra wide 1080p and 1440p
with 144 Hertz refresh rate I'm already
right now pushing 144 Hertz in 1080p
with a single 1070 so I expect the
second one just gonna be overkill if I
moved it to 4k monitors I expected I
should get around 60 fps and most titles
with 210 70s in that 10 core Xeon now
onto the second part of the video I'm
sure this is the part you care a little
more about I don't blame you the
giveaway I'm giving away the gtx 1070 in
walter white I guess the version 1.0 I
can call it now you're looking at the
asus strix rog gtx 1070 it is white it's
normally black I painted a white you can
check that out in video it's gonna be in
one side or the other I'm not sure which
side it's going to be on I'm looking at
myself reflected so it's kind of
confusing
this this card has a very very liberal
base clock and a actually very decent
boost clock as well I think we're around
1900 megahertz out of the box I think
it's like 1860 or so numbers gonna be
right there but it is a beast of a card
and I hope whoever wins it uses it a lot
it's why I purchased the 1070 in the
first place for Walter white version 1.0
it can pretty much play any game I won
in 1440p and very very high settings and
very very high frame rates so with that
how do you enter the giveaway I'm not
gonna do anything complex I'm not gonna
do a like a link click here and then you
can enter and prove that you do this and
that I just want you to follow me on
Instagram and Twitter that way if you
have an Instagram but don't use the
Twitter you're still eligible for the
giveaway and then if you have a Twitter
but don't use Instagram you can still be
eligible for the giveaway so it's kind
of the best of both worlds if you don't
use social media at all I'm sorry you're
on YouTube though I suggest you use one
or the other but this way I kind of get
something back this helps me out in the
long run I know it doesn't really mean
much to all of you and I just post
pictures and talk about things behind
the scenes I don't it could be
interesting for you but for the most
part this is just a way of you guys
helping me out apart from just watching
my videos because social media outlets
for tech tubers especially can can mean
a lot in the long run not right now but
maybe in the future I will have a bit of
leverage there so it's something that I
could use not only to reach out to fans
into other companies but use as a source
of revenue it actually is possible to
make money from just retweeting things
and stuff and that's that's something
that I look forward to if we get to that
point I can use that as a reason to stay
away from just corporate life and just
keep doing YouTube full-time so if you
guys want me around that's why I'm doing
it this would be my ideal job honestly I
would love doing this I would love to
just stay away from any other career out
there and just keep doing this it's it's
a it's a really fun job I consider it a
job it's a but it's it's it doesn't feel
like a job that's why I know that I want
to do it as long as possible so that's
why there's social media things there I
know you guys gave me crap for that in
the last giveaway but that's why it's
there you don't have to agree with me if
you don't like the fact that I'm making
you follow me on Twitter and Instagram
for the giveaway don't follow me on
Twitter or Instagram for the giveaway as
simple as that
you can complain in the comments but I'm
telling you why I'm doing it there's a
reason
I'm doing it but me giving this card to
one of you is just a very simple way of
me saying thanks for sticking around
with me as long as you have I know it's
not easy it's not easy putting up with
me but yeah you guys have been very
loyal and I appreciate that so do those
two things just follow me on Twitter
Instagram you can try your luck and
follow me on one or the other that you
know your odds are double essentially if
you follow me on both I have not a lot
of Instagram followers right now so
that's probably your best bet
this is science to do good luck in the
giveaway and stay tuned for version 2.0
of Walter White thanks for learning with
this
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
