things about to happen here in the
studio one of which will be pretty big
for one of you and the other thing will
be pretty big for walter white version 2
point 0 I've been teasing it for a
couple videos now and the parts are
almost here so what did I purchase for
Walter White two EVGA GTX 10 70s I think
the just the standard superclocked
editions I didn't bother spending more
money for the higher boost clock so I'll
just do that manually and then I also
purchased a Zeon 26-30 v4 pretty sure
that's what it is you see the specs
right there 10 core 20 thread processor
it's a Zeon so it won't have an unlocked
multiplier like it's very similar 6950 X
counterpart but I might be able to get a
few extra hundred megahertz or so out of
a base clock overclock I have no idea
maybe 50 megahertz who knows we'll try
that all out once the parts get here
they'll be here around this weekend so a
lot of parts weapon will be happening
this weekend i'll be sure to film all
that for you but I want to make very
clear that what I intend to use walter
white version 2.4 has nothing to do with
gaming now I might game on the machine
and I understand that as a result of
moving from a 6700 k to a lock to Z on
10 core 23rd processor won't benefit me
when it comes to gaming in fact I'm I
expect to lose a few frames in that
regard but that's why the 210 70s are
gonna be thrown into there that's just
going to basically solidify any kind of
game setting I want make sure that I get
the stable frame rate that I need at the
current resolution monitors that I'm
running so ultra wide 1080p and 1440p
with 144 words refresh rate i'm already
right now pushing a hundred forty-four
hurts in 1080p with a single 1070 so i
expect the second one just going to be
overkill if I moved it to 4k monitors i
expected i should get around 60 FPS and
most titles with 210 70s in that 10 core
xeon now on to the second part of the
video i'm sure this is the part you care
a little more about I don't blame you
the give away i'm giving away the gtx
1070 in Walter White I guess version 1
point 0 I can call it now you're looking
at the asus strix rog gtx 1070 it is
white it's normally black I painted a
white you can check that out in video
it's going to be in one side or the
other I'm not sure which side is going
to be on I'm looking at myself reflected
so it's kind of confusing but this this
card
very very liberal base clock and a
actually very decent boost clock as well
I think we're around 1900 megahertz out
of the box i think it's like eighteen
sixty or so number is going to be right
there but it is a beast of a card and i
hope whoever wins it uses it a lot it's
why i purchased the 1070 in the first
place for walter white version 1.8 can
pretty much play any game i won in 1440p
and very very high settings and very
very high frame rates so with that how
do you enter the giveaway I'm not gonna
do anything complex I'm not going to do
it like a link click here and then you
can enter and prove that you do this and
that I just want you to follow me on
instagram and twitter that way if you
have an instagram but don't use a
twitter you're still eligible for the
giveaway and then if you have a twitter
but don't use instagram you can still be
eligible for the giveaway so it's kind
of the best of both worlds if you don't
use social media at all I'm sorry you're
on YouTube though I suggest you use one
or the other but this way I kind of get
something back this helps me out of the
long run I know it doesn't really mean
much to all of you and I just post
pictures and talk about things behind
the scenes on it could be interesting
for you but for the most part this is
just a way of you guys helping me out
apart from just watching my videos
because social media outlets for tech
tubers especially can can mean a lot in
the long run not right now but maybe in
the future I will have a bit of leverage
there so it's something that I could use
not only to reach out to fans into other
companies but uses a source of revenue
it actually is possible to make money
from just retweeting things and stuff
and that's that's something that I look
forward to if we get to that point I can
use that as a reason to stay away from
just corporate life and just keep doing
YouTube full-time so if you guys want me
around that's why I'm doing it this
would be my ideal job honestly I would
love doing this I would love to just
stay away from any other career out
there and just keep doing this it's it's
a it's a really fun job I consider it a
job it's a but it's it's it doesn't feel
like a job that's why I know that I want
to do it as long as possible so that's
why the social media things there I know
you guys gave me crap for that in the
last giveaway but that's why it's there
you don't have to agree with me if you
don't like the fact that I'm making you
follow me on Twitter and Instagram for
the giveaway don't follow me on twitter
or instagram for the giveaway as simple
as that you can complain in the comments
but i'm telling you why I'm doing it
there's a reason why I'm doing it but me
giving this card to one of you is just
a very simple way of me saying thanks
for sticking around with me as long as
you have I know it's not easy it's not
easy putting up with me but you guys
have been very loyal and I appreciate
that so do those two things just follow
me on twitter instagram you can try your
luck and follow me on one or the other
but you know your odds are double
essentially if you follow me on both i
have not a lot of Instagram followers
right now so that's probably your best
bet this is signed studio good luck in
the giveaway and stay tuned for version
2 point 0 of Walter White thanks for
learning with this
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
