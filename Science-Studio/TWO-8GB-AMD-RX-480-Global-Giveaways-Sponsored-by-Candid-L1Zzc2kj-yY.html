this is the first time that I've ever
been able to collaborate with another
company for the sake of giving away two
great products so first let me give you
the rundown of who candid is and the fun
anonymous app that they've just released
it reminds me of Instagram and Twitter
in a way but with a refined organized
personal twist so when you first
download the candidate app you'll be
asked to select topics that interest you
this is where the organization comes in
i selected technology and was
immediately immersed in a cool community
of fellow candid users interested in the
same thing i was some asked questions
others passed along news articles and
still others voice their opinions on
certain current events in the industry
you can also search for other groups
like space politics science in general
and anything you can think about that we
talked about here on this channel you
can probably find on ken there's a lot
out there so let me give you an example
if I scroll through the tech group with
over 20,000 members I'm surfing through
unique posts from unique anonymous
individuals interested in technology
this one reads agree for google glass
every day seemed like such a cool idea
so i can choose to either like that post
dislike that post comment anonymously or
share it to other social media outlets
like twitter and facebook another post
reads am i the only one who doesn't mind
Apple removing the headphone jack from
the iphone 7 so i'll leave a comment
that says yes you are the only one and
just like that boom completely anonymous
with zero hassle something set up
already that i would like all of you to
join is the official science to do group
on candid so here we can all ask
questions post cool articles and help
each other out picture like a forum but
without the added pressure of
maintaining a snow-white reputation on a
typical forum everyone for the most part
knows who everyone else is or can gain
access to the information that would
reveal who you are something like maybe
a full name or website URL and boom your
cover's blown so any opinion you happen
to post that could be kind of sort of
controversial could isolate your support
groups however on candid everything you
post is one hundred percent discreet so
everyone following the group that you
posted can see what you've posted but no
one will know who you are the app is
also constantly being moderated by folks
working out of San Francisco so anything
off topic or inappropriate can be dealt
with swiftly and accurately so if you
haven't already pick up your smartphone
download the candid app join the science
dude
group if you haven't already I think
that would be a pretty cool way for all
of us to communicate so if you haven't
have a problem someday maybe your
computer just doesn't turn on at all
randomly someday you can post on your
phone to the science to do group within
candid and people like myself can try
our best to help you out sort you
through those issues anything like that
I think would be great way to just for
us to communicate and it saves me the
hassle from having to build a website
from scratch now candid seems like the
best bet candid and I have also
collaborated on this epic giveaway as
well which is eligible to anyone
anywhere in the world I'm aware that
shipping rates can be a bit extreme
depending on where you happen to be
relative to my location here in
Lafayette Louisiana but I don't really
care about the price this is the first
ever sponsored science to do give away
and I want it to be fair for everyone
not just those who happen to live close
to me so a candid and science to do are

gigabyte rx4 80s from AMD ones coming
