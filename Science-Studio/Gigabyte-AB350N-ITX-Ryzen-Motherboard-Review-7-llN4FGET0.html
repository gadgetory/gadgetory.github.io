from gigabyte it isn't the first ever in
this form factor but it is one of the
best you can currently buy despite its
odd quirks we're going to cover all of
that in this video including overclock
ability feature sets and pricing I'd
first like to address motherboard
features most of the stuff you can just
read online I say that pretty much every
motherboard review video at this point
but there are a few strange locations a
few placements that might have you
scratching your head starting first with
the rear i/o this is pretty much typical
stuff HDMI display ports for AMD APU s
7.1 surround sound but no optical
support six USB 3.1 port 2 Witcher
type-a and a single rj45 port oh and a
ps2 port though if you're still using
this in 2017 and I don't know a huge
selling point of this motherboard though
onboard Wi-Fi that's a huge plus
especially in this form factor now on to
the internals this board layout is a bit
unorthodox
sure the CPU socket is centered but RAM
slots are off to the far right where the
24 pin and SATA usually are gigabytes
have done this to make room for stock
AMD coolers which can be a bit bulky see
the slots occupy the far right side of
the board so everything that would
normally go here on a typical
motherboard including 24 pin SATA like I
said that's all been moved up here most
coolers fit pretty snug but it's no
different on Intel side with its squared
off layout the typical format had to be
altered but gigabytes done a fair job on
account of the new socket a few extra
compromises have to be made more so than
what I mentioned in this video right
here you always lose a few features but
in this case a few mandatory features
had to be moved to strange new places on
the board take this 24 pin for example
it's all the way at the top of the board
so you'll have to route your cable
through the top of your case not the
right side where it usually is routed
and here's the 8 pin EPS dock way down
here behind the mosfet heatsink super
strange indeed these locations could
drive you crazy USB 3.0 is also up top
as is the front IO dock and all SATA
ports potentially a cable management
nightmare depending on which case you
choose nonetheless I cannot go without
stating these downfalls in this review
oh and I suppose all
having only to fan hubs is pretty
negative you'll have to find a fan hub
without a doubt beep lemon using a case
like the NZXT manta but don't worry this
is where the quirkiness stops everything
else about this board is what you might
expect from gigabyte by this point those
are positives for one overclocking is
consistent and actually decent for a
board of this size and also considering
the fact that it's only a be 350 chip
and not the X 370 supreme overclock or
chipset I get the exact same overclocks
with both my 1600 and 1700 X rise in
CPUs 3.9 gigahertz of piece that I hit
with the Auris X 370 board as far as I'm
concerned the systems are stable at
these frequencies even under heavy load
and I 264 my Ram frequency is still a
bit finicky though I can't pass 20 400
megahertz despite BIOS updates though
I'd point to the use of this platform as
the cause since most manufacturers are
still dealing with these repercussions
new eggs even pretty blunt about this on
their website something I did not expect
with the a be 350 n was it's full on RGB
support not only from just a hardware
standpoint you have LEDs kind of lining
a full right side of this board but also
peripherally the RGB fusion software
gives users a variety of color presets
which can be mixed with different pulses
and cycling effects it's a nice touch
for a board that won't break the bank
another pleasant surprise with the RGB W
LED header near the PCIe slot if for
extended light strips with a dedicated
white LED hence the v 10 this port also
supports a single m2 slot around the
back which is always nice on a 90 X
board and onboard Bluetooth 4.1 for
wireless device connectivity now many of
you are asking for BIOS UEFI tours and
motherboard review videos so here you go
this is gigabyte signature BIOS UI
pretty consistent across both Intel and
AMD platforms at this point in time you
find all of your overclock settings here
on the far left page you also have a fan
control software built into the BIOS so
that you can kind of visually manipulate
your fan curves and as mentioned earlier
you'll also find the RGB fusion app
where you can manipulate motherboard
colors and cycling effects the
simplicity here is key I'm glad to go
right ahead and change too much with
this particular UEFI it's very easy
through which to navigate and it's not
buggy at all I haven't had a single
crash since I've started testing this
board look I know it has some quirks and
I don't know how much of that gigabyte
could really control given the youth of
the platform and the form factor this is
one of the first
on the market by the way but it has the
typical gigabyte Flair it has the beauty
looks it has the RGB integration it has
the steel-reinforced PCIe slot down
below it has onboard Wi-Fi you get that
out of the box it's it's a nice board it
just has a few quirks that are going to
be difficult to get around for some
depending on your case choice like I
said but I still recommend it
maybe not for all ITX builds it would
look pretty weird in NZXT Manta due to
its strange
io placement but it worked nicely in
something like a fractal node - OH - a
true small form-factor build the ab3 15
is also a decent price just over 100 US
dollars which isn't an extraordinary
figure given the form factor smaller pcs
tend to cost a bit more especially when
it comes to power supply so having a
board at this price with all the
features that gigabytes included is very
nice so if you're in the market for a
small form-factor rise in PC build as
most budget conscious consumers are and
should be don't look any further than
this motherboard right here just have a
plan for dealing with these weird power
and peripheral placements as well as the
sheer lack of fan hubs with the gigabyte
AV 350 in gaming Wi-Fi the pros
definitely outweigh the cons as usual
