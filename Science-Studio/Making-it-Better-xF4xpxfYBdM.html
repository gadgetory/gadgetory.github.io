extreme graphics card it's definitely a
beefcake and an odd-looking one at that
judging from initial impressions on
Twitter you're likely either to love it
or absolutely hate it personally I love
the design I've got a special thing for
triple fan coolers and this one brings a
little something extra to the table
these beautiful LEDs now while they
might not look like much at first
especially seeing as the one led perf an
existing on one fan blade per fan there
are many different effects to take
advantage of and I encourage you to
watch this video right here if you
haven't already because it's where we
discuss many of those lighting effects
but I still think that this card could
look better when we last met up with you
good buy it in Miami where they debuted
the card I asked them if they plan to
release different colors like white or
silver I thought that the lighting
scheme could benefit from a lighter
shroud color and I think that's an you
know an okay assumption to make but to
my disappointment the plan was to stick
with just black that's where this video
comes in time to paint another graphics
card
so the first step in this process was to
disassemble the entire car down to bare
PCB at this point I wasn't sure if I
wanted to just paint the fan shroud or
the entire frame so I disassembled
everything record like this you'll also
want to remove any metal accents and
logos before painting for obvious
reasons you want to keep those bare they
usually just tell them by a few screws
by the way you can take advantage of
this time to replace the stock thermal
compound with something a bit more
mainstream if you wish although r-tx
cards in general aren't going to be
limited thermally by nature of this
cards design you can remove though the
entire heatsink and reinstall that along
with the fan array without needing to
attach any section of the plastic frame
I decided in the moment only to paint
the shroud since I plan to turn the card
vertically with a cable on riser
resulting in the backplate being
completely hidden so with all of the
smaller accents and details removed I
cleaned up the shroud and removed as
much dust and debris as I could you can
also take this time to mask off any
sensitive areas if you so desire as for
paint I chose rust-oleum
high-performance engine enamel it
certainly isn't as removable as say
Plasti Dip but the finish is much
cleaner with only a few coats in my
opinion and typically won't require any
extra layers of gloss so in my
experience plastidip is also
considerably more sensitive to ambient
temperatures I've used both probably
used plastidip more to be honest but
when I use plastic tip especially when
it's cold outside which it's not really
any more but when I first try to do this
with the white plastic tip it just
didn't stick well didn't adhere well to
the plastic and it would kind of harden
in these clumps and it just wasn't a
smooth finish I switched to the rest
Oleum enamel and under the same
conditions practically that paint just
just stuck to the surface much better so
if you're a little you know concerned
about that maybe you're a first-time
painter I would say Plasti Dip is going
to be more forgiving because you can
remove it right it's just like a
peelable plastic so in that sense you
could just keep retrying over and over
but I would say go for the rest Oh Liam
because it's going to first I'll give
you a cleaner finish it'll be easier to
start with and you can practice on
practically anything beforehand so
if you're that concerned about messing
it up the first time just take some
small objects you don't care about paint
those first get used to the coats and
then you can move on to the more
important objects now as for my painting
studio yeah just a single box and a
paint can cap to keep the card propped
up I highly recommend you paint these
components while they're suspended at
least somewhat in the air otherwise you
could have paint stick to the box or
whatever you're painting on and that
could totally ruin your finish this is
especially the case for Plasti Dip it
tends to be really sticky even when it
dries shake the can rigorously for a few
minutes make sure the ball inside is
moving freely and then try a few test
sprays at different distances I try to
stay around eight to ten inches away any
closer and you're likely to overspray
resulting in unwanted puddles of
especially wet paint that you never
really get to dry in a consistent
fashion now you shouldn't expect a clean
finish after your first coat even if you
have a few areas that aren't completely
covered I mean it was there somewhat
covered that's okay come back for the
next coat and emphasize those areas
first we're going getting things as
smooth as possible over time and that's
why staying further away is better in
the long run one of the best things
about this paint is that it dries fairly
quick at around 15 minutes per coat but
that doesn't mean you should be handling
the shroud after said time frame you
could still leave fingerprints and oils
in the finish while the layer is soft
which is where the paint cap underneath
again comes in handy you can grab that
and rotate the shroud as many times as
necessary to ensure that you've covered
as much of the surface as possible so
again that's 15 to 20 minutes between
coats rotate spray and repeat until the
desired finish is obtained make sure you
cover the corners of the shroud the
sharp edges the crevices and even the
inside of the shroud since you'll be
able to see underneath when the card is
turned vertically in your bill assuming
you're going to it be a sin in my
opinion to not turn this card vertically
because it looks so good sideways just
make sure the paint on the other side
though if you flip it upside down has
thoroughly dried first I know it seems
like I'm spewing a ton of directions at
once but I want to make sure that I
cover all my bases here because painting
isn't something that most people can
just pick up and be good at the first
time especially we're talking about
spray painting is every can is different
and all the paints are gonna set
differently and every object in question
creates new challenges so if you're
concerned again like I'm not trying to
scare you away from it I'm in fact I
encourage you to annex
to do this because you can you know make
these things kind of your own make them
look even more custom than before but I
suggest practicing on other things first
work on getting that consistent finish
and then move on to the more important
parts later the silver enamel I chose
for this project actually turned out
quite well and nearly matches our course
aired on Platts AI oh and a gigabyte
motherboard I've linked all these
components by the way in the video
description so if you're interested in
building something similar you'll have a
frame of reference this is not a cheap
build by any means it's actually the one
that I edit with consistently and
occasionally play games with - hence the
smaller 144th monitor right here in my
writes there's a 24 inch 1080p monitor
all in all though this is one of the
more powerful attending rigs that I've
worked with and I'm really impressed
with how snappy the 9900 K is with its
IGP when scrubbing the timeline or
rendering the r-tx 20/80 is good
especially for encoding and streaming
which I do again a lot of playing with
this ultra wide 1440p resolution or just
looking sharp in the background I mean
who doesn't like that look I know you
guys were kind of upset this evening you
know some of your joking about seizures
or whatever but it looks worse on camera
because again I got a sink the shutter
speed up with the rotation of the fans
and so because the fan LEDs are blinking
right to kind of sync up with the human
eye based on how fast they're rotating
it really has to be in sync with the
shutter speed in this case it's
definitely not so that's why it looks
really spotty but to the human eye in
real life it looks very flushed very
consistent only a small degree of
blinking there so you can see here if I
alter the shutter speed of my camera I
can make this thing look much smoother
and that is in fact how it looks again
in real life and so again in my opinion
now that we've painted this shroud
silver the lights have just a more
reflective surface to work with so I
think that I've improved the overall
aesthetic of the card and look I'm not
knocking on gigabyte for omitting white
or silver variants I don't think that's
a negative not something that I would
like give four stars instead of five or
whatever on a review site like Amazon
our new egg I imagine most would still
be interested actually in a neutral
black version and hey at least they made
disassembly a relatively simple process
so I've worked with other cards that are
a completely different story and that's
a pain in the butt and we don't you
like to paint those kinds of cards but
yeah this one's actually pretty simple
to disassemble despite its kind of
ominous like feature set like what it
looks like it looks like it would be a
painted disassemble it is not that's a
good thing especially for us painters
out there so with that I'd like to know
what you think about this color scheme
the finish the overall theme of the
build obviously the idea here was for
black and silver so if you're not a fan
of either of those colors then yeah it's
not gonna look too great
we've got matching cable Mod cables and
heck we've even got these fan blades in
gray from Corsair so I really tried to
match as much as possible and it was
definitely fun to build I'm sure I'll do
it again soon with that I'll ask you
guys to leave a like or just like to
