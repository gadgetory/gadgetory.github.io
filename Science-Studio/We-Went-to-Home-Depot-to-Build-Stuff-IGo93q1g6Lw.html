behind the camera for today Thank You
buh-bye was actually gonna be helping me
out with my I guess I didn't really talk
to you about helping me I guess I just
kind of funneled you into here and said
hey you're gonna help me build a couple
desk today execute that anyway we have
to build two desks like I talked about
the previous video in here
I want one room look I'm running along
this wall and another one running along
the back wall there so you see we got
about maybe seven to eight feet worth of
space just lengthwise on both sides of
the wall and we want to go to Home Depot
to get the wood cut for these tests now
as far as I'm aware they don't just make
a desk this long that you can you know
buy outright and put in your room and if
they do they're pretty expensive and you
have to special order most of them so
we're gonna build these desks ourselves
or at least assemble them once they've
been cut now the pieces of wood that we
need to cut are going to be basically
two by fours we're gonna try to get two
by fours cut in half two by twos we're
gonna need some legs so we have
essentially now ten legs so we're gonna
do two desks remember so five legs for
each desk two on the corners of each and
then one in the back Center and then
we're gonna need two by twos which are
going to be consisting of the frame 21
inches 17 inches we'll talk about that
in a second and then the desk tops of
each the one on both side is going to be
about a hundred and twelve inches long
and the one on my side of the wall is
going to be about a hundred inches long
so these are the basic dimensions kind
of what I'll pass along to the guy who's
going to cut the wood for us at Home
Depot hopefully and this is roughly what
they should look like at least the frame
but we're about this because this is the
scale but the frame here is gonna
consist of two by twos going around
we're not sure if we gonna have the legs
integrated into the frame or underneath
the frame we're part of a sub frame
we're not sure yet and then they're
gonna be 21 inches long on the sides and
we're gonna have a single little scent
of 2x2 wood here going through the
middle trying to get this thing
structurally sound so that it can
support multiple pcs because that's
exactly what we're gonna do is put
multiple pcs on these desks and have
streaming gaming setups and rendering
editing setups on the opposite side so
we've got a lot to do I'm gonna see
what Home Depot will do for us what
they'll cut these aren't too difficult
to do and Beau's dad actually is a
pretty sweet woodworker from what it
sounds like so he can refine any of the
rough cuts that they may do at Home
Depot so we're gonna go to the store
right now check out some of the wood
they have maybe check out some
countertops to some cheap cheap ones if
we can find some that they can cut for
us and see if we can put two desks
together for the new studio the be quiet
dark Bass Pro 900 white edition is the
definition of both function and form
wireless charging case inversion and
insane water cooling Headroom make it
one of a kind or one of 2,000 because
that's all be quiet
offering click the link in this video's
description for more details
dude this is sick it's already oh man
feel that that feels so good
$35 that's pine your pine board look at
all that wood it's an extra four by
fours you serious oh yeah I'm sure
people are gonna be watching this video
thinking like are they seriously
considering a four by four for a leg of
a desk but I mean hey if you want
rigidity you know and like structural
integrity go with them wider feet yeah I
don't know just an option so we would
need longer than this unless we just did
to eight feet desks we could just cut
them down too
yeah we could just do eight feet desks
we would we wouldn't be able to go with
anything longer than that unless we
wanted to separate the desks themselves
under like separate panels
it looks like the thickest they're gonna
make these is about three quarters of an
inch yeah yeah it's a white top here
it's just like this is this wood it was
like like a plasticy oh yeah it's like a
composite way to go yeah but look how
much it's already in extending yeah
thirty yeah that's not what you want no
we have to go the wood this feels good I
like dude feel this this is nice here
but melamine Mike that's what most destr
made it this is the 3/4 by 49 by oh they
do this is yeah 97 inches
yeah well that's 96 was 8 feet so it's
still gonna be a feet
so walk with just everything then all
right so we might go with some MDF yeah
just cause it's cheaper it's still very
sturdy you can do a lot of cool things
with MDF you can cut it very easily
drilling into it though may be a little
different we're gonna have to make sure
that we have something clamping and down
so it has a split when we weight drill
into it
that's not the only thing we need to
worry about with this granted with any
tops you should be you know mindful of
that 26 bucks for one of these isn't too
bad we'll need 2 of them of course and
we're gonna have to shorten the entire
length of the desk because the biggest
handle like this we can find in Home
Depot is only 8 feet long so we were
specking it for about 10 feet but plus
you put two of us at this yeah oh yeah I
know this is like plenty like this is
huge
yeah that's true so if you have two
people working on the set you'd still
get your own space and have room to
spare
that's a good point yeah so I think I
think getting two of these will be fine
so that's gonna put us at about fifty
fifty two dollars just for the top
pieces now we're gonna have to figure
out what we want to use for the frame
for the legs hey it's good hey how you
doing sir
cuz I'm gonna need some stuff cut in a
nutshell I'm looking to build two desks
okay just computer desks nothing too
complicated
yeah would it be possible to first off
could you cut a 2x4 and a half or two by
two two of those okay okay so we're
gonna build a frame out of two by twos
then yeah and then we're gonna have legs
which is two by fours there
yeah melamine melamine and then we have
MDF which would be better for like a top
like a they're both pretty smooth but
like we're looking for the top of the
desk and we got a drill obviously what
is it gonna get not one at all the empty
air is okay but it's awful heavy okay
okay
melamine thin I figure the small feet
this is in India Teddy I mean we got set
up pieces you think half an inch would
be thick enough for a top piece of a
desk or a desk okay it's gonna be 8 feet
by about 2 feet to vyi
yeah how much stuff
maybe up to 200 pounds it was pilot I'd
say yes with this I don't know what the
strength of the half-inch would be you
know that's true foot but you going 8
feet long right right
how much support you could have in the
middle well we'll have one cross and
cross in the middle that's what we're
thinking
Oh something like that so this is a
topic looking down a Soviet actually
look at two by four well we want to keep
it all in one piece yeah by men as far
as the brace yeah be half way yes yeah
but we'll have two legs here we're
thinking one in the back yeah yeah okay
you think it's getting a half inch would
work for that or you go safe and plate
the reporter I think should do it okay
if not put another brace in between yeah
just laying a load of oil that way okay
that's a good boy yeah that's easy
yeah okay okay that's fair hey said that
makes it cheaper anyways yeah bye to
those dunes okay well actually you know
it's thinking depending on how wide it
is you might use well those were eight
by four feet over there yeah if we just
cut it in half and just use not always
yeah just by one sheet no matter what
yeah that's good 24 respect for 21
inches extra yeah maybe you want extra
which we can do that at my dad's house
for that so it cut a little further now
first and then sight the first okay guys
to watch long okay yeah I go bigger in
that won't give you the hundred hitches
I give you 96 right now that's yeah
that's fine yeah okay let us some revise
the dimensions real quick and we'll
already have them right thank you sir
appreciate it
we have to shorten the length dimension
so that the depth will also actually
have to widen because we're gonna cut
basically the way that the sheets come
for the top of the desk they come in 8
by 4-foot dimensions which means that if
we cut it directly in half and save
ourselves the trouble of buying two
sheets just to make them very exact
we'll just cut it down the middle we'll
have a 24 foot depth for the desk which
is fine I mean really it's kind of short
then 8 feet long so 96 inches that way
okay so we've adjusted the dimensions
now for the specs that they have in shop
so now we're gonna have ten two by fours
at 30 inches a piece those are the legs
we're gonna have four two by twos at 22
inches for the depth of the frame and
then four two by two by 90s for the
length of the frame and then six support
beams in the middle because the frame is
2 inches thick we have to adjust on both
sides for 18 inches for the depth of
those little frames in the middle now
we're gonna have one large MDF 4-foot by
8-foot slab cut down the middle long
weighs four to two foot by 8 foot cuts
those are gonna comprise the tops of the
desk I'm gonna have one temper -
hardwood just something cheap in the
back cut down the middle as well so that
we can cover up all the cables down at
the back and the bottom of desks
look at that would baby cuz it stole my
goodness guys like my would he like his
would okay these people are looking down
here
so we have our wood cut down the sides
we have the screw lengths that we
believe we need we have the screws here
I think we're ready to start at least
just roughly assembling everything yeah
full sand and polish or whatever we feel
like we need to do after the fact all
right so uh we walked out of the store
paying 7650 or all the wood including
the cuts and the nails these discs just
by the dimensions a little bit of cost
hundreds of dollars but obviously we're
not including labor or power tools so
assuming you have power tools you're
gonna take up a job like this and
assuming you're willing to put maybe two
or three days worth of work into it
eight hours peace out and 24 hours or so
then you can get yourself some really
sweet desks built to spec for less than
a hundred bucks in hardware its top he's
a lying rid of chick-fil-a yeah let me
get an eight-count chicken nugget meal
with a high C please I'd be a high C so
we got the wood we're back at my place
and we've got Greg sanding it down in
here forget sanding the wood down
getting ready
got it all on here the tabletop that's
going to be the support underneath
through some of the legs right there
we'll get you updated a little bit but
this is for now let's see what you look
like in just a little while
how's it looking all right so we
finished the first frame for the first
disk and see it's decent that's where I
stepped on it you're not gonna see any
of that's under the desk anyway no and
we might decide to put more of these
middle beams here from left to right
maybe one down this side and one down
the center of that side just to make it
a bit more sturdy but both you like hole
it up in the middle there may be like a
shot from far behind this is uh what its
gonna look like from underneath and that
looks pretty sweet the MDF is very
sturdy and the frame itself you can hold
from the middle wave it around it's not
gonna flex or anything yeah so I think I
think this is a good design considering
we just kind of went with it after about
20 minutes of prepping exactly so we
sanded it we got the screws in and we're
gonna take it from here probably at the
end of the week so stay tuned for that
I'd like to thank Bo Bojangles hi
Bojangles on YouTube MoMA tagged his
YouTube channel down boy plays a lot of
cool games on YouTube
down below bow is gonna be a lot more
involved with the channel here soon and
we're gonna talk about some cool stuff
I'm gonna be starting up as well so with
that thanks for watching let's build a
desk as boring as that sounds I think
it's really cool to see this kind of
like I don't know just as a professional
I yeah yeah so eventually this will be
underneath our computers our test
benches our gaming setups and our
editing rigs stay tuned for more stuff
like this this is science studio
everyone thanks for building with us
like a boss
