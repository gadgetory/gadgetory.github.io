computer the word dates back to 1613
actually and was used to describe a
person who was skilled in carrying out
calculations in World War two these
computers were no longer people but
complex machines their abilities to be
reprogrammed and thus repurposed made
them versatile reliable investments for
both the public and private sectors of
world economies this essentially made
computers empty shells for programmers
with endless possibilities insight and
video games were no exception first I
want to define the term videogame
because there are several definitions
out there and not all of them are
frankly true I'll be using Merriam
Webster's definition an electronic game
in which computers control images on a
television or computer screen a video
game that can be played on a computer
will be regarded as a computer game the
first known game to be implemented onto
a computer was birdie the brain which
was a tic-tac-toe simulator it was built
by Joseph Cates a Canadian engineer he's
also famous for his automated traffic
signalling system the world's first
birdie the brain was developed in 1950
and presented at the Canadian National
Exhibition the same year it featured a
unique editor on tube and a large grid
of lights used to display the circles
and exes
I personally regard this as the first
quote-unquote videogame on a computer
because it was the first to have a
visual display even though technically
the display wasn't a television or
monitor other games before it used
printers to inform players of current
progress and thus don't qualify as video
games I should also note at this point
that the cathode ray tube amusement
device was invented three years prior to
birdie the brain but was never actually
made commercially available nor
presented to the public it also did not
run on a computer but rather an analog
oscilloscope these points by definition
eliminate the CRT amusement device from
the list of candidates for the first
video game the next game on our timeline
is a Nimrod it was a computer game built
by Ferranti and engineering equipment
firm the video game was again a
competition between an artificial
intelligence of sorts and the player and
featured a light bulb display as well
not a screen which would have been based
on a cathode ray tube at the time that
distinction belongs to the games of
checkers and tic-tac-toe programs
developed by Christopher Stracci and
Alexander Douglas respectively both of
whom were British computer scientists
one thing that these four games have in
common is the fact that each was
invented not for the purpose of gaming
believe it or not but for the purpose of
showcasing the backbones the computers
on which they ran by 1961 new super
advanced computers featuring faster RAM
and fancy new transistors for faster
encoding were becoming widely available
to college campuses which would prove to
be the birthplaces for many video games
to come students at MIT were gifted a
computer with a point plot monitor known
as the PDP one and give an open and
unlimited access to its resources
leave it to college students to invent
the video game in their spare time by
1962 the soon-to-be famous space war was
born the video game centered on a battle
between two spaceships and used a
controller the students built themselves
needless to say the game was met with
unrivaled success as CRT slowly became
staples and household so too did space
for this spark of the college gaming age
a time during which college students all
across the planet programmed both simple
and complex games for the computers they
were slowly gaining more and more access
to without a doubt a PC gaming is where
it all started did you did you guys see
those things by 1970 something known as
TTL of transistor to transistor logic
made it possible to integrate multiple
transistors into the same microchip for
reference a single Xeon Broadwell EP
chip contains over seven billion
transistors we've come a long way but in
the 1970s these increased transistor
counts and decreased costs of production
eventually made them viable for arcade
gaming when designers began
incorporating screen speakers and
interactive control pads into single
game cabinets these were regarded as
coin-operated arcade games and will not
be discussed in this video since they
were built without the intent of ever
being reprogrammed or repurposed or used
for an entirely different purpose
altogether
games program on software the current
standard and perhaps most noteworthy of
those that existed during the 1970s was
Colossal Cave adventure it was a puzzle
and adventure game that became an icon
for the personal computer market these
kinds of games featured minimal graphics
and were typically text-based believe it
or not in which the player would simply
respond and interact with a chain of
text program into the game's code in
1975 gunfight was released in Japan as
the first official computer game to take
advantage of the microprocessor rather
than hardwired circuits and transistors
of the latter decade it was also the
first game to depict human to human
combat
Call of Duty fans of battlefield fans it
was distributed to arcade gaming
cabinets and its source code was
simultaneously implemented into various
micro computers which is why it's still
on this list all in this segment with an
interesting take on the upturn and
computer gaming at the turn of the
decade savvy computer programmers were
very open about sharing game code any
computer that could be programmed could
essentially play any game whose source
code was made public in fact certain
magazines were known to reveal entire
game code so the programmers could play
them on their personal machines it's a
bit like torrenting except you're doing
all the work and it wasn't illegal at
the time they also fostered the sharing
of newly developed game code to help
stimulate the PC gaming community so
what awaits us in the next segment of
this series well plenty of market
crashes bankruptcies and successes for
sure but perhaps most importantly plenty
of competition if you like this segment
of the series give the video a thumbs up
give it a thumbs down if well you know
you hate everything about life click a
subscribe but if you haven't already
stay tuned for a future PC build here on
the channel as well as part two of this
series
this is science to do thanks for
learning with this
