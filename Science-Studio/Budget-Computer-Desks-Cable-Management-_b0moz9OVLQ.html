rough video here just gonna be showing
you some of the things that I use in the
studio right now and not gonna talk
necessarily about the tech though it's
about what supports the tech the stuff
underneath the stuff behind the scenes
that you don't really see on camera
because I don't want you to see that
stuff on camera talking specifically
about cables so how I manage my cables
the fact that you can't see really
anything hanging down except for the
stuff that's plugging directly into the
wall or into a surge protector and then
also the desks that I use these are not
IKEA desk like a lot of the bigger tech
tubers use I actually bought these off
of Amazon so I'm going to give you a
kind of a detailed review if you will of
stuff that's not really tech related but
again has a lot to do with the tech that
I show off here in the studio and use
everyday so stay tuned we're gonna start
first with the tables and we're gonna go
underneath so I can show you how I
managed everything cable wise
so again starting off with the desks
these are from a company called tribe
signs and I've actually used them the
passion fact in this video right here I
put together a black version of this
desk here and I actually bought two of
them because I just wanted more space I
wanted to have at least two pcs up and
running so I could use one maybe it's a
streaming build and then another one for
like my editing slash gaming workstation
so I can be a little more versatile in
here and sometimes I'm not the only one
working out of here so it is nice to
have two and two desks is definitely the
pair minimum for two pcs that gives me
just enough space left over to kind of
fill me so this is typically where I
film most of my videos on the channel
and this gives me enough space to build
and stuff I'd like to have more room
this is only like a 10 by 10 or an 11 by
11 room so it's not very big hopefully
when we move into a house by this time
maybe next year I'll have a much bigger
room out of which to work and then I
have the closet over here and that has
all the hardware inventory and all that
good stuff but anyway onto the desks
again these are actually fairly simple
to put up there are only about a hundred
or so US dollars each which is pretty
cheap for desks especially you know when
you talk about furniture any kind of
furniture really they can get pretty
expensive but these aren't too bad and
they're very well built very sturdy and
that's thanks in large part to the metal
feet underneath so you can see the way
these work when you set them up each leg
or each little beam will have a number
and the instructions included will show
you which numbers to connect to which in
a certain order you have these these
little screws you actually like bolts
that keep everything together and then
you have feet that are actually slightly
raisable numb which is cool so you can
screw these in or out a little further
to either increase or lower the height
of the desk maybe you have like a room
that's slightly lopsided or maybe just
part of the desk you notice is leaning
then you can adjust either one or all of
the leg Heights to kind of smooth things
out a bit so you can see the frame
extends all the way under now it's hard
to see I'm gonna try to brighten it up
just a little bit here there we go
metal beams all the way across and a
really cool thing about this debt
because this is an l-shaped desk right
so a lot of l-shaped desks will have
something like right here like another
Legg just to support that corner but you
can see I have maybe a fifty pound
computer there and there's no need for a
leg because of the way I designed it and
like little cross beams there they keep
everything supported in the corner which
means you can freely kind of move all
the way around the desk and I'll have to
worry about hitting a random leg
sticking right there in the middle all
in all I'd say probably about 30 minutes
or so worth of setting up per desk which
isn't too bad I have the kind of oak
finish here this is just particle board
like it's nothing super fancy again
you're only paying about a hundred bucks
for these but I like this finish a lot I
went with a black finish before and it
was okay but it was you know very easy
to see scratches and dents and stuff and
I build on these desks so they can get
kind of messy they can get pretty
scratched up fairly easy again fairly
cheap finish but it looks decent
especially on camera so that's kind of a
budget solution for those interested in
saving especially you know on the
furniture side these are I think pretty
good and viable options for anybody
looking to just build a simple little
office setup without spending tons of
cash by the way if you want something
other than this color or black they also
offer them in a slightly different wood
finish you can get these in white I
believe and even a darker wood color so
plenty of options to choose from they're
all linked down below if you're
interested they are affiliate linked so
it gives me a small kickback if you buy
anything from those links I do
appreciate it otherwise just trying to
kind of share some of the stuff I use
and why is it because I'm not interested
in spending thousands of dollars on
desks either and frankly I don't have
the time anymore to build desk like I'd
like I'd done in the past so we're just
gonna stick with what we have for the
time being I think I'll actually end up
taking these to the new house as well if
we again move into one this time next
year so that's that those are the desks
again from tribe signs I have two of
them one thing I do want to mention
before we move on to the cable
management is that the l-shape is not
reversible so if you notice if I get
really far back here this side is
slightly shorter than this side and you
can traverse those two I mean
technically you can but you don't want
to otherwise you're going to have
these little routing holes here exposed
on top this would normally be flipped
upside down right because this piece
would would go here and then yeah anyway
backwards so I actually kind of drilled
pilot holes into the opposite side and
then I have the bolts coming from the
bottom so that's what holds everything
in place
the only reason I had to do it like this
is because the longer sides wouldn't
work that it would basically extend the
second desk way further back to about
here and that would be me next to no
room for the camera setup and I wanted
some space back here for extra storage
and whatnot so that's why I did what I
did again you don't really notice this
is the only spot and I can really cover
this up with maybe like a mouse pad or
something and the others are covered up
I like the monitor and the computer so
you want to do that it's possible you
need some power tools but like I said
pretty versatile I drilled right through
those things and they're still holding
up fairly strong now onto the cable
management this is a little weird for me
to film I'm literally laying on the
floor but these are cable routing
sleeves they're j-shaped and I'll show
you some up-close b-roll shots here now
basically these have the potential to
house tons of cables I'd say upwards of
a dozen and lets me pretty jam-packed
them but it will keep all of your cables
against the underside of your desk which
means you won't see any of them hanging
down and that is just such an annoying
thing it's a pet peeve of mine it's it's
one of the only I guess downsides of a
desk like this is the fact that it
really has no there's no back wall right
so anything hanging down behind the desk
is just gonna be exposed to everybody
everywhere so that that's why I bought
these and I think they really come in
handy they're not expensive at all the
only issue is because these are so thick
they're made of a really thick plastic
and they have an adhesive already pre
attached you're gonna have to cut these
if they're too long by default you need
to use a dremel or so that's why I use a
dremel to cut these down to size so that
they actually fit underneath in between
the frames of the desk on either side so
I have one there and then I have a
shorter one on this side and then
another short one on this side and
that's how I keep all of my cables in
check and if you see
even if we go you know I level I'll fix
that on them what that is
or does that it's bothering me but I
level basically nothing right no cables
and I love that that is so satisfying
sorry about the focus this camera it's
really thrown off when I bump ISO above
400 yeah
so that that's also very important for
me on camera I want to keep cables as
hidden as possible and things are
looking pretty good right now the
adhesive is very strong these have been
on the undersides of the desks for weeks
and they haven't come down at all but if
those are not gonna be enough for you
let's say you have just a few tiny
cables as well you need those in special
places something else like I want to
show you guys is this kind of clip right
here so this style clip a very simple
same thing adhesive it's not a strong mo
so if you if you run a ton of cables
through these they might detach even
from a metal base but you can see these
are just a simple little lock mechanism
just slides in you can pry it back out
if you want to add more cables or remove
them and these are especially good for
smaller cables that's actually what I'm
using over there we have like the
keyboard of the mouse cable kind of
running behind and I didn't want those
hanging either so I used some of these
to keep those in check and these are
actually pretty cheap as well again
there's plastic they're very affordable
you can get quite a number of these for
like 10 or 20 bucks so I'm also gonna
link these along with those J cable
management whatever you want to call
them cable sleeves down below in the
video description it's really what I
wanted to show you guys in this video or
those two or three things because those
can make or break but a setup right if
you see cables just hanging down behind
that's not appealing nobody wants to see
that and that's that's why I invested
again maybe like 50 bucks in total for
the cable stuff and then the desks were
about a hundred 150 bucks each so I
think that these go a long way for the
money I think they're great value and
when done right with cable combs cable
sleeves you can really just really step
up your your set up game so let me know
you guys think the comments below again
just a rough little video here showing
you guys some of the stuff that I use if
you want to see anything else
behind-the-scenes kind of vlog style I
will be more than happy to do that these
videos are pretty easy to make but
hopefully this saves you a few bucks and
gives you some ideas for your setup as
well see you guys in the next video this
is science studio thanks for checking
