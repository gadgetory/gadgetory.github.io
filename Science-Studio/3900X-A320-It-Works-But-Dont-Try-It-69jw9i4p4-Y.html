board I actually gave this to will for a
small project he was taken care of back
at his place this is the gigabyte a 320
M s2h we reviewed it in a dedicated
video check it out right here but I do
have an IR thermometer now so we're
gonna be able to track the erm temps as
we put this motherboard and the chip
we're gonna put in it the 3900 X under
load so we'll be able to see just how
hot this thing gets when it tries to
handle a 12th Corps and the way we can
get it to handle 12 cores by flashing a
new BIOS this is the f40 BIOS that
gigabyte has listed on their website for
this model board and you can see it says
it's an update for a 3rd gen AMD Rison
CPU full support and the only real
downside to flash in this pass is that
you're gonna lose Bristol Ridge support
which is like the Athlon the a-series AP
use like if you're rocking something
that old I really don't think you're
gonna be dabbling with a 3900 X anyway
so you know you're trading off something
that's likely not to be used in the
first place if you have a CPU of this
caliber granted I highly doubt anyone
with a 1300 X is gonna want to pair it
with an a320 board this is purely
because I'm curious and that's it I also
want to see how hot we can get the arms
here I also don't care this board dies
because it's super cheap so yeah let me
be the guinea pig you guys don't don't
copy this
figure by its XIII 90 horas pro packs
the necessities and more for next night
gen Intel rig boasting a properly
doubled 12+1 phase power solution
stylish aesthetic with built-in
backplate dual BIOS eight fan hubs the
list goes on
click the link below to learn more so if
we're using Q flash utility to update
the BIOS make sure you have updated BIOS
to f/32 before f40 you can see f/32 is
this one here that improves q-flash
compatibility and improve USB device
compatibility that's really it I don't
see any other need to update here
sometimes there's like a multi-step BIOS
update process I'm not seeing that but
worst case we'll play around it for sure
we're gonna try to update to F 32 first
and then see if it will take F 40 as is
by the way if maybe we're asking for the
model of this keyboard it's really cheap
like 15 20 bucks I've linked in the
description I only use it for when I'm
troubleshooting like on they go like
this
so it's wireless it's easy to you know
work with the USB 2 or 3 and prevents me
from having just that many more cables
to work with and I can walk around with
it so that's why I use it alright we're
gonna power it on there we go and we're
gonna hop into the BIOS so we can flash
it alright so we're in the Q flash
window and we're going to update the
BIOS click enter you can see we have two
BIOS is listed want to update to F 32
first so we'll click that one alright
and we're now on the F 32 BIOS we're
going to update again to a 40 and again
don't turn off power while this is
updating and alright so we're in Windows
I like booting into the OS when we're
doing things like this just to make sure
that everything is stable and we do need
to update video drivers but I'm not
going to do that until we swap CPU so
let's go ahead and take out the 70
hundred X throw in the 3900 X and see if
this PC even posts this is the 3900 X so
every good bit that's down there
I'll set up connect power supply again
power that on let's see see if it works
power cycling few times risin will do
this someone mentioned that it's gonna
train the memory I'm trying to tweak
timings stuff to make it stable not sure
if this board is gonna do that too many
times but we'll definitely be patient
with it and we'll see how long it's last
alright we have a post folks and we can
get the spinning circles yeah we got the
spinning circles okay so we're in we're
in probably gonna update a few drivers
didn't even do that okay
I didn't update drivers at all and we're
in the operating system so this is the
Fluke 62 max ir thermometer and you can
see it's got a little trigger on the
back whenever we hold the trigger down
you can see that laser shows up on the
keyboard over there and that is
indicating where we're pointing that's
where the temperature measurements are
being taken so right now what 27.6 see
updates to every tenth degree celsius
and we're gonna point this at the V RMS
throughout this video and see just how
hot they get under both idle and load
conditions alright so right now we are
stressing the CPU FPU and cache in is 64
engineer this bottom choke here is the
hottest I've been kind of playing around
with it trying to see where its most
toasty and right now we're around mid
70s I've seen it as high as 80 before
but honestly these temps aren't bad for
V arms like they're not terrible it
could be better but this isn't
absolutely horrid and you see if I move
to the second lowest choke that
temperature drops to I know it's hard to
get both the camera and where I'm
pointing in focused but temperatures
drop to like 40 C third lowest choke 30
C nice and cool fourth lowest choke 30 C
nice and cool - chokes up top or between
40 and 50 C for the most part and yeah
the furthest right up top is about 50 52
C check this out so you can see our CPU
temps there GP is not being stressed so
ignore that but CPU at the diode
is that lighter blue color up top 68
degrees Celsius right now that's what
the stock 3,900 X cooler which is a
pretty impressive granted burn an
open-air test bench or a makeshift test
bench musing the motherboard box but
still these temperatures I expected to
be a bit higher even at stock with the
stock cooler but it looks like looks
like the board's handling it well now
let's check curious now let's see what
our clock speeds are at stock and yeah
we are pretty low let's go to statistics
here I'm gonna swing the camera just a
little more this way and I'm gonna drop
the ISO so it's easy for you to see and
I'm gonna scroll down to clocks and yeah
so you can see our current frequencies
they're anywhere between 3.4 and 3.7
gigahertz this is lower than spec I
would expect all cores to boost to at
least 4 we saw that with our other
beefier boards
so our a320 am is definitely gimping the
3900 X right now and this is one of the
reasons why you don't want to pair a 400
or 500 ollar CPU with a $50 motherboard
the CPU could definitely boost higher
than 3.6 gigahertz
the board is not allowing it to and the
reason why it's not allowing it to is
because the board knows that it cannot
handle that kind of power delivery and
so you're seeing power kind of
alleviated here and back down as a
result of frequency that of course
requires less voltage and that means
overall power delivery has been lowered
so imma show you a few more spot tests
with our IR thermometer here we're
looking at the MOSFETs now you can see
the laser where I'm pointing
not the chokes but the MOSFETs
themselves not too hot we move further
down and temperatures actually lower so
the MOSFETs higher up are the ones that
are a bit hotter and by the way the
chokes if you are just do the chokes are
around 100 C I've been checking those
out and those get to about a hundred but
their chokes I mean these are not like
it's not really a big deal that these
are running this ha there's really
nothing inside of them it's just some
copper wire but the MOSFETs are I would
say on the higher end in terms of
temperatures but there's really there's
nothing super alarming here
honestly these temperatures aren't as
hot as I thought they would be for a
board of this caliber so again what
exactly is happening here the CPU is not
reaching t-junction it's not throttling
itself okay it is actually just fine at
70 with the exception of a few spikes
about 70 degrees Celsius under full load
in is 64 full but it's not primary five
look but still and yeah so it's not the
CPU it's the board the board knows that
it can't handle the power delivery
requirements for this 12 core and it's
rated boost frequencies it's within spec
boost frequencies right this boosts up
to four point what 4.6 gigahertz we're
nowhere close to that granted we
shouldn't expect to be at four point six
all core that's not what max boost means
but not even I mean we're not even at
four gigahertz and we were at least at
that with the I believe that be 450 we
hit that and be 450 I've tested it you
guys haven't seen the video yet but B
450 is just fine as well as X 470 and
x-37b I expect to be just as good as X
470 assuming power delivery standards
are in check you might have a few again
X and P conflicts and things of that
sort I'm not sure about PTO being
included in those new BIOS revisions
presenters support I'll check that out
I'm sure others have already
investigated it but for now I can
certainly tell you I could have told you
this before we ran this test that Avery
20 is not a recommended chipset for a 12
core or $500 105 or so watt TDP chip
just the board can't handle it and again
the relationship is because the board
cannot handle the power delivery
requirements it lowers frequency and
when you lower frequency you can lower v
core you can lower voltage to the CPU
that of course lowers total power draw
which keeps this board relatively within
spec I wouldn't say 102 degrees Celsius
is all that comfortable for VR em temps
but at least I mean at least it works
like if anything the one positive you
can take from this is that you do have
support like AMD's promise of platform
support socket support through 2020 at
this point looks to be a reality if you
can get these chips to run on boards
that emmitt that md didn't even say
we're gonna be supported then that says
a lot about the the socket it does aim
for is an incredibly versatile socket
and I'm really surprised that you might
even included support present too with
these a320 boards I'm assuming they
expected you to use a much lower TDP
chip so maybe like a 3,600 would have
worked for this board I don't know for
sure but the TDP certainly suggests that
it would so with the exception of a few
things you're forgoing like overclocking
you probably could get this to work on a
six core on a low TDP six core should
say but for now yeah don't do this with
an expensive Zen - chip thank you guys
for watching if you want to leave a
comment be sure to do so comment
sections right below here and yes stay
tuned for more cool experiments our Navi
reviews are coming up very soon I have
been I've been trying to get all that
stuff compiled but we've got like six
graphics cards we're you know we're
doing the typical will graphics for
benchmarks so that takes some time the
good thing is you on the swap platforms
it's just a card in and out install new
drivers and good to go so anyway yeah
I'll catch you next one thanks for
watching this is science video and
thanks for satisfying your morbid
curiosity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
