back-to-basics build now what I mean by
that is that this build will not be
custom cooled so we're just gonna keep
things air-cooled nice and simple we're
gonna cool everything with the h7 quad
Lumi from cry rig one of the key
components of this build although none
of this stuff is necessarily sponsored a
lot of it was sent to me but they're not
you know no one's paying me to make this
video or to use any of their components
the EVGA 1070 TI it's a heck of a car
it's gonna game like a boss we have an
8700 K from Intel pretend there's a box
there the motherboard power house is an
asus rog Maximus 10 Hero this is one of
the best Z 370 boards you can buy for
any intel chip out there it's gonna look
sweet it's gonna keep overclocks nice
and steady
up there around 5 gigahertz and it also
has of course our to be support and you
actually have it set out right here you
can just take a look at it
mmm check it out for ram we've got 4 or
4 gig sticks of course their Dominator
Platinum's he's run a 3,000 megahertz
and I like that there are four of them
because we fill up all four slots a huge
pet peeve of mine it sounds like it
think it's seriously a first-world
problem but I hate having two of those
four dimm slots empty so I would prefer
to I'll fill them up with 4 4 gig sticks
and that's exactly what we have here
from Corsair these look beautiful by the
way
these silver metallic fins up top are
gonna complement the motherboard a very
nice now to the left here we have a
three sound that makes three fans two of
them are 140 s1 is 120 so this one go
out the rear and these two will go up
front and I'm emphasizing a silence
factor here because I will be again
video editing quite a bit I don't want
to hear my PC spool up when things get
pretty hot inside these will keep
everything nice and quiet these would
really be the only fans in the system
apart from the one with the h7 now the
power supply another overkill factor for
sure you could run this entire system by
the way on maybe like a 500 watt power
supply even less actually I've run this
on a 400 watt PSU before comparable
systems so a thousand watts is
definitely overkill but I want to stay
well within our efficiency curve in fact
we might be slightly inefficient you
know on the lower end where things start
to taper off it's very difficult for a
PSU to supply a small amount of power
and it's difficult for a PSU to supply a
large amount of power relative to its
wattage rating so this is probably a
little too much but it's gonna stay
super quiet I love these P two power
supplies from EVGA and I've got custom
sleeve cables from cable mod 2 so things
are gonna look sweet inside for storage
we have an XP g basically a data 512 gig
m2 SSD this is a piece
I you based SSD so it's gonna run pretty
fast I think we're looking at around
what do we have here I think it's I
think it's one gig reads and then maybe
something like five or six hundred
megabytes right anyway it's gonna be
really fast faster than your traditional
SATA m2 or SATA just generic SSD and
this is my first one actually that's
PCIe base so I'm really excited to see
if you know there's gonna be any
substantial difference between this
speed when it comes to boot times you
know program loading times so we'll test
that out and then we also have a one
terabyte WD blue which is just a you
know all-around sweet hard drive for the
price gives you plenty of storage for
games and the like and lastly the house
for all of our components will be the
fractal design a mesh if I see mainly
because this is one of my favorite cases
of all time it's not gonna break the
bank by any means and actually because
this is the mesh if I see right so it's
got the front airflow priority or with
that little mesh paneled front this
actually comes with a transparent like
you know not tinted temper glass panel
now as an option so fractal being as
cool as they are decided to switch up
the traditional approach right so the
mesh device he originally came with a
dark tempered glass panel some people
like that I don't they offer you the
option now to pair it with a you know
not tinted panel I guess I should say so
I very cool that they give you that
option and to be honest I rip this from
the define CTG but whatever just pretend
I got all this in one package so without
further ado we're gonna start building
this thing and then maybe we'll run some
benchmarks just so you guys get an idea
of yeah the kind of computational power
at our disposal now
so a few things I want to address in
this video you might be thinking to
yourself Greg why did you choose the
8700 K if you were praising the 2700 X
for being one of the best all-around
CPUs out there and calling the 2600 X
and 2600 the best value CPUs on the
market you're praising Rison but you're
choosing Intel what what's what's going
on there why aren't you practicing what
you preach and there's one very good in
my opinion reason for choosing the 8700
K the answer has to do with content
creation more specifically Adobe
Premiere Pro and its built-in quick sync
function which by default is disabled
probably because not all CP is out there
have integrated graphics processors and
that's exactly what quick sync requires
so it's basically a shift from software
encoding to a hardware encoding there
are some compromises we'll talk about
that in the dedicated video but for now
that is my upfront big reason for
choosing the 8700 K over the 2,700 X
which mind you does not have an
integrated graphics processor really the
only CP from Intel I can make a case for
right now is the 8700 K possibly the
8400 i5 it's a six core lock variant
which when paired with a B through 16
motherboard is a pretty decent value
proposition sometimes it outperforms you
know even the 2700 X in games right
which is a more expensive CPU but you're
limited to just that scenario and I
don't like limiting myself I don't like
telling people look if you're gonna just
game get the CPU because that might not
be all that you do within a year or so
is time so having you know a CPU with
multi-threading enabled and that
overclocking support as well will give
you a more future-proofed
future that that really didn't come out
right see I kind of seems like I'm
playing both sides of the coin right I'm
trying to coax up to the blue team and
the red team and both of their fan bases
they're extreme right and left wings
right but that's not really my goal I've
pissed off fan bases on both sides
before and that's not you know I don't
need that kind of like just bloodthirsty
devotion from fans on my channel I want
people to come to this channel with an
open mind and and to be able to accept
multiple
it's a view based on use case scenarios
because not everyone is the same in my
case the 8700 K I think is gonna be the
better bet for me if it's not I'll
gladly go back to the 2,700 X I have no
problem with that but for now I'm gonna
try this out I'm gonna try the quick
sync option and I will come back to you
guys in a dedicated video to discuss my
findings and maybe talk to Dmitry from
hardware conducts a bit more and see
what he thinks about the whole thing
after he's got his testing done as well
I'm gonna end the video with a few more
shots of the build being that it's only
air-cooled right through and through I
think it's one of my better pcs just
from an aesthetic standpoint because of
first off these cables again from cable
mod I'd reuse the same kit probably
three or four times because I love the
power supply first off from EVGA and I
love the way that these cables look and
pretty much any build being that they're
primarily black which basically matches
everything I love how quiet the system
is thanks to the silent wings tree fans
I love the case the mesh up I see and I
really like this crier rig cooler here
the h7 quad Lumi looks great with really
anything but it definitely complements
the metallic and I a chrome which
accents of the asus rog board definitely
one of my favorite boards on the z 370
chipset for sure you can find all these
parts by the way linked in the
description below if you want to build
something similar with that let me know
what you think about the build in the
comments below be sure to give this
video a thumbs up again thought it was
cool thumbs down or the opposite you
