the same as its non elite counterpart
and that's a good thing
NZXT is stuck to the if it ain't broke
don't fix it mentality for quite some
time and it served them well in the PC
market perhaps the most substantial
change the transition from scratchy
flimsy acrylic to beautiful tempered
glass it's a trend that's been catching
on lately and it's great to see the s340
on board the panel is held in by four
thumb screws with rubberized bottoms the
entire skeleton of the case can be seen
through a glass with only the outer
edges covered with a layer of black trim
however seeing as though the remainder
of the cases exterior is white I would
love to see this in white for the sake
of consistency
another grand change much of the elites
insides now match its exterior black on
black and in this case white on white
save the rear panel other differences
with the white elite include a matte
finish rather than a glossy one a
front-mounted SSD tray with two
additional cutouts down below and an
extra pair of USB 2.0 ports up top along
with an HDMI out for cards the VR
compatibility hub support apart from
these key differences however the s340
elite is mainly an S 340 and I cannot
emphasize enough how great that really
is so now that the key differences have
been pointed out let's take a minute or
two for some solid tech porn oh and some
good music
you can have this version of the NZXT
s340 elite or either of its darker
variants for roughly 100 US dollars
which i personally think is a great
price I never hesitated to buy the
regular s340 for around 70 to 80 bucks
numerous times and I wouldn't hesitate
with this purchase either it's a
no-brainer in my book if looks are a top
priority as they should be it's your
personal computer so why not show it off
a bit with a tempered glass NZXT s340
