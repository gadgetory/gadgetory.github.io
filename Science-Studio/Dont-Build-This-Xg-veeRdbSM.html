right here
McLovin came by a couple of weeks ago
and dropped off his severe healed system
ended up upgrading it we'll talk about
that in a separate video but in this one
I want to look at his old hardware
particularly the FX 8320 II and its
viability in 2018 / 2019 the answer is
don't build with the cpu unless you can
get it for 20 or so dollars and I'm not
joking I'll show you why but first we're
going to build the system and then we'll
run our benchmarks now the motherboard
that we purchased a micro Center
along with the CPU because we got like a
$30.00 discount when we bundled them
that's what I suggest you do if you live
next to a micro Center is this gigabyte
FX or 990 FX motherboard so you go with
970 or 990 FX this is an older style
board you get that just from the fact
that there's a distinct North and South
Bridge today's motherboards for the most
part are all handled on a single chip
down here there would be just a chipset
but in this case we have two unique
chipsets and that's just because not
everything was unified by this point in
time now you can see we're pretty
stacked here on the VRMs so this is one
of those overclocking boards I mean you
could really overclock with even 970 but
these nine and a FX boards were more
popular for cpus like the I think it was
called a 95 90 CPUs that came out of the
box with the you know a frequency of
over 4 gigahertz the 8320 ii was not the
best overclocker no it's actually
slightly less powerful just in terms of
clock speeds than the 8350 which was the
one that a lot of people use this was
the technically a fork or partially
multi-threaded CPU AMD was selling these
as eight cores we have more on that
separate video but for all intents and
purposes AMD was selling these eight
core chips so that's why a lot of people
jumped onto these they were pretty cheap
at the time I think we got this for a
hundred bucks
Jacob felt pretty good about that so did
I but we're gonna find out just how well
$120 cpu from 2011 does in 2019 so we're
going to check out here on the board it
says ddr3 4 + 2
then one in three so we want to do one
and to our this slot and this slot the
little notch here is a little hot
different for ddr3 actually it's easier
to see because it's further over to one
side et or forth a bit trickier to get
used to and a snap this one in there you
have to be completely honest this is
it's not going to be a terrible system I
know I keep saying that about I'm kind
of ripping on FX at this point but I
really just don't think it's a smart
purchase choice especially if you're
gonna pay you know considerably large
sums of cash for this dated platform
yeah okay so this is basically our
entire platform CPU motherboard RAM CPU
cooler and now we can mate this to the
case this is also a fairly cheap case
for what it is
so it actually pairs nicely with the
actual hardware components of our PC
built so sound like they stand out you
know I don't have a really expensive
case with really cheap hardware so it
all kind of fits the bill so IO shield
is in for those who are new to the PC
building scene it is much easier to
install a platform when the case is
laying flat like so on a desk why is
this screw not going in so these three
cables here
I'm gonna try to get these this is the
RGB controller or the CPU cooler it
doesn't look like it's addressable
because these connections is your four
pin connections so doesn't matter either
way
we'll make it sync up as best we can now
tip for those who are in the business of
buying and selling you species there are
two things that really help sell a
system especially if it's a cheap system
the first is RGB as much as you can
without compromising on the budget it's
just how it is people like the bling and
- if you can find yourself a cheap pair
of cuffs
some cables they have to be really nice
to not to be capable on pro sleeve
cables or anything like that but just
something like this I mean you can get
these pretty chief now especially used
you can see they're not the best quality
at this point they're already starting
to fray quite a bit this will still help
it makes it look more premium than than
it actually is on a performance level so
yeah make it as ostentatious as possible
a tasteful combination of colors will go
a long way use even if it bathroom in a
beach site I mean it would but I have to
push this side all the way in that's the
problem with loading from the right side
you've wondered why cases if and general
kind of moved away from that it's
because it can be pretty tight back I'm
literally shoving this power supply and
probably embrace something dwell oak
black midnight yes I want to know how
ridiculously intense that was to get in
but we made it fit I hope none of the
cables have been cut in the process but
the power plays in there so we're gonna
move forward all right this extra cable
management with these zip ties will
excuse me tweezers is kind of
unnecessary I'm just doing this to make
it look pretty again that resell factor
yeah so we'll install the I guess we're
gonna do it maybe like a 256 gig SSD or
240 gig SSD I think a really great value
for this system being that the whole
thing is gonna cost around five to six
hundred dollars is going to be a 90 DTI
I changed my mind for a couple reasons
first off the 980ti is otech you have
extremes that we have those sag hardcore
so I would only recommend really
installing those for the vertical mod
vertical bracket and for two there's
really no red in those cards we're going
for a red theme so I think we'll go with
one of our mind our x5 70s which are
actually flash to buy
I know these are for eighties flash to
580 excuse me you can see these are a
pretty good-looking rx for eighties we
actually bought these on eBay for about
a hundred bucks apiece so if you're
looking for a use graphics card don't
mind the extra risk you know you have
eBay buyer protection guarantee things
that cover you to to a pretty good
extent then I recommend one of these
cards for starters you can also buy new
cards I know though the new rx 570 some
of those are going for as low as like
150 or so so willing some of us down
below in the video description also this
card and the rest thing the one is for
that matter although I don't recommend
you build this system because you could
get far better which we'll talk about
soon especially on the CPU side you want
to do a platform than this so let's go
ahead and install this pretty
straightforward this isn't a super heavy
card but definitely feels like there
could be some sag 8-pin supplemental VGA
power
twist it around sound good uh everything
about this build is old and clean this
up
given the build old haircut no big deal
I think it's clean looking back here I
mean for 500 ish dollar build this is
not bad at all there's custom cables go
a long way and we'll power it on run
some benchmarks alright so at this point
the video the PC boot affiant sitting
right here I've got all the red LEDs
kind of synced up here and I installed
games from Steam for benchmarking
purposes I wanted a fresh install of
Windows 10 so it's not conflict with
relatively modern drivers in the newer
am4 platform the SSD that I used was
used previously on an m4 platform so I'm
going to wipe that completely probably
not a big deal but just to be safe
the 8320 ii is a 95 watt chip and for
the test you're about to see it was
overclocked across all course the 4.5
gigahertz at one point three six volts
which is something McLovin did not want
me to do out of the box so he was
actually I think running at 4.2 the
entire time now my outlook on the
platform to this point was rather dim
and I didn't expect going into this that
I'd ever really be recommending the an 3
Plus platform ever again so we'll see
where we stand after these graphs first
up is a 3d mark firestrike with our
overclock and eight gigs of ddr3 we're
pulling in a score of 86 38
not fantastic by any means especially
when seen in the context of other lower
core count chips on the market even
Intel's Core i3 4150 which I used in my
first gaming rig nearly matches the FX
chip with the same marks for it
installed mind you and that just shows
how biased some games are to the IPC and
maybe two to four cores instead of well
quote unquote
8-year with the FX 8320 II the i5 6500
still a relatively old CPU walks all
over are eight core FX chip and yes we
venture into Rison territory since where
I am DS high core account propensity
begins to shine the r5 1400 the true
fork or a thread CPU scales up to
roughly 30% above that of our 8320 II
although in most games you'll find that
this is not the case it just again has
to do with Rises higher ie PC it's one
of the advantages of going with a newer
platform you can check out the 1600 here
AMD's first six core durations since
arguably the FX 6300 can be purchased on
Amazon for around 130 bucks an
incredible value I have videos talking
specifically about that CPU and it can
be even more incredible if purchase used
or with a board bundle at a store like
Micro Center so in this case the fx-888
when te it looks insignificant despite
its arguably competitive pricing in the
used market moving on then set a bench
tells an interesting story even with a
4.5 gigahertz all a core overclock the
8320 II managed a mere 677 CB I know
that kind of sounds decent right that's
close to a thousand CB but in today's
day and age like that's really not that
great we have rice and chips you can buy
for two to three hundred bucks at score
around 2000 CB know I even come a long
way in just a few short years put it
this way there isin 5 1400 running at
stock it's around 3.2 gigahertz scores
consistently in the upper 600 range as
well in our case falling only a few
points behind the ad t20ii now with the
3.8 gigahertz all core overclock that
score jumps by over a hundred points so
with solid overclocks the mighty 8 core
FX processor falls to a 4 core budget
offering in 2019 not that we should be
surprised but it's definitely revealing
of the true age of the FX platform so
should you consider in any case then and
I have 83 20 or 6300 for that matter
this is this is a tough one
how about games well this is
things get a bit tricky but a good rule
of thumb is that if you're looking to
build a new modern system FX CPU should
obviously be avoided at all costs you'll
be stuck running a platform using ddr3
for starters it'll also have to
overclock your cpu to match weaker rice
and chips meaning higher power draw and
thus higher rates of heat output if
however you're willing to accept those
compromises FX processors can be found
for pretty great deals online I found if
you buy it now options on eBay for
around 60 bucks which isn't too bad but
if you ask me the real value is
somewhere around 30 or 40 dollars which
I don't find too many people selling
these for I wouldn't be comfortable
paying 60 bucks for the C if you put it
that way we're talking about tech from
2012 right around that era paying
anything close to retail for something
that old and that abundant in the used
market is the definition of insanity
seeing as though we now have rise into
play with so my advice is to only buy
the CPUs used and for something close to
again 30 or 40 dollars in my opinion and
if you do decide to pick one of these up
make sure you pair it with a decent
overclocking board like our 990 FX from
gigabyte you'll find some peeps asking
for ridiculous sums of cash for some of
these on eBay but if you're diligent
you'll find something for well under 100
bucks you may even find these boards
still stocked in stores like Micro
Center where McLovin originally bought
his though he paid I think for the CPU
and the graphics card combined somewhere
around 120 240 bucks this is before
Rison came out though again a few years
ago so definitely wouldn't want to pay
that today so with solid overclocks and
most games you'll find that the FX 83
consistently trades blows with the rise
in 5 1400 believe it or not GTA 5
results in a 3 FPS disparity on average
in 1440p though the 1% low is spread out
just a bit more I should also stress
that playing in higher resolutions will
offset leverage between your CPU and GPU
making things a bit less stressed on the
former since fewer frames are drawn as a
result and these things those CPUs have
significantly less threads to work with
then graphics cards - or GPU
specifically it does help on the CPU
side to increase that resolution for
fast paced high frame rate games though
like csgo I'd stick with Intel or
horizon optimization is also something
to strongly consider so older games will
likely favour those chips with
typically higher instructions per clock
something Intel's dominated for years
we're hoping Zen to closes the gap soon
though Rison arguably already did you
won't find too big a framerate disparity
between Intel's best consumer offering
and risings best offering so like the
9900 can the 2700 acts are not too far
apart especially when you start
venturing in a 1440p and 4k territory I
also tested ashes of the singularity in
dx12 to see if any of AMD's claims
regarding core account rain true for the
newer API and compared to a proper 8
core AMD CPU the FX 8320 II fell behind
by roughly 10 FPS on average this is you
know compared to one of AMD's best CPUs
honestly not as large of disparities I
was expecting and this likely has to do
with our choice API as well as the fact
that we offset leverage by choosing to
run the GPU focus benchmark rather than
a CPU focused one so again the circles
back to the idea that if the graphics
card is stressing definitely more than
CPU it's not going to matter as much
what CPU have in there and the 8320
isn't a terrible CPU it's just known for
running pretty hot and yeah
requiring a high frequency to keep up
with today's modern offerings this trend
continues elsewhere as well titles like
Witcher 3 that heavily stressed the GPU
will run great on that X platforms in
general it's a general statement it'll
take that you know to mean that you can
play these things in 4k with like a rx
580 it's not gonna happen but you
shouldn't expect a huge difference in
framerate between an 80 through 20 in a
game like Witcher 3 and something like
horizon 5 1600 there's just not enough
of the CPU being utilized there to
really benefit the new architecture
other games however like I don't know
the Total War series universe sandbox
city skylines those will require a bit
more from individual threads in which
case Rison or copy lake should be
strongly considered instead I'll be it
or a bit more cash now I did have plans
to benchmark pub G and Crysis just for
the lawls however both games were
unstable to say the least next I don't
know why pub she consistently froze mid
game you're seeing it here leaving my
poor character completely helpless in
San Hawke the scary thing is I didn't
even you know feel like it was the
game's fault
ever run into this issue before even
though pub she's not the most optimized
game of giving it tons of crap in the
past I've never seen it do this across
the dozens of CPS up tests into this
game instead these felt like huge frame
skips depicted by long freezes followed
by quick catching up you know right
where the game had to get my character
in place in real time with the servers I
know this isn't the story for all FX
CPUs I know plenty of people still
gaming even in pub G to this very day
with FX processors but it does speak at
least to a small degree again to the age
of the platform and the demand from
modern titles so can it be done can you
viable the game on an FX 8a through 20
and 2019 even with only eight gigs of
ddr3 which was the recommended minimum
back then yeah obviously I mean even
nearly a decade later the CPUs are still
doable but they aren't preferable and by
choosing to save money now and purchase
an older platform you severely limit
yourself in terms of upgrade ability
want to move to Rison you'll need a new
motherboard CPU and RAM kit my honest
advice and I'm being dead serious here
I'm not trying to insult anybody still
using the FX platform this is just for
people trying to get into the computer
scene now spend a bit more on the
platform upfront even if it means going
for something as cheap as the rise in
514 hundred or rising three twelve
hundred even and compromise on the
graphics card why because the graphics
card is one component it's a quick swap
didi you clip out clip and install
drivers and you're good to go it's
simpler it'll likely be cheaper to do
and you can typically fetch a decent
cash for used graphics cards on sites
like eBay it's a lot harder to sell
platforms most people are looking for a
newer platform and then they'll buy an
older graphics card because again it's a
very simple thing to swap out it's just
what I would do in this predicament
you'll have to agree with me it's just
again it's my preference and my
experience with PCs it just makes more
sense to not limit yourself on a
platform level more or less on the
graphics card side instead because you
can you can work with that much easier
and with that my conclusion is this
despite the fact that the 8320 manages
to keep up with the rising 514 hundred
and several titles and despite the fact
that it can be bought for significantly
less in some cases than most of today's
current offerings I don't think you
should build this
I really don't that I mean it was fun to
film and an experiment with but going
back to my previous point a newer
platform can go a long way both in terms
of hardware support and future
durability swapping a graphics card is
easy to do they sell very well online
and you won't break the bank if you're
willing to wait a few months for prices
to move south do you agree with me or
disagree with me let me know in the
