sending us to Computex 2017
don't make it too short okay so uh we've
been walking around Taiwan trying to get
used to the city people are very
friendly here which is nice even though
we're clearly not natives they are very
helpful we've had people like turn
around and run back to us to help us to
point us in the right direction so we
found a barber shop here it's kind of a
blue mountaintop joint but a will here
is going to be the first contestant
she's going to make him look nice and
Purdy so we're in an eyesore here in
Taiwan and we're just checking out
prices what a feel expensive things are
so the conversion rate from the US
dollar this time when these dollars
about thirty to one so for every one US
dollars you get about 30 Taiwanese
dollars for a price of fifty seven
thousand nine hundred Taiwanese dollars
that's roughly two thousand dollars here
in US currency so bad but it's a
slightly more expensive I think than
followed up in the pence I'll go to the
specs here it's a little more expensive
than it would be in a safe but check it
out I get a cool Chinese keyboard sushi
what's this
it's like jello tastes like squash do
not judge us for grabbing cold stone and
pipe a diarrhea
