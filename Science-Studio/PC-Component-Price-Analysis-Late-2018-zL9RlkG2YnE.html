recently with regard to timing when
should you build a PC and the answer to
that is always changing it's kind of why
this question is so annoying did you
wait for the next big release should you
buy use now and upgrade later will
prices drop significantly for certain
parts for the next 2 or 3 months
so look as often as I hear this question
and I get this question all the time I
totally get it right you want to
maximize your utility and stretch your
dollar as far as it'll go
so today we'll analyze computer prices
on a component by component basis to
help you answer the question for
yourself let's start with CPUs on Intel
side things are a bit pricey right now
I've got a video discussing this in
detail or right here but in a nutshell
current chipsets and CPUs are being
produced from the same process a supply
shortage almost always forces prices
upward which is why even the 8700 K pre
refresh jumped in MSRP by roughly 10% if
you're dead set on an Intel upgrade path
for gaming superiority and program
dependency stick with the blue team I
can't really convince you otherwise but
if you prefer the value emphasis the
better solution in my opinion is AMD for
well under 200 bucks so the rise in 520
600 is a killer solution for
multitaskers and gamers alike rendering
CAD streaming Photoshop it can all be
done quite simply with a 6 chord 12th
red beast like this at around 4
gigahertz that's you know that's a low
conservative overclock XMP stability has
vastly improved this time around as well
so if you've got yourself a basket of
RAM you should consider the 2nd gen 12
nanometer stuff but what about future
releases should you wait for either
Intel or AMD to release something new
before you buy is it also a question I
get a lot well if you're watching this
at any point in 2018 the answer in my
opinion should be no we don't expect
true Zen to architecture at 7 animators
until mid 2019 on the other side Intel's
been struggling with its 1092 process
for quite some time partly explaining
their current supply shortage don't
expect anything in this realm until
later in 2019 we'll be left with the 9th
gen stuff for quite some time so both
the desktop CPU manufacturers won't
release anything truly groundbreaking
for what we expect will be another year
or two if you can wait that long so
but if you want something soon it makes
sense to buy now and again in my opinion
the rise in 520 600 is the best value
currently on the market motherboards
really aren't called in a question too
much with respect to timing so we'll
gloss over this one most rice and CPUs
run perfectly fine on B 350 or B 450
chipsets just mind the BIOS updates if
you're using a newer board on an older
CPU more on that in this video right
here as for Intel it's pretty straight
forward as well if you don't want to
overclock you have a non case queue then
buy the cheaper boards but if you do
have a case queue and you want to
overclock it you know you're kind of
forced to buy the Z series chipsets now
let's move over to RAM this one's tricky
prices have been on the decline as of
late but really only barely I mean up
until late 2017 prices were on the rise
of base 21 33 megahertz ddr4 kit in a
4x4 arrangement used to cost 75 bucks
boy what we do for prices like that
today currently that same kit costs
around 150 bucks nearly double what it
should cost on paper hynek's micron and
Samsung were sued multiple times by
multiple countries over antitrust
violations and long story short things
take a while in court especially big
court cases like this we don't expect
prices to return to normal several
months if not years
so if Ram was the one thing you were
waiting on before building your next
computer don't get your hopes up my
advice is to bite the bullet buy a
cheaper 16 gig kit while you can or find
something in the used market for
slightly less either way there's really
no avoiding this one it's the price we
pay literally when big businesses resort
to shady and illegal tactics now how
about those graphics cards depending on
your desired resolution and game
settings and budget the market is well
it's okay nothing special here unless
you plan on buying a used and I have
videos on that as well as for the new
stuff your sweet spot is still probably
around gtx 1070 or 1080 territory 1060 s
will do just fine but you're still
paying a bit of a premium with respect
to AMD rivals so in my opinion the RX
580 is the better buy from a value
perspective you just got to put up with
Radeon software and if you've only ever
used GeForce experience you may want to
stick with the Green Team just vered
g-forces sake it's assuming you used
experience it's just a preference thing
Turing offerings are still quite
expensive in my opinion but if you
insist on the latest tech the cheaper 20
70s at around 500 USD look rather
promising 2080s are often more expensive
than their nearly identical performing
1080i counterparts and 20 ATT eyes are
priced like Titans but I mean if you're
willing to sink your teeth into either
of those cards you probably weren't
interested in this topic anyway because
value isn't probably your top concern
and that's totally your choice
I implore you to reallocate funds if
possible in your budget toward the best
graphics card possible though especially
if you're gonna emphasize gaming GT 10
30s aren't gonna cut it for the average
gamer and I GPS are absolute last
resorts even the 22 and 24 hundred G's
just might take their cases coolers and
power supplies aren't typically topics
of concern for budget builders we did
see a small bump in power supply prices
during the mining craze but that event
was rather isolated and was quickly
corrected you can find efficient 5 and
600 watt power supply is good for a
majority of gamers with a single CPU GPU
config for well under 100 USD now I've
linked a few that I've used actually in
the past below that tends to be the
topic that people are most confused
about how much you know wattage do I
need for my system but typically 5 to
600 watts is the sweet spot now the last
thing I wanna touch on is storage this
category jumped in price across the
board actually around September of 2017
but it didn't last as long as the RAM
surged despite having similar suppliers
we actually see a correction at around
September of 2018 those dips there and
this is about where we should expect
things to be in a normal market simply
put if you were put off by storage
prices in general which is totally you
know justified at least it would have
been a year ago they shouldn't be an
excuse to not build in the present so
there are certainly variables at play
here and I've only addressed a handful
of them but the only thing costing
significantly more than it should
ultimately is a ram so if you're willing
to pay an additional 80 to 100 bucks
more for your average 16 gig kit of say
Corsair dump lots then in my opinion
you'll be able to navigate the waters
elsewhere and find great deals yes even
on those graphics cards so should you
buy a PC right now yeah i whoops I
actually think that there's enough in
the market telling you to buy that it
would be a sin not to and that's
a good thing prices will however
continue to fall as they always do for
current gen hardware so in theory the
longer you wait the more you save but
there's a 20 40 or 60 dollar premium
justify having a computer today with
which to game and create yes that's my
take let me know you think the comments
below thumbs up thumbs down you guys
know what to do click that red subscribe
