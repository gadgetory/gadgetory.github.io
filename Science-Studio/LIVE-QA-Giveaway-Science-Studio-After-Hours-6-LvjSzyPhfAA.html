make sure that I'm alive before I start
talking and be a big waste of time I'm
still waiting okay it looks like we're
about a 10 15 second delay there so
sorry about the weird pause in the
beginning I would like to make sure this
thing's start because OBS tells me one
thing and then the YouTube live control
room tells me something else and it's
hard to get them to sync sometimes so
hello everyone thank you for dropping by
this after a live stream here on science
studio
I am glad you're all here watching if
you are clicking here for the giveaway I
don't I mean I don't blame you really
you're probably wondering with the
giveaway even is it's not something
super big but I figured I would give
back to those of you who decided to
watch on a Sunday night I understand
that this is usually either a school
night or a work night right you got
stuff to do in the a.m. and I get that
so I want to kind of pay it forward a
bit to at least one lucky winner I'm
gonna give out a $50 Amazon gift card
and all you got to do is answer a simple
question like we did two weeks ago so
maybe 45 minutes into the livestream I
will ask the question and then I'll
check the chat and then the first person
to answer the question correctly will
win the $50 gift cards so I'll just send
it to you electronically you just get it
usually via email I think and you can
spend it on whatever you want really
I'll stop moving my hands around I am a
little toasty and I'm toasty because I
was at the beach today you know living
in a city where everyone else goes to
your city for spring break and that's
really it they kind of just like you
know milk you for all you're worth and
then leave again like a week later
because that's what spring breakers do
we're in the middle of that right now
so it's very packed at the beach I live
on the beach side here and it's just
it's a it's a racket it really is so
what I'm gonna do on it says Amazon
giftcard I'm out
what's up with that you don't like you
know like free cash bro I appreciate
that hunter thank you I don't know what
I do that is so entertaining for you
guys I just try to answer questions like
I don't have any format a lot of people
do like a formal thing you know they go
over news stories and stuff like that
but I just try to be as personal as
possible you guys I know you guys are
just you know you love the tech you love
learning stuff I love learning stuff
that's why I keep doing what I'm doing
on the channel most of the stuff I talk
about I learned about the day before
which is why I say thanks for learning
with us at the end of every stream and
that's that's kind of why I think the
that I still have like a hard like
passion for this for doing this because
it's kind of it's been tough lately with
the algorithms kind of reorganizing
preferences lioness literally gets
recommended after every single video of
mine and it's just the way that he
plants tags and stuff and links he'll
put links on random websites all over
the place so that YouTube prioritizes
his videos over everyone else and you
know you can do that he's big so it's
really hurting the small small channels
worse you know we're kind of in the
lower end of the middle side and yeah
I'm sunburned if you rewind to the live
stream a little bit talked about it if
you're wondering what are your thoughts
on the Facebook data leak I mean I'm not
really surprised I literally just talked
about this in a video that was like two
weeks old and so if you want to go back
and look at that Facebook does this data
collection thing all the time
so I'm not really surprised by the fact
that they've been siphoning other data
as well cell phone data in particular
let's see here dual water force g2
extended to TI for 250 AUD it's a real
deal I checked by opening CPU cooler is
it a good deal
I'll let you answer that one my man
lioness is a marketing genius yeah I
mean really what it comes down to is
just this is something that I was
talking with will about cuz we'll knows
how this stuff works behind the scenes
and he was telling me he's like he can
he can track Linus's links and we're all
the other links to his videos go and
most of those links are you know
websites that don't do anything they're
just there but YouTube sees all those
links embedded and they're like wow this
video is pretty popular right so we got
to prioritize this thing because it's
being shared all over the place that's
how people manipulate the algorithm and
-
is doing that full force and you can see
it I mean after every video of mine that
comes up it's literally aligned this
video it's kind of frustrating but
there's nothing we can do about it
because he's already been established
that well now he already has that
reputation with YouTube the links on top
of that just there's such gravy so let's
see here best 370 motherboard for 250
I'm looking at maximum heroes or if
gaming 7
I haven't actually tested an Asus board
in a while they're sending two boards I
should be here soon one's an ITX board
the other ones a full-size ATX 370 board
so I'll be able to talk more about h2
sports in a second but for the time
being gigabyte I mean the gaming seven
boards from gigabyte are always great
I've had the Rison I am four board from
them the gaming seven board and I've
also I think I have the gaming 7z 374th
I'm not mistaken they're great boards
great overclockers and they look pretty
sweet too so as far as I know gigabytes
perfectly fine
but I can't really compare them to Asus
yet because I have had my hands on Asus
equivalents computer professor thank you
for your time Stein studio I think I
shall do it myself
thank you I completely missed it I did
it scrolled too fast it scrolled too
fast
Oh No thank you for the time thanks for
watching my dude here in Romania we
start to see a decrease in GPU prices
finally yeah I'm kind of want to
investigate that a little bit I have a
feeling that this is kind of like a
premature declaration to an extent yes
we I mean graphics card prices are gonna
settle back down they have to but at the
same time I don't want to jump the gun
and be like okay they're gonna drop next
month or they're gonna drop next week or
tomorrow
you know like there's no set in stone
date and it's really all dependent on
how the market plays out the the supply
and demand curves from an elementary
level are going to determine a lot of
things a lot of different prices across
the spectrum but on top of that I mean
you got to look at what these
manufacturers are planning to do in the
future right with Volta on NVIDIA side
what AMD is gonna do with the horizon
plus release and maybe what they're
gonna be doing on the Radeon side it
really just comes down to what they
foresee and it's obvious by this point
that the man
factors did not foresee the huge demand
in graphics cards and if they did then
maybe maybe kudos to them for that
because they're right shorting the
supply and they were able to charge a
lot more for them at least the the you
know AI bees are in particular but
Nvidia is as well if they're not out of
stock you know they're not they're not
hurting from this that's something you
got to realize just because the graphics
card is out of stock temporarily it does
not mean anything bad it's actually a
good thing in the long run because it
means you have that demand necessary to
drive your inventory so you know it's
it's really not something that I'm
prepared to just say well they're gonna
drop next week they're gonna drop next
month you really never know there are so
many factors that play in that market
you can only really look back in
hindsight and say well this is why this
happened but you know things could be a
little different this time around your
thoughts on in videos release on the
release of the videos Turing I have no
clue I don't read most I don't look
ahead and read like you know leaks and
all that stuff for the most part I don't
like talking about them because there's
no guarantee that any of that stuff is
genuinely true especially when they
start talking performance numbers gear
seekers love the channel man keep making
awesome content I really appreciate that
think of that donation my dude and
hopefully you stick around hopefully I'm
not too boring I'm watching myself in my
own live stream I'm kind of splitting up
I'm hoping you guys aren't seeing that
that break in the live stream I'm not
sure what's going on there let's see
here Matthew how do I make a good how do
I make a good cut good content like you
but on a budget Mathew Avila has asked
this look you got it you gotta have an
investment upfront I don't recommend
starting with camera with like a cell
phone camera excuse me because you're
gonna automatically produce pretty
predisposed yourself to an audience who
doesn't care as much about quality and
while that's great I mean ultimately
content like you know what you're
talking about is gonna matter at the end
of the day people do care about
presentation they really do when I
started the channel I had like a $150
DSLR camera it was just a point shoot
camera and I think it shot 1080p 30 but
at a horrible bitrate and my audio is
trash I just
nothing was scripted
it really says a lot about your effort
and your just your motivation if you're
willing to put more money into it
upfront and put more effort into the
quality of your videos if you are just
gonna say I don't know if you're just
gonna you know throw up with a cell
phone camera and start you know filming
yourself that way you're talking about
random stuff it's it's really hard to
get your you know to get your feet off
the ground and it's always something
people ask me is like how do you get
your channel like out there right how do
you get it to grow so fast and it really
comes down to just those like one hit
wonders really you gotta have like one
or two really good videos that people
share all over the place and that's how
you get your name out there and then you
start pumping out content that's
relatable and that's reliable and
consistent and has a high production
value and there you go you know there
there's your there's your shoe in the
door so be diligent spend money upfront
you have to I think I would do it that
way all over again if I had to I would
sell stuff if I had to to to invest in
YouTube gear just because I prioritize
that above other things in the beginning
it's really difficult to to not do that
enough rambling dan that was a good
point
I was so hyped just to get by two to
three percent decrease that I thought it
was gonna get back to price as soon but
how you said it will take time yeah I
mean it will take time it's gonna be I
think it's gonna be gradual decrease in
prices and even then I mean I think the
use mark is gonna be even more out of
whack because people are gonna know what
to even ask for their graphics cards and
most people who want to pay you know
five six hundred bucks for a gtx 1070
which is ridiculous but that's what
they're doing aren't gonna know if they
should still be paying five or six
hundred bucks so their GPU you know like
how do they know what the use markets
supposed to be like if the people who
are selling those cards told him what
they should be selling them for
something me let it hit him hit and miss
the one really good deal will be
snatched up really quick and then it's
back to the five six and red dollar
prices for the ten seventy you know it's
just an example it's gonna be pretty
crazy everywhere let's see mr. wonderful
says prefer unique content over video
quality that's cool mr. wonderful but I
guarantee you that if you can't
understand half of what the video you
know what the subject is saying in the
video because this audio quality is
trash you're not gonna care how good the
content is because you won't know what's
going on in the video that's why I'm
saying you have to prioritize these
things to an extent because if you don't
then no one's gonna be able to first off
enjoy the content because either your
footage is trash or your audio is trash
and and then how do you even convey the
topics that well if people aren't
willing to listen to that horrible you
know that horrible wine in the
background that hissing noise or
whatever you have that's disrupting that
optimal production quality that you're
looking for then tell ops technically in
80s and under cape it can be configured
to run like 80 600 K to bring temps and
power drawdown possible okay I think
over that context do you think see
Sebastian asked do you think later on
like q3 of 2018 GPU and ram prices will
go down like others are saying this goes
back and I literally just talked about
the Sebastian rewind the live stream
like ten minutes it's hard to tell it
really is there so many market factors
at play it's probably gonna be a gradual
decrease and prices will be all over the
place when that happens especially in
the use market if you're just getting
here the giveaway is gonna be announced
at like the forty five minute mark we
usually do this for just an hour so I'll
I won't do it at the very end you know
gonna stay along for that long on the
ride but I'll be given the gift card
away fifty fifty dollars and spend it on
whatever you want on Amazon just for
answering a simple question which we'll
get to soon if you watch two weeks ago
livestream you'll know what I'm talking
about
let's see Corey says much love man love
your work you deserve more recognition I
appreciate that I think I think we rode
that gravy train train in the beginning
I think it's harder to get exposed now
it's a lot more difficult this
environment on YouTube but we're trying
we're sticking around you know we're not
gonna stop so thanks for thanks for
doing that thanks for sticking around
let's see Lewis says last LTT video was
a total audio show was it really
that bad what which video is that I kind
of want to watch it now that's not like
- that's really strange Alisa did it on
purpose do TB Fox says is the define
mini C good in hot country like
Philippines the mini seat yeah I would
if you have like a micro ATX motherboard
or no
you see ya the many seas of the
micro-atx version I believe the ITX
version is the I don't even know what
that I take first goal but yeah if
that's the microwave text version then
it's gonna be perfectly fine just make
sure you get a few fans in there you
know unless your rooms getting like 35
degrees Celsius and I think you should
probably worry a little bit but near
you're not gonna have a problem in the
most part a special agent chicken hi I
love the streams thank you for that one
dollar and 99 cent donation thank you
for shorting me one penny I'm just
kidding I just I think it's really funny
that like the people on mobile who
donate they have to be like they have to
scale at $0.99 increments so you can
always tell who donates on mobile unless
you guys are just being trolls on the
desktop side and shorting me one penny
which is pretty funny to be honest hey
there's RJ Cuthbert s'en but he's got
Tom's MySpace page in there myspace
profile page he says oh hold on it's
hard to see these all right why do you
think that the Intel management engine
vulnerabilities that have come out over
the past year are being ignored in
comparison to the coverage the Spector
and meltdown got I don't know about
those other vulnerabilities so I'll have
to research those before I make the
comment on that but I I think that the
meltdown inspector coverage is being you
know is is being showcased as much as it
is because this was something that
wasn't talked about for a long time II
this came out of nowhere right I think
that Intel hardware vulnerabilities have
been known for a long time I mean it's
AMD has these two but they're not
anywhere near the security risks that
meltdown inspector were at least when
they were exported by those people who
discovered them in the first place it's
all circumstantial I will have to do my
research and the other things you're
talking about but there's a reason why
they you know these two are getting the
recognition they are and it's because
they're pretty serious when when I you
know when you get down to it I got to
ask why do you plan on traveling to
Venus no because I see what you did
there
are you talking about my talking about
my first video aren't you that's a true
fan right there Common Sense finance I
appreciate that I almost want to do that
video over again just because it's so
cringy to look back in here
thing what's your phone Greg I have two
different phones that I kind of switched
between I have the LGB 30 and then I
have an iPhone se because it's really
small and still pretty powerful see game
or get game or rally says hello I have a
question I'm using an ASUS Maximus Hero
5 with AI 588 Sony here running at four
point six speaker Hertz with a one-point
162 V core and using an air maker eight
on idle for TC but testing it runs at 85
C should I get an AI oh I don't know
what the air maker 8 is is that this up
so sounds like it's something from
Coolermaster yeah it is okay a murica 8
it's a pretty beef he's pretty beefy a
CPU cooler you got there and if you're
still hitting if you're still hitting 85
see you could you might want to check
make sure your coolers mounted properly
and you might want to check make sure
you're using like you know quality
thermal paste because that's a little
hot for 4.6 gigahertz make sure you know
your your coolers getting adequate air
flow from the front of the case or from
the top or what happy whatever your
config may be where is this live video
coming from it's coming from my office
it's really weird weird question but
there you go Special Agent chicken
shorted me another penny cuz cuz it
feels like doing that yeah I'm gonna
mark you down I'm marking you now I'm
not gonna put you in timeout of course
not
but I'm tempted I'm tempted to what do
you thoughts on whoa I just wrote you a
bunch of question I'm sorry for that our
pre bolts worth it I mean I think in
today's market I think people's have a
have a value proposition definitely
because basically the companies that
build pre-built are buying these things
in bulk all these components so they'll
go to EVGA for example and I'll say hey
we want to order 50 or a hundred of your
1070 TI for the wind two's and we want
to pay you know X amount of dollars for
them which is maybe be a 10 and 20%
discount in bulk right because they're
buying in bulk and this these deals were
usually secured in contracts month
ago so before these prices ramped up you
know very high and a prebuilt to do
contribute to the GP shortage just a
tiny tiny bit but they do actually buy
in bulk like that from a Ivy's from a
bee manufacturers and even from a video
directly so there's you know there's an
advantage there from from that
perspective as in like they were able to
pay less for them so they can charge
less for them because their margins
don't have to be you know as
incrementally high so that's the value
proposition with pre-built but it you
know there's only so much that you can
work with there because at a certain
point those vendors gonna have to go
back to those companies and say hey we
need more stock oh well the price is a
little higher now you know so it's not
like a foolproof system they just got in
at the right time and they have that
like value proposition now because you
can't build for cheaper yourself that's
the only reason why I would ever
recommend a prebuilt it's straight up
that's the only reason why unless you
could literally buy one of those for
cheaper than if you built it yourself
that's the only reason why I would ever
consider pre build oh let's see here
a BK 9 thousands he asks hey Greg are
you how to basic what if I was I mean
really what if I was Tony just put good
noodle and time out good noodle I hope
that was worth it I didn't see what you
said I hope it was pretty funny or
pretty obscene cuz no time outs gonna
hurt it's really gotta hurt it doesn't
it meh I just I just scrolled through
Wow okay Machir in all caps asked should
I upgrade to 77 hundred K or 8700 K
currently running a 7600 Tay no I don't
know I can't answer that question for
you're not giving me specifics like
these vague questions folks you've got
to be more specific than this I don't
know if you need an 8700 K or even a
7700 K based on what you're telling me
what are you doing with your system if
you're gaming fine you're enjoying your
frame right now why would you want to
spend more money especially on a newer
platform like the can't coffee lake
platform
you can't ask those kinds of questions
because I can't help you with those
kinds of questions because they're not
specific enough it's like saying hey
should I get a car well I mean yeah if
you need a car you do you need a car
you need a drive to work and back or do
you live right next to work you know I
don't know it's it's circumstantial
let's see here Greg I want a see grim
tech ask Greg I want a a 1066 gig Strix
model and my friend is telling me to say
about the extra 125 instead of waiting
what do you think I should do wait to
wait till it goes down to around 300 or
no okay oh I see what you're saying so
you're saying I should you by now or
wait until the prices drop more I mean
that's another question I can't really
answer for you if you see utility in the
card at its price point right now buy it
if you think it you're gonna eat your
money's worth for it it's another
question I can't answer because I'm not
you I don't know how bad that you need
it so you know up to you let's see here
with couple donations I want to get
Deniz can five Dalek us mud dude I
appreciate that air or liquid which do
you prefer all right so this this is a
good question
I might even answer this in a dedicated
video I don't know if I've actually
covered this before in a dedicated video
but I prefer if you can get a
sexy-looking
air cooler I prefer air cooling I do
because you can get those things just as
quiet as you can in a liquid cooler and
on top of that there's like zero
maintenance unless the fan breaks and on
top of that it's not gonna I I have a
problem with the tubes I just think that
like flex tubing in general is just ugly
and I've never really liked that with a
iOS so that's the one reason why I would
prefer air cooling if I could get it for
the same price for the same TDP and like
you know the ease of installation is
there and whatnot they'd be quiet dark
Rob pro for that I covered a CES is
looking pretty sweet so check that one
out
if you're considering air cooling let's
see here mark mark gonzales donated $5
might do but you didn't ask question I
appreciate that but I encourage you guys
if you wanted if you want my attention
that bad and you want to donate like
even like I don't care a dollar whatever
whatever the minimum is you all my
attention you want to do that ask a
question I encourage you to especially
if you're willing to grow money at me
I mean I appreciate that but
I want you guys ask questions I really
do let's see Kody CELAC $10 my dude my
dude alright sorry the mics here you
guys could see the mic right yeah
there's the mic alright yes hey keep
making the great content thank you for
restoring my faith in tech tuber is one
question what are your thoughts on GPP I
think it's more of a cluster than
anything else
you know I've got to be completely
honest here I'm not all that qualified
to give my opinions on GPP yet because I
really haven't jumped into the topic
enough to feel comfortable giving you
guys an opinion on it I've seen you know
there were some channels out there who
really like you know this is wrong
shouldn't do this this is corporate
greed blah blah blah and then there were
other channels were like well you know
we don't know the full story yet so hold
your horses I'm not gonna you know say
anything make any statements that are
rash or out of context so I've got to do
my research on that really before I can
answer the question I'm sorry that you
have to get like I don't know answer to
that question but it's something I got
to look into more before I it before I
make his paper on that I hope at least
that you can respect that and you know I
wanted to jump gears and tell you
something that I don't know enough about
yet so I got to do my research basically
let's see can you put your glasses on
you're weirding me out brain is asking
like put my glasses on
yeah I mean I could but then my contacts
with my glasses would really mess things
up for me so I'm probably not gonna do
that I could take my contacts out you
guys get grossed out that he's pulling
out its eye or something weird I went to
the beach so I had to put contacts in
because I can't see Jack without them or
my glasses
let's see newts I have been gaming on a
laptop that is not made for gaming
recently when I do the air from the
vents heats up a lot is this bad for my
laptop and could anything bad happen if
I don't stop good question especially if
you just you know you buy one you use it
you're like why isn't getting so hot
this isn't normal it's not good there
are a couple fail-safes there most of
the time the laptop TDP like the
the laptop dissipate heat from the CPU
or from the GPU will be sufficient for
that CP or GPUs operating frequency but
in the event that it's not then what
will happen usually is the CPU or the
GPU or both assuming you have both both
of them will thermal throttle let's
assume you have just a CPU so if you
have just a CPU and that CP is getting
up to 90 90 to 93 degrees Celsius right
really hot
if that happens also I'm seeing that
buffer I'm sorry guys I don't know why
that's happening hopefully it doesn't
stay around that long alright so if you
see that then what's gonna happen if you
pull up like a hardware utility monitor
it'll show your CPU frequency your CPU
will thermal throttle which means that
it'll drop its frequency to adjust for
that heat output right if the cooler in
the laptop is not pushing heat away
quick enough and things are getting
really hot on the core level a package
level then the CPU will throttle itself
to a lower speed to preserve itself and
keep it from overheating and damaging
the long run so if it's a relatively
modern laptop you know circa 2010 and up
it's gonna have that failsafe built in I
wouldn't worry too much about it unless
you start seeing weird artifacts on your
screen or something
all right I'm scrolling down here let me
see if we got my own mind momen salah
thank you for that $0.99 donation not
sure if you're on mobile or if you just
felt like shorting me a penny but I
appreciate it anyway thank you okay I'm
getting to I'm getting to him you guys
Ken five dollar donation thank you and
EDX source is starting his third
water-cooled build a part one hundred
video oh I want to say some things right
now but I'm not gonna and gave me crap
for building so many custom cool dupes
so quickly you made a comment quality
over quantity right but I would take my
own custom loops over his any day I'm
just gonna say call me biased but I
think I got a little better taste in the
custom loops and he does and a little
more experience cuz I've built like
twelve since his first one so okay
there's my little jab at edy he'll
probably come back at me on Twitter and
say ah
we have fun he's actually a really cool
guy I know I'm a little bit never met
him in person but but you know he's he's
genuine he's he's honest and I can
appreciate that Kennedy asked Intel or
AMD Kenney I literally have a video
answering that question it's like
literally titled Intel versus AMD so
thank you for your donation my dude but
I'm gonna forward you to that video it's
like you know five days old at the max
and it will answer that question for you
so check it out Eric Lou Wald thank you
for that $4 and $0.99 own ation thank
you for shorting me one penny I will put
it on your tab thank you will ray
tracing render my Titan XP useless ray
tracing I feel like I hadn't I feel like
I should know what that is but I don't
I'm Ethan I'm so sorry Erik I I don't
know how to make you feel like you got
your money's worth on that question cuz
I don't know what you're talking about
maybe someone in the chat can tell me
and I'll be able to answer it Ethan
asked Greg why are you so sexy you know
it's just one of those days I wake up
and I feel sexy as hell and then some
other days I wake up and I'm like man
this isn't a video kind of day so I got
to kind of play it by ear but you guys
know how it is right you wake up you
feel awesome
energized you feel sexy inside none of
the days you just like I want to go back
to sleep and skip this one so yeah okay
a message was retracted but I got a
dollar donation from somebody it's
really weird uh thank you to whoever
that was see gdb where was that gdb all
right here we go
$2 Canadian thank you for that when do
you think we'll see next-gen GPUs I
really don't know I'm expecting some
time after Computex which will be May or
maybe maybe at Computex and video
probably announce something at Computex
and they don't know announcer a few
weeks before I'm pretty sure that's how
it worked last year so stay tuned I mean
it's coming soon and if we don't hear
anything soon then we're just gonna
we're just gonna you know yell at them
until they really something I think
we're due for something else scrolling
down here sorry about the weird internet
issues I don't know what's going on
every now and then my OBS quality rating
drops to red which isn't good
ken another $2 donation thank you for
that I don't know why you did that it
could have asked a question for that but
thank you
Alexander pace asked will you be making
a video with McLovin anytime soon live
your continuity to work no I don't think
so McLovin is working everyone asked
about McLovin but he's got his own life
he does his own things I just had him in
when it was convenient when he wanted to
give me someone's time to make a video
with me but that's just you know that's
all I can really tell you I haven't
talked I'm on a swing a long time
scrolling down here scrolling down yeah
quit hitting your cat cable yeah I don't
know what's good I don't know what's
going on with the internet but every
none that it is straight up dropping for
some reason Alton check that's probably
something in OBS that I messed up before
I started the stream what are your
thoughts Johnny Depp asks what are your
thoughts on the new fortnight mobile
port Brad personally I think that the
best mobile games are PC game ports what
about you I don't know about fortnight I
don't play for a night I don't like
fortnight I think it looks like cartoon
I play pub G because I'm a gentleman
right gentleman play pub G so I did try
out pub G Mobile which is what your
question should have been and I thought
it was okay I think it's a little funky
you know you gotta like aim and then you
got a fire so there's always like a
delay there and it's so funny because
people are just like staring at each
other for seconds before anyone starts
firing just because no one can aim the
net pass maybe look with like game pads
you can sync to your your screen and be
a lot better Matthew asks do you expect
there to be rice in seven AP you not
sure I really don't know I have no one
telling that I in tell us or AMD AMD has
not told me anything in regards to that
so I can't really answer that question
let's see Cody says thank you for not
playing fortnight well Cody thank you
for agreeing with me let's see is an
eight core Intel chip coming soon I have
no knowledge on that if I did I wouldn't
be able to tell you anyway more than
like because it'd be under NDA but I
don't have any knowledge of a consumer
grade eight core chip from Intel coming
out anytime soon so that's all I really
got for you expect though with the
fabrication process that
Architects are shrinking from what do we
at now are we at 10 nanometers 10 I feel
like we should be
next up 10 is coffee like 14 or 10 I'm
so pretty sure copy they still 14 right
yeah it is
so the next step I think is 10 if it's
not 10 at 7
they have weird jumps but that's where
it's going and I feel really stupid for
having to Google that but that is
literally that's me sometimes so yeah I
think that maybe in the next gen we'll
see something like that I mean there's
definitely a trend now to push more
cores in and maybe they're you know a
compromising frequency along the way and
I'm sure many people would be ok with
that you know Intel hitting 5 gigahertz
that keeps it you know above AMD on the
gaming side because games still do
prefer maybe a max of 4 to 6 cores at a
higher frequency and that's something
AMD hasn't been able to do yet but we're
gonna hope for that with Rison plus
that's something that Intel might not
want to compromise on so until they can
keep that frequency up and pack 2 more
cores in and keep the power delivery
side of things stable we might not see
that
Mason Chappell says Ford you donated $2
thinking for that we'll upgrading from a
1500 X to 1700 helped in OBS it
certainly would if your CPU usage is
around 60 to 80% with your 1500 X then
jumping to a 1700 which literally comes
with twice as many cores and twice as
many threads in that CPU then with the
1500 you're gonna see a huge drop in CPU
usage which will benefit you greatly for
streaming I would still say that I mean
if the kinder Dex is decent for
streaming but if like I said your CPU
usage is peaking then it's time for an
upgrade that's just that's what I would
do it again just keep it simple
Crypton it trip Krypton Krypton ik e34 i
think i said that right thank you for
that $5 donation money I'm currently
running up an RFI of 1600 with a gtx
1080 on a be 350 motherboard do you
think I should upgrade my CPU to get the
most out of my 10 eight
hmm okay so this is a tricky one it
depends on the title it really does but
I'm gonna say I mean I said this in a
video before the r5 1600 paired with the
gtx 1070 is one of the best combos you
can currently buy it really is and if
you want to drop to something a bit
lower than that if you want to throw a
1060 in there or an rx 580 and maybe
arisin 5 1400 it's gonna be a good combo
with something like that but you could
still go with r5 16 and and have plenty
of CPU lead way there so with a 1080 I
think you're still fine with an r5 1600
I really do
many people will probably disagree with
me on this but I don't see the added
value in upgrading from a framerate
standpoint based on the games that I've
tested excuse me because for the most
part they're not going to utilize the
extra cores that rise in seven offers
anyway unless you're doing a lot of
heavy multitasking in the background no
excuse me I'm scrolling down here let's
see Michael J is almost $3,000 on a
Macbook worth it for a fully spec
15-inch upgrading from a low-end 2015
model for programming and network
administration ah
this one's tough this really is tough
probably more question for will than me
I don't do that kind of stuff on my
macbook so I wouldn't really know but I
can tell you that the true quad core
models of the MacBooks are leaps and
bounds more powerful than the one that I
have and what I have is still like that
that dual core i5 and even the i7 is a
dual core and at least until they got a
coffee like in this thing I started
throwing through quad cores in their
ultra low power quad cores but still
massively better but because Apple is
always a generation behind with CPUs
being thrown into their newest MacBooks
unless you're willing to wait a year to
go with the MacBook Pro that has at
least you know the 15-inch models always
have the true quad cores so go with that
one for sure I don't know if spending
$3,000 in one is just a
five but MacBook Pro 15 inches what I
would do if you want to stick with Mac
all right scrolling down here
Kobe water is asked hey do you have deep
you do the classified classifieds
judging mind if I send you mine and have
you judge its value Kobe sure thing if
you want to send it though don't send it
to my email cuz I don't I get a bunch of
random stuff from random people I prefer
you guys not to waste my time or yours
that's more less from business stuff but
if you have that link lets click I don't
know how we're gonna do this here try to
send it in the chat I'll look for it and
it's gonna probably be blocked or
something but I'll just enable it and
then I'll be able to click on it I can
judge it live for you if you'd like that
scrolling down here for tonight
Vico says I hate fortnight that's for
sure I'm loving that you guys hate
fortnight I love you guys for that let's
see Bojangles fortnight better than pub
G don't at me bow I will argue with you
to the moon and back about this one I I
watched I must confess I haven't played
it myself
here's what I have done though I've
watched Lisa play it at least is my
fiancee
I watched her play it and I thought it
was the dumbest looking thing ever
so you can hate me I'm sorry I just
don't think it looks all that appealing
it looks like a cartoon version of
pubsey and I just told her that so it's
a preferential thing really let's see
scrolling down here up above the
scrolling down I see
angry guy asked which fan do you
recommend for silence and good
performance kind of like a middle ground
I depends how much I want to spend I
always go with be quiet be quiet silent
winks three fans I think they look great
and they're pretty they're not pretty
they're really quiet so if you want a
quiet fan it's not gonna really break
the bank but at the same time it's gonna
do what you want to do for a decent
premium silent makes three is a way to
go of my book
see scrolling down are you going to do a
deep cool Quadzilla build
I I wasn't planning on doing it wills
gonna do it eventually but I have the
quad stellar and I kind of reviewed it
I just didn't build in it so we're still
waiting to put that video together I
feel like that case demands like the
most expensive and insane hardware and
we just don't have it on hand yet so I'm
kind of waiting to get that stuff
together and I start to get GPS right
now from any vendor because of the
current state of graphics cards
scrolling down here Mark Gonzales and a
$5 donation thank you my dude any news
on the new in win' Oh 11 err case oh you
mean Lee Anne Lee
that's a Lee Lee case not in wind but I
understand your confusion uh and yes
until it's coming out with a high 990
708 core soon I read it last week be
careful where you read that mark I mean
it's easy for any website you're just
say like that and to have people
kind of be behind it like yeah finally a
chorus but I'm actually thinking about
the rationale behind it so I mean you
might be right
but there's nothing official released
yet so don't take that you know as fact
take it with a grain of salt
and as for the lien leo 11 err case yes
they are sending one very soon I do
think it's under NDA though maybe I
mean--the under NDA but I can't release
the video until a certain date so I
can't really tell you too much about it
apart from what you saw at our CES
coverage in Vegas but I will be
receiving not the OL Levin air but the O
11 dynamic with the tempered glass I
think that one looks better I'm not too
concerned about air flow it I just want
things to look really pretty in in my
case so that's why I'm going with the
dynamic so stay tuned it'll be here like
in the next few days to be honest with
you and it's white which is not what you
guys saw at CES so should be pretty cool
can't wait to build a white thing
building it you guys know how I do
let's see reg or rysiek Greg how much
performance loss if any is for sticks of
RAM verse 2 sticks of RAM and rise a
platform assuming both have the same
total gigabyte of RAM I haven't really
tested this to be honest with you
Rison does benefit from a higher
frequency but not you know anything
super substantial in the way it works
typically
is the I have a video talking about this
without going into too much detail Ram
speed affects the Infinity fabric
communication lines between CC X's and
the CC X's or Core clusters inside Rison
ships so if those cores can communicate
faster which is linked directly to
memory speed then in theory those chips
can execute tasks faster not and that
would increase frame rate right because
the CPU can can respond to more draws
from the graphics card in a nutshell
that's what happens when you have faster
RAM so I would say it really depends on
how you know incrementally lower your
RAM frequency drops as a result to go in
with four dims versus two so if you're
going with two dims and you're at like
30 200 megahertz which is really good
for Rison and then if you thrown another
two dims and you have to drop that
frequency to like 2800 you're not gonna
see too big a difference I mean you're
really not I would say you start seeing
a really big difference at around 1600
megahertz 1800 megahertz 2100 megahertz
that's where you see the biggest drops
is when you go from like 3,000 megahertz
down 2,000 megahertz but from 3000 to
2800 or 2666 most of the time you're not
going to notice too big a difference
maybe 1 or 2 3 4 or 5 percent difference
overall and if you're gonna pay a big
premium to get the 2 gig kit or the to
Tim kit then don't worry about it
alright scrolling down here scrolling
down here scrolling down here we go here
we go here we go here we go I got a
catch up to the to the modern fuzzy
would you ever try riding a motorcycle
dirt bikes in particular I have ridden
bikes before my friend had a smaller one
Smallville crotch rocket I rode things
scared the heck out of me my one of my
other friends back in high school his
dad had a chopper Harley and I rode that
one and it was actually like rode it and
we were just up and down his
neighborhood I liked it but I think that
the the danger involving there's too
many idiot drivers out there my dad's
always preached against me getting a
motorcycle because he just doesn't trust
other drivers and especially in like
this city people drive like idiots here
like complete moron
so it's not that I don't trust myself on
a bike or not that I don't trust bikes
in general I just think that in some
cases they're not worth the added fun
and just kind of how I see it let's see
caboose banana asks do you take video
ideas yes I do
of course I do free ideas I'll take them
if so I think it would be cool for you
to take four or five CPU coolers and put
them on an electric stove to see if you
can keep it cool all right moving on
then play pub G with Linus please I
totally would if you would add me dang
it
I have lower row up slim jim says they
drive like idiots everywhere trust me
you haven't seen idiots until you come
to Panama City on spring break okay
which is where I am it's the current
time there is no worse place to be than
on a road in Panama City during spring
break at least in bigger cities where
there's just traffic jams galore people
are aggressive but good at driving right
but here half of them are drunk and if
they're not drunk they might as well
because they don't know what the heck
they're doing on the road and that is
how people die frankly so that's just
how that's just how I see it all right
so what's your favorite case right now
Douglas I have a video literally
answering that question exactly how you
worded it so look that up Alfa sounds
like you live in every city
I'm a CDL driver and I'm glad I can be
more aware but so many pickups and cars
Myrtle Beach has so many idiots Spring
Breakers crazy yeah yeah I trust me you
guys I mean unless you live in a Spring
Break town you just don't know college
kids go crazy and have them forget how
to pass a DMV test
scrolling down cheers from Sugar Hill
Georgia thanks Jorge Morales wrong
College question how do you suggest an
SE major applying for college make up
for lower grades you can retake the
classes I'm sure you don't
I hear that but most of the time they'll
let you retake them you can boost your
GPA that way or you can take a bunch of
basket weaving classes and boost your
GPA that way can I take more time gonna
cost more money yeah but you might end
up at the end of the you know at the end
of the four years or three years or
however long it takes you to get out of
college with a higher GPA now if the
company really looked in and saw that
you were getting A's and a bunch of
basket weaving and like underwater
cycling classes then they might look at
just your major GPA which is why that
exists but if you're interested in just
boosting your overall GPA in college
take classes that are you know still
applicable but a little easier that you
can that don't take a lot of your time
away from your main studies and that
could be a good way to boost your GPA do
they have a turn signal problem just
curious that's one of the many issues
they have many of them just swerve lane
to Lane don't even use turn signals boy
pizza plays ask can you make a budget PC
for like three hundred dollars
yeah I mean I can I might try to do that
soon on eBay just like go crazy and just
buy some really cheap stuff that I can
put maybe like a I don't really know yet
I don't wanna the reason why I used to
rise in three in my 500 ish dollar bill
a couple days ago is because I want
modern CPU tech I want the modern
features offered on modern motherboards
and that's something I wasn't really to
compromise on that build but when you go
for something as low as three hundred
dollars then you're gonna jump into like
you know has well Ivy Bridge maybe
bulldozer piledriver stuff on AMD side
which a lot of people are like oh not a
chance not going back to that so they're
definitely gonna be a lot of serious
compromises in the three hundred dollar
build and I hate it when people like
well you could have done this for three
HUD have done this for 300 K well then
do it you know do it show me show me
your frame rates and then we'll talk if
you did it if you put something together
that you think is much better then then
do that and and we'll literally just
compare frame rates I will be happy to
admit that I'm wrong if you guys find a
better way to configure something and on
a fact I'll make a dedicated video on it
be like hey guys don't do what I did do
what this guy did here the links down
below build your own PC like this one if
you want to spend 300 bucks you know
that's
I'm perfectly fine with doing that but
if you are interested in doing something
like that then maybe we could do like a
collab we could have like two or three
people build pcs for 300 bucks like a
competition you know sounds a lot like
scrapyard Wars and just see which one
comes out on top from a value standpoint
that would be pretty cool I would be
totally done with doing scrapyard wars
but I really don't think that there's
any chance we're gonna be asked anytime
soon
I don't even know if I would be that
great at it I feel like I would be so
like just in my head confident and then
I would get there and I would just be
stomped by whoever my competition why
and that would be the end of it so yeah
toe my toe Tobias Tobias I feel like I
always mispronounce his name how are you
say I'm sorry for butchering that name
yes where the car video is where the car
is where the car is Greg cars in the
garage right now I'm actually looking to
sell my s5 very soon there's a guy
interested he might be driving him from
New Orleans who may be picking one up
picking it up soon and then from there
I'm moving on to something else
something probably a little newer
that'll be better on gas that's really
the reason why I'm getting rid of the s5
it's just so bad on gas that I might be
moving on let's see Daniel E Greg yes
scrap yard words hello from Greece Otis
K what's going on with you thanks for
watching what time is it in Greece right
now is it like 6 a.m. 7 a.m.
kudos to you for watching my dude thank
you all right let's see RJ says I play
for $300 I would too something's going
on so if you want to call me on that
let's do it
send me an email I like that Audi it's a
good out it really is it's a really nice
car for what I pay I pay like 20 grand
for it like that's a dirty price for how
good that car looks people look at it
all the time what is that it sounds
really good it's because it's got a
$5,000 exhaust on it was the one thing
it kind of splurged on but armytrix
helped us out with that in exchange for
showcases and us saw those videos but
apart from that I mean I think there's
just the chassis overall the frame the
body looks really good and it's got the
genuine v8 in it which I'm still glad I
went with at the end of the day I
couldn't go into 3.02
just ECU flashing thing got 450
horsepower out of it but I prefer the
growl of the v8 I really do hello from
lines Ville Pennsylvania what's up my
dude we got high from Philippines 11
a.m. here awesome thank you for watching
will tert will Toro taught I guess a
diamond let's see scrolling down here
are you burned your skin looks red is it
warm in the OS yeah I got toasted today
I talked about this earlier livestream
just rewind and then come back to live
it was in the beginning when I talk
about Christmas lights yeah I've had
those things these things plugged in for
3 3 months now yeah looking into
purchasing a Tai Chi X 370 motherboard
and risin 770 hundred isn't worth it
it's beta 5 shark I can't answer that
question for I don't know what's worth
it to you I I said this earlier I can't
tell you guys what's worth it to you or
not because I'm not you I don't know
your circumstances it's kind of like a
pet peeve at this point like I can't
tell you what it is worth to you because
I'm not you you see what I'm getting at
here but thank you for your question
don't worry I'm not mad I'm just I
probably said that three or four times
already in this last room mark and puffs
good to see a bag mark we have a one
dollar and 99 cent on donation Greg
should I wait for for cyrix come back
wait what I feel like I should know what
that is to cyrix come back
I'm literally drawing a blank you're
gonna have to remind me more don't
donate again I'll look for you in the
comments
I just feel like I should know this and
I don't let's see
MRX kick says like your response to J's
minor post on Twitter well of course we
all would like for graphics card prices
to go back down I feel as if a lot of

the blue yeti do you plan on ever
upgrading again Schuyler I I don't know
if you're referring to like really old
like I haven't used the blue Yeti in a
year so but yeah it was it was a
noticeable upgrade only because of the
blue Yeti had an issue like that blue
Yeti in particular was hissing really
bad and the other bluey I did that I
used like three or four live streams ago
that was sitting for a totally different
reason I didn't have things set up in
OBS correctly and I was why we were
hearing some really bad feedback that
hissing noise you're talking about but
blue Yeti is in general actually really
good they're not gonna be hiss even if
you use the USB interface Yeti it's
still fine
it was just user error at that point so
two point four four inches one man right
that was good that was good okay here we
go uh hold on I'm seeing I'm seeing uh
green and give me a link to that bit

finding the deals so I am I want to do
something with him soon he's a really
cool dude really down to earth and and
just upfront with you so I want to do
something on him it's gonna be hard to
do it because he lives in Australia I

like US versus Australia you know used
PC hunting or something along those
lines that would be pretty sweet all
right let's see I'm using a Radeon r7
240 + i3 6100 help what do you want
helpless how's it going Greg Andrew Kuhn
ha what's up dude let's see I am
scrolling I have a system that has a

do you see is worth it to you what is
what are you looking for what your
target framerate what's your anything
these vague questions I can't answer for

Productivity builds the one that I did
the custom loop build flame burn I did
that like two weeks ago it's a custom
loop build with an i-9 in it and gtx
1070 which is all you need for
productivity and I put that build
together and it was literally for
streaming I'm using it right now to
stream you guys can check it out if you
want see there she is looking all fine
and dandy that is the that's the
productivity build and whatever you want
to call it they do the same thing you
can use a gaming build for a
Productivity bill right what's your
opinion on the state of Texas seem to
lose their integrity when they hit the
500k plus mark I can't really speak to
that I mean I haven't hit the five over
k plus mark so I don't know what I would
be exposed to that would compromise my
integrity not sure so maybe I'll get
back to you and we had half a mil call
it a deal master H Wilson 8020 35 verse
20 20 I don't know I never used 20/20
but it's really popular the 20:35 is
kind of a revision of that I have the 20
35 I think it's great but to be honest
with you I'm using these behringer B
twos these are pretty sweet they really
are for the for the price I think we
paid like 150 for this thing would be
too pro which is a really good deal
lights music hooked us up if you live
near Panama City Florida lights music is
the place to go for all your audio needs
they pay me to say that I just really
like how cool those dudes are I've
always bought my guitars and stuff from
them and that's where we went for these
something they give us a pretty sweet
deal let's see em rx kick yo Greg what
do you think of videos new ray tracing
technology I don't know haven't looked
into it yet I got to do that that's a
pretty beefy topic to jump into so it's
gonna take some time Homer has a hatch
how's the apartment life treating ya
it's treating me well the only thing I
really hate about this place apart from
how expensive rent is is the paper-thin
walls these walls are so thin you could
hear someone snoring in the apartment
next to you and he's not storing very
loud because I've heard things go on
much there they're much louder than
snoring in that bedroom stuff you guys
don't want to hear unless you're really
weird
yeah unless you're really weird anyway
you get where I'm going with that
they're just so thin you have literally
no privacy now a great stream just
wanted to spread the good word of the
right to repair Act which has been
passed in 18 states so far and all the
attention helps small businesses like
myself Andre I fish in I don't know what
that is a reference to I don't know
anything about that but hopefully uh
all's well your business sow have you
heard of the band Greta Van Fleet they
sound like Led Zeppelin spot-on really I
have to check them out that I've never
heard of that band but anything with van
in it it's gonna sound pretty sweet
right we have a couple more questions
here I'm gonna call it a day big thumbs
up gaming says Greg how do you feel
about the quality of behringer I
sometimes look at their stuff I'm using
it right now so you know it's live I can
control everything on my own huh sound
board but you're hearing it right now I
can get really close to it you guys can
hear how clear the voice sounds live if
you're satisfied with this then this is
something you should probably consider
and the pro by the way has several
built-in presets so if you want this I
recommend this the 8020 35 is kind of
its kind of a premium product just
because it's audio technica but
behringer is still really good so if you
can find a cheap behringer get one you
won't be I have the b12 and the b1 it's
still fine it sounds almost the same as
with me too
alright thank you to everyone that
helped me out I feel like I'm stressing
for no reason Missy let's see ya Homer
I'm pretty sure when we get into a house
after my leak my lease is up in like
early November and I'm gonna just buy a
house I'm just gonna bite the bullet and
do it I need to do it soon nice shiny
teeth thumbs up for that yeah I think
they only looks shiny cuz I'm my face is
burned those are the beach today so it's
probably why but thank you anyway okay
one more question one more question if
you have a serious and intense and
thoughtful question ask it right now
I'll wait 20 seconds for you guys to
hear this and then I'll start reading
all your responses and going through the
ones that I think are the
valid for the last question in today's
live stream and if you don't get your
question answered this week don't worry
I'll be here next week same time I try
to be here at the same time every
weekend or every what first of the week
is Sunday the first of the week at last
whatever first of the week Sunday night

see it I see the question I want to
answer
