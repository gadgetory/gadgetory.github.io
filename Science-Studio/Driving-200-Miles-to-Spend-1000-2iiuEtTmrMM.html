miles to the Micro Center here in
Houston Texas my brother and cameraman
today set it to right along with me
Thank You Kyle we're gonna go purchase
something I'm not going to discuss what
it is until you actually see me purchase
it because uh I was a little let down he
was to say with the Zeon ten core 20
foot processor yes I was so let down
that I was willing to drive way out here
to buy something that should correct the
issue I'm gonna be spending a lot of
money here
but uh only on a product this this big
so let's go inside
Oh make sure you get that like that they
have a build your own PC section
actually let you know where you can do
it you guys should see what Kyle looks
like right now he's doing this so
stealthily I think he learned from
McLovin a few episodes yeah
he's gotten good at it voila just in
case you didn't have a hyper 212 Evo
they've literally an entire aisle
dedicated to these so many of them yeah
sounds good don't show translates to you
yeah well this these are totally
different cases from what I'm usually
using this one right here check that out
and NZXT s340 for 65 bucks that's a
really good price that's actually
cheaper than what it usually is on
Amazon and Newegg power supply aisle
whoo the graphics card I'll look at that
gtx 1060 super clock from EVGA for $219
yeah that's straight flex flex pay go
folks you've been around on the channel
for awhile you'd you'd know the inside
joke there the curved effect on these
monitors is just a little strange to me
I still need to buy dad a router our
Wi-Fi at home is such trash I've been
telling him I'm gonna buy one and I
haven't done it yet
all right Kyle I'm gonna make the
purchase
sixteen sixteen hundred dollars but
spend 60 hundred dollars on a processor
you see that I seven after sixteen
hundred dollars check that out of 4790k
for two hundred and eighty nine bucks
there's no 289 granted you can pick up a
6700 for cheaper it's not unlock of
$2.99 for 6700 K we're just looking on
better commit here in a sec
do you have a deal with the mother bird
$30 off yeah that's a steal
I already have a next 99th set I'm just
yeah I bought a Z on ya and dizzy on it
I can't overclock it I tried basically
overclocking I got like an extra 10 15
mega rates out of it is pitiful yeah
it's the 6 if the 59 now 69 50 X Z on
version that's the 26:30 v4 and the
discourse pillow I'm in my city 700k is
pretty much impart with that so I if I
want all 10 cores still I might have to
go for 60 but your 6800 K is a great
price that's six cores at the 60 or 60
or 50s 40 PCIe and still six core 69
hundreds and 84 yep and that one though
after that it they're all 40 PCI you and
so at the at the lease a even though
that 1600 K is great it's a great great
price
or I could spend four times that much
and get nearly double the compute power
but gaming wise I'm gonna get almost the
exact same performance anyway
no it's I'm a youtube post science to do
so I'm looking to upgrade my editing rig
my gaming benchmark rig is still the
6700 K so I could get either this one
here for 600 bucks or spend another
thousand and get an additional four
course but have an extreme processor
mm-hmm it's pretty much the best you can
get consumer-grade it's the best you can
get
I'm gonna get the I might get the
extreme one thanks University yeah let
me grab that operator yeah just that oh
yeah no I understand yeah and iPhone oh
you only get one or two extremes oh I
mean I can see why just let her know
that's in okay yeah appreciate it thank
you do they have paydays here gotta get
that payday advertisement
it's the various man going you plan yeah
they don't man I'm Greg nice to meet you
man
cool cool stop by we're just the worst
friend you do know I'm actually
replacing my CPU oh really
I know that Xeon it approaches right yes
working it's not as good as I thought it
would be unfortunately so you see that
black box in that cage over there yeah
what you think that is
6950 X yeah 169 yeah yeah that's a good
choice yeah it's a good choice just an
expensive
some very expensive choice are you on
Santa Rita what's up are you on Santa
Rita no why does that keep coming up
that's not you know I know and it wasn't
me from this cart either I don't know
what that address is but it's wrong
that's why they declined this card I'm
from Florida but I live in Lafayette
Louisiana shouldn't be here
address do you need my address I just
did it okay I don't know where they're
getting that from is the same exact
address on the other card it just pulled
your name and kind somebody that but
something saved me
there you go thank you thank you yeah I
forgot to tell you that so we lost a lot
of our footage because the camera just
automatically stopped filming but uh
that's okay all right so what we ended
up walking out with was not what I
expected to be walking out with and
that's thanks to my local credit union I
blocked my card because they think that
it's stolen I only drove three hours
from home to get here I don't know what
that's about
I'll be sure to heckle on Monday but
when I did walk out with it says 1912
1199 on that but I didn't pay that it
paid $1,000 even plus tax for 69 hundred
K I lost two cores in the process but
ultimately ended up saving seven hundred
dollars I think that's a more rational
thing to do anyway I just wanted the
black box that was really all I wanted
that one for so this one will definitely
be able to overclock I'm expecting
around 4.3 4.4 gigahertz on plenty of
benchmarks for you thanks for well
riding with us to Houston let's see what
this bad boy can do
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
