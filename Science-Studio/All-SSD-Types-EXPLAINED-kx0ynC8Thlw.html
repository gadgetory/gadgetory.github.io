for your next rig can be a difficult
process currently SSD prices are very
respectable they've got many storage
options many different speeds to
consider many different prices I really
this video is appropriate and I must
confess that this reddit post of all
things was what prompted me to create
this video believe it or not some good
can come from that cesspool we'll
discuss that and more in this video not
read it but the SSDs so here we go
another one for the crash course
playlist
so there are two basic form factors you
should keep in mind when choosing your
next SSD the two and a half inch drive
and the in bat to drive much smaller the
former looks something like this it's
usually mounted to SSD trays in modern
cases though they can be placed really
anywhere in a build upside down sideways
duct tape behind the motherboard tray
you get the point I've benefited the
stylus freedom of placement it'll work
with really any relatively modern
motherboard boasting SATA ports I
recommend SATA 2 or 3 and isn't composed
of any moving parts meaning they aren't
as fragile as their hard drive
counterparts a few pros and cons of a 2
and a half inch SSD for one because they
use the SATA interface you'll deal with
higher latency 'z and lower bandwidth
overall and these drawbacks result in
significantly slower effective transfer
rates because the SATA interface is the
bottleneck typically in the realm of
about 500 megabytes per second from both
the reads and writes unless you have a
crappy drive and then typically the
writes are trash and the reads are
respectable these speeds mind you are
still several times faster than hard
drives meaning they'll still be the
preferred OS drive expect boot times in
the realm of about 10 to 15 seconds
depending on what you have loaded on the
operating system to slower drives using
the SATA interface are much cheaper than
their PCI siblings so these straps
should be considered in more budget
oriented builds 500 gig 860 Samsung
Evo's for example these are great drives
by the way are only about 75 bucks each
I recommend these if you aren't looking
to break the bank I've linked them down
below I have first-hand experience with
these even the 850 Evo's were fine but
these 475 or so US dollars are a steal
and three you'll need to connect to
external cables to these drives one SATA
data cable and one state of power cable
right next to its the bigger one overall
just a tad more bulk added to your build
but again definitely worth it if you're
in the market for something relatively
affordable and decent in terms of speed
the next SSD form factor is MDOT -
they're 22 millimeters tall and can
range and basically length from 40
millimeters up to maybe 120 140
millimeters I really depends
motherboards typically support all the
different lengths and the height again
will be almost always 22 millimeters in
that - actually stands for the second
generation of mini SATA hence the M in
the name the form factor attaches to the
computer either via
pcie three and occupying up to four
lanes more on that a second or say two
three or usb3 the physical connector for
this kind of drive looks like this right
here I'll show a close-up which can be
found on again most modern motherboards
now a common misconception here is that
since these kinds of drives use a
different connector
they must inherently operate a much
higher or lower speeds when in reality
the speeds of these drives are largely
determined by the way in which data is
transferred not necessarily by the form
factor the diagram I mentioned earlier
on reddit comes in handy here thanks to
user Alex 2003 super for the original
post the two technology is
distinguishing em 2 drives apart are
SATA and nvme we've already mentioned
SATA whose accompanying drive speeds max
out at around 600 megabytes per second
which is why you want likely to find any
SATA drive in either the MDOT two or two
and a half inch form factor pledging a
speed above this mark the SATA interface
would literally become the bottleneck so
this drive for example is a SATA MDOT to
drive notice how it doesn't promote
transfer speeds above 600 megabytes per
second in fact on the box I don't even
see it listed and it's probably because
it's nothing really to be excited about
if you want to pass this off as a much
faster drive just don't put how fast the
drive is on the box it's gonna be closer
to 3,000 megabytes per second
you better believe that transfer speeds
gonna be on the box so that's a way you
could tell that this was a SATA MDOT -
just by looking at the transfer speeds
you could also tell by the physical
connection on the MDOT to drive say to
MDOT twos are keyed twice there is an
exception to this and we'll discuss that
later in the video
now a few pros and cons of SATA MDOT -
SSDs or as follows one they're
physically smaller I mean come on
clearly smaller than their two and a
half inch counterparts and can thus be
easily installed into any compatible
motherboard to the board of course has
to support the hem dot to interface
right but don't be just too disappointed
here most boards will have at least one
I mean heck even the cheapest a 324 Tyco
and find on Amazon supported one more on
that this video or right here and then
three these drives are roughly the same
price as their two and a half inch
counterparts though you may actually I'm
holding the wrong one this isn't MDOT to
envy me drive this one right here might
cost just a tad bit extra over its
equivalent two and a half inch
on our part but in general if I to
choose between the MBA form factor and
the two-and-a-half inch form factor I
would choose this one simply because if
I wanted to swap this out or maybe just
remove it altogether I don't have to
remove say my graphics card to get to
the end got to drive which is that's
particularly where the port is between
PCIe slots it's more annoying to remove
this and that's really the only reason
why I'd prefer this now another kind of
SSD we'll discuss in this video is the
nvme SSD now I can hold this thing this
is actually from Team Group it's very
fast but also fairly expensive nvme
stands for a non-volatile memory express
and it's characterized by its high
bandwidth and thus fast storage
solutions when memory is non-volatile it
simply means that it doesn't require
power to retain stored information you
can power cycle your computer all day
long and unless the drive itself dies in
the process you'll be able to recover
your data without loss system RAM DRAM
is volatile and on the other hand and
and that basically means that the data
is wiped from memory when current is cut
so that's why you can't use system Ram
to store any important applications or
data long term well go into that in
further detail in a future video but for
now what you need to know is that nvme
storage drives by nature of their
protocols are often extremely fast with
respect to their inherent Layton sees
and transfer speeds the fastest nvme
SSDs I could find on the market exceed
read and write speeds of thirty five
hundred and twenty five hundred
megabytes per second or 3.5 and 2.5
gigabytes per second respectively that
is lightning fast and would result in an
incredibly snappy system overall os boot
times are often under five seconds can
you imagine that
and any game save you these drives load
dozens of times faster than a typical
hard drive once you go in via me it's
very difficult to look back and that's
not to say that all MV messes these are
extremely fast a subcategory of these
drives relates to the number of PCIe
lanes each occupies so for instance this
drive right here is a two lane SSD
whereas this one is a four lane SSD and
the difference is basically and if I
wanted to generalize this transfer
speeds take this Samsung 970 Pro it uses
four PCIe lanes noted by the x4 ording
this is what you want to look for when
you're buying an envy any SSD for PCIe
lanes have bandwidth equivalent to about
32 gigabits per second for basically 4
gigabytes per sec
so theoretically the fastest nvme
utilizing this interface would cap out
at around 4,000 megabytes per second
using the preferred SSD standard other
env meas however like this one right
here are limited to just two lanes so
that means that theoretical transfer
rates cap out at around 2 gigabits per
second instead of 4 moving from two to
four lanes basically doubles your
bandwidth and this right here is an
example of that by the way physically
four lane and Vimy SSDs only have a
single key you can see there's just one
little notch there but a lot of the
Tulane and VMI SSDs will have two keys
just like their SATA in dot 2
counterparts it's it's kind of confusing
I kind of express my frustration with
this on Twitter but some tooling nvme
SSDs will have just a single key and
some will have two keys like their SATA
in bed 2 counterparts so that's really
not a great way it's not an effective or
reliable way of being able to figure out
which is which if it's 2 or 4 lanes you
have to just read the product
description make sure you know which one
you're buying and obviously you should
look at the read and write transfer
speeds because those will reveal how
fast these drives are and typically how
many lanes they're using now here are a
few pros and cons of envy me about two
SSDs one obviously because they're much
faster in general they're more expensive
alright so typically around twice the
price per gig or more or less depending
it depends on the market really which
has historically to turn a lot of PC
builders I've got only two for line MVM
SSDs in the studio and neither of them
are in my personal rig it's just in my
opinion a better value to opt for the
two and a half inch or say 2 m dot 2
drives too many beefier nvme drives will
run very hot and may require heat sinks
with active cooling to maintain adequate
transfer speeds for long amounts of time
to be fair all SSDs will throttle to an
extent under heavy load but this is
something you should consider along with
your use case scenario since you're
likely to spend hundreds of dollars on
these drives you want extract all the
performance you really can now the last
a kind of SSD we'll mention just at
least mention in this video is the PCIe
based SSD there isn't really much that
sets these apart from their Envy Miam to
counterparts save the interface used in
this case it's PCI Express versus the
MDOT two-port transfer speeds are
essentially the same in fact you can buy
little conversion cards that allow you
to connect impact
choose to those boards and then let's
connect those boards to the motherboard
via the PCIe slot so they're really the
same thing it's just the method by which
you connect them to your system is a
little different
PCIe based drives aren't really as
popular since they're much larger than
m2 drives and literally consume a slot
on your motherboard they're also
typically more expensive so just really
isn't ideal or functional one benefit
may be temperatures where some PCIe and
viennese may have bulkier heat sinks or
even fans but again thermal throttling
really only applies to those interested
in transferring gigs of data at a time
by the way I'm not gonna discuss a unit
two drives in this video they aren't
mainstream yet and are pretty expensive
assuming you can even find them in a
consumer market I have however linked a
reliable article down below that may
interest you regarding the technology
and how it works it is very well written
I've also attached affiliate links to
several SSDs in various forms that I
trust and have personal experience with
for those interested in picking
something up they are also in a video
description those kicked back to do go a
long way I appreciate it if you guys
like this video thumbs up you know what
to do thumbs down for the opposite click
