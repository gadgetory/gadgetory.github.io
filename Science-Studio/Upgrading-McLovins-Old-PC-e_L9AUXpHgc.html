headquarters I'm so official we're
taking apart the computer that Greg
built me like three years ago I'm
holding ddr3 which is ridiculously
expensive at Best Buy and we're gonna be
swapping parts into this old rig which
as you can tell I haven't cleaned it
ever this is supposed to scrape like
that no it's not supposed to scrape do I
have to like you guys dude this is like
super cramped this is so cool like it
zooms in on Pepsi yeah I bet they
introduced Pepsi yeah getting them
close-ups I'm like Steve Irwin Greg I'm
following the cat around hey hey we're
asking people on the street would you
rather have the car on the right or the
car on the left which comes with a mesh
is to set a serious question
taking this there you have it people
prefer the mesh is too
I was like on that expedition what's
your cat you had a screw in here you
were trying to rip the mother one out
yes that's why I was getting twisted
well it's kind of difficult to figure
out there's so many screw holes I like
all of the computers and all of the
equipment that's around here so we got
this freaking piece what what is this
case Greg plate catch me up
sir offices from a company called an
ADIZ I reviewed it actually in this
video to appear somewhere up here yeah
yeah this was one of the first cases
that I ever got for free to review and
it's a very I think the coolest thing
about this case is the fact that there's
like anti-sag technology and here like
this plastic holder is perfect for PCBs
that extend past the motherboard so well
I never got a chance to test that out of
it with all the equipment in here Susan
janky yeah yeah this case weighs like 50
pounds testings more interested in this
building yeah dusty one of these puppies
you're like growing fuzz on your car
that's disgusting how could you
well it's gonna watch this I've used a
lot of finger flick it out nine ninety
or nine seventy nine ninety yeah it's a
990 FX yes so that's actually that's
what this cost me 70 dollars I remember
buying it from Computex or waiting at
Computex what's other store micros
microcentrifuge isn't a store whatever
huh I don't remember you're like Jacob
Jacob this is what you need seventy
bucks this is this is a great Buy and
then you're like this FX this is only
like a hundred dollars this is such a
great Buy
it was two or three years ago I made
before and he had anything viable this
was like all we had so I took this out
as the arrow up there get pointed to the
arrow right there yeah okay good because
I took it out I couldn't get its
I mean the way that these look like on
the bottom side because because they're
like you know certain chunks that don't
have little pins on them there's only
one way oh really yeah so it's probably
a good thing I didn't force it in yeah
yeah you would've been pinched see those
keys like yeah it's keyed with the same
palette yes you just drop it in kind of
like well make a video out of this I'll
put some like ultra cheap build together
try to price the parts out online and
then uh am I allowed to touch all this I
feel like I said it's fine honestly this
isn't a bad 990 FX board it's just a 990
FX board that's the only issue really
are you gonna play like dubstep music as
I bring this in on the channel here
right now if you want what do I do
you gonna do I like undo the antennas
well yeah actually someone do that this
already has a built-in back plate if you
notice remember how difficult it is yes
so you can actually just pop one out and
then you need to put one in you just
slide that into place this is a lot
nicer Pepsi's tryin to help ya so change
of plans we're gonna take everything out
of the case
as just so healthy yeah so we're gonna
we're gonna trash these fans either
garbage we're gonna Halloween our County
entire the entire case again we don't
wash she's like there's so much dust off
in this case I know it is so painful
I'll use it to people like clean their
rigs yeah that's like a thing now I will
say that this side where the the
Plexiglas is supposed to go I don't know
where that is Lexi wait wait you lost
the other panel yeah I think so you only
have one tempered glass panel well yeah
one on the bag I don't know that's that
one so you lost the front panel
yeah it's a big panel they're hard to
lose I lost it okay I'm just going to
give you another case you sure yeah oh
my what's going on this way so check if
you're missing a left side panel
I'm missing this front part you lost the
front part of the penalty well it was
pissing me off one night because it's
like wasn't working properly so I took
I've ripped I was trying to pick it up
and I didn't realize that wasn't a
handle and so I picked it up it was
about a fall the whole thing ripped out
yeah so okay another change of plan
we're gonna completely trash this case
whenever Greg and I built this Greg's
like I don't have enough screws for all
of this so we're gonna have to like
disperse them so there's like four
screws holding in the VA's I called
motherboard like two holding in the fans
and like three holding up and to be fair
since that day I showed him this I have
been organizing and these are all screws
for different things like fans power
supplies motherboards SSDs hard drives
radiators so I've learned my lesson
my not gonna be like at Domino's it's
not super heavy okay so a quick rundown
of the specs in his new system fantex
pthrough 50x you're gonna use the
gigabyte X 470 motherboard risin 7 2700
and I think I'm gonna give him a 92 TI
it's one of the zotac cards that I
purchased a while back used to stand up
line up the standoffs put the holes on
the motherboard should let's click it
looks like it won't click in but it
looks like you've got it settled just
like that yeah
boom then and then you can line it up
you see some cutouts there and that's
real screw in the power supply
I should practically make my on the
YouTube channel alright we gotta be
quiet eighty millimeter fans you know
one one forty one forty Greg squeezing
some stuff in the back oh yeah we're
gonna detonator
yeah that's gonna be RGB you know what
sweets gonna be a lid are you an
ordinary thing literally I don't like
keeping stuff looking like the rainbow
that's a good pool yeah RGB I just like
RGB because I can take a color scheme
right yeah you can make this look orange
to match the rest of the stuff in here
or you can make it look white or
whatever this piece again is not
necessary we're just doing it because we
want to look cool yeah I like this case
even more like I thought I liked really
big cases this case but this one thought
smaller than actually like it yeah it
looks what's up pan wide shout out this
is a px we don't know what it is but
it's a pain why clicked in say to kill
it and then say okay hard drive say the
cables Jack yeah quiet they've all 140
fans check SSD check 50,000 cables
everywhere check see in this case here
we have a bunch of dead space between
the edge of the board and where the
cable holes are right yeah so if we ran
fan cables across they look kind of
stupid heaven just like thin little
cables it's stretching across so we're
gonna tuck them in underneath the cutout
behind the motherboard tray and then
have them wrap around so all you see is
the cable coming out from behind the
board small little cable management tips
for those who want to hide as many as
possible to see so a lot more subtle now
yeah that's not something that uh you
guys can try out yourselves you want to
hide your cables then you have this
extra space here that you
is that used for a reason this work
exactly yes so some other boards extend
past these screws quite a bit so they're
not technically e-atx searches the large
ATX some of them are ATX that go up to
here but there are some boards that are
the size of the entire case there like
so they those wouldn't fit because of
this intention here but this gives us
more space to push cables okay basically
so it's gonna be easier to put the right
side panel on this is for data so data
transfer so when you need to read and
write all right that's what to say that
data cables are for and then these are
called SATA power cables and they look
flat like this right so this power is
the drive this will also power your SSDs
and then the thinner cables that connect
here will power or will send data to and
from your last time the last one that
great build me we used a bunch of
leftover parts because no it wasn't
anything special so this time you know
it's looking super duper fresh and okay
so ram ram so because you've got the
orange of black color scheme we're gonna
use team force team force team group
modules these are t4 stems the Nighthawk
modules these are RGB so you can set
these to any color you want or I
recommend white or your engineer and
then they also have the orange accents
paid it onto them which will match the
orange accents on the motherboard and
the orange accents a lot of fans yeah
pretty cool color schemes on here and
let's see that recommended so two and
four so now what's this can I just buy
more of those and just have fun max our
32 key yeah you can't yes this is a GT
of 1070 I was I was gonna give you that
980ti Azote I can have extremes but this
makes more sense because it's orange in
black right yeah we use these parts
almost the same parts in a similar rig
that we put together a few months ago so
this is what the cord looks like
so black and orange then you got a back
plate so if you wanted to push it in
normally right you'd have a nice back
plate to dry clean but we're gonna sit
and it's gonna sit the building this
right so you're gonna be able to see the
orange yeah let's go ahead you're gonna
have orange here orange up there orange
on the RAM and orange in the fans yeah
let's go it's gonna look pretty sick so
we're gonna slide this in I'm excited
like you know for people that know me I
this will be my first ever PC gaming so
I'm excited to try and play some games
with Greg I'm probably gonna suck but at
least I'll have really high refresh rate
and everything yeah you got a nice
modern now 144 Hertz yeah exactly I did
and this system will max out as long as
your settings aren't like completely
maxed out and 1440p you hit over 100
yeah talk me through this case has RGB
even yeah see there's no wires it just
connects like this like little tablets
as soon as you plug it as soon as you
can get that yeah you can see these
little standoffs here so these connect
to these and then that's it and then the
RGB runs from the top down and you can
change it up top you can change the
color scheme this power button also
changes colors as well as this side here
oh really
pretty sure I'm I thought it did
I'll take your word so yeah there's the
back of the case you see good cable
management I was kind of messy given
that makes a lot better than it was
you got three hard drives in there three
drives in here so that's that's part of
the problem yeah but it's gonna be
really easy just like this all right
well the reasons why I like this case so
much I think it's a great price is
because you can literally just slide it
on with no issues this is really just a
simplistic case very easy to steal but
another cool thing about it is the glass
you have to clean this when you
yeah like Pepsi's like snot is all over
this season Greg yeah your old case had
like a really tinted glass panel yeah
this one's less tinted yeah I'm not sure
I haven't tested what the the driver
conflicts are between FX and horizon I'm
assuming it's not good to just swap
drives or not spa drives but swap
hardware
you know stuff up in the generation and
just let everything be some issues so
we're gonna do a clean install just to
be safe and of course will be the hard
drives enough as is and we'll be good to
go will sync up the lighting then you
can take it home and suck terribly oh
yeah but you're used to playing this
game on a controller like I don't blame
you high settings 34 40 by 1440 reading
around 100 FPS so that is definitely a
huge improvement wouldn't you say Jacob
and there's your system so we've synced
all the lighting up except for the RGB
Ram for some reason gigabyte hasn't
updated their software to include
support for the network modules which
means we're gonna have to download team
groups on software to sync those up turn
those orange and then everything else
should be golden all right so thanks for
tuning in to Greg Science Channel I want
to give a shout out to Greg I have my
old rig here very compelling to tell you
more about it than I can
huge improvement I had to 1050 someone
told me that these were like you know
amazing but apparently they're not but
we'll see I want to play pub G and just
after the experience I had with this
black ops 3 that Greg and I used to play
on our previous channel which should no
longer exist entertainment studio yeah I
know for real
you'll be seeing them playing more and
more especially now that I can actually
feel comfortable sitting down and
playing and having a rig that I know
will be able to handle the frame rates I
want to see which you know I played a
quick match here and I was just amazing
I'm looking forward to having a monitor
that can support
frame rates that this can do and get
back into gaming cuz I've been slacking
just shipping it back to my house is
gonna be fun yeah
always keep your original case box it's
a good way to ship your stuff back yeah
examiner take it wherever you want to go
yeah in case if you like lose random you
know parts to it like I do yeah like
your front panel like how do you lose
your front edge to be honest I leave it
I think whenever my girlfriend was
moving out of the house I have a
girlfriend now whenever relations do
yeah I know that may surprise some on
the channel but I think what she moved
out I think she may have stole it you
know I don't know if she stole your
front panel yeah maybe she thought it
looked cool partly what caused me to
stop gaming honestly for a while my rig
would just randomly freeze and I always
thought it was a GPU problem Greg
actually you know everything in this rig
is something that was you know brand-new
but as soon as we had it booting up and
you know installing stuff it would
freeze and then we found out or were
very inclined to believe that the PNY
SSD card that was in it was causing it
to just freezing it reboot the computer
yeah so that was the only thing from
your previous system that was in the new
system right everything else I knew work
because I had used it all in previous
bills yeah and because that was the only
thing from your old system and you still
saw the same problems right there
athlete yeah we concluded by process of
elimination that that was the issue and
we've had frankly we've had issues with
SD cards for MP like regular SD cards
that go into chaos and stuff from PNY so
I'm not sure what's going on I'll mess
it in and see what's up but yeah that's
it's it's it's rare for an SSD it's only
what like a year old
yeah yeah very very new and I mean in
this rig I didn't use it very often
this was my editing rig when I uploaded
to my YouTube channel like forever ago
but this was an addition to that rig and
yeah I haven't had this very long I feel
like every time I show up on your
channel I look more and more homeless
yeah you have like dog fur and like fuzz
all over your jacket just like my dog
looks to like I have a German Shepherd
he loves to pick on my clothes
and then carry them into whichever room
he's going into and they lay on it
alright so I'm gonna take command least
ten fifties here we're gonna see what we
can do with this platform and Jacob's
gonna take home a baller rig basically
the same rig that Lisa uses to stream in
game with she has her system in the
other room and it's basically the same
specs you do the 2700 X and also a gtx
1070 so you and her are gonna see
comparable frame rates which is cool you
can you know you can relate even to the
same settings on basically and you have
the same frame rate or virtually the
same frame rate so setting for that
let's pack this thing up and you can get
the heck out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
