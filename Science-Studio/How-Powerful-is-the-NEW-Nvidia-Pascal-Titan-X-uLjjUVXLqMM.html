1080 then the 1070 then the 1060 and now
the biggest and baddest of them all the
brand new Titan X based on Pascal
architecture so how much do we know how
powerful will it be how power-hungry
price let's figure this thing out let's
start off first with the design the new
Titan X is sporting a similar build to
that of the 1080 with a few minor
changes including a darker brush
however staying consistent to the edgy
metallic theme of its younger siblings
while there aren't many pictures yet to
confirm this we can expect that the
Titan X will also include a matching
backplate now let's jump into the specs
right off the bat 3584 CUDA cores
absolutely insane considering the 1080
already proved itself by crushing the
current competition with its 2560 CUDA
cores remember these aren't scalable
across generations so that the Maxwell
Titan X packed 3072 CUDA cores in with
GPU but fell short of the 1080 which had
fewer nvidia 16 nanometer Pasco design
proves it's worth here greater
efficiency and performance with less
under the hood the Pascal Titan X will
boast an equivalent amount of VRAM to
that of its predecessor whopping 12
gigabytes in total although this time
around that 12 will be enhanced with the
gddr5 X accelerating memory speeds to 10
gigabits per second mirroring that of
the GTX 1080
however thanks to its wider 384 bit
memory bus the Titan X is capable of 480
gigabytes per second would even convert
that is to start off with 10 gigabits
per second that simplifies down to 1.25
Giga bytes per second and then multiply
that times 384 to yield the 480 Giga
bytes per second and keep in mind that
you won't notice these distinct
differences when actually playing games
unless you plan on playing with some
outrageous 3 4k monitor setup which
would be outrageously awesome as well
taking into account a clock speed of
1500 and 31 megahertz as well and vidi
have rated their new king and prepare
yourselves 11 teraflops compare this to
the 9 teraflops floating-point
performance from the 1080 and roughly 7
from
the old Titan X remember teraflop values
are only one side of the coin we have to
consider drivers game optimization a lot
goes into quote-unquote ranking a
graphics card but what I will do is this
use pre-recorded gtx 1070 and 1080 and
1060 3dmark fire strike scores to
extrapolate a fancy statistics term
there
Pascal Titan X performance the gtx 1070
received a 3d mark firestrike 1.1 score
of sixteen thousand and eighty nine when
paired with an i7 6700 k overclocked to
four point six gears and sixteen
gigabytes of 3000 megahertz ram the gtx
1080 received a score of nineteen
thousand 521 and the gtx 1060 scored
eleven thousand six hundred and twelve
if we take into account the coup de
coeur counts of these three GPUs we can
construct a semi natural logarithmic
proportion bear with me I'm an
engineering major where X is the coup de
coeur count of each GPU and Y is the
finalized fire strike score to project
Titan X performance what you're about to
see is not an official 3d mark fire
strike score of the Titan X it's just an
estimation the official score of the
card will vary to a certain degree when
it is finally released
so with nineteen hundred and twenty CUDA
cores for the ten seventy two thousand
five hundred and sixty for the ten
eighty and twelve hundred and eighty for
the ten sixty and 3584 for the Titan X
who I need a breather after that we can
project Titan X 3d mark fire strike
performance to fall somewhere around the
24 thousand mark this simulation
actually calculated 24 thousand and
fifty nine to be precise nonetheless the
Pascal Titan X is sure to decimate any
single card thrown at it and without an
answer from the red team expected
anytime soon this can be great news for
the green teams market share although
I'm not sure many of you are going to be
able to afford this card let alone
desire it given the price tag that
you're about to see now a card that's
powerful will require power it packs a
thermal design power rating of 250 Watts
a splitting image of its former self
keep in mind that TDP is not the same
thing as total power draw so under full
load this card will actually draw more
than 250 watts from a power supply to
TDP is just a an estimation for how much
power in the form of heat the card will
dissipate while under full load the card
will also require a single six pin and
eight
in combo of supplementary power again
identical to the former Titan if Nvidia
grants third-party access to the Titan X
early this time around which it did not
for the previous Titan X we can expect
dual eight pin connectors for beefy
coolers and beautiful LED illumination
that will certainly need the extra power
and finally price how much you ask well
it's not cheap you ready for this twelve
hundred US dollars and to my friends in
other places
you'll almost certainly have to pay even
more the former Maxwell Titan was in a
class of its own last year it was twice
as expensive as its 980ti counterpart
who performed admirably when overclocked
with third party coolers but barely
edged out wins in most scenarios this
time around invidious betting on the
added GPU boost behind the Pascal
architecture and quite a large number of
CUDA cores we're looking at a solid
performance improvement over the 1080 a
substantially higher number of compute
cores but again a substantially higher
price tag you tell me if it's worth it
stay tuned for August 2nd if you like
what you saw the video I had to scramble
to make this thing as quick as possible
because the announcement was just a few
hours ago I said of recording it's 1218
here central Daylight Time but you
preciate the video give it a thumbs up
give it a thumbs down if you don't or if
you just hate everything about life be
sure to click the subscribe button
however and stay tuned for interesting
stuff here on the channel we're gonna do
all kinds of things we're not just gonna
stick with computers
the names science studio so let's stay
true to that this is science studio
