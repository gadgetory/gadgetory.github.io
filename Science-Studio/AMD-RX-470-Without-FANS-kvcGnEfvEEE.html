GPU intensive game something like
Witcher 3 with the very powerful
graphics cards can like a gtx 1080i but
under one condition
you cannot have any fan running
whatsoever active cooling is a trend
that's been around since the late 90s in
fact much of the early kits were sold as
aftermarket units the original PCBs did
not come with fans because they weren't
technically needed even though they did
get very hot but nowadays of course
almost any card you can buy that you can
actually game on will come with the fan
but let's try not using one well hold on
a second let's not use a GTX 10 atti a
card like that will certainly thermal
throttle after just a few seconds of the
GPU being under full load rather let's
test something that's much less powerful
and that will output significantly less
heat something like an AMD rx 470
I chose this XFX variant of the rx 470
which you can find in Best Buy and
online at amazon.com linked in the video
description for one very specific reason
that's because you can actually remove
the fans just like that and from a
practical standpoint the only reason you
would want something like this is to
swap out the fan LED colors something
from white to red maybe or from white to
blue you could just manually shut off
the fans if you wanted to run this test
by yourself but I do think it's cool to
not have fans installed period it just
looks just looks weird you don't see
graphics cards like this anymore so I
took this card void of any fans
whatsoever I can't get over how weird
this looks just strange and installed it
into my AMD 1700 X Rison PC bill that's
in the fan text p400s tempered glass
edition - built it right here but I took
the custom loop out of it right now it's
being cooled by captain 240 e X and this
card of course is just being passively
cooled by the copper and aluminum combo
we've got here three copper pipes and
just an aluminum heatsink it's really
all we've got going on here let's see
what temperatures look like now right
off the bat after installing the latest
crimson driver for the RX 470 I realized
that my temperatures were slowly
climbing and they didn't stop climbing
until around 65 66 degrees Celsius which
is not a great idle temperature at all
and this mind you is at a stock
frequency just with auto-tuned voltages
I didn't bother tweaking anything up
front I wanted to have kind of a control
test before we decided to tweak anything
I expected we'd have to drop the
frequency and probably under volt the
GPU quite a bit so I ran the
superposition benchmark from Unigine
this is a super overkill benchmark I'll
have more detail on that in a separate
video but it just stresses the hell of
the RX 470 and yet the computer shut off
in like 20 seconds or so it actually
throttled the GPU frequency down to a
mere 300 megahertz on its own in an
effort to keep temperatures below 90
degrees Celsius but that didn't really
help after about 10 additional seconds
upon throttling the entire computer
decided to shut off oh and by the way
our fps was terrible we're talking low
low teens before the throttling and once
the throttling occurred down to 300
megahertz our frame rate dropped to a
mere 3 FPS so obviously a few changes
needed to be made first up I had to
reinstall these fans and get that GP to
cool back down to around 35 40 C just
put the fan curve on like 70 80 percent
and in about 20 seconds or so the entire
card cooled back down to what you would
expect it to idle at around 35 40 C and
then I just turned the fans off so they
weren't running after that point even
though they were still in stall that's
why you see the fan LEDs you'll see them
in the next few clips of b-roll so I
decided to hop into the Whatman section
of the crimson driver and reduce my
frequency down by 30% which is the
lowest that I could go and I also
dropped my GPU voltage to 800 millivolts
also the lowest I could go I wish that I
could have dropped lower than that but
the crimson software would not let me
and I really didn't think that that was
low enough 800 millivolts is only a 20%
drop from what the car usually demands
under full load most cards will require
about a volt or so when they're under
load
so we hundred millivolts isn't a big
drop and that showed in the next set of
tests that I ran with superposition so
even with the 30% drop in our original
frequency again starting from about 40
degrees Celsius as well as a 20% drop in
over
card voltage just to the GPU the memory
I didn't bother tweaking with that
wasn't a big in effect as the GP voltage
was I still ended up crashing the
computer it just took longer for that to
happen temperatures stayed in the 70s
and 80s for significantly longer we
actually almost finished the benchmark
which would have been enough for me that
would have been mission accomplished but
that was not the case in fact it began
throttling again at ninety degrees
Celsius and once it did that about maybe
thirty or forty seconds after the PC
turned off and that was for I called it
quits I couldn't do it with an rx 470 I
probably could get by with a low
something just super underpowered for
talking maybe like a GT 740 that that
might be a card that we could do it with
but for now a mainstream card that you
can game in 1080p 1440p with and be
comfortable it's going to require some
sort of fan or active cooling system you
just can't get by without a fan unless
you're willing to compromise severely on
performance at that point you might will
just buy something that is much cheaper
that won't bring the frame rate that
you're originally looking for so with
that I hope you enjoyed the experiment I
was just very curious I wondered if I
could I could do something like that and
have a you know virtually silent
graphics card apart from coil whine
which this one isn't really bad with if
you liked the video be sure to give it a
thumbs up thumbs down for the opposite

just interesting stuff here on the
channel this is all is our studio thanks
for learning with us and watching pcs
crash
