would you want it apart from its
all-aluminum body duel 100 millimeter
fans with silent programming integrated
RGB system with persistent red accents
on the fans themselves custom PCB with a
5 + 2 phase power system pre apply
thermal pads where they should be and
unique craftsmanship what else could
possibly persuade you to buy this
particular card it obviously has nothing
to do with its 1920 cuda cores 8
gigabytes of vram or relatively low TDP
I couldn't get this thing over 70
degrees for the life of me even after
three solid hours of GTA 5 and 1440p
when overclocked to eighteen hundred and
fifty megahertz I suppose I shouldn't
have said that but okay on to more
important things
krummy ketchup and mustard cables yeah
that's a good one these things are just
hideous although I doubt anyone
interested really in this card would
need these right okay but how about that
crown contour up top what is this some
kind of weapon you'll cut your eye out
kid way too sharp why on earth did they
bother to chisel this beautiful I mean
dangerous design into its aluminum frame
and how about that RGB functionality
talk about overkill no folks this does
not give your GPU any additional boost
is that what the kids are calling it
these days boost it looks awesome I mean
if you aren't prone to seizures
it might look awesome and it isn't like
there are only two or so these so-called
RGB LEDs they surround the entire
friggin card I just don't understand why
you'd want to illuminate in any way
shape or form such a cool such a piece
of hardware what does RGB even stand for
wrong Chrome beep it's not like this is
the only GTX 10-7 you can buy either
there are many many alternatives at very
compelling price points
how much even is this car like 600 bucks
Oh 399 I need to stop fact-checking
myself okay well if you think those
arguments have collapsed on themselves
here is one undeniable reason why you
should not buy this card it's pretty
obvious I got you cornered you ready for
this there's a huge typo on the card and
in two places look I found them they
didn't spell galaxy correctly I guess I
didn't have room for the why nope seems
like a half
wait you're saying that the name of the
company is Galax with without a y okay
okay
so what if my points don't make sense I
don't even care if it's affordable
offered in black or white modestly
overclocked out of the box or built to
last
I just I'm just right cuz this is
YouTube and I do what I want that
YouTube logic yes I put the link to this
card in the video's description only
because I think that once you click on
it you'll see the light possibly okay
more than likely not but that's all that
I've got be sure to give this video a
thumbs up if you thought it was cool
give it a thumbs down if you do feel
like a bit off Sodor if you hate
everything about life be sure to click
that subscribe button if you haven't
already take your time stay tuned for
another giveaway not just this card here
I did say I was giving away this this
particular card this exact card here is
gonna go to one lucky winner doesn't
matter where you live in the world click
this card right here not this card that
this card if you're interested in
learning more about that I'm also giving
away something else even better stay
tuned for that this is Salazar studio
thanks for learning with this
time
