fact you could pick it up for just over
260 US dollars a few days ago makes it
an even better bargain than it already
was now right off the bat I know what
some of you are thinking Greg it is an
AMD graphics card and it's not even from
there rx Polaris lineup which means it's
going to be very power hungry and it's
going to run pretty hot
well yeah it's going to run pretty hot
in it will demand a bit more power than
the typical modern graphics card if you
will this card is a 275 watt TDP
graphics card that's not even total
power draw it's actually going to be a
bit more than that that's just the
amount of power that's dissipated in the
form of heat nonetheless for 260 or so
US dollars you might be able to find it
still for about 300 bucks if you find it
in the right place which I still think
at that point you should buy it if
you're looking for a card around $300
it's a big jump between the rx 480 and
something like a gtx 1070 you know
that's that's an extra 140 or so US
dollars and it's hard to make that kind
of leap so why not pay 60 more bucks and
end up with a card that performs
similarly yeah I set it similarly to the
gtx 1070 don't believe me I'll show you
the benchmarks in this video this
sapphire natural variant of the Fury is
bulky and there's a reason for that the
GPU the MOSFETs the RAM they all get
very hot especially when it comes to
stuff that's not from Polaris's lineup
with AMD this will still get to easily
80 degrees Celsius under full load if
you don't a cooler like this to back it
up now speaking of temperatures this
particular car doesn't get above 75 C
that is good news that's actually not
much hotter at all than my gtx 1070 EVGA
ACX 3.0 card that i use for comparison
in this video that card gets to about 73
74 C with its normal fan curve as does
this under full load with its normal fan
curve something extra that this court
has that my particular variant of the
gtx 1070 does not have this is
indicative of the differences in
architecture and how old this card is
compared to the 1070 an extra 8 pin
power connector this card is very power
hungry it's been reported that when
unlocked and overclocked an r9 fury like
this can draw up to 400 watts of power
directly from the wall so I don't
recommend pairing this
with a rig sporting anything less than
about a 700 watt power supply and if
you're overclocking severely something
like a 6800 K I would say 800 is your
safe zone there if you're doing I don't
know if you're doing some kind of build
those 600 watt power supply including
this card you're going to be really
cutting it close and you definitely
won't be within your efficiency curve
the fans themselves will always stay on
they'll be relatively inaudible until
you came for about 10 or 15 minutes
you'll start to hear a little whistle
blowing in your case but don't mistake
that for coil whine which this card is
also notorious for you could definitely
hear it and it's a weird sound too it's
not it's not just your typical
high-pitched coil line coil whine to use
me this thing can can really change
pitches on you in a heartbeat it's it's
kind of sketchy when you when you're
just playing a game and maybe you're in
between loading screens and your
framerate shoots way up this card will
scream don't freak out though that is
normal it's just in the nature of the
card how it's designed other than that I
don't think there's anything else I
would like to say about the card it is
beautiful its well-designed it's got a
nice backplate triple fan design again -
8 pin power connectors keep that in mind
we're going to go ahead and put it
head-to-head against the GTX 970 first
up on our benchmarking list I just ran
Unigine Heaven benchmark and here are
the results right away you can tell the
gtx 1070 is the better card all around
about a 25 FPS difference on average I
included the maxes in this only to show
the disparity between the two but the
other benchmarks you'll see here won't
include maxes just because they're there
they don't really say much at all
something else to notice here the r9
Furies minimum frame rate dropped to 0
literally the game out of a game but the
benchmark froze for a few seconds I
wasn't sure if that was a driver issue
or not but nonetheless it's what
happened during the benchmark and that's
why it's included in the graph now if
you check out the frame rate trend for
the heaven benchmark you notice there
are a few framerate spikes here and here
as well as here this one's not as
noticeable but this is something that
the 1070 is not experienced that the r9
fury did this could perhaps be just a
driver optimisation error and definitely
accounts for the zero FPS on the
previous graph but let's move on to
games first up as always GTA 5 + + 4
18:40 pmax settings no anti-aliasing and
no advanced graphics the r9 fury closed
the lead a bit here 85 frames per second
on average for it and 100 FPS for the
GTX 1070 our minimum showed a similar
disparity 59 frames per second for the
fury and 71 for the 1070 he's still nice
to see that the fury kept well within
the 60 FPS boundary even on the minimums
when max settings were engaged and
something I handed out on Twitter the
seconds per frame chart you'll see the
time on the y-axis in milliseconds and
you want to look in this case for a
frame time anywhere from between 10 to
15 milliseconds this is the time it
takes for each frame to load on screen
and for reference the 60 Hertz monitor
requires your frame to be pushed to the
monitor every sixteen point six or so
milliseconds you get that by dividing
one over 60 and that's what we see
explicitly with a 1070 the r9 fury lags
a bit behind in most cases but still
relatively consistent we did see one
sharp spike in the GTX 10 70s here by
the way you're looking for lower frame
times in this regard having a lower
overall trend line is better next I
wanted to test a DirectX 12 title
because it is no secret by this point
that AMD graphics cards favor the new
API is particularly Vulcan and DirectX
12 and can even give them additional
edges to boost them above their Nvidia
counterparts even the ones that are in
the price bracket above them for more on
why GC and Architecture favors DirectX
12 check out this video right here I
recommend watching that before you see
the next graph and here it is check that
out the r9 fury held on and even beat
out the gtx 1070 when it came to the
normal benchmarking runs the medium and
heavy benchmarks tilted ever so slightly
in favor of the gtx 1070 just barely by
the way and look at that average forty
two point three versus forty two point
seven these two cards were literally
neck-and-neck and when you consider that
the r9 fury is about a hundred bucks
cheaper than the gtx 1070 well what a
bargain when it comes to DirectX 12 and
I would say the same for Vulcan titles
you could go back as far as the r9 290x
and find that it could be even the gtx
980ti in some direct x12 and vulcan
titles simply by nature of its GC and
architecture but let's move on to our
last official benchmark
filled one by request I've been
benchmarking in conquest modus because
that seems to be the most intensive of
all the different game modes in the
Sinai desert at 1440p using the ultra
graphics preset the r9 fury still did
not lag far behind the gtx 1070 also I
did not benchmark in direct x12 mode for
this game only DirectX 11 so I expect
that had I benchmarked in the 12 API the
AMD r9 fair would have closed that gap
even more i will save a separate
benchmarking video strictly for DirectX
12 titles and we'll do some head to
heads between the Fury the gtx 1070
maybe 2/10 70's and sli and something
like maybe an RX 480 let me know in the
comments below what you'd like to see in
that mashup but back to the benchmark
the average frame rate for the r9 Fury
was about 40 6.2 FPS 48 point 7 for the
gtx 1070 again only about a two and a
half frame disparity there and those
minimums oh those minimums so close the
fury almost had the gtx 1070 we came to
the minimums something that would have
brought up the average overall would
have been the maximum frame rate for the
Fury but those were neck-and-neck as
well something else to note the r9
Furies drivers were a bit hectic I had a
few game crashes a few d3d
driver errors things of that sort I
basically uninstalled all of the drivers
and then reinstalled them again and that
appeared to fix the problem but I still
had a few issues just with how some of
the recording apps I was using and some
of the benchmarking apps were
conflicting with the games only happened
for the fury did not happen at all for
the gtx 1070 that's probably just the
nature of having a new card versus an
older card which tends to be left in the
dust in terms of driver updates all in
all though I do think the r9 Fury is a
great bargain I mean you're only paying
even if you pay 300 bucks for this car
which I think you get it for cheaper
we'll check the links in the video's
description but I do think you get this
card for under 300 bucks
especially if you're willing to wait a
bit and kind of play the market right
but for under 300 bucks this card is an
absolute steal it's why I bought one
just to kind of prove my own point I
think that you should too if you're
looking for a card around 300 bucks
you're not willing to spend $400 on a
card and you think that $200 graphics
card price range really isn't for you
this card is better than an Rx 480 I've
owned
both cards I've tested both this card is
definitely better than that even though
it does demand a bit more power it's a
compromise that I'm personally willing
to make for the sake of gaining more
frames running a bit hotter but whatever
more frames if you have any questions
comments or concerns be sure to leave
those in the box below be sure to give
this video a thumbs up
not to thumbs up because that would just
be an anti thumbs up it would just
disappear if you thought it was cool
give the thumbs down if you do feel a
bit opposite or if you hate everything
about life be sure to click the
subscribe button if you haven't already
I'll wait for you go ahead pick a time
I'll catch you in the next video if you
haven't already checked out the giveaway
video another gtx 1070 i am giving away

all I need to do is actually not a lot
at all just follow me on Twitter
Instagram or Facebook and you'll be
