concerned because I don't know if we're
actually y know I'd do something stupid
oh well we're alive I got the lie I got
the pop-out chat I'm not seeing anybody
yet oh yeah
YouTube YouTube loves us YouTube screwed
us man yeah for sure it's still blank
like this is so weird usually it's
flooded with people by now what's going
on now I Drive the wrong chat okay
oh no we're good hey man just got a push
notification
I'm not bang live yes - hi what's up
Jake Jack not Jason might still whacked
out I don't know what's it says we're
offline on the stream now option
oh we're live bro yes they are we live
on the events thing yeah we created an
event again yeah but that's the stream
now doesn't work with Google Hangouts
okay we have a hundred and forty-three
likes through 184 watching you
so I guess YouTube isn't 196 there we go
YouTube did something yeah very
interesting um anyway as the title of
this video suggests for our second
after-hours live stream on the Sunday
night YouTube is bending us over and we
have proof of that actually right now
will you want to tell us what you just
experienced
yeah actually I'll show it to them but
all my passwords it's pretty good pull
this up here what's up Greg love your
content yo ace ghost is KY whatever that
means
Rob it going on I'm gonna pull it up and
just pause the livestream so that I can
see what's going on oh yeah
Oh see it doesn't it doesn't show it
when it switches for me looking on the
light on the hangouts but it switches on
the live feed which is at least it does
that yeah give me one second pull the
thing up so you can show them our
monetization status the swears yeah
Will's gonna pull up turbo mode right
now you're gonna see uh you see us
getting royally screwed over here live
so hash to have YouTube is killing
itself that's what I'm talking about
I like that it's just Teta I like that
so
basically what you're about to see is
the epitome of YouTube in its current
state I know a lot of people a lot of
the bigger channels not necessarily tech
channels were saying that this happened
in the past and now the other channels
that aren't as consumer unfriendly are
being hit hard by it now that I don't
see why that even has to be the case I
mean if you're if you want an algorithm
to kind of teach itself how about
letting it teach itself on the content
that actually needs to be you know
censored to some extent or you know
provided with limited ads but I can tell
you I don't think I've ever done
anything on this channel that would
provide really really questionable
content for advertisers so it's just
really strange that we're all being hit
by this so hard now so it was harder
than others ah ground box getting it
really hard poor Steve I feel sorry for
that guy can see what you really are Liz
benchmarking stuff I know how tough that
is he's doing a lot of work is that it's
been over right there yep so check this
out guys so this is the live stream
we're on right now all right so we
literally just created this live stream
and here's what it says limited or no
ads due to content identified it's not
suitable for MIT advertisers your videos
or your video remains fully playable and
is eligible to earn subscription revenue
from YouTube Brett however the live
streams you know obviously don't make a
lot of revenue on the YouTube side but
it's it's this is more of a principle
and so it's kind of hilarious that you
know this is instantly this is instantly
be monetized as a live stream now you
know it could be because I put YouTube
is killing itself right that's probably
it
but at the same time you know we have
tons of other videos that we upload all
the time that don't have any absolutely
anything right like you know could be a
PC build or something like that and
we've gone through the transcripts and
gone through everything looking for
something you know like a keyword or
something you know maybe we thought okay
you know Google's where is YouTube's you
know closed captioning system might have
you know done something or you know or
misinterpreted something we said and
know like we look we look through it
right
so says why did this happen advertisers
avoid placing ads on videos that don't
align with their brand for example they
may choose not to advertise on content
that's sexually suggestive including bad
language or it's considered
controversial so I guess you have a lot
of have an opinion anymore on the
Internet
that's as far as YouTube is concerned if
you think ah right I mean automated
system got this wrong and your video is
suitable for all advertisers you can
request a manual review that's great you
can request a manual review it takes
about two days yeah usually most of the
time and the issue is not so much for us
but for smaller creators I think they
have a limit right Greg gets it what is
it tonight ten thousand it's at ten
thousand subscribers
no no I think it's the video has to get
10,000 views before they'll review it
I've seen I've seen YouTube team YouTube
on Twitter commenting the it regardless
of your view count you can file for for
manual review so I don't know if it's
like a subscription cutoff or if it's a
new cutoff or if they're just kind of
switching out both I have no clue I mean
neither of them really pertain to our
channel thankfully but I can imagine if
this had happened a year and a half ago
I don't think we would be here at this
point because there's no way I can have
made a you know I you know in any money
I would have been pretty discouraged me
the reason why I do this because I love
it but have to make a living off of it
I'm literally doing this full-time yeah
for the people who are who are doing
this on a smaller scale which you know
everyone's gonna start from from zero
Suggs they're hammered now I know people
are saying like oh it's the words
YouTube and killing or like killing
itself but might think it's like suicide
or something but here's the thing like
the algorithm is pretty much as dumb as
a box of rocks because if it really took
the time to analyze all of our content
and compiled some sort of like mini
database our videos in particular they
would know that none of our keywords
have ever suggested anything like that
and they would know that you know what
we're talking about here in the context
of the title in its entirety is in
regards to YouTube so it doesn't matter
if it says killing itself that's not the
point the idea is not that hey it says
killing itself so that's bad that should
not be the cutoff it should have to read
the whole title basically and say okay
YouTube is the subject killing itself is
the action but obviously YouTube is not
an animate object so it's okay the
algorithm is not smart period well
and you know they quote machine learning
deep Q&amp;amp;A you know artificial
intelligence and and the whole point of
those technologies is to be able to you
know analyze things on a cognitive level
right it's it's not a yes or no it's
supposed to be you know a complex answer
based on a lot of data so you know when
you're when they call it a self learning
algorithm right like Logan Morgan
whatever your name is pointed out you
know you get into these issues of well
is it really learning because we haven't
really seen any increase and you know
we've actually seen an increase in
videos getting demonetised in the last
probably sixty days right I think you
know every week out of the four to five
videos I think about you know three or
four of them hit demonetised and we have
to request a manual review and what that
does is you know we we're not getting
any ad revenue on those during those two
days which is usually you know at least
for a subscriber base right like when
all of you are watching it that's when
the majority of the views come in now if
one of those videos happens to rank for
a keyword then you know we'll get that
revenue later on you know once they
review it but YouTube doesn't come back
and say oh well sorry you were right
we shouldn't have be monetized you so
we're gonna you know give you that money
back and so it's not even it's not even
really necessarily targeting us so much
as it is smaller creators right who you
know maybe like I can't for numbers out
for you to Terms of Service but you know
people who barely make enough to get by
to pay their expenses whatever using the
YouTube channel all of the sudden now
you know the revenues cut in half or the
revenues cut in the third you know so
yeah there's a lot of issues like this
that you know they just haven't done
David Sullivan Solomon masca says he
says I'm a gaming YouTube channel and I
was fully demonetized until I hit 10k
views over the history of the channel
fully so maybe maybe they're talking
like channel views I don't know yeah
there used to so YouTube actually back
in the good old days of YouTube right
the around 2009/2010 they opened up the
partner program and so to apply for the
partner program I believe you had to
have 10,000 subscribers
or something along those lines or maybe
it's 10,000 views and you could apply it
was an application process right so
everybody now can add a an adsense
account to their to their YouTube
channel and you know make money off of
videos that reach certain thresholds
right whether it's 10,000 channel views
or or whatever but it used to be a lot
smaller so they opened it up they open
the floodgates and then now they're
trying to step back because we'll be at
apocalypse the apocalypse 2.0 right with
YouTube kids you know and all that sort
of stuff I wonder like think about so
the algorithm if we assume it's just
like completely work based right it's
just doing a word search it's probably
using some sort of closed captioning
probably using built-in closed
captioning to set off flags I wouldn't
blame them for doing so but still the
closed captioning system isn't perfect
and on top of that it's using keywords
and tags
more than likely so like the title of
this video for instance set this one off
right away literally like right away
there was no delay sometimes our videos
get to monetize after like a couple
hours which pisses me off because I'm
not checking by then like I'm checking
right away or I'm checking the next day
after I've uploaded it unlisted then
I'll go back and see if it's unless or
demonetized even then after about a day
I'll publish it and then somehow some
couple hours later it'll be monetized
then what I really want to know though
is okay so let's say we submit for
manual review is anybody because if
those are those are people doing that
people are actually watching the videos
and then you know and either giving them
full monetization set us again or
rebuking it are those people going back
to the AI whatever that may be and
saying hey you did this incorrectly like
is there some sort of manual input to
the to the artificial intelligence to
tell it hey you screwed up you need to
know that you messed up so you don't do
this again this doesn't seem like that's
happening is it just keeps happening
over and over to some people what's
happening in every single video you know
yeah and I you know one thing that
happened to us and I mean if you look at
our channel right on social blade or
anything like that you'll see this and
about I think was August we went from
you know uploading a video and the
average it could be enough you know it
could be a video of you know Greg doing
nothing but standing at the camera or
something and it
get you know 80,000 views or something
like that and and we can easily predict
that okay this video will probably get a
hundred thousand views or so and you
know five thousand comments or something
like that now if you go and look at the
videos on the channel after August the
view counts dropped into a third and
what we found out is people tweeting at
us and all that sort of thing YouTube's
not even putting the videos in the
subscription box anymore and a lot of
people have predicted that the reason
for that is because if you don't watch
us you know if you don't watch a science
studio video in a week or say Greg goes
on vacation for a week and doesn't
upload one then you know we have this
problem of well YouTube says okay well
if you haven't watched a video in a week
from this channel and you're on the
website every day then you're probably
not interested right so if for example
if we uploaded one video a week but then
you saw the thumbnail on the you know
the caption of that or the title of the
video and you're like I don't wanna
watch this one then next week are you
gonna get that in your subscription box
right and there's no transparency
there's no there's no rules to follow
and you know I get the you know on the
YouTube kids side on the YouTube kids
side they said okay well we're not going
to tell you what the guidelines are and
in that makes sense right because if you
went to people who are manipulating the
YouTube kids algorithms which are pretty
similar I think to the YouTube the
normal YouTube's algorithms to get these
videos ranked for kids watching on an
iPad for example right like they're
gonna sit there and watch the ad and
they'll sit there and look at their iPad
for two hours right and they're just
letting you know YouTube's algorithm
tell it you know show the kid whatever
it wants because it's going to use the
related videos but there's there's sort
of there's no whitelist there's nothing
right look if you even look at Casey and
I staefel DeFranco all of these people
to this day are still dealing with
videos getting be monetized right now
they've diversified their income to the
point where I don't think it really
matters for them at least not as much as
smaller you know smaller creators but
you know when you get into the situation
of you know you're like I think I forgot
who used as an example but I'll watch
the video the other day oh it's still on
your face sorry I turn the yeah I
realize that but you get to the you get
to the idea
that you know YouTube kids or not
YouTube kids but you know this whole
thing about you know if they're not
gonna show them the subscription box
like what what do we have to do right
like what are the one of the
requirements what are the rules or you
know if they don't want to give you an
exact guideline because YouTube's kids
for example they don't want people
manipulating it showing stuff to
children but there's no whitelist kc9
staff Allah Franco they're not on a
whitelist right they've never uploaded a
video that has like legitimately been
you know taken down right at least not
in the last couple of years so you know
where is that right I think he's a nice
that put out a tweet or a video or I
think was a tweet and YouTube responded
and he basically he said you know why
don't you put a whitelist type of thing
right or you know if the channel has
over a hundred thousand subscribers
manually review it before you remove it
and YouTube's response was like yeah
sorry our algorithms learning but no
it's too many you know too much too many
human resources involved so yeah I mean
they be monetize it and then they don't
pay you back for that revenue and so I
mean that's you know gonna hurt you know
I think the number one job for
Millennials or whatever everybody wants
to be a youtuber social-media influencer
or something like that and I kind of see
the future being that you know I think
we're gonna see another platform pop up
that's gonna you know try to take away
you know at least the influence your
side not so much maybe the mass video
uploads but you know the people who are
on vine when vine shut down right a lot
of them shifted over YouTube a lot of
them shifted over to other platforms and
I think you'll see another platform pop
up that does monetization really well
and that might be Facebook right
Facebook has a really good video
algorithm right now but they don't
really have any monetization involved
and I think that as soon as YouTube or
Facebook flips that switch and says okay
well if you have this many channel or
this many you know likes on Facebook and
you know they set up some sort of
criteria to say okay here's what you
need right in order to earn money on the
platform I think you'll see Facebook
blow up as a you know as a monetization
monitor from the monetization standpoint
right yeah I feel I feel like
I'm just picturing myself a year and a
half two years ago in this situation
like this is this is one of those no no
this is one of those like really really
discouraging things that I think it's
gonna really wash out a lot of the
channels a lot of the smaller channels
and it probably would have watched us
out to at the same time he look we can
we could probably get away as I say this
but I'm not certain but we could
probably do monetize every single video
and maybe squeak by with just ad revenue
from companies that pay for spots for
like sponsored spots it's iffy I don't
know if we could do it if we'd be
relying a lot more on those companies
which I don't think is a good thing but
we could you know there's enough there's
a possibility there if everything else
fails we might still have that the
difference though is that the smaller
channels that don't have I mean maybe
they're getting stuff for free from
companies and good for them for that but
they're not getting paid you know and
like look you know a case or a
motherboard that's not cash so even if
you wanted to sell everything you were
getting for free from these companies
there's no way you'd be able to to keep
this up so it's that's where it's really
hammering people is those that had I
would say around 10,000 subs or so that
are like just now getting rolling like
you hit that 10k Mork and you're like
boom I got five digits let's keep going
that's where you that's where you
explode
we went from 10k to 100k in like four
months or something like that was like
really fast we grew the most during that
time and YouTube favors of smaller
channels in that sensor used to but
there's no way that there's no way that
I could have done this a year or two
years ago if this had happened I mean it
unless they found a way to Ramana ties
these videos within six or eight hours
you could probably get away with
uploading videos away in advance but
then again if you're a small channel
you're a one-person team so getting that
ahead in the first place is already a
feat in itself and if you're a full-time
student or maybe have a job on the side
because YouTube at 10,000 subs isn't
gonna pay for crap then you know you've
you've got to really find a way to
leverage your time so I don't my people
keep suggesting flute playing oboe flute
playing I everyone go to flip plain I
mean
eventually and I think floatplane is
going to be one of those things that is
supplemental to YouTube right or
whatever platform you end up on but so I
pulled this up right this is socialblade
this is a platform that allows you to I
guess view in-depth statistics this is
public I'm not logged into an account
I'm not authenticated I'm not showing
you anything that's not public but you
can go to socialblade.com totally not a
sponsored this is probably the largest
analytics platform
I guess third-party analytics platform
for YouTube right and their data they
estimate a lot of things right so the
the earnings they all is tomato all of
this right the subscribers these are
accurate right so they monitor channels
and I'm sure some of you guys are
familiar with this but if you're not I
definitely you should definitely check
it out you can enter any youtubers name
up here they also support other
platforms twitch Instagram and Twitter
but if you scroll down and look right
you can go through here and just look at
the monthly views right and these are
pretty accurate I don't I don't really
know where they get their data from I'm
assuming YouTube's API but anyway you
can you can see that you can see
basically right here right this is
August first right and I can't tell you
what these numbers are because I haven't
looked at them and in our actual YouTube
analytics but if you look at it
afterwards this is a huge drop right
this is what we're talking about and
this this one drop for us right I don't
think these drops are necessarily
accurate because I don't really remember
any of any of this happening necessarily
but I know that you know this right here
is definitely close to accurate I don't
know the numbers but I know the trend
right we're in our view counts cut cut
and we don't know why we don't know what
we did or what we didn't do or the only
thing that we do know is that you know
people tweeted us Facebook message with
us or whatever telling us hey I'm not
getting your videos in your sub box
right even friends and luckily for us
you know they're like oh yeah right stop
doing that I haven't seen his videos on
YouTube lately and and you know this is
the sort of thing right
so yeah I mean if you haven't looked at
this website I definitely think you
should check it out you can even look at
if you've seen some of these YouTube
videos where people are you know talking
about arms 500,000 subscribers or a
million subscribers and they're watching
like a live subscriber count' it's
usually this website because it keeps it
accurate so yeah I mean I think these
guys should check this out just look at
your favorite youtubers and you know
just kind of look around yeah Tony
thanks for the Tony you don't have to
donate to get our intensity he just text
me but Tony makes a good point so he is
sorry I'm like and that's like some
really weird people in the chat trying
to monitor again so tony was saying you
know like even this like his channel is
not super big yet but even he's getting
hit by it and he uploads maybe one a
week you know around that he's working
full-time elsewhere so you know that's
what I was saying like it's gonna really
hit the people hard who aren't doing it
full-time already right and the thing is
and this kind of as a separate topic but
I agree with him the diversity of
channels on YouTube like no doubt the
tech tubers space is super saturated
like at this point I would you would
have to really find a niche if you
wanted to be a tech tuber right now
because so many people are doing either
the same thing or something pretty darn
close to it and that's why I've kind of
if you've noticed on the channel kind of
digress from not just reviewing tech and
building pcs but also explaining what
things work how they were talking about
some really weird subjects because that
there's not a lot of that right now
there might be because I just said this
but right now there's not and that's
kind of where our Nicias at this point
but if you just want to be a regular
oral PC builder or tech reviewer the
best of luck I mean if it's tough but
here's here's the good thing and this is
why I'm still okay with how it is people
are oh it's sooo sad it's so saturated
now you know the competition is is so
high that's the point I'm glad that
there is competition I see people all
the time kind of taking little ideas
from each other like I take a lot of
like video ideas like I really like
looking at a Dimitri Hardware Canucks
videos I get a lot of like my my tips
him from just his videos his to toriel's
but that's the point so if you actually
take the time to watch your competition
even though I wouldn't call any of the
guys up there my competitors we just we
love doing the same thing then you can
really kind of feed off of each other
and improve your videos in the long run
and how you present products and how you
present reviews so I'm okay with how it
is right now I've never really
complained about how dense the tech
tuber space is on YouTube but it almost
seems like YouTube is doing this on
purpose to limit the number of people in
each space and I don't know why tech
tubers are are really getting hit hard
by this as well I mean we review tech
like what's subjective I mean there's
their subjectivity but like what is what
is I guess I want to say like
controversial about tech reviews other
than the fact that you might see an LG
ad in front of a Samsung product review
who cares Samsung knows that they're
paying for the actual video or that
they're they're sending the product for
a review they're not paying for the ad
in front of the video that you're about
to see that's a totally separate thing
and they go to YouTube for that they
want to add in our videos they go to us
so there's two different outlets there
the fact that they have that option is
great but the idea that they're
censoring videos based on these weird
keywords and discouraging smaller
channels is a that I mean that's I could
talk about it for days but I just think
that it's pure trash and I can say that
we are really lucky to be on the other
side of this right now because while
we're getting hit - I know we're not
getting hit nearly as hard as some of
the other guys out there they're getting
hammered by it every now and then we get
a video to monetize this live stream was
to monetize right way but you know some
of them are getting hit just every
single video it's so bad yeah and I mean
you know the Greg's right right I mean
we're at the point now where you know
even if YouTube decided to completely
ban our Adsense account right that we
have enough company sponsors
relationships that we've built up that
we we'd be okay but you know the the
small youtuber who's making just enough
to pay the rent eat food whatever and
they're trying to you know make
this there's you know the next big thing
for them to be able to actually build a
brand behind it you know if they lose
you their Adsense revenue they're
screwed basically right like they don't
have a backup I saw one of you guys talk
about affiliate revenue for tech tubers
that's huge affiliate revenue especially
through Amazon Newegg those sort of
websites when you guys use our Amazon
links or anything that's in the in the
description is usually an affiliate link
we get a kickback from it doesn't cost
you anything and so a lot of people do
that but then when you look at YouTube
verticals that don't necessarily you
know get I guess you know tech tuber
it's easy to do that because if you talk
about processor then you can put an
affiliate link to buy that right and so
the idea there is that a lot of the
people who are searching for that video
are gonna end up buying that processor
and if you help them do it then you can
get a small kickback but then when you
look at youtubers like lifestyle
vloggers and those sort of people that
are you know maybe around the 200,000
sub mark or so they're they're at the
point where you know they may not have
those relationships built up with
companies or they don't have a niche or
something that they're they're targeting
so yeah I mean it's crazy my Amazon link
is set to gamers Nexus Gigi bro I'll be
sure to let Steve know about that one
yeah somebody said I want to read this
because this is something else is that
pretty interesting so I hate window says
nobody on YouTube should get money from
YouTube itself everybody can upload
videos up to 4k for free normally
uploader should pay for this service so
there is an exchange going on here that
you have to consider alright some
channels very small channels usually
will not be able to monetize so they're
uploading content and taking advantage
of YouTube servers or storage and
YouTube is still probably planting ads
in there the people that don't have a
huge fan base or that don't have the
traffic are probably just taking
advantage of YouTube's system but I
wouldn't even call it I mean you're just
uploading content YouTube allows you to
do it so they're not really taking
advantage of it because they're able to
do it right
YouTube is banking on people getting big
and when channels get big YouTube makes
so there is an exchange it should not be
a free service for me to upload videos
and not have the option to monetize my
content or at least to get a small
kickback from the videos that I upload
when they decide to plant ads in front
of my videos it's a it's an agreement
you literally check when you say
monetize my video you agree for YouTube
to put ads in front of your videos and
for you to get a small kickback from
those ads like you're making just like
shillings on the dollar I mean these are
these are tiny tiny percentages the idea
is YouTube makes a lot of money you make
some money the difference is YouTube's
making more of it because their
infrastructure is much greater than any
tech tuber out there they're making you
know they they have all these servers
all this infrastructure to to maintain
and long run that's a lot of a lot of
money to do to use and in the absence
I'd write like if you if you're not
eligible
so YouTube's three but it's free it's
it's almost freemium right there there
are no paid services on YouTube
other than the p-channel recently got
rid of and YouTube red and I guess
YouTube TV now but the idea there I mean
there's no such thing as a free lunch
right like economics 101 YouTube makes
more money like I think the the revenue
split would that's it I since I want to
say it's 55 percent that's what
Facebook's is I'm not exactly sure so
don't quote me on that but if you're not
eligible to get ads on YouTube right if
you have a channel with under ten
thousand views or ten thousand
subscribers or whatever the
qualifications are YouTube is still
putting ads in front of your video and
they're just making the revenue right
like you're not getting anything so it's
more it's more like you're opting in to
collect portion of the money as an
incentive to continue producing content
because you're you know whatever the
video is I think most of the most of the
revenue for YouTube actually comes from
people who aren't huge right not the
low-mid Paul's or you know any of them
right most of the content comes from
smaller creators and they make a ton of
revenue off of that and they don't split
it with anybody they just monetize your
video because they want to you and their
YouTube and that's part of the service
yeah
that's like yeah I didn't think about
that yeah there are I mean then placing
ads in front of your videos it's kind of
like a default thing they're not
expecting to make a lot of money from
you if you're really small you're
probably not gonna have a lot of these
unless your video goes viral for it you
said I thought it was 60% to YouTube and
40% of the creator' it might be I'm not
100% sure on the exact split I know they
take more though I know they take more
yeah it's over 50% for them the gamer
says my ad rates are about $2 for every
1000 views after YouTube gets their cut
so that dunkey the gamer you're talking
about your CPM being $2 I actually don't
think you're supposed to talk about that
decade Quinn to Taryn thanks for the for
the 5 Canadian he says well the Greg is
it a bad time to try and start a channel
or should I wait and see how it all
plays out well if it plays out
bad I mean then you didn't really lose
anything but if it happens to play out
good and let's say this ad pocalypse
thing go this way
eventually the algorithms start favoring
small channels again some of them are
being favored right now but very few are
I mean we're not being favored by the
algorithm right xx as YouTube doesn't
place ads on videos with monetization
disabled at all there they aren't
advertising on those tiny creators so
they're not advert if if we were to
upload a video and market is not
monetized ads won't show up but if you
are a just a normal YouTube creator you
know and and I might be wrong you might
be right but I think I'm gonna stick
with my idea that they do but I'm pretty
sure off the researcher I don't want to
say you're wrong
tick tock Texas will that doesn't make a
whole lot of sense what doesn't make a
whole lot of sense
Josh we weren't saying our channel is
small it's not over we weren't saying
our we were talking about channels that
have you know relatively small around
10k subs or less yeah and we compare
ourselves to like big we're talking
about big channels right like we don't
well we don't make enough money by any
means to be able to hire a staff of 30
and a big fancy office and hoverboards
for everybody in free candy but you know
like that's that's that's kind of what
our comparison is right there's plenty
of youtubers you make millions of
dollars plenty you make $10 a month
there's plenty you don't make any and
then there's everybody in between
Bob says this one have to watch the
whole pre-bid ad for sign sudha to get
moolah so the answer to that is no we'll
do you know if it matters if they click
skip five seconds in verses they watch
the entire ad is that is the revenue
different yeah so I we can't sit here
until you do watch our ads don't watch
our ads but objectively speaking right I
think that the way it works
and whatever the kid's name might
correct me again but I think that when
you watch an ad if it's a skippable ad
and like if I so I do a lot of media
buys right like my day job sort of thing
I do a lot of media marketing for
healthcare organizations so when we buy
YouTube ads for example if somebody
skips the ad we don't have to pay we pay
for an impression but we don't pay for
the actual click through on the ad spot
so if you skip the ad it's not actually
paying YouTube a whole lot of money if
you watch the whole lab then I believe
that obviously watch the ad and if you
click the ad then it's it's even more
right so there's there's a click-through
rate a cost per cost per thousand
impressions a cost per thousand views
all that sort of stuff gets calculated
into it so X Ted CX the ones who was
saying that you were so he says no try
it make a fresh channel you don't get
ads if someone right under him says they
don't they may not be like ads
overlaying in your video or on you know
at the beginning of your video but
you'll have ads underneath maybe your
ads have ads on the side or whatever
he's saying that they still implement
ads to some extent but they might not be
the hardcore like 10 second ads or
30-second ads Jesus in front of videos
that aren't gonna get a lot of traffic
yeah yeah it's um except I wouldn't
blame YouTube for doing it it wouldn't
make sense for them not to you right
yeah there's different types right
there's different types of ads there's
the banner ads you see on YouTube videos
there's the pre-rolls there's the post
rolls
there's even mid rolls now the non
skippable pre-rolls which most people
hate because you can't skip them
obviously those are YouTube is phasing
out from what we've we've gotten from
our partner manager at YouTube they're
phasing out the 30-second ads the
30-second pre-roll on Schiphol because
the abandonment rate goes way up right
if you're used to watching a video and
just skipping at five seconds in
you have to watch you know ten more
seconds of an ad or twenty five more
seconds of an ad on a 30-second video
you're just gonna click off the video
most the time or you're gonna refresh
the page trying to get you know not an
ass and so they're they're phasing out I
believe it's Q on a 20-18 they're
phasing out the 30-second ads yeah
someone else is saying so he's still
still denies that you get ads at all
period someone else is saying you still
get banners and whatnot smaller channels
will still get ad banners like there's a
good ways to monetize by the way so you
can disable like pre-roll if you want to
call them that think pre-roll ads or pre
video ads but you can enable banners you
can unable to ads that show up
underneath the video box things like
that so you know I want to also look it
up and kind of see maybe we can talk to
a YouTube yeah we can research it I mean
you know it's all out there
you can skip them get that block it's
like yeah that's what we talked this
last night about 6065 percent of you or
so according to our analytics are using
some sort of ad blocker which means that
we make zero dollars and it also means
that YouTube makes zero dollars by the
way yeah screw YouTube
yeah you go that's a way to get a thing
out on the stream
oh yeah see now Devon do you have
YouTube red because our vid this live
streams be monetized except for YouTube
red subscribers YouTube Reds will get
them but others won't know YouTube red
shouldn't get any ads right no youtuber
so when they did monetized this live
stream they left monetization on for
YouTube red oh wait so okay then I
thought that that meant we got a portion
of the YouTube red funds I didn't think
we actually I don't think they saw ads
at all yeah I know the YouTube red we'll
see actually I don't know it's good
question I'm pretty sure youtuber I
doesn't get ads okay sorry YouTube
YouTube red monetize because they don't
watch ads right so they're saying that
they get that we get a percentage of
their basically monthly payment per view
it's probably like right nothing but I
mean I'm we're getting something from
that so I'm pretty sure that we're not
getting if you're seeing ads you're
probably seeing them because some of
those advertisers are still deemed
worthy that or weird is not getting
period and guess what there's no like
fine print that says exactly what we're
getting when we're partially or fully
demonetised in fact it's not even
explicit as to the extent of which were
demonetized are we partially are we like
mostly to monetize you're like are you
completely cutting off ads or our
Adsense you know like what's what's
going on there what's that they're just
being super vague about it and they have
like this automated machine on Twitter
that keeps responding the same way every
time just file for review we'll fix it
for you adventures in fabrication says I
never get ads unread
I guess he's saying he's on YouTube
bread I actually think that YouTube
bread like between our CPM revenues on
normal straight Adsense and YouTube red
there isn't a whole lot of difference so
I mean if you're wanting to support
youtubers but you know obviously don't
wanna watch ads YouTube ready I think
it's what $10 a month yeah someone says
you get 25 per 25 cents per view with
YouTube right I can pretty much tell you
that's not that is not correct that is a
vas overestimation my friend no ads on
red it's true Josh matter what you think
a floatplane everybody keeps talking
about floatplane so I think that slow
plane is definitely gonna be I think a
huge platform right I think that line is
is in a position where he he can do it
and I think they'll do it really well
and I think I'll execute on it really
well he has a great team of people that
I think can actually get it done I mean
we've met a couple of them right but I
think that you know I think if anybody
can do it I think he can and but I think
time will tell I think they're still in
early stages of development
I know bit wait got involved with it
when YouTube cut everything off November
first for his paint channel and you know
we'll see what happens but I definitely
think it's going to be something
interesting to you know see what happens
with and definitely jump on at some
point Bob Flanders donated $2 says let's
see if my wife asked about this $2
somebody watches 30 to 50 YouTube videos
a day red is a steal yeah I got a lot of
respect for those people I mean you're
basically paying like a it's like
Netflix subscription a lot of people
don't even have cable they just use
Netflix or Hulu and then they kind of
watch that in with YouTube yeah I
haven't came in four years yeah well
they get it you don't have cable that's
right yeah yeah we'll do you deal with
SEO at all dealing with that sense I did
a long time ago yes but there's there's
an organic strategy obviously in a paid
strategy and at this day and age there's
always a hybrid no way I'm paying in
$2.99 a month worldwide what are you
yeah Jedi Katie where do you live that
you don't get rid of curious it includes
a Google Music what but are you done
limited streaming on Google music oh
yeah you might I know that yeah yes they
get six accounts for 15 bucks so you get
six six YouTube accounts that you can
all have a dream with red pretty cool
YouTube red has been massive for me as a
small creator says X busy X whatever I'm
just gonna call you X Dead YouTube
Brad's been a massive massive for me as
a small creator you get a portion of
their watch time from the $10 and my fan
base is much higher than my 500 views
get from ads hmm that's interesting
unlimited music on Google Play thanks
John that's really cool did no no that's
not available in the UK subscriptions
market so United States Australia Mexico
New Zealand and South Korea those are
the five oh wow so it is or it's pretty
small in yeah that's I'd bet you there's
just a bunch of like government
loopholes to get through you know you're
basically introducing yourself as a
media company you says red is irrelevant
I think here in Germany there is no
YouTube red yeah it's like about five
countries or so Canada and up there in
Canada so you say oh right Kumiko Canada
I'm just gonna say Canadia from now on
to piss off all the Canadian okay no
need a not a Canadian appreciate it
scary Terry we appreciate you we really
had no clue what we're gonna talk about
and then we've noticed that video got
the monetized really all right
that is our question that yeah so what
do you guys this is this is sort of a
curiosity standpoint I mean I know what
our analytics say but if you guys are in
chat and there's quite a few of you
what do you how old are you what do you
do for a living if you're a student just
put student I don't need to know all
your detail but you know what do you do
for a living if you're working you know
are you a student do you have a youtube
channel just kind of bombard the chat
I'll try to look as many as I can
other minium yeah so okay so I want to
know why everyone's kind of putting in
their credentials so I know the English
say aluminium right I mean mininum I
guess there's like because we don't have
an eye at the end right it's not in I um
it's in um so is it ni um in England or
is it just like in um and you're just
like stressing the in you connection
they're like yeah the same the only
difference I've seen is an Apple
commercials right if you're gonna sell a
macbook get to talk about you how do you
minions in a or a leaky body whatever
thanks for watching that accident
I will admit out of a minion sounds
cooler than available yeah sounds
cheapest crap and how the mininum sounds
dope so I get it a lot of students in
here yeah students 18 work the corner
says crow
that's funny student 28 software
engineer student student engineer I
think like over half of these uh viewers
or students y'all better watch out
tomorrow's a school day its aluminium
everywhere
y'all are spelling with an I um I others
trolling me worried for a hippie with
almost two thousand seven like a boss
dirt is young by comparison I'm a
director and tech guy at a company in DC
trucker bomb says 32 year old truck
driver well what do you think about the
Tesla semi trucks I'm curious about that
I think they're kind of funny to view
I'm just picturing like electric truck
like because 18 wheelers and semi trucks
in general just huge gas hogs right I
just pump
not a bunch of co2 and crap that
picturing an all-electric semi all lunch
18-wheelers just that's when you know
you're in the future it's so trippy
molybdenum molybdenum right oh look at
that looks like a freak you know what
that looks like yeah it's like the
monorail at Orlando in Disneyworld
yeah apparently the aerodynamic
abilities on it are insane like this I
don't if you can see the mouse but this
panel right here apparently comes like
in and out to like basically be the size
of the truck geez
so it lowers the drag like crazy that's
trippy what is going on the background
what is that whining are you serious
yeah sounded like it sounds like
knickers somebody mechanism steer to 60
in five seconds for a giant semi
shouldn't be illegal y'all see that
friggin Tesla Roadster jeez man
that thing is insane just watching it
take off it looks fake it looks CGI'd
that's what it looks like oh yeah 250
mile an hour top speed I didn't know
that part I gotta sneeze mile an hour
plus oh there's a plus there yeah
they've had 250 in a prototype but they
won't say what the actual top speed is
dude you know how hot those motors are
gotta be it like 250 miles an hour I
mean not just the motors the tires -
jeez they're gonna be burning up on the
road yeah that car sweet yeah it's it's
insane I wish it I wish it didn't have
such a really high back end though like
the back end of it kind of it's like
every other Tesla like the P 100 is the
same thing like the back end just kind
of like slopes off its that there's no
like flat you know trunk and I wish it
if it had a flat trunk it would look
more sporty in my opinion that's the
only thing I would really change without
the thought the Roadster but but it's a
fast car no doubt Steven Hager and box
is fun to listen to
out of mininum Z and H this position
driver is so dumb says trucker bomb
he drives trucks for a living he says
it's dumb
I actually was kind of curious about
that I mean that just seems like a weird
way I feel like they said that you know
you're gonna be able to see the left and
a right just as much but I almost wonder
if you know if you set in the middle of
like a pickup truck right you can't see
anything outside on the left or the
right so I'm kind of wondering how
they're gonna mitigate that what's up
Chris appreciate that donation brah
mkbhd ordered a semi that's funny or we
no no I think he's talking about the
Roadster yeah I did that I think Logan
Paul or somebody like ordered a freaking
semi alaria odds of six twenty eighteen
of the old video they should the monster
vision concept my I owned a Mazda 6
back in high school I was at 2005 oh
yeah
bright red with a spoiler your boy was
he was pulling that front-wheel drive
action let me tell ya whipping that
e-brake getting that severe understeer
1,700 is 3/8 at best everyone's talking
about the RX 1,700 moorthi people are
I'm a fan of techy s City love his
trolling local hardware seller do is
it's kind of like what we were doing
with Craigslist videos you need to get
back into those I know Tony wanted to do
one with Reddit eventually slowly
becoming Alex Jones or does that I say
something that they may seem super like
I mean you supposed to yell really loud
into the camera and talk about the world
coming to noon and talk about like guns
right Walmart ordered 15 semi trucks yes
appreciate that Chris automated electric
semi tractors the future I mean I'm
pretty sure we could just invent those
right now if we wanted I still think
anybody wants to thoughts on surface
book two we'd have to do it one is
putting a Corvette ls3 engine in his
Miata
do it nyada's are like the perfect frame
for anything if the engine is so like
the hood space is just so so Laura get
the v8 sand those things but they got
little for bangers and I'm stock
she's pretty flying power to waiting me
out of those equivalent to
jeez almost 50 a city better sis can be
why is that I guess Center tech Kiev
city is better than you right at what oh
right the yeah but he doesn't do the
same thing I do I mean I called people
one time but I had to delete the video
cuz we had some we had some issues
alright Scooby I'm gonna message uh a
message Brian yeah yeah right hey Tom
what's up Brian dissipated
have you done carbon cleaning on your s5
good point I want to talk about the Z Y
Z so so with FSI engines like feel
stratified engines basically you have a
lot of like carbon buildup on the air
intake manifold and that can drastically
reduce power it basically just clogs the
air intake port and your engine doesn't
get enough oh - and you need to have
that proper air fuel mixture right to
burn the fuel and to get that combustion
going so the less air you have the more
which is it is it rich or lean if it's
rich I think it's rich and fuel so I
think it's I think it's rich when it
doesn't have enough air maybe it's the
opposite basically your engine gets
either rich or lean and I forget which
one it is and you don't you lose power
you can lose up to I think they
documented like 15-20 percent if you go
without carbon cleaning the S 5 so I
think almost every FSI engine from
Audi's like that including I believe the
r8 I'm pretty sure the Rho uses FSI
engine so that over time would still
have carbon cleanup or carbon buildup
issues I haven't cleaned mine I'm pretty
sure out II did it because I looked at
my Carfax and the its rich yeah I
thought it was rich so the CARFAX has a
basically they didn't say carbon buildup
clean they just said that they clean the
air intake manifold or something like
that or air manifold whatever you know
they comes are pretty vague on CARFAX
but I'm pretty sure they did like 60 65
K miles and now I'm at like 72 so I
should be good for another 10 K miles or
so by then I might sell it so we'll see
yeah it gets a case of carbon cleanup or
carbon buildup I keep saying clean up
carbon
buildup happens yeah it happens in every
car I mean anything that burns fuel but
it's especially bad with FSI engines
like it's it's a real issue with the s5
so someone says are you trying to become
like Jay's two cents or more like Linus
tech tips I would hope I don't become
like either of them not to insult either
then I want to be my own channel I don't
want to be like either of them but I
would say I draw I draw a lot of my
inspiration from both a lot of my early
inspiration came from - and now I'm
starting to appreciate the the smaller
but still big channels a really big fan
of Kyle's work of course I like Paul
Paul's just you know straight up
stand-up guy like Paul a lot
I like Jays just blunt kind of just rash
approach to things and and that is
something that not a lot of people like
to be frank and i'm sure he'll admit
that but i appreciate that that's the
way he is so um i would say that i
probably at this point draw a little
more inspiration from jay than i do -
but that's just more or less because
i've already drawn a lot of inspiration
from - and at this point he's so big
like I can't even think will thinks on
that scale but I can't think on that
scale yet I can't think of that like 30
person warehouse level stuff you know I
just I'm one guy in a 3-bedroom
apartment just turned one of my bedrooms
into a film room and you'll see in this
next video coming up I use the green
screen officially for the first time and
I'm just getting kind of into the into
the mix you must be connect Ian can aid
Ian to be like Linus you do minute
science on how Ram works specifically
with a horizon CPU so you want to know
why ran speed matters more or less
horizon CPUs and it doesn't tell okay
I'll take number that interesting but
haha I saw you did there well what 29
inch old tried monitor would you
recommend I owned a 29 inch LG Ultra why
the ug 57 or the LG 57 um something like
that the 58 sout now it's a 75 inch free
single Tour wide monitor 29 inch it's
like 200 bucks or so really cheap I
would recommend that one if you're on a
budget yeah someone said what do we
think about Bitcoin I feel like we get
this conversation never get this
question
yeah this guy said he's been holding for
over a year I bought in 2013 so so you
know you know it's a good way to know or
do I keep making more money type what's
it like eleven five now here yeah at
this point I'm actually not sure what's
gonna happen I think that I've always
had this idea in this theory that as
long as Bitcoin actually caught on or
got a bunch of controversy around it
which it did that you know there's only
21 million bitcoins right so when the
supply runs out I think that's the
critical mass plate I think that you
know the the actual supply of being able
to mine coins runs out in a couple years
or a few years and I think when that
happens you're gonna you're gonna hit a
point where it's either gonna the
scarcity factor is gonna go through
minute it's gonna become you know the
the digital currency that everything
else is based on just like the US dollar
sort of a standard in the world or it's
gonna become a really big flop and
everybody's gonna sell and get scared
I'm curious well how do you how you feel
that just lets somebody comment this and
I've been saying this for a while how do
you feel like about the the people that
say that basically most if not I would
say most not all cryptocurrency but most
cryptocurrency is a sort of Ponzi scheme
it's like a pump and dump thing right
baby pretty much I mean the ones that
really do it bad are the ones that have
a bunch of coins already to themselves
before they even release the thing to
the public yeah you know you can still
prepare beforehand right
yeah cryptocurrency has been around for
a long time I mean even before Bitcoin
it was still a thing but Bitcoin kind of
made it a you know a real thing and I
think the political climate influenced
it a little bit especially the United
States but the US dollar this was in
2008 right so the market markets crashed
everything happened and people are
looking for alternatives to currency so
obviously you guys know that bitcoin is
not held by any government nobody
actually knows who
good point we know him of his is alias
right but we don't know who he actually
is there's been reports that some
governments or whatever have figured out
who he is but just haven't disclosed it
but what's interesting is you know a lot
of these coins now is Bitcoin happened
right and the etherium happened and a
lot of these other alt coins are
starting to pop up and that can be a
good thing but it can also be a really
bad thing because you can get a lot of
scammers or people who basically want to
just download Bitcoin off of github do a
control find and replace everything that
has to do with Bitcoin basically just re
skinning the same coin in the same
technology and then marketing it
differently and so then they hope that
they can get a lot of interest in it
they do what's called an ICO initial
coin offering which is where you pay
mule US dollars in exchange for currency
that doesn't really exist yet so you're
buying part of what they call the pre
mine so before the developer actually
releases the point of the public they
mined some of those coins for themselves
and their team and so that I'm you know
Nico can yeah an IPO ICO can be you know
small as $100 up to millions of millions
of dollars and then they try to get it
on exchanges and get it adopted by
businesses and by huge organizations to
use as an actual currency you're
starting to see a lot of these niche
coins come up which you know a lot of
these niche coins could be worth
something one day you know I'm mining
and experimenting with tons of these
what they're called alt coins and the
idea behind that is that you know maybe
one of them might become you know a coin
for that industry specifically so you
know entire countries people are
building coins just for that country
even though people outside the country
can buy them they're betting on mass
adoption in that country you know in in
vice-versa
someone said dodge coins a certain pet
99% of all of all coins are trash and
will go to zero that's true
you get they're all coins aren't
dangerous I mean they are dangerous but
they're not
they're not all scams so that that's
sort of the how do you do how do you
decide between the two but I will say if
you're getting in a cryptocurrency or
you're curious about how it works
alt coins are the place to start in your
mining because if you can find a coin
that doesn't have a very high difficulty
meaning you need less computing power to
actually find blocks and to actually get
coins then you know you can play with it
and understand how the software works
and test it or even build your own coin
just to play with it but in order for it
to actually get some sort of real
tangible value you have to get it onto
an exchange right and so getting it onto
an exchanges is a really big deal or at
least getting it into one of the top
hundred exchanges is a really big deal
because once that happens those
exchanges move millions of bitcoins a
day and then these investors are willing
to put a few bitcoins towards your
project just to see and you know sort of
like a venture capitalist or I guess
more like an angel investor or they're
willing to throw $100,000 at you just to
see what happens
so the scooby-doo's says a
cryptocurrency doesn't create any value
it's only values and what you give it
okay but you can say the same thing
about our currency system we used to be
on a gold standard but we completely
fabricate our own value like with
respect to other currencies okay it's a
bit more difficult to do that but our
currency is literally what value we give
it we say like milks four bucks a gallon
we're just saying that four bucks is
equivalent to a gallon of milk but two
weeks from now we could say it's eight
bucks well you make any sale no but
you're giving a gallon of milk the value
of eight dollars which dollars don't you
know that's eight dollars doesn't do you
any good it's what you can get for the
eight dollars so all of that is
completely like in our heads as to what
we find is worth also if somebody else
says corn dog corn dog says honestly you
guys need to put your webcam
side-by-side because the whole switching
back and forth thing is giving me a
headache
okay I'm gonna be blunt get over it we
switch like eight times probably entire
live stream unless wills getting like
super click like click e spammy over
there and like switching eight times in
a second I don't think it's that big a
deal that we're switching every two
minutes or so sorry that just bothered
me cuz I didn't think it was that big a
deal corn dog I just cooked it like a
hundred times oh yeah there you go just
spam them oh I'm watching it now oh this
is beautiful
see that's what happens what happens
when you go play about something that
shouldn't be complained about corndog
all right I'm off my high horse now
someone said ow I'm freaking out stop
good oh yes all right all right we got a
catch back up here that's Becca they
won't say anything interesting problem
is liquidity and also BTC it's our
Bitcoin is technically controlled via
Chinese miners I think what I will well
I mean it's kind of true right there's a
lot of ASIC Myers that basically control
the Bitcoin mining industry but that's
also because if you if you go on YouTube
and look up like Chinese Bitcoin
factories or whatever they call them ore
mining farms there are these huge
warehouses with barely any cooling a ton
of ASIC Hardware really cheap or stolen
power like you know it's really cheap to
do for them compared to you know 12%
average per kilowatt here or you know
other developing countries where you're
talking 30 cents a kilowatt-hour it's
it's not crazy what do you guys think of
BTC driving up GPU prices greg has an
opinion on that yeah I'm more let's talk
about like why it's happening not
necessarily like what I think about it I
mean it's whatever it's the market like
I can't blame the market for being the
market if it's a relatively free and
open market someone else says I'm just
kind of funny Tara Drive says and
continue to mine with my gtx 1070
another 1062 get around twelve hundred
dollars in four months of mining so i
really wonder if you're from mining for
four months non-stop 24/7 how much your
power bill was for four months of mining
and he's not doing on a major coin you
wouldn't those carnie 1200 bucks that's
the problem with Bitcoin is it's sort of
on my nibble for most people like even
if you took some of those ten ATT eyes
over there and tried to mine it you
wouldn't get anywhere because ASIC
miners are literally chips built for
mining you know and that's it
and their capacity is extremely higher
extremely
whatever it's huge a you know compared
to a graphics card because it's
literally dedicated for that literally
solving math equations I'm in a dorm so
I don't pay anything for power Patel
says is it worth 30 bucks if I have to
remove if the rebate were 30 bucks by
after a movement sticker and forfeit the
option to return the item that's pretty
messed up like you have to forfeit your
rebate or you have to forfeit your I
assume it's your warranty to get a
rebate so I would just look at the like
objectively the price of the item if
you're getting a thirty dollar rebate
it's probably close to like a hundred
two hundred maybe even three hundred
bucks so yeah I probably wouldn't just
in case you know you can like check
reviews and see how reliable the thing
is but uh that's a pretty crappy shady
thing for a company to do if you have to
void your warranty dude I think rebates
are the biggest scam every other trash I
never got my five dollar Coolermaster
even his back and try to principle like
- it's like two years man it was a hyper
t4 as I bought it myself I mean I was
like they gave it to me but jeez like
you know that and that was the only
rebate that I even filed for because I
thought they were crap before this
proves to me now that they're still crap
so I wouldn't buy a product expecting a
rebate unless you're willing to wait
three or four months and heckle the
company to make sure that you didn't
violate any of the Terms of Service - to
be you know ballot for it they said have
they do you monetize this stream yes
they did
yeah we talked about the beginning of
this lesson you know at about twenty
seconds I've already I've already I've
always got my rebates but seriously you
have to wait three months for ten
dollars if you need to wait three months
for ten dollars you need a better job
yeah like they're banking on it what
somebody I think it was Linus is said
that like for every $10 rebate like the
company is only paying out like three
dollars of that like and overall for the
probably like they're they're probably
paying out 30% or maybe less than that
of the rebates out there because you
have to fill out a paper then you're
usually gonna mail it in like you're
physically mail it in and that's what
they're banking on that you just don't
care to do that not that I blame you but
you know it's just it just makes it look
pretty when you're going to buy the
product oh I can get this back if I do
it you get the product you're satisfied
with it you're like yeah ten bucks isn't
that big a deal yeah there's YouTube
tear cut
stream donations yes the amount of
currency in circulation needs to be
regulated the currency itself needs to
be regulated and empowered by the people
Scooby Doo I spent around 90 thousand
dollars on Bitcoin and got about a
hundred Simon we send me your dress
please
you see me whitey what's your favorite
price to performance GPU I have a video
on that just type in best value CPU GPU
combo I'm not gonna tell you what it is
I'm sure somebody on the stream oh but I
want your currency probably at some
point yeah it's at some point there's a
video on that that we got screwed by the
armored them go check out how many views
I have yeah we got rekt on that people
were asking for that non-stop and it
only got like nineteen thousand views
yeah I got video is on freakin
tessellation that have four times that
number know what's going on yeah guys if
you guys so this is sort of me begging
sauce asking but if you guys want to see
the videos and you know actually be sure
that you're gonna see them next to the
subscribe button I'm sure you've heard
this a hundred times there's a bell if
you click the bell it's gonna send you a
push notification when we upload a video
or go live or anything like that which
it used to do that anyway but I guess
with a saturation of subscription boxes
and that sort of stuff the average
person having a ton of subscriptions
they changed it so if you want to make
sure that you actually get notified then
click a little Bell thing or follow you
know dragging me on Twitter or whatever
you know what we need to do we need to
have like a you know like on twitch when
someone donates they get like all the
bells and whistles go off in the
livestream and like the person's names
like flashing right in front of them we
need to do something like that we're
like if anyone subscribes or donates
anything we need to like have it built
into our livestream platform or just
like goes crazy on them you know like
maybe I'll push a little more
interaction at least for the sub thing
I'll be really cool yeah those broken
anyways I hope not
yeah I felt it is pretty broken all of
this do you believe in the technological
singularity
that's a question for will download nice
hash epic I'm worried notification spa
don't do that I'm so he told me to smash
the bell icon and I punched my TV I see
we have to ruin a pieces like equipment
every time we ask yeah Phoenix up to 30
you 300 youtubers I'm not clicking 300
bells alright well then why are you
subbed in the first place I'll make you
I'll make you a deal you don't have to
push the bell on everybody just don't
push it on ours yeah yeah like what
really sucks is there's there's a
two-step thing right it's not a one-step
thing like it used to be like if you
want notifications you have to enable
that after the fact so a lot of people
just click the sub button and expect to
get notified when people upload videos
or they get their little toolbar on the
left that says hey we have 4 videos you
haven't seen yet by the law that's cool
but I like the old way of doing it if
you want to be 7 to 300 channels that's
on you you know liking arrow down if we
don't make the cut fine so be it will
improve but if you know you have to do
two different things to be notified
which is what a subscription actually is
when you're directly notified when
something goes live then I think that
that whole system is broken and even
then some people who click the bell icon
aren't actually being notified when
videos go live for channels so it's just
trash Will's not working for me well it
will just works with me Will's got a lot
of a lot of stuff going on he runs he
runs a lot of really cool things that
are in and out of this country
he likes uh he likes kind of tinkering
with the algos and seeing how everything
works behind this Manor so I'm really
sketchy no I don't like manipulate
anything we like we like you know we
like to see why things happened the way
they do like the fact that this video
was demonetized right away boom the
keyword killing itself there you go and
I'm sure because this videos to be
cleaned it's gonna be read to monetize I
just said that when you click the Bell
YouTube should send a USPS mail when any
of those log you that's actually not a
bad idea if you're like 10 10 days late
but how do you really want to get the
Fool's joke oh man I get email
notifications when I click the bell icon
I absolutely hate
the Bell okay so then like what is the
point of subscribing
like ireally is it just so that we show
up in your feed because YouTube does
that automatically
I mean seriously it does like if you
watch a certain channels videos over and
over and over whether or not your sub to
them or not you're gonna get their
videos in your feed that's just how the
algorithm works so there's got to be a
distinction between a subscription you
really want to watch the videos that's
what a subscription should be in my
opinion but I don't I don't know what's
going on read baby appreciate that
Scooby dooby
I appreciate your viewpoints by the way
on Bitcoin I thought he said something
about how Bitcoin mining is essentially
the same thing is printing money will
would you like I am I mean I already
know right off the bat I don't think
that's true for Bitcoin is it well yeah
I mean it's no mining for Bitcoin the
difference is there's a set amount that
we're in mind and the difficulty goes up
right there's a curve to it so it's a
controlled release of coins so it's not
at all like a normal currency there's no
government that controls it there's no
political agendas behind it
and that's that's why it's sort of you
know I'm looking at the wrong screen but
that's sort of why it's you know become
as large as it has right you know you
went from everybody talking about oh
it's gonna crash it's gonna crash people
have been telling me it's gonna crash
since 2013
you know we I've watched it crash I
think like I've watched it go from being
worth $30 a coin to being worth $2,000 a
coin and then crashing back to $12 a
coin in a matter of five minutes right
like it was very unstable in beginning
but as the network has grown and been so
diverse like it's been diversified it's
it's not really a problem so much I
think you know in losing 10% of its
value in five minutes and dropping and
people freaking out about that the
people who freaked out about that are
used to dealing with the stock market
right they're not used to dealing with
cryptocurrency so a 10% swing every day
is is not uncommon and if 10% makes or
breaks of cryptocurrency for you then
you shouldn't invest in it right I think
you you obviously if you're gonna put
money into something like this we
actually expect to lose it right I mean
this is not something you should look at
is like I mean the whole disclaimer
about I'm not a financial advisor blah
blah blah
but like don't you know don't put your
kids you know college fund into Bitcoin
right a lot of people are like taking a
loans out to get bitcoins it's just like
just cringy I don't know yeah like
you're really really playing with fire
someone said is my correct this person
someone said that we get paid when we
get subscriptions and that's not true
we might get better ads as the pea bit
better our CPM might go up if we have
more subscribers than less but we don't
get like anything for a subscription
like if you've sucked it that's zero for
us I mean it helps us we want you so
obviously but like we don't get anything
monetarily for a subscription it's it's
more or less like the subscription
drives the view right you're gonna be
more inclined to watch the video if
you're subscribed to any extent whether
you get an email or not what people
don't like the emails anymore I get
you're subscribed to 300 channels cool
it'd be a lot of emails totally get that
but you know if you want to send you're
on your left toolbar feed whatever if
you're subscribed or if you do want that
more direct notification then that in
turn will provide us very small small
percentage of the revenue but um it does
also this hat no I don't work for them
and it's not sponsored I just have it
you know like it my hair is a complete
mess so it's someone asking about that
but if you if they want to sponsor us I
tweeted at the last week na komm did
anything you knew him like yeah he yeah
I did a bunch of stuff in the server
days with this company so I just have
you know I have a hat from them some
stickers and random junk laying around
but yeah if you if you guys want to
force them to talk to us then tweet at
name.com yeah sometime written it jeez
I'm reading a bunch of these like
comments about pyramid schemes and stuff
like it's just concrete yeah I mean I
think that people people that either
hate on Bitcoin or don't understand it I
mean it is what it is right so I don't
like when people say they're there
one way about something and that's the
way it is most of them don't understand
it I think that's the net neutrality
problem most people don't understand how
the internet works
a lot of people that I respect
completely don't understand what's going
on with that issue ality right and
they're talking in an area they don't
have any expertise in so I mean you know
if you don't know about that one shut up
someone asks what the best what our
first fire we'll hit video is it was
probably the Apple video or I spent like
two K in my own cache on Apple stuff
that one that Dunn's videos are still
making us money which is pretty
surprising but Apple in and of itself is
like its own like money-making machine
so any of the channels you see out there
they're like doing Apple content chances
are they're getting tons of views just
because it's such a hot word with the
algo what motherboard for rising seven
seventeen hundred you could get by with
a be 350 board so just get a beat it's
important that you like I'm not gonna
tell you which one to get you want to be
able to earn enough Bitcoin to pay off
the medical bills I I want to be able to
earn up Bitcoin Apple tech ages slowly
crunchy for sure you guys I only heat on
virtual currency because mining has
wrecked GPU pricing crunching for sure
thank God don't I love products I think
that it's great that there is a currency
that is accepted that is not the US
currency well I mean anything really its
currency if you want to call it currency
when you trade or barter that's your
currency it's your medium of well
currencies a medium of exchange but when
you're exchanging goods you're giving a
good and inherent value all right scooby
says look I looked into what
cryptocurrency is I researched what it
is and my opinion is that it's a scam
you're convicting you're convincing
other people that lines of code you have
are worth something yeah but I you know
the reality is and something is only
worth what someone's willing to pay for
it right yeah you're not you're not
ripping anybody off by saying hey if you
want to pay this for it you can have it
and they agree to the transaction you're
not forcing anybody to buy your coin
yeah and when you when you look at
something like Bitcoin right it's it's
built by a massive amount of people
everything is transparent if you want to
look at the blockchain and see which
address now it's a not
to a degree right each address is is
traceable theoretically there's some
that aren't so traceable Bitcoin and
cryptocurrencies scared governments
because there's an you know Anonymous
factor if you look at Pablo Escobar and
his whole drug reign right he was making
a monetization I said q2 monetization
yeah yeah I mean what I've already done
one of the you know I mean so I crossed
the board made so much money that they
literally buried it right it's it's an
narcos is a great thing on a flex go
watch it yeah there they would bury the
money they like you know and when they
would ship drugs in and out of the
country and whatever they would
literally have an entire boat full of
bales of money right so that that's
something to be concerned about right
like what if not what if but when how do
you prevent criminals from being able to
use it I don't think you can but I don't
know like you they have to figure out
how can we track this on a different
level whereas you know US bank accounts
wire transfers you know the IRS and the
government can track that you know what
really is worth something food water
land in entertainment oh yeah yeah III
think though I mean I agree with will I
think that the transaction itself is
voluntary unless you're being forced to
use or extreme eeen you really kind of
force with with your country's currency
but you willingly accept that when you
live in that country it's really all you
have and it's regulated to some extent
hopefully but I think that the people
that say that cryptocurrency is just a
manipulation tool I mean it's only
manipulated the people who agree to be
manipulated by it if you know
cryptocurrency is an especially Bitcoin
I don't even know if I really see it
turning into a real currency I mean it
is now right but I think the mass
adoption might actually be on the back
end it might be something banks used it
might be you know stuff like that
because it could just be it could just
be a transmission tool almost because I
sorry says you realize when someone is
scammed it's voluntary right like no you
don't go into a transaction
like need to be scammed totally
different that's totally different than
what this is no and when you use a shady
exchange site then yeah you're taking
that risk that's the whole point like
you have to be educated about crypto
currencies yeah I mean you just have to
understand how it works and and I think
there are a lot of people who don't
understand how it works there's a lot of
people from Wall Street
I'm if you look at how much sheer cash
is in it's in Bitcoin right now there's
a huge problem because there's no way
all those people understand it there
there's a lot of people who see it as
this you know it's gonna go to the moon
or whatever and you know they're gonna
cash out at a certain number or whatever
but people who just don't understand how
it's built how it works it that scares
me for sure and I agree with you because
I don't you know I just don't know how
how they can invest in something they
don't understand it appreciate the
donation austin your boy paying for that
entertainment not that you have to we
appreciate anyway mister I can tell sark
Conde Grissom what's going on appreciate
that donation the new office looks great
really ice work Ison it's pretty cool
maybe that was that on purpose are you
gonna stay in the desks Greg yeah
eventually I'm gonna stain them up with
some kind of sealant over MDF is really
finicky so I might put something on top
of the NDF maybe like a counter top or
something like a wood wood countertop or
something along those lines I'm not sure
yet but I have like the mat like I only
use this one those right there just kind
of for show for now until we actually
get this stuff we got Coolermaster
sponsoring a bunch of the the
peripherals and whatnot but right now I
have one of these desk mats that's kind
of protecting the MDF itself from
getting wet if I have a drink on the
table or from like scratches or dents or
anything so PM says what are your
thoughts on this cord we have one if
you're in patreon we have one oh we
should probably talk about joining
Google Hangouts and that sort of thing
yeah yeah yeah so uh so if some of
you've been watching in the past we have
done Google Hangouts like I guess you
want to say like we've had guests on the
show so people that watch like all of
you in the chat right now what we've
done in the past is we've sent a link
and said hey if you want to join us in
the live stream you can
and then you use Google Hangouts to kind
of channel yourself in and that is your
way of kind of being on the live stream
you're just kind of video feeding with
both of us and you get to be on the
channel but what we've what we've done
in the past is kind of mass linked that
to everybody in the chat and it gets
pretty chaotic right because a lot of
people are clicking on we got like a
little over 300 people watching right
now so we assume 10% of you click that
and we're gonna have 30 40 people here
we can lay up 8:00 in the session total
so what we want to do to give the
patreon donors a bit of a bit of
leverage here because I think that they
don't mean they deserve it they're
paying out of pocket for for really no
reason just to support us we want to
give them an incentive so if you and we
haven't talked about really the tier
like how we're gonna do a tier why's it
really depends on how many people we
have to do this it's a lot to structure
it accordingly but we're gonna set it up
with a certain tier so for anyone who
who wants to set up an annual or monthly
donation or whatever and that tier level
then you'll have the option to join the
hangout whenever we do a live stream we
do one every Sunday so we'll try to get
as many of those people in that tier
into the live stream it's just the way
we can kind of thank you and and
personally involve you
for what you're doing for us how much
did we donate and how do we get provided
the link I would love to join the server
so this court he's asking about this
court so dis ya already you're for that
on patreon look it's like five bucks or
something like that and we're probably
gonna clear like clarify a lot of that
and try to you know make it more
detailed so you guys understand it
there's a link in the description for
patreon but what we're gonna try to do
is I guess we'll probably create your
most of you will already be in the in
the discord but we'll create a channel
or whatever you call it in discord for
the live streams and then if you guys
want if your we'll figure the tiers out
or whatever but it would probably be I
don't know like 20 bucks or something
whatever that's here is that I think we
have like I think we already have that
tier right they get like a t-shirt and
stuff like that yeah we do I don't I
don't know yet I mean it's probably
gonna be Tier three because they're
already certain number of people in that
tier so we're gonna see how many of them
are gonna be active with the live stream
but if we don't
anybody from there wanting to be live on
the channel with us then we'll drop that
tear to like the $5 tier or whatever
oh just depends Sam Wu wants a shout out
there you go shout out you're also
hating on my course there Boyd Pro
headset brah
ain't nothing wrong with course there
voids be nothing wrong with that oh and
rich so we talked to a company we're
getting t-shirts made we did pick the
design how's that been announced way the
the winner I
yeah it was it was what yeah okay so the
winner the t-shirt has been announced
we're gonna get those printed and we're
gonna see basically we'll see we'll see
how fast we can get those out for
obviously the people who are already on
patreon and then anybody else that wants
one and then yeah I'm gonna ship you
guys a will I will t-shirt just as a
joke my life goal is to walk into an
airport and see somebody wearing a shirt
with my name on it he does will things
into an airport did I would that would
be the coolest thing ever and figured
out science to do but like that would be
really cool to see somebody just wearing
like I sure this is will just will
that's it like you haven't yours nothing
about that that like would be good for
someone else to wear okay really like
it's not like a social statement there's
nothing going on there other than my
name and says I will do will things yeah
someone else's will those videos with me
will has done stuff in the background
videos he's never actually been in like
real like oh if you want to if you want
to see my video skills go to the science
in your channel and type in which one is
it that you did there's an airline video
oh oh no I'm gonna find it now I want
everyone to watch of the video yes so
it's a be climate it's Amby Amby climate
oh yeah this is so good you take
pictures on the front I think I think
this videos monetized I don't think it
is not gonna matter
so everyone click on that video and just
get yourself like a daily dose of will
all right that's what yeah it was a joke
because you know it is terrible so I
didn't plan on doing the video and then
I just got thrown into a lot of script
or anything and I got you wait a minute
you were doing that video I hadn't like
learning on the spot was like well
that's a V rally man yeah so basically
I'm terrible at videos yeah great a
video production he's done that a lot in
the past but like being on camera a
little different yeah bombing the camera
I can I love it but in front of the
camera I'm terrible i watch it they're
laughing so hard
yeah I promise you guys would send me
out something I gave some great ideas
and questions also the project suggested
last time what's going do you remember
him gaming I'll never be me um Facebook
there's like a hundred people that a
message us on Facebook that I still have
to get back to you but eventually I go
again like 90 people left the stream
when that link was posted really go
check notice to mine be 280 I realize
that but they all clicked on that you
know that's frigging rich man that is so
rich video yeah I guess we'll give it a
couple minutes for them to come back but
it was that was that was not my best
moment
McLovin towards the end of the video
yeah I did the worst part is that we
tried to go back and like reshoot some
of it because I realized that and have a
community haven't been clip and I tried
to go back and shoot some oh they want
you to link the video again yeah I tried
to I tried to go back and shoot some of
it but the problem was is it's sorry
they were closed down like we thought
they were supposed to close another day
it was a nightmare
oh well the mobile users can multitask
ads easy bro yeah we can it's okay don't
worry about it want to see it but I
don't want to miss the light that's
alright we're actually about to end the
stream it's been what about an hour and
40 minutes or so we have no like set
time on these things we just talked ill
so we get exhausted I got a video to
edit I know
Scot well things to do so that's not
it's so cool when I said that will Scott
will things to do
move your head will let them see it let
them see it
oh this he does will things oh it's
right here did you plug it no they can't
see it you didn't click it back to you
there you go
oh nevermind it's just the lane screwed
on yeah you're watching the live stream
you look at hangouts but yeah I'll put
this on t-shirts and send them out to
you guys
that's so funny everyone comes back yeah
no it's all good it was Robin yeah he
asked it a couple of times I have an
engineering degree I just don't use it
loves D McLovin part yeah no that was
like super funny we were in Tokyo just
kind of like hanging out so we were in
our little Airbnb and they're standing
on like they're literally standing on
the bed Kerry said he'd by will
Humphreys I do will things t-shirt oh my
god here guys will self promotional
thing I knew this was gonna happen
eventually goes to see you know Larry
Terry I ran into that last chat look at
that I just sold t-shirt I really think
we should like we should get your shirts
and science to do shirts made at the
same time just cuz like I think you're
sure it's would be a really funny thing
to include with the purchase victim is a
package deal but I work in a factory
where mine's way softer so they wear
mine more Wow that's that undercut
profit anyway anyway we were in Tokyo
and like Jacob and Will are standing on
this bed because there's nowhere else to
film this we got this big old bright LED
light on top of the camera
Jacob's like can't see anything and will
looks up and there's like an air of em
they said to Jacob it's perfect there's
an air fit right here this is like this
is like the thing in Tokyo you can talk
about this where mu and B climate would
really come in handy and then they went
downstairs and they film something else
and I was really impressed with how
Jacob was was keeping himself in that
video he was pretty profession well
pretty profession ya know Jacob ad-lib
that entire like his entire part was all
just like off the top of his head it was
my time to redo that his or mine it's
part you had to do years like five times
Julie or who lien who was the name who
and I forgot is when we started that's
why if you watch the video yeah I'm here
with any like comes out like the final
cut was like hey I'm here at CES 2017
but you could totally tell there's a
once as best as we could and it's a same
boolean a prettier boolean robbers like
is that read so he was saying like he
gets up there and meets this guy like
this guy's like the CEO of and you live
or whatever their company's name was so
he shakes his hand since whatever blah
blah and then they're like all right
we're gonna start filming so I think I'm
one of us oh no I was holding the GoPro
for the secondary so will looks at the
cameras like hey what's up everyone here
