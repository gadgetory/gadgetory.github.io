video today it's storming outside so if
you hear some rumbles of thunder from
the microphone I do apologize on behalf
of Mother Nature but I want to talk to
you about my logic sis RGB LED strip a
few of you have been asking me about
this so I'm going to do a full fledge
video on the actual product where you
can buy it how much it costs and the
features included with the product
itself I've owned three of these LED
strips thus far and I've been 100%
satisfied with every single one I've
owned I haven't had a single problem yet
I love the included remote the RGB
functionality even the adhesive on the
back of the strip is fairly strong I've
only had it fall only halfway once but
everything everything's great about it I
really don't have anything bad to say it
is a little bit clunky when it comes to
the wires and where you have to put
things and I will show you that here in
a sec but it does exactly what it's
intended to do and that's light of your
case very brightly I might add in
whatever color scheme you wish so let's
go and check this thing out to begin I
would like to note that this particular
LED strip is officially called the Lodge
Isis LD xrm 12c what a name but while it
may sound like a complex product it's
very user friendly included in the Box
are four large parts plus one tiny part
the molex DC connector the control box
the LED strip itself the remote and the
small addition a one millimeter
extension pin although a manual is
included in the packaging you'll likely
not need it as the assembly is rather
straightforward on one end the DC
connector plugs into any molex male
adapter from your computer's power
supply any of the four large pin cables
and on the other it runs straight into
the control box I presume it's called
that because of the infrared receiver
sprouting out from here speaking of
which you'll want to make sure this
receiver when placed inside of your case
is somewhere visible the remote signal
will not penetrate materials at all so
ensure that you can physically see it
with your own eyes or you won't be able
to use the included remote I ran my down
the side of my case between my fans and
the front panel at this point you want
to position the control box somewhere
convenient inside of your case I ran my
DC connector up from the back and above
my front fans with the control box
resting on top next in the installation
process you want to grab a hold of your
actual LED strip pay special attention
to the labels near the end
the female connector as you will want to
ensure that the power is being delivered
to the correct node you should see the
letters RG and B and also the annotation
12v this is your 12-volt power connector
so I want to simply locate the arrow on
the control box side of the connection
and align it with this 12v node on the
strip itself at this point go ahead and
connect it to simple as that
now you'll want to peel off the layer
covering the adhesive I've already done
this in my kits but the steps should be
fairly straightforward the adhesive is
durable but I don't recommend rubbing
your fingers across it as your skin oils
could reduce its adhering properties aka
you'll have to resort to packing tape
the good stuff have an idea for where
you want your strip to be in your case
because once it's adhered it should not
be moved I do not recommend removing it
and relocating it as I've done for the
sake of this video it's a sacrifice I
was willing to make for all of you good
people now onto the fun stuff the remote
this is an RGB kit so we have access to
a variety of colors I'm talking red
orange yellow green blue purple white
the entire spectrum of visible light is
practically at your fingertips on top
are a pair of brightness buttons which
are also rate changers I'll get to that
in a second and an on-off pair on the
right side are activation buttons for
flash strobe fade and smooth flash
provides a solid uninterrupted
transition between each color strobe
provides a fade in and out of white fade
much like the flash function provides a
transition between each color but are
much more steady and blended right so
it's not so abrupt
lastly the smooth function well let's be
honest it really shouldn't be here
because all it does is provide a hard
uninterrupted transition just like the
flash function but only between the
colors of red green and blue it's almost
like they ran out of programs but we're
stuck with one extra button and just
said yeah we'll call it smooth and what
does make it do that yeah but an actual
cool feature of the remote is the
brightness pairs second functions what I
call a rate changer if one of the four
ephra mention modes are active turning
the brightness up or down will dim the
LEDs or increase their brightness but
actually increase or decrease the rate
in which each of these transitions takes
place for instance increasing the strobe
effect will pulse the white light much
faster decreasing the fade effect will
provide an even more subtle transition
between each color and increasing the
flash effect will give anyone and
everyone a legitimate seizure sorry
about the sudden darkness in this room I
use natural light for most of my videos
but a
has ceased to exist only 520 the Sun
doesn't set for another hour and a half
but thanks to this storm my light has
been cut practically into thirds but
with that I want to hear from you in the
comments below about this kit if you
have a similar kit be sure to tell me if
you think that that one that you have is
a better or worse bargain than the one
that I've just showed you in this video
I really like it honestly this is my raw
impressions I don't get paid for any of
these reviews keep that in mind but I
will continue to purchase this kit for
only eighteen US dollars I have both the
Amazon and Newegg links for this kit in
the video description so be sure to
check those out give the video a thumbs
up think it deserves one give it a
thumbs down if you think it doesn't be
sure to subscribe if you haven't already
don't be shy it's okay no one's gonna
bite you this is science studio whoa get
bad outside thanks for learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
