as good as they perform I treat my
builds like forms of art and as such try
my best to keep clean
cable manage things and maintain them as
best I can
no bill that's truly perfect but it
doesn't mean that we shouldn't strive
for it and one of the ways in which I
like to make my builds pop make them
look different than the traditional PC
build is with a vertical graphics card
bracket so you've seen a few videos on
the channel dedicated to the specific
topic there are trade-offs associated
with this config in general and we'll
discuss those shortly but I want you to
know that you have a few options out
there especially now with the new cable
mod vertical bracket going back on sale
none of these solutions by the way are
perfect some are more perfect than
others though and that's why I want to
highlight this particular kit in this
video because cable mod comes pretty
darn close so you've probably seen this
kit before it went on sale for a period
of time before it was removed over
issues concerning the DisplayPort cables
included in the kit since it doesn't
require you to cut into your case in any
way special cables need to be used to
ensure proper fitment and cable mod
isn't sure that these things will work
this time around the include cables have
been rebuilt to correct any potential
issue and the new kit is now back online
so what makes this thing any different
well I stated it doesn't require any
case cutting that's probably the cable
mod kits best selling point the
competing riser from Coolermaster
requires that you remove PCIe brackets
and those little slot covers spanning
the case from the back since these
natively block rear display out on cards
so k-11 solution is to position the
bracket about an inch away from these
rear a little slot covers creating
enough space for special angled display
cables to connect to the card hence the
reason why they had to go back and
revise these and make sure they worked
out of the box the bracket is held in
place with your cases own thumb screws
and smaller ones to assemble the kit
itself are also on the box you'll also
find a riser cable included and that
makes sense obviously you can't use a
vertical kit without a riser cable
otherwise your cards just gonna sit
there and look pretty so I'm glad to see
that that's included also it doesn't
look too different from other
manufacturer designs I've seen before so
don't expect too many issues with this
particular riser cable is very well
built but this is usually where quality
control issues
rear their ugly heads so just bear in
mind that this could be a potential
bottleneck and later on down the line
the two kids I was sent you'll good
frame rates within the margin of error
using a stock direct graphics card
connection with the motherboard has a
baseline again this isn't same much lip
exam reviewer and they probably tested
these beforehand but it is something you
could test yourself to verify if your
eyes are cables in fact working properly
so if you notice your framerate on
average has dropped considerably or if
you notice in frequency during your
riser cable will likely need a
replacement that or your display cable
that's probably more of a screen issue
if your screens flickering or something
along those lines you can by the way use
any third-party PCIe riser if you're
willing to cut some corners but the
cable on version of course can be
secured directly to the included bracket
like so for a guaranteed fit so at this
point you might be thinking well this is
literally a better Coolermaster vertical
riser kit why would I buy this when the
cable market just seems better all
around there are a few cons I want to
highlight here
the first is that this kit will
literally slide your graphics card a
full inch closer to the front of your
case meaning if you're sporting
something similar in size to the fractal
design mesh fic you may have difficulty
fitting your card inside in my case an
AIO would not fit with this config and
fans barely do cards any longer than
this will not fit either so if you're
willing to go this route and make sure
your card will fit again this is about
an inch to an inch and a quarter
you can translate that it's about two
and a half to three centimeters worth of
space that you're going to lose when
using the vertical kit from cable mod so
now let's move on to installation the
kit comes in two parts what I call the
bracket and the base the bracket is a
section it slides into your PCI slot
covers you'll need a case with at least
seven PCI slots of course but this will
work with anything larger as well the
base holds of the riser cable in place
I suggest connecting these two first
then slide the base onto the bracket
from below and secure it with two of the
included thumb screws install the card
like normal threading the rear feet
through the small opening between the
bracket and the base below the graphics
card can now be secured by threading two
included screws up top make sure the
card clicks by the way into the riser
just below depending on how many
monitors you plan to use connect the
necessary number of DisplayPort and/or
HDMI cables to the card this stuff will
be more difficult to do with the bracket
fully installed in the case I'll
recommend you to do it right now you'll
see why in a second
with the card and bracket now set up and
prepare your case by removing seven
continuous screws and slot covers in
your case if your case only has seven
slots and you'll be removing all of them
just a heads up there make sure you
thread the display cables you connected
earlier through any slot frames and
connect the opposite end of the riser
cable to the motherboard that I
recommend the uppermost 16-lane PCIe
slot by the way use your cases own thumb
screws to lock the entire assembly and
you should be able to kind of straighten
things up if you notice any sag
there isn't much love this kit and
that's good and that's honestly all
there is to it so much more convenient
than cutting into cases for the same
effect cable mod does sell two separate
vertical kits by the way the only
difference being the types of display
cables included so one kit includes like
I said before two custom angled
DisplayPort cables you'll need to use
these or things similar to these because
again you're not going to fit those
cables through those rear brackets and
the other includes one custom
DisplayPort cable along with a custom
HDMI cable so you've got a bit of play
depending on your monitor setup and I
like the options here I ran some
temperature tests before and after in
this config the cable mock it places the
card slightly more forward or closer to
the left side panel then the cooler
master kit which explains the slight
temperature Delta between the two but to
be completely honest this isn't too bad
much better than any native vertical
slotting a case may include which almost
always places the card directly against
the glass or the left side panel the
result there is restricted airflow and
spiking low temperatures a small benefit
however with the card being slightly
further from the motherboard as it users
can now pair or Ram modules with larger
heat sinks with their vertical kits my
cooler master kits occasionally have
this problem especially if the cards are
dense and the modules themselves are
huge you could also fit slightly larger
a iOS and CPU coolers the air coolers
with the cable mod kit so it's a little
more compatible with respect to the rest
of your system and that's also a good
thing about this kit so there really are
a few trade-offs here slightly higher
temps with the cable mod kit for more
vertical Headroom and no cutting into
your case at the expense of limited
dimensional compatibility so remember
this bracket does push your card closer
to the front longer cards may not fit in
your current case but all-in-all I like
this bracket a lot and assuming these
riser tables hold up which it appears
like they are right now I'll be using
these things a lot more in the future I
just
I love vertical graphics card mounts I
think they look so cool so unique I've
linked cable mod kits down below along
with cool master counterparts so if
you're interested in some internal
testing in comparison you could
certainly do that I think both kits are
great and the Kula master kit is a
little cheaper but you get custom cables
included with your cable mod purchase
and you don't have to ruin your case in
the process so again there's a give and
take there but if I had to choose it be
the kaepa mod kit for now so let me know
