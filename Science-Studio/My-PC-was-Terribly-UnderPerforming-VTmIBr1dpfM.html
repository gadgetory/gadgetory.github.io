biggest pain hands-down hardware simple
because you only have a finite number of
pieces with which to tamper and remove
too and a narrow down your choices but
after you've done that you only have
software left it could only be a
software hardware issue when it comes to
PCs or maybe a networking issue but I
would still call that software so in my
cases there were two of them my CPU is
not running up to spec and my GPU sli
config and there's a two 1080s
those are just reference PCBs if you're
wondering those we're not scaling
properly so my frame rates were actually
better with a single 1080 then they were
being sli which was really confusing and
that one I still haven't completely
figured out we're going to dive into
this video what I did to diagnose first
the CPU issue and then kind of narrow
down what could have caused the graphics
cards to scale incorrectly in SLI so
let's start first with the CPU now
disclaimer upfront I don't have a script
or anything like that in front of me
this is just me expressing my concerns
and kind of trying to figure out what
exactly went wrong because a few of you
did Express similar concerns on Twitter
when I was venting over there I was
trying to get advice it's not like hey
help me I've never seen this before
so I have an idea what could have caused
these issues we'll address those in this
video first with the CPU that when I am
pretty sure I know what was wrong at
least generally speaking what was wrong
there so I noticed that my CPU was not
performing up to spec in that my
rendering times and Adobe Premiere we're
taking too long usually it's about a
minute per minute with a 1080p 60fps
file so a 5 minute video and Adobe
Premiere takes about five minutes to
export using the h.264 YouTube 1080p
preset well that was not happening
recently just floating in here recently
it's been taking 8 nine minutes for a
five-minute video file that was annoying
and it definitely caught my attention so
being the curious individual I was I
decided to open up Cinebench this is all
before I decided to make this video mind
you and run a benchmark I assume that if
the CP wasn't performing up the spec
that I would see that difference in the
score itself and sure enough my i7 6700
K clock to 4.5 gigahertz was only
achieving a score of 820 and I confirmed
multiple times that no other
major background processes were running
so what the heck was causing this and it
was by this time that I started noticing
my frame rates were nowhere near what
they should have been considering - 10
80s were packed inside of this build I
assumed partly that the CPU was to blame
it wasn't performing like an i7 shoot it
was actually more employed with like a
severely overclocked I five I guess 7600
k5 gigahertz will score close to this
score here in Cinebench so it was almost
like hyper-threading wasn't active but
hardware monitor was showing all eight
threads almost 6700 K running at 100% on
top of that I 264 confirmed that no
thermal throttling was present on the
chip period so not during a benchmark
not during idle situations the CPU
temperatures were fine core and package
I have a custom loop in here the
temperatures barely hit 70 C even with a
4.6 diggers overclock and a 1.3 7v core
I checked page filing I checked Ram I
checked everything that I could the last
thing I decided to do was hop into the
BIOS the BIOS still confirmed everything
that I thought was already good to go
the frequency was a 4.5 gigahertz the
voltage was that I think at the time 1.3
5 volts and ddr4 was running at 3200
mega it's actually under spec it was
3,600 out-of-the-box but i just-i down
clock it just in case because sometimes
those higher profiles can cause
instabilities with Windows 10 at this
point you could imagine my frustration
why was my i7 not performing like an i7
I said screw it I'm just going to
overclock the 4.8 gigahertz and boost
the V court of 1.4 see if you didn't
like that this is the skylake cpu mind
you so the seamless had me reset and
when that happens everything that you
that you've predetermined in the BIOS
all the settings are all reset back to
default as they would have been out of
the box and that fix my issue I booted
back stock into the OS ran said a bench
and look at there my score was actually
better than it was at the 4.5 gigahertz
frequency run I have no clue what's
going on you I've done this so many
times I've overclocked so many
processors with so many different
motherboards and UEFI s but resetting
the CMOS ended up fixing the issue I I
don't
that's all I that's all I have frankly I
wish I could tell you more but if you
run into an issue where your CPU doesn't
it is
feel like your CPUs performing as it
should then it's probably got something
to do with your BIOS and you should
immediately go back into that clear CMOS
and just start from scratch keep it very
simple very basic especially when it
comes to overclock
otherwise you might have a hardware
issue in which case start part swapping
that's really all I've got for you there
now on to the graphics cards this is a
science Channel I like to have as many
of the answers as possible before
filming but to this point I still cannot
explain what happened I don't know why
my framerate was so terrible as a result
of such low GPU usage that was the issue
that I kept trying to Google I asked
people on Twitter
why are my SLI 1080 s only being
utilized around 30 40 percent in games
when I build blue sky way back when
check out the video on one of these
sides here when I built blue sky I was
using the exact same 1080 sli config and
I was achieving way higher frame rates
and I was at this point so I wasn't sure
if they weren't running at 8 you know 8
lanes each or if the frequencies were
just dropping significantly maybe
thermal throttling well I check the
lanes they were both throwing it at x8
3.0 which is what you wanted with an SLI
can say at least 16 by 16 is okay as
well so the lane config was fine the
frequencies were fine the usage though
was just way too low and that's why the
frame rate was low because the cards
weren't being pushed anywhere near their
limits I confirmed the CPU usage was
where it should have been so the cpu
wasn't holding anything back my RAM
wasn't being maxed out the page filing
was still ok in the clear at this point
the only thing that I'm here to do was
completely wipe my OS that's right I
deleted everything on my computer that's
why there's not much on the desktop
anymore and reinstall the operating
system I'm currently downloading games
now to catch back up to where I was
before all of this happened and that fix
the issue check it out the framerate is
actually much higher it's but it's
actually much closer to what it was when
I built blue sky a few months ago and
now I'm a happy camper but I'm not happy
in the sense that I don't know why it
happened I I hate not being able to
explain to all of you at least in some
detail what caused the low GP of usage a
few people are just going to
automatically default to well with SLI
oh so wise
unreliable Crossfire's unreliable and
video drivers blah blah blah I don't
think the Nvidia drivers were to blame
because I use the exact same driver
after the fresh OS install and the SL I
can say is now being utilized almost at
100% in every scenario
so maybe the operating system I'm not
going to point fingers at a particular
thing but I think that there was some
setting in Windows that may have changed
without me knowing or maybe I did it
just accidentally that was severely
holding back the cards I went through
everything on Google I went through the
Nvidia control panel I made sure that
everything was sent to performance and
that I wasn't holding any of the cards
back trust me I did everything that you
guys suggested on Twitter and more and
nothing until the fresh OS install gave
me any result at all I even have a
g-sync monitor hooked up and I assume
that that was causing it if you google
GPU usage low 1080s sli the first thing
that comes up is a G sync issue where
for some reason the SLI can say doesn't
work well with G sync and of pushing far
fewer frames than they should and that's
why the cards don't work very hard but
turn that off did nothing for me it
actually made things slightly worse on
screen visually so that's kind of where
I have to end the video now if you are
in doubt I know it sucks I hate
recommending fresh OS install because it
takes a lot of time and you have to
backup a ton of files and if you don't
do that then you're be sitting around
for days reinstalling all of the
programs that you previously had on your
operating system but that cured my
cancer and I think that I'm going to be
very careful about where I go where I
click any operating system any Nvidia
control panel from now on just don't do
anything that you that you aren't
familiar with don't click on something
that you are not sure what it does and
don't change settings that aren't
in-game if you change things outside of
game settings then it's going to affect
your entire system it will affect every
game that you play from there on out
just a few words of wisdom take them
from someone who basically trialed and
errored for the past three days I am
proud to say though that whatever I did
by installing the operating system all
over again
fix the graphics card equalization issue
again the BIOS seamless reset
fix the CPU and it's just as dirty
overclock I guess is what that was but
it fixed it those are last resorts but
they're surefire ways to fix software
issues if that doesn't fix whatever
you're trying to
six then you might have a serious
hardware issue one that you can't fix
yourself with that give this video a
thumbs up if you thought it was cool to
dislike if you just hate everything
about life or you just dislike the video
because think I don't know what I'm
doing whatever click a subscribe but if
you haven't already and I will catch you
in the next video another car video
coming up this is science studio thanks
