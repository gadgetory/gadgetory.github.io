studio we've completed our first intel
skylake build this one featuring the
Intel Core i3 6100 and if you didn't get
a chance to watch our holiday budget
build videos last week we'll review all
the parts we purchased in this video at
the core of our build is of course the
Intel i3 6100 a part of the new skylake
lineup now it's packing two cores and
four threads thanks to hyper threading
but it holds its own in games and will
prove that shortly
so our asrock pro 4 z170 motherboard
came in and it looked even better in
person to be honest first things first
let's go ahead and unhinge the locking
mechanism protecting the CPU pins make a
note of the white arrow on the board and
match it up to the golden arrow on the
CPU itself gently place the CPU into
place with both arrows pointing in the
same direction and then riehen to the
socket lock the plastic cover on top
should just pop right off at this point
we purchased another cooler master hyper
t44 this rig for the simple reason that
we loved it so much on our earlier
scorpion build no really that that's
actually why we purchased it it cooled
our FX 6300 so well that we decided to
kind of implement it into our I 3 build
here and of course while our CPU cannot
be manually overclocked it will keep it
nice and cool during CPU intensive tasks
and games it's also much better than the
stock Intel cooler to be quite frank so
follow the instructions that came with
the cooler corresponding to the LGA
socket 1151 motherboard layout which is
the layout of the Azeroth board that we
have here make sure that nothing is too
tight or too loose things should screw
on nice and snug but don't force
anything grab a hold of some thermal
glue in our case Arctic silver 5
high-density silver paste and dab a
pea-sized amount on top of the CPU place
the cooler on next being sure to use the
hinge that came with the accessory there
should be a nice firm snap into place
when rotating that black lever so at
this point your CPU should be completely
installed our 26 66 megahertz of ddr4
all nice and blingy is being installed
next now for a dual channel array with
these pan Ram dims place them in either
slots 1 &amp;amp; 3 or 2 &amp;amp; 4 because the cooler
in this case is being mounted vertically
we don't have any issue with Ram height
like we did in our last build so you can
actually afford to purchase dims with
more ostentatious heat sinks if that
pleases you
snappy i/o shield that came with your
motherboard into place at the back of
your Tower and prepped you're assembled
motherboard or the merge the march to
Marge we have cables hanging all over
the place in our case because we reuse
an old NZXT s340 tower but the power
supply and cable management phases of
the building process typically come
right after this step rather than right
before it once you do have your
motherboard situated and screwed into
place install the following items your
power supply of course your hard drives
and or solid-state drives as well as any
case fans you may have laying around oh
and don't forget your graphics card
while our Intel i3 does house onboard
graphics a separate graphics card is
always recommended but not most
importantly here be sure that everything
is wired correctly if you think you may
have a faulty part be sure that you've
wired it correctly first to verify that
it is actually faulty and that it's not
just the fact that it's not plugged into
your power supply or motherboard or both
so when assembling is complete give that
power button a push and cross your
fingers if you see lights you've wired
some things correctly but if you see a
post that is a screen notification that
the BIOS is loading then you've likely
wired everything correctly but you can
verify this in the BIOS itself as long
as everything is installed and it's
being detected you're likely in the
clear so not only do we have the cooler
master hyper t4 here but underneath that
obviously is the Intel Core i3 6100 like
I said clocked at 3.7 gigahertz I
believe it turbos to like 4.0 maybe 4.1
don't quote me on that but it does turbo
above its stock frequency so that's
something to take note of as well the
motherboard is in asrock LGA 1151 pro 4
board
it's a z170 board so it has the ability
to overclock a CPU if that CPU is
overclockable
in this case obviously it's not but a
simple swap with an Intel i5 6600 K or
6700 k i7 would would you know why you'd
overclock so that's cool so there's some
upgrade ability in this system you know
I don't have to go buy a whole new
motherboard if you want to overclock CPU
so that's quite nice the CPU is pretty
cheap compared to the competitors I
didn't have any problem just installing
it right away
installing Windows after that I've read
a few comments about how you you know
should update your BIOS right away or
your system will start crashing after a
while I haven't updated the BIOS because
I don't like updating BIOS as it just
it's not it's never worked out for me so
I'm gonna go as long as I can without
updating BIOS just for the sake of
stability at this point in time so let's
jump on over to the benchmarks for this
system we use two Geekbench 3 first to
benchmark our CPUs performance you can
see our system hooked up to our right
and right away we were impressed with
what we saw now for just a two core four
thread processor we yielded a single
core 32-bit score of three thousand
eight hundred and eighty six which is
actually the third highest of any CPU
score on geek benches website that's
super impressive for a 120 dollar
processor we had to scroll down quite a
bit actually to find AMD's FX series
processors on the list
the 8350 single core score whose
architecture is very similar to that of
the FX 6300 from our scorpion build was
much lower than our 38 86 score so not
bad for our little i3 Heaven benchmark
was up next to test the GPU side of
things and at Ultra settings and MSAA at
times two-wheel did an average FPS rate
of 31.3 also not bad at all for our
little r7 370 which only cost us about
$160
we perform some real-world installing to
test the power of our SanDisk SSD the
specs of which are posted on our $600
skylight
build video and we were very impressed
with how snappy everything loaded and
installed wow that was quick GTA was up
next which acted as a blend between CPU
and GPU performance since GTA is notably
a very CPU intensive game and we were
very impressed with how it ran
everything was set to very high and msaa
was off however we had long-distance
scaling maxed out and even turned on the
high definition while flying option keep
in mind this is being run with a
dual-core hyper threaded processor eight
gigabytes of 26 66 megahertz ddr4 and a
4 gigabyte asus strix r7 370 the total
price tag of which comes out to just
over $300 that's insane performance for
the price our Cinebench score was okay
the only depressing one of the bunch we
only obtained a score of 381 which is
actually a little under half of what
you'd get from a Haswell i7 but when you
consider the fact that the i3 only has
two physical cores it lightens the mood
a bit after all we're not purchasing
this processor for heavy video rendering
or anything of that sort so all in all
when you consider what exactly you're
getting performance wise for your dollar
this intel skylake III is a solid choice
games will run a super smooth when
paired with any modern and efficient
graphics card probably $150 and over and
will also be aided by the ultra-fast and
resourceful nature of ddr4
that comes along with it if you're a
gta5 junkie like I am then this set up
is for you expect to play almost any
game you'd like with this set up at
1080p with a stellar FPS rate you can
take that to the bank
thanks so much for building along with
us stay tuned for future videos for sure
give us a like if you thought we were
great
give us a dislike if you thought we were
terrible and please leave feedback or

those are always welcome and
speaking of always as always this is
