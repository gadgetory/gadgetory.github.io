often you know that I love the NZXT s340
I've featured many builds in this case I
love its aesthetic appeal its open
design the entire case is just beautiful
in my opinion so when I see cases online
that look to an extent like the s340 I
tend to want to purchase those and
compare them to it just to kind of see
how well it stacks up against what I
regard as one of the best cases
currently on the market so when I saw
the fantex p400 selling on Amazon for
$79.99 the white one I might add
with the nice side window as well I said
oh they are gunning for the s340 let's
see how well the p400 stacks up what
kind of features you two expect to see
in this case some of the cool things
that the s340 doesn't have this one does
have I don't know you tell me in the
comments below which one you think is
better check out the p400 first let me
know what you think the p400 who stands
definitely rivals that of the s340 is
great plain and simple the white is
glossy the frame is sturdy and the
interior is very clean starting from the
front we find a removable panel equipped
with nothing but filters nice giving way
to a large fan and radiator mounting
bracket it'll fit a 280 millimeter
radiator nice and snug under the top
cover are two buttons a reset switch and
an LED adjuster clicking this button
will allow you to cycle through several
colors across the spectrum and will
change both the power LED and under glow
hues the reset button well you know what
that does the top has support for 2 140
millimeter fans or their radiator
counterparts and also comes with a large
magnetic dust filter just to the south
are two USB 3.0 headers a microphone
jack and one for headphones the RGB
power button is centered on top towards
the front and provides a sturdy click
when powering on the back is fitted with
standard s340 stuff a rear i/o slot
support for only a 120 millimeter fan or
rad combo seven PCIe slots and added
metal shroud which is nice the s340
didn't have that at least the normal one
the razor one did and of course the
power supply opening I only wish this
panel was painted white as well that
would have been the icing on the cake in
terms of aesthetics for me the large
window on the side of the P 400 is just
slightly tinted
revealing to all of your internal
goodies not to worry it scratches very
very easily though so be mindful of this
as well removing the front panel we find
one coherent open space to the right
you'll find four plastic caps that can
be removed to fit hard drive cages which
must be purchased after the fact I have
no interest in covering up my radiator
space so I'll simply paint these plastic
caps white voila there you go now they
match the rest of my setup just to the
west of these are two large rubber
grommet slots for routing cables above
the top motherboard tray are an
additional two slots for fan cables and
your CPU power cables / whatever else
you want to stow up there and then just
atop the basement shroud we find another
three openings for the front i/o USB HD
audio/video power cables the works the
only let down here is the fact that the
basement shroud does not offer a
dedicated PCIe cable route I had to run
my cables through one of the bottom
three openings underneath the
motherboard instead small open circles
litter the top and can be seen through
the case the opposite side of the case
was actually a very pleasant surprise to
tool as harddrive trays come equipped
with the p400 as well as two solid state
drive trays which mount on the back
panel behind the motherboard in terms of
cable management fantex provides three
velcro straps to secure any and
practically all cables run down the side
of the case I should also note that even
with the non modular power supply I had
plenty of room to store all of my unused
cable branches especially with the
bottom hard drive tray completely
removed all together I wasn't really
using it so all-in-all I give the
building experience in the P 409 point
five out of ten I can't fault it for not
being a full tower because while I knew
what I was purchasing my purchased it so
I think that the P 400 actually makes
the most of what it has in terms of
space availability and cable management
now in the case of aesthetics it's
entirely subjective so you might not
agree with what I'm about to say next
but bear with me this is my personal
opinion about how I feel about the case
and its looks apart from the fact that
the back panel is not painted white like
the rest of the case I'd say everything
else is literally perfect I wouldn't
change anything else about how this case
looks about it stands all that to me is
is literally perfect if you don't agree
with either of my scores in this case be
sure to let me know in the comments down
below and we can Duke it out folks I'm
not going to lie this is my new favorite
case and I think from now on if I want
to build an amid
our I will choose the P 400 until
something even better comes along which
I find hard to believe but it's
certainly possible so that's my verdict
I think that this thing should
definitely be considered me to get the
LEDs in there get that nice open design
just like the s340
you have the nice basement panel
covering up the power supply plenty of
space for all of your cables even if
you're not using a modular power supply
it's it's it's the works guys it's
everything you want in a computer case
and at a sweet price point that's very
competitive against the s340 so with
that I'll leave it up to you let me know
in the comments which one you like more
based on what you've seen so far I know
I haven't done a review on the s3 40 but
I've built plenty of pcs in them so you
at least know what they look like from
the outside be sure to give the video a
thumbs up if you think it deserves one
give it a thumbs down if you think it
doesn't heck just give it a thumbs up if
you if you like the case let me know if
you like the case that much and we'll be
sure to pass on the good news to fantex
if that is the case be sure to click
that subscribe button if you haven't
already don't be shy folks this is
