channel little almost a year ago man
came long way didn't expect to be you
know this popular it's a it's a surprise
to me and you so you know a lot of
people judge me and you know college was
difficult you know going through school
and having a channel it's not something
that everyone does but you know what the
parents behind you and all of these
great commentators and everyone that is
you know subscribe died I really do
appreciate it you're not helping me but
you're helping the whole family danimals
pretty gay so I would personally like to
thank YouTube and Google for sending me
such a tremendous plaque you know I
think they appreciate how much efforts
gone into this trip and you know this
one year has been a lot but I hope to
make more of it well without further ado
I would like to unbox what YouTube has
presented us it's a big moment the big
moment Oh ladies and gentlemen would you
look at that we are looking at a 100,000
subscriber plaque / plaque it's looking
fantastic ya gotta zoom in on that Greg
well as you can tell the chrome really
outlines the YouTube button pretty well
the black just brings out the white
inside and the gray I mean it all mixes
pretty well if you look very closely you
can see the distinct smile of me looking
at it see you see me smiling see that
you know this goes out to my grandfather
he wasn't very good at computers at all
but you know I think he's looking down
on me right now and he's saying Jacob
you did it 100,000 subscribers probably
still doesn't know what that means but
you know I got a plaque for it so that's
all that matters well I want to thank
everyone you know for being a good sport
in the comments section and you know
leaving positive and sometimes not so
positive comments about AKA savage
studio with your host Sal's our studio
what is that I'm going by yeah yeah I
want to apologize to Miguel I didn't
know what Chinchorro was part of your
family tradition of every Christmas
that's what you would eat for dinner you
know being raised as a German we have
sausage but you know i'm not going to
dal you for your chat sure because
sausages are pretty much the same thing
on Christmas Eve big shout-out to msi ok
NZXT the AMD big shout-out to y'all

deepcool genome that's not part of NZXT
ok um what's that one computer monitor
they never sent me oh yeah it's French
for something Oh Mexico what is it oh
pixee Oh big shout-out sponsor to pick
CEO I would also like to thank all of
the fans that have been so supportive
leaving great commentary and everything
you know being one-on-one with me with
their builds tech porn Tuesday baby
rated number one on Twitter it's pretty
big but you know the rest of the
sponsors that I can't name off the top
of my head but a big shout-out you know
the fans the support without you guys
you know this channel wouldn't be
anything I would still be at 2,000
subscribers with videos that are pretty
much taken off of my phone as I
awkwardly sit my room with my frizzy
hair and my facial beard coming undone
well I look forward to advancing
throughout the next couple of years and
see where this channel goes I know with
college and with other life events
happening you know this channel has been
part of my life and I want to continue
growing with you guys the sponsors
wherever it takes me I know this channel
for some people is sort of like a home
base where they can come back and
I'll chat with other people that like to
build computers and i hope to progress
with each and every one of you all and
bring you better and gooder damn it i
hope to bring you a better content as we
progress and as you can probably tell in
some of my earlier videos they were not
as a good of quality as they are now and
i hope to ya then i hope to bring you
better quality and the upcoming shoots

come and I look forward to having the
pleasure of making videos for your
entertainment and to teach and I look I
look forward to it until then thank you

shining on your face your eyes are like
so recessed into your skull are they

know for some they call me savage studio
because i tend to light them up on the
comments section but you know once a
troll all ways to troll why the hell

people to think especially you know my
mom man you know those long nights where
she would stay up and you know make me
