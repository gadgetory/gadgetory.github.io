have been warned
this man jumped into a few inches of
lava it's something that isn't well
documented a lot of speculation goes
into figuring out what exactly would
happen if a human jumped into molten
rock I like to say up front that this is
an area of special interest to me I have
a minor in geology and studied
geophysical phenomenon on a daily basis
that being said what you're about to
hear is speculation the data from which
these conclusions will be derived are
facts that we have virtually no hands-on
proof of what exactly would happen what
would happen if this dude did this in
real life let's break down the scene for
context this movie is called volcano and
stars Tommy Lee Jones and Anne Heche a
future under Los Angeles after a series
of earthquakes results in a small
volcanic eruption almost completely
magmatic very little pyroclastic
material reaches the surface composition
suggests that the lava itself is
extremely Masek reliant on heavy
elements namely iron and magnesium these
elements have high melting points but
yield relatively non viscous flows like
these here in contrast siliceous lava
also known as felsic lava is high in
compounds such as silicon dioxide and
has a much higher viscosity fun fact the
two most common elements in the Earth's
crust are oxygen and silicon so look
under rocks that kind of makes sense
typically not as hot either as a general
rule of thumb the hotter the liquid is
the faster it will flow so this lava is
without a doubt very Masek and very hot
the last nations around 1,000 degrees
Celsius that's about 1700 degrees
Fahrenheit the lava and the scene is
also traveling down a subway tunnel
which traps and recycles a good deal of
the heat this character here played by
John Carroll Lynch has to make his way
through a subway car while 1000 degree
lava moves one foot underneath the metal
floorboard this is an inaccuracy in
itself the air in the car would
certainly boil his lungs and like we
said his clothes on fire cotton will
solve ignite around 400 degrees I'll be
speaking in terms of Celsius from now on
by the way here the rubber in his shoes
would almost immediately liquefy be
Falken ization isn't the only process
that would be taking place a geologist
on OSU's website reported that radiant
heat from a lava that's very cool
siliceous lava to be felt from his
helicopter some four hundred meters
above the flow needless to say
the entire scene you're about to see
would be impossible to plan in real life
the subway tunnel would be baking
several hundred degrees above maximum
oven temperatures thanks to its
insulating properties so John Carroll
Lynch's character miraculously makes it
to the edge of the train car carrying
this 300-pound dude it's Manny from
George Lopez by the way and faces a new
hurdle I mean literally this dude's got
to jump some eight or so feet if you ask
me the guy his carryings already dead
toss him in and use him as a stepping
stone but no of course this character is
a hero and as LA's Metropolitan
Transportation chair feels responsible
for allowing the subway to run in the
first place
he takes a grand leap and makes it about
half way the first thing you'll notice
about is a jump is it as close
immediately catch fire if we assume the
train car wasn't an oven in the first
place then this here is accurate
temperatures some 10 feet above lava can
still simmer at or near the melting
points of some heavy metals if this guy
simply inhales his lungs will collapse
and liquefy now here comes the weird
part physical properties of lava
apart from heat remember this is rock
we're talking about and even with this
relatively low viscosity at play it's
still much denser than water and
incredibly viscous by comparison
stepping into it in this case about a
foot deep would feel a bit like stepping
into wet concrete in terms of
consistency you'll be able to walk
around in it temperature aside but you'd
have very heavy feet and you feel as
strained as you would walking in thick
sand with temperature considered however
consistency wouldn't matter you would
have much time to notice it your skin
would char and melt for sure but would
last long enough to keep you from
exploding on account of the water
composition inside of you this video
here has been played time and time again
to detect what would happen if a human
jumped into a pool of lava and this is
accurate but not much has been detailed
in regard to jumping into a shallow flow
of it there are actually accounts of
geologists in Hawaii falling into
shallow flows of lava and being able to
escape so that's just it they of course
had severe burns but they were able to
escape they were able to lift themselves
out of the lava they didn't instantly
explode on account of all the water
inside of them our skin while relatively
permeable is an incredible shield in
many aspects
on a sidenote see this video here for a
detailed description what would happen
if a human was suddenly exposed to outer
space the last part of this description
then should focus
the slow melting of John Carroll Lynch's
character this would not happen first
off he'd most certainly fall over let's
be real
the natural tendency of a human and pain
is to curl over so he'd probably fall
face-first killing him instantly
but even if we assume he manages to stay
upright the next thing that kill him is
toxic gas specifically carbon dioxide
sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide co2
will kill you slowly so2 will kill you
faster and h2s will kill you immediately
this one's actually a huge concern in my
field petroleum engineering if we assume
that the gases don't kill him then the
Surefire cause would clearly be Fiat
melting nope just kidding' movie depicts
him dying here when the lava reaches his
heart when in reality all of the water
in his body would have already
evaporated I'm not entirely sure which
would have happened first but I do
believe the water in his body would
evaporate faster than the skin and
muscle tissue wrapping his bone even
though these admittedly are also filled
with water so yes he would have died via
dehydration that's rapid boiling of
water inside of him and showed up like a
raisin before his solids had time to
melt believe it or not that is some
strange science if you like this video
