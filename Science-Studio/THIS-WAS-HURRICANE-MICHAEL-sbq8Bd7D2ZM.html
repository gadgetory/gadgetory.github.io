actually my parents place I lived here
for 15 years
and it's good you're gonna be a total
loss and it's it's leaked everywhere
poor fish in the pond there's no
circulation or anything
the garage is trashed the wind tried to
blow the garage door out cars or well
they're on okay shape but the whole
neighborhood is gone this whole city's
doesn't look the same with no trees up
anymore just it looks like it's a farm
you see his roof snapped off people
bringing in construction equipment
bulldozers even smaller things chainsaw
us to get some of the branches and
Trunks out of the roads I'm not even
sure how I was able to make it here from
the beach in my car the major highways
are still partially blocked if we can go
around back here by the way guys I'm
recording this on my phone this isn't
gonna be I'm not gonna monetize this
video or anything like that no ads
nothing I'm not I'm not into to me
that's just messed up this is a just
being film to show you guys what it's
like to go through one of these or to
have something important to you like a
house and go through a storm that's
powerful this used to be my parents
backyard pool pump fence is completely
blown out neighbor's pool doesn't even
look like a pool neither does ours it
doesn't look like the same house at all
my kitchens done for for sure
no shingles nothing up there and you see
some some roofs did better than others
some trees did better than others
it's where my dad shed used to be it's
completely gone his mower still there
it's kind of funny look there's not much
light to make it the situation but it's
it's oh we got left at this point no
one's hurt that's that's the important
thing the only thing that matters I'm
not sure what they're gonna do after
this I feel guilty because my place was
impractically unscathed
compared to this it was basically
untouched 10-15 miles further west of an
impact and this would have been my place
so just an update on what's going on
here again this isn't monetize this
isn't I'm not publishing this for any
sort of notoriety especially for the
wrong reasons just just documenting what
went on here it's really bad so keep us
in your thoughts prayers
and it isn't pretty mrs. hurricane
