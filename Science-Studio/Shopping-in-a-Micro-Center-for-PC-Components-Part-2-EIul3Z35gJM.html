be not a lot of filming today and he's
got his phone with a timer why were we
walking is to start timing it how could

sliding around 30 to 35 I don't know if
the other Micra center with this
microcytic know about us but we did post
the other video this morning so I don't
know we'll see let's go inside to find
out ok so right away I'm getting the
impression this one is much nicer looks
like they have a lot more to look at
here so check out just the cases first
off okay we have like a whole section of
the store dedicated to just computer
cases Wow impressive
Oh God mmm shoutout to parth see if you
can find your $5 hose at 5 or $9 power
supply $10 $10 that's probably a good
thing I think would catch on fire within
the first like 10 seconds of use give us
some solid state drives those are good
competitive prices for 240 gigs over
here to a Oh God
oh yeah 789 but you're paying for I
talked about as a high speed essentially
solid thing first on the lookout for us
shoutout look at our security guard for
the evening
oh do you remember the G 210 from
several videos ago you can pick one up
here at your local Micro Center for $20
you're gonna tell me stop oh whoops why
is that good for a gtx 960 $279 yeah
that's that's not a good Oh in that was
mistake
oh here's Ram look at this I'm catching
on say oh you know exactly what you're
looking at good job so we have a much
wider selection of AMD products at this
particular micro Center FX 6300 for 89
bucks look at that you get an 8 core
8320 e for the same price that is a WoW
that's actually a really good deal
that's a really good B that's a great
deal Greg it is a tough off if you know
computers you know that to give you oh I
know computers if you've looked at the
previous video you can tell by the shirt
I wore three hundred and ten dollars for
a core i7 6700 K hit yourself - good old
G 32:58 a lovely anniversary edition
overclockable pentium dual-core
processor for 50 bucks all this is a
six-shot oh it's like a 360 view look at
this
so stop eating like oh my goodness I'm
feeling up you feel this uh look at this
like oh look at that play-by-play
swinging back okay if we upgraded my PC
Greg talk dirty to me give me prices you
bag of loot and perform it I'm telling
him if you want sup criticism right now
that's it and that's an excellent price
on a 325 in that box
Oh mr. cheap you okay if we get that
parrot even with like a nine seven we'll
need a 980 of X if we just get like a
970 motherboard overclock that modestly
huge performance increase in your system
or five I can play video games like semi
good with that you'll definitely be able
to with yours hmm
blow baby blow out yeah so we're just
trying to make there it is the doctor
Thunder dr. Tunde
he 170 X a gaming 5 motherboard repaired
and tested so this one was actually a
faulty motherboard 120 bucks we're
getting a slight discount overall well I
mean it's a top seller my little man for
that price of the find out if you see
this top seller play that top seller
baby it turns out for one up for one
oh we said that when you're laying it up
a fun you better win theta though
jarmons Littlejohn what I left hold on I
think so Oh Jacobs well I think I could
get you like punch off on that to it oh
really yeah swag Oh shake it you could
just get just a bare-bones 970 like this
50 bucks here well is it ourself alone
$15 million rebate so we have to mail 16
to 64 well after spending would it be
$30 off of that to the gigabyte one
that's why it sets a pretty neutral
color course I feel actually yeah there

that one's black you can see ours will
paint those line this is my first PC I'm
an Xbox one player sponsored by Cheetos
looks like a really cheap pcs form it's
not up to pay you can talk about the
club in the Panhandle
yeah you feel like you got to shake you
feel with it let's see the hyper 212 Evo
how much are they sell on the floor I
think the other store was selling for 26
bucks
I'm not seeing the price oh here we go
yeah 26 bucks okay so that's cool so the
prices are pretty much the same
throughout these stores and then this
means $18 again very good price on a
high protein for I've always wanted to
try out these almond coolers I've heard
good and bad things about them I've
always wanted to at least try one they
look unique if I use an unlock code on
the keyboard will you give us a discount
food frenzy ten tasty games for seven
dollars you get all that poor I'm
getting all of it this is the blue
snowball it's similar to my blue Yeti
that I use I have videos covering this
particular unit by the way you can check
that out right somewhere around there
probably not going to it correctly am i
pointing to a quickly parth look more
this way really banger I thank you you
have this looks like a 100 i water pours
it right in there
and itself with another 110 bucks that
is not far off at all from what you
would be paying retail price according
to micro Center so wow I'm impressed
Micro Center says well you can build it
for about this price that will charge
you roughly 50 bucks
over the parts price that's actually
that's admirable I'm impressed with that
much better than Best Buy and presumably
much better than Walmart - so you have a
microphone or name you don't want to
build your piece of yourself consider
Micro Center for sure there's a guy
everyone who's been looking at this the
whole time the white yeah I noticed
did he walk his way but look at this
