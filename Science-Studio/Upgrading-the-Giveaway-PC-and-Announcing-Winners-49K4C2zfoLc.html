this video and I've got about two days
of work ahead of me just involving
shipping winners their giveaway items
and yeah it's just gonna hurt my wallet
this kind of be pretty expensive but
nonetheless it's part of the gig and you
guys are awesome that's why I want to do
this I know that some youtubers don't
want to do giveaways very much because
people aren't appreciative or don't say
thank you I don't care like it would it
would help it'd be nice if you said
thank you but I'm not giving you
something expecting you to say thank you
I'm giving you something because I
appreciate something you are already
doing for me as in being a viewer being
a subscriber being a follower on social
media so this is a payment to you this
is me saying thank you to you not you
saying thank you to me I think that's a
little backwards and some people said
anyway yeah we're gonna get to the to
the meat potatoes this one right now
if you're rocking the Windows 10
operating system and haven't activated
your copy click the link below and
purchase an OEM license from s CD key
then click here here here and then here
paste your activation key and you'll
have a fully activated OS in seconds and
be sure to use my offer code as studio
for an 18 percent discount on your order
so last night was awesome I'm still a
little exhausted from that one I didn't
expect it to be as big as it was we had
up to 2400 concurrent viewers at peak
which is the most we've ever had for a
live stream on the channel I appreciate
all of you for stopping by and look I
know a large part of that had to do with
the fact we were giving away like 18
things but it was the biggest giveaway
we've ever done and that was due in
large part to a new egg and their
agreement to send us $2,000 worth of
basically gift cards to giveaway so what
I'm gonna do for those who live in the
u.s. is I'm going to ship from my own
new egg account us winners they're
products that they won on the stream and
then if you live in another country
where new egg services you maybe it's
like the UK or France or Germany and
there are several countries elsewhere as
well not just Europe and in North
America as long as your country is
listed in that link that I posted up top
and that video description click the
video here if you're interested in any
of that stuff then you're still eligible
to win I haven't confirmed yet that
everyone is in those countries there's
like 18 winners again but once I get
your addresses I will follow up and make
sure that everyone is good to go if
someone is not in a country where they
can be shipped something then we'll
redraw that winner but anyway you should
have gotten emails if you won you should
have gotten one from me already again I
know your email because you had to enter
it when you enter the raffle so that's
the first bit of business I wanted to
cover second of all we've got to do a
bit of upgrading for our giveaway PC the
gigabyte and enter Mac sponsored a PC
that we built in this video right here
is getting a small upgrade I really
shouldn't say small because it's gonna
make this PC look miles better in my
opinion we're gonna throw some custom
cables from cable mod in there these are
just extensions now you could get full
sleeve kits for compatible PS use but I
decided to that Carly laughs I decided
to get these here because these will be
compatible with really any unit
and yeah so they're gonna be cheaper
that's an upside these are the pro
sleeve cables it looks like they have
the the metal combs here and they're
just they're really nice I use cable mod
custom cables custom Pro cables in
particular for pretty much all of my
personal builds and just make they just
make your system look so much better so
if you have some cash to spare I have
linked the kala mod configurator down
below you can create a custom sleeve kit
for yourself for your own power supply
you can get extensions or full sleeve
kits that plug directly into your unit
either way it's worth a look at least if
you again have a bit more money in your
budget for aesthetics nothing of course
increase your frame rate or anything but
it's gonna make your system look a lot
better so yeah let's get to it let's
throw these in the giveaway system and
then we'll go ahead and draw the winners
for the free giveaways that we announced
in that video I pointed to earlier right
so we have a gigabyte and enter max
sponsored PC giveaway and then we also
have the two graphics cards a 90 DTI and
the 1080 both of those are boxed up
already in my cards got to put little
tracking labels on them for whoever
happens to win and I will draw those
winners in this video so you'll get to
see live who is pick when I live but you
know I mean I'll film
whoever wins as it's happening and then
you can see it and if anyone is
published anyway that way you know I'm
not like cherry-picking obviously the
two graphics code of winners will be
international meaning they will not be
in the lower 48 US if you live in Hawaii
or Alaska you're considered
international so you have two chances to
win and then the u.s. winner will win
the big PC all right I'm gonna stop
repeating myself here we go let's throw
these into our giveaway system so this
was my thinking choosing a black and
white alternating cable set first off
this is like a pre-designed scheme here
so you can find this exact like color
scheme we're just alternates black and
white on cable mods website usually get
these shipped a little quicker as well
because they are already kind of like
pre set up this way but I think that
this color scheme will complement the
build nicely you can see there's quite a
bit of white in the system including the
case which is almost totally white and
then we also do have some black
components like the motherboard like the
you know USB 3 cable the vertical GPU
bracket we've got there so there's still
some black in the system and I think
this will set everything off and help it
all blend nicely so that's my
justification
I don't expect everyone's gonna be
totally satisfied with that but you
can't please everybody on the internet
so now anyway felt like I had to say
that I have to justify my decision and
that's totally fine so we're gonna
remove this and start swapping them
cables so really for extensions the
shorter the extensions the better as
long as you have enough of the cabling
to reach the destination without some of
the PSU cabling showing and that it
should be fine probably could have gone
with a shorter extension here but I
wanted to be more on the safe side and
there we go so that's the 24 pin already
looking significantly better in my
opinion now as for the graphics card
it's gonna be a bit tougher to hash this
one out cuz we do have that USB pre
cable right in the way same deal just it
around connect it like so try to get
these combs to line up so that that's
the best I could do of course you want
to get this propped up when we tie
everything to the back it should
straighten up nicely but that's kind of
what its gonna look like and this is
just a consequence of going with a
vertical bracket but I totally I mean to
me this is a very mild compromise for a
system that has this card turned
sideways in it just gonna look really
nice so yeah one more set of cables
that's for the 8 pin EPS up top now one
thing I totally forgot it's my fault no
one else's I forgot that this
motherboard has an 8 pin plus an extra 4
pin for CPU power and that's really only
necessary when you're doing some heavy
overclocking but like I'm using my not
100k in my personal rig with just a
single 8 pin that board actually has 2 8
pins on it and I only connected one of
the 8 pins and I still get similar boost
frequencies with MCE enabled so you're
not gonna miss much in the way
performing it's gonna look a little
weird if you have this exposed but you
can't even really tell that there's an
extra 4 pin here you can connect the 4
pin I still have that cable it's just
the black stop cable in the system but
I'm gonna leave it disconnected for now
just so doesn't look super tacky you can
do whatever you want if you win
all right so that's it and give a couple
shots from far back here you can see how
nice it looks I really think these
cables are just the icing on the cake
for this rig and now we're going to give
it away and alright now it's time to
pick the winners and you guys have been
waiting for this part of the video I
understand we have about thirty 2127
entries there were a few ways to enter
including following me on Twitter and
also following animatics and gigabyte I
believe and also YouTube subscriptions
like it's something else out of it and
now we're gonna pick the winner so the
way we do that is with this winners time
here and we have draw winners so I just
click this button and it will pick a
winner for us and I'm gonna show you on
the camera and on screen so you know
that I'm not messing around here or
redrawing or anything like that limit
entries by day doesn't matter winners to
draw we're just drawing one winner one
winner one winners unpicked with ten
thousand fifty potential users that can
win here we go
and the winner is Tom Schuster just
Chester Tom Chester I have no idea if
that's how you say your last name I
apologize but you are a resident of
Laurens New Jersey I'm gonna blur out
your email and your other info your
picture and stuff Tom so that your
identity is somewhat concealed here and
you won for following gigabyte USA on
Twitter so congratulations you just won
yourself it I mean this is over a
thousand dollars worth of PC hardware
here and it's gonna be all assembled for
you ready to go you can do whatever you
want with it I don't care you can sell
it you can use it yourself give it to a
friend doesn't matter to me
fact is you won by doing something here
by following gigabyte that was the
action that won your this
congratulations
alright so now I have pic I open and
we're going to draw the two graphics
card giveaway winners so of the 30 591
entries 30 428 of those people are
following science video whitey
which I said in the video was a
requirements eye candy and me so we're
gonna click final draw and see what it
does and a winner is Miss Fiji Ouija and
this looks like an active account miss
Fiji we G
wherever you live long as I can ship
this to you you just won yourself the
GTX 1080
right so there is no website out there
that will scrape shares of a Facebook
post you can do it for lights and
comments but what I asked you guys to do
with share and it wouldn't be fair to
just scrape the comments and there's no
API I could write my own script to
scrape this stuff but I'm not the best
coder in fact I am not in the position
to even set one of these up and be
confident that it's choosing someone at
random so what I've done here I've
literally got like it's still loading
but I'm I'm loading up pretty much every
single share we have here on the post we
have 2200 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 so
2215 i'm going to go to google open up a
random number generator and we're gonna
do minimum is 1 maximum is 2215 and
we're gonna have a pick a random them
I'm really hoping this isn't close to
the bottom because that would suck to
count 448 okay that's not bad so I'm
gonna stick with number 448 and I'm
gonna count down that many names which
is going to take a long time and and
then I'll tell you who it is so it's
gonna be someone international like I
said this was an international only
giveaway so yeah I'm not good
you know like cherry-pick a u.s. winner
or whatever I get accused of doing when
a u.s. winner wins something so here we
go 448 this is yeah I'll be here a while
248 262 look how long it takes now to
load three names 384 432 444 there's no
sellers oh cool
well alright this is this is boring 447
okay this next person wins for 48 that's
our number Gilbert not human nothing uh
Keemun d-zone think it tight you say it
Gilbert you're the winner
Darren you were really cool a hosts
razor Cruz you were really close but
Gilbert here according to our random
generator is the winner and look folks
this is totally fair in my opinion I
entered the exact number of shares the
number could have been one the number
could have been 22 15 it's a random
generator that's the point and I
literally had counted 448 names - the
few shares from we did have like enter
max share I didn't count that share we
had a few people who like shared twice
to get I guess double entry I didn't
count the second share so that's what
you know allowed me to get to this
person being 448 and so yeah
congratulations Gilbert you have just
won what is it a gtx 980ti
so awesome it's a good card great card
around 1070 performance little higher
power draw it's still gonna be able to
rock games in 1080p in 1440p without a
hitch alright folks so just to confirm
who won what and to confirm their
countries of residence that was
important the two winners that were
supposed to enter as internationals were
in fact internationals they were not
residents of the lower 48 u.s. so that's
great our twitter winner the one that GT
x 1080 lives in canada and the winner of
the 980ti lives in the philippines so
yeah that's that's gonna be pretty
expensive shipment but good thing is I
mean it's a small thing right that's why
I decided to do graphics cards for the
intern at international giveaways and
then also Tong Chester is just Chester
Chester that sounds I think it's outside
he won the the gigabyte ni max PC and
that's sitting a course right there on
the desk and he is a resident of New
Jersey so he was eligible to win and I
appreciate you guys for the vast
majority of you who followed the rules
and entered where you were supposed to
enter way it makes it fair for all of us
I hope you guys are not discouraged if
you didn't want anything there's still
plenty more to be given away in the
future we just did like what 18
giveaways yesterday again we just
announced three more giveaway winners
today and we're gonna have more stuff
going on here very soon so stay tuned
for that but thank you once again to the
companies involved in making this
giveaway possible particularly gigabyte
and enter max and then also cave them
out for spicing things up a bit and
thanks to all of you for making this
channel the success that it is and I
hope in the future we'll be able to do
more things like this so just keep
watching video so that's all that's all
I can really ask of you and we'll be
keep doing what we're doing here if you
guys like the video thumbs up you know
