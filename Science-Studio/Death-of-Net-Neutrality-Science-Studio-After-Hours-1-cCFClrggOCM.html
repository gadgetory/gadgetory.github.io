close enough
baby Coors random I doubt you paid $4.99
I don't hear any notification on my
phone yeah so uh you guys start paying
up we need that for 95 a minute $4.99 a
minute I'm still seeing no feed on the
live chat there we go
that's all it's all that lag is this
gonna switch back and forth when you
talk and I talk oh yeah there's some
special button for that somewhere Haeju
turn that on that way people can
actually see you I'm one of those people
that should be heard but not seen oh I
have another radio voices okay they can
hear you though right oh yeah they can
hear me oh yeah there he goes there's
Willie
then name.com hat oh yeah dude Greggy oh
look at the Google hangout tag not
sponsored by name com hey but you know
what if mean back on wants to sponsor us
free domains man they're more than
welcome to do some work so what's going
on we have over 400 people 436 now
watching Wow
yeah every start everyone's gonna pay up
saw the title yeah so we're saying all
right it's a $4.99 per minutes already
been a minute so everyone better pay up
so 499 times we're gonna make some Bank
in this live stream here let's see $4.99
times
let's see 456 of you watching we just
made twenty two hundred and seventy five
dollars and forty four cents all right
start paying up guys we know we don't
know where you live but uh I see that
Justin I see it see what's going on
there so for those who are wondering
this is a reference to net neutrality
but extreme but we did take a jab at it
there we also have a video dedicated to
net neutrality Austin you actually took
seriously Wow people are teaching I mean
okay I mean you've already paid like $5
you've already paid your dues brah we
appreciate that but you don't have to
keep paying $5 he's actually gonna pay
$5 per minute we're gonna like Oh guilty
about this okay we'll just
away or something yeah we didn't give it
away yeah yeah we'll do some giveaways
here at the end yeah you need to remind
me so I'll forget all right I'm gonna
figure out how to make this switch
automatically I is it switching
automatically now
oh no I'm cooking it but I can probably
figure it out oh that's pretty trash
yeah how is it doing it before Oh John
Tyler this is what freedom looks like
yeah this is capitalism guys go ahead
and start sitting your five five dollars
over so for those who are still
wondering or who haven't maybe seen the
net neutrality video or wait Jose said
he's not paying that's a permanent ban
permanent oh I see that yes yet
blacklisting put user in timeout Oh God
for five minutes bro I'm just kidding
anyway as a payback I'll let you pick
one person in the chat that we put on
timeout after you okay all right so Jose
stick around for five minutes and you
can tell us where you want us to mute it
could be anybody including you should we
do we actually ask yes yes and that
answer is yes do you get our two dollars
what is that oh that's what these are
something rupees I don't really know
let's mean YouTube like automatically
print you know not translate but like
convert the currency and I'm saying yeah
do like a super chat I think the small
super chat you can do dollar right but
then in other currencies you can do
smaller amount so I think after you you
use like would probably lose money on
some of them yeah yeah anyway really
really glad you guys are watching over
500 people live this is really awesome
I appreciate that so we really have like
no game plan but this is going to be a
set thing so every Sunday around 9
o'clock we're gonna try to live stream
will have different guests on will be
with me most of the time I want you guys
to get familiar through cos he is he's
doing a lot behind the scenes for the
channel he's been doing a lot like a
whole lot stuff that I don't even
understand he's been doing for quite a
while
thank you credit cards bongos Ditka
Quinn tat Aaron
thanks for that $1 appreciate that my
man is that is that it's where's the SS
Subaru what does that new profile
picture looks like a subi hard-wearing
box what's up dude yo yo yo yo what's
going on Steve how you doing man
Oh week actually Wow Jesus okay just
relax with it it was a joke I appreciate
you guys play it along oh my gosh okay
here we go
appreciate that x4 gaming has dsl lips D
s lips I know what that is
yeah you should you shouldn't have said
that well oh great now I'm gonna get
demonetized P o box know what no we
don't but we have we have something
similar yo Steve
sorry I'm waiting for Steve for $99.99 a
minute sir we're presents so Steve if
you don't want to pay up buddy you're
the permabanned waiting for you but you
just super chatted back you see that
little money sign down below you just
click that little button and you click
five five five five five sounds about
right what you sorted us a penny come on
whoa perfect gentleman we're expecting
that penny we're gonna start charging
interest we should nationalize the
internet says vital status statistics
whatever nationalize the internet I
think we'll has an opinion on that yeah
Oh everyone has everything oh yeah this
guy says effing lasagna made o let's
prove that commerce that comment let's
see yeah I already approved that was
good stuff
yes of course it's a joke this is a hit
on net neutrality here now the idea will
knows more about this than I do is that
if net neutrality were to suddenly
disappear then ISPs could charge extra
or you know give you what did you say it
was a little will fast lanes that we
were talking about provide fast lanes
for they're like you know partnered
websites and whatnot
yeah I mean that's what's crazy is they
you know they call it you know you know
I forgot what the bill is called but it
you know they're calling it something
like you know return the access or III
the internet act or whatever it's called
but in reality it's sort of the opposite
right and I think it's funny if you look
back at the you know you look back at
Congress and all that in 2010 2012 when
they first started talking about this it
was actually reversed right so like the
Republicans wanted in the Democrats
didn't and now the Democrats on it and
the Republicans don't and so it's sort
of uh I think it's a bi power bipartisan
issue but it's since the political
climate is what it is
that you know everybody everybody has an
opinion so because the Republicans are
in power now it's it's a Republican
spearheaded thing but yeah yeah and I
think what's funny is that you know
everybody says that you know oh the
internet should be this way the Internet
should be that way what's hilarious is
it's a bunch of old dudes in Congress
who don't own Internet companies never
have never will don't know how the
internet works like you know what I mean
like they're not like you guys are us or
whoever like they didn't grow up you
know tinkering and trying to figure out
what the internet is and so it's sort of
like you know an offensive thing where
people are like well we're gonna change
we're gonna regulate what you do you
know and in reality the people who
created you know the internet right as
we know today if they would have had to
pay off ISPs to make sure that you know
their users can get to it like that
would you know innovation would stop
right like snapchat wouldn't exist and I
mean maybe they would but not maybe not
to the same degree some would pay $100 a
day play strip I'm just saying
Brendan Whaley dude there's actually uh
money we'll talk about Chad somewheres
years that Jupiter sailing we appreciate
the five dollar donation thank you
dollars a bag of coffee would Noah
Kramer for us pray
why are you asking that know it may be
asking you will if you work for EA do I
work for you yeah who's asking
Electronic Arts Noah I can't I don't
know know what clean II need pics Little
Miss me monitor I can't see the can't
see the names this $250 4k monitors we
bought it Best Buy yeah they're actually
pretty good I don't know if you guys
yeah they're they're great I mean but
you know I'm gonna be what you see out
there let's see what do we have shoe
Bitcoin is high 87 31 USD per coin man
I think it's higher than that Alexa
what's the price of Bitcoin here we go
what it's a stellar piece of hardware
you got there Alexa what's the price of
Bitcoin I said one minute ago one
Bitcoin was nine thousand five hundred
seventy two US dollars and fifty three
slang 2013 hey hey
Sedgwick says 100 bucks for a quick nip
slip ooh
I I believe you're referring to will
write a couple
1440p IPS 144 Hertz monitor good at $400
I'm gonna go with no yeah because well
lamo busy but with you askin 1440 1440p
it 144 but I mean that also depends on
more factors than just the resolution
and the refresh rate
yeah what's the screen size first up you
can get 24 inch 144 Hertz 1440p monitors
for 400 easy Black Friday deals should
be a bit better than that yeah I know in
that Culex I was like spot-on with that
like I was one minute ago like she's on
top of her game
oh then as soon as you said that Alexa
let's just see like bulls uh Lexington
that's crazy
Bitcoin in tragedy drugs guns and
trafficking yeah I mean you know but but
like that opinion though like I don't
know it I think you can do it definitely
opens it up right like it makes it
easier for people to hide like you know
you look at the pub leska bars the world
or people that did you know move a lot
of money for legal transactions now they
don't have to do it you know they're not
to move boats and trucks of money there
they're just doing it digitally so
there's definitely some sort of you know
issue that has to be addressed there but
I mean I don't know what do you think
Greg I wouldn't even listen to you I'm
sorry in the chat Wow all right Noah no
we don't have a peel box but if you
wanted like I don't know what you need a
few box for but you're trying to like
send us something
it better be $4.99 a minute yeah at
least but if you do I mean you can tweet
at us we'll probably set up a peel box
or something I know would like the new
studio and everything set up will
probably definitely get something this
guy says maybe you should discuss the
option of nationalizing the internet and
making you this transparent state-run
enterprise but he's got like the the
hammer and sickle yeah I don't think
there's such thing as a transparent
state-run enterprise there's always
going to be some degree of on the DL all
right you know if you're not willing to
trust big business why should you trust
big government like yeah government is a
business it is to think it's like any
other entity it breeds like any other
corporation you know I think you guys
would be surprised how like without
getting into too much politics like I
think you guys would be surprised at how
and Greg and I are on issues um like I
don't think we're really left or right I
think we're I don't know left or right
realistically it's easy to get polarized
it really is nationalizing kind of
Jack's smaller or someone was too
freeing of GPS services well not
necessarily because the GPS services
have a fixed cost right like as you
increase if you had you know there's not
a whole lot of bandwidth in GPS because
you know you have a GPS receiver right
your finest GPS receivers on the
transmitter so you're not you're not
adding load to the GPS system by you
know adding a million more phones right
so I think the issue with internet right
is you get into bandwidth like you know
how can we actually get that much data
around the world and I mean you know I
don't know I think that net neutrality
sort of has a bigger context to it's not
necessarily people think about it from
the consumer standpoint about paying for
Netflix or paying for whatever but my
question would be if if you're gonna pay
for Netflix great but what about if you
if you ignore the conversation about
Comcast owning NBC or NBC on Comcast and
Hulu and all of that what about the
backbone of the internet right like what
about the level threes of the world and
the Zeos and the big carriers hurricane
electric all of them that you know
actually move a lot of the data around
the world are they going to start making
deals to where you know
the backbone of Comcast's might run on
level 3 to go to the west coast the
united states and then now all of a
sudden there's added cost to you know
VoIP traffic or whatever I think they've
already been you know prioritizing VoIP
traffic on Comcast this network you know
for years but that's just because they
say that you know if they don't if they
don't their argument is that if they
don't prioritize with traffic then you
could have lag or you know that sort of
thing grease the monkey asks why there's
a logo a Google look at the top left
that's because we're using Google
Hangouts to facilitate the stream today
brought to you by hashtag Google someone
I sold last week the read Ellen Gregg
news well you're 23 - right uh 23 what I
hear is old now I'm tweet you big ones
oh I got him yeah he does
die first actually probably not see good
I think I think competing mortality has
he's got me Boop there Sedgwick asked
what did we get for Black Friday watch
or follow us on Twitter you'll know that
we took a picture put everything up on
there yeah and it was sort of last
minute like it was kind of funny because
Greg you know Greg tweet is like the
only thing I bought from Black Friday
was this like green screen and then like
three hours later we're like hey you
want to go to Best Buy
I'm just we just walked in there and
spent way too much money
yeah it's been a lot of money more than
we were supposed to yeah
Greg how often do you twerk that's a
good question that's like every other
day yeah five gigabits per second for
streaming
let's enterprise great Internet I don't
know what you're talking about
but it's per second I live in a rural
small town in a small community I've had
the same DSL since 2009 and Verizon is
only company ok so you have you have the
only company and I pay more than most
people do for FiOS interesting you got
gigabit fiber installed this week
Comcast can suck a fat one yeah Comcast
actually has the two gigabits per second
upload and download plan I think it's
$300 but there's a $500
installation fee and there's also a
24-month contract
also have to live within a quarter mile
of learn one of their fiber notes so
there's that can you unplug and replug
your mic which one are you talking to
he's probably talking to you I don't I
can't hear my mic so I don't know if
it's good or not I'm Leslie I mean it's
like a web cam quality mic oh yeah it's
on my macbook I'm too lazy yeah unless
this thing's trashy
it shouldn't be how much World of
Warcraft gold for one minute of
streaming Gucci boom says I know where
you live all right
Ernest my dress is on the internet it's
true what did you get Wow
what J corner what does that mean
gigabit for 80 bucks that's enough for
me
not bad he's everybody's $4.99 a minute
oh that's one like three minutes yes
seriously you're paying all this money
to your ISP vote but yeah yeah it's up
to this by the way you guys see my
profile picture on the bottom left of
the screen that is um that's a really
old picture that was like from like my
sophomore year of high school yeah and
mine is a you know a little better so
yeah would be stole mine
you like the he logged into my into the
science studio account and I'm like brah
yeah this is totally different when it's
only Greg Ryan D well uh I don't that
means Ryan sounds like good mad ready
for that do you really have to pay the
answer is yes if you have to ask that
question yes
no such thing as a free lunch yeah no
such thing that's live it's live master
maybe Nick oh yeah yeah I pay 60 he pays
60 bucks a month for 60 down and 5 up
that is pretty hard to swallow Adam what
you got Caesar and TOEIC right who's the
girl you keep posting about it is Lisa
that's Gregg's sister
we're just gonna leave that one there I
paid 120 a month NZD which is like 85
USD need paypal floyd beat mayweather
yeah Ryan's 300 300 that's pretty sweet
what do you what do you guys have like
what's your bandwidth speeds and how
much are you paying by color super chat
again from Ford a story he's
sick ok for those who are not aware of
what's going on here he's donated five
bucks legit like every other minute I
got my second that he used his YouTube
budget now I pay that as well 60 bucks
for 60 down five a charter cable charter
whose charter yeah heard of them
charter turns breathing South Carolina
area alright it's more of yeah I P 110
480 down and 20 not interesting where is
Nick loving Greg everyone asked where
McLovin is McLovin is probably working
right now insert excuse year oh we're
getting flooded with the specs now here
we go 134 250 up and 10 down 104 300 up
and 300 down and 10 up 45 ish I'm on 475
down seven up I have eight up and one
down 487 a month you're getting one
megabyte a second alright
I have an idea so this is going to be
called the penny moments what bragging
will if you guys will go and there must
be tests on that run a bandwidth test
and then tweet us the results oh yeah
this will pass that's nice Evo ite and
then that will be Humphreys if you'll
tweet us Wilson will just pick one of
you guys in a second and give you like a
gift card for Amazon like 50 bucks or
something also also we want you to say
how much you're spending for that plan
that's like the other half of the
equation so whatever like if it's cable
included mention that but if you're just
paying for data you know just let us
know what you're paying to get what
you're getting I'm really curious what
you guys are having to pay especially
outside of the u.s. because it gets
really weird once you step outside our
country 40 bucks for 400 down and 50 up
stiff ninja geez
that's pretty cool
dsls one two three down up the one for
up how much for who is that they donated
I missed them I missed them trucker bomb
five bucks for Greg's hair Prague hair
product fund everybody else I'm sure
it's an astronomical amount each month
you guys you know what like I'm probably
gonna spend that five bucks because just
going chick chick take a look at this
alright I need a haircut like big-time
but we're gonna pop that name.com hat on
hashtag not sponsored by name calm oh
yeah it's definitely not sponsored by
name background really would appreciate
the free publicity though although some
people like some companies have gotten
pretty upset over people giving giving
out like essentially free advertising
here stuff like that no yeah like I
don't know why they would ever get upset
but I've seriously heard like people
will just mess around and act like
they're sponsored by companies and like
these aren't suggestive channels are
just like you know gameplay and whatnot
and these companies to go after them and
shut down their YouTube channels just
because they're like claiming to be
that's like false advertising but still
you're either webb says REO has a guitar
alright through the web also eating are
you still eating thanksgiving leftovers
no yeah sorry not five dollars but a
contribution nonetheless two dollars
well you know what we'll bill you for
the other three ninety-nine
i don't even see that one where's that
til i won't even see it
they're just scrolling through it's the
last one there oh yeah no I went to my
parents house for Thanksgiving so they
have all the leftovers I'm basically
just eating pizza rolls every day what
speed did you start YouTube on wait what
what speed did you start YouTube on oh
geez I started at my school at the time
I didn't have a wired connections I was
just going all Wi-Fi and I had about two
or three megabytes so I was around like
20 megabits per second here's a question
how does DDoS protection work so DDoS
protection can be done on the
application layer which is referred to
as layer 7 or it can be done on the
networking layer which I believe is
three or four and so the idea with DDoS
protection is if you're talk
about just sheer volume right so if
somebody sends you a hundred Meg DDoS
and your internet connection you have
like 20 down at the most right your
Internet's gonna stop working and so
what what you'll do is you'll route that
traffic through a data center that has a
lot more capacity so say you you know
just in the simplest terms if you had a
server somewhere that had 10 gigabits
right then you could take that and you
have 10 gig 10 gigs and then you could
absorb that hundred Meg's per second
filter it out right if it's like a syn
flood or something like that you can
filter that out and then push the clean
traffic to the to the actual IP address
so your real IP is never disclosed it
just goes through the filter that's the
easy explanation I guess I don't that
answer your question anyone hitting of
the 244 download speeds and getting 25
for uploads oh yeah I haven't looked at
Twitter you swishy look at Twitter
uploads and he has downloads look at
some of the tweets right now
Dennis Rigden about 80 bucks a month USD
with Verizon okay send the screenshots
not the links because I want to click on
the links oh yeah we wouldn't want that
yeah Mike come on guy it's like Google
hanging out or who it's someone asked
that was my download speed of sixty two
point five megabits per second is that
good decent bad well how much you pay
him brah it tell us how much you paying
oh yeah number three the live stream no
what's up
I never tweeted the live stream oh yeah
true I got it yeah upload in my download
yeah what's up with that like I guess
there are certain scenarios we're having
a faster upload would be beneficial but
most of the time I'm gonna be
downloading content on uploading content
that's why it's usually peppermint Bob
prioritize ninety percent ten percent
you know like ninety ten thirty bucks
per month for five point five and point
five
ouch a stain panel off for it sixty six
down here you go
this guy's got nine hundred and sixty
three down and two hundred fifty eight
up Oh switched from Comcast
with Metro net dang
now imagine I'm gonna run a speed test
for Netflix wearing a speed test for
snapchat
dude look at that one look at Justin
Perry's he's got 500 megabits per second
upload and 150 download really like what
is going on with that he said it's
included in this apartment rent free
insane Wow oh that's also but it's also
at a university yeah universities
usually have that usually they have a
static like fiber line to the hub you
know and a sheared port right so they
have a gig down there you go techno
space says as a youtuber up is more
important to me but like I mean I upload
videos every day and I can say that I
only use upload speeds to upload videos
like that's it unless you're uploading
videos all the time I would still
prioritize download speeds over uploads
maybe I wouldn't even split it down the
middle like I paint I get 500 up or 500
down 50 up I wouldn't even like give
myself 50 more ops by taking away 50 of
my downs just cuz I think 50 is fine
like I just sit and let the thing upload
do something else on the background all
right let's see here scroll through the
new tweets 83 down 11 up 163 down 204 up
that's interesting gold wolf King says
WTF who has the slowest internet if you
think you have the slowest Internet oh
dude we're gonna get into some like
kilobit per second I don't need anybody
like you know right clicking inspect and
and it says I know the struggle with Cox
and Arizona is ridiculous I had Cox in
Louisiana geez that is like a frenetic
dog never had cops it's so bad
65 down at ten recently there's a fiber
company but they only work in select
areas yeah that's actually what's crazy
about fiber a lot of the fiber you know
the United States has run underground if
you go to a lot of the developing
countries of the world now if you do a
lot of stuff of Honduras and all of
their fiber you know I got fibroids one
of our house
down there and what was crazy is that
all of the fiber optics is run on
telephone poles just like phone lines
and so on the pan-american highway if
someone smashes into a telephone pole
then you know you might knock out
Internet in part of Brazil right it's
pretty crazy
Wow eight Meg's down point seven up my
grandma does with 56k dial-up that's 10
megabit stop 1 Meg down oh man 5 and
point 5 tripping on Twitter says I'm
paying $55 for AT&amp;amp;T and he has three
Meg's down and 1.38 up ouch
they're paying $55 for that dude that's
insane 500 kilobytes down Omar where are
you in the world one point five down
point five off from DSL so you guys are
still using there's a lot of people here
using DSL but are using DSL because it's
cheaper or using it because that's
what's available in like your rural area
50 Meg's up and down with home phone and
cable for a hundred and twenty dollars
on frontier this episode of science to
you after hours brought to you by
electricity
that's fine we have fiber infrastructure
in eighty percent of the country is a
big says yeah I was gonna say that
sounds like a like a South American
country huh we're like South America I
know he didn't say where he lived but it
just sounds like a South American
country America with only one is P is
the Dillion government controlled ISP
there's the 56k dialogue aback Hall
fiber in the United States is owned by
about five companies and then this lease
between each other that's weird Boston
bar bottom tier internet $60 a month or
200 down 40 down 80 down let's go sis
I'm using DSL because it's literally the
only option in my area you know how
about um my condolences I'm gonna pick
somebody so cool it's just uh what about
this guy this is sort of like a scent of
the sympathy gift card for tripping I
guess
let's see who's paying fifty five
dollars for a tes three Meg's down in
1.38 up all right let's give him the
gift cards that cool yeah that's fine
all right cool so you got 50 bucks that
sound good 50 bucks 50 bucks
Wow well that'll fifty bucks will give
you at least one more month of your
three legs down
$8.00 there you go yeah so yeah I will
retweet this find it you will 100 down
40 up 90 AUD a month I mean it's not
terrible but that's well I mean they
have that here in the States
Jesus only DSL where I live a hundred
and twenty bucks a month for 16 down and
two up really hmm YouTube my building
offers 10 Meg's down 0.5 up for three
devices capping at one terabyte a month
50 bucks dang well that's interesting
thanks for sharing folks we're very
curious I guess that another thing would
be so well I don't know will what would
you say like if you had to group all the
first world or developing countries at
least into one big pile and pull out the
country that had the worst Internet
infrastructure which country think that
would be well you mean out of all of the
developing worlds which one has the
worst internet yeah well I don't have
any internet right um there's you know
if you look at places like Ethiopia I
mean that's not what I'm talking about
that well I'm talking about like oh no I
guess ethiop is developing but like I
mean like I I don't know just like a
country that is it has a really high GDP
or something that has like a terrible
internet service Oh like slowest country
Alexa Alexa country has the slowest
internet in the world sorry you don't
know that maiya North Korea there was a
North Korea yeah I will but North Korea
also has you know they don't really have
full on Internet access right there's
only a few people who actually have
access to the real Internet hello shut
up Navi interesting name come on come on
still kills people with fiber explain
again will how Google Fiber works like
how does the payment structure work with
Google Fiber cuz there's not like a flat
fee right under 70 bucks a month
it's just 70 bucks a month flat I think
so yeah I thought you said it was based
on the usage no no so you can there's
two ways to build fiber right
residential fiber
yeah it's $70 a month residential fiber
is billed at a flat rate a commercial
fiber or wholesale fiber is build on
what's called a 95th percentile so it's
average usage over time and then you'll
you'll pay for a port speed so if I have
a gigabit port speed and then I'm you
know averaging 23 Meg's per second which
doesn't you know it might mean that I
use eight hundred Meg's to download a
YouTube video or whatever and then but
my average is 23 right knock the top 5%
off you have your 95th percentile and
then your bill at a per Meg per second
price so you know that's how they come
up with a pricing there but the
residential stuff is usually stacked so
you're not buying dedicated bandwidth
you know Greg might buy a one gig
connection I might buy one gig
connection but you know we're sharing
some of that on the averaging on the
billing side so that's how they profit
what about Elon and lo little orbit
satellite internet it's definitely
possible Google fiber's not dead North
Korea does not have access to the
Internet everyone in Europe has been in
the u.s. yeah but a lot of that has to
do with geographical like you know like
the United States is so spread out
metropolitan marks like all of the areas
are so spread out that the
infrastructure cost are are a lot
like how many super rural places in
Europe that are like not within 50 or 60
kilometers of a big city are there in
Western Europe you know right and then
you know in the United States a lot of
the land is flat so the problem with
that is you can't use air fiber so like
products from ubiquity things like that
it's actually you know make air runs in
the mountains and that sort of thing
check that out James says in Denmark he
has two hundred two hundred at 18 bucks
a month can upgrade to five hundred five
hundred 436 I think he said Wow Wow
that's incredible that's crazy some
latency on satellite is awful yeah is
that not the delay like for people like
with cable like that's the delay when
you switch channels basically like that
like it's more about the digital
encoding right it's just because the Box
has to decrypt it right because a lot of
people used to steal cable boxes they're
trash - yeah I mean five years ago you
could climb up a telephone pole and
screw in a coax and they people still do
yeah they sawed it root cable and but
now what they've done is they've
switched it all with digital signals so
it's all encrypted and yet have you have
to authenticate with a network and then
it allows you to watch them but it has
to decrypt them off the line yeah we
want upon a crown not - am I being
charged logged out it's gone link yes
you're being charged you're being
charged for hours and 99 a minute to
watch us that's just how life works yep
30 bucks us six down one up mountainous
region same studio whitey I pay 500 INR
which is the equivalent of $7.00 us for
one gig in in myopia that's pretty crazy
it's awesome Wow
yeah I know India has really really
strong net neutrality rules it's pretty
impressive
yeah do you take food stamps
[Laughter]
unfortunately this live string is being
recorded so oh yeah all being recorded
while I have a 13 year old router yeah
you should get that looked at by a
doctor uh hundred fifty down fifteen up
462 uh 50 $60 orz whatever that is yeah
dude I had no idea when I was with my
parents still like they have a one
terabyte cap and I had no clue that was
with Xfinity so we actually passed it by
like 10 gigs and they told us they were
gonna charge us like an extra 20 bucks
per 10 gigs that we went over and I
didn't even know that was a thing like I
seriously never knew because I had never
purchased my own cable until just
recently so I never knew that there were
data caps like that I mean I knew they
were there were for mobile phones you
know for about five years ago Comcast
introduced data caps and the initial
rate of Kapil 250 gigs a month and then
they had a lot of pushback so they
decided just to go ahead and throw it
out the window but now with all the net
neutrality conversation people are
talking about beta caps coming back and
that sort of thing would you know if
Wireless like t-mobile Verizon spurn 18z
you guys have seen all of the all of the
hike where you know horizon everybody
used to have unlimited data for $30 a
month right because the network was you
know 3G speeds right so they did they
could easily handle the traffic but now
with all the live streaming
you know Instagram and snapchat and all
that sort of stuff the networks are
congested and so they switched to a per
gig model so they would sell plans and
this is in the last five years and then
they've you know in the last 12 months
they've switched back to unlimited plans
but now they limit the top 5% of their
users back down to 3G speeds after you
know 24 gigs or 26 gigs or one other one
that is God this guy said KC Sam says I
pay eighty-two dollars a month for 0.25
down in point 1 3 up and have to bundle
with an effing phone service latency so
bad I am thinking of switching to
satellite 30 Meg five Meg's up at $60
including TV and Panama
as this guy like keep he keeps like
posting the same crap over and over uh
every message cost a dollar ninety-nine
yeah Akshay most is named cat a car I
tried my best man
all right let me get this guy's gift
card to them the ones I guess net
neutrality does not stop for gig plans
and data caps what's not and that's not
we're arguing we have data caps now and
net neutrality laws are in place but if
those rules regulations were to Sonny
disappear the idea is they can do
whatever they want with any tiered
system they could say X amount of
dollars for this access X amount more
dollars for this access oh if you want
another 50 gigabytes a month for
whatever tier you purchase then you got
to pay an extra fee so having the tier
system when net neutrality doesn't exist
allows them to implement more of those
caps per tier is the idea behind that
oh I said $1.99 now yeah you better pay
that up you be a big boy
out ain't paying for Josh Saunders
is enjoying this but noticed you
included Morales oh and the latest no so
Furillo T made the thumbnail or that
little picture that I posted on the
tweet so I tagged a minute because I
wanted to give him credit but I didn't
have any more words like I didn't have
any more characters in the tweet so I
kind of had to leave it there but Tony
will be on to like we'll have Tony on
the chat probably next week I think I
don't this time we're just kind of
messing around I didn't think you'd yeah
good enough for you bro
it cost you another $50 yeah
unfortunately it may block websites they
could if they lost back we take dogecoin
for payment sure sure man yeah three
bucks for gigabit is awesome
I don't know why YouTube blocks some of
these comments like I wish it would just
like leave this he used the word
okay well alright I'm still gonna allow
it cuz screw it
oh wait did you ready click allow' oh
yeah we have a we have a censorship free
burn censorship free express yourselves
any celebrity guests yeah we're thinking
of having a we thinking I have them well
well if anybody wants to jump on the
live stream we will let you I I'm not
gonna I'm basically just gonna make it
this way since we're since we're talking
about net neutrality and supporting it
if you want to get on the live stream
your ass in this money so let's shots
the work you got you guys want the laws
changed this is how it's done
what's the minimum what's the minimum
donation they can for your dollars
uh-huh no $100 can they send like a
penny
I'm just curious I've never had to do
this before
but the highest bidder gets it because
that's how I met my child works
I expect a bill sent later Gregg also
maybe this is a way to test the
monetization well this this video won't
get to monetize this isn't like we don't
need these up for very long
how much extra do I have to pay for
censorship censorship free propell
that's a really good comment I'll
approve that one send super chat okay so
you can send let's see $0 yeah so let's
see if I send fifty cents how it works
guys you click it in your gun whoa dude
you can send 500 bucks holy crap yeah
you can like look see I'm gonna enter my
credit card and I'm gonna chain Greg two
dollars
are you seriously what is that but it
came it came from Greg's account cuz I'm
logged into his peon sorry good game bro
wow I just we just chatted ourselves
Jesus hey not exempt from paying alright
Santa hats are copyrighted and a hats
are copyrighted it looks like we're just
gonna keep this one to monetize we're
relying on your donations now a $1 for
every megabits per second download they
have yes Josh we just gave ourselves two
dollars yeah don't don't you want to
give a cut to YouTube but then get it
back in your bank account 45 to 60 days
yeah yeah it's it take that long
seriously yeah it takes a long time G
well I know YouTube takes like a month
to pay out so I came here for dude
that's like that's worth a lot of money
so yeah sure by all means it's 500
bitcoins you can actually send 550
bitcoins
okay can I pay can I pay for a super cat
with a virtual high five
no Greg you need up these rates to $7.99
per minute
yeah we're getting too much traffic you
is too much too much demand we'll check
your accounts with a one big old going
your way
whatever that means Stumbo me ISP can
block and throttle websites now even
with net neutrality that's what Comcast
did to Netflix last year it was truly
good we were just talking about this
yeah they did but they stopped it
afternoon let's bait them all they say
they stopped it baits reveal of $15
wait what he's gonna reveal
face man talk about himself Oh 28 69
cents you can donate $69 though hey I
had to watch an ad when I got in so I'm
pretty sure it's monetized yeah but
who's to say we don't like not get that
money but I'm pretty sure when when our
videos get demonetised on YouTube I know
people still get ads on there I'm pretty
sure they just don't give us the money
yeah is it the livestreams monetized
ready to know yeah but even you guys
have to realize the amount of money that
comes from ads not
oh it's trash yeah most go using ad
blocker anyway so we're getting screwed
over yeah first thing about being a tech
tool is that you read the audience uses
adblock yep that's about 50% of you guys
use that lot yeah you guys are just
smart yeah we use it ad block and bunch
of smart cookies 347 am is there a
discount on off-peak hours oh but what I
would tell you is your power company
gives you a discount on off-peak hours
see if you think the savings and apply
them to your science video account boom
boom if you keep copying kaak kaak star
if you keep copy and pasting the same
dumb thing over and over YouTube I pay
500 INR which is equivalent to 7 USD for
10 thousand megabytes per second which
is oh let's I don't understand you to
use a capital B there's a difference
tween a capital M B and a capital M
lowercase B bra I mean I kind of get
what he's saying is Tim Giggy for 7
bucks is it good I feel like that's not
true thinking a bits per second yeah
yeah yeah even will not buy
international bandwidth in Honduras I I
mean even dark fiber is not that you
yeah yeah it's okay
you're forgiven pot this is if I you're
forgiven maybe that's how you get to
give them in this world do you still
know if you get address when someone
uses YouTube bread yes that's for sure
no matter what so when you basically
with YouTube read what you're doing is
you're paying like a subscription fee
see you don't see ads and you get extra
benefits included with that but we get a
proportion that actually when it breaks
down our monthly earnings it shows us
how much of our earning
is from YouTube bread it's like I think
for us it's only like five or six
percent it's not very big yeah let's see
YouTube you know you paid $10 for
YouTube right or whatever and then if
you're watching a ton of YouTube videos
right then you're actually making
YouTube lose money but there's you know
hundreds of thousands of people that are
you know paying for YouTube bread but
maybe watch one video every day you know
so it all balances out and they pay a
CPM it's pretty comparable looking for
dinosaurs what do you think of YouTube
bread first adblock well YouTube red I
mean you're paying for one adblock
you're not paying for Jack except for
your internet connection
so YouTube bread helps us like we do
gets we do get kickbacks from that when
you watch a video we get like like micro
pennies on the dollar but it's still
something when you use adblock we don't
get anything because no ads show up and
YouTube knows that so when you put in
you know when you when you have ad block
running and you load up a YouTube page
and you jump straight into the video
Google says well the hell I'm they
didn't see an ads we're not gonna pay
for that ad right it wasn't implemented
you think does the end do you know what
Tandy 1000 is what does that well I
don't know do you think will win
defending net neutrality um
I'll look it up Tandy 100 I really don't
know how it's gonna go down because it's
not it's not like a vote of Congress I
don't believe right I think it's an FCC
vote and so it really doesn't matter
what we think it really matters what you
know everybody in the FCC is like where
you know where they are on the Tandy
1000 this is coming from who donated the
$2 I was Jesse n so Tandy 1000 is the
first in a line of more or less IBM PC
compatible computer home systems
produced by the Tandy corporation for
sale in its Radio Shack chain of stores
interesting Radio Shack's out of
business now so wonder what the fate of
Tandy was is this livestream sponsored
by Taco Bell
I don't know fat joke earth that's like
I wasn't even thinking like that but now
do you say it it could have been a bad

that's real don't make fun of my weight
she
yeah transcripts back alright okay y'all
are so mean Congress can override the
FCC with lawmaking Authority after the
fact if they choose five-second ad is
nothing just watch to support the
creators yeah I mean I'm not gonna sit
here and tell you guys not to use
adblock I mean who cares but you know at
the end of the day it's sort of like a
principle right look if you if you
support the creators you watch then you
know watch the ads right if not if you
don't like watching ads by YouTube red I
mean what's the you know ten bucks a
month yeah I mean a lot of people watch
YouTube more than they watch Netflix so
like you're paying like but I don't
Netflix subscription went up by like a
bucks and now I'm paying like fourteen
dollars instead of thirteen a month so
what YouTube Reds like what ten bucks a
month there's ten that oh yeah can we
get a sponsor read what's the sponsor
read sure what do you want me to say
it's sponsored by I don't have any
crunchy tacos sorry it's got to be soft
tacos unless it's a fiery Doritos locos
taco cuz that's what's up
this isn't sellouts to go right now I
don't really uh tony says I've read the
Bible sixty nine times and in the book
of Greg four twenty Jesus says he who
had used AdBlocker shall never have
their weiner touch my yeah I feel like
you regretted and say reading that about
your I didn't read it
thanks Tony thanks man appreciate and
everyone's gonna be like chipping that
might know just don't have audio thank
God
donation time what's up looking for
dinosaur is gonna go broke over here you
think YouTube TV is worth it I actually
think it's kind of overpriced yeah I get
it too I wait you said it was like 1099
no YouTube TV not you - Bret saw our
YouTube TV oh oh yeah 35 bucks on them
and it's only available in select
markets yeah
Doritos Locos Tacos are like the best
thing ever that's the one hard talk
about the eat
is skipping the ad after five seconds
count or do i watch the whole
we still get paid for that yeah I don't
I don't yeah like I mean I don't think
it really uh I don't think it really
matters so I'm not gonna sit here and
tell you I sit there and watching my lad
you know I'm sitting there waiting for
that right but we stayed but it's that
like you said it's the principle right
so like yeah you don't view the whole ad
we still get it we still get a small
kickback from it and III don't know like
exactly what the proportion is like if
they pay out the whole like the whole
thing or if they pay only a part like a
portion of it like if that's the case
who cares you know it click skip anyway
if you can they're giving you the option
I'll blame you at that point yeah I mean
it to me I just bought you know you to
bread right like I just don't want the
ad to heat ads but your sister said I
love live streams hearing Greg Reed that
was perfect and now I know why I don't
get laid Oh red when you can go down
with a tweak box and download YouTube
plus plus that doesn't show at YouTube
I feel like a blocker is easier YouTube
red gives you google play music which is
basically a four-person version of
spotify bond without $9.99 as a steal
someone said Jeff is proud yes that is
definitely not true
but you could try you're getting trolled
I let my bet and my friend borrow my PC
and he returns at full malware paying
one pay my paying my one cent with
interest sir appreciate that mr. Shelby
oh yeah that was the yeah that was the
person who donated like $2.99 he told me
yes we want the interest would be and I
told him to be one hundred and eighty
percent APR so he's paying right you
guys are just tuning in this is $4.99 a
minute to watch us bless you with our
presents oh yeah this is uh how many
trolley works so start paying up here
someone says a jiff as in his gift it's
not gif not gif don't be weird
Bobby reason Bobby all of your comments
get blocked and I don't know one whoa
Roland Dawson says
one time I watched an ad that Greg had
that was an hour long and skipped it at
the last second it's the pettiest thing
I've ever done yeah I don't think that's
worth it dude because uh I mean we can't
like talking about numbers right but
like I can give you a general idea of
you know the way YouTube works and it's
like there's its cost per thousand so
it's you know your one ads not a whole
point one percent bro yeah it's okay
we don't feel bad Greg you're dumb nail
scared the crap out of me I thought it
was real you can thank will for that
that's all we'll engineering over here
yeah I just I made that just just a
troll people YouTube red has four month
free trial right now for Black Friday so
does Apple music Apple music has a three
month free trial it's trash I don't
recommend it oh yeah and I have an
iPhone and in Auto it Auto renews which
is the worst part CSM Utley get people
that's like the free trial with Netflix
like you have to enter a card now I know
that was one of the things I wanted to
talk about with the app store I remember
when I had like my first ipod touch like
and I was like fifteen or fourteen it
took me a while to get one but I had I
got my first iPod touch and you download
the app store you create your little
Apple account and then you can just
download apps if you wanted to buy apps
and you had to add a credit card after
the fact now in order to even create an
Apple account you have to sync up a
credit card like no matter what I didn't
know that it's like they're basically
getting you trigger-happy and if you
accidentally miss click something you
know that that OneTouch buying options
like they do on Amazon
oh yeah dude only an app purchases dude
it's a money-making machine and they're
playing off of people's ignorance which
i think is pretty messed up yeah and I
mean on you know on the iPhone and and
all of the in-app purchases now you can
buy things on websites right like
Shopify has integrations with it and
everything else where they'll actually
charge your iTunes account for the
transaction all you need is that
thumbprint or the face ID or whatever
right okay I'm blogging I do too keeps
like copying and pasting all this crap
Dennis Rigden my dude $20 appreciate
that I offer you this twenty as a bulk
price for that five dollar minute bit
take it or off also Apple music is
so bad I'll have to try it just so I can
like be on the same boat as you guys
because I've never clicked it just cuz I
don't do that kind of music I just
download music like I have like my own
library of stuff I've purchased from way
back when and that's just keep adding to
it but like I've never wanted to use
google play music or out the music or
anything like that
so what you say Greg do you want jump
bring people into their hangout with us
yeah let's bring Denison see if Dennis
wants to come in
yo Dennis how are we gonna chat this to
him I don't know let me figure it out
Will's gonna try to figure it out hey
Dennis we're gonna try to bring you into
the chat man we've done this before for
those who are new to the live stream
thing or at least with the Google
Hangouts interface we can actually bring
other people into the live stream so you
can see yourself on the channel
basically it's kind of cool it's
different than YouTube more personal
yeah I don't know if that's gonna work
like we want it to what we could do we
could just open it up to the masses for
maybe I don't know 15 minutes and then
call today yeah I don't know yeah we're
got to get better about um possible
Robin Estrada's comment I can afford you
hangout prices how much stage fright
Dennis alright alright we're gonna see
let's just let's just link it out there
and let's see Dennis you got to be quick
my man oh dude this show you can Dennis
that he can't yeah Dennis Lee can't uh
we can I mean we could just try that
both stage fright oh I didn't realize
reading its comment okay yeah just like
post it out there we'll just get people
coming in oh god yeah bring it flooded
that's okay come on alright guys here's
the rules we're gonna post this chat
little turbo hangout thing you can join
ask your questions stay on here for like
you know talk for a solid 15 seconds and
then GTFO 15 seconds 15 like maybe not
exactly you know but you know
try to keep it short because there's 500
people or 400 now or losing people well
you're basically like power questions so
you gotta get your questions spit out
I'm gonna answer as quick as I can as
concisely as I can and then we're gonna
move on the next person just so we're
fair to everybody when you jump in it
how about you guys knew your mics cuz it
sucks
yeah mute your mics brah all right we'll
all right let me get the link scary
mm-hm press f to pay respects everyone's
tripping oh yeah click it do it do oh
he's spamming hard yeah you're gonna see
it
alright everyone about to join it's
gonna suck alright oh geez I've got one
person two people oh yeah nobody alright
alright mute you mute you and you you
remember ya meet yourselves when you
come in everyone will be talking all at
the same time it gets really really bad
hey for some reason when it shows you it
doesn't show everyone in the oh there
you go no it does
are you tinkering with it alright so see
for like pressing F all over the boy
alright guys also mute your mics mics
for me too but mute your livestream in
the background if you have it playing in
the background just focus on Google
Hangouts
um and then let's just try to go for it
so uh naughty cord I'm gonna got petting
its pillow down there let's go with
naughty cord what's up dude hey how's it
going yeah what's up man not much that
much you want to question anything like
that I don't know I'm not from the USA
so I'm not too happy about the entire
ality but it's something that I think
it's gonna affect the Canada as well
like if it gets put in place it's gonna
affect us in somewhere or the other do
you think it's like
gonna change something for us or no what
do you think well yeah I mean it could
right because I mean if you're accessing
a service that's based in the United
States right right now it's all about
low latency so if there if it's you know
better to have a server in Quebec then
they're gonna have a server backup it's
better to have one in Chicago they're
gonna put it in Chicago well when you
start putting these national laws in
place then you know now now it becomes
the question of or the lack of laws
right then it becomes the question of
you know what is something restricted in
the United States right did we become to
the point where companies restrict
things over certain networks so instead
of you know traffic going through
Chicago because it's lower latency you
know they go somewhere else because that
state doesn't have you know laws that
block the content right so but it's a
longer it takes longer to get there the
latency is higher and the slows are the
speeds are slower but yeah I think it I
think especially since it's something in
the United States where a lot of these
tech companies are based and that sort
of thing
I think people forget that a lot of the
infrastructure is also based here I mean
there's definitely a significant amount
in Canada too but yeah I think it will
yeah yeah I was thinking of Facebook
Facebook doesn't have any server in in
Canada really there's like there's like
two data centers in Sweden and there's I
think there's one in Chicago and that's
it interesting not sure I'm not sure
though yeah thanks for your question
dude I'm we're gonna try to get those
many people as we can
oh sure and yeah have a good day let's
see if we can get who was next
rock rock old that oh what's up how you
doing what's up dude what's going on now
I'm just chillin that's livestream I was
like okay why am i paying $4.99 to watch
the stream I was mad as but I'm
like oh wait a minute did you pay your
$4.99 oh maybe a pay or $4.99 about the
perma ban you where'd you go did you
meet yourself if needed
all right you're still there oh you got
a question for us uh yea well jhonny
like Canada make it hard to walk to
animate or knit so that's why I'm upset
it's like one of the good anime well
Jesus and out of there all right so
let's try this again guys remember all
right please mute your mics and mute the
audio in the background if you're on the
Google hangout you don't need to listen
to the YouTube stream all right I had a
pretty valid question but couldn't
answer it uh it was a valid question
though all right Seth man man Seth man
Gary here dude yeah I'm here um I'm
another guy from Canada and okay other
guy kind of answered my question um do
you think this is also going to affect
like Canadian companies who some of the
murder like unite in the United States
and some of the American companies that
are in Canada you think it's gonna
affect them like crazy because like
they're trying to put their businesses
up and the cost of Internet it's gonna
go up in some places and it's gonna
affect like how can I runs our stuff
because Canadian Internet is already
super expensive and stupid some areas
like a hundred megabits per second
upload
I mean download speed is sometimes over
a hundred bucks and just Ontario alone
it's more expensive to go to or you
think it's gonna affect a lot of stuff
like that
yeah I mean I think well I think it'll
be twofold right so I think that in the
first five years I don't think we'll
notice at all I think the people who are
non Texas gonna do go ahead and meet
your keep live stream other than me but
I think that it's gonna affect it from
the side like in the next five years I
don't think anybody's gonna notice I
think what comes up is you're actually
not gonna see price as a bandwidth go up
I think what you'll see is is not the
opposite but I think you'll start seeing
the freemium model
you know become relevant in in the
internet right so we're people if you
know if AT&amp;amp;T can you know acquire a
customer by giving them a $5 a month
social media package right so that you
know their kid can watch YouTube videos
in the car while they're driving around
and that's all they want them to have
access to it then I think that's what
will happen but I think the issue
becomes later on you know well then now
that kids not able to access anything
other than that and it you know if
you're gonna do these like segmented
packages and I think that's where it
gets dangerous and and but I mean it
affects everybody right because if if
the upstream providers like level 3 say
all of them you know if they change it
to say ok well we're we're gonna
discount
you know HD video because that's you
know we like we like moving that data
more than we like moving encrypted data
then I think it's fine I think you'll
get into an issue where a lot of cable
companies a lot of Internet companies
are owned by larger media companies if
you guys remember about 10 years ago the
whole DMCA Act the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act we the thing where people
always get YouTube videos taking down
for and all that sort of stuff the you
know people send down a you know send a
takedown notice right for that today but
LimeWire all of those things the ISPs
wanted to block the traffic the
torrenting traffic which torrenting in
itself is not illegal but what people
use it for can be right and so you know
using something like tor BitTorrent any
sort of encrypted transmissions could be
blocked by your ISP just because they
don't want you know they want to cut
down on all the copyright right right so
cool Greg who's next no you pick man I'm
not in control that's the I love the
internet let's go to Bob what's a Bob
hey so
seeing that there's so many Canadian
people do you think you're gonna do more
Canadian content Hey what do you mean
Canadian content like what I don't know
more Canadian feels I don't know a mass
like about 50% of our your bases United
from the United States and about I think
12 or 13% of Canadian actually might be
less than that I think it's like close
to 10% it just wouldn't make much sense
fretts just as like people like Steve
will tell you like Steve and and Brian
the guys that they live over there in
Australia they always say their price is
first and they'll convert it to USD
because they know that a large portion
their audience is also from the United
States but it wouldn't do us much good
at all to do Canadian based deals and
stuff like that if most of our viewers
aren't from Canada I think it's just a
matter of statistics is all that is
think of the three out of three people
that called in today we're all Canadian
yeah but our Google Analytics says
otherwise about yeah Bob it's not gonna
make any difference I'm from Canada and
our dollar is crap so yeah we're okay
that's just dumb where's word and we're
never gonna be talked about in anything
that doesn't make any sense I apologize
I don't mean to be rude from Canada but
yeah it won't happen I would have to say
like even if even if you guys had I
guess it would be easier if our dollars
were this about the same strength but
even if they were let's say they were on
a one-to-one I still would do most of my
content would be centered around the
United States market just because that's
where I live that's where I'm most
familiar with I know what deals are good
here in this country and it's harder for
me to relate to countries outside of
here because they have different pricing
structures they have different tax
brackets they have all kinds of stuff
that goes into effect that I don't know
about so I don't want to act like I do
and say oh this is a great deal in
Canada even though I don't live here so
it's it's more or less just a matter of
like where I'm comfortable dealing and
I'm not comfortable doing it in another
country
that definitely makes sense Thanks yeah
hey man thanks for question thanks Bob
well I was gonna ask if you think net
neutrality is gonna come to Canada I
don't think it will but just out of
curiosity right well it's hard to hear
yeah um no I don't I don't think that
the regulations right I mean you know
they're talking about rolling back
something that they put in place that
prevents you know people from doing it I
think that the question of it really
hasn't come up anywhere else in the
world necessarily but I think people I
think companies reactions in the United
States like ISPs instead of them saying
you know oh well look like the cellphone
companies right like we have all of this
you know people are using all this
bandwidth to get on Netflix and YouTube
and Spotify and all that sort of stuff
but instead of increasing our network
capacity like tenfold right like let's
go ahead and just prioritize traffic you
know let's let's slow down other people
and I think the one of the biggest
misconceptions is that they talk about
okay well let's get rid of net
neutrality so that we can you know
create these fast lanes well I can tell
you if Netflix pays you know Comcast 20
million dollars they're not gonna lay
new fibre for Netflix right they're just
gonna prioritize the traffic that's
already on the existing infrastructure
and and that's when you know not it's
not a win-win right like it's you know
somebody I agree with you there because
I think what was happening I'm I think
was like three to five years ago in
Canada um we had cellphone companies
from the states trying to get up here
cuz our cell phone services argh okay
but I pay like a hundred and fifty bucks
a month for my cell phone and I only get
like five gigs of data like it's it's it
is it is stupid and because Bell Rogers
tell us they own Canada's cell phone and
they said well we put the infrastructure
in no you're not coming unless you pay
us a hundred million dollars to come up
here some outrageous number and they
kind of held everybody off which is crap
because you guys have awesome and
awesome cell phone prices out there
compared to us but then our internet
here I was doing a little research on it
our internet here is kind of government
regulated they can't they can't limit
anybody but they can almost charge us
whatever
they want like if you live on a farm out
here oh god you're you're gonna be
paying or $500 a month for like a
hundred gigs like it's dump and and 35
up and nothing else like it's crap yeah
I would like to see like a map kind of
like just of the United States for one
so that I'm more familiar with these
prices again but but I'd like to see how
the pricing structure differs from
between like rural places and urban
places or suburban places like what are
the what are the different prices that
people are paying location based right
so it's not only about how many ISPs you
have in your area but also about how far
you are from you know wherever they're
splitting this stuff off I wonder if
yeah broadband map go but is it going to
show us prices like it has like a price
density map like that's I would be
really interested to see something like
that yeah probably not not sure why it
would requires so much data you'd have
to have a sample from literally a signal
probably has it they do a lot of
analytics with cell phone companies but
I'm not sure if they do anything with
you know wired or Wireless well it's
these cell phones a little different I
mean you pay it and you either get the
service or you don't like it's just like
a flat you know rather giddy because
it's all Wireless but with the wired
stuff like you're actually paying for
that infrastructure and some to some
extent there sometimes they have to come
out and lay the cable for you yeah I
just I wonder what the what the prices
are maybe like price per megabit or
something like that
awesome yeah that's usually how it works
what about angry tech what's up angry
tech yeah we can't hear you
so can't hear you okay here you give me
a thumbs up anyway man give me a just me
that there we go that's what start come
back okay we'll just assume you asked
something about net neutrality because
that's what everyone else is been asking
a bit all right all right all right man
we got fall Bros it's not a thing up
dude
yo oh yo hear me
that's an affirmative okay so I have a
cue 6,600 machine with six gigabytes for
ham and a 1050 so I'm trapped I want to
upgrade it but I still want to keep the
1050 what would be an upgrade path for
the computer with a 1050 I just go like
with a risin three or something and
fifty is that what you said
okay texts 1050 you want to use
everything well it's just like a
placeholder so that I don't have to
spend a ton of money on the graphics
card so like down the line I'll get a
better graphics card so because by the
time that I get all the other stuff that
I need it's gonna be like two
generations of graphics cards yeah I
would say if you're planning on keeping
the 1050 then and for a while they still
you upgrade if you want a platform like
a CPU motherboard Ram combo that'll last
you four five six years and I would say
go with something like horizon 5 go for
like a 1400 or maybe a 1600 if you can
work it out go for 8 gigs of ram and
then upgrade to 16 later if you want use
the 10 v you're gonna get decent frame
rates especially in 1080p the 1050 is a
little under kill I will say but if you
upgrade that to a 1070 later on let's
say let's say you get a use 1070 for
like 200 300 bucks like that's a good
price for one right now
then I you'll be sitting really good
because that's a really good value combo
right there like horizon 510 70ish so
that's what I would shoot for just kind
of hang out with that 1050 for a while
upgrade that q 6600 platform still a
great I mean it's a quad-core CPU right
but it's based on what like 2000 and I'm
gonna miss I'm gonna miss State this
year I think it's like 2006 I want to
say the Q 6600 something like that it's
pretty old
like it's over a decade old so yeah
upgrade that platform first I can tell
that it's like seriously black
bottlenecking
my yep it will yeah that's exactly
what's that's cool even a 1050 it'll
bottom like a 1050 it's hard to believe
but it actually will do that
by man that's the luck appreciate you
appreciate you get on the livestream
alright we got Jack Quinn - Ron oh God
it's it's D Quinn - Taryn and I already
talked and asked my question I'm just
listening in guys
oh yeah no cool sweet Greg by the way
the 10 70s in Canada even used are like
370 plus well I couch my eyes out that's
pretty insane yeah I paid I haven't I
have a GeForce GTX Strix and 60 OC I got
it on Amazon and I like I scrounged
around to find the best deal and I still
paid 436 for a10 64th just in the middle
of the mining crazy so how long ago was
this this was two months ago okay so
it's a downturn it but still you paid a
lot more that was that was the best
price still right now there they've gone
down about 20 bucks Vince yeah that's
insane that's what we pay for a 1070
here I know and I actually want to run a
1070 in my my system yeah and still I
haven't it's like 500 bucks plus for a
1070 here yes plenty territory for us
yeah it's retarded man retard instead
below even they give me up it's I I
honestly just want to get my car and
drive to the states buy it and bring it
back
ideally I'd the Canada or not Canada
people live in like Vancouver and
Toronto I could imagine it'd be pretty
feasible although it'd be difficult
trying to get that through customs but
ya know cuz I just put it in a computer
like a case on my way down like in the
in the car with me on my way down I'm
going to a gaming event come back up
with the exact same asus strix card in
it
watch out man big brother's watching
what do ya'll call big and I'd like a
big brother saying in Canada
no man I can still use like I can still
use pirate bay here they just it a whole
bunch of add like a whole bunch of
windows will pop up and say hey you're
not supposed to like they're slapping
your wrist and you just X out and you
can still use them here there's no real
laws against any of that here
uh there's a couple like Internet
companies that'll like they'll throttle
you for a month if you're caught doing
too much torrent downloading but other
than that no like I it it's it's it's
dumb here I hate it here I'm I want to
move to the states so bad man you have
no idea Canada who live here so maybe
you know what honestly I would take
Trump over frickin Trudeau whatever all
day long livestream room move on we get
some other people we're gonna actually
be hanging up here soon I don't have
much longer I got some schoolwork to get
to I know that's like serious downer but
all right man V no more man whatever
what's up you know got me mad if it's
you can come back Matt instead anyway
hello from Israel it's right now 6 a.m.
I think what a lot to talk about is more
so basically about cell phone prices and
internet prices like here I pay for
unlimited and kept data for like 15
bucks so yeah that's a faint here and we
have a net neutrality laws and
everything so basically the difference
is that they cannot book any website and
they cannot block any service even
though like yeah we have the free
infrastructure companies and you will
pay for the is be a different payment
and we have like 20 I speak companies
and still they don't allow like we don't
have a monopoly my daughter'll blocking
without allowed hearing and don't about
anything like that so yeah that's where
you should be going and although this
start suing the companies that we
started to do anything like that like
blocking or tearing prices yeah that's
stupid what's going on where what part
of Israel are you from very slightly
part I'm just the closer to the center
but yeah it's more country yeah yeah for
sure
the what is it Tel Aviv you guys have
got a pretty crazy technology scene over
there
right now there's a lot of startups
coming out of there a lot of Technology
it's getting built over there I guess in
Tel Aviv now basically a really big
company in the world has a R&amp;amp;D center in
Israel but it's small North in Tel Aviv
like Tel Aviv is just a basic it's like
the New York of Israel yeah but were
spread out all over I mean like all the
internships are being developed in
Israel apparently all the processors so
yeah but the thing is about the net
majority that we had lows from thousand
in eleven I think not me too chatty but
they still permit like we still say
something about it's fair use like you
cannot overuse it's and then they are
allowed to slow you down or whatever but
they cannot really because you cannot
prove that you use the internet too much
or whatever right so yeah good luck with
effort it's really important yeah yeah
yeah no really know what she brew but
Bogert oh nice one it's about all I got
insulting sure but no it's not it's
actually really good yeah I've been
there a couple times that's right you
take it Israel forget about that yeah
I've been there comes hiked Timna I was
fun yeah that's a self yeah yeah it's
really hot to them
yeah jib to our yeah you want to Regis I
know Jordan and Israel and now I thought
you're in Cairo or the border border
crossing to Egypt is a lot harder to get
through them to Jordan because the
physical Jordan is a lot better than
with Egypt yeah but still you can just
go through some kind of bullet pass yeah
always too much of your time even me on
Twitter or something I'll take you to
dinner next time I'm over there okay oh
that's really one or two more we'll all
right we got
ooh Daniel Paige what's up dude Daniel
hey yo what's questions be quick we're
trying to get through everybody
yeah no now I kind of feel a little bit
useless after that good conversation you
guys just had I was just asking them
well what kind of overclocked settings
have you been able to get on an RX 480
with just a stock cooler and no water
block or anything like that it's that
well I got my eye
I usually I'll confess I usually don't
over Clark cards anymore I just don't
even bother most of them will kind of
throttle themselves so if you take like
I know I'm more familiar with this with
Nvidia cards I know that they will
throttle heavily when they get pretty
hot they'll drop to 300 megahertz and
when they're cooled appropriately
they'll stay maxed out clock speed I
mean when you have to touch them and
they'll actually go overclocked to some
extent or they have that boost clock is
what they gets basically Auto
overclocking on a and B huh skillet
things
what's up yeah what is a what's a fairly
acceptable temperature for like a
reference cooler Arak 480 no no it's not
a reference it's an MSI it's got two
fans okay you don't want any card
getting above like 85 C like that's I
would say if you're if you're in like
the mid to low 80s you're fine getting
into 90 degrees is unhealthy unless it's
a Hawaii or excuse me a Fiji GPU which
like r9 390 or ninety to ninety X that
type deal so unless it's Fiji it
shouldn't get above 85 I would say okay
okay and what about temperature wise on
the horizon are 1700 rising any CPU
shouldn't get above 80 I would say same
thing around mid 80s like if you're
getting close to water boiling
temperature then it's too hot and what
will happen is the CPU will throttle
itself you'll know when you get too hot
your CP will throttle or in some cases
with rise and the peace feel completely
shut off so okay that's pretty much what
I've thought I've just been always
afraid to push it because I've always
stuck
like 65 70 something safe temperatures
there sorry man we gotta go we gotta
move on to other people but I appreciate
it thank you guys
oh man thing is he already what about
Aaron Montu whatever
Aaron whose last name looks like postman
long once twice sold done alright see
you later buddy
Andrey's gosh man alright the guy that I
just I muted oh I can't hear me ah this
is the only question I have how order
ISP monopolies in the US because I'm not
Canadian or American and from a
third-world country in South America why
are there monopolies
like in terms of highest peace how are
they able to get that construction laws
permits the fact that the FCC actually
allows them to be monopolies but they
regulate pricing on utilities yes but
like people are not willing to pay well
not for the initial but for the service
afterward to get that infrastructure
from that company in the first place
what do you mean for example here we
most buildings they are not individual
houses we there's compounds right and
they're administered by a single person
they're like apartment buildings but
spread out right and those get offers
from the ISPs to build infrastructure in
those buildings - so - people yeah
there's like five different companies in
the buildings
I live in how does the US don't have
that they have more money do you have
more spending power yeah on a
micro-level the US does that with
apartment complexes but the difference
is to keep construction costs low I mean
you know if we wanted to bring in
Comcast and say three other cable
companies that's three or four different
runs inside the building right to get
that cable to differ but what they do is
they just have you know also the entire
apartment complex - Comcast
right so if you want internet you're
gonna buy it from Comcast if you want TV
you're gonna buy it from Comcast if you
don't or say you wanted Wow or you
wanted Cox or Mediacom or any of the
other ones you could call them and ask
them but they're just not going to be
able to do it because the apartment
complex is not going to give them you
know the the authority or whatever to
actually go in there and do it that's so
sketchy yep money talks man yep all
right okay
Thank You Man
all right that's not even a word so I
can't be yelled at for not pronouncing
that what's up last name clan with
rising bosses of epicness I can read
that one what's up dude oh that's why
your audios trash in a t-rex costume
that's alright
what is pretty trash you back oh wow
thanks that's alright they say the same
all right quick question my favorite
build yeah I like the Andromeda I really
like the Andromeda that was a really fun
build I think it looked really good some
just mean it like the game though right
no hate again go man three costumes do
it yeah alright that was interesting
what's India with octane gamer what's up
dude hey hear me well yeah okay yep sup
okay one question I have a cool HD 1750
that goes up to 90 as really hot yeah
sure I had several pods or however they
stood cooler okay repeat that little
slower cuz the audio is kind of trashy I
was a
I'll put my mouse Kosan like my HD 7850
goes up to 90 yeah should I replace type
of thermal heads or should I replace the
cooler
have you already replaced the the the
the thermal paste yeah I did
they did it yeah I would do that first
we didn't worry about your about your
cool or whatever I would swap the
thermal paste first did you probably
some really terrible caramel pay they
rotted over the past five years that
you've that it's been in existence so
that would be my first thing you any
pitcher is a bit high though okay again
just swap your thermal paste dude that's
what I would do okay okay oh thank you
though
all right that worked well so that was
interesting see T Rexes um
Jehovah's Witness is man you never know
what's gonna happen oh it was lovely
well for those who are still around we
appreciated the 300 or so who who stuck
around I think we peaked at like five
2530 which was pretty sweet I was a
really nice wall to do some things extra
to keep them around next time maybe have
some actual topics to discuss instead of
just like improving which is my what's
up I'm sure much speed oh yeah will in a
speedo will definitely attract certain
people female ratios away up on your
channel Bob Bob says use alcohol that
might be an option Tony of the jovis
witnesses and t-rex comes back and maybe
a t-rex is my spirit animal okay sorry
