purchased the Samsung Galaxy s7 what a
coincidence the numbers kind of line up
like that is I didn't remember the
original Samsung Galaxy so they came in
like four or five different variants
from different phone carriers but wow
those phones were such crap but I'm here
to say with certainty that after using
the iPhone 7 for several months the
galaxy s7 is a better phone for me so
that's right let's sold the iphone to my
friend and use that money to purchase
this so from just a price standpoint
alone the s7 is a better Buy got it for
500 bucks compared to the $700 I paid
for the iPhone only a few months earlier
keep in mind the s7 was released earlier
as well so that price is kind of line up
with their release dates if you're
thinking to yourself Greg why do you buy
the s7 when the s8 will be released
around March well that's because I
wanted to show all of you that you can
spend less money to buy something even
better than the Apple competitor which
will still be their flagship phone until
next September or there abouts look I
understand the whole Apple ecosystem
argument okay I was there I purchased a
MacBook and iPhone 7 and Apple sport
watch all at the same time just to
understand where people were coming from
when they said Apple ecosystem I
actually made a video right here
explaining the cohesiveness and actually
praising it just for being so effortless
and harmonious all three of those
devices working together so well but
it's a double-edged sword and I realize
that now that I ventured outside of the
system itself if you try to introduce a
product that's not from Apple into the
system it becomes very very resilient
it's to be expected from Apple but it
was still a huge letdown I had to sell
my Apple watch against my will because
it only works with other Apple products
on the contrary you can use Samsung year
to to communicate with virtually any
phone regardless of the operating system
iOS integration is still a bit finicky
but it'll get there the point is they're
trying at least they're trying it's
something everyone interested in mobile
tech knows Android is open it's freely
navigable I want to jump right into your
phone's root filesystem no problem one
extract specific files from your phone
no problem these operations are
extremely limited on the other side of
the aisle and many aren't willing to
trust some each other jailbreaks offered
on various site so what exactly do I
like more about the Samsung Galaxy s7
that made me switch in the first place
well an open file system for starters
you kind of expect that with Android I
knew this going into the whole thing by
the way the ability to change and
customize entire launchers also
something most people know about going
into it but it's still nice to have and
when you don't have it it kind of sucks
because everyone's iPhone looks the same
on the home screen the fact that a
headphone jack exists yeah I had to say
it okay just get over it the screen and
the design let's touch on a few starting
with what you'd notice first the all
glass and aluminum construction I opted
for gold in this case because it's all
that was available but I'm kind of glad
it worked out that way it's a very
unique look although it shares many
characteristics with its older sibling
the Galaxy at six
unlike the s6 however the s7 the battery
life is top-notch and quick charge for
almost immediate rejuvenation is nice to
have Gorilla Glass for surrounds the
entire device and minor contours on the
back edges seamlessly wrap around your
palms it's definitely a more comfortable
device to hold in your hand more
comfortable than an iPhone so that I can
say that without a doubt but expensive
being a bit more slippery the curved
back edges don't help that at all
and the fact that glass exists on the
back that's something else to keep in
mind also the curved aluminum edges here
they're nice it just you know it's a
very cohesive phone in that sense but
it's difficult to grab hold of it when
it's laying down so if it's just kind of
laying down this way or even laying down
the opposite way because the aluminum is
also curved and the back edges are
curved you're not left with much surface
area which to grab the phone so if you
lift it up and you're not actually
gripping it well then the phone could
just flip out from under you so keep
that in mind you don't want a shattered
well and regardless of whatever Gorilla
Glass is on here glass shatters so now
about the screen 1440p Super AMOLED
display drop-dead gorgeous covers a
whopping 72% of the front surface and
puts the iPhone 7th resolution to shame
even the iPhone 7 plus is resolution the
1080p still isn't enough reflects your
phone that's just my opinion AMOLED is
the way of the future and I wish other
smartphone manufacturers would jump on
board already LG and Apple I'm looking
at you to sec why is we're looking at a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core
processor that pulls in a single core
Geekbench for a score of around 1550
multi-core at 38 37 iPhone 7 810 fusion
processor is a heck of a lot faster
without a doubt but it's
something you'd likely notice much while
running something as lightweight as iOS
I explain that in more detail right here
overall though the s7 is fairly fluid a
few hiccups here in their TouchWiz is
bloated as it is I wish Samsung would
just ditch TouchWiz altogether go for
something more stock so run a custom
launcher to speed things along camera
quality on the smartphone is excellent
it's not something I'm too picky about
usually because I know that I have a
DSLR if I really need good looking for
growth so if you want professional-grade
photos idea solarz way to go I wouldn't
even consider smartphone for any of that
even an iPhone 7 but the iPhone 7
picture quality is probably the best out
there right now in terms of smartphone
cameras the Google pixel probably has a
second best camera from what I've seen
the oneplus 3 and few others are you
know close thirds the LG g5 is a decent
camera as well but it's it just comes
down to preference color reproduction
all that stuff will vary from phone to
phone the s7 I would say is like an 8
out of 10 if the iPhone sevens is a 10
out of 10 and that's just coming from
personal experience thus far the color
reproduction on the s7 is a bit
oversaturated that tends to be the case
with Samsung phones so not as
natural-looking as they would be on the
iPhone 7 but you get everything from 4k
at 30fps and 1080p 60fps to optical
image stabilization you even get pro
mode included in the stock camera app
which allows you to control everything
from your ISO to your aperture to your
exposure your autofocus all that is at
your disposal in the stock camera app in
the Samsung s7 which is really nice
I wish Apple would do the same for Apple
for Apple's iPhones you have to download
a third-party camera app in order to get
the same features so that's just
something else to keep in mind there I
obviously agree that the iPhone 7 has a
much better camera but it's not
something that I would fault the s7 for
not meeting expectations of it's still a
great camera it just isn't as good as
the iPhone 7 with 12 megapixel stills
and a whopping at 1.7 aperture a
5-megapixel selfie cam of the exact same
aperture this means great low-light
performance shots with the galaxy s7 so
I might give the low-light shot edge to
the s7
but everywhere else the iPhone 7 does
dominate something else what I think is
cool you
probably already notice the fact that
the on-screen display stays on all the
time so the display or your time your
battery life things like that in the day
you can control what's on there you can
even turn it off altogether if it's not
your kind of thing so you have all that
flexibility in there that means that
individual pixels can turn themselves
off completely it's the joy of AMOLED
which means you can save battery life
it's not like the whole screens on just
these few pixels you're seeing that are
white and it's not even a very bright
you know notification thing so it's not
going to keep you up at night if you
just set it on your nightstand or
something like that but the battery life
really isn't hindered by this and it's
just something that I think is really
cool
LG's done the same thing with their IPS
displays which is a lot harder to do
because IPS displays don't have that
ability to turn off individual pixels
they're lit from the back but this is
something I think it's very cool a
unique way of taking advantage of the
Super AMOLED display lastly I'd like to
touch on the fingerprint sensor it's not
as great as the iPhones but it's good
enough I really have to repress the HOME
key to unlock with phone and even when I
do it's only when I'm holding the phone
at an awkward angle kind of like this I
have it laying on desk so I never really
have to unlock it doing that
so in summary I must say a few things
that are facts and a few things that are
opinions so be warned you might not
agree with me on the opinion part but
here we go
this one looks better than an iPhone 7
it's built better than an iPhone 7
Corning Gorilla Glass 4 all the way
around the thing and it's also does
proof and waterproof so that's that's
another perk that I didn't mention
earlier for the s7 I think that's a way
better screen in the iPhone 7 battery
life is out on par with the iPhone 7 the
camera isn't as good as the iPhone 7 but
I'm not going to take away points from
the s7 because the cameras still great I
just just give bonus points to the
iPhone 7 operating system in my opinion
is better I've used both operating
systems for a while I'm the kind of guy
who prefers Android that's just how I am
and last but not least this phone has a
headphone jack that's how I'm an end
video got a headphone jack it
automatically wins right if you liked
this video be sure to give it a thumbs
up and give it a thumbs down if you feel
the complete office of every hate
everything about life be sure click
Subscribe but again stay tuned for I
don't even I haven't even prices pc out
but it seemed fairly expensive it's an
expensive editing flash gaming ITX pc
that we'll be building in the fractal
node - OH - and x99 PC that's oh we're
going to use an ITX X and an IPC from
asrock that you will see shortly stay
tuned for that
to be really fun just to kind of build
an experiment with this is sounds our
studio thanks for learning with
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
