powerful yet affordable PC into a case
not much larger than an Xbox one console
is no simple task but not to worry we've
done it for you here in the studio we've
also included step-by-step instructions
so if you're interested in building a PC
exactly like this one or even slightly
different you can follow along to the
instructions in this video as well as
the parts list that is in this video's
description so with that out of the way
let's go ahead and start building
so here's everything from the case to
the SSD with only one thing missing and
that's our custom CPU cooler the cryo
reg c7 and just didn't arrive on time
and will be installed at a later date
the total price of this build not
including the operating system but
including the c7 was just under eight
hundred US dollars
not bad for an ITX PC and if you're up
for it swapping our nvidia gtx 1060 with
a gtx 1070 will place you at the $1000
sweet spot so let's run through each
part first up the Intel Core i5 6400
with four physical cores six megabytes
of l3 cache and a frequency that will
raise manually via the base clock method
more on that here this CPU will be more
than enough for modern gaming in order
to base clock overclock we'll need to
z170 motherboard and this one from
gigabyte is also in the ITX form factor
we need it's equipped with several
peripheral ports a unique cooling system
a sufficient number of MOSFETs and
voltage regular modules and a plethora
of rear i/o ports including a USB type-c
port built in Wi-Fi 5.1 surround sound
and a wired LAN port for RAM we've gone
with eight gigabytes of kingston hyperx
ddr4 boasting a frequency of 21 33
megahertz and a relatively low caste
latency there kind of trade-offs these
modules will run in dual channel next up
is a very important piece of the puzzle
the graphics card we've opted for an
Asus GeForce GTX 1066 gigabyte variant
with a blower style cooler since our
case is fairly small this design should
keep warm air out but at the expense of
occasionally being louder and generally
under clocked compared to open air
cooler counterparts for storage a single
480 gigabyte PNY SSD does the trick for
us if you need anything more than this
consider a boot SSD and something like a
one terabyte hard drive for general
storage as for the case the fractal node
202 offers a sleek portable design and
durability thanks to its metal chassis
I'm not a fan of ITX cube cases and
other slim offerings are typically made
of plastic the note 202 follows the
conventional home theater format and
will easily blend in with your console
and or DVD player if you're still
sporting one of those and that's it
got it here we go pull out your CPU
being careful not to smear oils across
the bottom or top prepare the
motherboard by unhinging the lever to
the side of the socket and swing it open
don't touch these pins line up the
Golden Arrow on the chip with the white
arrow on the board and gently rest the
CPU in
then close the lid secure it under the
standoff and return the lever to its
original position this will take a bit
of force don't worry you're not going to
break anything as long as your CPU is
properly installed the black cover
should detach from the lid save this in
case you ever need to RMA your
motherboard pull back on the locks that
hold your RAM modules in place align the
notch on each with the indention in the
slot and secure each by applying force
like so until the lock re-engages on its
own we'll be using the stock cooler for
now as well as stock thermal paste I
know I know it's kind of the bare
minimum all you have to do here is push
each standoff through each of the four
holes surrounding the CPU socket ensure
that the cooler is fastened properly
before using it to move the motherboard
around once this is secured locate the
CPU fan header on the motherboard ours
was white align the four pins on the fan
cable with the header and connect it to
the board grab your motherboards i/o
shield that should be included in the
box and literally shove this into the
rectangular cutout at the rear of the
case I say shove because well that's
literally what you have to do before
merging the motherboard move any
impeding cables out of the way being
that this is an ITX case cable space in
particular is especially limited ensure
as well that all four standoffs are
exposed so that you can properly mount
the board oh and make sure you insert
its rear i/o side first you can use it
as a guide to align the board with the
standoffs
grab your included accessory box and
pull out the motherboard screws you can
check thread designations in your manual
or manually
the graphics for our PCIe bridge should
be installed next so start with a larger
piece and insert it into the single
large red slot on the motherboard pull
back on the hinge if necessary
install the shorter segment next we'll
be plugging our graphics card directly
into this extended slot remove the two
white cover slots near the rear of the
case save the screws and install the
graphics card by aligning the array of
pins with a shorter bridge you recently
installed the entire card should click
fully into the rear slots as well as the
PCIe extension bridge use the screws
from before to secure the graphics card
back into place
remove the SSD tray located in front of
the power supply unit it should slide
right out and mount the SSD to the
inside of this bracket use for
peripheral screws from the accessory bag
to keep it in place theoretically you
could just tape this somewhere inside of
the case since there are no moving parts
but this tray is a nice touch
grab a SATA cable that should be
included with your motherboard box and
connect one end into the shorter lead on
the SSD
the other end connects into a port that
looks like these right here if one is
labeled OS drive install it into that
SATA port grab the 24 pin lead from the
power supply and plug it into the 24 pin
header on the motherboard this is pretty
much common sense this powers your
motherboard and a few of its immediate
peripherals grab a SATA power lead like
this one right here and connect it to
the larger port on the SSD it should be
the only other vacant port on the drive
we made a mistake here and forgot to
route the PCIe cable beforehand so learn
from us but if you're following this
guide step-by-step while you're building
no biggie just gently run the cable
through the opening in the middle of the
chassis and underneath the graphics card
worst case just remove the card and then
do it that way this one requires a
single 6 pin connection
find the 4+4 cpu power lead and
connected to the eight pin header on the
motherboard near the rear i/o ports
don't worry we're almost finished here
find the HD audio cable running from the
case itself locate the only header on
the motherboard with a 5th 10 missing
unless it's marked obviously on the
motherboard and you guessed it connect
the thing I didn't film the USB 3.0
connection but do that as well it's
typically a thicker black cable or two
that runs into a unique header with a
single notch in the middle you really
can't miss it and now the final stretch
this part sucks undoubtedly check the
manual to properly evaluate where these
small cable leads should go the only
ones remaining in the case thankfully
there were only three leads for this one
a power switch power LED positive and
power led negative it was a tight
squeeze but we managed to make it work
with that out of the way it's time for
some final cable management there isn't
much we can do here but we can pull a
few of these cables away from the CPU
fan and closer toward the PSU everything
else is pretty much just improvised when
you're confident you've cleaned up
enough inside grab the top cover of the
note 202 slide it back on and secure it
from the bottom with the four K screws
you removed earlier to get inside
and guess what you've built a computer
you
so there you have it folks a very
powerful affordable and portable gaming
PC considerably smaller than the one
behind me and not much larger than an
Xbox one console the ps4 is it's kind of
in its own in its own Lake if you liked
this video be sure to give it a thumbs
up give it a thumbs down if you look up
a tapas atour have no idea what you're
doing here be sure to subscribe if you
haven't already to stay tuned for part
four the CPU core series I keep taunting
it because it's taking me a while but I
finally almost finished compiling all
the data into Excel
this is science studio thanks for
learning
