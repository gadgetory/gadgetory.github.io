studio and welcome to another review if
you missed our previous review of the LG
29 inch ultra wide IPS monitor be sure
to check that one out as well I have the
Acer 110 with me today and you've
probably seen me using it in previous
videos I picked it up on Black Friday or
more like Black Thursday for only 120
dollars you can pick these up not on
sale for around $199 so to be fair we'll
regard the price of this tablet as such
200 bucks
let's find out just how well it does
what it says it does so disclaimer there
are a lot of Acer one tablets out there
now apparently Acer has been doing this
for quite some time this model that
we'll review is a sirs newest take on
the one series
dubbed the 110 the 10 referring to the
size of its screen or maybe the tenth
revision of this series I don't know
maybe both starting with the outside the
aja 110 features a brushed metal appeal
either made of super hard plastic or an
aluminum alloy of sorts it definitely
feels premium the back of the device
reveals most of the metal work featuring
a brushed back plate the center of which
contains the textured Acer logo to the
south west and east are the integrated
stereo speakers the speakers themselves
are very trebly and lack any form of low
pass whatsoever even voices and videos
seem Hollow and pitchy have a listen for
yourself
north of the logo still on the back of
the tablet slash laptop hybrid is a 2.0
megapixel sensor and in case you were
wondering
it's literally written right next to the
camera both cameras the one here as well
as the one on the front are also subpar
lacking color depth and an adequate
sensor size obviously however both
should serve well enough for simple
Skype video chats and the occasional
selfie moving on to the sides of the
device we find nothing at all on the
right but a slew of inputs on the left
starting from the top we have a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack a micro HDMI
output port a micro SD card slot a micro
USB port and the charging port the
single microphone is also on the side on
the top side are a volume rocker
power button along with its respective
led which can turn either orange while
charging or blue when finished charging
the front of the device contains the
other 2.0 megapixel camera I should also
mention at this point neither a certain
nor best buy mention the video
capabilities of these two cameras while
they do take video I'd put them around
the 480p mark if they're 720p capable
they're being a bit shy the screen
covers much of the front as you might
expect and at 10.1 inches across and in
the WXGA 1280 by 800 pixel format you'll
find the screen to be well defined and
crisp with 160 pixels per inch now it is
only a TFT display so colors themselves
will look a bit washed out but the lack
of vibrancy is made up for by the
brightness of the display even in direct
sunlight the screen is legible and
discernible it is recessed from the
glass above it by a few millimeters but
this is only noticeable from an angle at
an arm's distance away the screen as a
whole will look like it belongs in a
pricier computer below the TFT is a
capacitive windows icon which can wake
the device and open the Start menu the
bottom of the device features two large
magnetic inserts for the attachable
keyboard as well as a nine pin connector
for keyboard feedback the included
keyboard is versatile and thin and
features the only full-size USB 2.0 port
on the entire device no USB 3.0 ports
exist obviously you'll have to have the
keyboard section connected to the screen
in order to use it transfer rates are
average of bests the USB 2.0 is outdated
to begin with but the 9-pin connector
seems to slow the transfer rate even
further the keyboard as a whole is
actually easy to remove and attach the
magnetic inserts 8 in this process
giving a full and satisfying engaged /
disengaged feeling every time the
touchpad on the detachable keyboard is
smooth metallic and feel and responsive
for the most part occasionally the
computer will fail to detect the
keyboards connection requiring a quick
removal and reinsertion this is more
than likely a software issue rather than
a hardware one touchpad sensitivity and
various gestures can be configured
within the OS two buttons hiding under
the bottom of the touchpad
right and left click responses and a two
finger scroll imitates the scrolling
wheel of a typical Mouse the upper
portion of the device can be mounted
either forward or backward to the
keyboard section and can be closed
completely the tablet software detects
when the keyboard has been removed or
attached and will disable or enable the
on-screen keyboard accordingly
although the upper portion of the
computer is the heavier portion the
keyboard does a fairly decent job of
keeping the device sitting upright on
flat surfaces take it to a better couch
however and the heavier screen often
wins the tug-of-war a solution in this
case would be to angle the screen more
vertically though this obviously has its
issues the keyboard keys are spaced well
and typing is unhindered for the most
part I had no problem swapping for a
full-sized keyboard to the chiclet
keyboard of the Acer and appreciated the
subtle dips in the keys when they were
pressed and in case you were wondering
for a device like this input lag was not
noticeable so let's work our way to the
inside of the tablet portion of the
computer driving things home is a
low-power Intel Atom are you ready for
this z3 7 3 5 F this variant of Intel's
bay trout lineup features a quad-core
64-bit architecture processor clocked at
a speed of 1.3 3 gigahertz with aided
help from 2 gigabytes of ddr3 laptop
grade RAM an important point here is
that the Acer 1 tens processor is 64-bit
but the windows operating system Windows
10 is only 32-bit this compatibility
flaw is due in part to the tablets UEFI
restrictions but in a computer like this
the architecture difference won't be
pivotal the storage capabilities of the
110 are definitely limited in scope it
boasts a 32 gigabyte flash memory module
acting more like a solid-state drive a
slow SSD however the microSD slot
supports up to 64 gigabyte cards for
additional storage the Atom processor is
no giant in Intel's lineup but performs
surprisingly well under load it handles
multiple web pages flawlessly produces a
mediocre but understandable Geekbench
32-bit score and uses its low power
demand to aid in prolonged battery life
I was even able to edit and render
movies using moviemaker on this thing
and speaking of battery life the
110 packs and 8400 milliamp lithium
polymer rechargeable battery capable of
lasting with moderate use for around six
to eight hours on a full charge I have
noticed that the computer will drain
itself considerably even while sleeping
so expect to recharge the computer on a
daily basis if you're the type of person
who simply closes a screen rather than
powers off the device entirely after
each use it was definitely something I
had to get used to background processes
within the OS are likely the issue in
this case and by the way a full charge
from 0 to 100% takes roughly five hours
Wi-Fi connectivity was satisfactory
picking up solid signals from a
considerable distance away though
occasionally the tablet would assume I
was connected via ethernet cable even
though no such connection option exists
anywhere on the device
a simple restart fixes the problem in my
case so let's wrap things up in my
opinion the Acer 110 is aimed at the
occasional or light user who wishes only
to web browse type of documents and take
a spin at minecraft don't get your hopes
up gaming is a struggle on this device
and you can tell that this tablet was
definitely not aimed with the PC Gamer
it becomes especially noticeable even in
Minecraft that the two and one relies
solely on integrated Intel HD graphics I
find it highly useful in the classroom
however or in the car or on a business
or leisure trip that doesn't require
heavy editing or anything of that sort
this is the ultimate two-in-one PC for
the average college student and when
paired with a hefty desktop will fill
most any void on the mobile side of the
techies busy schedule the lack of
various USB ports is honestly the only
drawback that quickly comes to mind
during use for price of $200 that is
expected to drop within the coming
months the Acer 110 gets a thumbs up
from us here in the studio but what do
you think let us know in the comments
below leave a thumbs up if you'd like to
see more tech reviews give us a thumbs
down if you thought this video was just
straight crap and let us know what you'd
like to see in the future this is
science studio thanks for learning with
this
