small that is let's try a strand of
human hair is about 100 micrometers
thick and that's about 14,000 times
wider than seven nanometers in fact with
this scale we could measure the
thickness of a single DNA strand
clocking in at around two and a half
nanometers some of the smallest effect
of transistors we've ever created we're
just a single phosphorous atom across
that leaves out the silicon aspect of it
but still and that's about 0.2
nanometers in diameter so much for the
end of Moore's law so we are literally
fabricating processors in the same scale
as us as human beings and here's why it
is so important
not just to clarify seven nanometers
does not describe the size of the
transistor in a CPU we discussed this in
more detail right here the length
actually describes the precision of the
fabrication how detailed you can get
think about it like I don't know the
size of a pixel smaller pixels take up
less real estate on a screen meaning you
can pack more of them into the same
amount of space the result is a higher
degree of detail more information per
frame basically and that's why fabs like
TSMC and GlobalFoundries and micron use
this notation perhaps above all else the
node shrinkage signifies a bump and
efficiency and that's what we'll discuss
first
so in short seven nanometer processors
are extremely efficient surprise
surprise Apple was the first to push a
seven nanometer processor to market
dubbed the a12 bionic you might have
heard of this before the iPhone 10s
boasts nearly seven billion transistors
in an 83 square millimeter surface area
that is smaller than like pinky nail
just ya visualize that
by contrast the Xbox one exports a
similar number seven billion or so and a
package significantly larger roughly 360
square millimeters this is because the
Xbox utilizes a 16 nanometer fab so the
node shrinkage alone allows us to cram
similar amounts of compute power into
much smaller packages that is obviously
one pearl another trait of a smaller
transistor is its lower capacitance
defined simply as the amount of
electrical energy a component can store
now in the case of CPUs transistors act
as switches and require threshold
voltages to both open and close smaller
transistors inherently have lower
threshold voltages since the gaps
between sources and sinks are smaller
right they're smaller transistors and
the energy to function effectively it's
does lower Advice ignition amount a
byproduct of this is frequency meaning
the gates themselves can open and close
faster if less energy is required to
build up in the process its overall this
increase in precision allows these
processors to save power and operate
faster which is a win win for the
consumer there are drawbacks including
leakage which has been a concern for the
past five or six years but we're
constantly coming up with innovative
ways to solve that problem another
benefit of smaller more precise CPU
architecture is space obviously remember
that 812 Bionic chip we just talked
about it's die covers less
a square centimeter of area meaning
Apple had plenty of additional space to
work with it means a bigger battery
means more RAM it means a larger GPU
more cache it really just depends on
what the manufacturer deems necessary
nvidia for example took the opportunity
with its 12 enemy to process to cram
additional compute tensor and RT cores
into that massive t you want a to die in
the cases of both the 2080 TI and titan
RTX we just call that like the Titan R
of course there are thermal limitations
associated with any electrical work done
but assuming you've got a beefy enough
cooling system the benefits of a smaller
architecture in this case are limitless
and allows companies like Nvidia to
experiment with innovative ideas and new
ways of solving complex problems but
with the seven nanometers fabrication
comes it's financial and technological
challenges another reason why their
entrance into the market is such a big
deal production cost scale rather
exponentially with no shrinkage that's
just relying on historical context there
and foundries like TSMC currently
supplying Apple Qualcomm and Nvidia
among others are feeling this strain
higher degrees of precision mean more
mistakes to put it lightly this is one
of the reasons why I expect the lower
tiers n2 chips in the case of AMD to be
extremely affordable if the yields per
core are lower and we expect to see C
X's per die and maybe up to 4 CC X's in
total then Zen 2 for poor CPU should be
an ample supply by default this is why
prices for higher core count chips don't
scale on a price per core basis in a
linear fashion
if the yields for an 8 core variant are
40% let's say and the yields for a 4
core variant are 80% then the 8 core
chip should cost well over twice the
price on a consumer side since these
failure rates cut in to AMD zone margins
Intel mind you is dealing with a very
similar failure rate with their in-house
fabs which is a reason why we keep
seeing 14 animator refreshes from them
not the only reason but it's a big one
so I hope this short little video at
least shed a little bit of light into
some of the reasons why the 7 nanometre
leaf is first of all so difficult and so
important in the industry I expect the
year 2020 will be a sweet time for PC
gamers and enthusiasts and it'll be a
great time to finally just appreciate
competition in the space I think we need
more entrants but I'll take whatever I
can get at
what are you guys thinking this was a
short little video I could have gone
into more detail but just bringing up
the whole 7 any of your conversation is
good because uh we're looking forward to
a lot in the next two or three years
like the video you know what to do
dislike it for the clean tops of feeling
or if you hate everything about life you

haven't already now I'll catch you in
the next one this is science studio
