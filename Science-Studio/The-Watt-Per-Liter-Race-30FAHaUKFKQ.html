sending us to Computex 2019 what's going
on everyone I am here at Silverstone
smooth at Nang gang exhibition hall for
Computex 2019 we're gonna talk about the
wat per liter race and why it's
important we don't talk much about that
especially when we do power supply
reviews usually you just read a wattage
let's say it's a this size and it's 700
watts right it does the job it's a
standard ATX size and that's that but
there are some important applications
for say SFX right and you guys have seen
us use sfx power supplies in the past
we've used them for many ITX builds you
have even some more nish form factors
like sfx l so this won't fit in a
standard sfx case so it's slightly
larger than that especially in terms of
width but it's not as large as ATX right
so this is where the watt per liter race
really starts to matter because certain
applications require small power
supplies but powerful power supplies and
being able to solve both of those issues
and a unit like this is extremely
difficult technically and very
impressive so take this one for example
a SX 750 750 watts and a small SFX form
factor like this and then let's say
you're going all-out you have two
systems and you want one power supply
you throw it all in the decathlon 2000
watt unit you guys see how many
connections are up there so you can see
like for example the 750 watt unit
coffee you want to get in close on this
one is that gonna focus for you looking
good alright so that's s FX 750 watt 945
watts per liter and the leader refers to
the size of the unit itself very small
and if you have a lot of power packed
into that obviously that ratio goes up
in this case here a 2000 watt unit it's
gonna have a watt per liter ratio of 861
and so that's obviously a little lower
than something like this but this is a
lot more technically difficult to do
again because you have all these small
components packed into a unit like this
that you have to keep properly cooled
for one and that can't cross over and
short each other out because that would
be really bad for your system and
probably other things in your house now
an application for something like this
I'm going to show you guys a case that
they've
working on over there that will actually
use a small form-factor power supply
like this high wattage but a server
application or an ass so let's go check
that out and this is a cs3 81 maybe not
the prettiest name you guys are gonna
like what you see on the inside of this
this is my definition a micro ATX case
and if I pop the lid here and see the
goodies inside two 120mm fan mounts here
on the back you actually put a 240-mile
a IO in this case you're wondering what
all of this is for obviously these are
for SSDs but these big trays here up
front are for I know how to that's right
oh here we go cool check that out one
two three four five six seven eight hot
swappable base for hard drives and
that's what's taking up the majority of
the space in this case the motherboard
obviously goes underneath that you're
gonna need a low-profile CPU cooler but
in a build like this you're probably not
gonna put a 9900 Kay let's be honest and
then how they get this to be so small
overall you're wondering where on earth
is a power supply yoke I'll come back in
here how deep the power supply in this
build if you just take a guess right now
where it is it ain't going there that's
where the graphics card goes now how
about underneath the hard drive nope
that's microwave Tex is gonna come all
the way to the front of the case
virtually maybe over here where is it
gonna fit just enough space above or to
the right of the motherboard 4 and SFX
power supply and when you have tons of
hard drives potentially an SLI configure
in here but one beefy graphics card if
you really wanted and a fairly
power-hungry CPU again if you wanted and
you can power that all by a higher power
SFX PSU if it's nice and snug on the
right side of this case this is one of
the few cases I've ever seen in the
micro ATX form factor that manages to
stay this small and pack this many hot
swap bays in it and that is due in large
part to the fact that they've been able
to implement a small form-factor power
supply a high wattage SFX power supply
into a case this size all right you guys
and we're gonna close with a couple
power supplies that don't have any fans
you guys saw this one before this is the
nightjar and we did we've actually
reviewed this in a dedicated video so no
fan in this SFX L form package is
slightly larger than standard SFX gonna
you know be a little longer sometimes a
little fatter so
won't fit and places where standard s
affects power supplies are designed to
sit you can see here we have another
fanless model this is an ATX version so
it's a lot bigger this will fit in most
cases out there and yeah no fan you can
literally see all those small board
components straight through the chassis
we have tried to get this in a couple of
clips you guys have been awesome and we
have next to go to gigabyte so we're
gonna start filming that one you're very
soon special thanks to silverstone for
really helping us out Tony especially
giving me the rundown of all the
components and I want to make sure that
we show you guys as much as we can this
year Computex 2019 thanks for watching
stay tuned for the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
