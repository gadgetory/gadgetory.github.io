CPUs it can be just a little difficult
to find true value in light of Verizon
right blue team options can look just a
bit expensive and premium consider this
you can buy a first gen Reisman v 1600
have a six core CPU with 12 threads for
under 140 bucks you want the Intel route
for that same budget you'd only be able
to afford a core i3 something like the
80 350 K which is only a 4 core CPU but
that's all changed with the launch of
this chip right here it says Intel's
Core i5 9400 F and it just might be the
best value gaming CPU on the market and
no this is not a late April Fool's joke
so let's run through some of the
specifications the core i5 94f is a 6
core 6 thread coffee-like cpu and tells
ninth gen stuff is very similar to 8th
gen and that core counts for the lower
chips stay essentially the same I threes
are hyper threaded four cores I 5 to 6
cores and I 7s are either hyper threaded
or non hyper threaded eight cores with
outer-box frequencies reaching 5
gigahertz but what then makes this
particular Core i5
special the answer is its price the CPU
as of April 2nd when I wrote this this
script for this video can be purchased
for a hundred and sixty bucks and with
it you also get a free coolermaster
Devastator 3 if that matters to you it's
little gaming mouse you can get if you
buy it on Newegg a nice added perk just
something extra and the 9400 def is a 65
watt hexa core processor with a 4-pull
and gigahertz turbo boost and until
obtain support but then what the heck
does the the after stand for we've never
seen an F before I can't remember
everything enough before I think this is
a new thing well yeah that's kind of the
catch you see the reason why these chips
are occasionally cheaper than their non
f counterparts is because these here
lack integrated graphics this means
you'll need a discreet graphics card in
your system in order to have a picture
displayed on screen this is the case
even if the motherboard in questions
sports display out so don't be fooled by
that now is this a big deal I mean not
really most of us are
boarding discrete graphics and they're
usually a lot better than IGP so that's
kind of the incentive they're almost all
rice and CPUs by the way also like I GPS
so if that's your reason for avoiding
the 90 400 F you should probably stick
to a risin apu or non F Intel ski when
Intel first announced these things
earlier this year they admittedly didn't
look too hot to their kind they
basically they were trying to sell these
for the same price as their non f
counterparts what we'd expect the non F
chips to be priced at so a core i5 this
would be equipments like an 8400 I
wouldn't pay a dime over 200 bucks for
it probably around a hundred 170 to 180
USD in the in the States that's what I'd
expect to pay but they were trying to
sell the F SKU for the same price as
what we'd expect that non FC to go for
and I wasn't a big fan of that but they
came down in price recently again 160
bucks for this I think a $20 discount
isn't decent for somebody that's already
got his free graphics card already which
is again probably most of us and then on
top of that you can make some really
great gaming performance out of this
thing as we'll show you in a few minutes
and look the whole pricing issue with
the excuse in the beginning was probably
response to Intel's own issues with
supply and its current 14 nanometer
process now that chipsets and CPUs are
both being manufactured in the same node
the supply chain is bottleneck that's a
big reason why prices for Intel CPUs in
general aren't as hot competitive as
arise ins but every now and then a gem
like this one pops up and for a decent
price like 160 bucks for a core i5 that
I mean a six core i5 it's pretty darn
good and all honesty for the 90 400 F
I'd say it's probably the best value
gaming CPU on the market just gaming
don't take my words out of context if
you are just buying a CPU to game with
you want to buy the core i5 9400 at 160
bucks just take my word for it actually
you know what don't take my word for it
I'll show you so here is what I did I
put together an Intel platform using 16
gigs of DDR for a GTX 1660 TI graphics
could I feel like you'd want to pair
with the CPU and ABI 360 motherboard
remember this is an on case Q so we
really don't need an overclocking
motherboards like a Z
Cirie's chipset now for the sake of
comparison I put together a similarly
priced Rison platform using a B 450
motherboard the same 16 gigs of ram and
arisin v 2600 the AMD cpu has invented
with multi-threading but intel's clock
for clock edge and compute tasks and to
an extent software optimization keep it
in the ring again as you'll see shortly
one thing to note I am manually
overclocked in the 2600 of 4 gigahertz
across all cores
I don't care Intel fanboys I'm doing it
because I can that's the point right you
can with these rice and chips you can't
with some Intel SKUs that's not our
fault that's Intel's fault they have to
suffer the consequences so I'm gonna
give every advantage I can to the AMD
CPU including the overclock and also
memory memory frequency because we were
able to overclock our ddr4 with the B
450 I'm using here this is the tough B
450 gaming plus from a soos that I'm
using here and that allowed me to
overclock memory to 3,000 megahertz 3200
was unstable as getting blue screens
quite randomly and frequently and so I
drop things down to 3,000 megahertz and
it was smooth as butter
now with the B 360 motherboard 2666 was
as high as I could go that goes without
saying we could attain a higher clock
with a Z or H series chipset if we
wanted but we'd be cutting into our
budget and it would really make no sense
again to pair either of those with a
cheap CPU relatively speaking
additionally Intel chips aren't hindered
by a reduction in RAM frequency anywhere
near to the extent which horizon chips
are so it isn't like we're hurting the
94 death very much and all I had to do
in order to get this be 360 board to
work with a 90 400 F was flash and
updated bios with an older coffee leg
skew also a quick reference to the
graphics card I chose the 1660 ti again
because I felt it was a balanced card
for these CPUs I don't expect anyone to
not saying that no one does but I just
wouldn't recommend you pair at 20 atti
with something like a core i5 90 400 F
just to me doesn't make any sense
same goes for the Rison v 2600 although
I think in that case it's a little more
justified just the test wouldn't be
indicative of like real-world
performance and so I ensure that the
platforms that I was using were as
balanced as possible especially given
the fact that we're testing the 1080p
resolution as well and I think the 1660
Ti is
perfect for that so here are some
numbers in Cinebench are twenty not are
fifteen but are twenty the i-59 400 FS
scored a 23 18 CB that's not a bad for
six locked cores the rise of five 2600
though takes the cake with a strong 27
36 it's what we should expect from this
fab with simultaneous multithreading
tucked in and it isn't up for debate I
mean if we ran similar synthetic
benchmarks we'd find that the 2600 is by
far the better multitasker but what if
we throw a synthetic test that leverages
both discrete GPU and CPU horsepower
most games are going to utilize every
core that you throw at it times pi will
though so this is again a bit of an edge
for the 2600 so in 3d more time spies at
dx12 benchmark that 90 400 F elusive by
a mere 91 points 6070 vs. 6161 the
reason for the blue team loss fewer
threads basically is what it comes down
to again in applications that properly
leverage more than say four or six cores
the rise in platform reigns supreme and
the value Department I know it sounds
cliche at this point but it's important
that we stress the differences and
reveal all strengths and weaknesses of
both platforms so you can make the most
informed purchase decision that is after
all why this video exists let's move on
to a few games now first up as always is
GTA 5 this one has it's a bit of an
Intel bias and it shows across the board
113 FPS on average for the blue team and
118 for the red team
both gaming experiences were
satisfactory mind you I mean you
probably couldn't distinguish the two
unless you knew that one was ahead of
the other beforehand but when it comes
to the fine details the Intel platform
boasts a bit more wiggle room for the
tweaking of in-game settings so you
could possibly make your game look a bit
better at the expense of losing a few
frames and you'd still get the
performance that you get if you just
chose an AMD CPU to begin with our
lowest 1% and 0.1% of frames by the way
reveal similar stories next up shadow of
the Tomb Raider this one should close
the gap a bit more or less due to the
fact the game is a resource hog to say
the least 68 FPS on average with a 2676
4890 400 F one thing to note here the
AMD CPU surprisingly falls short in the
lowest point 1% frame suggesting a fair
degree of stutter throughout playback
it's something you would notice if you
were just playing
this game I don't know and in the real
world that's kind of the point of all of
this
now the next game I tested was Resident
Evil 2 which was actually bundled with
some AMD graphics cards so we should
expect maybe an AMD edge here and know
it's a CPU versus a GPU but still in
fact if you've looked at this metric
alone
you'd think performance between the two
was identical it's a hundred and thirty
six FPS versus 136 I kid you not in
multiple runs of this the exact same
scores however our lowest 1% of frames
reveals an 8 FPS gap that's over a 10%
reduction from Intel to AMD and the
story worsens for the lowest point 1% of
frames where the gap widens to above 20%
and before you jump on me for
inconsistent testing the exact same
routines were followed the exact same
pass I reinstalled Windows in every
single program in the same day in order
to get totally untouched you know
perfectly clean benchmarks of each
platform ok I used the exact same hard
drive right so that was where I stored
all my Steam games but I completely
wiped the end to dry that I used for the
boot drive between these tests because
you don't want to take an intel SSD and
then slap it into an AMD system and then
have the windows drivers can update
themselves you never really get a true
experience one-to-one there's always
gonna be some conflict on the software
level that prevents the the new system
from really performing at its best so
it's important that you wipe the OS
completely to have that clean slate and
the next game I tested was f1 2017 which
I did more or less for the sake of
consistency this benchmark is pretty
much indicative of what you should
expect in-game this actually favors
single core performance which intel
still dominates at a lackluster sub 4
gigahertz all core turbo boost 144 FPS
on average for the core i5 135 for the
r5 2600 am I surprised now not really
though I am a bit stunned by the blue
team's ability to keep 1% and 0.1% lows
well above its competitors 77 fps verse
62 the lowest point 1% of frames is a
huge Delta in my opinion and amounts to
a clear and distinguishable disadvantage
for the 2600 and the gamer using that
CPU in this game but with all that said
I want to stress that a lot of this
comes down to what you do on your
machine and that's why I'm not gonna
throw out a huge blanket statement like
I did in this video right here although
I was right look the truth is the 9400 f
is good it's it's really good especially
for 160 USD that's my opinion no one's
paying me to say that I literally just
asked and tell to send this because I
wanted to test it I thought it would be
a good competitor in the gaming space
and it is I mean III was kind of right
about that but I could have been wrong
and if I was wrong and the rise in 5/6
2600 or even the 1600 was better than
this in games then my conclusion would
be the opposite I'd say doesn't look
like the core i5s are keeping up anymore
in 2019 with most games granted I didn't
test a whole you know library of Steam
games I know that there are some
variants and depending on the game she
play some might favor the AMD CP more I
understand that I'm just saying of the 4
or 5 games that I just happen to test in
my own Steam library every single one of
them gave the victory to the core i5 I
mean is that really a surprise though
like we all kind of knew that Intel CPUs
were better for gaming but that's just
it who just games anymore you usually
you stream or you do something else with
it so I really only recommend the CPU
for those who game what I pay more than
hundred 60 bucks for it not really why
would you pay the same price for a CPU
without an AI GP that you could for one
with an AI GP and that's really the only
Achilles heel in the situation you have
no IDE P will it affect gamers nope not
most of them as long as you have a
discrete graphics card you won't even
notice you could say the same for the
rise in CPU alright the 2600 doesn't
have an AI GP either but a big advantage
of Intel in the content creation
department normally is the fact that
it's IGP allows for quick sync and quick
sync software encoding which basically
accelerates render tasks and things of
the sort it actually is a really big
help from a content gracious standpoint
especially in Premiere Pro and that's
why I kept coming back to Intel for my
personal machine I would switch to Rison
and come back because render times are
significantly faster when both the IGP
and discrete graphics are allowed to
work together but apart from that the
only other downside is streaming it's a
unique topic perhaps a bit niche though
in 2019 a lot of people are streaming
and so if that's a goal of yours in 2019
my recommendation is not the CPU it's
the rise in 520 600 which is actually
sitting in that box
right there it just makes more sense for
someone that legitimately multitasks
however one could argue that using the
Nvidia encoder with something like a
r-tx 20 60 or 2070 would offset any
cpu-bound scenario gaming ships like the
90 400 F the breathing room they need to
dominate the gaming space as they've
done for several years so it really
depends on your settings in steam excuse
me not Steam but in OBS or whatever
streaming platform you use so if you're
an all-around gamer then and that's all
you focus on I want to stress that's all
you do you just play video games
I recommend this CPU honestly I know
that a thousand dollar budgets a bit
high but if you could fit this into your
budget and you're not going to overkill
I think this is a great buy if you pair
this with even a twenty eighty and
twenty atti this is gonna pull its
weight in most cases because most games
are still barely if at all utilizing six
cores I know that sounds weird but it's
true I mean we have the huge core push
from AMD and that's kind of pushing in
til do the same but just because your
system has eight cores and 16 threads
doesn't mean you're using the full
potential of your CPU in fact I would
argue most people are not even if
they're on rise in seven CPUs or heck
for that matter thread ripper or core i
nines like the 79 80 X EE that's 7999
ATX II most people aren't utilizing all
of those threads if they are good for
them they bought the right CPU if you're
doing some programming some coding that
requires the use of 32 threads 64
threads whatever that's great but I
would say most people aren't and the
sweet spot in my opinion is between 6
and 12 threads I think that 2600 is a
really great value as well but it
depends on what you're doing obviously
so with that I will say I'm not sure how
much longer the sale at 160 bucks will
last for the 90 400 F that's not me
trying to push you to buy it but if you
do want to buy it I encourage you to use
our affiliate link down below I
appreciate that if you do we get small
kickback it's like 2/3 percent but it
goes a long way for a few people do it
in the end it really all just comes down
to what you see yourself doing with your
machine both platforms are great I'm not
trying to knock on AMD you guys don't
need to you know annihilate me in the
comments section I'm just saying if you
are strictly gaming then the 9400 f is a
very solid contender
didn't see myself saying that in 2019
but Intel actually priceless thing semi
competitively at 160 bucks they are
definitely targeting the risin 5 line up
at that price and again all you're doing
is gaming it's worth a shot
I mean if you're an AMD fanboy I'm not
gonna be able convince you either way
if you're an Intel fanboy I'm not going
to convince you either way either you're
gonna buy this you're gonna buy
something even better than this from the
blue team it's just important you guys
keep an open mind it really is you know
when I first got into this I always
thought Intel as the superior platform I
honestly did because at the time the
they had the best CPUs we were stuck
with bulldozer and pile drive
architectures you know visera for six
seven years with AMD and intel was
coming out with incremental updates I'll
give them that I mean especially
recently they've just been stretching
that 14 nanometer node for as long as
they can but you know when Haswell came
out and then skylake it was actually a
very compelling platform and if you had
the money you bought Intel because you
could because you knew it was better but
today there are so many different use
case scenarios for AMD and Intel CPUs
competition is beautiful I love it I
just love giving both sides an
opportunity to speak their mind and
that's why I tested this CP it's why I
asked until descendants because I
thought it had a really good chance at
outshining the rise in v platform the
rise of five CPUs rather in games in the
games that I tested that was the case
I'm not speaking for all games but the
ones I have no test it definitely held
its own and outperformed the 2600 which
is priced almost equally to the 9400
