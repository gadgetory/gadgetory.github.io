twelve seconds later
if you're sick of seeing the same

installed Windows 10 on your machine you
can shell out a little over ten bucks

one's going to be interesting I want to
build a PC that uses no fans at all that
includes fans and the case fans in the
power supply of fans and the graphics
card fans for the CPU I want no fans
straight up I want it to be a dead
silent system or confirm that with our
sound meter and we're also going to be
running through the parts and my
justification for choosing the parts
that I am choosing there are a few
graphics cards on the market that do not
utilize fans but I don't have any of
those on hand and they're fairly rare
difficult to get my hands on especially
here in the states so I'm going to try
my best to mod a card that I have on
hand and just remove the fans or just
turn them off down clock the graphics
card and still be able to play some
lighter 1080p titles
maybe csgo maybe some dota 2 if we can
squeeze out something like fortnight
that would be great
but I'm keeping an open mind because
we're gonna have to down clock the
graphics card a lot if we want to get
rid of fans so we'll experiment all that
in this video there's no guarantee of
success but we can start off with parts
that we know will work well without fans
and the first place to start is the
power supply so this is a night jar nj4
50 we reviewed it and dedicated video
right here from silverstone and it
utilizes no fans it's in the SFX elf
form factor which is also pretty
impressive so it's a smaller profile
than standard ATX power supplies and
again dead silent there's no internal
parts that move so it's a good place to
begin now as for the CPU I was debating
whether or not I wanted to use Intel or
AMD obviously they're kind of the only
two choices at my disposal and the 2600
really struck home for me because this
is such a low TDP CPU why something like
65 watts for this thing it does mean
we're going to need that
skree GPU obviously but that was the
plan all along and we can actually even
down clock this a bit thanks to the
unlock multiplier pretty much every AMD
chip out there can have an unlock
multiplier that is nice but I'll have to
pay a case Q tax like you would for
Intel and that's going to give us some
breathing room so if we do have to down
clock which will probably have to
depending on the CPU cooler we use we
should you know have some breathing room
I think if we go to around 3 gigahertz
maybe a little below that we can run a
beefy air cooler without a fan and this
should be fine as for RAM it doesn't
really matter what we go with although
you might be slightly concerned about
the LEDs overheating modules especially
when we have no active cooling or any
fan of any sort in the case
we'll check temps but I think these APIs
are Knox modules are gonna be fine and
they look really good at that no
scrolling through red and I came across
this 3d Center or graph it shows
performance per watt it's kind of a
ratio between the amount of power that a
graphics card consumes and the relative
performance of the card in question so
you can see that Nvidia pretty much
dominates this chart and we're hoping
Navi changes that soon but for now we're
gonna have to go with an Nvidia card and
we've kind of had no choice but picks
one of the higher ones here so the 1660
ti seems to be one of the better cards
in terms of performance per watt so I
think we're gonna go with that one we
have one from gigabyte I'm gonna strip
the fans off of the shroud and see how
far we need to down clock it in order to
get it stable without a fan I don't know
I think this is a good place to start if
the 1660 ti doesn't work then maybe the
1070 which is a really good card I
wouldn't want to go as far back as
Maxwell though because Maxwell was
pretty power-hungry relatively speaking
I was one of the big advantages of
Pascal at the time one of the reasons
why I really liked that architecture now
if you will excuse the mess in here you
can see we have a lot of cards to play
with but I'm again pretty sure we're
gonna want to stick with something like
a sixteen sixty or a sixteen sixty ti
the ti had the better price to
performance ratio in the chart so I
think we're gonna go with this although
a concern that I have sorry about the
autofocus and it's not gonna be very
good with this a 7s2 we have a yeah just
a two fan card here so it's a smaller
cooler
and that's part of my concern with this
if we have to drop the clocks too much
to get this stable without fans running
then we'll try the 1660 which is a
triple fan card I have in there and it's
it's just a bigger heatsink so more more
contact with the air more surface area
and that should allow more heat to
passively radiate so what we'll find out
no what do you think Pepsi you think we
can think we can pull it off I don't
know if she's uh I'm she's gonna
investigate you're gonna check it out
you think we can do it Pepsi think we
can do it yeah I'm gonna have to get
back to you on that one
now lastly the cooler I don't want to
use an h7 even though this is acquired
Lumi and we got four heat pipes this
time around I don't think this is what
we want to use I think we need something
a little bigger than a dark rock for
even that the dark Rock TF looks pretty
cool I'm just I'm 220 watts what's just
200 watts yeah we could go with the dark
rock TF and just kind of wing it and
we'll see how it goes the dark rock pro
4 would be the ideal cooler I'm not sure
where I put that I know I had one of
those around here somewhere but I put
most of my air coolers here so yeah
we'll just go with the TF for now and
again we'll see how it fares I expect
we'll have to do a bit of adjusting as
we go along because I have not tested
any of this prior to filming so yeah you
guys get to come along for the ride
all right so we've got this monstrosity
built and it is entirely fameless' no
case fans no CPU fan no graphics card
fans I actually took those out even
though I could have just disabled them
I'm not sure if that would affect the
temperatures at all but to make it truly
fanless it can't have fans that's why I
remove them and then also the power
supply of course has no fan so this
system when we power it on should be
like almost dead silent there's other
than maybe some minor coil wine from
inductors and whatnot this should be
almost totally silent so what I'm gonna
do is plug in some fans and just kind of
like let them hang so that we can
install windows on this machine because
I don't want it to crap out on me in the
wind in the middle of the installation
that would be pretty bad so I'm just to
be safe gonna do that of course I can't
like manually down clock the graphics
card without booting into Windows first
so I have to install the OS beforehand
the CPU though I'm going to go ahead and
clock down to probably and I don't know
how low I can go with this board
probably around two-and-a-half gigahertz
or so across all course and really under
volt this thing just to keep temps in
check while we install the operating
system all right let's go ahead and
power it on see I've got two fans here
once the graphics card just to keep that
one fairly cool and then one just kind
of hang here for the CPU again very
temporary I just want this thing to post
yeah probably should watch that okay the
lowest I can get this multiplier to go
is 28 and actually see if I can tamper
with the base clock because I don't know
if 28 is gonna be low enough see if
either CPU voltage that's offset mode I
would leave it on auto for now because I
don't really want to find with the
minimum voltages for this frequency
we'll just see we'll steal a temperature
spare and we'll go ahead and boot into
our UEFI sandesh partition alright so
what I've done is dropped the power
limit down to 58% that's as low as I can
go so 58% of the 100 percent power
allocation that's just stock out of the
box
I left the temperature limit up you can
on link these two typically when they're
linked you'll see they'll scale together
so I unlinked them and lower the power
limit as low as I could go and then I
left the temperature limit up to will
just say 85 it's pretty high but I don't
think we're if we do hit that
temperature I mean there's not much more
we can do core clocks dropped by 500
megahertz
I've also dropped the memory clocks to a
minus 500 as well and obviously no fan
speed because we don't have fans
installed a few moments later yeah I
don't think I want to let this run for
much longer if I close this panel off it
would be much much worse the good thing
is though and we'll talk about this
later
it's a dead silent system so do you
really even need a left panel that's
kind of I mean to block dust sure but
Dustin's gonna make its way in no matter
what so in the case of a silent totally
soundless system with no moving parts
having the left panel off really isn't
going to hurt you much okay so I think I
fixed the CPU throttling issue you can
see actually now I'm stressing the CPU
the FPU and the cache and temperatures
are pretty much flatlined which is
pretty incredible I thought not surely
it would still continue to rise just at
a slower pace so what I did was I
disabled the core performance boost
which is just what Asus calls they're
like essentially like multi-core
enhancement it doesn't allow the CPU to
turbo past my set clock speed in the
BIOS so you can see now if we go to
clocks all the cores are locked to just
under 30 20 100 megahertz so 2794 here
for all six of those cores and that's
keeping temperatures significantly lower
actually only just recently did our CPU
cross that 59 degree threshold so you
can see it's been running for about two
minutes now at this point two minutes
into the test beforehand we were running
at around 80 to 90 degrees Celsius so
this is a massive improvement
this should fix the CP side of things at
least long term for a lot of games but
we're still gonna have issues with the
GPU so let's test out csgo see how that
does twelve seconds later holy crap this
card is hot this is like dangerously hot
and the entire PCB is this way like the
connections right here the PCIe dock is
burning up I'm kind of concerned about
this I shouldn't have shouldn't have
been allowed to have gotten that hot but
whatever for science we at least know
that that's not gonna work the graphics
card was the thing being stressed the
most and it pegged itself at around 90
to 92 degrees Celsius before I decided
to turn it off because that's just way
too hot for 1660 or ti so I didi you
uninstalled that's what just happened
here systems shutting down we're gonna
try out a method that crackling ice from
Twitter recommended he said why don't
you use an AMD graphics card because you
can use Whatman you can really lower
frequencies in Whatman to a much greater
extent that you can't then you can in
MSI Afterburner
so I was like okay well at first they
didn't really make sense to me but now
it does because clearly I can't I can't
lower temps any more than that so we're
going to I'm not sure which one we're
gonna go with I think we're gonna do an
rx 580 and I think what I'm also going
to do is rip the entire shroud off and
just see if I can have like the bare PCB
with the heatsink
that way maybe you can get rid of more
of the heat passively yeah let's do
let's do the five ATS and we'll just
we'll just try one of them see how it
works
and alright so this is the RX 580 pretty
bare no backplate so I'm not sure if the
backplate would help or hurt in this
case but whatever there's not one here
and then bare heatsink down below again
not sure if it
help her hurt but I think it's gonna
help especially for the heatsink because
there's not going to be as much blocking
that passive heat you know radiation so
we'll see how it goes again I expect
we'll have a slightly we'll have
slightly better luck with this I really
hope so if we don't then this project is
a bust because I have no other car
that's this low-power that's still
powerful enough to play games in 1080p
so yeah we'll we'll try it out okay so
we're in global Walkman now and you'll
see very quickly why I think this is a
good idea I think crackling ice was onto
something you can lower the frequency by
upwards of 50 percent you can see this
would be pretty terrible if we left it
like this what I'm going to do is keep
it around 40 percent and I'm gonna lock
the voltage to 800 millivolts max I
think that'll be enough if it's not then
we'll go back and change it might
actually be too much now that I'm
looking at it
dumare oh well it didn't work and I'm
sure you can figure out why the gravit
skirt continued to reach 90 91 92 93
degrees Celsius in fact with our AMD
graphics card because it couldn't throw
it down anymore the system just shut off
whenever it got too hot in an effort to
save the graphics card which is actually
a good thing so I didn't want to let you
guys just kind of I don't know hang
there without actually seeing a fanless
build work but this system here is still
fanless it's just not as powerful as I
would have liked for it to have been so
this is a GT I think it's 7:30 10:30 I
think it's a 730 GT 7:30 anyway it's a
pretty garbage gaming graphics card it's
just more for people who don't have a
GPS and who still just want to do like
regular office work and stuff this
graphics card fine for that but I
wouldn't recommend gaming on this thing
here we've shown you why in previous
videos there are several ways I could
have done this I could have again shoved
like a really expensive high-end r-tx
2080 or 2080 ti into here and down clock
the crap out of that because there's
already run pretty cool out of the box
and maybe that would have worked without
fancy I have no idea but what I went
into this thinking was that kind of the
the better performance per watt cards
would be the ones to use here and those
still did not I mean we were running at
300 megahertz on the rx 580 and it's
still throttled it's still shut down the
entire system because it reached over 90
degrees Celsius
having at least one fan is like it's a
it's a game-changer it really is I would
plug in one fan up top here and just
kind of hold it over both and
temperatures dropped dramatically just
one fan getting some heat to be removed
it's all fans do they displace air they
move heat away from the source that's
the point that's why we have these big
heat sinks here right to absorb all that
heat and then to radiate that heater
convect that heat and so having a fan
there does a huge chunk of that job and
if you don't have a fan to remove the
heat and it just builds up and once the
heatsink becomes heat soaked then the
remainder of the heat comes back into
the CPU or the cheap view at which point
it just content
to get hotter and hotter and hotter and
that's what we saw in this video through
the multiple runs so yeah I feel kind of
bad that this is the system you guys are
stuck with but it's the best I could do
it's a famous graphic chart it emits a
low power card it's how it's supposed to
run and the CPU is massively underclock
but it was still getting the job done
and when you have six cores your
disposal it's okay if you drop some of
those frequencies it's gonna hurt you in
game but you're gonna be able to still
run your day-to-day programs and not
seek too big of a hit so is it worth it
absolutely not in my opinion stuffing
just one fan in here turning the RPM
down so low that you can barely affect
it anyway with that left panel on is is
way better than choosing to go for a
downright passive system right we're no
fans are included and some of you were
asking about why I wasn't using like the
Exelero fanless whatever graphics card
heatsink and there's like CPU coolers
out there that are designed to be
fameless I will say though you should
think about this they still expect you
to use fans in your case they spill they
still expect you to have case fans so
just because the the cooler itself is
designed to be fanless it does not mean
that that the manufacturers expect you
to use no fans at all in your system so
it would defeat the purpose ultimately
to buy a fanless CPU cooler but then it
still have fans in your case in my
opinion and that's why I've never really
advocated fanless designs just to me it
just doesn't make any sense because
you're gonna need a fan somewhere anyway
if I could pull it off with this
hardware I knew I could pull it off with
the more expensive stuff that's designed
to run familis and that was the point so
for those of you who are gonna be
commenting why didn't you do this why
didn't you use this part I'm gonna time
stamp this section of the video I'm sure
they'll be plenty of your doing next
month most of you don't watch the end of
the video so anyway thanks for watching
you guys especially if you did watch to
the end of the video I appreciate that
we had a lot of fun with this one but it
ultimately didn't end up working and
that's okay that's part of the
experiment you kind of have to take the
risk and assume the worst and in this
case we didn't get what we wanted that
that's alright we know why we know that
the graphics card in particular was
holding us back we tried AMD and NVIDIA
graphics cards and we still had a
similar results so that kind of sucks
that card is very low if you guys liked
the video a thumbs up you know what to
do click the red subscribe button try to
become a member if you want to be fancy
gets special dedicated live streams
things
that sort and we'll catch you in the
next one this is science studio and
