this time for 69 bucks you get this
right here it's a mid-sized Tower packed
with RGB integration it's pretty much a
staple at this point for fantex cases
going back as far as what I can remember
the P 400 the original P 400 and apart
from just the the average kind of like
build right being that it's a mid Tower
there are plenty of mid towers that
compete with this case I think that the
biggest selling point is going to be
obviously the price at 69 USD it's a
heck of a bargain it's being sold right
now on new egg for us buyers but I'm not
sure about Amazon yet
but they'll be linked to the description
if you're interested but for now I wanna
tell you what I think about it because I
help Lisa build in this case this exact
build this is our i-5 8400 gtx 980ti
build you can check out the video
somewhere on the side of the screen but
I'm going to tell you why I think it's a
heck of a bargain talk about some of the
pros and cons associated with the price
what you're kind of forgoing right when
you choose to buy something that's sub
$100 in this category and then tell you
what I like the most about it so this is
the van tax P 350 X here we go are you
in need of a sexy new set of cables for
your next computer build look no further
than the cable mod configurator where
you can design custom sleeved cables
spec to your PSU of choice with exact
lengths colour combinations and combs in
the new Pro Series lineup which is a
huge step up over the previous stuff
check the link in the video description
and start building to day starting first
with overall build quality the chassis
is comprised of steel and you will find
a tempered glass panel this fans just
far enough down to top off the basement
here so the basement section of this
case on the left side has its own
dedicated panel that kind of protrudes
from the rest of the chassis and that
sinks flush with the tempered glass that
rests above it so similar to how fantex
handled this with their p 300 and their
p 350 X kind of takes it to the next
level
I think that's a bit longer than a P 300
it's just slightly shorter in terms of
height than their P 400 series so this
chassis boasts seven PCIe slots at the
rear that's good for give or take two
graphics cards with maybe an extra
peripheral in there like a cap
your card what have you you do have a
one 120mm fan mount at the rear that is
actually where I move the stock fans you
only get one stock fan of this case and
it's not very great it's kind of a
generic one of the mill fan though it
does not have like a you know molex
connectors it's not that old it's not
too loud I mean as long as you turn the
thing down it's just a three pin fan if
you control it in your BIOS then you're
gonna be perfectly fine with just using
this is like an exhaust fan which is
typically what I do with these chief
fans that manufactures including their
cases again only one 120mph fan included
with this chassis and that was obviously
a cost-saving measure for fan tax there
are up to two 140 mm fan mounts up top
and that's pretty much where I'm going
to call it I'm not gonna say that you
could fit a rat up here because well
there's not much space vertically above
the graphics card there's maybe about an
inch and a half and that's good for just
fans you could put just a radiator up
here but it would be a passive radiator
so you wouldn't have any fans linked to
that and I say that because you're gonna
have your vrm mosfet he sings from your
motherboard impeding your ability to
mount an a IO combo up there and also
RAM clearance would be a severe issue so
you can see here we only have maybe 3/4
of an inch or so worth of clearance
between the tips of our ram which these
are pretty ostentatious modules these
are from Team Group the Nighthawk white
RGB modules between those modules and
the fan again about three quarters of an
inch so yeah that's not wide enough for
an a IO combo fan rad combo of any sort
so I would say maybe just exhaust fans
up top and that's it you do get a dust
filter up top by the way so if you want
to run these as intakes for whatever
reason you can do that not worry too
much about dust flooding your case and
toward the front you'll find sports for
up to a 280 mil a I Oh combo and I'm
saying just 280 because there is no
cutout in the basement which means that
this chassis does not support 360 ml fan
ride combos of any sort you can't fit a
360 more red anywhere in this chassis so
limited just to 280 upfront I wouldn't
even call it a 240 up top because
there's just really no vertical space
for that and then you could probably
squeeze out of 120 money I owe at the
rear although we'd be really cutting it
close I would recommend putting
everything that you can a i/o wise up
front and you can see we have plenty of
space still between our gtx 980ti gaming
from gigabyte and the AIO at least the
fan red combo section
so if you want to run an extended
graphics card something that's really
long even like a dual GPU card you could
certainly do that in this case you do
have that link clearance you could
certainly mod this case just a little
bit with a bracket like this or you can
use the cable mod bracket which doesn't
require any cutting at the rear which is
actually what I would recommend at this
point and you could get a similar look
to what we've done here but I invite you
to go check out their video I pointed to
earlier if you want to copy this build
exactly how we did it you can see how we
got it all fit in here but there is a
cutout also for graphics card VGA power
cables to run from the basement from
underneath the basement it's a small
cutout you could probably fit an 8 pin
through here I mean if you want to do to
8 pins you're gonna kind of squeeze the
cables at the base line I wish fantex
had widened this hole just a little bit
otherwise I am glad to see one their
cable management elsewhere in the
chassis though is actually really good
and part of the reason why that's the
case is because there is an indention
here again next to the motherboard or
where the motherboard would be and it
just gives you extra volume places to
stuff those cables that you otherwise
I'd have to run right underneath your
basement kind of in your hard drive bays
that tends to be where I stow extra
extra cables I do have extensions
running so there's already extra cable
links right back there but I still was
able to route things with ease because
of the extra volume similar to how a
fractal design approach this but they're
defined see mesh if I see but for 69
bucks the P 350 X is one heck of a
bargain it's got to be my favorite case
in this price category because it really
has all the features I would want in a
mid Tower aside from maybe just the
luxuries of rubber grommets and things
you could really get by without in a $69
case I mean come on that's a dirt cheap
for what you're really getting here so
you do have to mount the power supply
from the right side of the case that's a
bit of a disappointment it was a very
tight squeeze remember this case is not
very tall so the space for the power
supply is literally just there for the
power supply and that's it there's no
extra breathing room although of course
if you turn your power supply upside
down the fan facing down then you can
use the dust filter including the
chassis to filter out dust and still
give your power supply plenty of a
breathing room another very cool aspect
of this case that I mentioned earlier is
the integrated RGB support so you do
have two dedicated buttons on top of
course paired with two USB 3.0 ports no
USB type-c or 2.0 you have your standard
headphone and mic
phone jacks but these two buttons
further down control both the colors of
the RGB you're seeing here and the mode
by which the LEDs kind of interact with
each other
so you can see here while I click this
one I'm controlling the color we've got
purple pink green blue pretty much every
color Under the Sun this is the one that
I've left it standard at so you could
see the array of colors at your disposal
and then the second button here changes
the mode so the way that the LEDs
interact with each other yeah and then
you can change the colors of them so
yeah these two buttons actually do quite
a bit these are addressable LEDs so top
the line stuff here for what you get in
a PC case and you can really make it
look your own and that's why I don't
shun RGB LEDs anymore means long as it's
done right and it's not overkill you
know we have rainbow puke going on most
of the time with this build that's
because I want to show you what you
could do color wise but being able to
customize the the look of the case and
just by LEDs alone is actually a really
cost-effective way to customize a case
without spending hundreds of dollars on
cables and custom shrouds and whatever
else you can think of to spend money on
one other concern I have this case it's
pretty standard by this point 2018 was
air flow there are ventilated grill
slits here running down the left and
right side of the front panel and there
is also included mesh now the mesh is
very fine and I found that with the
panel completely removed temperatures
across the board dropped by about three
to four degrees on the CPU side the
graphics card dropped by about two or
three degrees it really didn't change
much in the graphics card side I think
that's because we have the a i/o kind of
flowing like that warmer air from the
radiator through to the graphics card
that's just a consequence of running an
AO and this config but all together I
wouldn't say this is too restrictive of
a case in my experience at least you
know just comparing the panel off of
verse arm there seems to be a decent
amount of space for air to enter the
case on both the left and right side and
for it to turn slightly inefficiently I
should say at 90 degrees to enter the
volume of the chassis that you want to
be cool elsewhere the case seems pretty
healthy it stands firmly off the ground
by just under an inch again we do have a
mesh filter up top it's magnetic and
it's pretty straight forward that's how
I like to see it just a simple solution
up top is really all you need especially
for a case of
caliber and I'm really a fan not only of
the LED strip running along the side
here that you can see on camera right
now but also the two LED strips running
down the front panel these are not wired
by the way so you can completely remove
this panel and you can see we have these
static little connection points here
that when the front panel is mounted
will allow these RG bees to shine and
they will of course sync up with the
rest of the case depending on how you
calibrate things with those two buttons
on top a few other talking points the
tempered glass is very transparent it's
not tinted much at all that's how I like
to see things especially with the white
interior makes no sense to have a white
chassis with a really dark tinted panel
to me that just looks ugly despite
having a dark external paint job the
internal part of this particular model
is white so you kind of get the best of
both worlds right you don't the worry
about a white case not really matching
anything else in your room but you get
the aesthetics of a white build on the
inside with the white basement top and
the white motherboard a tray oh and one
of the cool thing about this case you've
actually mount hard drives from the
front and I'm not sure if other
manufacturers have done this mainstream
at this point but I hope fantex keeps
doing this because it's a much easier
way to install hard drives look it's
much easier in my opinion to remove a
front panel right then to remove a right
side panel because any gotta worry about
stuffing like cables back against the
motherboard tray and making sure it's as
tidy as possible back there just to
remove or to add a hard drive but if you
want to tweak with your hard drives in
this case and all you gotta do is remove
the front panel and you can just you
know use this hot swap a straight up
without interfering with the rest of
your cable management on the right side
so I think it's a very clever addition I
hope it stays in future revisions of fan
text cases so yeah I mean it's really
hard for me to knock on this case much
at all is just uh I'm trying to be
critical but it's difficult to do that
knowing this case it's the only 69 bucks
I'm telling you if I was on a budget if
I still cared about aesthetics but I
didn't want to spend you know a hundred
or so US dollars on a chassis which is
pretty much mainstream right now for
most mid tower cases then this is a case
I would get I wouldn't go with a P 300
anymore just because I think for 10
bucks you're getting a lot more in the
Pichu 50x and that's what fantex sought
to do was just improve things across the
board the building experience the looks
the aesthetics and only charge the
consumer ten dollars more
the p300 this case is smaller brother I
just I really like what they've done
here this would be my case for sure on a
budget and I think I'm gonna start
recommending this one from now on when
people ask for a cheap case that does
have RGB integration I'll let you kind
of customize things the way you want
that includes tempered glass that is a
mid Tower 69 bucks again 69 bucks like
it it's a really good deal I don't know
what else to say about it I'm really
impressed with the cost-effectiveness of
the P 350 X so I'm gonna stop freaking
out about the price now and ask you guys
what you think you're getting bang for
the buck wise with the P 350 X if you
have another fantex case let me know
what you think about it and how it's
been treating you over the past how long
you've had it Pepsi was trying to get
into the room I guess that's time for me
to go
so again leave your comments down below
I'll check them out I know probably not
gonna agree on everything but that's the
point rights was as a review that's why
opinions are kind of infused into this
I'm not trying to tell people how to
build cases I'm just trying to tell you
what I look for in cases and I love what
fantex did here this again is a review
we aren't being paid by fan texts to say
anything about this case I just like
what they've done and I really think you
should consider it in your next build
regardless with a $2,000 build or a $500
build 69 bucks is a heck of a bargain
for what you're getting again links in
the video description check those out
all the other fan text cases that I've
you know reviewed and tested in the past
are down there as well comment down
