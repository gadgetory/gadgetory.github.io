to try your best to discern between the
video capabilities of my iPhone 7 and
that of my own studio camera the
Panasonic Lumix fz1000 this camera does
have a one inch sensor it cost about
$800 but the iPhone 7 cost $700 granted
it doesn't only just take pictures and
that's pretty much all this camera here
that I'm using was intended for taking
pictures and recording video but I want
to see just how close we can get to DSLR
grade video quality with the newest and
best iPhone grant it's not the iPhone 7
plus so we don't have the dual lens zoom
capabilities but other than that it's
pretty much the same across the board so
with that said I'm going to film with
both the studio camera as well as my
iPhone I'm going to put them
side-by-side I won't tell you which side
is which and I'll give you just a few
scenarios in which you can try your best
to discern between the two in some cases
I expect it should be pretty one-sided
but in other cases like today it's
bright and sunny outside I think the
results are going to be fairly similar
so let's see how good you are discerning
between the two
well there you have it folks let me know
in the comments how many you got correct
and tell me which scenarios were pretty
darn close the iPhone 7 did fairly well
outside in fact in some instances I had
to refer back to the titles of the clips
and when I was editing in premiere
because I wasn't sure which clip were
went with which camera so the iPhone 7
did very well outside of course the much
smaller sensor is just a trade off with
the phone did cripple it indoors it was
much grainier overall and that that just
has to do with the fact that it's
letting in less light so the video
doesn't look as crisp and even with this
nearly $1000 camera it's still not a an
excellent in the dark video camera and
that that's something that that you
really have to spend a lot of money for
so that's the trade-off I'm going to
take here most of the time when I film
it's bright outside anyway but if you're
looking forward using I don't know some
kind of flagship top-end phone as your
daily driver for video work and things
of that sort I'd say you'd be okay in
most cases if you're willing to hold the
camera or some kind of tripod mount
that's compatible with phones but if you
can invest in a DSLR type camera
anywhere from 500 to a thousand dollars
I recommend at least 1080p 60fps and a
decent sensor size you will be a-ok for
the next few years if you like this
video be sure to give it a thumbs up
give it a thumbs down if you do feel the
complete opposite but if you especially
liked the video be sure to subscribe for
