video and in this one I am NOT going to
take the traditional approach and find
exclusively garbage deals on Craigslist
we're gonna mix it up just a little bit
for this one which is why the title says
what it says so we're gonna jump right
into this one remember these are just
this is just stuff that I found off the
top of you know a general Craigslist
search inquiry all I do is type in and
gaming PC so if you want to do something
similar you can send me your own links
maybe it'll be featured in the future I
read video but for now I've got about a
dozen or so and I think you're going to
enjoy them again a few of them are
actually pretty good deals and I would
say majority of them are still fairly
disappointing or cringy but nonetheless
you got a little mix of it this time
here we and go and alright the first one
we have here is actually a really good
PC I was super impressed with not only
the price of this thing but also just
the build quality the attention to
detail you can tell this guy's pretty
serious he's been doing it for quite a
while and yeah this isn't something that
you know most people can put together
their first time around so he's going to
GTX it looks like a 1080 TI from EVGA
it's a for the win card so it's a great
card one of the best 1080p eyes out
there actually and I've 780 700 K still
the best if not the second best gaming
CPU on the market 9900 K is one of those
that I wouldn't recommend I would just
say go 8700 K or or or rise in the 8
core for that matter but you want pure
gaming the 87 or K is still an excellent
CPU for that despite the price is going
up just slightly because of the 40
nanometers shortage 16 gigabytes of
Crucial 2040 megahertz of RAM this
frequency would normally be an issue if
we were talking about a risin PC because
those frequencies are tied again to the
Infinity fabric and the latencies
between C C X's but we don't have
anything like that
here because we're using the ring bus
cuz we're on Intel and this is a
perfectly viable kit of RAM 16 gigs is a
sweet spot right now for a games
MSI z 370 motherboard 750 watt fully
modular power supply be quiet dark rock
pro 4 I've tested that cool it's a great
cooler 500 gig samsung 970 Evo nvme SSD
this is actually super fast and drive so
it's really cool to see these got this
set up as a boot drive again this is
something that you probably wouldn't off
top your head if you were just building
something for
the first time let's say but the fact
that he's using the faster drive as the
boot drive is a really smart choice he's
also got a 500 gig Samsung 860 Evo this
is a SATA SSD so it will be slightly
slower but again he's using this for a
game library so not really an issue
there and then also a two terabyte
Seagate 7200 rpm hard drive he's got a
looks like a Wi-Fi card there at the
bottom and then a fractal design mesh if
I see tempered glass case excellent case
choice my friend and he wants $1,600 for
all of this this is a killer gaming PC
one of the best gaming PC's you can buy
today and he's only asking 60 hundred
bucks a build like this will easily cost
two grand new easy especially with the
drives he's got linked here so if you
live in I'm not sure where this was I
believe Los Angeles that's right so if
you live in the Los Angeles area
maybe check this one out because this is
actually a really good deal if he hasn't
sold it already I'd be surprised now
this one is also actually a pretty good
deal although one aspect of it is
slightly cringy if you just look at the
big picture you'll see there yeah that
was an eighty bucks is kind of a steal
for this system so he said he made this
PC in late 2014 he had GTX 970 and
originally over $2,000 was what he
apparently paid for the total system now
the new video card he's got in there is
a gtx 980ti
Strix from a soos and he's pretty pretty
right here I mean best non-art CX model
for average consumers I wouldn't say an
average consumer would spend this much
money on a 1080 TI these cards are still
70 hundred dollars but he's right I mean
it's the best non r-tx card you can
currently buy and he did good to include
that here a great upgrade the cpu he has
in there is an i7 4790 now the cringy
part is he's using the stock cooler you
can see in this picture here this is
what the old card but that's stock
cooler it gets very loud even though
this is a non overclocked skew he also
says that you can overclock and match
the CPU and RAM I'm not sure if he's
saying that you can overclock the CPU
obviously it cannot this is not a K CPU
skew which means you will not be able to
overclock it as a lock multiplier but he
did pair it with a z97 board so I guess
you could upgrade I don't know you want
to call so 4 to 792 a 4790k already
upgrade if you're still what four
generations behind
on intel side but and nonetheless I mean
it's a good foundation and with that new
graphics card in there I mean you just
if you just bought this just to part it
out like graphics got a loan would sell
for easily five six hundred bucks I'd
say on Amazon and that's over half of
what you'd be paying up front the RAM at
see he's got how much RAM does he have
in their TV villain 32 gigs of ram ddr3
but it's still 32 gigs and if people
aren't worried about dropping down to
Haswell architecture I mean 32 gigs is
still pretty expensive
that plus the motherboard and CPU
despite a disappointing cooler being in
there would probably sell for at least
300 bucks 400 bucks in my opinion you're
already at the thousand dollar target
and then you've got all this extra year
and here like the power supply the case
the storage drives to make up for for
any extra difference you have there and
probably make a few bucks too so the
potential investment opportunity here if
you're interested in just flipping parts
or just you know salvaging that 1080i
and selling off the rest of the kit this
is actually a pretty sweet deal now this
next one here in my opinion is one of
the sexiest looking that I've ever seen
on Craigslist and that's saying
something because I'm not normally a fan
of like soft tubing all right I'm
usually a hard tubing kind of guy ptg
acrylic most actually almost all of my
custom blue builds have been with hard
to me just cuz I think it looks better
but from this angle at least it looks
really clean I really like the the runs
he's got going on here and the entire
system with a color scheme it just works
I think the icing on the cake would be
some custom cables custom sleeve cables
maybe black and red to fit the rest of
the theme and that would be yeah that
would be just the perfect match right
there looks like you've got to replace
the tubing at some point this is
discolored unless this is like UV
reactive and this is normal but all in
all pretty sweet system and look he's
asking $2,000 for this right but that
might seem pretty high cuz he's only got
16 gigs of ram a GTX 1080 and then x3 70
so I'm not sure what the CPU is gonna be
a rising CPU do you list it
yeah 1800 X I'm blind and so that might
seem how he's asking a little too much
there but then look at all this EK stuff
he's got he's got the AEK waterblock
he's got UK coolant he's got the ek
reservoir
he's got a ek what is this a radiator
he's got basically ek fittings ek
everything I mean this is a pretty
impressive system he didn't cheap out
really at all I mean the ek waterblock
alone for the graphics card is a you
know around a hundred bucks and I'd say
the ek CPU block is probably in the same
ballpark just off the top of my head so
now I think if you were going for a
custom loop build I mean if you didn't
like what he did here you could take all
this apart and recycle all these
different fittings and different blocks
into a new system without having to pay
retail doesn't look like they've been
too abused or anything I think it's a
pretty sweet deal
now I'm including this one because I
actually think it's not a great deal I
don't think it's a great investment at
all from any standpoint because despite
this only being a $220 system which is
pretty cheap by gaming PC standards and
he's got it advertised as a six core AMD
gaming PC look to be honest it's just a
phenom - and we all know about FX
bulldozer piledriver architectures based
on the same stuff here 2.8 gigahertz is
nothing to be excited about six gigs of
ddr3 is not going to be enough for most
games a 7870 is pretty mediocre
especially with a two gig frame buffer
and everything else is just kind of it's
it's okay it's mediocre I would say the
power supply is pretty mediocre cable
management is not that great the case is
very old so you know you're you're
really compromising everywhere when you
decide to buy a $220 system now I'm not
picking on this guy because he's got a
cheaper system he's trying to sell I'm
just saying from a buyer's perspective
if you want something that's upgradable
that's a little more future-proof people
like using that term buying a system
like this is going to just roadblock you
from every perspective because you can't
really upgrade any of this straight up
and if you upgrade this the graphics
card your CP is gonna be the bottleneck
no matter what they don't need to
operate the entire system so in my
opinion makes no sense to buy a system
like this if you're interested in modern
1080p at least gaming now this one's
interesting too because it looks really
clean on paper this is something that I
would build something very similar to
this he's got the looks like the cable
mods sleeved AIO
tubes there which is really nice he's
got custom cables I don't assume he got
all this from cable mod so the custom
cables are about a hundred bucks he's
got a H 200 I let's just say a hundred
bucks there so we got 200 bucks let's
say 500 bucks
650 750 and then this one here let's
let's say 350 maybe 411 $1,100 right
let's say 1150 this will make it 1200
I'm being super conservative with these
numbers here 1250 1313 50 and then 1400
all right that's what we've got
basically in parts just off the top and
he wants two grand for it so it's
important that you break down all the
price of these components because you
could really build something very
similar if not exactly like this for
arguably cheaper than what he wants to
sell it at and this is a used PC right
you can build a brand-new one for I
would say less than this now this one
too seemed like a pretty sweet deal at
first glance it's got a rise in 1700 in
it granted this is you know at Black
Friday this was selling for around 150
bucks which is dirt cheap for an equal
risin CPU you know X Q or not and then
he's got a 1070 TI in here
he's got a gigs of wood no he's saying a
Giga it's a naked card obviously all
these are good cards how much RAM know
16 gigs of RAM let's see yep 16 gigs if
he's got tried + CR GB memory in here
alright so if you just again let's do a
part about a price break now let's say
150 for this right and then let's say
350 for this so that's 500 bucks 600
bucks 750 I don't know what kind of em
got to drive this is let's say 850 and
then nine hundred and the N win case is
probably another close to a hundred
bucks that's a thousand bucks right
there then you've got the power supply
thousand fifty maybe closer to $1,100
he's got Windows 10 Pro already on there
so he's really not asking anything
outrageous for this again all those fans
alone are gonna be an extra you know 50
or so bucks maybe more than that so a
thousand bucks is not outrageous you
know this this to me is a it's an okay
deal now he does say down here like he's
extremely firm it's kind of funny he
says the price is a good deal I will
ignore any offers under $1000 I mean do
you expect to get offers over at that
store
asking a thousand already it's kind of
what firm means so you know you might be
able to squeak out 900 bucks this guy
seems pretty firm obviously he's not in
this sale to really accrue a huge loss
but it's a good starting point
he's again he's not trying to rip you
off and he's showing all the specs all
the benchmarks and everything so I'm
sure you could see this in person
running before he decided to hand them
cash and yeah I'm okay with this one now
this one here it just annoys me it's
just a waste of time for every party
involved best gaming PC 2018 liquid
cooling he's got one dollar here okay
this is arguably the highest antenna TTI
air-cooled cord he can buy he's got what
else in here he's listed in the
processor like he lists the processor up
top
eighty seven or eight eighty eighty six
K basically an 8700 K he's got the
kingpin 22 TI one terabyte Samsung Evo
SSD he's got a Kraken X 62 850 power
supply right s 340 elite looking like a
really good system is also bundling
apparently an Asus already Swift PG 2 7
9 q it's really good monitor I use one
very similar to that and yeah so clean
looking system you can tell this
probably isn't his first his first rodeo
but then he doesn't list the price and
then you've got a Texas guy and you've
got to ask him first off how much does
he want for this system and then go on
from there I'm not sure if this is just
his selling tactic like he just assumes
that because he doesn't list the price
he's gonna draw on more buyers and maybe
that works but I'll tell you it's also
annoying from a buyer's perspective
because now I have to ask you an
additional question before we even get
to the meat and potatoes when it comes
to to bargaining and and working out a
deal where to meet all the good stuff so
if you're selling something on
Craigslist put the price don't be this
guy here $1 come on now this one is this
is one that it's kind of confusing to me
because he's got all this stuff listed
he's got it all parted out here and he
asked for 500 bucks he's got an RX 4 64
gig graphics card and athlon x4 860 K
processor in MSI 970 gaming motherboard
750 watt power supply and then as 16
gigs of ddr3 now the parts themselves
look it's difficult at this point to
three or a three plus chipset that
platform in my opinion is basically dead
unless you can get these parts for
twenty to forty bucks apiece but he
wants $500 let's take off a hundred
bucks for the four sixty another fifty
bucks for the power supply so we're down
to what 350 and let's take another let's
say let's take another hundred bucks off
for the 16 gigs of ddr3 which is giving
them that's giving them more than I
think it's worth but we're still left
with 250 bucks for just the CPU and
motherboard and that CPU isn't worth
anywhere near a hundred bucks I don't
think is any unlike it's worth anywhere
near 50 bucks in my opinion and that
motherboard is also pretty cheap
I've actually owned I think that exact
board not any more of the hundred bucks
not even close to it I wouldn't pay a
dime over
oh gosh for the CPU and motherboard I
wouldn't pay a dime over 50 bucks for
the combo I'm serious that's how that's
how cheap in my opinion this platform is
just from a performance perspective so
you expect to pay something similar to
what you get performance wise out of it
Rison three just blows this stuff out of
the water and especially in 80s 860 K so
yeah I think this is a bad deal I think
he's asking a lot more than you should
he should I would say start this off at
300 bucks you just cut this asking price
in half and then maybe he'll get a few
offers in his inbox now this one is uh
this one's a bit confusing right gaming
PC $1,100 all right well it better be
pretty good for $1,100 CPU is arising v
1600 this is selling for like a hundred
and thirty bucks on Black Friday so
let's say 140 bucks there we've got an
azrog board I can't tell what kind of
board let's assume it's a be 350 board
looks like you can get this for about 60
bucks or so these are these are pretty
cheap the RMS aren't that great feature
sets in general on these boards aren't
that great
so 150 plus fake let's just say 200
bucks for the pair
we've got oh gosh another sixty two
let's say 60 bucks worth of eight gigs
of RAM right so 260 plus a terabyte hard
drive so 300 and then this card which
may be 150 so that's 450 bucks and then
he's also including an MSI gaming
keyboard MSI mouse razer headset a OC
monitor I'm just not seeing it I mean
unless this monitors like a really
Killer monitor which I doubt it is
doesn't look like it is if you're if
you're not gonna be specific about the
parts then I'm going to assume they are
not very expensive parts that's on you
as a seller to disclose exactly what
you're selling or I will assume as the
buyer that that is just something you
didn't bother listing specifically
because it's not that impressive right
so AOC monitor I'm gonna say that's
pretty cheap I went ahead and looked up
the msi gaming keyboard and the mouse
the keyboard retails for like forty to
fifty bucks and I'm gonna assume that
the mouse is kind of in the same
ballpark so a hundred bucks maybe for
that pair I'm not sure what Razer
headset that is doesn't look like it's
too expensive so fifty bucks and then
the monitor is maybe a hundred bucks
resale value it just doesn't come
anywhere close to $1,100 so again this
is something that you have to break down
you know on a part by part basis to
rationalize the price in this case it is
not rationalized and this entire ad
should be avoided that's not a bad
looking system that's a thermal take
versa h18 tempered glass case if you're
wondering there's got an NVIDIA GTX 1063
gig kind of sucks she's got a three gig
buffer there but whatever will work with
it so let's say gosh 200 bucks it's
probably cheaper than that let's give
him the benefit of the doubt $200 there
50 bucks another 50 bucks so that's 300
bucks 350 there we go let's say 150 for
this which is still stretch that's for
what 350 500 and then this CPU which is
actually a it's a ni 7 but it's very
very down clocked from like a
consumer-grade i7 let's say 40 790 so I
wouldn't pay a dime over maybe one the
150 ish for the CPU so that puts us in
the ballpark of 650 or so he's saying it
comes with a dell 24-inch monitor
keyboard mouse all cables and then
Windows 10 home assuming that's an
activated version of Windows 10 that
wouldn't make this deal too bad you
might be able to talk this guy down to
about 600 bucks it looks like though
he's looking for a quick flip and that's
why he's priced it competitively to
begin with so you might be able to work
with this guy
all in all look it's not it's nothing to
be excited about I'm not a big fan at
all that stock cooler
although the CPU I am
GDP is quite low so you probably don't
need a very beefy cooler to keep this
thing from a temp perspective in check
and the last thing we're gonna laugh at
here is an lg tv has a 60 inch plasma
HDTV but the reason why I clicked on
this is because this is very clearly not
a 60 inch TV if this was a 60 inch
aspect here can you imagine how thick
these bezels must be there's got to be
like five inch thick bezels out so just
yeah
that would look so bad on a 60 inch
panel as are you saying 1080p 600 Hertz
plasma HDTV for only 198 and then like
he copies and pastes this looks like a
like a used car salesman ad that he just
ripped but no like twisted it to fit his
narrative about a TV and then he lists
the specs like he just kind of throws
all this stuff up on screen I'm not a
fan of this sort of ad on Craigslist I
think this is just minimal effort
obviously you don't care much about the
product you don't care much about
selling it because you didn't bother
taking a picture of it
who ever wants to buy this TV is going
to ask you for pictures so why not do us
the favor up front do us what we think
we deserve if you're interested in
selling something and put them you know
put the picture on Craigslist on the
site you're trying to sell the product
on so that we know what we're getting
into when we actually make contact with
you personally I don't know maybe that
maybe this you know what the maybe I'm
completely wrong here maybe this is
actually what it looks like right it may
be this is a 60-inch Plasma HDTV a 60 PS
11 I actually didn't even bother looking
this up beforehand 60 PS 11 let's see
60-inch Plasma TV I'm gonna laugh so
hard if this is actually what it looks
like it's actually what it looks like uh
wow that's gonna be a really thick bezel
I mean how old is this TV
let me see when it was released can we
find a release date so we've got a bunch
of comments from people about what seven
years ago so this is at least a 7 year
old panel we're talking maybe 2010 2011
when this came out good gosh and
honestly I'm not even joking that looked
like a monitor to me I was just ripping
on this guy because I thought it was you
know like a 24 inch 1080p lg monitor but
this is an old-school plasma though I
mean I guess if you're in a plasma is a
200 bucks maybe that's a good deal I
don't know you can get pretty sweet LED
TVs for 300 bucks that are close in size
maybe 50-inch 55 inch I would take that
over this just old school like this is
like a dinosaur right here anyway
just kind of school myself by doing like
five seconds worth of research but there
you go a 60 PS 11 is a 1080p plasma TV
with a dick with two C's bezel wrap it
all the way around it so maybe you'll
learn something in this one I see people
are saying you don't learn stuff in the
I read playlist but here you go you
learn about a an old-school plasma TV
someone was trying to sell again no I
still think that the person should post
original pictures but this is it was
kind of funny so apart from that last
one which I'm a bit embarrassed about
I'm not gonna remove it from the video
that I want this to appear natural ish
at least I'd say that we had a mixed bag
today there were certainly some great
deals and I've I don't want to link
those down below because then it draws a
possibly unwarranted attention to people
who were just trying to sell locally I
get that but if you live in those areas
I encourage you to find those ads
yourself and potentially hit up those
people because some of those pcs were
again really great just off the top
looking at the pictures and the asking
prices weren't too outrageous most of
the time we do these videos we see
outrageous prices from people who either
have no idea what they're doing or just
looking to rip somebody off but in this
case not too bad we're a few that we're
still just
ah stress but yeah it's nice to mix
things up a little bit I know a few of
you were asking for some ads that were
on the more favorable side right from
the virus perspective and hopefully you
got a good dose of that in this video so
now this is the part where you guys tell
me what you think about the video if you
liked it and give it a thumbs up you
disliked it or hate everything about
life can click the dislike button click
that red subscribe button if you haven't
already I would appreciate that you can
also become a member you want to be
fancy get special icons and other unique
badges for live streams and the comment
sections does help us out also by the
way we like $3.50 of your five-dollar
subscription every month so that would
be super cool of you if you're
interested in that and stay tuned of
course for more interesting content
we've actually got an ultra budget the
cheapest cheapest am4 motherboard I
could find on Amazon video coming up
soon I think you'll I think you'll
really like that one and then we've got
a very budget oriented PC build that we
will benchmark will play for tonight Pub
G other competitive games you guys are
interested in and see if it holds up
especially once you in the context of
what you get for around six seven
hundred dollars right that's where you
can step it up to maybe gtx 1060 RX 580
you guys know how that works this is
