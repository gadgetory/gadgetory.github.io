winner of the gtx 1070 giveaway right
now that winner is Dominic Joe our ski
it looks like you're an American Dominic
you're the first American to win a
giveaway here at L is our studio
so congratulations it don't worry if you
live anywhere else even if you still
live in the US there's still one more
chance to win a graphics card before
Christmas and that's thanks to candid a
GTX 1080 will be given away and that
giveaway and it ends I think December
18th see this video right here if you
haven't already it's not too late to
join sign up for that one it's not very
difficult to sign up either if you hear
that that was my shoulder and now for
the meat of this video I'll be
introducing you to a very awesome case
in a vlog style format you've probably
seen the case before but maybe not like
this so I do hope you enjoy well this is
my room for what used to be my room
hence the very cheesy wallpaper if
you've been around for a while you know
this is where I used to film all my
videos but if you're new to the channel
yep I have the cheesy wallpaper just
kind of all over the place you can see
that's my storage facility over there
all the boxes the studio lights my bed
which is not made Jay Jay doing his
thing and yeah just kind of make and do
with the space I have I have a very
unorthodox computer desk it's actually a
dresser that I turned into a makeshift
computer desk of sorts I think I did a
clever little thing here with the
keyboard kind of inland one of the
drawers the mouse kind of sucks where it
is it's not ideal but it's all the space
I have it's it's decent I can I can get
by with it for about a month don't worry
we'll be back in the old studio and all
around January 9th or so so the video is
going to be about the be quiet
dark Bass Pro 900 this is a very large
case I want to show you what it looked
like well what the Box looked like just
because this is very large and put it
next to something like a genome that's
actually a large case on its own it's
still nothing compared to the dark based
Pro 900 and the s 340 elite just looks
so small in comparison that's the one
I'm sporting right now for Heisenberg
we're going to take all of that inside
there and throw it into there so time
lapse here we go
okay right off the bat I just want to
give you my first impressions of this
case just how beautiful it is it's a
very large case you have plenty of room
in here like I said I wouldn't expect
anything other than ATX full-size ATX or
even extended ATX in a case like this
it's all supported I didn't know that
this was a tempered glass panel but it
is and it looks like let's see here well
these are user on there
these are thumb screws although these
are fairly tight I can't use my thumb's
to remove them now we get a Qi charger
up top just like brushed aluminum it
doesn't feel cheap at all lots of air
vents all over the place check this out
this cool door here just clicks right
open and you're greeted with looks like
silent wings three wouldn't be surprised
it looks like silent wings three fans
here these look like 140s and look like
we had a third one in the back and the
door itself is of course soundproofed
this is coming from a company called be
quiet so I honestly expect nothing less
something else I want to point out the
screws are already embedded in the case
that's a great thing that's just like
the s340 elite I love it when tempered
glass panels are fixed that way on a
case and not the other way around where
you have to insert the screw after you
try to align as best you can a tempered
glass to the holes in the case so
another good thought on their part and
let's see I'm gonna head and remove this
and we had an idea just how much a real
estate we have on the inside here well
if you were worried about how many hard
drives you're going to fit in your case
check this out one two three four five
six seven native just like the reminds
me of the NZXT h 440 so plenty of
storage expandability in there and all
of this is removable so this is a very
modular case as you'll see here shortly
we're going to take a lot of this out
just for that bare-bones look for
Heisenberg Oh check this out you get LED
strips in the case I had no idea that it
came with something that's actually kind
of cool I get to say the ones I already
had planned for this one and just use
these instead oh yeah now that is what
I'm talking about check that out rigid
RGB strips that is pretty dope
hey there's the little man and my baby
princess nesting on okay come on
mommy come on I promised some pom pom
footage so I'm trying my best here but
they're not they're not willing
contestants
okay so here is the bill that should
probably zoom out just a little bit this
is the dark Bass Pro 900 obviously and
you can see that there's way more space
than I typically need I you know I only
have one hard drive in here and the
solid-state drive is behind the
motherboard there what are you doing hey
hey get that out of your mouth
that's my microphone which I probably
should be using right now just gonna use
the camera's microphone for now what are
you doing anyway I thought it was really
cool that they included there's some
other things that are necessary but that
make the case look even better than it
already does so the LED strip up top I
installed the hue plus so we have you
know the three AER fans one thing I do
want to mention I do have two silent
wink threes up top above the radiator
it's a weird config only because I
wanted to have the LED showing whoo
excuse me excuse me so I had to arrange
these to where they were exhausting out
the front as well as the back and then I
oriented the fans on top which are two
silent wink threes from be quiet coming
in basically pulling in air from the top
so it's really weird design I don't
recommend it honestly it's probably not
going to stay this way for long but just
for aesthetic purposes I think it looks
the best as it is the cool thing about
the LED strip that they included up top
if you open this panel here which is you
know just a simple little click I didn't
install the little drive covers here but
I'll do that shortly there's a little
button now you can't see it because it's
really dark there's a button here you
can push and it changes the tone of the
LED that's connected to the fan hub at
the back of the case the fan hub is also
integrated comes with the case and you
can wire your LED strip directly into
that fan hub for basically full control
via the case itself you can also control
fan speed with this little dial here so
I'll show you here the fans ramp up
so that right there is full speed and
then you can turn them back down and
it's just a little dial here so I gotta
do is just push it back this way and
they settle back down again I haven't
tested sound yet how loud everything is
while in the case although I expected
should pass with flying colors
these ier fans are noticeably louder
than the silent wings three I have three
of these in here whereas with my s340
elite which I tested a bit earlier I
didn't have any of these in there only
had one stock fan and then three sound
one threes so these fans are louder the
case is already at a disadvantage but I
expected this cases just going to do a
heck of a job at suppressing that noise
so here we go
now a few things that I want to be picky
about that I experienced when building
in this case you think that there would
be tons of room for cable management and
the like but there really wasn't I
actually found that there was more cable
management headway in the s340 believe
it or not I know that sounds hard to
believe but I think that a big reason
for why that's the case is because all
of these hard drive trades are
pre-installed don't have that they don't
come with covers so once you remove the
the bay you you don't have anything
blocking this so it would look really
just terrible to have cables kind of
just weaving in and out of here and that
is where a good amount of my cables
typically end up and I'm running along
the side here and you can see it's it's
pushed in a little bit this is recessed
here so there's not a lot of space
between the back panel and the
motherboard tray and that kind of that
caused problems when it came to you can
see down there the bottom just a lot of
the cables got bunched up it was very
difficult putting the back panel on
that's a good sign of poor cable
management I think another reason why it
was rather difficult to cable managed in
this case is because the case itself
doesn't include a basement they do that
on purpose because they want to make
space obviously for all these hard drive
trays and if you want to throw a custom
loop in here you will have plenty of
space to do that you probably fit two
reservoirs comfortably and just a
full-on loop through everything but I
don't have that yet and most of my stuff
you know fits perfectly into a mid-size
mid-sized Tower so this is super
overkill for what I have this just goes
to show you how much space you do have
at your disposal but do keep in mind it
will be difficult to cable manage and
you don't have a basement to cover any
of that ugly management up so it's all
going to be pretty much showing you can
see I have a mess back there
that's just what you get when you opt
for a case that doesn't have a basement
and these are our custom sleeve cables
too so these aren't extensions these
they're oh these are almost measured out
perfectly there's a you know a few
different strands of SATA cables back
there that are kind of bunched up but
everything else including the 24 pin and
even the CPU eight pin up there are all
measured out pretty close to the length
of this case so there's not much slack
there if I was using extensions I
imagine this would have been even more
difficult to build
and you see they're just some weird
designs I mean I don't know what the
purpose of this is right here to recess
the power supply from the back of the
case you're looking right now at what I
was having to do to secure this to the
little bracket sticking out here I had
to undo these screws and pull off these
panels in order to screw the motherboard
into the bracket from the back that's
the only way to do it is coming in from
the from the rear so it's just a weird
design I don't know why they recessed it
I have no idea what the intention was
what the purpose was behind that but
it's it's like that you still have
plenty of space for you know a very
extended power supplies if there was a
basement here you could just bunch up
all your cables here but you know it's
just some some weird things I don't I
don't know what that's for maybe
somebody does in the comments I'm sure
there's a reason I just I am not seeing
it right now in terms of mounting
capabilities we have a 280 millimeter
radiator appears to crack an X 62 C it
comes to about here so we could probably
go I think a full 420 would fit in this
case you'd be cutting it very close
I might not opt for a 420 I think a 360
would be the furthest I would go but you
you have that option there and in the
front you have another it looks like if
I want to say 280 280 millimeter mount
because II these are 2 140 fans so you
have a little bit more space up top but
I'd say at 280 s about as far as you
want to go there and then you also have
a 140 millimeter mount in the back so
that that's just testament to how wide
the case is most cases only have a 120
here and as I said earlier you do have
two five and a quarter inch drive bays
so if you're a fan of CD drives you have
an option for two of those up top maybe
something else like a fan controller you
know plenty of room up there pretty much
anything that you would want to throw in
a computer this case supports the case
is also raised by about an inch off of
the desk thanks to its integrated feet
these are very sturdy and they're pretty
much mounted to the bottom of the case
itself and then you do have about an
inch worth of breathing room if you want
to put fans on the bottom or something
else along those lines you can actually
squeeze a fan underneath this tray and
maybe put something like a radiator on
top and you do have plenty of space for
that air to flow out of the case through
the sides here on the bottom and then
same goes for the top I have to silent
wing 3 140 millimeter fans pulling in
air from the top and then the radiator
mounted underneath that so you can
definitely fit fans in this space here
there's about an inch and a half worth
of space up top as well as in the bottom
not as much space it looks like in the
bottom but most people don't put stuff
down there anyway but you do have that
access up top pretty much run it all the
way across except for when you get to
the Qi charger if your phone supports
wireless charging you can use the
built-in charger it's all wired directly
into the fan hub the fan hub pretty much
controls everything in the back of the
case everything up front
speaking of which IO ports you have 2
USB 3.0 ports microphone jack headphone
jack power button very large very sturdy
like that a reset switch hard drive
notification LED and then 2 USB 2.0
ports it's just there's just a lot of
space in your folks there's so much that
you can do with this case it honestly
looks bare-bones right now because I
don't have a lot of stuff to fill to
fill it up with I don't have seven hard
drives or a custom water loop but pretty
much anything that you want to do with
this case you can do and I can't
reiterate that enough
that's what full-size towers are for
it's why I don't personally use them but
this just goes to show you you know we
have plenty space to work with
so those are my raw impressions of the
dark base Pro 900 not honestly a case
that I would personally go after it's
not my style I'm more of an NZXT s340
kind of guy
also p400 from fantex course they're 400
see those kinds of cases are more my
alley I'm willing to compromise on
available space for the sake of just
having a more compact look but if you're
the kind of guy or gal who likes the
hard drive space or need space for
custom water loop or likes adding all
the extra fans radiator support the
extra space between a graphics card and
the front panel all of that is available
in the dark base Pro 900 I have links to
the case in this video's description
check those out down below leave a
comment suggestion or question in the
comment section if you have one of those
be sure to give this video a thumbs up
if you thought it was cool give it a
dislike if you feel the complete
opposite or if you hate everything about
life click the subscribe button if you
haven't already
stay tuned for battle of the beasts I
finally have something to pit against
the cryo rig r1 and that
this megalith from be quiet is a 250
watt whoops I click something a 250 watt
TDP cooler for reference an air cooler
capable of 250 watts of thermal
dissipation that is insane and we're
going to pick both of these also against
the captain 240 X which is a 240
millimeter all on one radiator combo in
the rig behind me stay tuned for that
it's going to be an awesome video I
can't wait to get started
this is Salazar studio thanks for
learning with us
