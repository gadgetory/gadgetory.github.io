double-check just in case yeah yeah so
unless YouTube is lying to me I am
talking to all of you right now and how
you guys doing this is a low latency
stream we're testing this just to see
how how much worse the video quality is
right now as it's been factually the
past six or so live streams we've been
streaming from the Sony camera to an
advert media capture card and look in
hindsight like the capture card is only
a 1080p 60 capable capturecard and I
regret that because I I would much
prefer 4k 60 just for those who have the
ability to stream at that rate you know
to watch the streams so yeah I'm gonna
yeah someone says post the deals how
about checking the video description
they're already down there you should
probably just probably look at that
first we are right now we're ready to
dive through these again if you just
want to look at the links those are just
the ones that I found I use Newegg and
Amazon primarily those are two of the
bigger text sources here in the States
for us tech enthusiasts I guess but I'm
gonna talk about my rationale as to why
I chose those parts and also talk about
some things that I expect we will see in
the the next few days possibly because
these deals tend to extend about a week
or so long unless of course we run out
of stock of certain items which happened
actually the best deal that I found so
far was I believe it was a rise in 717
hundred for like a hundred and fifty
bucks or something along those lines
very very cheap we're talking below core
i5 comparable core i5 CP prices which is
just at this point it's just laughable
like AMD can and will do these things in
the future and Intel just takes it like
that I don't know if they care if they
wish they could drop prices according to
many sources they still can't they're
still struggling with inventory just
because of the 12 nanometer fabrication
being consumed by both chipsets and CPUs
at this point we have videos talking
about this stuff but you guys are here
for the deals so we're gonna jump into
that good stuff and if you guys find
anything as well I'm gonna have we have
Co fossils
the moderators here in the chat if we
have issues posting some links I know
YouTube like completely bans links for
some reason and in chat boxes but you
guys find some good stuff let us know
even if you don't want to link just tell
us the product and where you found it
and we might even include it here on
this live stream just because I'm open
to sharing anything goodies you guys
found online I don't think that we
should keep the secret even though you
know you want to be the first to the
product I totally get that just make
sure that you you know buy the product
if you want to buy it before you post it
on this chat or any other place that
might have a little bit of publicity
because these things you know the
inventory levels are pretty much on the
DL you don't know how many they have in
stock and if ten people buy them boom
that could be it you know this could be
the ten people that get it at a good
price so what I'm going to do is switch
to I wanna make sure that this actually
works I'm gonna switch to my desktop
here and you guys are gonna see the
first deal in our list so y'all let me
know what's going on
Thanks bazinga totally appreciate that
uh that hair coming I know it's it's bad
you know like here's how I know when I
need a haircut when I can't brush it and
it do what I wanted to do anymore that's
pretty much the that's the limit for me
anyway I know this is kind of a weird
window here you're looking at Amazon
Prime I have the zoomed out for these
three this is something I showed in the
Black Friday deal video but you can see
64 gigs for an SD card like this 1099
it's basically a freaking Steel 32 gig
card again pretty similar transfer rates
reads and writes 6 bucks like it's kind
of a sin to not purchase something like
this for 6 dollars if you're in need of
any SD card at all actually I bought two
of these here the 128 you can see here
20 bucks and if you have Amazon Prime
that's 20 bucks shipped so if you guys
are into some you know super
transferrable storage drives like SD
cards maybe you want one for your phone
or for a camera maximally using the two
128's for my cameras one of them is
actually in the camera right now then
this this would be a sweet drive for I
think the reads here up to a hundred
megabytes per second reads and then 90
megabytes per second right that's plenty
for fork
thirty that's what I do here so by the
way if the chatbox is like in the way of
anything I'm sure it will be I can get
rid of that so just uh just yell at me
if if you can't see anything that you
are interested in noticing on screen
scroll it now now to the second link we
have a sapphire rx Vega a 64 I'm gonna
check the look I'm watching the live
stream kind of live just to see if I'm
overlapping anything I think I'm hiding
the price maybe I might I might be no
I'm not okay all right cool so yeah this
is it's a Vegas 64 card and think what
you want about Vega I do think the these
cards were largely flops for a number of
reasons I think inventory levels the
fact that these came out like right
before everything just hit the fan
through guards to graphics card prices
and the mining craze these cards are
still viable for gaming they definitely
are Vegas 64 is comparable to a GTX 1080
or even to a to a degree in art r-tx 27
if you want to look at it from a Turing
perspective and right now 400 bucks is
pretty sweet the only thing is though
you're getting the blower style card
here it's a sapphire branded blower
start cover is basically a reference
cooler for all intents and purposes so
should just come up backplate I did not
check this one came in the back plate it
does though most cards of this caliber
gonna have back plate so just I don't
know why you wouldn't want to have a
back plate at this price but you can see
here three DisplayPort outs single HDMI
out that should be pretty
run-of-the-mill at this point especially
for a higher-end card and you guys know
Vegas 64 I have my review of Vegas 64 on
the channel I wasn't too pleased with
the price of Vega 64 when it came out
with respect to what we were getting
from a GTX 1080 write or even a gtx 1070
i do i do think that vega 64 is a
slightly it's just it's an alternative
it really is because you could get a gtx
1080 for basically the same price at
this point so if you're if you're want
to support AMD if you appreciate AMD
software then that might be the route
you take i have honestly if i to choose
my choice would be probably a gtx 1080
just because
I'm more familiar again with Nvidia
software I'm familiar with GeForce
experience this isn't me touting Nvidia
believe me I have my own issues with how
and video released this latest
generation of cards but now I find a
cheese just to be perfectly you know
open with you guys it would be a 1080
for me just because again that's I think
there's little more value in a 1080 I
think some games do run considerably
better on a GTX 1080 then the Vegas 64
counterpart and ten aids are really
there they're really power efficient and
very quiet so you know you don't like
blower style cards you definitely don't
want this one now we're gonna switch on
over to whoops I just completely booked
put you're down one you see make sure
that I I swapped it correctly you should
be looking at now yeah okay cool and
Acer gaming series 24 inch 144 heard to
1080p panel now III want to disclose I
should have done this up front all the
links down below there's our affiliate
links again I've talked about this in my
last video with regards to you know how
we get paid from affiliate links it's a
very small percentage usually no more
than about 3% so if you click on any of
these links and you navigate anywhere I
need I'm buying something we get a small
Commission for basically leading you
know the the buyer to the seller for
kind of I guess in a way working as a
middleman for the exchange there but all
those links are to products that I and
will go through all of these that I have
at least some degree of hands-on
experience with or maybe have hands-on
experience with a derivative of that
product so this one is like a killer
deal in my opinion I think that this is
gonna give me a haircut if this thing in
my opinion this is a this is a heck of a
deal I am using an Acer 4k panel right
now I really like Acer screens I think
acer makes some of the better screens
out there just with my experience these
panels now I'm not too sure about the
pressure as a TN panel oh and don't want
to say it's a TN panel it's fine you
know what's funny is if they don't say
that it's an IPS panel then it's
probably a TN panel and it's not
something you typically just promote
because 10 is the
usually regarded as more obsolete screen
technology let's just go to specs here
and sure enough TN so there you go so if
you're against TN I totally get it right
I mean you have the right to decide what
you think is good and what's not but I
think I think teens a great compromise
actually a very reasonable compromise
for a hundred and seventy dollar
fourteen sorry 144 Hertz panel even in
the 1080p resolution 1080p at 24 inches
about as about as high as we're going to
go I would say if you get up to 27
inches 1440 piece gonna be your sweet
spot with respect to pixel per inch
densities right basically your ability
to discern individual pixels becomes
more apparent the larger the screen size
gets if your resolution is fixed right
so when you jump up from 24 to 27 if
there's a noticeable size increase there
and if you're sitting roughly 2 to 3
feet from your monitor I would say that
the jump and resolution from 1084 teen
40s is justified but in the case of a 24
inch panel I think 1080p is just a sweet
spot especially considering in this
price and there is I know I see cyber
nuance just pointed out that there is a
$20 promo as well so if you guys use the
CM 8101 promo code then you'll also get
an extra 20 bucks off so that means you
can get this monitor for a hundred and
fifty bucks if you have Newegg like the
equivalent of new like primary new ike
premier i think is what it's called
i used to have it when i was a student
but i just i order more stuff from
Amazon so I just have Prime but if you
have premier or whatever it's called and
you can get free shipping on that as
well I think it's free three-day
shipping for Newegg but shipping here
let's just like assume let's just assume
we're going to uh okay Oh
shipping is maybe they're gonna tell us
after I enter all my stuff anyway I
don't expect shipping to be too
expensive here and yeah I think that's a
really great monitor again check out the
link below if you're interested in that
monitor let me know if you have it this
is probably something I'll actually buy
myself just to review but I'm very
confident again an Acer panel's I'm not
gonna recommend something I think is
absolute crap you guys wouldn't trust me
again when it comes to
mending and all that good stuff but I
think it's a I think it's a great deal
just on paper alone that reviews look
pretty good and we'll see Logitech c920
and 22 price on weird to say c9 - -
anyway if you guys are interested in
streaming at all if you're just a little
maybe you're a little hesitant with
regards to the amount of money it's
gonna cost to get started in in in the
streaming business if you will maybe you
want to stream to twitch you don't have
many viewers maybe let's say you have
5-10 viewers right are you expect to get
that much when you start out it's still
pretty good amount if you could those
concurrent but even if you're a hundred
two hundred concurrent a c920 or a c9 22
X in this case is a perfectly viable
camera because here's my rationale
behind that when I decide let's say
let's say I want to play pub G right and
I want my viewers to watch the game not
necessarily me then what I'm going to do
is shrink my camera window down on that
display screen that you guys see live
very you know do a very small corner
let's say I put on the bottom left
corner or bottom right corner wherever
the map isn't with respective pub G you
guys are gonna notice that I'm using
let's say 720p 60fps or 1080p you might
notice the framerate difference there
especially if you're upscaling the
framerate to 60 if you're playing on 30
but if you're gonna be streaming a game
I expect you'll be streaming at 60fps at
60 P whatever so I don't think that the
resolution necessarily matters and I
don't think you need a super high-end
camera with a capture card to give
yourself a really crispy look on screen
because nobody cares about necessarily
you they're looking at what you're doing
on screen if you're gonna be playing if
you're gonna be a twitch streamer twitch
gamer then in my opinion yeah that's
that's what I would go with the c920 2x
and actually Lisa uses the c920 and the
c920 - is the one that kind of isolates
you it deletes your background I'm not
sure how effective this is I've seen
many people use it and it looks to be a
pretty efficient way to do it without
needing a green screen so that
technology is pretty cool and again look
out of like roughly 10,000 customer
reviews about 4.3 stars out of 5
I would say for all three of these here
that's a pretty good ratio and at least
it just came it and because it's a
pretty good ratio and I don't expect you
guys to just rely on reviews and told
you guys not to do that she's standing
behind the camera now nobody got ten
thousand it's a pretty good sample and
again we have testimonials here like
Lisa uses the c920 how good is your
webcam good it's good
yeah so she likes it and if Lisa likes
it you know she could she just she's not
a big twitch streamer but she wants to
get big and she's been trying to get
back into it she's gonna get back into
it next week yeah next week I just
realized that nobody saw you because I
was showing the screen the whole time
sorry anyway yeah I think this was
really good now I just kind of summed
this one up
fifty bucks is pretty cheap pretty entry
level camera but it will get the job
done so if you're into twitch stuff then
there you go
moving on now to the crucial mx-5
hundred two and a half inch SSD this is
a typical internal SSD these right here
are pretty baller because they only cost
roughly sixty bucks now I did see a
couple others I saw another SSD I
believe it was from I want to say it was
from a data and a data had one for fifty
nine bucks so I mean SSDs right now are
super cheap that's really what I want
you to take away from this this isn't
this isn't strictly a Black Friday deal
per se you can see this one was used to
be eighty to ninety nine but I mean come
on
so sixty five bucks is really good this
again probably will last through Black
Friday week and maybe into Christmas
time but if you are in need of a roughly
you know half terabyte drive or so then
$64.99 in my opinions as a freaking good
price is what I'll say about it and then
if you want to drop down to a 250 gig
good for an OS and maybe a couple Steam
games Adobe suite whatever look at just
over 40 bucks and again this is on
Newegg so if you guys are interested
check out that link below let's see they
do have the m dot 2 version that's I'm
curious if I see the m dot to use I mean
these are gonna be the same these are
just the SATA data in about twos so
essentially the same reads and writes
just a different form
Derr again it should be connected
directly to your motherboard so you
won't actually have a two and a half
inch drive sticking out anywhere that's
a fairly bigger intrusive just a little
bit of flexibility there looks like a
$10 difference so it's up to you but
this is just one of the ones I found I
was scrolling through and if you guys
have any yeah I see some you know Leslie
just said that you know mx-5 hundreds a
60 Evo's ultra three DS they're all
really good friends
I trust crucial crucial is one of the
ones that I do trust and crucial is a
micron brand I also trust Samsung
definitely and then I trust a data
probably those are my big three when it
comes to SSDs I've had those I've had
many drives from all three of them and
they all worked out very well I actually
haven't had a single drive die and you
guys know how many computers we build
with tons of drives and stuff so it's
just a first-hand testimony oh they're
up next on the list again you can find
these links down below this is the team
group T force Delta R GB RAM these
modules are pretty sick I actually have
I'm not used this specific kit I've used
the the nighthawk ddr4 modules basically
the exact same modules they just have a
different heatsink on them I'm pretty
sure these are all Samsung B dies if I'm
not mistaken I want to say they are I
remember them telling me at Computex and
I'm not mistaken your Samsung B dies
I have to double check on that but very
reliable again these are pretty fast
modules too you can see we're at about
3,000 megahertz this is optimal for if
you're gonna run these with horizon
platform 3,000 megahertz is pretty much
where you start to see a severe
diminishing returns curve play out you
jump from 21 to 33 megahertz to about 26
66 you see a huge reduction in latency
with respect to the Infinity fabric and
that of course speeds up everything
right your entire system feels more
responsive especially in game and then
if you jump up to 3000 the difference
between that 2656 isn't nearly as big as
from 21 33 to 20 666 but it's still a
noteworthy jump I would say you'll get a
few extra frames in most games and so if
you're you know
curious about that this is why I would
justify a faster kid of RAM in a
nutshell for rise in platforms in
particular intel doesn't really matter
most applications including games aren't
going to be frequency dependent with
respect to Ram and honestly games aren't
dependent in general with the on the
frequency of RAM it's just because of
the way that AMD ties infinity fabric
into timings Ram timings and read
frequencies that's why it games are
indirectly you know performing better
with faster RAM kits on rising platforms
but just make sure if you go in with a
rise in one platform let's say 1700 or
1600 you know 1600 X any of those chips
they're gonna be pretty stubborn most of
them when it comes to overclocking
running XMP out of the box
I suggest updating your BIOS to the
latest version if possible and just kind
of playing with it from there you might
not be able to enable XMP at all I would
not be surprised none of my rising
samples we're able to run XMP out of the
box so you might have to do some manual
tinkering with your ram frequencies and
timings that's always a pain
overclocking memory sucks especially
when you're going past spec but if you
can get it again to 3000 that's pretty
much your sweet spot so yeah these look
really good I can attest to this
firsthand the RGB Tsar very diffused
they look really good and look for a
hundred and ten bucks I know again I
said this in the last video it's kind of
crazy to think that 16 gigs of ram for a
hundred and ten bucks or so is a good
deal because two years ago it really
wasn't a good deal you get these for 80
bucks even 70 bucks sometimes but 110
for right now this is a good price if
you were waiting for Ram prices to go
down before you built your first PC
I'd say jump all over this this is
pretty much everything you could want
and a kid of RAM and this is going to be
aura Asus aura compatible know it's
compatible pretty much everything I'm
pretty sure you can sync it up with a a
soos or a sink I'm pretty sure it works
with gigabytes software as well as well
as MSI mystic light so all you really
have to do is plug these these modules
these dims into a motherboard that's
compatible with this stuff and then you
can control all the lighting via your
motherboard software you don't even need
to download dedicated software for these
modules which i think is really
just save space and time you don't have
to clutter your desktop with a ton of
otherwise pointless applications okay
moving on to one of my favorite cases
actually of all time you guys know this
one very well the fractal design mesh
fic and the reason why I pointing this
one out is because well you can see
right here 75 bucks for this case a
tempered glass version of this case I'm
pretty sure that I'm pretty sure I this
was a while back so I don't remember I
know that defines C had a non tempered
glass version at first and then they
came out with a tempered glass version I
don't know if the metruff I see yeah I
did it did have a non typical s version
well I'm not sure that answers my
question I wasn't sure if they had an
acrylic version first
but anyway tempered glass I mean this is
basically the same price as a comparable
acrylic version if they had one so 75
bucks I think is a really good deal
again these usually retail for about 90
to 100 dollars and you're gonna get
great air flow with this case again the
whole front panel is basically one big
just slab a mesh so you can stack fans
up front the only thing I would keep in
mind when you buy this case again I've
talked about this in my build logs with
this case also in some dedicated reviews
of fractal products in the past this
particular chassis is very narrow from a
depth perspective and so what I mean by
that is if you plan on putting a really
long graphics card into your system and
then also maybe an a IO which will
require fans as well so you've already
got that much space taken up by your AI
own fans and then your graphics card
can't be too long or your you're gonna
have to either remove one fan from your
a IO combo or you have to replace the
graphics card with a much smaller one
that's something you don't really have
to consider with most cases but because
the fractal design mesh by C is so
compact it's again something you will
have to keep in mind so going back to
this one again you could get the mesh by
C typical old tge you could also get
let's see the dark TG I never looked at
these prices okay cool so these are all
75 bucks it looks like it says this one
sold out honestly though I like the
transparent tge better I do not like the
dark tempered glass because then real
all you can see inside are just the the
LEDs you can't see any the components
you guys want to show off that sexy
Hardware not just the hardware LEDs that
sets my take anyway and that's why I
recommend the non Tintin tempered glass
version so that's cooler that's the one
in stock
let me see we have a mesh refinement
dark tge
this one's basically the same price I
mean there's just a little bit less just
there just slightly less materials going
to the production of these I'm just
basically two slots are so smaller from
a vertical perspective and then we also
have the white model that's what's cool
too so if you guys want a white mesh if
I see 75 bucks I think that's a pretty
good deal especially if you want a more
unique-looking
mesh if I see again with that white
exterior that the interior is still
black for the most part but you do get
that beautiful white exterior save the
grille in there I actually think I'm
gonna get I think I'm gonna get one of
these soon just to just to build in it
because again this is one of my favorite
cases it pretty much checks off all the
boxes for me when it comes to full size
it's not full size but you know ATX
builds and I think it'll look really
good on camera to be a nice system to
put in the background alright so moving
on to our last one here we have the EVGA
supernova 1000 watt g1 plus this is
definitely overkill for most builders
out there that's just my opinion but if
you are just looking for something
that's gonna be future proof for friggin
generations basically thousand watts is
gonna do that for you it's gonna run
super quiet even under severe load in
most cases you're not gonna peak 500
watts which means this will probably be
slightly inefficient for you because
again the efficiency curve for most of
these units is around a 50 percent load
so if you're under fifty percent let's
say you're consuming three hundred and
fifty Watts under a full load with
gaming let's say you're gaming and
rendering the background I don't know
usually when you're gaming you're not
even consuming anywhere close to full
system power but let's just assume
you're consuming 350 this will not be as
efficient as it would be if you were
consuming 500 watts of power it's kind
of hard to picture it that way we do
have videos talking about what power
supply fish
these actually mean but if I had a
ballpark it I'd say that if you were
consuming 350 watts of power G 180 plus
gold I believe is 90 yeah 90% efficient
92% efficient
I think this is under an optimal load of
500 Watts roughly you're gonna be around
an 80 85 and I'll put a little higher
than that close to 90% efficient I was
just still really good so if you're
worried about that and people please you
know they're sticklers about this kind
of stuff and obviously this is again
severe overkill but it's a modular power
supply it's gonna run pretty quiet
I trust EVGA power supplies for the most
part and this one again great reviews
you know they trust their products when
they got 12 year warranties it's you
know typically these are typically
10-year warranties which is it's one of
the reasons why I love UGA power
supplies but this is gonna be a great
unit for really anybody building a semi
new semi powerful system I would even
trust this in like a custom loop you
know with like three or four thousand
dollars with the gear so that's just my
take on it but 480 bucks
can't really go wrong is typically a
roughly $200 power supply so it's a heck
of a see let's see 800 watt I'm gonna ya
see the 850 watts more expensive so like
Dovie it would be stupid to buy this one
and pay more than to get the one that
that's capable of the higher wattage the
75 watt is basically the same price as a
thousand watt so again by the thousand
watt instead and the 650 watt is again
basically the same price as a thousand
watts oh it just makes everybody just it
would be dumb and in my opinion not to
buy the higher wattage unit so uh I
would get this one and for 80 bucks
again you could pretty much swap this
from system system for years and not
have a problem let's see scrolling up
Colossus says course there are M XOR mi
if you want a really quiet power supply
yeah and most of them cool fast most of
they are gonna be really quite power
supplies my ebj p2 is for example our
dead silent might be quiet power
supplies all of those are dead silent
I've had a couple course a power
supplies those were well I had one that
was cheap it was pretty loud but the
more expensive one I had I think it was
actually
I actually think it was and an RM X I'm
not mistaken that was a very quiet power
supply as well most of them are gonna be
uh if they're loud power supplies you're
gonna know about it
I actually a video coming up soon about
a particular unit actually from EVGA
that's a lot louder than I expected and
this is a pretty widespread issue we'll
talk about but I would say yeah again
this one here as far as I know G+ gonna
be very quiet system under load even if
you're not in that optimal peak
efficiency range so that is basically
nutshell what I found it was super
compelling for Cyber Monday if I've been
saying Black Friday instead you guys
know what I mean I apologize but I am
all yours now I'm looking at the chat
and if you guys have anything that you
would like to add anything you found it
was really good maybe I missed it again
I was looking at the the screen for the
most part but I want you guys to share
the knowledge if you were interested in
doing that we would appreciate it we'll
be able to throw a couple of these
products up on screen for those who are
eager to buy something within their
price range get a good deal nothing
wrong with trying to find deals nothing
wrong with that it out let's see
scrolling down yeah I see Vadim Quebec
ski hey I actually bought a 34 inch 2560
1080 Alienware monitor at 34 inch sir
and it's great for gaming sadly I got
one with the defect so I'm sending it
for a refund on ebay and getting the LG
34 you see 89 G which has identical
specs my opinion on those I have a 34
inch actually this this panel right here
behind me it's from via Tech that's a 34
inch panel and I I'm not I think when
you get up to that size I think you
should try if you can then your budget
to jump up to the 1440p 34 40 panel it's
just it's such a large screen and I know
that that 1080p like the vertical aspect
is gonna be the same whether you stretch
it or not but when you're talking about
2560 20 mm 5 or 6 pixels across
basically a 30 inch horizontal aspect
it's the resolution just really isn't
there for me
the vo-tech panel i have is a 34 inch
panel and it has
I want to say I don't remember the P P
off the top of my head but when I looked
at a couple of the the review samples
from Best Buy that they have on display
they had one it was a 34 inch LG I think
it was almost probably the same one that
you're talking about I might be the one
that Best Buy has on display I just I
got about two feet from it and I could
it just looked a little jagged to me and
when you can kind of see the the pixels
there it just tells me that the screen
is a little too big but again if you
have hardware that fits that that
resolution let's say you have a graphics
card that's perfect for 1080p maybe not
higher in 4k stuff or 1440p stuff but
good 1080p sweet spot maybe like a gtx
1060 or 1050 TI or rx5 6570 and I think
that's a that's a that's a pretty good
deal I just if I would have done that
vet him I would have said drop it 229
inches I had a 29 inch 2560 by 1080 and
that was a pretty good PPI for me not as
high as not as high as I would like
course nothing wrong with a higher ppi
as long as you can drive those pixels
but nonetheless
that was just my preference there I'm
going to scroll pull quick I think I
missed a couple other super shots let's
see yeah Victor's 22 $5 New Zealand
dollars whatever however much that is I
appreciate it victress is a good guy
he's always been supporting us he's been
pretty much every one of these live
streams hey Greg keep trying to keep
mine off a life at the moment find out
last thing my dad is dying from leukemia
my dude and has less than 60 days to
live that is a freaking rough that
that's that's rough man I didn't expect
I didn't expect to read that just now
that that I I am sorry
our prayers are with you and we do hope
your dad hope he fares through it man
that's tough that sucks my grandpa
actually has leukemia he's been doing
alright recently they put him on I don't
know if it was some experimental drug or
whatever you know the way I look at it
is like if you get a diagnosis like that
like I'll try anything you know I tell
myself I don't want to go through chemo
blah blah blah but like when you have a
family we got people you love you don't
want to leave them obviously that's just
that's a tough thing to deal with and
you know god forbid I ever have to deal
with something like that personally I
would just I'd be open to anything you
know or worst case it doesn't work out
but at least you tried and I do hope
that that your dad has some access to
two things that could possibly hear him
could help them out again 60 days to
live that's a tough diagnosis though I
must be it must be pretty pretty severe
from what it sounds like
victors I know you've you've reached a
couple times in this court I don't know
if this pertains the same thing I know I
saw a couple other comments from you in
a discord server I'll talk to you
one-on-one dude I want to chat a little
more with you about this and see what's
going on so if you want to hang out the
discord after the livestream I'm gonna
pick it right on over to to my personal
rig behind me and I'm gonna I'm gonna
jump on discord and have a chat with you
so if you got some time I'd like to do
that I like to hear more about it just
sometimes it helps to talk about it so
if that's something that that we would
like to do think it would help I I'd
love to sit down with you so I just let
me know let's see venom says terrible
input lag it's really bad on OLED yep
John are there any SSD deals you all
know about John literally just went
through SSDs - check out the links below
to answer your question it's rolling
down let's see but Papa so see war man 1
3 2 4 - don't let super chat my dude
anyone used an OLED screen - game oh
that's where I came from
good or bad I think it really depends on
the OLED OLED screens are going to have
higher input lag it really it depends
but in general they will they'll have
higher input lag especially when
compared to something like a TN panel
but I'm not sure how severe that is
going to be it's just a that's a tough
that's a tough I don't know I really
like OLED screen so I think they look
really great when it comes to phones I
basically can't choose a phone that
doesn't have an OLED screen anymore
which is why I'm so glad that the pixel
3 hasn't all that screen because if it
didn't then I honestly it'd be really
tough for me to recommend just in 2018
it just makes more sense
for the mobile side of things you know
when you're streaming or whatever you
have like the the screen on always at
night like all that stuff is just
complemented by an OLED panel so that's
my take on it
my name is Jeff at science studio that's
what's up bro that's why we come back a
little love and prayers go a long way
just like with the hurricane that's
right I'm a man and to be honest you
know my parents they we've basically I
say we I've helped them three or four
times Lisa and I go over there and try
to help demo the house
it's basically completely gutted now and
they are living in a gutted house it's
it's crazy to think about you know if
you had told me this was gonna happen a
year ago I probably laughs just because
it's like you know I'm in my own little
world they're in our world and it's like
that that stuff can't happen you can't
picture that stuff happening but but
they're in it right now like they are
experiencing it firsthand
and then when you realize that it's not
just them it's like they're there's so
many people living in the same under the
same conditions right now because their
house was either completely wiped out or
their roof got destroyed and everything
inside flooded that was something that I
hinted at in my satire studio video
regarding FEMA's response to Hurricane
Michael I talked about how my parents
house was gonna be a total loss and it
was deemed a total loss by their
insurance company because the roof was
but it had holes everywhere and when you
have holes in your roofs then what
happens is the water either floods your
attic and then your ceiling starts
falling apart piece by piece
and then your flooring starts getting
destroyed and all the components and
furniture on the floor gets destroyed or
the water sinks down and follows the
rafters all the two-by-fours all the
studs down into the walls and it sinks
into the walls then it gets soaked up by
the insulation and then the insulation
gets all moldy it gets nasty it's
literally unlivable because if you did
live in there then you'd probably
contract something pretty serious and
when we were gutting a couple of rooms I
mean that the insulation was just so
disgusting it was all black and moldy
and and still damp believe it or not
just cuz it's been sealed off from
everything else in the environment cuz
it's sitting between brick and drywall
you know
so yeah it's it's tough okay I didn't
mean for this chat to turn super
negative or anything it's just you know
that's the state of affairs right now
and I know that the you know I know that
our city is the only city going through
anything serious right now I know the
California's been do some serious
wildfires from the past month or so
people totally lost everything there I
would argue that a fire is probably is
worse than a hurricane if the fire
destroys literally everything in your
home at least in a hurricane
you got some to an extent you got a
warning you can get out we didn't have
much of a warning at all in fact we had
a mandatory evacuation announced two
days before the storm hit so whether you
want to call that enough time or not to
give you some context people were still
working in my city the night before the
hurricane hit because their employers
either wouldn't let them go or I mean
you know business is business you're
just you're just living day by day and
when your last minute told you get out
of a city because this is your category
five hurricane is gonna hit you
you know I changes everything and a lot
of people can't keep up that or they
just decide to brace it head-on you know
and try to save as much as they can and
then with a fire you know good gosh how
do you stop a huge wildfire I can't
imagine I've never been in the middle of
a wildfire I hope I never am but again
that's total destruction I mean how do
you how do you salvage stuff that's
burned like that you can't do that you
might be able to salvage some stuff
that's wet that gets soaked by water
maybe ocean water to rainwater whatever
but when it's burned by a fire it's gone
so a lot of people lost a lot of things
there so you gonna keep all those people
everyone affected by these storms by
these just natural disasters even
man-made events just you know remember
that people are going through some rough
stuff you know and remember to be
grateful for what you have even if you
don't they don't feel like you had a lot
you could probably have less than you
have and that's the reason to be
grateful so just uh yeah a little deep
thought for for the day from science
studio which I'm sure you don't hear
very much but yeah let's see I want to
see some good stuff folks to see Brian
Schulz at science studio I've had a
fractal no 202 did a review and I'm
wondering if I can use
that power supply in a normal ATX case
will it fit okay good question Brian
actually those power supplies are sfx
form factor which means that they are
not going to fit the conventional ATX
mounting bracket if you will on the back
of most ATX cases assuming in this case
is support ATX power supplies you will
need a an adapter basically it's a
bracket that connects the mounting
points for a typical ATX power supply
onto a small form-factor power supply
and sfx power supply so if you get that
adapter just type in ATX to sfx power
supply bracket on like new acre amazon
I'm sure you'll find something shouldn't
be too expensive it's just a piece of
plastic or metal that kind of screws
into your case and that is how you can
take that power supply and throw it into
an ATX build a good question though
that's a really good question okay let's
see some good stuff
go fastest is buying a power supply
that's twice as efficient twice as big
as what you need is wasting your money
because those are very efficient at idle
ok Co fossa I don't think you understand
how how inefficient it actually is
actually only maybe two three percent
less efficient as if you were running it
under an optimal load I invite you to
watch our power efficiencies and what
they mean literally what they mean we
talked about the graphs we translate
every variable and how to interpret and
determine how efficient your power
supply is under any given load they are
not extremely inefficient if you're
running them at 350 Watts versus 500
Watts if you're talking about $1,000
power supply and most thousand dollar
power supplies are going to be 80 plus
gold or higher and the reason why is
because if you have an 80 plus or
something that's not even rated 80 then
you're losing your basically your net
loss and power is that much greater
because we're talking about higher power
draw overall so if you're pulling 500
watts from the wall you might only be
sending 400 watts to your system well
that's a pretty crappy conversion rate
it's only 80% only 80% efficient but if
you're talking about 90% efficient with
a thousand watt power supply that's a
hundred watts or so if you're assuming
that you're pulling full thousand watts
now but if you're in the peak efficiency
range they're roughly five hundred watts
let's just assume for the sake of
arguments five hundred watts then what
that means is if your system is drawing
five hundred not then you're going to
probably pull slightly more than five
hundred from the wall you're what you
will pull for more than five hundred
from the wall no system is perfectly
efficient you're gonna pull maybe you
could do this mathematically but you're
gonna pull slightly more than that
based on that efficiency factor and
again it depends whether or not you have
a gold or a platinum or a titanium or
silver bronze or doesn't matter it all
varies but I would not say that getting
a power supply's a thousand watts is a
waste of money especially when they're
cheaper than the lower wattage power
supplies to me that's kind of kind of a
dumb thing to say that's just my take on
that look if you're if your scissors
only gonna consume 150 watts power then
please don't buy down my powers but it's
not what I'm saying but you would be
perfectly fine running a thousand watt
power supply in a system that consumes
300 to 400 watts of power under
optimal load that's all I'm saying there
I do it I'm doing it right now on both
of my machines and I guarantee I'm not
losing much more unless they're just
their efficiencies went way out of whack
since I installed them it's perfectly
fine not something to freak out freak
out freak out about and for that price
jeez that's a heck of a price for those
let's see knock disc good question here
what are your thoughts on the i7 9700 k
I will answer that question in a
dedicated video very very soon my friend
just stay tuned for that I watched your
video already what I meant is that the
efficiency plummets a lot under 20%
because it might be tenant wimps in well
okay yeah Co fossa but that assumes that
you're only consuming 200 watts power
under load most systems are can assume
well over 200 watts power
I wouldn't say they'll consume well over
300 watts of power when you're gaming
probably not I mean you're probably
gonna be under it depends again on your
hardware but I would say around 300
watts but when you're like I said under
10% yeah sure it's gonna be super
inefficient and will put a lot of strain
on your power supply believe it or not
not advised maybe I read that at a
context but that's just I just want to
make sure that you guys understand I'm
not recommending you put a thousand watt
power supply a system that consumes a
hundred watts of power that would be
insane and dumb and probably unsafe
anyway let's see here Jason says I
missed a super chat let me see Jason I
gotcha my dude I got you Jason Acevedo I
saw you waiting in the chat dude you
were waiting here like an hour and a
half ago like you were you were a
trooper I appreciate your diligence
there my dude he says I have an EVGA
supernova 750 be 80 plus bronze power
supply
powering 8700 K and a 1080 TI
overclocked with an 80 plus gold power
supply be worth while upgrade no you
could probably work this out
mathematically again I would need a
piece paper and pencil because I'm not a
freaking genius but the difference
between 80 plus bronze and 80 plus gold
let me just do a quick Google search I
got a refresh my memory
PSU efficiency 80 plus chart just so I
can kind of set this up for you so 80
plus bronze let's assume you have a 50%
load you
750 watt power supply and you're running
an 8700 K and a 1080i overclocked so
you're you're gonna consume around let's
say 150 watts on your CPU and 250 on
your 1080 TI that just just throwing
this out there that's 400 watts let's
say for all intensive purposes that 400
watts is half of your power supply is
rated wattage it's 750 butts assume 800
so for 80 plus bronze system 80 plus
bronze rating that means that a 50%
you're going to be 85% efficient right
so if you're drawing for if we're not
drawing but if your power supply is
sending 400 watts to your components and
it's going to consume slightly more than
that right and then if you are running
on a gold system and you're at 90%
you're going to consume slightly less
then then that 80 plus bronze power
supply from the wall and that's assuming
again that it is slightly more efficient
having 80 plus gold reigning rating over
an 80 plus bronze the difference there
would be arguably depending on how much
you use your system a few bucks a year
if that I mean maybe a few bucks I'm on
that I might be over exaggerating that
but I would say no it's not worth it in
a nutshell I probably should've just
said that at the beginning but if you're
really wondering about science behind it
all you to do is just take the 80 plus
rating the efficiency at your load and
then do 1 minus the efficiency over the
efficiency or maybe say the way around
and then you can calculate how much
power your point from the raw wall for
any given 80 plus rating and then you
can see the difference the difference in
wattage between each efficiency rating
and then you can decide that way you'd
probably have to run your system 24/7
for a few months before it ever became
worth it from a price perspective and
that again is assuming that you could
even resell your old power supply and
get some of your money back to cut into
your margins so again yeah you could
work this all out mathematically I'm
just saying that from my perspective up
front it's probably not worth it I
wouldn't freak out about it
I like your system you know how much
power supply's wasn't like really loud
or something anyway
Sebastian keeps asking if I've used any
Synology product the answer is no I have
not I don't even know what that is to be
frank
let's see here bench potato have you
ever used Amazon
house recommended not first hand
I have not although I know many people
who have look the fact is I know the
people that that have used Amazon
warehouse are still using Amazon
warehouse to an extent at least and so
that's probably saying something what's
up mister KF gaming you were looking
mighty fine with those four gold stars
by your name that's because he's a
member I do appreciate your membership
mr. KF gaming you're one of the first
members ever on science to do and I will
never ever forget that so thank you very
much David hua should I get a Vega 64
for 399 David you should like we
literally talked about this in our
livestream so you should probably check
the video description it's literally
linked to there as well it's kind of
really say the same things we just
talked about I get it he's no it's okay
I know stress master at science studio
don't buy ultra anything they basically
closed their doors and there is no
warranty don't buy ultra anything I'm
confused what do you mean ultra anything
that's weird I think I read that out of
context possibly I need you to clarify
please clarify John must know what my
favorite color is it's probably white
I'm just kidding
it's like if I had a pick a legit color
or not white which is like arguably
blend of every color I would say it's
tough I think my favorite color is red
because red is powerful it's like it's
it's provoking you know you see people
wear like ties like guys are pretty
serious about their ties right so you
see a guy wearing a blue tie he might be
a nice guy see you guy wearing a red tie
well he's important that's just like
that's just my first thought when I see
a guy in a red tie I'm like okay he's
taking it seriously
you know BC guy in a blue tie or a
purple tie or whatever it just doesn't
convey the same message to me I think it
just comes down to like a psychological
thing but that's why they call red like
the power tie you know when you have red
ties so that color just because it is so
powerful from that perspective I'd have
to say red and that's probably cliche
because I'm sure a lot of people have
red as their favorite color but maybe
I'm unique in the way that I express the
fact that it's my favorite
let's see
magic says dark purple is strong too
just like your desktop behind you yeah
darn yeah purple is a good color and I
would say normally that purple is my
favorite color but the reason why I'm
not saying that is because purple is I
think it depends on the shade of purple
right I think a deeper purple like a
more true tone like just like hard
purple like if you had a picture a hard
purple you would think a dark purple
right I think that colors were really
nice color I'd probably choose that over
any red but when you think of red apart
from like venturing in a like paying
territory which I think that just
becomes pink at that point you know you
can turn from purple to violet and then
it just becomes less powerful in my
opinion and then when you look at red
you can have royal red you can go darker
with the read all those Reds are gonna
look really strong in my eyes and that's
probably why I think red is just overall
a better pick just mine just my think in
there well let's hear Josh ash what
monitor like do I currently use I
currently use via tech I want to say
it's a 34 word
Jian Jian 34c oh gosh I talked about it
in a video a long time ago it was about
refresh rates I want to say but it's
from via Tech it's link down below I
think if it's not linked down below and
like the the my tech stuff section then
I will do that after this livestream
ends but it's a really great panel
I also have an Asus PG 27 PG 27 Pete I
don't remember the PG 27 something
anyway it's a 27-inch 165 Hertz TN Asus
panel you know with g-sync
and it was one that I bought myself
before I could get a lot of review
samples and stuff I was just spitting
out money to buy all this crap and I
bought this panel for like yeah I want
to say 800 bucks 700 bucks this was back
when these panels first came out and I
wanted a serious gaming panel because I
knew how beautiful high refresh rate
gaming was
and so I just bit the bullet got one of
these I was debating the IPS variant but
ultimately I was just I was more
concerned with the fluidity right and I
knew TM was gonna be slightly better in
that regard I wouldn't have as much of a
to worry about with respect to ghosting
and response time so that was why I went
with TN and honestly it's a really good
TN panel I say just this panel right
here that I'm looking at for the stream
but uh let's see Hamad asked t-inverse
VA come on I have a video talking about
that specifically you guys ask a lot of
good questions but we have a lot of I
think good videos on the channel in the
minute science and crash course playlist
I talk about a lot of this stuff so if
you want to check that out I encourage
you I think you'll learn something if
you have that question you might learn
something new about the technologies and
how they work John Watson said same
thing t-inverse VA vs. IPS literally a
video on that topic
let's see but Sebastian have you used
the mesh router I used Google I used to
Google Wi-Fi Google home whatever they
call it the Google routers I had a mash
network set up at my parents house and
then when we moved into our old
apartment Lisa and I we we ditched the
mesh network thing which there's no
point we don't really need a mesh
because our forum it's pretty small and
then we moved into this place now I have
fiber and I'm just running the AC or the
ACC's I'm running the AT&amp;amp;T router right
now just because I I i was running I was
running it as a pass-through to my
Google Wi-Fi router but it just doesn't
I mean it wasn't doing anything for him
actually was kind of shit was kind of
choking on the connection because we're
getting a gig up gig down I think it was
a little too much for it so we're just
running straight up from the 18 T router
and I don't have any problems at all
with it and again full coverage
everywhere in the apartments only like a
1200 square foot apartment so it's not
very big but it gets the job done for
our again small space so no need really
for a super no need for a mesh someone
says you missed a super chair I didn't
miss a super chat Legion I was just
talking I will get to it right now
q in Vegas donated $1.99 do the super
chat for some reason Q in Vegas decided
to short me one penny and make it an
even $2.00 so I'm a little bit
right now I'm just joking he says help
new-build gaming editing 87 okay 1080 TI
2k limit I think you could probably work
out I mean you could work out the rest
of the details there I don't want to I'm
not gonna part through every single
thing for you but 8700 K is definitely a
good start I think a 1080 Ti is
definitely a good investment I would
choose that in my opinion feeding it
when cheaper than RT x 2080 it's a
better investment even though it's not
the most up-to-date hardware it's gonna
perform just fine in most games and if
you have a 2k budget it depends on where
you live I'm assuming you live in the
States because that's really the only
price structure I understand right now
um get yourself a 700 watt power supply
get yourself 16 gigs of ram like the RAM
kit we have linked in the description
buy that kit
get yourself a Z 370 motherboard that
doesn't cost more than about a hundred
fifty bucks
most of the overclocking benefits with
the higher-end boards aren't gonna
really see themselves to fruition it's
just the power delivery not is really
more relevant when it comes to the
higher power draw CPUs as in X to 99 and
arguably 9900 K territory and then one
terabyte hard drive 250 or 500 gig SSD
or in Batou and then a case and that's
totally subjective and that's that's it
that's all you need
there's your system I'm not gonna tell
you specifically what to buy again I
none of this stuff by the way that I've
showed in this video or in this
livestream I wasn't paid to show any of
it I'm not there's no sponsor in this
video at all this is just stuff that I
found scrolling through that I think is
a good deal if I was in the market for
any of this stuff obviously this would
be the first stuff I would buy because
it's such it's so compelling from a
price perspective so let's see Brian
Schulz 1080 or 1080i it's kind of a
vague question I know you're I need
another context what games what
resolution what settings all they get
stuff it's it's too vague as it is let's
see axel
so Borg I did I read that right I
totally probably butchered that last
name I'm sorry hey Greg I've had softube
water cooling before and recently went
back to air but now I want a water cool
again I have a 1070 and r7 1700 is it
worth going for a good hard tube water
loop or not alright
the worth aspect of it again is kind of
subjective if you have the budget for
and you're into the stuff you think it's
really exciting I don't think there's a
problem with
if you invest in the hardware invest in
the custom loop gear then you're gonna
have you know you're gonna be able to
recycle pretty much all your blocks
unless something cracks or whatever I've
had blocks recycled I've used like the
same cpu blocks in like seven builds and
they're all perfectly fine
same with graphics here are blocks I
have some graphics cards that are still
on water blocks just because I haven't
haven't needed to use them but if I want
to use one of those cards in a custom
loop it's a piece of cake
so yeah it's not not really too big an
issue and then yeah so if you're willing
to bite the bullet up front on the price
you're gonna spend an excess of $1,000
probably on water cooling gear if you
want to go all out but again you can
take that stuff and you can keep using
it over and over so all you have to do
at that point basically is by ptg tubing
if you want to do hard tubing or acrylic
whatever I would I would argue in favor
of ptg personally and that's it so from
then on out you could pretty much just
you know let your imagination run wild
with respect to what you want to build
there so yeah now if you're debating it
if you if you have a budget for it
obviously you're probably that would
make sense if you're debating it then
yeah I'd say go for it ek alpha cool
primo chill BitFenix any of those brands
are really great I've worked with all of
them so you know I wouldn't be worried
too much with respect to who I go with
just how much I want to spend and
ultimately the bend you know they're the
loop itself
what I wanted to look like and the parts
that weren't involved mr. KF gaming
what's going on my dude again mr. K of
gaming I want to say this again he was
one of the first members ever on the
channel and I do appreciate his support
membership cost like five bucks you
don't really get anything too exciting
but you get cool little badges next to
him to indicate your seniority that
you're a member you can see mr. KF
gaming has four stars next to his name
that's meaning that means he's been a
contributor on the channel for over
three months over four months I want to
say it's over four months which is
really impressive and I do appreciate
that from the bottom of my heart mr. KF
gaming and again thank you for your
super chat as well $5 super chat he says
I've been absent from the comments and
live chats lately so for my apology take
my money well I'm just been taking your
money already mr. K forgive me I do hope
you feel like it is worth it yeah I
don't do you know
anything too special with the members
but I do try to call them out when I see
them and thank them for for just taking
time to help us out financially really
just go a long way I think we only have
like 20 or 30 members on the channel so
it's not like we're raking in dough but
it just gives me an opportunity to thank
personally over and over the members
when I see them because it's just like
it said it's not obligatory at all
there's something mandatory about it
it's just people who want to support us
in that way it is appreciated let's see
a tour for for once it's hello everyone
what is going on mine dude okay okay
let's see here random gamer thanks one
more question any good deals on an i7
8700 K not really no I think they're
selling right now for like 350 bucks
slightly less than that I think new bike
hasn't for like 335 or something along
those lines and Amazon is comparable so
I did this again Ty's partly into the
inventory issues the supplies been
slightly shorted Intel's been struggling
this for quite a while which is why
prices went up for a period of time for
Intel CPUs they've come down slightly
and they kind of bakit they're like a
fair price but in my opinion 8700 K
should be around 300 bucks slightly less
than that would be a super sweet deal
but this is until we're talking about I
wouldn't expect anything crazy from them
let's see Jedi kv any IPS freesync deals
you should check out my black friday
video it's the last video on the channel
and you should yeah I think you'll
you'll find a couple we talked about in
there from pic Co a brand that I've
actually grown to love recently because
pic Co is I mean it's a company probably
never heard of but they actually make
some pretty sweet panels and I love the
fact that you don't have ghosting or
anything else of the sort for the most
part when it comes to new pixi of panels
I haven't had an issue at all with them
we have a new member what's going on run
B of run buff run by no I don't know how
to say that run Bob diver diver that's
cool alright that's a slightly awkward
moment here but I appreciate it thank
you very much now everyone else can see
that you are
remember and you'll get a cool little
badge next to your name now I hope you
feel special and if it anyway again that
I can make you guys feel a little more
special I know we have to add emotes and
stuff that's kind of like how to which
does their thing but if you guys have
ideas for that kind of stuff
that would be appreciated I can put
something together
if someone else wants to put some
something together then that would be
cool and then we could use those you
guys could post cool little emotes and
stuff to make yourself stand out a
little more from the chat I think that'd
be a cool way again to just kind of
differentiate you guys from the rest of
the viewers although I do appreciate
everyone watching right now that some
430 or so watching very thankful for all
of you especially on the Sunday night /
Monday depending on where you live on
planet earth stress master 500 super
chat again I appreciate that stress
master I saw your question earlier but I
didn't understand what you're asking he
says he used to be a tiger direct
company oh but with sold three times and
is now closed I've seen ultra products
for sale on Black Friday stuff oh gosh
yeah especially if you have to worry
about the this was this is one of the
issues with the with ncx I'm sure when
NCIX went down but if you buy a product
right through that company and then that
said company just gets dissolved or goes
bankrupt or whatever and they can't
fulfill their obligations anymore as a
company then the buyers of those
products are kind of SOL because now you
can't go back to the vendor for a refund
or for an RMA or whatever if you've had
a rebate coming in through that company
good luck I mean good luck in general
with rebates but you know what I mean
and if the company is just being bought
out by all these other companies and
their reputations just been kind of on
the edge I'm not sure with respect to
ultra I haven't dealt specifically with
them a long time then you probably want
to shop elsewhere it's probably the safe
bet just something to consider
let's see yeah exactly so I says no
service if the company closes and that's
the risk we all take I mean like Amazon
could go under tomorrow I highly doubt
that but if Amazon did and we all had
prime memberships and we were like in
the middle of watching a super killer
series on Amazon video and we'd all be
screwed assuming there's servers and all
that were seized and liquidated and all
that stuff yeah everything in life to an
extent is a risk it's just how risky do
you want to be
my friend let's see Baba let's see here
Lisa hey Lisa what are you doing the
chat she's supposed to be playing video
games but she's in the chat right now
that's right Sebastian everything has a
risk Hamad Al Shabab best cheapest for
144 Hertz VA panel I mean you could just
go on Amazon type in 144 Hertz VA and
then just sort from lowest to highest
that's one way you could do this and
just kind of work your way down toward
products to have better reviews in
general you super chatted me what oh you
did you super chatted me eh
Lisa said why did you
you just gave ourselves money uh can we
get a sloshy from Sonic do you want to
get a slushie from Sonic right now she
wants to get to slushie from Sonic I
think that's my cue
I think this is her way of telling me to
get off the live stream no we're having
such a good time over here you guys are
asking good questions as always I saw a
new member queue in Vegas that's like I
asked a question earlier as well queuing
I do appreciate that as a member you
will pretty much get badges and like
that's really about it but I want you
guys to feel special I'm gonna give you
guys personal shout outs maybe we'll do
like Members Only Live streams at some
point when I have slightly more time on
my hands I'm not helping my parents so
much and doing things with Lisa while
she's here
but that that's something that I want to
do and again no more you guys do this I
feel even more compelled I should feel
compelled from the get-go especially
when it comes to people like KF gaming
Cody salak is our moderator spam of the
discord link right now I'm glad he's
doing that you guys join the public
discord if you have not already I do
appreciate it again Cody you've been an
awesome mod so have you could FAFSA you

nothing wrong with video games right
and if you guys want to play along with
myself or Lisa or Brian or Will or
whoever is on the live not live but
whoever's on the discord that would be
cool that would be very cool if you
would be a cool kid so if you want to be
a cool kid click that link and you guys
can be getting me cool kids it's
literally that easy yeah mm-hmm yeah I
did Lisa just make her channel she
probably did just make her channel I
have no idea if she didn't have a
channel beforehand then yeah that would
explain why she hasn't her subs if she
did have a channel beforehand she
probably do anything on it and that's
why nobody knew who she was but anyway
we're gonna be a slushies now you guys
have been dope I appreciate the
memberships for those of you who joined
run buff diver and Q in Vegas you guys
are awesome I do hope you stick around
you can turn that big star into multiple
stars if you decide to become renewing
members of science studio that is
awesome again I'll get some icons and
emotes out soon I know you guys deserve
that stuff I just need to get on the
ball maybe I'll just open it up to you
guys to create some cool stuff if you
want to use them in the chats for
everyone watching right now they're
roughly 400 or so of you I appreciate it
