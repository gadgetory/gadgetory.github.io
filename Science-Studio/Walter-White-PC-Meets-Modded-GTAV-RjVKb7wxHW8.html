wringer in my opinion this is like the
apex of the Z 170 experience you could
put something like a 1080 in here but
for what I do and pretty much the games
I play at 1070 is just fine and I'm
going to show you that here with the new
Redux mod for GTA 5 GTA 5 was already a
very beautiful game to begin with I
didn't have any complaints in terms of
how things looked in game i love the
just the action scenes the explosions
everything was fairly realistic but this
mod takes things to an entirely
different level I'm very satisfied with
so far i'm going to show you guys first
hand here it is so here you have it
folks this is the Redux mod for GTA 5 if
you don't play gt5 a lot you might not
notice the immediate differences but i
play it quite a bit and right off the
bat i just this really does change just
the overall feel of the game everything
just seems so much more real look at the
depth these little dust specks or
whatever they are now this adds to the
the depth in the game it makes you feel
like you're immersed in Los Santos which
is just lovely the first thing I want to
do is take you to the top so we're at
the top of the tallest building here in
Los Santos much can let you look out
just at the differences it really does
look different folks I think I'm in love
this this view right here it already
looked great in the vanilla version that
wow this redox mod takes things to a
whole nother level now speaking of
attention to detail my take it right
here under this freeway I can't believe
I just made it through that but I'm
gonna Park it right here in the middle
of traffic that seems fitting and i want
to show you just just the road okay look
at how realistic this road looks check
this out this all of this just looks
more real and i can tell you look at
that look at the concrete their
attention to detail that I think that is
the best description of the Redux mod
attention to detail it is spot-on now as
for Walter White how well is he holding
up right now
here's the thing okay this is why i'm
also using a lapel microphone instead of
the the blue yeti this mod has a few
issues in terms of how it allocates
resources as far as i'm aware and as a
result i can't run any significant
programs in the background now shadow
play is running no problem but things
like audacity and fraps would not allow
the game to run smoothly and a few
instances the game just crashed all
together so i resorted to just using a
lapel microphone but the good thing is
you can still use shadow play I don't
know about OBS I haven't I haven't tried
that out I don't personally use OBS 4
for 4 gameplay recording but the good
thing is it is stable if you're willing
to make a few compromises this is very
taxing on your system again I can't see
frame rates because fraps isn't open but
I can tell you we are yeah certainly
receiving more than 60 frames per second
here this is much smoother than 60 and
my settings right now I pretty much very
high or maxed out with two times
anti-aliasing and I believe I believe
that sit there are no advanced graphics
settings activate at this point but no
no let's go ahead and do that actually
let's go ahead and turn out that
extended distance scaling that have a
buff things up and extended shadows why
not high detail while flying on high
resolution shadows long shadows sure
okay everyone that you'll see that pop
up on the top left that's just kind of a
state of mind Wow whoa I feel like I
just changed like I feel like I just
completely swapped skins or something
for the game what is this probably looks
so great Walter White is thus far
handling the advanced graphics settings
being turned on or maxed out and things
are looking lovely folks check that out
look at those viewing distances I've
noticed in the vanilla version of GTA 5
that turning things up like high detail
while flying and extended distance
scaling things like that really didn't
change much like when I'm trying to
snipe somebody from you know a mile away
or so turning that on didn't it
ance the image at all it still looked
fairly blurry but I think here I think
this really does make a difference so if
your computer can handle the advanced
graphics being turned on I suggest doing
that for this mod very evident
improvement right away let's jump out
now okay I'm sorry if I sound annoying
I'm just this really does look great I
recommend if you have the horsepower and
your computer I recommend installing
this mod without a doubt look how smooth
that paint job is while the rims look a
little strange but a apart from that
just this this feels like GTA 6 it
really does it doesn't feel like GTA 5
anymore the signs look at the detail and
the signs Wow now it does look like we
have nuclear fallout kind of floating
everywhere you can try out some of the
new shadow packs they have if you follow
the the guidelines that our shadow packs
you can install apart from the regular
redux shadow pack that'll change things
for you change the aura the color hues
all that stuff look at the sand the
people another thing characters look
more real look at my face look how I
mean it doesn't look much better but you
can tell a difference so even you know
facial features characters within the
game have been improved that water looks
real it looked fairly real beforehand
but that looks that looks good let's go
underwater I'm going to be able to go
underwater
so it's more subdued so you can see the
water is not really moving very much Wow
the reflections look good the
reflections look really good so a few
quirks my guy looks like he's kind of I
don't know what he looks like he's doing
it was looking swimming but yeah and the
water doesn't look like it's moving
around me just kinda looks like I'm
going through the water it looks fairly
real when you start running through it
swimming fast through it though okay so
two more things I want to do first up
we're going to go to the beach and we're
going to see how how much different the
beach looks because I think that's a
unique environment within GTA 5 so we'll
go there and then we'll go somewhere in
the back country somewhere where there's
a lot of grass because grass is very
taxing on just the whole system in
general in GTA 5 so I want to see how
Walter White handles that it already was
crippled I mean frame rates were
practically cut in half with grass and
vanilla GTA so I'm expecting about the
same result in this case the Redux mod
doesn't seem to be taxing the GPU any
more than it already was being taxed
with vanilla this is going to sound
weird but the sunlight looks more real
this isn't the placebo effect folks I
promise there are definite improvements
here like i said i played gt5 a lot if
you don't believe me try it out for
yourself you will see an improvement but
yeah there are a lot of things that just
look so much better let's go back up in
the sky really like looking down at the
city from above with this redux mod look
at that water look at that water Wow oh
yeah oh yeah I already know I already
know it looks like someone just filmed
this and then threw it into a game well
that's kind of a rough landing oh yeah
big difference I don't know if it's so
much the water as it is the water
reflections the reflections are just
spot-on so this kind of a gruesome way
to do it the Fire doesn't look much
different and really bother changing
that not really surprised though fires
that's fairly difficult to the program
just look at that flag I wonder if that
looks the same in vanilla
doubted that flag looks pretty darn good
again you can definitely see the nuclear
fallout okay i don't know what the sun
is doing i thought it went down already
that's strange something I'm going to
bail out right over this little swamp
area here here we go okay so very grassy
area and something is going on outside
what's going on inside and it's actually
doing well Walter White's handling
himself alright again it's not bright I
know that will make a difference when
you have the Sun up you see the shadows
from the grass that practically doubles
the intensive scenario but I will say
yeah I'm not seeing any sharp
performance cuts with the mod which is
great regardless Walter White is
handling himself admirably even at this
point when being surrounded by a bunch
of grass which as we all know is very
taxing so that's it folks if you
appreciate the video give it a thumbs up
I just I felt like this was worthy of a
video this really does change the game
for GTA 5 if you play gt5 a lot I don't
blame you consider downloading and
installing this mod it will make a
difference it'll make it feel like GTA 6
i'm not kidding when i say that it feels
like a totally different game even
though the map hasn't changed at all so
yeah check it out in the video
description the link to the Redux mod
itself as well as the installation guide
subscribe if you haven't already for
more stuff like this we're going to do
another pc build here shortly stay tuned
for that one this is science to do
thanks for learning with this and thanks
for bearing with my new lapel microphone</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
