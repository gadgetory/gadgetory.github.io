team group suite it's super crowded we
might not fill most of our primary role
here you'll see mostly b-roll no one's
gonna argue with tech porn and it's
great that it's crowded it means that
people are interested in what they're
doing is working so we have a few new
modules to show off our GB SSD is that I
have yet to get to but I will be
including them and build and actually
reviewing that SSD very soon as a
dedicated video stay tuned for all that
but for now check out the b-roll and
we'll introduce the new products
starting right now well I guess we're
gonna give it a shot in here I apologize
if the noise may be a new mic next year
but first I want to start with the new
xcalibur and ddr4 he's using Samsung be
dice you know they're the best in the
business gonna get the best overclock
out of these and I love the diffusion
here they've done with the lighting RGB
of course and if you want the special
version but it literally looks like a
sword from the top so if you're into
some sort of like medieval fame in
particular these modules are the ones
for you now as I said in our previous
computation 118 coverage I really like
it when multiple companies work together
to make a very cohesive working unit and
when you can make it look aesthetically
pleasing as well I'm all for it we're
talking tough gaming Alliance ddr4 from
Team Group synced up perfectly with a
tough gaming asus motherboard and if you
remember the deep cool cooler as well
had a tough gaming accent so maybe
you've hair all three together a nice
black and orange color scheme looking
pretty good in the neighborhood also if
you're wondering why I have this camera
with me pretty much everywhere this is
our b-roll camera so after we do a shot
like this warm a behind the scenes tip I
usually film a couple shots of b-roll so
if I mess up in primary I can just
overlap it with b-roll and do my best to
splice the waveforms and it should sound
pretty crispy and post now this is the
t-one 83 um
Steve flashdrive hundred and
twenty-eight gig of storage in this
particular model comes in a dark grey
and a silver and it's not just a
thumbdrive
if you're interested in something like
this I carry one on my keychain but it
only is sad just a storage drive this
one also opens beer bottles or whatever
other bottle requires a bottle opener
crack open a cold one with the boys
this one will let you do it you can also
measure with this thing it has a ruler
and an exit into the top of it and you
can also open boxes with it yeah that's
right a built-in box over so maybe I can
replace my i3 7350 with this finally
something more effective than the CPU
that I never use anymore now here are
the RGB SSDs you get to see them on my
channel it's the first time I've shown
them I do have one back home but I
wasn't able to build with it in time
before I left for Computex and and
Europe for other things so this is the
first time I've seen them in person and
they actually look really good so
they've done a great job again diffusing
the light this is the largest surface
area of RGB you'll find on an SSD to
date these are 5 volt powered via
dedicated USB looks like micro USB port
there on the bottom left and the best
part is these are all addressable RGB
LEDs so you can actually run really cool
designs if you have an SSD tray let's
say that sitting on top of a basement or
in front of a basement then this will
definitely come in handy it'll look nice
and snazzy a it's just an extra RGB
component even if you don't want it to
do you know the whole rainbow effect
send it to white set it to blue whatever
you want and just lock the color scheme
that's the whole point of RGB so if
you're questioning this right now in
your head like why would anyone want
this just remember there are many people
out there what seven plus billion people
in the world everyone has a unique
preference and that's what RGB allows
you to do is sculpt your component to
your color preference so this has been
the team group suite I'm glad they got a
largest wheat this year they definitely
needed it people I've been flooding this
place and we've struggled to find space
to even film b-roll so that's a good
thing I don't I don't blame them for
having you know a lot of traffic in
their suite that's a good thing
definitely and what we've realized is
that
look they're not afraid to step out of
the comfort zone when it comes to an
aesthetic approach right to ram the
excalibur ddr4 lineup is definitely an
example of that the RAM modules
themselves with like nothing else on the
market and they're bold enough to make a
step like that to throw these products
into the market and to just cross their
fingers and hope that people catch on to
the designs end of the new trend RGB is
definitely hot right now
I love seeing those with all the modules
basically that team group has to offer
and even if you don't want RGB or any
LEDs at all for that matter like you can
pick yourself up some stuff that's not
RGB capable right so you you have
multiple color options multiple RGB LED
options stuff that has none of that at
all but it still clocks extremely high
using the premium dyes from companies
like micron Hynix the Samsung Samsung B
dies in the latest stuff DX caliber ddr4
stay tuned we'll have links updated
below by the way if you want to enter
for a chance to win an RGB SSD which I
still think is just crazy beyond belief
not sure if I'm totally on board yet but
I think I will be once I build with one
then check out the link below the very
top link you can enter to win your very
own R GB SSD this has been science to do
thanks for checking out the team grip
