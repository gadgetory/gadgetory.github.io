go Nabisco is not a sponsor of this
video but I do love cheese nips so this
video is going to do is refine the $800
ITX PC build that we built a few weeks
ago it's in one of these cards I don't
one of these sides I don't know which
side it's on but check out that video if
you haven't already eight hundred bucks
we built a very solid 1080p and even
light 1440p ITX gaming PC this video is
going to seek to refine that a bit but
negatively because we only have six
hundred dollars in our budget this time
I'm not going to build this PC because
I've already built a better version of
it but I can say with certainty through
this game this computer will be able to
run games in 1080p no problem even in
high settings thanks to the components
we've selected so I've used PC part
picker here and that's because it's very
easy to see the price breakdowns each of
the parts and where you can buy them for
the cheapest and I also have every part
that I talked about in this video linked
in this video's description
most of those are Amazon affiliate links
or just new a get their Amazon links
they are tied to my associate account so
if you buy something via that link it
doesn't have to be the part in
particular I do get a small kickback for
that I don't make any secret at it so if
you guys are interested in purchasing
anything on Amazon using any of those
links would definitely send me a smaller
kickback it adds it up it just keeps
things going for me I do appreciate all
those contributions even if it's not
you're not directly giving me money but
it helps me out so first up I want to
talk about the processor the i-5 6400
here I recommend at least a true quad
core experience I can't recommend AMD at
this point they're platforms just too
old they're single core performances out
the window and until then gets here I'm
sticking with Intel sorry that's how
it's going to be single core performance
is just just it just it's dominated by
Intel at this point modern games do
demand for physical cores and that's
exactly what I've given you here with
the i-5 6400 relatively low clock speed
but you're still going to have 4
physical cores much better than an i3
even overclocked if you decide to do the
base clock overclocking method with the
i3 6100 so I 5 it is and then we're
going to need an ITX motherboard this is
an ITEX PC of course following suit with
an ode to o2 build we have an MSI h1 10
I Pro you can find this on new egative
of the the mail in rebate included but
about 70 bucks that's a pretty good
price for an ITX motherboard if you have
amazon
while they're out of stock currently but
Amazon once they do get those in stock
will have it up for around the same
price and RAM I've got with a single 8
gigabyte stick of Corsair Vengeance lpx
this is about a well around 40 bucks on
Amazon I'll go with one a gigabyte in
because if you do want to upgrade to 16
gigabytes later on you do have that
option versus if you want with 2 4
gigabyte DIMMs your going to have to
just ditch both of them if you want to
upgrade to 16 gigabytes so you do have
that option later on a few games do take
advantage of 16 gigabytes now but for
the most part eight will be fine you
won't be running a dual channel but
that's not going to change much either
I have already proven that and tested
that a data Premier SP 550 120 gigabytes
solid-state drive I recommend a
solid-state drive is going to change the
just the entire experience with your PC
everything's going to load so much
snappier you're going to have boot times
are going to be literally in the seconds
like you're not even going to exceed
probably 10 seconds with your boot times
as long as you install your operating
system on your solid-state drive you can
pick it up right now on Amazon for 43
bucks usually it's around 38 39 so that
might fluctuate a bit but that's still a
pretty solid price you know places with
a PNY and ocz try on from Toshiba any of
those brands I do recommend so you can
be flexible with this list of course I
just do like a data and the reliability
and the read and write speeds for the
price next up we're going to need more
general storage for games we have a one
terabyte Western Digital caviar blue
hard drive 50 bucks
the hard drive prices really don't
change so we're going to stick with that
that's a solid hard to strive there I
have used one in the past I'm not going
to recommend anything that I haven't
specifically used or had hands-on
experience with so except for well
except for this the GTX 1050 Ti I
haven't gotten my hands on the 1050 Ti
Nvidia did Sun one but I will say this
game will handle this graphics card will
handle 1080p no problem especially with
an i5 behind it in fact this made of
being our bottleneck in a few scenarios
maybe maybe more than that so this would
be something you should probably
consider upgrading later on if you
expect to move up to maybe 1440p gaming
the i-5 will handle 1440p but you'll
need a beefier graphics card this is
kind of a run-of-the-mill intro card so
1050 Ti I would equate to like a 960
from Maxwell's generation
60 will still play 1080p no problem at
around 60 FPS with high settings and you
have an i-5 to back that up so you're
going to be sitting very well then we
have a cooler Master Elite 110 this is a
cube case I'm not a fan of cube cases
but at least they tried to make this one
kind of look like it really I didn't
really blow up the image very much at
least they kind of try to make it look
like a subwoofer
kind of it just it'll blend in with your
furniture a bit more than some kind of
like white ostentatious curve box or
whatever and this one's really cheap so
if you want to get the $10 promo that
mail-in rebate there's going to bring
this price down to 30 bucks even for 40
dollars it's a great case and I have
played with this one a few times
actually add a few micro centers I've
been to lastly we're going to need a
power supply the ITX case does support
full ATX power supplies we have an EVGA
500 Y 80 plus bronze I've you're not
scuse me not 80 plus bronze it's just 80
plus something you're not going to
notice much of a difference but I have
used this one a few times in some budget
builds very quiet power supply if you're
worried about that it is very quiet even
under full load and will power
everything very well you actually have a
bit of breathing room
the 1050 Ti is not going to pull very
much from from the wall and the i5 is
also a very low-power chip so 500 watts
is actually more than you would need say
you can get away with 430 watt but if
you do plan on upgrading your graphics
card later on you will have that
breathing room I recommended 36 bucks
from Amazon boom you're good to go
so that's what I have so far folks for
600 bucks well yeah 600 bucks the
mail-in rebates do bring it tad bit
below $600 so if you don't consider
those 610 620 dollars that's still
within our area of breathing room for
$600 now one thing that I didn't include
that I'm sure if you've you're going to
be upset about is a CPU cooler a custom
CP cooler or third-party cooler I did
include one because I didn't have the
room for it in the budget there are
compromises you could make to include
one the Keurig c7 is my recommendation I
have tested this and it's a it's a great
cooler for the price so if you're
looking for some kind of ITX cooler the
c7 is one that I would choose but it is
thirty bucks so you're gonna have to
shave off some I don't know sure you
have to shave off the money somewhere
else I don't recommend cutting in your
graphics card any more than we already
have
you might could just ditch the one
terabyte
and replace this with a 240 you'll have
less storage but you only be paying
about 60 bucks versus around 90 so then
you'd have some room for a CPU cooler
there and you'd keep your price at
around the same $600 range so that's the
one thing that you could change I
wouldn't change anything else to be
honest you could change the form factor
that might you know affect your price a
bit but if you want to stay within the
ITX form factor this is the way that I
would go just based off of my experience
with building pcs I've built about 20 of
these pcs this year alone so you know
this is my first rodeo
but if I had 600 bucks and I was
supposed to build a 90 X PC this is this
is almost exactly what I would build if
not D build so if you have any questions
concerns leave those in the comments
below this has just been a quick little
you know what would I do with X amount
of money I feel like I'm experienced
enough in PC building now and I've had
my hands on enough parts to know what's
good and what's not so you may have
different experiences with these parts
but all in all I will say a lot of solid
1080p gaming PC and HTPC for about 600
bucks
very versatile and you actually can
actually you know carry the thing it's
not that large either
that's my PC build 600 bucks let me know
what you think about it in the comments
below and share it with your friends at
their student building something similar
to this this is Salazar studio thanks
for checking out the PC port picker list
with me links to the parts are in the
video's description thanks for learning
