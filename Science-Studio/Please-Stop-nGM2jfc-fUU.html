create a very brief video here totally
off-the-cuff unscripted just sit in
front of the camera and talk about the
difference between a leak and a tease I
feel like this is necessary I know a lot
of you already know the difference but
we're using the wrong word a lot of us
are and in the context of the Nvidia
r-tx Titan T's this in fact was not a
leak and I invite you guys I plead with
you to use the correct word because I
feel like it does what we actually saw
here a disservice
what Nvidia did was tell these yeah it
looks like it was orchestrated anybody
have probably told these reviewers to
tease the product on a specific day or
within a specific time range right prior
to the actual embargo date at which
point we should expect to see real
reviews regarding the viability of the
product or not you should buy it how it
stacks up to its competitors now aside
from the fact that I think I'm boxing
embargoes and anything equivalent to it
are completely stupid the fact is that
Nvidia did this on purpose I mean this
is not on purpose then wow I'm gonna
really eat crow but this is I mean you
can't tell me that that lioness on the
lan show and the J on jst cents did the
exact same thing the exact same way and
just completely randomly got it
perfectly in sync I mean it looks like
they're reading from the same script and
that's why I have a feeling either they
both went behind the scenes and did
something similar or Nvidia told all the
people who got these samples beforehand
that they have a certain day in which
they can release photos and or it'll you
know snapshots of the Box it's not even
really an unboxing embargo it's like a
box reveal embargo at around the same
time which was again this weekend so III
I just I wanted to make this video
because everyone online it seems like
pretty much everyone it's calling this a
leak and it's not because a week
according to many industry standard
definitions of the word I mean there's
many definitions of the word leak but in
the context of news right and
information a leak implies that this was
an unsolicited release of information as
in Nvidia did not intend for this
information to be released to the public
the fact that the Titan X growth not the
Titan X the RT X
Titan even exists but very clearly I
mean unless everyone decided to break
their embargo at the same time this was
orchestrated which means it was not a
leak and
that's why I just wanted to bring it to
your attention and whether or not a
dedicated video was necessary for this I
just I wanted to kind of bring it up
because it was just being overused and
in the wrong context so when we say it's
a leak it means somebody didn't intend
for this to happen but NVIDIA did so
when you look at it through this lens
and right NVIDIA told everyone to
release it or to reveal it kind of tease
it on a specific day well then we
understand invidious tactics now it
makes sense it makes sense from
marketing perspective right unboxing
embargoes are literally there to build
hype that is it that is all unboxing
embargoes do and I feel like NVIDIA
needs to build a lot of hype because the
RT X Titans probably in a cost in the
realm of $2,000 seeing that the 20 DTI
already costs $1,200 if not more
especially we're talking about abs now
if you want to ask me whether or not I
think the RT X cards are worth that I
have several videos talking about this I
think they're over priced right now I
think we're starting to get to the right
place and once Pascal inventories dry up
we might see these prices come down just
a little bit we're talking about a major
company though so it's not it's not
looking too good and NVIDIA has
literally no competition from AMD on the
other side of the aisle because best we
have is one Vegas 64 that competes
barely with a GTX 1080 which again is
about to go out of stock and then we'll
have just the RT X 2070 deal with at
around $4.99 to $5.99 that's kind of the
price range it's falling in hopefully it
eases toward the the lower end of the
list that number range but we'll see I
do want to kind of close this brief
again video out just with a few thoughts
about the Titans viability I do think
that it will be inadvertently marketed
toward gamers I mean those Titans are
never meant for gamers because you get
almost equivalent performance out of the
ti counterparts but we always have
gamers buy these cards because they do
want the absolute biggest and baddest
and that's why I think this card will
cost around $2,000 anything less than
that and I will be genuinely surprised
do I think this is gonna cause the other
cards to drop in price not really I
think we'll have more of an effect on
price with respect to Pascal inventories
drying up then we will from the launch
of the RT X Titan if we look at
historical prices and say we still have
another year to go before we see any
decent deals apart from like Brack Black
Friday and Christmas time and
have you Neels causing those prices to
fall so I just my take on that I've been
playing around battlefield 5 DXR and
stuff and I've noticed the differences
aren't too substantial the performance
cuts are pretty heavy but I expect other
games in the future we'll be able to
utilize this stuff a lot better without
adding the expense of a huge framerate
drop I don't think battlefield 5 was the
best representation list because
battlefield 5 is a first-person shooter
and you want those games to have high
refresh rates you want to have higher
frame rates in games because in that
game in particular because it just looks
so much more smooth when you're swinging
back and forth on screen it really does
help and any you know eSports player who
plays any first-person shooter will tell
you that the high refresh rate is
significantly better than a lower
refresh rate panel or a lower frame rate
in game so maybe not the best game for
RTX you know architecture to really flex
its muscles but I do have my I do have
hope right in the technology and the
future and developers being able to
utilize this technology in different
games that aren't as fast-paced at least
until we start to see the the toll on
the framerate start to decline that's
really what I'm looking forward to I
think we have a ways to go before that
happens but again just kind of a recap
just a quick news story I don't know
what you want to call this regarding
what you saw wasn't a leak totally
intentional was the r-tx
Titan that we will see released I'm sure
some time soon but it probably won't be
until 2019 that you could ever possibly
get your hands on one so if you're
looking for one around Christmas time
yeah unless they just swiftly launch
this thing it usually takes a few weeks
and/or months to get this stuff out once
we start seeing teases of it on social
media various news outlets and
what-have-you so stay tuned for that I
will link relevant news articles down
below if you're curious about what we
expect the Titan will feature it's not
gonna be much different from a 20 DT I
just spoiler but nonetheless it is there
it is something that we weren't sure
about because the 22 T is already priced
again at 1200 ollars but now I wanna
hear from you guys in the comments below
thumbs up thumbs down you guys know what
to do subscribe if you haven't already
and stay tuned for the After Hours live
streaming for watching this live on
Sunday night 9:00 p.m. CST we will be
live I'll have at least in the city as
well should be fun this is science
studio thanks for learning with us
