three words that Corsair themselves use
to describe their new 400-seat a fresh
new take on the conventional mid tower
PC case its minimalistic appeal
prominent acrylic side window and beefy
yet subdued stance all culminate into
what I believe to be a revitalization of
course there's custom PC entourage we've
got one in the studio and already
assembled a PC inside of it let's go
ahead and take a tour of this 100-dollar
work of art now first off I should
mention the elephant in the room yes it
looks very similar to the s340 from NZXT
now obviously NZXT fired the first shot
and the success of their version of the
case likely got the attention of
competing manufacturers but you've got
to give course there a bit of credit
where credit is due
first off course they're actually
realized that the s340 design was a
great one and in many ways you can tell
that they've tried to perfect an already
excellent design okay so this is a
review of the 400 C not the S 340 so
what makes this thing unique the front
is very minimalistic featuring nothing
more than a small and subtle Corsair
logo on the bottom right the entire
panel is removable as well giving way to
a spot for either two 120 or 140
millimeter fans or their radiator
counterparts a magnetic dust filter
rests between the panel and the fan
chassis if you're wondering where these
will push or pull air tour from not to
worry Corsair has included ventilation
grooves
along the side of the front panel itself
moving on to the top you'll find two
either 120 or 140 millimeter fan
brackets but as clearance is limited in
this case I would not recommend trying
to stuff a radiator up here included and
pre applied over the front mesh is a
flexible magnetic dust filter move to
the south of it and you'll find the
front IO consisting of the power button
two USB 3.0 ports microphone and
headphone jacks a hard drive LED and a
reset switch the right side of the case
is completely bare while the left side
boasts the 400 C's perhaps most
identifiable feature the large hinged
window made entirely out of acrylic a
very scratch Abul acrylic at that this
door provides enough stability to the
chassis and opens via a lever toward the
front I would have liked to have seen a
more robust handle but in case you're
wondering you can't open the front panel
at all unless you do pull on that little
hinge and I have to disagree with other
YouTube reviewers in this regard the
connection that the lever makes with the
chassis when it's finally closed is
fairly strong the entire acrylic panel
is removable as well if that matters to
you though you probably won't have to
remove it in any case because the door
does swing well over 270 degrees so
you'll have plenty of room to assemble
all of your gear inside of the case
without having to worry about that panel
ever getting in your way the back of the
case features support for a single 120
millimeter fan only no 140 millimeter
support in this case the rear i/o and
power supply cutouts of course and seven
PCI expansion slots assembling in this
case was a breeze the basement
compartment is actually a two-piece
design and is completely removable
giving way to your power supply and the
hard drive cage the cage supports two
three and a half inch hard disk drives
or two two and a half inch solid-state
drives
though you might find that the included
brackets are difficult to get to with
the basement panels reinstalled front IO
connectors and the graphics card power
cable can be routed through the slot on
top the 400 C also brings support for an
additional three solid-state drives
along the rear motherboard panel the
setup in this case is actually
completely to lists which is nice to see
three large rubber grommets do an
excellent job at concealing the 24 pin
power connector as well as additional
SATA USB and fan cables additional slots
are available for routing radiator
cables and their corresponding fans as
well the depth of the chassis is
satisfactory and allows for the
installation of even a hyper 212 Evo
with a bit of room to spare my only
complaint here is that the basement
panel is extremely difficult to remove
and reinsert I was actually pushing on
the bottom of my ATX motherboard at
times in order to wedge the plastic into
place I should also note at this point
that the original basement comes in
black this one was just custom painted
white after the fact the inside edges of
the kit are thick enough for LED light
kits to be run secure
and the several slots on the side and
top provide excellent cable and LED
management the right side of the case it
does have limited cable storage space
and the hard drive cage definitely makes
things worse
so opting for a longer power supply it
might be a bad idea in the 400 C even if
it's entirely modular however if you're
resorting to just SSDs you'll have the
entire bottom compartment to work with I
should also note there was just barely
enough clearance to close the right side
panel unhindered so if I had to just
come up with one more complaint about
this case it would be the acrylic side
window you're thinking wow that's the
best part it swings open it's huge you
can see everything inside one let me be
a little more specific here it does look
absolutely gorgeous and in my opinion
Trump's even the tempered glass
counterparts of other brands
however the acrylic itself is almost
always statically charged meaning that
dust and other debris are literally
pulled to it constantly hold your hand
over the panel and you'll feel what I
mean the static is real but other than
that and the tight squeeze of the
basement compartment I honestly have
nothing else to complain about I feel
like the price is slightly high
considering the s340 at this point in
time is about twenty-five dollars
cheaper than the 400 C but you're paying
for the appeal in this case and that is
having a sturdy ostentatious PC tower
with a window large enough to show off
even the sides of your radiators that is
what sets this PC apart from the rest in
my book now I want to know what you
think be sure to check out coursers link
to the 400 C in the description of this
video and leave your own personal
comments in the comment section below
that also remember that I don't get paid
for these reviews and nobody loans us
anything so all of the impressions that
I'm giving you are my own personal
impressions and are not influenced by
any particular corporation we just like
the 400 C on paper and wanted to test it
out in person other than that be sure to
