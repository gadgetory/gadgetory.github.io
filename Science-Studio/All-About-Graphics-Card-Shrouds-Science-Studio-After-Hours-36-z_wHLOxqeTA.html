it out I am being told that uh it's not
viewable I can't preview my own live
stream before I click live so for all I
know I might be talking into the abyss
and if that is the case I guess I don't
really need to apologize nobody's
listening we'll see I'm watching it now
it's gonna be delayed just to just the
tad give me a second here and okay oh it
looks great and I couldn't I couldn't
view it before I clicked live for some
reason it was saying an error occurred
please try again play back ID you know
gonna figure it out we're gonna figure
it out
Kevin II says you're late I'm late by
three minutes if that if that's a sin
then sure I apologize but in the
corporate world that's on time so it's
all I'm gonna that's my that's my case
I'm just gonna say because other people
do it it's okay let's see I see I love
you from India how is it going way over
what time is it an India I see what time
it is right now is India in one timezone
or two let's see India timezone India
Standard Time it is currently 8:33 a.m.
over there
Wow that is that's oh you're actually 12
and a half hours is it is that right
twelve and a half hours or eleven and a
half hours ahead of me
Central Time that's really cool you're
literally on the other side of the world
and your time zones are like split in
half like you guys have like 30 minute
increments it's a lot different than how
we do it here is just cuts and cut in
two hours so that's weird Canon says
much love from Down Under Greg I
appreciate that I have always wanted to
go to Australia and I hope someday soon
I'll get to nico says greetings from
germany 4:00 a.m. what are you doing up
this early or I mean I guess is it late
did you wake up this earlier you've just
been pulling an all-nighter whoa stay
stable says three minutes late is early
for the wind show excuse me I'm not
gonna say anything about the wind show
it's a good show but they they do often
show just
literally willsez Niihau it's like the
only Chinese phrases that will and I
don't say cows is looking good Gregg I
appreciate that Kyle I I would say that
you're looking good too but I can't see
what you look like is your profile
picture is a letter K it's like the
default okay so let's see teak sit I
smell like cheese I'll have to ask Lisa
if I smell like cheese I really hope I
don't I don't like the smell of cheese
Jesus I mean by nature of how it's made
it's technically rotten I mean you can
have good smelling cheese but you're
still smelling a rotted dairy product in
most cases kind of gross anyway let's
see Salinger curses I should try to do a
build off against IKEA City and Brian
and I have talked about this numerous
times the issue is the time zones that's
really difficult to coordinate we have
to be together in the same place at the
same time for it to really be fair
because our markets are really not
comparable you know even if you transfer
transfer even if you basically you know
convert all the currencies it still
costs more typically for parts in
Australia but I guess if we'd been like
a fully used build which I guess is what
we would be doing if we competed with
each other then we would know we'd
really have to we'd have to figure out
how to do it how to line it all up where
we could do it in separate places
because I mean he has his market and I
have my market and I don't know if
people would see at this fair or not
people are really touchy I mean I'm sure
you guys know that but they are very
sensitive on hmm excuse me on on YouTube
so I I don't really know how we're gonna
approach that I'm gonna refresh the page
because it said that 12 people were
watching and I just wanted to see if
that was actually true or not okay here
we go double-dog oh what's the best AI
Oh plenty of good AI was out there a lot
of them use the same pump so they're
gonna perform about the same it really
just comes down to which one you think
looks the best ultimately as long as
they're all running the latest ASA tech
bum even some of the older ASA tech
pumps are fine they're gonna run quiet
you might have a dead pump after a year
or two or two weeks
you never know luck of the draw so the
failure rates slightly higher than than
that of air coolers I would imagine but
it's it's really just gonna come down to
which one you think looks the best and
which one is the best
you because they're all gonna perform
about the same I've never gotten like an
AI oh that performs terribly they all
just kind of do the same thing
especially if you're talking about
similar rad space - I got a policy for a
second because bazinga just donated $100
and I'm gonna try my best to give him
$100 worth of input here cuz I really
don't think this is this is why I don't
do consulting full-time because I would
feel like I was ripping everybody off
like they would pay me for my time and
I'd be like that was really easy I feel
like you shouldn't have had to have paid
me that much bazinga I did this out of
zone free will and my dude you are a
champ isn't as always here bazinga is
always supporting if you can tell every
time well you can't see in this super
chat but whenever he comments he is a
4-star member on science studio which
means he has been supporting us as a
member on the channel for at least four
months now I'm pretty sure he's been
around for like half a year and
hopefully he's sixth around visiting he
was a good guy and not just because he
throws money at me but also because he
genuinely brings good stuff to the table
like this question here building system
for multitasking videos Excel Outlook
stock ticker okay cool data crunching
gaming plus more on a multi-screen
system all at the same time okay I see
where this is going
AMD 2990 WX until 99 80 XC or 79 80 XC
budget 2k for the CPU money towards
Lisa's Valentine's Day alright
I'm sure she's watching right now so I
guess I have no choice
oh I'll take her out to dinner and
figure out how else to stretch that
hundred bucks that's actually more than
I was planning to spend on Valentine's
Day is that bad so I will tell her
dinner is on bazinga
to answer your question excuse me AMD
2990 WX I feel like you're gonna
multitasking like videos Excel Outlook
that stuff is if you're gonna do all
that at the same time it really isn't
gonna matter which CP you choose they
can all do it fine in fact you could
drop down to the Z platform or they're
the Rison platform and still be fine
right you could drop down to X 470 you
could even get by with a B Series board
and do what most of these things but if
you're talking about data like Sirius
data
then plus more on a multi-screen system
the stock ticker is not gonna be that
big an issue video editing it's really
gonna come down how how much you want to
spend I know you have that budget there
but if I was shopping on my own for
something that I just wanted to be at an
absolute warhorse then gosh that's a
tough one it really depends on the price
it really does I think I that's that's
really difficult I'd have to really like
crunch the numbers myself and and and
figure out which which would be the best
in terms of the the programs you wanted
to use cuz there are somewhere Intel's
going to benefit you a bit more on at
the same time you telling me that money
doesn't matter then just get the best of
the best I would just go with the 99 80
xD screw it I know I know that's really
tough to recommend like I don't like
recommending the x-series chips that
really at all because 95 to 99% of
people are gonna use most of those cores
anyway so I don't know that's a that's a
that's a tough one
but I would say just go all-in just go
ham get the 99 8 exe and call it a day I
mean what can you do alrighty if you're
if you want to flex the muscles and you
want to have as much Headroom as
possible then you're gonna get that
you're gonna get the overclocking
Headroom to the extent that I mean your
systems gonna pull a principle you're
gonna do a really beefy power supply put
it that way make sure you get a good
board board with solid power delivery
standards and I mean you're gonna need
to a pin ups is for sure and and you
know move on from there but yeah I'd
just go all in 90 and 90 XE screw it and
then go for 64 gigs of ram at least I
mean I guess if you're gonna throw all
in just get the best of the best fill up
all eight DIMM slots and show it off to
everyone who walks in let's see Fae
lease hours I say name faily flowers
Greg does more vram help push more
higher FPS and higher resolution and
games so having more VM is not going to
give you a higher frame rate in
itself but what it can do is reduce your
frame rate if the GPU is not able to
store as much in memory like if it's
filling up memory entirely and it's not
able to load everything it needs to then
it's going to have to run all those
things real time and that's going to cut
into your frame rate it's going to
increase the load on the GPU as a result
you do have things like page filing you
can store things in system RAM but it's
all it's all got to move through to the
GPU and it's much faster if it's already
stored and insisted in the system Ram in
your video memory so it's more or less a
bottleneck issue that's how I would look
at it so most cards aren't going to
inherently bottleneck themselves there
are exceptions to that rule when there
are three and six good variants of cards
or four and a gig variants of cards
typically the lower vram offering is
going to be a bottleneck sometimes and
that's why they offer two options right
so in the case of the 1060 the 1060 is a
three gig card and a six gig card
depending on which one you choose you
could run into a bottleneck with your
something with your video memory so if
you stack on tons of texture packs and
you you know extend distance scaling to
max and maybe you frame scale and do all
this other crazy stuff with the 1060
which I don't recommend to do with that
caliber car but anyway if you did three
gigs of ram might be a bottleneck in
fact in a lot of modern games it will be
a bottleneck so make sure that you are
aware of the limitations with the game
you're playing with respect to the VM
that you have your disposable and just
be a little you know be be flexible with
your in-game settings you're going to
have to adjust things especially if
you're on a card with a lower amount of
VRAM I would say anything under four is
going to be difficult to to get by with
in some modern titles that said those
cards probably are going to struggle in
general running those modern titles if
they only have two gigs or so of RAM so
that's why I don't typically recommend
the 68 or excuse me the three gig 1060
because you could run into that
bottleneck potentially but if you're on
a tight budget and you're not looking
for the best of the best in terms of
in-game graphics then you could
certainly drop some settings in-game and
get by with three gigs so it's a
bottleneck it's not something that's
going to give you more frames in game if
you already have enough
and you have extra you know memory
leftover that's not being used in the
card so yep here we go scrolling down
here by the way bazinga says I need to
do 20 push-ups for being three minutes
late see me on Twitter bazinga I'll do
it
let's see Spyder says his Corsair pump
failed after six years I say that's
pretty impressive I'm not sure what the
average lifespan is or the cycle life
cycle is of that pump of I'm assuming
it's nice to take pump that's pretty
good I would say that's to be expected I
would expected it to fail earlier than
that if you use your system quite often
then that's yeah and that's that's no
small feat for sure let's see here
gate Amon asks who makes an am3+ board
with MDOT - I don't know I haven't
actually paid attention to that it's
been a while since I've addressed MDOT -
it's been a while since I've addressed
a.m. 3 in general I'm actually going to
revisit it very soon I don't think the
board I have on hand supports MDOT to I
mean you this is something you could
search for yourself I could search for
it but I think it's a waste of time you
could do it just as quickly as I can if
if there are even boards that do support
it I'm not sure I haven't done that
research
let's see scrolling down scrolling down
answer a few more questions I don't want
to get into the graphics card shrouds I
do have to honor the title just a little
bit you guys have related questions here
let's see a good question from evolve
203 hey Greg would you recommend an r5
1600 or 2600 pair with an RX 580 a gig
for a gaming streaming PCM building
either one's gonna be fine obviously the
2600 gonna overclock just a bit better
you're gonna have more stable power
delivery when you overclock up to about
4 or to 4.2 gigahertz it's a very linear
scale up to a point and it's gonna
really take off I would also say that if
you're worried about memory speed memory
frequency then going with Zen Plus will
be a better option so the 2600 you will
get marginally better frame rates and
games because of that as well since the
Infinity fabric is tied to memory speed
dependencies so 26 under is a better bet
it just really comes down to how much
you want to spend for it you're gonna
spend a little more to hit 2600 and feel
good
about it then get the 2600 I'm not in
your shoes but that's what I would do I
would just go with the the 2600 unless
there was like maybe a $50 disparity
between the two in which case I think
the $50 you could probably push him to a
better graphics card and make it for the
difference in the the RAM frequency
anyway so you have to play around in
your market let's see scrolling down
Peppa brother Dave asks what games I
play I'm not sure if he's asking me or
somebody else I play a lot of City
skylines I love kind of like open world
like simulator games so that kind of
thing like any kind of sim game like I
like the The Sims I played The Sims a
lot growing up I like SimCity games like
SimCity 4 was it was a really good one
for me I even played the old-school
Maxis ones like sim golf I play pub G
quite a bit I play a little bit of GTA 5
still Call of Duty and then a little bit
of battlefield 5 I just got in a grip
which is like a rehash of roll cage
Stage two or death track that was a game
that I played when I was a kid on my
dad's old Compaq
back in the day it's really not that far
back in the day but very very different
from today in terms of the technology we
have at our disposal yeah let's do one
more question here real quick we'll get
back to the questions again don't don't
freak out I just do I do want to address
the graphics card shrouds because we
actually had quite a number of people
submit pictures of either their cards or
cards that they that they found online
that they really like the design of and
this isn't really anything scientific
we're not gonna get into like the the
different you know thermal solutions and
how effective each is we're just gonna
look at some sexy graphics card shrouds
and it's gonna be our it's gonna be our
little chill time here and then we'll
jump back into the questions you guys
are awesome asking a ton of stuff let's
see here but bazinga wants me to our
World of Tanks I could certainly do that
let's see okay
okay
I'm looking for something juicy that's C
Scanlon yeah yeah Andrew asks hey Greg
I'm doing a 1080p build I've got a 1066
gig on an Intel 8th gen plat for it and
platform am I good
what kind of Intel CPU I mean I think
even if you paired an i3 with that you'd
be fine in 1080p honestly because the i3
is now a proper quad cores most games
are gonna be still fine with 4 cores so
yeah I think that's a I think that's a
good target what you got going on there
then you chose a6 King Varian which I
think was wise as well
Zeppelin asked what DL SS is literally
uploaded that video yesterday so you can
watch that video on your own time and
then Abel what do you think of the rx
588 gig I've reviewed it so you can
watch my review on an Rx 580 I've even
talked about our x5 80s especially in
the used market there great value really
great value all right so into the topic
at hand I'm going to pull up twitter
here because I want to show you guys
some of the yeah let's see here
I'll show you guys some of the entries
but just the submissions you guys made
regarding your favorite GPS routes our
graphics course routes so my favorite
and I make no secret of this is this
right here I think this is one of the
the best-looking graphics card shrouds
on the market and I say that for a few
reasons first off I want to make very
clear EVGA is not paying me or we didn't
even talk about this I'm just doing that
I don't even work very I haven't worked
with EVGA in quite a while
they send power supplies I like their
power supplies a lot they use C sonic
for quite a number of them I like C
sonic power supplies and then I've got a
few cards from them but nothing recent I
just wanted to show you guys which
shroud I think is the best looking and I
mean it's gonna be subjective totally
subjective but I really like this one
because it's so it's just simple there's
nothing super crazy about it
I like the honeycomb
design over the LEDs again very subtle
LEDs black shroud black fans runs very
quiet it's just a I mean it's a
reference board there's nothing special
about this card at all in terms of like
away it's not overhauled it's not
constructed from the ground up
redesigned it is just I don't know I
think it's very clean looking so yeah
and let's see here you guys on Twitter
have been sending me your opinions for
the favorite for your favorite ones I'm
gonna show you guys some of these live
so let me get the screen capture ready
to go let's see if I can all right we're
gonna have to click this and then scroll
down okay there we go that's pretty good
alright okay so we're gonna swing this
around up how does that look okay I
gotta move it just a little bit further
further over that doesn't really do it
any good does it
let's see I can do it like that ever
guess not too bad yeah that'll work
I think yeah okay let's see if I can
zoom zoom this in just a tad sorry I'm
Chuck
let's try it again let's see if this
works I'm not even sure if I'm like I
guess I'm alive
i just opened the open stream let's back
up and click go alive again i'm assuming
it's the same feed so we'll see i'm
watching myself live and i have no idea
if it's actually working or not but
we'll just roll with it
oh yeah this is working now okay so i'm
gonna pivot back to this screen great
alright I'm just gonna leave it as is
I'm not gonna try to change anything
about this so I'm gonna scroll down and
see some entries here yeah alright I
think that's really all we need to see
with this I'm just joking okay so this
is a transparent shroud and you know
I've been I've been wondering why this
isn't more common I know EVGA did
something similar to this I want to say
with their 2080 maybe the twenty atti of
course it's a blower style card not a
fan of blower style cards but it's I
mean it's decent it's it's different I
guess I should say and it's definitely
vintage so there's that scrolling down
to let's see this other entry here it's
an XF extra this is an older car from a
7000 series so you would see this
probably in something like a 70 to 79
no no 7970 this I'm not sure which which
card this would be but I get it it's
simplistic you got the silver on the top
silver on the bottom got the rings
around the two fans I think two fan
cards look really great I do have I
don't know I I do have like a secret
crush on three fan cards
that's what Jakob points out here these
definitely look good right this is the
EVGA 1080 TI this is the AC Strix
equivalent and I agree these look really
good but but these often cost a lot more
than their to fan counterparts I mean
they're just beefier cooling solutions
and often times are over
kill especially on the r-tx cards
they're just overkill
so there's there's that here's another
3:3 fan card this is the fury nitro I
actually have this card I got well my
brother uses it right now but this is
the r9 fury and the Sapphire nitro
version has three fans it actually
extends this so I don't know if you can
see this here but the PCB ends about
right here and then the shroud extends
further over and there's just kind of
like a if you saw the other side of it
it'd just be kind of like a plastic
interweaving there on the backside so
the cooler is actually a lot bigger than
the PCB is and that's just because these
cards generally run a pretty hot so I am
let's see if we have any smaller cards
yeah I see someone here Aaron says he
likes the GeForce or the AC X 3.0 cards
from EVGA ooh
I think laggy boys being just a bit of a
troll here Radeon HD 6970 with that
classic blower style you guys remember
the cards I had like your favorite
videogame characters on them like
there's a totally different time back
then this one is uh it's definitely
definitely old-school but I don't know
okay we got some water blocks here this
is a different this isn't really what I
had in mind but I could definitely see
how you guys would like this kind of
stuff too
custom cold stuff always looks good I
mean you could take like I haven't even
seen to date an ugly graphics card
waterblock like I just I have never seen
one they all look good especially when
you turn the card sideways and you can
see straight into it from the side of
your case to me that just looks too good
well let's see scrolling down here we
got Mike Mike Sanchez is showing off his
EVGA I'm not sure if at the ten seventy
or a ten eighty they used the exact same
round but he used that vertical amount
and it is looking mighty fine I mean
when you like a shroud this much you got
to show it off right and so that's what
he's doing there looking really good we
have another entry for the double
dissipation ghost cards this is a 70
yeah this is a 79 70
so this is the okay a close second would
be the Nitro plus our
580 so SFX they're XFX cards and also
the Sapphire Series card seems like
there's a trend here
interesting scrolling down what else do
we have all right we got Donnie we've
got an entry for honey nut cheerios you
guys can see the honey nut cheerios
right there this is not a plug for honey
nut cheerios but you get the points and
then we have an RX 590 looking good is
it arc 590 yeah I don't have a picture
but the Radeon r9 380 X nitro is the
most simple yet elegant design GPU I've
ever seen I even considered buying one
for decoration but I do have one of
these Cheerios for scale it's literally
the size of a cereal box is pretty good
I like it
scrolling down let's see what else we
have here yes super super Clarke 1060
models I like this because all these
EVGA ACX cards look pretty similar even
the 10 to 50 s 1050 TI's had similar
shrouds so you weren't really losing the
aesthetic factor when you paid less for
a cheaper card I like that we have here
oh is looking good I'm not sure which
card this is I haven't seen it yet I'm
sure it's it's probably Vega 56 or 64 or
maybe that the Radeon 7 it's one of
those I'm sure it looks pretty
futuristic yes sapphire does a great job
with cards I've got to give him credit I
mean this is this is looking pretty
pretty good and I guess a three fan card
right so it looks like you have two
larger fans these might be oh if I had
to eyeball at maybe 100 millimeter fans
and then this one here is probably 80
mil I'm not sure but just off the top
well it might be a little bigger than
that but this is looking really good
I wonder if this like whole thing lights
up or not I've never seen this car
before I can't believe it it looks
really good then you get the sapphire
logo up top looks like two 8-pin so it's
definitely definitely power-hungry
and let's see what else we got here
Jeremy is showing off his r-tx 2070 this
is the EVGA card can't really see the
shroud but I do I do like it when you
got this the this isn't really as subtle
as I'd like but when you have the
glowing logo of not only the company but
also the card you're sporting so people
who appear inside are going to know
exactly what you are sporting
let's see here what else do we have
anything else okay cool we got the wind
force cards I agree these look pretty
good so like the nine 70s like the G
ones from gigabyte these worked really
good I had a couple of these cards I'm
pretty sure this is the nine it's added
to the 970 or the 980 I might be then I
say that now I might be what does it
have to deviate oh I wouldn't think
that's a nine I don't think that's a
nine eighty or ninety DTI I might be
wrong but with an eight pin and a 6 pin
kind of hard to tell could be like a
seven seven eighty or something I don't
know sure if they use that shroud for
the older stuff but that is a
good-looking card I agree I remember
that wind force logo load up like a deep
blue it was good looking it's not that's
a good entry there I agree with you on
that one
all right Andrew Crane saying that his
is the MSI twin frozer - and you know
I've got it I've got to be honest with
you here this actually looks pretty sick
because the shroud doesn't really cover
the entire PCB it's not even covering
the entire cooler actually it you can
see part of the fin stack right there
and then you can see these massive
nickel plated copper heat pipes work in
there windows pretty cool that's not bad
at all this would be one of those cars I
definitely want to turn sideways because
those those heat pipes coming out of
there just look super sexy I actually
agree with you this is definitely an
older car you can see sporting two DVI
ports but it's still good-looking look
at that you got the MSI carpet into the
back plate that's pretty chill I like
that one that's a that's a good one
Andrew okay here it is I knew we'd see
one of these Charles is partial to the
new Radeon GPUs so this one here is the
raid on 7 it looks like and what are you
guys think about this like lit up cube
in the corner they did this with with
Vega and and I I mean it's it's a it's
different you know is different but is
it really worth I don't know to me
you're stuck with red right so if you
have a blue color scheme you going on
then all of a sudden you got this red
are like even if you turn it off you can
still see that it's red because it's
actually like a red plastic cube in
there I don't know I just I think the
shrouded stuff looks really good but but
this up here in the corner it's just not
my cup of tea let's just it's just not
and I heard these run pretty loud so
we'll see I don't have I don't have one
in the studio so I can't really comment
on build quad or anything but from the
looks of it it doesn't look too bad
let's see power house here is talking
about what's he got over there that's an
asus strix it looks like either i can't
tell if it's an RT x card i doesn't i
don't think it is because it would say
RT x right there I believe so it's
probably a 1070 or a 1080
oh yeah 1080i yep and that's a
good-looking card I'm actually rocking
the RT X 2080 right now so we are very
comparable in terms of graphics graphics
card horsepower my friend that's a good
choice the only thing I hated about
these cards and they still kind of have
this issue but not as bad I messed I
mentioned this in the the review of the
RT X 2080 from Asus that I got is that
the LEDs on the on both the the front
here you can see where it says Republic
of gamers and also on top the ROG logo
these do not sync up perfectly like if
you if you set these colors to let's say
you set the whole thing to white then
this is gonna look white ish and this is
gonna look blue or vice versa you get
what I'm saying so like they're not both
going to look identical if you set these
both to purple one's going to look a
deeper purple and one's going to look
you know a lighter shade more like pink
and and they just wouldn't sync up
because the LED the the zoning for the
for the LEDs themselves was just off a
little bit and I understand like you're
trying to cram all that into a space
between the back plate and PCB but still
it just kind of bothered me is the only
thing I didn't like about the asus strix
cards but if you're not a fan i've
already to be anyway you can just turn
all that crap off and you have to worry
about it so yeah let's see but yeah
those are the entry so far if you guys
have more then feel free to let me know
and I'll zoom through them on Twitter
and we can we can assess them so if you
have an entry you guys can follow me on
Twitter you huh you don't even have to
follow me you just tweet at me and I'll
see it so click the Twitter handle link
down below in the video description
upload a picture of either your rig
whatever you're currently sporting or a
picture that you rip from online of your
favorite graphics card shroud and we'll
go back through in a few minutes and
reassess some of the new injuries but
anyway I like the trend that's what I
really wanted to get to I like the trend
grab
card designs are taking it's not it's I
mean there's really no benefit to the
way the card looks other than the fact
that you feel better about the bill when
you're looking at it right we put our
PCs on our desk because we want to look
at them we want to admire the sheer
beauty and the computational power
packed into such a small space
especially when you build them
yourselves like you feel a sense of
pride
that's good that's normal and on top of
that having hardware that actually looks
really good you know at the same time is
just the icing on the cake and and I
make no secret of the fact that I do
probably way the this stylistic the
design factor of a build more than I
should because ultimately end of the day
you're not gonna get any extra frame
rate you're not gonna get any you know
reduction in render times or anything by
making your build look a little more
sexy by using custom cables or whatever
but I treat my builds like art I try to
treat all of them like are even the
cheapest ones like the three hundred
dollar bills I try to make them look as
good as possible not in the budget
constraints that we have just because I
try to take pride in what I do you know
whether it's an expensive build or a
cheap build you can still cable managed
you can still you know try to fix some
of the issues with the you know maybe I
don't know I mean just you could use
your imagination just things you could
try to fix up make them look a little
better so why I always pick on the cable
management when I look at Craigslist
builds you know cuz like if you're
trying to sell your build and you just I
can tell that you didn't take any time
to make things look decent I'm just I
got a call it out I mean I just what I'm
thinking in my head so I'm gonna say it
I'm gonna I'm gonna be honest with what
the thought process that I that I have
when I see ads like that you know if you
if you value your time and you value
your your input into your bill that
you're willing to sell to somebody else
in my opinion you should take a few
extra moments cable manage try to clean
things up on the inside especially when
you're taking pictures of it post it
online that's just that's just my take
some people call that picky I just call
that having a certain standard and I
would never buy a bill unless I was
doing it for for the obvious reason of
buying it because it was ugly I would
never buy a build that just looked
trashy that had cables everywhere but it
was filled with dust I
do it I couldn't even if it was $100
bill I couldn't do it it just yeah I
don't know STS says don't care what
anyone says
aesthetics matter to the buyer -
absolutely yes and look you can have
your own standard I'm not telling you
how to buy a building out telling you
what your standard should be I'm just
being honest with my own standards
because I mean I've been doing this for
a while I think that there there's a
certain way it should look and if it
doesn't look anywhere close to the way
that like the optimal way you know like
you righted your cables you tuck them in
where you should oven and you kept
things out of out of the way so that
you're not impeding airflow or anything
like that if you did all those things
that's good but if you didn't you know
the verge build whoo oh oh gosh let's
see here you guys are rocking and
rolling up a bus growing up I'm gonna
see if we have anything looking my man
Zack says he just posted his card on
Twitter all right we got some entries
here oh yeah you guys are awesome I see
the submissions looking good okay all
right we're gonna have to go through
these again
oh yeah and we're gonna have to go
through these yeah mm-hmm okay okay I
think I'm just gonna scroll up in my
notification feed so we can look at
these okay so here we go pivoting back
to very quickly the graphics card shroud
since we're on this topic on the topic
of aesthetics here we go let me slide
this over is that gonna work I think
that oh that's good enough
whatever you get the point you get the
point all right so Oh looking good here
all right nice and juicy okay so we got
you chances I came from a time when
cards were single slot and yeah okay I
don't even know what card that is what
is it
no no no contacts like GV in 95 TOC I'm
sure maybe that's like a way to figure
it out but yeah blue PCB with a gold
shroud that's like the size of my palm
what do you guys think the old-school
stuff I'm sure some of our older folk
have a preference toward the simpler
designs I get it I mean technically
you're gonna be paying more for this
anyway I do like the fact that on these
cards you can swap out the shrouds it's
really cool that EVGA does this I like I
really like just companies that give you
a bit of flexibility in that sense like
if you want to tweak it make it look a
little more like yours you know let's
say you're you prefer red then just swap
the shroud out right really cool fractal
does that with their their defining mesh
if I cases I have well the mesh my case
is for sure you can swap out the mesh
front filters to me that looks just
really cool it's a cool thing that they
give you the option do that man you know
they're not very expensive either to
swap these out so yeah again it's just
an aesthetic play like this is not gonna
give you any extra framerate right I
mean you'd have to be I don't know an
idiot to think that this we gave you
extra frames in-game but it's gonna look
really good it's gonna make you feel a
little better about your build
especially if you're going for a certain
color scheme so yeah and then just to
touch on the EVGA 10a to TI for the win
three cards in general I think this is a
really nice design really do is it was
one of my favorite designs honestly
let's see here we got the Exelero
extreme 4 on a stock GTX 1080 so you can
see this shroud of this cooler extends
quite a bit past the PCB this is a
triple slot I mean this is one of those
aftermarket ones you can kind of pack on
there but yeah I mean these aren't the
most beautiful in my opinion I think
they're a little more rugged a little
more industrial it's still it does the
job right it's gonna be better than the
than the stock cooler on these 1080 so
hey you gotta get a quieter system make
it a different look
I think that's yeah that's money right
there silver says that he likes this
shroud right here really hoping they
bring it back to the 20 DTI I would
totally rock that so this is like a
hybrid it is I'm pretty sure I'm pretty
sure
like a hybrid cooler and it's a yeah the
Poseidon series yeah so so it's it's
active cooling in the sense that you
have fans working right to cool VRML I
get stuff you also have the the pass
through with the water block integrated
pretty sure I'm pretty sure I I've never
built with this block before but I'm
pretty sure that's how it works at least
it's it's gonna be somewhat water-cooled
unless this is just one big troll and
I'm gonna sound really stupid live if
that's the case but an interesting
design and yeah I agree I think a C's
fans look really cool there's nothing
really like special about the way they
look but I think that's why I like them
so much because there's just there's so
many fan blades and they're just kind of
flat monotone it's a different look and
I think that a lot of people appreciate
that pictures of my old XFX
rx 480 Black Edition I love the
backplate yeah this black back plates
were pretty cool I like how it cuts out
right around that GPU brace I really
like this cutout here it's not for
everybody you know again it's if some
people I'm sure going to hate this I'm
not really sure why there are a ton of
holes punched over here I don't know
maybe that was just for like just
letting keep pass through I have no idea
you can see the blower over here like
these cards they weren't the greatest in
terms of cooling capacity and being able
to stay quiet but I think they did a
pretty good job with the reference model
I think I think it frankly though NVIDIA
has been doing better recently with
their founders Edition cards even though
it's a pain in the butt apparently to
take apart the r-tx 2060 it is a
beautiful card and it's a very heavy
card you just tell it was just made
quality attention to detail I went into
it to an extent anyway Peter wants me to
rate is build well Peter it's a little
difficult to rate a bill that I can't
really see Indian so I mean I can see
the inside of it let's see here is that
what is this what is it that your that
your USB 3.0 cable
you should probably swing this thing
through this little rubber grommet here
that way it's just poking over just like
that right that's that's the first thing
that I noticed let's see you have your a
i/o tubes you have one going way up
there
I don't know where it comes back down
but well that's all right you have a
green color scheme very clearly this is
kind of it's kind of bothering me over
here that white led you got everything
else is green I know you can't change
that that's still I mean to clean build
though apart from this cable this is the
only thing that really caught my
attention I think it's not bad
and you have looks like a Corsair 5 70 X
not my favorite case the build in it's a
difficult case to build in but it is a
beautiful case so I'll give you that
oh yeah it's not bad if I had to rate it
on a scale of one to ten just from an
aesthetic standpoint I'd say it's like a
7.5 I don't think it's I don't think
it's ugly enough to be like a 6 but I
don't think it's like super beautiful to
wear it I want to rate you an 8 or 9 I'm
gonna be kind of savage when it comes to
this stuff but I mean yeah let's see
next one is the Radeon so these are the
the mega cards we were talking about and
this one's a gold one I mean do you
really like it it's gold
it's just an interesting color scheme
like I don't know I this was that I
forget what this is this is like that
initial like launch model I forget what
they called it somebody knows what they
call this but anyway I think it's OK
again this goes back this is like
similar to how AMD does most of their
founders cards with that blower style
cooler the back plates look pretty cool
as we just saw but you know the Titan
cards the Titan founders edition cards I
think I like this better than I like the
radar card here I mean this is - this is
too plain for me like you got this
random yellow logo and then you got the
blower and that's really it right but
then you get up here you get to this one
I know you can't really see it very well
it's a small image but to me this just
this just looks more appealing you can
see inside you can see the fin stacks in
there they've done a little more here to
make the the blower seem like it's a
part of the shroud and then it's all
black on top of that and I'm a big fan
of all black components so that that
looks really good now you got to pay a
price tag for this and it's no no small
price tag but still if we're just
judging aesthetically speaking I think
this is
this is pretty good it's one of my
favorite ones alright scrolling up here
we have the old 780ti from msi this is
looking good this is another one of
those where like it's a very particular
color scheme so if you like yellow a lot
then this is gonna be something that you
really enjoy there's I mean as far as I
know there was nothing really
spectacular about this card but it was a
beefy card and it kept things rather
cool 780ti wasn't the most efficient but
it you know when paired with a cooler
like this wasn't it wasn't bad at all
stayed pretty quite as far as I know
it's been a while since I've touched 782
I the last 72 t I tested actually I only
tested one 780ti I want to say I often
go back and find that video if I even
made a video on it I know I bought one
from eBay but I don't know if I actually
made a video I bought a 760 and I made a
video on that one too oh well I threw it
into a bill then anyway anyway yeah so
this is cool again I like you how they
have the two larger fans I think is
probably close to 100 mil fans or maybe
ninety eighty mill and then a smaller
one here in the Sun this one actually
looks more like 80 mil but yeah so
another one that I actually I agree with
that and we have another entry for the I
see XFX ffft w3 from EVGA this is a good
looking card can't deny it and is this a
white shroud I can't tell if it's white
or silver but either way it's ages looks
really good this is one of those cards
I'd want to turn sideways you know you
know Titan X this is the the Jedi the
last order I want to say the the
specials and this one I'm going to
happen to the picture anyway it just
looked a little everybody it was cool it
supposed to be like a lifesaver
basically moving on we have the the
Kraken so we have the NZXT was this the
g12 bracket and we have a crack and it
looks like cooler stamp to it compatible
with a so tech pumps and NZXT is kind of
lit up over there yeah this is a nice
shroud I don't know if I made a video
dedicated to the bracket I want to say I
did I know I have a couple in the
inventory but I don't know if I have a
used one yet I just haven't had to use
one but yeah this is a cool idea and
then I'm frankly I mean they're pretty
popular too as far as I know people that
want to you know water cool their
graphics cards but don't want to throw
custom loops into
Ricks can do something like this and
keep their graphics cards a nice and
chilly at least until those water temps
warm up so yep we have a quite a number
of entries still we'll get through those
I don't want to take up all your time
just looking at graphics cards routes
but it's fun to just kind of reminisce
to an extent and also just imagine how
much better graphics cards they're going
to look ten years from now five years
from now like what are we gonna have
next like what's the next big thing
right RGB was so cool four or five years
ago now people are just either upset by
it
or expect it and probably both and so
you have to expect this will move into
something else right if it's not RGB
what's it gonna be next what's the next
big thing so I imagine RGB will stay in
the mainstream for quite a while
but there'll be something else I think
added to it some other way to manipulate
the colors that will help graphics cards
sell because there are so many options
out there yeah it's ZOTAC gigabyte EBG a
msi I mean heck even like companies like
asrock or making graphics cards now and
like wow you know like all this
competition
granted a lot of them are designing
their own custom PCBs but still they're
all gonna perform fairly similarly
especially like with these r-tx cards
they're all held back by their power
limits right so they're all gonna run at
60 70 degrees Celsius it's really just
gonna come down to how expensive they
are and how good they look and that's
where these companies are trying to set
themselves apart do they look really
good can you customize this can you
change this it's just another
competitive advantage they're trying to
take advantage of I don't blame them I
do the same thing if I was in that
market so I mean this exciting stuff for
us competition is a good thing and we're
you know I expected we'll keep will
continue to see things like this
over time all these new launches all
these new cards new shrouds new designs
I'd love to be a member of the design
team for graphics card shroud so that
would be so fun III would have to also
keep in mind that the shroud itself
should not really limit the cards
ability to cool itself that's a separate
issue we'd have to run several tests to
verify or deny any claim relating to
that but yeah it'd be really cool Cole
says I think more minimal minimalist
minimalist designs are going
be more popular in the future man
probably I mean look AMD's kind of
already banking on that right with their
founders edition cards so well not
founders edition cards yeah I mean the
reference cards so it's possible it
could be possible let's see yeah
Quinn Valentino says stupid question man
there's no stupid question unless you're
trying to be stupid but you know this is
a genuine question would it be a stupid
idea to try and put a different cooler
on my GTX 10 80 gigabyte g1 gaming no
rgba gig card plagued by coil one coil
whine we have a video talking about coil
line uh house I almost pointed to a card
that's not going to show up type in
science to do coil line I talked about
what it is I had an issue with that in
my XPS 13 it is a board issue more than
likely you could have some sort of wine
coming from the fans someone from the
the bushings but it's probably going to
be a board issue and it's gonna be
really difficult to isolate that there
things like you can kind of like coat
some components like inductors on the
board with like a coating that prevents
them from rattling that's basically what
coil wine is when you run current
through them they may ride will they
make a lot of noise yeah it's that
high-pitched squeal you typically here
when cards are under load when power is
being pushed through those components
but it's gonna be a board issue more
than likely so I don't think changing
the shroud or changing the cooler on the
card is going to do you much good I hate
to say that you could try I mean if you
had some time on I've on a weekend you
want to try it out what the heck but I'm
just I don't want to get your hopes up
because I I don't think you're gonna be
too too surprised by the results
especially after after now let's see
yeah I just saw Will's picture on
Twitter will is ready for some pub G
well half the place in pub G after this
okay I'm waiting for somebody something
like I don't know why my I got fiber I
have like gigabit internet and I can't
even load in some of these pictures or
maybe it's just your account may not be
allowed to a form to perform this action
I can't open a picture from somebody
tweeting at me well see anyway we're
gonna go back here just want to make
sure
I'm gonna scroll through Wow plenty of
entries now you guys this is awesome
stuff here is more more content more
stuff show off so I'm going through
these making sure there's nothing weird
and yeah looking good okay so I'm gonna
pivot back to the screen and we're gonna
go back down here all the way back down
to one of our last ones was I believe
the Titan may be a Titan card yep so we
have you can't really see it here
Eddie's wanting us to rate his first
build looking good looks like you read
all the cables in the right spot so
that's nice you had one of those power
supplies I had like the not daisy chain
you know what I mean there's like the
connected VGA cables I know exactly what
I know how big of a pain those are to
deal with and I'll actually like what
you did there yeah it looks like you
took a zip tie and you just tied it down
so it didn't hang awkwardly it's
actually a pretty clever idea I like
that looks like you got something
similar to a hyper 212 Evo up there you
get two dims and everything's clean over
here just looking at this looks like a
pro not a Frank maybe a fractal piece I
don't know it's not a fractal case I
can't tell what kind of case it is but
look you did everything that you could
have done I think given the time that
you had in the space that you had in
parts that you had I do see this one
cable back here though yeah there yeah
you got this one cable this one small
okay what would its kind of bothering me
so maybe try to stuff this between the
the right side of that fan frame and
like the the rear i/o ports maybe if
there like a rear i/o shield you can
stuff it between that the fan frame kind
of work its way up and and plug it in
through something in the back if you're
plugging in straight up right there you
can still do something with that you can
tuck that in somewhere that's the only
thing I see now and that's being that's
me being picky so I think with what you
got there you didn't you didn't you did
very well so that's a nice build I'd
give that for what you got there another
seven and a half out of ten maybe an 8
out of 10 just in terms of what you had
to work with you know maybe not from
like an overall aesthetic quality it's
not the prettiest looking bill just cuz
you know it's just a it's just a hyper
212 Evo pretty generic graphics card but
again you you work with what you
so I like that I'd give you a higher
rating than the other guys that I read
it nothing nothing personal let's see
here Kyle tuned sapphire rx 580 well how
do you guys like these sapphire cards
alright this is this isn't we good
feedback for them if they watch this
video so this is looking good
the the two fan design again looks like
a shroud I'm not sure these are actual
indents or not I had one of these cards
I just don't remember if it was like if
you could actually feel the rivets in
the shroud or not none then these look
like maybe 80 to 100 mill fans so I
looking good you can see the heat pipes
there on the side nickel plated copper
as always looking good alright let's see
what else we got here oh yeah can't go
without mentioning this one I think this
right here is probably the most clever
thing that gigabyte could have done with
these cards remember I was talking about
right the graphics cards needed to set
themselves apart aesthetically and
gigabyte just hit the nail on the head
here I really like this the only reason
why I don't think this is the most
beautiful design overall and I'm talking
about RGB LEDs everything else is
because the shroud itself I mean I
understand they wanted to pretty much
open it up entirely for you to be able
to see because there's only one LED per
fan so there's not like it's not like
there's an LED on every fin it's just
one fin that there's an LED on per fan
and the fan spins so fast and they all
kind of sync up through the software
that you can actually run cool designs
and transitions with them so yeah I know
this isn't a cheap card by any means I'm
actually working on painting one of
these why you haven't seen my app review
quote-unquote review of it yet but when
I get it painted white it should look
super sick so we'll see but anyway yeah
I like this I like this design a lot
it's just the shroud is just a little
weird for me that that's all that's the
only reason why I didn't say it was my
favorite y'all saw MSI r-tx card look at
that look at that six pin plus an eight
pin plus and is that another six pin or
I think it's another eight pin I'm
pretty sure but yeah that's another
excuse me good-looking one from em aside
the the trio the gaming yeah gaming
extra oh come on up here we have another
gtx 1070 EVGA six 3.0 cooler I always
loved the 1070 s I really do like these
cards a lot scrolling up again we got
the out here miss my card okay that's as
cool yeah I have a couple five eight
that are like this I like the dragon
design I like the backplane I think this
is it's a clean looking back plate here
and then he missed I also did a good job
with the shroud as well it's nothing
super fancy but you know it's a typical
black and red MSI fashion nice fans with
those really slanted blades their cards
run pretty cool as well we go on old
school absolutely a terrible choice for
most users but it looks amazing yeah I'm
not sure I agree with you on that one
um just gonna be honest it just doesn't
look that appealing to me that's just my
that's just my opinion blower style
cards from Galax that's cool and all but
like what the heck is this crap going on
here I just don't I don't get it anyway
it might be like a vintage option for
for some people but yeah I mean and we
have another picture here from from his
rig this is that g12 bracket again
looking really good
7700 you lidded 5 gigahertz nice build
my dude I like this black and red color
scheme you did really good with this one
and another one Matthew likes the Strix
cards I agree the Strix do look good
again just apart from that small little
caveat with the RGB sync up there right
this this color here will be slightly
different than the r2bees here like do
you want these to be white this would be
slightly bluish it just it always
bothered me with that series of card I'm
not sure where this one went it's just a
Brown image I even clicked on it and
there was really nothing there so sorry
pio pio trade you have you say that name
Dan Smith here we go the titan Jedi so
that's what I want to see a picture of
these he's like really cool it's just
like you know I'm like a basically if
you're a fanboy or fan girl or whatever
Star Wars and this is I mean come on
like this is this is pretty sweet I
would just I want one of these just
because you know if just because it has
some connection to to the Star Wars
series like anything Star Wars related
its kind of gonna be pretty expensive
and 5200 years and then also the ROG 22
TI matrix okay yeah this is looking nice
here I have not seen this card before
actually
and what aces has been doing now that is
with the the the cheaper r-tx cards as
well you see the fan blades are
connected to the frames so I want to run
some tests to see if this is actually a
good idea or not but I mean
I don't think it's gonna be too big a
deal they might be slightly more
turbulent but that's a good design I
would say that's a really clean design I
have another sapphire card here this is
a sapphire nitro Vegas 64 card in that
looking good I like what you did there
with those cables you know when you
don't have a custom cut out down there
for four cables or maybe you don't have
a basement at all this is an option and
I like what you did with that looking
good that's from broken token network
and then Edward o-5 old 8800 ultras in
SLI my friend yeah not sure I agree with
you on that but if you again if you have
a I don't know you have a thing for old
school stuff and certainly this is a
contender just not my cup of tea and
then now let's see here we have an RT x
27 t and this one another EVGA card EVGA
cards always look good we saw a few more
of those earlier and Nathan wants us to
rate his build so you got the cooler
master half alright and you get that big
old fan dude I'm not sure if that's like
dust or what but if it's dust you better
clean that up and then look at the
inside here cool small cool like you got
like a 27 and then you got like this I
can't tell what platform this is but it
doesn't look new and dual intelligent
processors - I wish I could see more
writing I feel like it's blocked you got
this TR - rx 850 watt power supply down
here from Thermaltake okay and then yeah
I mean you gotta clean it up dude like
you got dust everywhere that's that's my
biggest gripe with this one you got
cables kind of strode out like pull all
that back tuck all that in you know take
some time and clean it up but I'm gonna
go a long way maybe upgrade this CPU
cooler I'm sure you don't need it this
older platform but you know like if you
put like a a top flow cooler that look
really cool we'd have a fan just like
facing you that'd be nice that would be
something that I'd consider if you had
them if they had the budget for it
another EVGA 1080i looking good and then
we'll wants to play a pub G so I hope
you guys enjoyed a little bit of fun
with this one something a little
different I just wanted to I don't know
I want to dice up these live streams a
little more we do the Q&amp;amp;A is pretty much
every time we live stream
we've been doing them for way this is
like our 36th episode now so I
appreciate you guys watching we have
about 300 people watching that is
awesome I encourage you guys if you have
time and you miss stuff earlier in the
segment to rewind when this is archived
check out some of the GPU shrouds a
graphics card travels we were looking at
and just kind of express your opinions
in the comment section below
interesting to to see what you guys
think about those the old ones and the
new ones because there's a lot of a lot
of differences between the old cards and
the new ones the trends have changed
definitely so it's interesting to to go
back and reminisce and then also look
forward to the future
designs as well so I'm gonna answer a
few more questions it's about 10:00 p.m.
I don't want to stream too far past
10:00 p.m. but if you guys have
questions then I encourage you to drop
those in the chat box now before we get
out of here you can see will is spamming
the discord link if you are not a member
of the discord I don't know what I mean
I don't know like I I don't know why
you're not like you should be it's
totally free won't charge anything for
access to it or anything like that you
can join it you can chat with myself
chat with Bryan from tech yeah City you
can chat with will man will behind the
scenes and we can play some games
together it's basically all we do on the
discord so if you enjoy doing stuff like
that just kind of goofing off I think
that's it
nicholas is asking where pepsi is she's
not in this room usually she's in this
room but she's not she's not currently
so I think I'm kind of glad because when
she's in here and I'm talking like
making a lot of noise or whatever I'm
moving and filming and building she's
always kind of like what what's going on
what's going on she'll like walk through
stuff she'll like walk inside the
computer cases I can't get in there I'm
gonna pull her out she'll bite cables
she's in that like adolescent stage
right now she's like a borderline
teenager and cat years so it's just pain
but yeah McLovin of president 2020
mclubbe of a president I see you guys
see you guys
I'll make sure Jacob sees those I'm sure
he'll appreciate it
Jarek top five white cases I don't have
five cases in my head right now I don't
wanna drag it out too long but I would
say my two or three favorite ones if I'm
we're talking about all-white cases I
like the leniently PCO limit dynamic why
that's one of my favorite cases today in
the price category for sure I also like
the the s340 it was a really good white
case I think yes 340 elite was it was a
good just like the next logical step
like I said in my review of the IH 500
the H 500 also looks good in white it's
not a totally white case though there
are a few others but the the Leone case
comes to mind first that to me is just
like one of the best looking white cases
on the market that's see silver says ah
so your fluff monster likes to clam and
your case is - uh I don't know what is I
feels like being in like a cave you know
it makes them feel secluded like they
they have control over their environment
a little more I think it's probably what
it is you know they're like curious
anyway like climbing on top of stuff and
trying to figure out what's going on mr.
cave gaming he says man I basically
missed the show I've missed it for the
past what seems like two months now
shame on me shame on you mr. KF gave me
I'm just kidding I I owe you can always
go back and watch that this is actually
really cool opposite I think you'll
enjoy the stuff we talked about we were
looking at graphics card shrouds
basically the whole episode so if this
is archived but will be archived fairly
soon you can go back if you have some
time and scrub through that let's see
you're scrolling up up up up up up let's
see here yeah good night says he likes
the cooler master eh 500 M yeah that's a
good one as well I have actually did a
review on that as well I built in it
it's a nice case it's just a little too
big for me I think it's just when cases
get that big and they're I don't know I
don't have enough hardware to fill all
that space stuff it just kind of bothers
me that's why I like the smaller mid
tower case is like the S 340 the mesh if
I see now even though the 11 dynamic not
because it's it has a lot of space a lot
of water cooling room but you can fill
it up very easily with some fans you can
turn your graphics card sideways it
pretty much takes up that whole you know
left compartment there so anyway you
guys have been awesome if you guys want
to play pub G with us I'm sure we're
gonna jump on here very soon I gotta
turn the AC on it's boiling in here I
appreciate you guys watching sorry about
staring at the screen the whole time and
reading comments as I go but you guys
have been awesome again I do appreciate
you taking time out of your Sunday night
or Monday to hang out with us and be
sure to leave a comment down below if
you want the comment to be permanent
because it's going to disappear in the
chat but
yeah you guys are awesome I appreciate
it and we'll be doing this again next
week I am going where I'm actually
taking Lisa on a long-overdue honeymoon
so we're gonna be out for about 10 days
starting the beginning of the next week
not this week but the next week so after
this next Sunday we'll be out for about
a week or so I'm gonna try to get some
content lined up for you guys I won't be
here to really monitor much of it but so
I won't be as active in the comments but
hopefully you guys have some time to
watch those videos as well I'll try to
make them juicy for yes and somewhat
entertaining and not not as
controversial really because I for
controversial videos I like to be there
like I like to read comments and I
understand why people are saying what
they're saying and sometimes I'll argue
with them sometimes I'll clarify
something I said in the video that needs
clarification so we'll try to do
something more fun while I'm gone so
it's not too stressful on my end but
anyway stay tuned for that stuff you
guys have been awesome I will catch you
in the next video coming up here very
soon I expect Tuesday and then again for
our final live stream before I'm out for
a week so yep keep staying pretty and
we'll talk again very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
