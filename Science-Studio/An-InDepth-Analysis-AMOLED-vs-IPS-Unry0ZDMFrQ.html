cool in their new p7c one mid tower
computer case with integrated RGB
lighting and a tempered glass side panel
I'll actually be reviewing the case very
soon check out links in the video
description for more details we're gonna
jump right into the science of this one
what's the difference between OLED and
IPS what's the difference between OLED
and AMOLED for that matter and why have
larger mainstream displays taken so long
to adopt OLED technology welcome to our
crash course playlist I remember my
first ever cell phone it actually wasn't
too long ago to be frank in middle
school I never owned a flip phone the
Motorola razors were pretty hot back in
that time we're talking like mid to late
2000s my first phone ever was actually
in 2011 I want to say and it was a Nexus
S when I hit high school i clenched my
big boy pants and bought one off
contracted sported half a gig of ram 5
megapixel camera and a Super AMOLED
display that was the the all that was
what I was so intrigued about with Super
AMOLED technology was the infinite
contrast ratio because each pixel
produces its own light and then the
really bright yellow toggles if I
remember correctly from Gingerbread
old-school Android but the colors were
supersaturated and whites looked oddly
warm look the technology's aged well but
some of these characteristics are still
present in modern day AMOLED displays so
how do they work this one's gonna get
pretty technical
first off AMOLED stands for
active-matrix organic light-emitting
diode it describes a single pixel in a
display generating its own light using a
flat film cathode anode array with a
conductive layer of organic material
sandwiched in between now how does this
all work
right this is just a bunch of technical
jargon in a nutshell this is a diode
which is a one-way current valve TFTs or
thin film transistors scatter the
substrate and deliver varying electrical
signals depending on the picture shown
typically two TF T's per pixel store
current in a charging capacitor and
control voltage output to the pixel and
it's discharging that makes AMOLED so
friendly for battery life in fact that's
what makes amoled amoled passive OLED x'
marketed in older products like mp3
players require additional voltage since
no charge capacitor is present hence the
passive charging they're usually just
called
all the displays because it sounds a lot
better than pima led most tech using
OLED technology today though including
phones and TVs uses active matrix
displays so think of each pixel as its
own triple light bulb config with its
own power source when the screen needs
to be brighter more current is supplied
to each that's pretty rudimentary but
the material comprising the substrate of
each section of the pixel determines its
color it's like that for most LEDs out
there aluminum gallium indium phosphate
for red LEDs and indium gallium nitride
for blues and greens when OLED displays
need to depict white all substrates
illuminate according to the screens
color calibration and when it needs to
depict black all current is shut off
providing that infinite contrast ratio
for which all the displays are so well
regarded additionally viewing angles are
spectacular since cathode anode
sandwiches are so thin just throw a
gorilla glass panel atop and you're all
set now in the case of IPS technology an
individual pixel does not produce its
own light that's usually what people
will say when they're trying to describe
the difference between IPs and AMOLED
standing for in-plane switching it
represents an attempt to improve
previous TN LCD downfalls including
trash viewing angles and inaccurate
color reproduction modern IPS panels are
still active matrix panels in the same
way AMOLED screens are utilizing charge
capacitors but they rely on an LED
backlight for illumination instead of
the substrate sandwich OLED displays use
IPS pixels use LCS or liquid crystals to
control the flow of light from the
source underneath usually an LED or CCFL
that's why this is called IPS LCD
technology they're aligned with the
surface of the glass above and are
oriented in such a way to block light
from the source which is ultimately
never shut off when more current is
applied to a pixel from two electrodes
underneath the liquid crystals twist up
to 90 degrees
hence inter plane switching to allow for
more or less light to pass through the
glass substrate depending on the
calibration TN panels typically require
current to close rather than open so
it's backwards they're polarizer
straighten the light into uniform lines
and color filters shade the light into
red green and blue tints picture this
process for the three sub pixels that
comprise an RGB array red images will
only result in an LC shift under the red
substrate for example white activates
all three and black keeps the crystals
oriented in-plane with the glass
preventing most of the light underneath
from passing through it won't fully cut
off the light
which is why you have some extent of
backlight bleed and a contrast ratio
that is not infinite so these are the
technologies in a nutshell and I have
the Xiaomi me six in the one plus five
to depict the pros and cons of each
technology the me six has a beautiful
1080p IPS display colors are accurate
sharp and vivid although for most IPS
panels viewing angles are excellent this
ones aren't too great I realized that
after the fact in fact this is one of
the best IPS implementations I've ever
seen with that exception but this isn't
foolproof contrast ratios are excellent
but not infinite as you should expect
with this technology so you'll be able
to see a bit of the backlight bleeding
through this isn't usually a deal
breaker but it is evident even when the
crystals are in-plane with the glass
also the displays brightness is slightly
dimmer than that of the AMOLED
counterpart on the 1 + 5 since both
electrodes and IPS pixels are placed
below the LCS less light is allowed to
pass between them from the backlight
source and that backlight is the
Achilles heel here the DOP 5s OLED
display by contrast presents slightly
oversaturated coloring this is perhaps
most noticeable in the red coloring for
AMOLED displays the YouTube logo here is
supersaturated whereas the me6 offers a
subtle interpretation additionally a
depiction of black here results in an
absolute shut off of the pixel or pixels
in question and because there's no
backlight the contrast is literally
infinite no light will be emitted from
these zones apart from the over
saturation though OLED displays are
disadvantageous in a few other respects
for one as brightness of the display
increases its depiction of white becomes
less accurate as shown in this graph
white backgrounds consume significantly
more power in AMOLED displays an IPS one
since all sub pixels must be set to max
brightness whereas IPS technology
provides consistent lighting from the
backlight underneath so manufacturers
will often limit the brightness of some
sub pixels in these AMOLED displays to
conserve battery life adversely
affecting white balance OLED displays
also experience some degree of burnin
over time since the light source and
thus heat source is much closer to the
phosphor coating under the glass
it's mitigated well in today's
technology but the same Nexus as I told
you about earlier suffered a great
degree of burnin after about a year's
use now in my opinion AMOLED is the
superior technology and extremely mobile
devices like cell phones I love the
infinite contrast ratios and I'm usually
okay with the over saturation
calibrated to an extent in most
smartphones nowadays anyway but for
laptops and desktops I've got to say I
enjoy IPS a bit more particularly
Apple's iteration of this technology and
their Retina displays the color
reproduction is insane a huge plus for
content creators their displays also
appear softer on the eyes just hold an
iPhone 7 next to a galaxy device and
you'll see what I mean it's really all
preferential this is just what I
personally prefer with my mobile devices
