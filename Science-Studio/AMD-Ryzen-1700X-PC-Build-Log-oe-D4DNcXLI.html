to see it for yourself
you take the blue pill the story ends
you wake up in your bed and believe
whatever you want you take the red pill
you stay in Wonderland and I show you
how deep the rabbit-hole goes
so the first thing I want to do is of
course run through all of the parts that
will comprise my first-ever AMD rise in
PC build not starting of course with the
AMD rising CPU this is the 1700 X still
an 8 core 16 thread processor should get
some decent overclocks thanks to or deep
cool captain 240 X this is the black and
red version they also have a white and
blue version which I've showcased in
several videos in the past this should
allow us to maybe get around a three
point three point nine gigahertz
overclock not if we're lucky with it but
this should keep things nice and cool
and nice and quiet now to house our CPU
is the asrock X 370 Taichi may have
heard of the Taichi variable for I use
the X 99 Taichi in project blue sky this
is the X 370 variant which is good for
any AM for CPU especially this bad boy
right here eight core 16 threads we
should get a hefty overclock with this
motherboard here this is one of the best
you can buy one of the best looking in
my opinion as well sixteen phase power
delivery systems all the works will go
through to more detail your shortly but
this is a board that comes highly
recommended here in the studio for the
graphics card I stole a gtx 1070 from
heisenberg this is a run-of-the-mill
EVGA gtx 1070 it's not even an SC or for
the win Edition card but it is custom
painted white I did that myself the I
think I have an instruction kind of
thing video here we'll check that out
this normally comes in black but a 1070
is plenty I would say for the 1700 X
you'll see that in the benchmarking
video where I face off this Rison build
against Heisenberg that'll be
interesting at 1070 verse of 1070 the
main difference being 1700 X versus the
6700 K another component of the xlr8
line up the 960 gigabyte SSD this is a
behemoth to one terabyte virtually
solid-state drive good for operating
system and general storage and things of
that sort
plenty of storage for PC like
I recommend at least that around half a
terabyte if you can get by without you
know packing many games into the drive
but one terabyte should be plenty for
what we intend to do with this system a
team group with super cool they wanted
to show off their rog certified ddr4
these are t4 stims here they come in to
eight gig packs so we have a full of 32
gigabytes here and they are running it
three gigahertz it looks like with a
casa latency 1618 1838 at one point
three five volts good for any modern
platform these are also red which will
of course match our red black and white
theme which is good to see and shouldn't
have a problem of you know pretty much
any pair of dims that you go with any
quad-channel dingy go with will be okay
and as long as they're decent reviews
and these have worked out very well for
me in the past I have no problem again
going with team group for this Verizon
PC build now for the epic combo the
course their premium PSU cable kit
individually sleeve red cables and
that's our red theme good for any
modular course their power supplies
listed on the box and that power supply
of choice is the RM 750 X 80 plus gold
power supply fully modular super quiet
not going to have any problems in this
department and lastly the course there
for 60 X which is a tempered glass
version of the Corsair 400 C which I
reviewed the video right there so check
that one out if you want to know more
about just like how the case is laid out
and things like that you'll see it more
in detail when we start building in the
case but this is beautiful includes
three RGB fans this is the RGB Edition
you see we have plenty of gets
capabilities up top and customized quite
a bit so integrated into the case
there's also a controller in the back
and yeah I think that's about it those
are the components I appreciate all the
companies willing to contribute to this
build we're going to have at it
and all right here is my first-ever
AMD risin PC build I do hope you
thoroughly enjoyed the tech porn you
just saw I do apologize for this band
right here it's the only one of the PC
that's exceptionally loud
I haven't properly calibrated the fan
curve yet here so it's kind of that
buzzing noise in the background but I do
think that the white red and black theme
turned out very well in this build the
Corsair 460 X is a beautiful case it is
kind of a major pain to work in it's not
the easiest to build in but the payout
and the end I think is top-notch of
course the classic color scheme here
makes things pop even more as well as
these three included RGB fans is what
you get when you purchase the 460 X or
RGB addition you can purchase other
variants of the case that include fans
that are only programmed for one color
the other thing I wanted to show you
that I mentioned in the beginning of
this video is that I don't have the
included a.m. for support bracket for
the captain - 40 X deep cool told me
that this date right here is when the
bracket will be available for Rison
builds but for now I kind of just threw
some rubber bands around the stock and
for a little bridge here and on the
bottom as well
not something I'd recommend in the long
run but it's doing okay so far it's
fairly stable not going to go anywhere
for now that's really all I'm worried
about and I think that this red fluid
along with the blacks 240 millimeter
radiator look absolutely stunning
and as promised here is the cinnamons
run starting right now and look at all
of those little threads render that
image now is actually very quick and our
cinnamon score is 16 46 it's actually a
very good score considering we were only
at three point eight gears that's the
frequency I think most people should be
able to obtain with the 1700 X we'll
investigate that more further but for
now thanks for watching the build blog I
am very much looking forward to
benchmarking this PC pitting it
head-to-head against good old Heisenberg
this is Salazar studio thanks for
building with us slopes I hid the camera
tripod there
