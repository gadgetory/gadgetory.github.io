too you may have seen a pre-roll look to
our channel about it and for good reason
we only promote products obviously that
we love and/or use and I absolutely love
the mesh if is too now before we get
carried away which is I mean it's easy
to do with this chassis I want to
preface this video by stating that I
don't intend to you know throw in the
deep dives no the case features like a
normally wooden review of this caliper
and that's because the mesh vs2 is a lot
like other mesh Rifai well not just
meshed for five cases this is a lot like
other fractal cases in general the mesh
if I see obviously is the more compact
version of this and then also the define
r6 which shares I believe the exact same
dimensions is the same chassis basically
and then just emphasizes a bit more
airflow whereas the define r6 was more
for hard drive support and staying more
stealthy overall the mesh is to
obviously features a large mesh front
panel nearly identical to the mesh
device ease as well as a large pop out
mesh panel up top with a push lock
mechanism at the rear similar to the
define our sixes
hardware support includes up to a 360 ml
fan rad combo up front as well as up top
and either a 120 or 140 ml combo at the
rear frak dough includes three beefy 140
mm fans with the mesh vs two they run
quiet and the all-black profile is nice
for these but the fans are only voltage
controlled no PW support now to
compensate a large fan hub is included
behind the motherboard tray with
dedicated three and four pin support I
normally you know count three Finn three
pin fans as negatives in 2019 especially
at this price point but the large pwm
fan hub more than makes up for this in
fact these three fans are likely all
you'll need even like an expensive build
like this so I'm not sure a stickler for
knock to Azure silent wings which by all
means I understand I would just stick
with these in here now I love the
inclusion of rubber grommets deserve my
favorite the large removable panel for a
longer rad extra fan or reservoir in
fact this is an excellent case for
liquid cooling in general you can mount
a res in this large panel you can also
mount it directly
the panel next to the motherboard tray
so if you want to put a 360 ml up here
and a reservoir there's plenty of room
for all of that including a very tall
reservoir it's an often overlooked
feature with mid towers like this one
that's why I'm mentioning it but if
you're looking for something smaller
than full ATX right to show off all the
custom loop goodies the mesh flats
s2 is a great candidate now on the rear
you'll find a 7 plus 2 slot config so
two vertical brackets if you're into you
know during a custom water block up here
PSU bracket and cutoff for loading units
from the rear which I prefer the 120mm
or 140mm fan mount a rear i/o cut out
and the top panel button that we
highlighted earlier
lastly behind the right panel you'll
find a three hard drive cage is secured
with thumb screws two dedicated SSD
trays included velcro straps and tie
points at all the right places it's
honestly a builder's paradise I know me
saying that sounds like I'm fanboying
pretty hard over this case but after
building in dozens upon dozens of these
things I can say with certainty that
this is one of the best I've reviewed
the attention to detail here is insane
and I really appreciate it
honestly it goes a long way an example
would be this tiny little cutout up here
above the rear i/o cutout instead of
just having to you know wrap your fan
cable across your motherboard and
through your EPS cutout which is gonna
be a bit big
you can discreetly hide your fan cable
through this tiny hole against the rear
of the chassis I love it it's a small
thing you probably will overlook it
until you're actually building it and I
mean surprise that's a fact okay for you
now another cool feature this case has
is near to list design for the left and
right panels the tempered glass on the
left side is only slightly tinted which
is nice and it simply snaps into place
I'm actually curious I never tried to
install the right panel into the left
panel spot see if I can do that and
that's probably not gonna work that well
just up there and then just that right
yes it fits okay cool so if you want to
I don't know if they sell these panels
separately but if you just want to close
off the case
and not have like a tempered glass panel
on here you can just put the right panel
over the left panel slot I assume you
could do the same by putting the
tempered glass panel on there
on the right panel slot that's that's
really weird but it's cool that just
shows you how functional the case is
overall yeah let's get this off all in
all I like the ease-of-use approach with
snapping on the panels and you can
secure them with thumb screws if you
wish now with that said there are a few
things I would change first
you can't remove the front basement
cover unless you remove the front panel
first that's not an issue in and of
itself the problem is the front i/o
wiring is connected to that front panel
so if you remove the front panel you
have to kind of mind those cables
because they're all kind of running to
that thing so yeah that's kind of
annoying I wish that the cables would
have been you know hardwired to a
separate little box that's attached to
the chassis and not necessarily that
front panel it's a little annoying but
it's again something you're gonna really
come across only once or twice if you
build in this thing just something to
keep in mind another thing I really
haven't liked lately about these larger
fractal cases I mean I know they're
supposed to be larger right for the hard
drives and whatnot that define our
sticks it made a little more sense with
and of course you want custom loop
support but I feel like there's a little
too much space between this is the large
graphics card from Asus right here this
is the 20 80 Strix and we still have
over six inches of space between the
front fans and the end of the graphics
card which extends past a typical ATX
motherboard on the contrary the Mesha 5c
is just a bit too compact for a lot of
people I mean this card plus a 360
Miller well 240 ml rat in that case
wouldn't fit this card is just too long
so we need like a healthy middle ground
and I think like this is a little too
long and the mesh if I see he's a little
too narrow from front to back so that's
just just might take honestly I'd like
to see a little more differentiation
between fractal products I understand
like they're not trying to reinvent the
wheel I mean the wheel works the way it
is so just keep going in this general
direction but the dimensions need to
change too just a little you need a
healthy middle ground something similar
to NZXT SH 500 right where there's just
a perfect amount of space there again
the message I see is a good option but
certain parts won't fit so maybe an inch
or two extra from that chassis would be
perfect I don't know I'm just throwing
out options I just think we could go
with something a little smaller than
this here but anyway enough with
features let's talk airflow it's no
secret the mesh turf is to emphasize
is this the word mesh it means literally
in the name and the resulting airflow is
spectacular compared to the
best-in-class fantex piece 600's the
mushroom is two yields identical load
cpu temperatures at 78 degrees Celsius
this is four degrees over the matric 70
from deep cool and six degrees over the
be quiet dark bass 700 they're all kind
of similarly priced the metric seven
metric 70 excuse me is much cheaper but
it's got a closed-off front panel so
there you go
so the metruff is - is tied for best
overall CPU temps the story changes
though for the graphics card the fant XP
600 s yields 65 degree GPU temperatures
while the mesh 5s2 gave 67 degrees
Celsius I mean sure it's a noticeable
Delta but it isn't like you know
life-threatening and if you look at our
other cases you'll find that this is a
pretty standard temperature things only
dropped by an additional two degrees
when the front panel was completely
removed which isn't alarming either so
this could be tied to the way we routed
the PCIe cables right maybe it's
blocking some of the air from this front
fan I don't know the piece of Center
desks offered a dedicated cut out for
those cables and this really doesn't so
that could be the the reason why we
could try locating this somewhere else
but I feel like the optimal position is
to run these cables into the rubber
grommet next to the motherboard so
that's why we left it there and I mean
come on 70 degrees Celsius for graphics
card or anything under that is already
good so how do we conclude then is this
my new favorite case no not really I
mean but that is really say much the
piaac Center - wasn't my favorite case
either the mesh ps2 is priced at 149
ninety-nine on Newegg which is exactly
the same price as the fantex
P 600 s so these two are definitely
targeting each other and then it makes
sense as for which I would choose that
ultimately comes down to the type of
build the mesh VST would probably better
for custom water cooling right because
it's got an elongated shape of the pay
the piece of centered s is just a bit
more flashy and stylish and I mean I
like the nylon a lot that's a really
cool implementation but I don't know I
like to look at cases the same way I
look at cars fractal cases are like
Bentley's I honestly believe this I know
I know we ran a few ads comparing this
to a Lambo kind of satirically but just
just roll with it
Baili chassis czar classy right the
frames are beautiful and roomy
sites are all spacious the internals are
functional and style the layout is
conventional to an extent on the other
hand modern fan text cases are a bit
more about flair the RGB integration for
example the grooves and the curves they
don't look like your run-of-the-mill
cases kind of like McLaren's
you buy those cars for different things
right Bentley's are easy to sit in and
they're extremely comfortable and
MacLaren's are sharp and fast you buy a
fan text case because it looks unique
it's like nothing else on the market you
buy a fractal case because it's
functional that's not to say that the P
600 s isn't I just think this is more
functional and in the case of the mesh
vs2 it's extremely functional cable
management in these cases is a dream it
was a dream even in the more compact
version the mesh if I see these cases
are not super flashy in that way but
whoever builds in the case knows that he
or she is building in a quality product
and that's what Franklin design offers
and you're paying for it I mean 150
bucks is not cheap but neither is the P
600 s so then which would you choose
that's the question like you'd answer in
