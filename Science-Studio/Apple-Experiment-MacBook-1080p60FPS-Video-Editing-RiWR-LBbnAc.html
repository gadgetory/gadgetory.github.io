iPhones I will do a separate video on
the SAE
coming up very soon but I want to I
guess talk today about the MacBook 2016
my first impressions I've I've had it
for about a week now and I've honestly
been enjoying it I've said that in the
comments I haven't made any secret of
that this is an absolutely beautiful
machine and I have zero buyer's remorse
I can say that with 100% confidence a
lot of you thought that I purchased this
for gaming that that is not what it was
purchased for I have that so what I want
to gain my game on that but when I'm
away out of the studio and I need to
edit on the go like for instance when I
was in Atlanta with McElveen we were
filming in those micro centers this
would have been so much nicer to have
than my cheap crappy would run over 100s
to edit on not only because it is more
powerful than the lenovo won addressed
by a long shot i can actually download
Cinebench i can even download Cinebench
on my laptop on the 100's but on here
i'm pushing about 200 ish CB which isn't
great it's a Core m3 processor if you
were worried about that but I will say
this thing runs Final Cut Pro like an
absolute champ so you know Final Cut
renders in the background while you're
actually working on your project so in
my case it takes about an hour to an
hour and a half to edit and render a
10-minute clip I do a lot of edits you
know little cutscenes here and there so
that takes a lot of time and the
animations are also time consuming I
can't do as much with Final Cut Pro but
this is a perfect solution for when I'm
on the go and that's what I'm going to
show you here a few of you were
concerned about the video editing
capabilities of the MacBook 2016 mainly
due to the fact that it's only sporting
a quorum 3 that the dual core hypothetic
processor but only running at 0.9
gigahertz which is underwhelming I mean
my iPhone SC is actually about as
powerful as this desktop processor which
is pretty sad and so on right but I do
have Final Cut Pro which is something
that most laptops that would be more
powerful than this will not take
advantage of so here's exactly why I
think I'm going to end up keeping the
MacBook 2016 and using it as my daily
out of the office drivers when I need to
edit on the go because Final Cut Pro
renders in the background and it takes
me about 45 minutes to an hour sometimes
an hour
I have to render a sizable video files
for YouTube I'm going to be okay I'm not
gonna have to wait that long for the
rest of the video to export after I
click the export button if I had
purchase something like a blade stealth
the razor blade stealth core i7 6500
view that still mind you a dual-core
hyper threaded processor so it's it's
got four threads but it's effectively
the same as this in terms of how many
cores it has and in fact it has
hyper-threading now it is a faster
processor in terms of frequency those do
take advantage of ddr4 this is only ddr3
with Core M chips but if you're using a
Razer Blade stealth you're gonna have to
use something like Adobe Premiere Pro
you could settle for Sony Vegas or even
DaVinci Resolve but my only other
alternative would be Adobe Premiere
because I know that one like the back of
my hand and I love the I guess
versatility of Adobe Premiere so if I
decided to use it every premiere on that
laptop it's not going to be an enjoyable
experience the i-765 hundred-year does
not score very well we're talking around
300 CB that's only about a 33%
improvement over a point nine gigahertz
core M processor so I could choose to go
with an underpowered laptop but that
will run Final Cut Pro like a champ and
render in the background and take a lot
of the load off of the final export
process or go for something like an i7
6500 II processor that will have ddr4
will be will have faster frequencies all
of that but will take considerably
longer to export an equivalent file
length because Adobe Premiere does not
render in the background and it's just
overall a bulkier program now obviously
if you are a very quick video editor it
takes you like ten minutes to throw a
bunch of clips together and you're rated
export Final Cut Pro is not going to be
able to render everything in the
background quick enough to the point
where when you click export it's just
kind of stitching everything together
last minute and it's going to take a
super short amount of time in this case
because I only was in Final Cut Pro for
about 10 to 15 minutes you could tell
where the background rendering had
stopped and where it was having to do
all the rendering immediately following
the export click so it noticeably slowed
down it took a lot longer we're looking
at 16 minutes here for a 10-minute video
file in 1080p 60 still not bad for Final
Cut Pro for a core m3 and keep in mind
ahead and head
time to render open through so a
10-minute video file it definitely would
have had time because it takes me a lot
longer than 10 minutes to go through all
of those clips but if I had done the
exact same thing in Adobe Premiere we'd
still be sitting here waiting for the
thing to finish exporting we're talking
30 40 minutes at least based on what I
have seen so far on several other sites
the benchmark and export in Adobe
Premiere files that are considerably
large with the core i7 6500 U or even a
core i5 which is just basically a lower
clock core i7 so that's so far as my
opinion on the MacBook you see I already
have a Microsoft Word Excel PowerPoint
all the stuff I need for school in class
I've been using it pretty much every day
you can tell in some cases when things
get a little boggy I'll show you an
example here so we'll open up for the
documents there's this very large file
it's actually a well log for my senior
design class okay it's this one right
here so this is a huge file it's
actually a PDF but it's an image saved
in the PDF format and every now and then
you can tell this computer struggles to
keep so you see the scrolling is fluid
up to a point and then it just kind of
lags behind little things like that you
can tell a higher clock speed would have
helped going for the M 5 processor
versus the m3 would have helped there
but that's an extra two three hundred
bucks I bought this laptop for $1000 so
go and hire that to me just really
wasn't worth it for what I need this
laptop to do I'm willing to wait a
little bit longer in terms of export
times for the sake of saving two to
three hundred bucks so things like this
it might struggle a bit more I don't
normally open up huge image files as
PDFs but you could definitely tell there
are limitations to device like this all
in all though I will say very good
experience so far the type C port is not
limiting for what I do
most of what I transfer is via the cloud
or I'll just use an email I'll just use
an email address and just send myself
the document via an email so I don't
really need an extension whatever dongle
right now I do have word I put it right
here I do have the type C two USB 3.1
thumb drive so if I ever need things
immediately transferred I can do that
from my desktop or wherever but for
right now I'm satisfied I'm okay with
the keyboard I'm getting over it the key
travel is something to get used to the
keys really dull
move much it almost feels like a
touchscreen if you can imagine that like
touching I don't know I guess you don't
get any key travels so it feels like
you're just touching metal and just
responding like like tapping on a screen
but that's that's kind of what this is
you get used to it it's not something
that I recommend for everybody but if
there's a compromise I'm willing to make
to have a sleek profile something that's
very portable and the battery life is
something else I wanted to touch on very
quickly battery life I've been getting a
full day at least sometimes I can I can
go for two days total I've had it to
where I'll use it all day in class I'll
watch youtube videos in the afternoon
and I go to sleep I have 55 percent
battery life so like I'll just make it
last till tomorrow afternoon and it does
it does that admirably and I've been
running it on half brightness the entire
time so I think going any higher than
that would probably be detrimental to
overall battery life in a significant
way so that's it folks that is the I
guess the current state of affairs with
the MacBook 2016 here in the studio
I do recommend this product to pretty
much any college student who's willing
to make a few compromises in terms of
operating system capabilities it is it
does have a learning curve it's not
something you can just pick up and just
figure out right away it took me about
two and a half hours to figure out that
a two finger tap was equivalent to a
right-click on a trackpad that's that's
how much of a newb I was four or five
days ago but I'm learning very quickly
if your computer guy or know anything
about operating systems it's really not
that difficult you will have things that
you'll have to look up on Google you
know like I had to look up how to record
my screen on this so using QuickTime so
I record my screen using QuickTime
simple google search I know that from
now on I'll have to do is open up
QuickTime and go up into the window and
then click a click record screen or the
file record screen I'm still learning it
anyway folks this is the end of part two
I hope you at least appreciate the fact
that I was only to switch out right just
for the sake of the channel just for the
sake of showing you all I guess a
different side to computers so Apple is
different on purpose they want to be
different because oh they're Apple and
you guys know what that entails I know a
lot of you up front just were like ah
blah Apple blah blah people say that
about Samsung to love Samsung blah blah
or Windows Bob I don't know once you go
Mac you never go back that's what they
say at least and as of right now I don't
plan on switching back to
anything else anytime soon zero buyer's
remorse even though I spent a good chunk
of change on this I could have gotten an
equivalent laptop from Windows for about
seven hundred bucks I know I know you're
kind of paying for the ecosystem all
does that sound familiar a lot of Apple
guys say ecosystem I never really knew
what that meant when people set it back
in the day but now I kind of do now that
I own Apple products I see what they
mean it is a good ecosystem it's a
different it's a different experience
altogether you don't feel like you're
using a laptop I don't know it's hard to
explain it feels like it's it's it's
just a different type of computer
because of the operating system the way
this thing is just built it's just it's
a beautiful laptop even if you hate
Apple you have to admit this is a
beautifully designed laptop and that's
part of what you're paying for it to be
completely honest you're paying for
build quality you're paying for for the
looks for the for the logo all of that
goes into it so thousand bucks
I'm not remorseful yet I don't think
that's going to change I think it would
have happened already if I was going to
feel remorseful I do feel a little
bitter about the fact that they released
the new Apple watch and they're selling
it for about the same price it's
waterproof and I think it's got a
thousand nits of screen brightness
that's pretty awesome I might take you
back and get that one I don't know yet
SC I'm keeping that I am buying the
iPhone 7 I want a headphone jack that's
pretty much how it's going to be and I
like small phones it's actually a big
big change from my note 4 but I really
like this size I think it's a perfect 4
inches is a good size for a phone screen
in my opinion of course pretty much
everything I said in this video is my
opinion but that's kind of the point I
want to give you my perspective you guys
know how I am with computers I'm a big
windows guy big a Android guy I do kind
of miss Android but I'm very happy that
I'm in the Apple ecosystem now whoops if
you liked this video give it a thumbs up
give it a thumbs down if you feel
complete opposite or if you hate
everything about life be sure to click
the subscribe button if you haven't
already stay tuned for well part 4 of
the CPU core series and I guess we'll
move on other stuff I have an i3 6100 PC
Bell coming very soon you follow me on
Twitter you already knew that
this is science to do oh by the way I
did it this entire video on the MacBook
could you tell well other than the fact
that I couldn't include Adobe fonts
probably the only only way you could
have could have been able to tell yeah
anyway see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
