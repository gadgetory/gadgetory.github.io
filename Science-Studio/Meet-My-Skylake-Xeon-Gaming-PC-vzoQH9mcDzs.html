totally different scene right so this is
my new studio source while I'm back here
in Florida and you'll be seeing this for
the next three or so months before I
move back to Louisiana and get back
situated into that office style format
but for now this is what it will be like
you may have seen the Marshall cat
insects that were behind me in the GT
extent any video I've lived a few days
ago I have since moved that entire stack
over there it's on that side of the room
so it's just kind of chilling there
sorry I know you guys were into that I I
didn't really even think much about it
but I actually received more comments
about the Marshalls than I did about the
1080 and that was a little strange but
for now I'm gonna have the monitor here
the computer here and I have a receiver
here because I have a 5.1 surround sound
system hooked up to the computer and
I'll detail that all another video what
I want to talk about in this video is
the Xenon 1230 v5 this is a skylight
base processor so we're talking 40
nanometers transistor design and it's
been thrown into the rig behind me the
motherboard I have in there is an Asus
III programming v5 now this is one of
the only motherboards that the CPU is
compatible with if look specifically for
C 232 motherboards and this is one of
them a downside to using this kind of
motherboard with a xeon processors the
fact that you're limited to 21 33
megahertz ram not like that's it you
can't really overclock your ram at all
this is giel super loose ddr4 have been
here and it's factory clocked to 2400
megahertz but when I went to set it
manually and even turn on XMP profile
the computer straight up refused to boot
this motherboard is also refurbished I
saved about 35 bucks going for the
refurbished version I'll have the link
to this motherboard in particular in the
video's description if it's no longer
available and you know new a takes it
down it's not refurbished anymore let me
know in the comments and I'll take the
link out but for now if you want to
build something like this
I do recommend this board I think it's
nicest looking of all the boards offered
and it's it's relatively cheap if you're
looking at the refurbished version of
this apart from that I'm calling
everything with a Kraken X 60 from NZXT
this is my second X 60 that I purchased
off of new egg and both of these have
been refurbished you pick them up
currently for $89.99 US dollars on new
egg if they're still available and this
cooler appears to be brand new both of
them were sealed I know they reseal on
themselves but they've done a great job
at making these things look brand new
and I both have been very reliable so
far there
also decently discounted when you've
taken to a consideration the fact that
the x61 is still around 130 hundred 40
bucks you're getting a $40 discount for
a cooler that cools almost the same as
the X 61 so consider that I did receive
one without the mounting gear but if you
follow me on Twitter you'll know that
NZXT was very cool about hooking me up
with that gear sending it to day
shipping and it was great so that's why
I purchased another one and that's the
one that's in this rig and it's working
out pretty well so far if you're
wondering what kind of graphics card I
have in here no it's not a GTX 970 it's
a gtx 960 gigabyte windforce g1 gaming
edition graphics card yeah a lot of you
are probably thinking Greg you threw a
fork or a thread Zeon beast essentially
an i7 into a computer with a gtx 960
really i mean not even an r9 380 what
are you doing i ever actually have two
reasons for this the first reason was
that I got this thing refurbished for a
really good price a hundred and eighty
bucks we're talking a four gig gtx 960
these usually go for about 220 $230 I
got this one refurbished and it's great
I'm a big fan of refurbished products by
the way if you can't already tell in
most cases you can just return them if
they're not functional but usually
you'll get a pretty good steal on a
product that will work just as fine and
look just as good as a brand new product
brand new version of the same product so
that was my first reason but also I plan
on replacing this card entirely with one
of the two new Pascal Nvidia cards I'm
not sure which one I'm going to pick yet
a lot of you have been telling me that
you want to see a review of the 1070 and
not necessarily 1080 just because a 1070
seems like a better deal so if you're
talking around Titan X performance for
about 400 bucks maybe that's the one
I'll throw in there I want to hear from
you guys in the comments which one you
would like for me to put into this rig
but I do plan on pairing the Xeon fork
or a thread processor with one of the
one of the other either the 1070 or the
1080
I finally moved on from my 320 gig
Western Digital caviar blue drive to a
one terabyte Western Digital caviar
black drive so we're talking performance
we're talking a quiet hard drive and
much more storage for these extra games
that I've been downloading GTA 5 is 65
or so gigabytes that is such a big game
everyone in the house had to turn off
all of their Wi-Fi devices I was
draining everything that there was such
a big bottleneck throughout the house
when it came to Wi-Fi because I was
sucking down so much juice to download
these games but most of them are
downloaded and speaking of which that's
what I want to do next so we're going to
run some benchmarks on this computer
here some synthetics and then we'll run
some gaming benchmarks see how well the
seon does when paired with the gtx 960
and then also a GTX 970 which I have in
a box somewhere over there I'm going to
throw that in here and then I run the
same benchmarks again just to see what
kind of Delta we should expect between
the tube given that we're not really
going to be experiencing much of a CPU
bottleneck at all so you're the
benchmarks
I really love this processor now it's
not overclockable it does have turbo
boost but it's not overclockable like
our 6600 k was so that's why a lot of
those benchmarks mimic those from that
i-5 but apart from that I mean you're
only paying 20 bucks more for a
processor that has twice as many threads
now you are limited in terms of the
motherboard availability but you can you
can kind of customize that I painted my
heatsink so I will show you that in a
future video if it's not in the card
above me already but you can certainly
make things look a little better than
they already do I didn't mention the
case for this build but this is another
fan text eclipse p400 this is the black
version this time I just wanted to
reiterate the fact that this is my new
favorite mid tower case I'm in love with
it it's basically an NZXT s340 without
the little shield in front of course but
you also get built-in LEDs that can
change colors I'm gonna light set on red
but you can change them to practically
whatever you want to match the colors
inside of your PC I'm using a deep cool
kit so this is basically a little
upgrade from the logis kit that i
featured in the video in the cart above
me so instead of getting one strip you
get two strips and that's why it's
making a little L shape here so it's a
little brighter inside and I do prefer
this deep cool kit over the largest this
one so I might do a review on those in
particular everything else I think looks
really great this is one of my favorite
builds if you guys think that I should
paint this graphics card white like I
did my GTX 970 let me know and maybe
I'll throw a video up detailing how to
do that specifically these gigabyte
graphics cards are very difficult to
take apart it's not as easy as just
unscrewing the backplate you have to
take apart the entire thing before you
even get the backplate off to paint
so all that kind of culminates into a
very difficult process
if you have any questions about the rig
be sure to leave those in the comments
sections love will check all of those
out did I not mention anything though oh
the power supply 600 Y 80 plus bronze
from EVGA is in there that this whole
build sips on power the Xeon is a very
low TDP instead of the 960 so we're
talking maybe a 350 watt total power
draw from the wall under full load which
is very low considering the power that
this PC packs give the video a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw if you liked
the new setting and you liked the new
style of videos that have been going on
recently on the channel give the video a
thumbs down if you just hate everything
about life be sure to click the
subscribe button if you haven't already
and say
for some pretty cool tutorials I think
I'm going to show you guys a few things
particularly how to paint those heat
sinks which I've already filmed up top
and then maybe how to paint the graphics
card if y'all are into that
this is science studio thanks for
learning with us
