verse I 360 100 review that's coming
very soon I knew I keep saying that but
if it's coming very soon in the meantime
hey everyone great here with science
studio and what we will do in the
meantime is we're going to compare the
new Intel i3 6100 to the AMD FX 6300 so
I understand that the FX series is very
popular it was very popular when it
first came out and it still is to the
stage because it's cheap and it's
powerful but how powerful is it and is
it more powerful than Intel's newest i3
2 core 4 thread processors so I know
right out of the gate you're probably
thinking well the FX 6300 has six cores
it's a hexa core processor it has a lot
more processing power right I mean even
if the CPU frequencies don't match six
courses is always better than four cores
right or two cores and four threads
right so the test we're going to run
fall into two different categories the
first three tests that we have are going
to be CPU independent so that means that
the GPU really won't be doing anything
at all it will just stress the CPU
itself and the three tests that we've
chosen are one the Cinebench CPU tests
so we'll be using Cinebench r15 just to
do raw CPU performance test the
Geekbench 3 software so we'll just be
doing the cheap 32-bit let's not native
cheap it's free the free 32-bit
Geekbench 3 tests so we'll be able to
test the single core performance and the
multi-core performance of each processor
and then we've also kind of put together
a little adobe premiere rendering test
so I have a 1-minute video file and I
rendered it through both machines and I
just recorded the times that it took to
render the same file on both and then we
chose three games we chose dying light
grand theft auto 5 and dota 2 in those
cases highest FPS wins simple as that
and you'll see why we chose those three
games here in a second so the test
benches for both of these CPUs are going
to be completely different there's just
nothing we can do about it one uses ddr3
one uses ddr4 one uses an am3+ socket
and one uses an LGA 1151 socket so
there's no way to compare them equally I
mean that's what you get for comparing a
four-year old processor with a 1-year
old processor it's just that's just what
you have to deal with but for the AMD
processor our test bench
consists of the following we used an
Asus m5 1897 revised 2.0 motherboard so
this is an am3+ socket motherboard and
we also threw in two four gigabyte
sticks of ddr3 clocked at 1600 megahertz
which is kind of the run-of-the-mill
ddr3 frequency so nothing really
outlandish there and the other thing to
note is that we did overclock the CPU to
4 gigahertz now before you freak out
we also overclock the i3 to 4 gigahertz
as well and if you're wondering how on
earth I overclock and i3 check out this
video here and I will show you how to do
that not really difficult at all if you
have a z170 motherboard but ok anyway on
the intel side of things i will be using
my personal rig this one right here so
this has an asrock z170 pro for LGA 1151
motherboard in it and we also have 2 4
gigabyte sticks as well but this time of
ddr4 and these are clocked and we make
sure get this right
these are clocked at 2346 megahertz for
a total of 8 gigabytes also in dual
channel now if you're wondering why the
ram frequency is a bit funky well it has
to do with the fact that I overclock
using the base clock method so when I
turn up my base clock I'm not only
increasing my CPU frequency but I'm also
increasing my RAM frequency so my dims
were raised as a result from a base of
21.3 3 times 100 which is 2133 to 21.3 3
times 110 which gave me a value of 20
346 so if you're wondering why that's
that that's why I know the RAM speeds
are gonna match regardless but pay
that's an incentive for going with a
newer platform you get ddr4 and you get
higher clock speeds naturally so that's
just part of the recipe in this case oh
and I should mention we are using
identical r9 380 graphics cards they are
clocked exactly the same ones that
sapphire and one's a gigabyte but
they're exactly the same they even use
the exact same PCB so that we've made
sure has remained constant in both
platforms
now that the platforms are out of the
way and you know what we're running in
both scenarios let's get straight into
the benchmarks which I know you've been
waiting for
so which one really is better the i3 60
100 or the FX 6300 first benchmark test
on the list is the
Cinebench benchmark and well the scores
were they were expected the I three two
cores and four threads is really
underperformed compared to the FX 6300
tech Sakura texture so the i3 scored a
435 and the FX scored a 453 now I know
this graph looks a little strange to you
it looks like the FX just blew the i3
out of the water but if you look at the
the bottom the x-axis there you'll see
that everything's been scaled to within
like 50 points or so so we also made an
adjusted score graph and this one kind
of puts things into perspective a little
better so you can see that really the i3
didn't do that much worse than the FX
processor I mean they were very
relatively close I think the i3 only
scored 18 points under the FX so for
only being a two core 4/3 processor it
did well to keep up with the FX 6300 so
if you're wondering how Cinebench works
whenever you click the Run button you'll
see a series of yellow squares start to
kind of form a spiral shape out from the
center and the number of yellow squares
is determined by how many threads your
CPU runs on so if your processor has
four threads you can only have four
yellow squares running at any time to
render that image so in the case of the
FX 6300 6 yellow squares could be
rendered at any given time whereas for
i3 even though it has hyper-threading it
still only has four threads so it was
only able to render four yellow squares
at a time so just a quick little
run-through of how Cinebench works but
anyway let's move on to Geekbench
Geekbench 3 is up next and these
outcomes
there were bit different so the i3
scored a single core score of 4098 this
is actually like the third or fourth I
can't remember I think it's the third
highest score of any CPU that's ever
been tested on Geekbench and that's just
because of the new architecture the new
skylake architecture that the 14
nanometer technology just kind of takes
the cake here you can see that the i3
did perform much better in single core a
single core now multi-core a lot of
things step all over the i3 but for
single core performance that that really
is not bad for how much you're paying
for the processor and of course they did
only score an 87 24 multi but that's
actually better than the FX is multi
score of 84 or 47 and you can also see
the FX
single core performance was not too
shabby at all it actually is about half
as efficient by these standards as the
i3 so yeah so even though the FX 6300
does have two more cores and hence two
more threads the i3 is still better as a
multi-core processor at least in this
test on I'm not trying to step on your
toes but in this particular test the i3
wins so let's move on from that I don't
want to keep you on that one for too
much longer the Adobe Premiere Pro test
so what I did was I took a one-minute
video file it was just just a movie clip
something I filmed and I trimmed it down
to just one minute I couldn't get it
exactly a woman if it was like one
minute and point oh three seconds or
something like that and I rendered that
video clip on both platforms I made sure
nothing else was running I made sure to
use the exact same preset for both and
these were the time so the i3 was able
to render the video file in one minute
and twenty two point seven three seconds
very impressive actually so for a ten
minute file it's only going to take
about fifteen minutes to render it's not
bad at all now remember here the the
shorter the bar the better so you want
to lower score in this case the FX and
it will only scored two minutes and
three seconds I shouldn't say only I
mean it scored more it scored two
minutes and three point zero one seconds
took a bit longer hold 40 seconds all
notes so I don't know what conclusions
you can make from that particularly but
what it tells me is that the i3 utilizes
its four threads more efficiently than
the FX processor does so that's
basically what I concluded from it but
of course you're free to make your
conclusions I'm just showing you the
graphs because this stuff stuff took a
while to come up with so let's move on
from that and let's get into the stuff
that I know you actually do care about
and that is the gaming performance how
well does each platform run the three
games that we've chosen
so the first up was dying light nice
zombie game kind of like GTA in a way I
mean it's it's an open-world so you can
kind of just do whatever you want unless
you want to do the missions and I made
sure that in both cases I ran to the
exact same places I just use fraps to
record the minimum average and highest
FPS rate and there you go now keep in
mind that these are both running
identical r9 380 s
and we noticed from the first batch of
results that dying light really is not a
a few intensive game like at all our
scores were very consistent so I guess
you could say that well it could mean
one of two things either the CPUs are
identical and the GPUs are identical or
the game just doesn't really care much
about the CPU performance and is solely
a graphics card performer and so you
will see in a second that it is only a
graphics card performer because things
change when we hop into GTA 5 now you
probably know by now just because of the
fact that I've said it probably a
hundred times on other videos that Grand
Theft Auto 5 is a very CPU intensive
game this is where we should start to
see one processor pull ahead of the
other one did but is it the one that you
expected the Intel i3 was the clear
winner in this case it achieved an
average FPS nearly ten frames above the
FX 6300 and was able to reach much
higher max frame rates as well we made
sure that vsync was off and we kept all
the settings exactly the same in both
cases
now gameplay with smooth for both don't
get me wrong I mean 40 FPS looks pretty
similar to 50 FPS but that's a 10 FPS
difference and that that means a lot to
a lot of people so that's what we wanted
to show you in this particular scenario
that you can edge out an extra 10 to 15
FPS in GTA 5 if you choose to forego the
FX 6300 and off for the newer until I
360 100 so last on our list is dota 2
and if you're not a GTA 5 or dying light
gamer
chances are you're probably a dota 2
gamer so that's why we chose this one
but wow
what's dota 2 super hungry for graphics
I mean it craved processing cores it was
heating up my GPU more than grand theft
auto 5 I did not expect it at all but it
just confirmed the fact that we made a
good decision to choosing builder 2 so
we max everything out we made sure that
we were running in full 1080p on both
platforms and it seems like dota 2
doesn't really rely on either the CPU or
the GP but prefers like a mix like a
co-op I don't know something like that
co-op but the Intel side of things did
edge out a slight lead in this case all
around from the average FPS to the max
to the minimum
there was about a 5 to 10 FPS
so I think in this case if you were a
dota 2 player or like a World of
Warcraft game or something like that
you're probably not going to have a
problem just forgoing the i3 and
choosing the FX 6300 so you're not going
to see it enough of an increase in my
opinion to spend the extra money on the
i3 so that's what I want you to get out
of this you've seen all of the results
and you've probably concluded the i3 is
a bit better in games and in just raw
CPU performance but does that justify
the extra price well I would say that
roughly six months ago it wouldn't have
justified the price because the ddr4 and
LGA 1151 platform was still super
expensive I mean to get ddr4 you have to
drop at least a hundred bucks on like an
eight gig kit now you can get ddr4 for
roughly the same price as ddr3 prices
for socket LGA 1151 have come down
significantly over the past year and
that's why I believe that choosing the
i3 6100 over the FX 6300 is a wise
choice look you can build on both
platforms for roughly the same price
this one that I built behind me cost
$650 in parts but the FX build that I
built before that one cost about the
same it was like six hundred twenty
dollars and I got the exact same
graphics card so it's not much more that
I can tell you I believe that i3 is the
way to go yeah you're gonna have less
cores but if those six cores and the FX
processors aren't going to run as
efficiently then there's no point in
even purchasing a six core processor
right so I don't know if you're an AMD
fanboy and I mean no disrespect by that
because I was at one point as well wait
till Sun comes out see how Zen treats
you but if you're very desperate to
build a gaming PC on a budget right now
I would go I three I think it's a
no-brainer thanks for watching everyone
