folks how you doing on this Sunday night
I made sure and check my calendar this
time it's definitely Sunday I totally
streamed last week on Saturday thinking
it was a Sunday that was really awkward
I've never done that before hmm
needless to say I learned my lesson
there certainly a fair sing and funny at
the same time but we are here what's
going on my dudes my dudettes I see Greg
no wait that's him what's up my dude I
see ped Pedro I see arrow
I see Nick I see Jay and Robert and
unofficial gypsy Thor Kieran what's
going on peeps I am here on the Sunday
night answer your questions so if you
have anything just off the top of your
head that you desperately want answered
or maybe my opinion on and go ahead and
shoot those questions my way that's what
I'm here for this is my my time to kind
of respond in a more personal way to the
questions that you still might have
based on maybe videos you've seen on the
channel in the past or something I've
said on Twitter or somewhere else and
maybe something like teased on Instagram
this is the time for for you guys to get
as many those questions as you can't
answer in the hour or so that we run
these after hours live streams so thank
you all for being here I know this is
kind of an awkward time especially if
you're in the monday-morning area like
red Europe Western Europe especially
it's like 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. where you
live so thank you guys especially for
watching I see a question here let's
start one off from Sebastian vocht
I don't know how to say that last name
but it's pretty cool last name Greg is
the fractal Celsius that's 24 good
enough for an 80 600 K at 5 gigahertz
and well that CPU I don't like a 1080 T
I
I'll talk my head I'm pretty sure I'm
pretty sure the Celsius isn't it that's
the mainstream ASA tech pump I want to
say if I'm not someone correct me I
haven't actually tested the ia IO but
I'm sure performs like most other 240
minutes out there and yeah you could hit
it depends on the chip right all
CP xoring we've been differently so you
can't just say yeah it'll get the 5
gigahertz 180 600 k because some chips
are gonna require more voltage some
aren't and the chips that require more
voltage that are more stubborn are gonna
run hotter as a result because you are
pumping more juice through the CPU if
you will so you know that questions a
little vague but I would say in general
you could get pretty close to 5
gigahertz I don't think that you should
you know just deem your chip of terrible
chip if it doesn't hit 5 gigahertz you
can hit 4.9 even I think that's good
enough especially for you know an i5
that cost around 200 bucks I think
that's really good ok I see one from
let's see scrolling up here Jeffie I
love the question it's good Jeff he
always has a good questions folks you
guys know Jeff the eight six nine six
why it does it take 15 minutes to make
Minute Rice and that's a good question
sorry five picture audio I can turn
myself down a little bit if I needed to
yeah it's actually that's very
thought-provoking
I appreciate the the inquisitive
thinking there this is why it's called
science studio right we're here to
answer these questions I apologize for
the weird noise in the background Pepsi
is doing some really stupid stuff she's
really starting to piss me off
Pepsi hey stop it stop it she just turns
around at me she meows and then she goes
back to what she's doing cats in general
Kiran do you think it would be worth
buying a 1080 after the newer Jenkins
have come out since it would be cheaper
I don't know Kiran it depends on what
the prices are she takes 1080 I wouldn't
pay more than maybe
it's tough I would I would put the 1080
about on the same price point that I
would put the 90 DTI when the 1070
rolled out remember because the 92 T I'm
the 1070 very comparable cards and now
with the the newer Nvidia drivers and
stuff I'm sure that 980ti is degraded
just a little bit in terms of
performance you are not going under that
monitor no ma'am but if you know we have
the new stuff out into the 1180 1170
whatever there happen to be called I
wouldn't pay more than maybe 300 to 350
bucks for a 1080 it's still gonna be an
epic card especially for that price but
again with the new stuff coming out we
don't know exactly how big these margins
are gonna be between generations of
cards if there were as big as they were
from Maxwell to Pascal you might just
want to buy the lower end you know next
in GPU so all the pens you know we're
gonna be testing all this stuff to stay
tuned but I can't give you exact figures
right now cuz I don't have the cards in
hand bazinga I think that $5.00 stupid
chat man dude what's going on again eh
what brand SAS internal car do you
recommend I don't know I don't chief see
if I can find one let's see I would say
Pepsi hey get out you guys just see that
okay I'm gonna link you actually know if
I can link in the chat I'm gonna put a
couple of the SSDs that I use in here
and I'm there I'm not gonna affiliate
link them or anything like that but I'll
just show you what I use I'm gonna put
this one put this one in there that's
what I do
did you guys see her knock something
down I don't know if you could actually
see in camera if she did anything but I
should have gotten coke good question
I use these 500 gig drives all the time
Exodus 860 Evo it's a little better than
the 850 but those are the that's that's
the SATA Drive I use all the time I have
used a few different brands of hard
drives I've used Toshiba drives I use
one Seagate drive it was an older drive
albeit still WD blues and it's been I
don't know it's been kind of a mediocre
experience with hard drives it's really
tough to just justify a hard drive when
you could buy storage pretty cheap now I
got 3d man and stuff is coming down in
price quite a bit especially since
launch but I would kind of stay with
Samsung quality stuff and then hard
drives I would stick with maybe WD that
would be my best bet I see the good
actually good questions here what do you
think about i-5 8400 verse r5 2600 for
gaming I have a video on that exact
question so I would defer you to that
video first I 580 400 would you let's
see to be honest some people have just
showed up to see the cat I'm sure dude
I'm
I'm really sure oh gosh but you know
Pepsi
she gives me company here right while we
rolled wildly I almost said Weesa well
Elise is gone you know I'm all alone
over here so I got a cat just because I
just need company
mark and puff pacify you space engine
and the answer is no what many people
have told me to actually use space
engine I guess it's a good benchmarking
tool if I'm hitting the table and that's
showing up on on the mic then I'll stop
doing that sorry let's see have you ever
tried the ducky one keyboard and if not
instead about reviewing it I've never
reviewed a ducky keyboard I know that
they're pretty I know but the first
place that I ever heard of the ducky
brand was from Luke from from - step -
little tech tips I can't speak tonight I
don't know what to go online guys and he
was like that was Wickham on his first
mechanical keyboards right I think was a
ducky and it looked pretty cool but it
just looked a little retro to me like I
don't really care much about like the
aesthetics of keyboard as long as it
clicks and feels good and has all the
functions I need I'm fun whatever you
don't have to be RGB or anything I said
all these colors - either white or like
yellow or purple by default I don't do
the rainbow stuff so that's that's just
my take on it when I go back up here
OSS Nick card I don't think I don't use
anything like that in my system
I'm very basic I just I've never touched
anything like that before
sorry I thought you were talking about
storage drives like just cereal test
drives I'm scrolling down to let's see
Jonathan can you overclock an i-5 6600 K
on an AC s be 150 I know well no you
can't any business grade board you're
not gonna be able overclocked then tell
blame Intel for that
let's see scrolling up mm how is the rx
550 in 2018
I mean its its lower end you're gonna
play some 1080 stuff in it for sure I
would say medium settings in most cases
depending on the title obviously witcher
3 is going to need to be turned down
quite a bit but you could play something
like rocket league no problem with a 550
so it's gonna depend on the game largely
but I would say no more than 1080p is
the max with that card for sure okay
that this is a good question here I like
this the the demon mitt I think it's how
you say your name in your opinion what
is the fair upcharge percentage that
system builders can charge and I
actually have first-hand experience with
this because I did for a while build pcs
sell them on Craigslist that was how I
cycled through inventory and was able to
review parts before I had established
connections with companies to send me
stuff a review so when I would sell a
computer on Craigslist let me just use
an example here excuse me I'm one of my
first systems that I sold on Craigslist
was like a five hundred dollar like core
i3 build and I sold that build I think I
sold it for 550 and if I didn't sell it
for I know I know I put it up there at
first for 600 and I think I took 554 to
540 just because people deal with 20s so
you just say to 20s on top of 500 so I
think that was what I charged and I kind
of felt I kind of realized how the
market was responding to the price
points especially back when I was doing
it it wasn't like a super hot thing
people weren't just building pcs in my
area to flip them and sell them so I
think that the surge now with PC
interests and stuff in the building
community which is great by the way I
think that that in and of itself kind of
like flooded the market and we have the
same thing right now with YouTube's you
tubers right the tech tubers there's so
many of them know so many smaller
channels and they're all trying to gain
traction I'm fine with that I'm not
gonna complain about it and so that's
something that I've kind of noticed when
it was easier when I was doing it back
then in my area because not many people
were competing so I would charge about
10% of charge of what I you know paid
for the system and I it's a flat 10% so
if the builds 500 bucks
then I'll charge you 50 bucks to put it
together chances are it's a cheaper bill
that's gonna be pretty simple
straightforward easy to cable manage you
know plug and play there you go but if
it's a $5,000 system it's likely gonna
be custom cooled right because of all
the extra hardware is gonna cost a lot
of money the blocks radiators the
fittings that the res is the pumps the
lighting fans all that good stuff you
know it really gets pricey but all that
takes a lot
time to assemble so I don't know if I
would charge 500 bucks but I probably
would charge something close to that
because of how much more time is
involved in getting these things into
this really expensive build making it
look like a $5,000 build should in my
opinion and I try to be as perfect as
possible when it comes to building these
things you guys saw my latest video with
the custom painting all that stuff if I
get a fingerprint in the paint if I get
a small speck that's like not supposed
to be there it bothers the heck out of
me often times I just redo the whole
thing so you know finding the right
builder is definitely important too but
I wouldn't pay any more than 10% of
charge for the system that that's just
my rule of thumb only because that's how
I usually deal with it as well I wanted
to see we had a Meg med hage thank you
for that $2 79 cent Canadian super chat
I wish you had asked a question with
that too but let's see what's 279
Canadians at like 40 cents us I'm just
I'm just kidding I'm just hating on the
Canadians up north a little bit your
currencies kind of an all currencies all
over the place too but I can never like
I can never keep up with like the
Canadian to USD conversion rates because
they say Nabeel is changing bazinga make
it to this what muck dude $20 super
check you're gonna pay for lunch for
like a week yeah I eat cheap don't judge
me
are you Robin and I have a decent dinner
but like I'll have ramen and like
chicken nuggets and just kind of get by
in the morning in the in the afternoon
and then at dinnertime I'll buy like
those cheap pork chops and Grill those
because it's also cheap I am a very
cheap person honestly bazinga
$20 super chat thank you my dude charity
challenge you Paul Kyle Jay Steve G and
Steve I will donate $2 per push-up that
each of you do within a 10 minute time
frame hold on I got it why is this
stupid shat I'm just gonna pop it out I
can't read the whole message overload
look juicy though this looks juicy all
right okay $2.00 per portion if you can
do a 10 minute time frame in st. Jude
Children's Hospital the name of the
winner
50 dollars to the winner posted end of
day $2 per push-up that you do in the
name of the winner $50 of the winner
posted and
yes that's pretty cool I think a
screenshot of that and see if this guy's
want to do it something interesting and
it's healthy and it's for a good cause I
like that
Nintendo Prime maybe we can match it to
Nintendo prime dot line 99 what's the
best budget CPU for 4k video rendering
budget I mean what's your budget that's
a subjective term I would say in the
realm of our five territory I know it
seems like I recommend that CPU a lot
but it's good bang for the buck from a
video editing perspective because it
does have multi-threading like
simultaneous multi-threading is a huge
step up from a premier standpoint and
that I say premiere because that's what
I'm most familiar with but you could get
by with it with an i5 CPU as well I'm
probably you might even get by a little
better because the i5 has the I GPU so
quick sync and stuff functions a bit
better because you have that second and
you know graphics processor if you will
so I would say budget don't go any don't
go into like r3 i3 territory stay in the
5s are higher you can go use as far back
as maybe Ivy Bridge or have or yeah I
would say high be Ivy Bridge is probably
smaller back as I would go as well would
be a safer bet and if you go back as far
as Haswell and try to stick with i7s I
wouldn't go to bulldozer piledriver
that's just my take on it real craft
what do you think about the 2018 13-inch
MacBook Pro to only feature the 8th gen
CPUs on the touch bar versions wait so I
didn't know this so the 8th gen CPU so
KB they are right so the the quad-core
ultra low power CPUs those are the ones
those ones are only available in the
touch bar 13-inch MacBook Pro so what
are in the non touch bar like mic mine
what would be in mind next gen 13 engine
on touch bar version is it just like a
recycled skylake or whatever that blows
I didn't know that off the read more
about that probe all I 780 709 cave or
sci-fi pitch I would pick the 8700 all
day because the 8700 even though you
can't overclock it still turbos pretty
high I think what 4.4.4 Giga it's
something I don't remember but it still
turbos decently and you're not gonna
need a you know super overkill cool
order to keep those temps in check
because it doesn't turbo that high but
the hyper 13 is gonna go a long way on
that 8700 ok here Nick
h-hey science to do what are your
thoughts on the Coolermaster silent Pro
hybrid a 1300 watt 80 plus fully gol
fully modular gold power supply I've
never heard of it but I will check it
out and let you know maybe I'm get into
someone for review although I don't I
have no use for 1300 watt power supply
is it like a perfectly silent PSU is
there no fan in it is that what the with
this special thing in silent Pro that's
what I would get from that interesting
um your gender says stay away from
cooler master PSU there are some there
are some pretty bad cool and master PSU
there are some pretty bad every kind of
manufacturer PSE or rebrand PSU out
there but there are good cooler master
PS use as well I know that Johnny guru
reviewed it was one of the cooler master
power supplies I can't remember the name
of it but he praised that thing because
of how well it was built the soldering
all that good stuff that he goes through
I invite you guys to watch or not watch
but to to look up Johnny guru power
supply reviews because I like I said my
recent power supply we've got all the
equipment to test that stuff but they do
so I recommend Johnny guru he's my first
go-to when it comes to power supply
reviews proper power supply reviews okay
I'm scrolling up I see William Humphreys
what's gonna we'll what's I'll charge
350 percent for fifty percent if you
want me to sign it what am I looking at
what a minute oh okay okay I see have
you ever used Linux Ubuntu what are your
thoughts on it from a perspective use
for someone use ah the only Linux I've
touched was uh in a Chromebook because I
had it was an old Chrome this is before
you could get access to it to the
Android Play Store Google Play Store I
had a chrome Pepsi uh
I had a Chromebook that I hated the the
the operating system a Chrome OS so I
did something to it I basically just
followed an instructional forum and I
flashed Linux on it and then I and then
I regretted that and I went back to
Chrome OS because like the Linux the I'm
so used to just
Windows and Mac OS like simplicity I
mean I know Windows isn't very simple
but compared to Linux and my eyes it's
simple I'm not like a hardcore software
coder I don't like having to run like
you know typing commands and stuff too
I don't run applications it's just a
different experience and I wasn't ready
to dive into that at the time so I kind
of regretted it that's about the only
experience I had with Linux not that I
wouldn't be up for trying it again
there's just I gotta find the time for
it okay scrolling down here
Adam Stevenson love your channel and
your content thank you I appreciate that
Adam can you possibly do a video about a
fresh windows 10 install what you would
recommend to do once in on setting it up
gaming setup that is thanks a lot I have
a recent video about was it a PC build
I'm pretty sure it was just a PC build
and in that build video it's a recent
video I talk about how to install
Windows 10 on to a newly built PC so
that you know and if you have to you
know partition drives and stuff for new
volumes for storing data and whatnot all
of that stuff is discussed in that video
I would link it to you but I want to get
to more questions if it's a you'll know
which video it is though on the channel
I keep having it put her on the ground
because she she'll bite stuff gets
annoying
oh let's see let's see scroll down Zeke
freak says streaming on a dual core good
luck with that
look I mean I guess you could here's
what you could probably do on an i3 you
could probably use you could use the
Nvidia encoder and so use envier and see
and then you could probably get away
with running a dual core for games I
mean it would take most of the load off
your CPU in the streaming department but
you're gonna be kind of choking your
graphics card just a little bit
depending on the card that you have so I
don't know but that would be a really
difficult thing to do maybe a video in
the future streaming on a dual core
system just to see how good or bad it is
okay I see some good stuff in here let
me get really quick through the superjet
so I can answer the other questions I
see in here
okay so here is one Brom on official
gypsy Thor thank you appreciate that
professional professional the smallest
nvme SSD you would use you mean like
storage wise I would say 240 I wouldn't
go in like 240 or 256 I wouldn't go to
120 because mm half that if not more is
gonna be dedicated to your operating
system at which point what else are you
gonna use that drive for I mean like I
like to have files that I use every day
like Adobe Premiere Pro I want to have
that all my store all my you know MDOT
to drive I don't want to have that on my
hard drive unless I have extra
solid-state drives and I'm not worried
about the reads or writes on those but
assuming it's a fast and via me I want
it to be as big as possible so I can put
as many programs on it as possible so
that the loads are near instant that's
weird this power supply just got really
loud it's just like full blast
it's a it's the EVGA g3 that's weird
it's pretty loud right now Taipei Taiwan
10 says Johnny guru works at Corsair now
right I did not know that that's a good
addition to the team that's for sure
I'm gonna scroll down to ICU Nate I'll
get tea in a second whole furball best
mouse and keyboard for FPS I know I did
I use Coolermaster mice and keyboards
just because it's just I'm not a very
complicated guy you know so I would
stick to whoever you're comfortable with
it's very difficult to switch gaming
mice once you've been used to one for a
long time especially the shape the
positions of the buttons and stuff
keyboards aren't as important for me but
the mouse makes a big difference in
first-person shooters I would weigh the
mouse choice more and just pick one that
feels good in the hand that's really
gonna matter more than anything I think
you know most sensors nowadays are
pretty good Nate gasps if you think for
that $5 super check my dude I just
upgraded to a risin 5 1600 and can't get
a stable overclock on it even 3.6
gigahertz is is it possible I'm being
limited by my 21 33 ddr4 your RAM
shouldn't limit your overclock to that
extent the 3.6 is pretty low you should
be able to hit 3.8 3.9 unless you just
have an absolute dud of a CPU check Shh
let's see I would say I would say check
load line calibration off the top of my
head that I'm I'm feeling maybe you have
like I don't know that stuff check check
LLC
check your V core obviously your V cord
for that should be around 1.3 if I'm not
mistaken don't quote me on that
double-check but it should be around
that voltage so just make sure that
you're not being limited by anything you
know reset your CMOS - I would just do
that straight up make sure you know how
many software conflicts or anything like
that that's that's really low frequency
though I wish I could help you more but
unless I'm there it's difficult to kind
of trouble troubleshoot and walk you
through it you pick Hennis as just
watched your paint your PC to tour from
2015 I must say your presentation and
confidence is greatly improved I
appreciate that it felt really cool it
was like nostalgia
going back you know to like the roots of
the channel custom painting stuff I had
a lot of fun painting I'm much better
now at painting that I was in those
videos and those videos I use Plasti Dip
mostly and Plasti Dip is she just
climbed on top of the monitor my my
monitor my ACS my house my gaming rig
right there she climbed on top of that
and just her claws just went all the way
down the front side of the screen that
poor thing just so she like cats are a
huge investment okay from a time
standpoint is there a difficulty manage
than that anyway yeah I appreciate you
watching and that was uh that was a long
time ago I was like two or three years
ago let's say hey scrolling down
thoughts on iBUYPOWER pcs I'm not really
a fan of pre-built free builds are just
kind of unless you do like the NZXT BLD
stuff like that looks pretty good a few
other manufacturers that use parts that
you know right are going in there that
you picked if you're basically just
paying for the build service itself but
pre-built tend to cut corners and they
do that to increase margins obviously
they put crap power supplies in there
most of the time the power supply is a
compromise so always try to check to see
what it is if it's not listed it's
probably a no-name brand that's not even
80 plus rated and that'll be the first
thing in your system ago I guarantee it
so be careful with that stuff everything
else you can pretty much see what they
put in there so the main reason why
though I don't go out there and just
recommend I buy power and cyber power
whoever else is because a lot of times
and the cheaper stuff they put crappy
power supplies in there and to me having
a terrible power supply in a system
that's worth at least six hundred bucks
is like putting terrible tires on a
really expensive car so anyway we're
gonna scroll down and now - I see you
will bazinga
thank you mrs. Inga again brother if I
don't super check my dude Greg does
Pepsi train the stuff she does Pepsi
train you from when Lisa comes home or
will you claim
I think I'll have to plead the fifth on
that one although I'm sure Lisa knows
what I want to say ah yeah look it's
tough guys it's really tough being apart
it's something that I don't wish on
anybody it's it's it's a really terrible
thing to have to go through at the same
time I mean it strengthens you we have
you know we have our fights just like
everybody and I think what makes it
worse is that when you're apart and you
have these conflicts it's it's it's more
difficult to resolve because you're not
there you know like for those who don't
know I'm Lisa is my wife and she lives
in Germany and we're working on being
able to be together but because she's a
German citizen and I'm a US citizen that
of course causes conflict these from a
political standpoint so we're trying to
get paperwork sorted out and stuff so
that she can be here with me permanently
but you know right now it's just we have
to call I mean it's all we can do we
just voice call we video call we do what
we can we play games together but that's
really the extent of it you know not
being together physically it's tough and
that's something that we've had to kind
of just endure you know work through but
uh you know yeah she she's a lot like me
believe it or not so chances are
whatever I feel about her she feels
about me too so at least I kind of know
where her mind is right because we think
a lot alike but that's just that's my
take on it does RAM speed really matter
Lee really comes down to the platform
that you're on Ram speeds gonna matter
more or less for architectures that
favor it when you talk about the
infinity fabric for AMD right that's why
Andy tends to be less ram frequency
timing tolerant because the Infinity
fabric is tied directly to RAM timings
Ram frequency and that's why I rise in
first gen right summit ridge was
difficult to get XMP even enabled on
stuff that was higher than 26 66
megahertz because the architecture
itself just wasn't compatible some of
those higher higher you know module
frequencies that's why he had a specific
modules specific kits designed for rise
and CPUs to actually get that kind of
coordination going right so in a
nutshell with second gen
Rison what we're seeing is that ability
to just enable XP profile to the box
like I've ran an old g.skill RGB kit
tried in Zeke it straight up 3000
megahertz this came out way before
second gen risin stuff did and X and P
straight out of the box awesome and it
does increase your frame rate it really
does against because it's tied to the
Infinity fabric so that that determines
the latency right between CCX
communications so cores within a
particular CCX cluster can communicate
super fast right because they're
essentially aren't as many channels
aren't as many roadblocks to go through
for those cores to communicate but then
when you have to CC X's right to CC X is
a four cores piece and we're getting in
a rising architecture here but in order
for those two clusters to communicate
they have to transmit data via the
Infinity fabric and the Infinity fabric
incurs a lot of latency so you have a
lot of lags and stalls when processes
require multi CC x you know processing
basically and that's why ram frequencies
are important right for Rison because if
those Ram frequencies are higher the
timings are lower then those
communications between CC X's are faster
and that means you have less latency
that means that you have less of a
bottleneck when it comes to processing
in general when it comes to gaming even
especially in CPU bottleneck situations
so there you go there's your spill of
rising architecture and how it effects
we have a video dedicated to this by the
way so I'm just throwing that out there
Alan Smith do I need IPS screens if I'm
running them in portrait mode it depends
on what you're doing again if you're
running them in portrait mode then I
would question what you want to do on it
if you're just having stuff displayed
just temporarily it's not gonna make a
big difference whether you go with T and
IPS vaa hva whatever it's all gonna be
pretty much the same if you're just
glancing at okay glancing at it
occasionally if you were going for IPS
for like you're dedicated like you know
main gaming rig then that's something to
consider
watch for ghosting look at response
times input lag try to get all those
things sorted out beforehand some IPS
older IPS panels typically and the
cheaper ones then have ghosting issues
but that's really the only downside of
going with IPs it's gonna be a bit more
expensive but you're paying for a better
quality image and we have an IPS video
dedicated to the actual architecture the
technology that is inter plane
switching and that will sort things out
free if you're looking at the waste that
liquid crystals turn when charged and
all that good stuff
it's all in that video anyway I see
another one bazinga my dude my dude you
just throwing cash at me my dude Greg
you need to learn arguing with a woman
is like reading a software license
agreement in the end you have to ignore
everything and click agree like oh gosh
that's a good one that's a good one I
wonder what Lisa would say to that
that's all I'm gonna say jeez I see you
can't say 75 I see in my late I wasn't
going lucky I go Greg I'm falling you
for almost one year now greetings from
Venezuela watching this on 240p keep up
the great work I appreciate that thank
you for the loyalty and support from
down south is Venezuela's north of the
Equator right so Ecuador is kind of
where that cuts through northern part of
Brazil
so you're just above the equator then
interesting let's see here ddr5 coming
anytime soon no I I don't follow stories
like that unless they're pertinent and
relevant you know in the current time
period so any room or anything like that
I kind of tend to shy away from I don't
like talking about stuff like that until
we have definitive facts
speaking of which of the gtx 1180 that's
what most people are calling it that
leaked PCB right it's just the board
there aren't components soldered to the
board it's just the board itself and I
was looking at that and I noticed you
know a few that other channels who were
covering this we're questioning whether
it was like gddr5 X or GDR six like you
could physically see the number of pins
for each module for each memory module
that wraps around the CP obviously it's
not HBM to because that would be in the
die of the GPU well next to the GPU I
should say but it's on the chip it's
literally on the chip you can see it off
to the sides of the die usually so we
know that it's not HBM to on the ten
eighty or whatever this card is it's an
eight plus six pin so it's probably a
higher tier car that's what people are
assuming it's a 1080 and then when you
when you look at those modules wrapped
around it you can see the number of pins
those modules have so 170 pins BGA right
because the the pins themselves they're
like they're kind of ball shake but they
solder those to the PCB and the number
of pins that are on the board tell you
what kind of module it is so gddr5 is a
170 BGA that means there's a hundred and
seventy pins underneath that memory
module that connect to the board so
there's 170 physical connections right
and then 190 BGA is I'm pretty sure it's
190 I'm trying to remember these off the
top of my head 190 BGA is gddr5 X so you
can you know again you can count these
right so you can look at a board if
there was nothing else on the board you
didn't know anything else about it but
you saw the number of memory module pins
then you could tell what kind of memory
was running it was GT or 5g do 5x well
gee DDR 6 has 180 BGA so slightly more
10 more than GDR 5 but 10 less than
gddr5 X and this is confirmed on microns
own website and Nvidia cards use for the
most part micron modules micron memory
modules and so 180 BGA on their website
straight up is G DDR 6 so that board
does have G DDR 6 pin outs on it so we
know it's a next-gen card it's not some
fake card unless somebody really thought
this through but that's the extent of
which I was kind of looking at
particular details on that board that's
about all I've gotten so yeah ball grid
away a ball grid array PD I said PGA I
screw that up PGA is the pin out that's
the the literal pin grids that you see
unlike the bottoms of rise in CP SIMD
CVS on the most part of our PGA and then
yeah BJ's ball grid Gryphon hey Greg
your videos are amazing but I have one
question would you recommend second gen
rise no for Intel considering the newer
i7 are going to ditch hyper threading I
don't know where you read that but I
don't believe the newer i7 Tsar gonna
ditch hyper threading I think that's a
little far I mean if that's true then
that's disappointing but I'm sure the
that might be the way a pump in the i9 I
guess but I've always favored I like
both CPUs
but second-gen risings gonna probably be
the better value it usually is it was
last time right with summit ridge so I
imagine that'll be the same way this
time around well it's the difference
between a 970 Evo SSD and a Samsung 500
gig well you have 970 Eve of a 500 GB
drives 960 Evo 500 gig drives 950 Evo if
I mean usually the difference is gonna
be your read and write speeds so check
the reads and writes usually for an SSD
somewhere around 500 read 500 right and
if you go to something like a a 2 Lane
m2 is gonna be some around a thousand
reads 800 writes around there and then
you step up to the 4 Lane m dot twos and
vmin do's and then you're gonna get up
to 3,000 or so reads and 2,000 to 3,000
writes in most cases so it's all about
speed so that's why these different
drives exist so that's what you should
really pay attention to that and the
price really all that matter in my book
J's random video is can we know what the
next video is going to be about excuse
me I did something to do with Windows 10
I will tell you that much about it I'm
still doing testing currently but it'll
have something to do with a setting in
Windows 10 and many people are
questioning ok yeah I'm gonna scroll
down let's see yeah let's see here good
stuff good stuff question good stuff ok
we have okay Jonathan Paniagua
asks off the top of your head you know a
motherboard compatible with an i-5 6600
and i7 seventy seven hundred or 8700 so
6600 so 6000 series is gonna be z170
that would be your chipset for an
unlocked SKU and then Z 274 7700 Z 370
for your 8700 that's again the Z chipset
so just keep that in mind there are more
than just Z series chips out there
chipsets I should say from other boards
each of those CPUs has a different chip
set of compatibility you can put KB leak
boards you know you can pair Z to 70
with a 6600 or 70 6700 K I'm confusing
myself
dang it but you guys know what I'm
trying to say
anyway mm-hmm okay scrolling down here
Alan think without $10 chat mon Dieu
g'day watching from Australia love your
work keep it up also are we gonna see
more videos on your Audi Alan I hate to
disappoint you but I sold my Audi I
traded it in I upgraded to an Infiniti
q60 red sport so I ditched all-wheel
drive in this model the q6 t I have
rear-wheel drive but I got 400 ponies
and I have about 350 pound feet of
torque that's stock but I love the
technology in the car I love how it
handles the love how it looks and I got
a 100 K powertrain 10 year warranty so
because it was certified pre-owned so
that's my baby for the time being and I
love her
I missed the all-wheel drive I
definitely do the look the s5 was
planted like that thing was planted and
it sounded great that exhaust on it was
a v8 but this is a v6 twin turbo and
it's more tunable so I think in the
future you know running some mods apart
from just an exhaust and an intake
system you know lower down pipes maybe
jb4 maybe even a fresh ECU tech tune
something along those lines all that
would eventually void my warranty but
when I get to the point where I'm just
like I don't care about the warranty you
know I trust the car then maybe sorry
about that
then maybe I'll consider doing a bit
more and I'll be sure to cover all that
a channel I know you guys some of you
like the car stuff okay
scrolling damn here scrolling down Tech
friends at fun factors you guys know the
science study or Greg used to be a gym
freak neither did I yeah used to be I
talked about a little bit in my last
livestream let's see here
we have a two dollar super chat from
Krypton Acadie what's going on
Kryptonian we have mod status transfer
request to tech crimson yes sir I got
you good here would go add mod there you
go Tech crimson this that's Krypton
Acadie who's already in mod so I just
transferred the status their gear
seekers I've dialed a super chat what is
5l that's Australian yeah that's right
this is for the cat don't spend this on
yourself you hear that Pepsi Pepsi girl
where'd you go oh she's back there
here let me see if you guys can see her
there she is
hey Pepsi they want to see you baby girl
they want to see you huh see down it's
really dark anyway he just chills I feel
I feel bad for sometimes I'll sometimes
I'll work for oh gosh out like we're
talking maybe 12 14 hours a day like
I'll work from noon to 3:00 a.m. and
that poor cat just has to just lay there
you know if she's just sitting there
watching me do stuff I'm not giving her
any attention you know everything I'll
take a break and play with her for a
little bit but she just gets all like
excited and bites the crap out of me and
it hurts you know like I can't keep
doing that stuff so uh yeah that's my
that's my experience with cats Joe
Clancy how bottleneck am i with a 6-ski
1060 and a 4.4 gigahertz FX 6300 that
6300 gonna be your bottleneck for sure
in 90% of situations I would say I
your next upgrade would be I would say
your CPU and your motherboard and your
RAM because you're an indie dr for that
platform is ddr3 based so I would say
are five maybe even r7 you want to step
it up a little bit more but that's about
where you're gonna be I think if you
already had a 1066 gig you know what's
up you know what's next to upgrade I
think that platform has got to go excuse
me let's see here scrolling down so do I
need to have a 970 Evo which is m dot
two or a samsung 500 gig SSD which is
best or can I do with clay you got to
look at the reads and write speeds the
reads and write speeds of that m dot -
I'm pretty sure just off top my head
they're gonna be higher than that 500
gig SSD okay yeah I mean solid state
storage right the SSDs in general are
drives that don't require spinning
components right they're not discs they
don't write on disks they write in chips
and memory chips so it you know calling
them calling one an SSD and calling one
not an SSD or it's kind of it's not
correct technically you have SATA SSDs
and then you have m dot two pcie-based
SSD
and that's kind of that's the big
difference there you'll see the speed
jumps but look at the reads and write
speeds look at the prices you'll see
that the ones that are much faster
drives are gonna cost a lot more that's
the reason for it let's see
I'm nervous about okay ratchet his name
is ratchet ho I'm not even I'm not
saying I'm nervous about overclocking
but I understand the benefits it's my
very first build should I look into it
more high seven seventy seven hundred
okay I mean yeah you gotta know you got
an unlock skew I would definitely try I
mean you can just barely bump volt to
somebody you leave voltage and auto but
when you do that sometimes the BIOS will
throw too much voltage at CPU more than
you need so you got to fine tune it a
little bit don't be afraid of blue
screens of death just clear CMOS start
from scratch you'll be okay you'll get
used to it
we have overclocking guides on this
channel other channels have them as well
that I condone watching and you'll get
the feel for it very quick Gregory says
you build all these gaming PC's but do
you game yes I do a game on my personal
rig right here tomorrow right
I game while I was playing pub G just
this afternoon actually a good question
though in 2018 should I choose an m to
drive or a two and a half inch SSD look
I've been using you know SATA drives for
a long time and they're plenty fine in
90% of cases you know once you go up to
a PCI based and about to drive its
excuse me it's faster but I just don't
see no I don't think the prices have
matched up yet for me to justify buying
one of those over two and a half inch
drive that you could get for much
cheaper in most cases every now and then
you find a cheap in bout to drive and
they're gonna be a little faster even if
they're two-lane PCIe whatever but it's
you know you got to find the right deal
and it's easier to find cheap two and a
half inch drives in most cases I and I
think they're plenty fine don't go to a
hard drive if you if you're building a
new PC you try your best to not use a
hard drive as your your primary drive
where your operating system is stored
you can have it as a secondary drive
with Steam games and all that stuff
perfectly fine I do that but don't load
your operating system on your hard drive
that is something that once you get used
to an SSD speeds it's so difficult going
back to a hard drive it
really is okay I missed missed a couple
super chats here we got one from let's
see one from Jace McKinstry
what's going on Jace $10 super check my
do you think you is excuse me a motifs
making updates to the store and I
software or since emoto's via would you
recommend it to people on a budget since
be 450 boards are out now I'm actually
in the process I hate to do this because
you threw money I me but I don't want to
spoil anything yet I'm in the process of
putting together a store mama it's store
in my video all about a Mistura my how
to use it and the true benefits of it I
think it's actually pretty good
for what it is and this is something I
didn't even know about until I am he
asked me to you know put something
together review it they'll send me stuff
and they sent me an SSD and they sent me
a hard drive and then they sent me a
2600 I think and they're like here have
fun with it and I haven't finished the
video yet because other things have come
up but I want to get back to that video
so that right there you're super chat
boom I'm gonna do that video and I'm
gonna try to get it done this week so
thanks for bringing it up again that's a
good question and yeah I think storm is
viable for for many people on that
platform so stay tuned what car con Ted
nella super chat Monday when hey man I
love the contact you pump out I have a
4690k right now gets a good i five
unlocks q should I upgrade to the 4790k
or build an entirely new system this is
just strictly for gaming strictly for
gaming I think you're good enough for
the I mean if you're asking whether or
not you should upgrade to a 4790k or not
I say stick with a 4690k if you're
asking if you should switch from the
4690k to a totally new system it's gonna
depend on from Haswell to coffee-like
you're gonna see upwards of 15 ish
percent frame rate increases and
cpu-bound titles that's just I'm just
raw doggin off the top of my head here
but in a nutshell that's roughly what
you're gonna see if you think that's
just a file for getting a whole new
platform ever gonna need a ddr4 right
cuz you're on ddr3 platform right now
that's gonna be tough to push out but
you could if you feel like justifying it
in your head right from a price
perspective
there's anything wrong with upgrading
but you might want to wait one more gen
wait one more generation one stick with
Intel I would wait just a few more
months until you get the new stuff out
because that will be an even more
substantial upgrade I think especially
with what we might see from Intel with
the AI nines so let's see okay
SC ug skug asks what does a 1080i need a
750 watt or 850 watt you could get by
with a 1080i you can get by with a 650
watt I mean or 600 watt even I've run I
run a 1080i on a 600 watt power supply
and I say the six and r1 power supply
and it was an eye it was an i5 70 I
think it was an i5 7600 2k I want to say
and I'm pretty sure was pulling close to
like 400 450 from the wall though I
still had plenty of headroom I'm pretty
sure it was slightly past my peak
efficiency curve the the you know the
peak efficiency point on that efficiency
curve but nonetheless six hundred power
supply should do it unless you're like
if you're hyper overclocking your tendon
TTI you might get close to that boundary
but in most cases six or seven hundred
watts is a sweet spot anything higher
than that just gravy you're just future
proofing yourself although most
advancements usually a pretty power
conservative anyway when we seen look at
the difference between the 92 TI power
draw right for its performance value
compared to the 1070 which was a
comparable card at the time which is
improved slightly since we've had a
video updates roll out for over a year
but it was a much more efficient card it
required less power had a lower TDP and
we got you know comparable performance
so you can look at it for that
perspective and say well I'm still
probably gonna be a future-proof but it
I don't think it hurts going for an 850
watt power supply if you just want to
stay comfortably within your curve your
power supply will just effortlessly push
out that that power stay very quiet and
at the same time you know going any
higher than that going like thousand
watt plus for a single GPU CPU setup
unless you're going with like an i-9 you
know 79 80 XE to me makes no sense so
that's where I would keep it in that in
that ballpark yeah okay scrolling up I'm
gonna get some of the other good
questions you guys have in
see ah let's see yeah any solid David H
as any doll any solid really any solid
$50 coolers for an overclocked 8700 k or
should I just grab an actua good
question um 50 bucks yeah yeah I would
say you could go with something I know
that a crier Rick has a couple good
coolers in that price range you can go
with a quad Lumi I use a quad Lumi with
my 8700 K you could go with try anything
about that $50 cool the cooler master
has a couple $50 coolers the new hyper
212 evo or 212 whatever it is they have
a newer cooler that's kind of pretty
high GDP as well I would say I would say
around 150 to 200 watt TDP would be a
very comfortable limit for free or
cooler assuming here come with an air
cooler so yeah I would say cryo rig
cooler master in that area and your
tower is not gonna be too thick right
you go with this really expensive stuff
that stuff that's a hundred dollars plus
those are blogs for this especially in
the dark Bass Pro are not dark base for
the dark rock Pro for an aqua and HD 15
those those coolers are really beefy and
that's why they're expensive more raw
materials the fans they architected it's
a construction of the fans so stuff to
consider yeah but I think fifty fifty
dollars is a good good price point for
that maybe just a little bit more
scrolling up here your crowing gaming
resolution silver my current gaming
resolution is 1440p at 165 Hertz okay
let's see fortnight royale science
student can you give me tips on how to
grow my fortnight channel oh we did I
don't really know I'm not familiar with
gaming channels I don't know how
algorithms work for gaming channels on
YouTube I'm not the best person to ask
that question my friend I'm sorry I
don't to give you a wrong and obviously
keep doing what you're doing and any
time you doubt yourself you got to keep
going
many times I doubted this channel my
ability to keep this channel at a good
pace you just got a truck through it you
know everyone's gonna have difficulties
growing something that you know it just
requires organic growth so it'd be
different do something different now use
catchy titles that are
clickbait because your audience won't
forgive me for that that you know be
entertaining be a good host and you'll
probably grow I would say it's a fair
assumption okay let's see cons a 755
what's a better bang for the buck for a
thousand dollar bill to rise in her
Intel I would say for that kind of price
I would say Rison if you wanted to spend
upwards of 1,500 bucks
I mean bang for the buck Verizon's
always gonna be your value option but if
you want a $1,500 beast gaming PC I
would say 8700 K all day if you wanted a
$1,500 beast streaming pc i would say
you risin 2,700 2,700 x all day i'm
streaming on the 2700 x what does that
tell you
so that's how i that's that's how i
differentiated - is that question comes
up almost every live stream by the way
let's see here scroll down to some of
the good stuff I missed a couple of
Super chats okay there we are
tell me all those questions are pretty
good okay
here's one this is a pretty good move
I'm gonna get this to pretend a second I
see you by the way
Gabe Williams asks what's your favorite
GPU board partner I've worked I've
worked closer with EVGA I think than any
of the others
I like gigabyte cards too but I think
gigabyte can get really cheap with their
cards I mean they have really good cards
and they have really cheap cards so they
have a wider spectrum almost every VGA
card I've ever tested is of good quality
and stays very quiet
Asus has great cards Asus cards also
kind of vary on the spectrum though they
have very cheap cards and they have
pretty expensive cards EVGA for that
mean ya know EVGA has cheap cards too
but I've had better experience with
cheaper EVGA cards and I have any of the
others MSI is kind of on the same boat
most MSI cards are gonna be pretty good
no matter what but obviously if you go
with the higher end stuff then I think
that of like just from an aesthetic
standpoint the best-looking card in my
opinion is probably got to go to a soos
ii would probably I would say seconds
probably a mess
I third is EVGA fourth is a gigabyte
that's where that's the order I would
put them in the big four in my eyes good
question
Louise Fonseca I think I said that right
10 that was super chat thank you man
dude how big of an upgrade you expected
the i7 9700 K I have a 77 hurricane and
wanting to do both gaming and streaming
on the same bill don't want to use Rison
well then obviously that i7 is gonna be
your best bet I don't know too much
about specs though I haven't actually
looked I know about the the i9 right
everyone's calling at the I&amp;amp;I and I
guess that's what it's gonna be called
but III not Cecchini in on the
performance numbers I don't have those
CPUs test even if I did have them to
test I probably couldn't tell you so I'm
breaking some sort of in da and then
Intel or whoever sends me chips would
never send them to me anymore
but I actually don't even have an Intel
contact for receiving early samples so
like the ions right the 7970 980 XD i
got that's from motherboard vendors
they're just engineering samples they're
not from Intel you know or whoever
distributes Intel stuff so I don't have
that connection
I do have an AMD side connection so I
get AMD stuff from an AMD networking
company whatever you want to call a
marketing company but I don't have that
for Intel so even if those CPS did come
out I probably wouldn't be one of the
first to get those samples because I
don't have contacts with whoever
distributes them so that's just that's
just how the industry works sometimes
you either have connections or you don't
just gotta deal with it
TJ has venom cannon static electricity
really damage PC parts yeah it can J is
a video on this it's got to be a serious
shock though I mean obviously enough
electricity here to fry something you'll
fry a cap or a resistor or something
especially when it's not rated for the
amount of power that you're running
through that component but I would say
on your most circumstances if you just
shock a board accidentally by maybe
quickly grab on your feet across carpet
it's not gonna kill the component if it
does at least you know what caused it
and you can tell the manufacturer that
of course we take apart a card though or
anything else you're gonna probably
forward your warranty so keep that in
mind let's see here I'm gonna scroll
down to
but Baba that's weird I don't have a I
don't have admin privileges on my own
chat oh I see Krypton I Grady Robledo
okay do we have Nuria science to do I
have have you had any issues
overclocking SLI cards not really no I
don't usually overclock graphics cards
much higher than the stock or clocks the
cards are pretty smart the software is
pretty smart intuitive it knows when you
have more power disposal when your
temperatures are in check it would give
it a little more boost and then when it
gets too hot it'll boost it down a
little bit it's kind of like its own
like self throttling system but it
always tries to maximize performance I
never really see the need to overclock
much higher than even my custom cooled
cards I don't overclock rapid cards I
ever collect my CPU but not my graphics
cards I just it's not something that I
feel like going through the hassle of
doing for that marginal fps increase
only so that the cards in the entire
loop run slightly hotter zombies civvies
that is a dumb question you know the
answer that question zombies it is pub G
all the way I freaking hate for night I
hate for night so much let's see mst3k
thank you for the fabulous super chat my
dude I ordered my n throat pro-am and
Coolermaster vertical wood GPU kit today
any tips on on install of that I have a
video mst3k on literally how to install
the cooler master kit so just type it in
type in vertical GPU mount my video is
one of the top on that list and it'll
show you how to install the cooler
master bracket but I remember you asking
a question in the last electrum about
the same thing so it's good to know that
you went and bought that case the anthem
is a good case I have built in that case
before let's see
silver asked g-sync if not is it worth
it a g-sync is it's only worth it under
a few circumstances when you're playing
at lower fps it matters more but if
you're gonna buy like a one like this is
a 165 Hertz g-sync display over here to
my right and if i have g sync off vs on
i can't really tell the difference at
higher frame rates 100 to 120 fps a
little bit of a difference but if I'm
almost maxing out my frame rate I can't
really tell
the difference so it really matters
around like 60fps to ATF sometimes as
low as 40 fps really depends on the
monitor itself but in the resolution
obviously but I would say in that frame
rate range is where juicing is really
gonna count so it's kind of funny
because like g-sync is usually in the
more expensive higher refresh rate
monitors and most people who buy those
have systems that can put out that many
frames at which point juicing becomes
obsolete anyway free sing for that
matter is the same way even though free
sync doesn't have as much of a tack song
it's not as expensive in most cases of
juicing monitor so you know Jeffy athlet
pepsi answer a question why is there no
Mouse flavored cat food hey that's a
good question
Pepsi girl she's pouch she's totally
like gone she's so tired
MRX kick says pub G Mobile's where it's
at I yeah pub G Mobile's pretty fun it's
it's a little too easy i think i think
people suck in that game and then like
the bots they're supposedly the bots
that they put in it
are also pretty trash so it's like a
false feeling of satisfaction and like
success I don't know it's just my take
on it let's see sorry silver I didn't
see your super check for that but yeah I
guess I answered your question yeah I'm
using G sync on my personal rig but
again the differences between it on and
off at my framerate or negligible I
would say and I've actually done like
tests with it on and off I can't really
tell the difference
Jhansi for not super chat my dude do you
think fantex did enough to make the new
end though if or then you evolved X one
of the best ventilated cases in 2018 not
sure if it's gonna be one of the best
they claimed three times additionally
air flow if I recall correctly from
Computex and they did definitely you
know they they recessed the case from
that front panel quite a bit more than
they did in the previous of all case
they widened the vents more they added
ventilation grooves up top extra ones so
there's more breathing room up top as
well for exhauster intake set up but
we're gonna have to just test it we're
going to see exactly you know we exactly
what the difference is especially with
the panel on versus off dust filter on
vers off and compare that to the
original evolve just to see
if it really is three times the airflow
right now it's gonna be difficult to
test the airflow without like a an
actual you know measurement tool for
that but I would say it I'm gonna take
them at their word for it until I get
the case because I have nothing else to
go off on at this point good question
though
sizzle at science studio what happens
when you put thermal paste on the pinned
side of the processor well if your
thermal paste is conductive and you're
gonna have a really bad time if your
thermal paste is not conductive then
you're still gonna have a really bad
time but not from a like you're not
gonna fry components more or less you're
probably just gonna end up having a
clean out socket which can be also a
real pain but I think it's more
dangerous if you have conductive stuff
so if you put like you know conduct a
knot in in a socket then I think you're
gonna have more of a problem than if you
put mx4 or something that claims to be
non conductive that's a good question
though I guess Adriana
Borges what is the meaning of life what
is the meaning of life what is the
meaning of life I don't know
jazz Garcia is a PC riser cable decent
for an rx 580 I think you asked the
question I mean I think you asked a
question wrong I it a riser cables gonna
vary from manufacturer to manufacturer
in terms of like any performance
degradation you see from that I can't
tell you you didn't ask me what PCI
riser cable you're referring to many
different kinds there are some really
trashy riser cables out there avoid
those at all costs go with something
from coolermaster or thermal take me
only have some good ones as well those
I've really never had problems with
except for for one from thermal take
that was it yeah so those are the big
three I would recommend let's see roast
pig is crypto mining still profitable
I don't Krypton mind I've never Krypton
mine I think it's a cesspool of
unregulated garbage I'll say that every
live stream if I have to I've never
touched script of money and I don't
think that it would be right for me to
utilize cards I get for free to mine
with I just
that's I don't know not worth my time
let's see I can't say your name
Jah Jah Pedro BT keto title I don't know
anything any thoughts over cooling
solutions making direct contact with CPU
I mean obviously either more efficient
right because the IHS and the dai have
to be connected via some sort of thermal
interface usually it's just the thermal
compound and that's pretty similar to
what you'd put on top of the IHS to
merge to your cooler so you think of it
like a sandwich right you got your die
that's what's where the heats coming
from right that's your heat source then
you have a thin layer of crap from Intel
mostly and then you have a piece of
metal and then you have another thin
layer of okay stuff and then you smush
your cooler on top of that so you have
two weak points there but if you do
direct contact via from from the die
itself to a cooler then you have less of
that heat loss due to the inefficiencies
involving the thermal compound earth at
the you know thermal interface so yeah
obviously the less areas for a heat
bottleneck the better and that's why
direct die solutions are better but
they're also kind of dangerous because
you could potentially damage your dive
if you if you mount something
incorrectly that's why it's not
mainstream I expect it's easier to mount
onto a metal plate on top of the die and
I'm sure that's why they all do it or at
least part of the reason why they do it
let's see dragos Drag Nia how much
should I invest into cooling and 8700 K
to get 5.1 gigahertz ooh interesting I
would say around it depends on the CPU
obviously I can't tell you exactly how
much you're gonna need to throw into
your cooler because your CPU could be a
really trashy CPU and require a ton more
voltage than another 8700 K that's much
better Bend we have a video on bidding
it's somewhere on the channel you can
just type in bidding CPU science to do
it'll come up we talked about it but
there are variances from CP to CP
because not all chips come from the same
wafer all wafers have certain
of imperfections some of those chips
don't even have viable cores and those
chips are recycled down to lower and
chips like the i-5 the lineup in the i3
lineup because not all the chips are you
know some of them are compromised
basically as what I'm trying to say AMD
does the same thing with there are 7 sr
5s and our threes so you can't really I
can't just put a number or a cooler
value on that CP because I don't know
how effective the overclock is going to
be on that how stubborn it's gonna be
from a voltage perspective I would say
in most cases if you want that high of
an overclock at least a hundred bucks I
would get a really chunky air cooler
dark Rock Pro in HD 15 status and then
if you don't want to go with air cooling
then I would say at least a 240 ml a IO
but try not to go with one of the weaker
pumps try to go with something a bit
stronger of course there H 150 I would
be a better solution for something like
that just off the top of my head just
yeah ok here let's see it is it's been
an hour we're gonna wrap things up soon
folks but I appreciate all of you watch
me get a little over 2,000 people
watching right now you guys on dope ah
let's see here
if you guys let's see what ok ok ok I
see some good ones should I get an a
data SSD from Cornell I did it makes
great SSDs I've used a today SSDs quite
a bit so I do recommend them I've used a
did a 10.2 nvme SSDs as well they're
very fast very reliable they don't get
too hot they use great memory chips
memory modules so yeah I would say agen
is a good brand a data samsung I would
say even Toshiba you know I would I
wouldn't recommend Toshiba over a
Samsung or over a data but I would
usually go with those two first that's
just my preference I've had the least
amount of issues with them let's see
shade array it says needed in turn I
would totally be down for an turn if you
are totally down for not being paid cuz
I don't have enough money to pay you but
I would totally show you the ropes if
you were really into that let's see ah
Rab ik Seoul says these sessions are
very enlightening I appreciate that I'm
glad that these uh these help yeah I
know this is probably recycled news for
a lot of people like this is a reason
don't do like the news live streams
because I feel like everybody recycle is
the same crap every week and it's hard
to differentiate yourself and that's why
I like doing just the ask me anything
live streams because you guys get a
personal touch right you get me directly
responding the questions that you ask
you get my feedback my experience and
that's something that it's difficult to
get in just everyday videos on the
channel just because I can't talk to
2,000 people at the same time so but
thank you for your for all these
questions you guys have been asking
you're giving me plenty of content
plenty stuff to talk about it's not an
awkward you know like I've seen live
streams where it's very awkward and like
nobody talks and and like even the host
he's like not - he's like reading
something it takes them like 30 seconds
to read it's like dude talk like you're
the only guy at camera say something you
know it's like even when you're reading
something you've got to still engage
with your audience somehow it's
difficult for a lot of people to do I
understand that but you know if you're
you know good seeing up the livestream
and risk something going wrong you
should at least have the you know the
drive to want to encapsulate your
audience and keep them engaged to some
extent right so they're not staring at a
blank screen with you reading something
that they can't read themselves anyway
done with that spiel arrows 777 would
you do any monster Audi I know that you
have already done exhaust would you
consider a wrapper bodykit arrow I sold
I talked about this earlier live stream
I sold my s5 I traded it in for an
Infiniti q60 red sport so I traded up in
the power department I got a better
looking car I got a better warranty on
the car better gas mileage
it's just rear-wheel drive instead of
all-wheel drive so I lost all-wheel
drive I lost the planted Quattro feel
but it's okay this the rear-wheel drive
its sporty I have terrible tires on this
car that I got replace them with like
Michelin pilots or something because the
tires on there I don't even know the
name like they're just off-brand tires
I'm pretty sure Infiniti put them on
there because the I think it was a lease
before I bought it it's it's only got
10k miles but I'm pretty sure was the
lease and they replaced the tires when
it was sold or returned to the
dealership and then just put like the
cheapest tires I could on their
obviously because why would you put the
best you know you're gonna charge more
for it keep the price down write more
bids and I think that's what they did I
can't get grip for crap especially like
in first gear it's impossible
second year even I spend tires so
Michelin pilots I think are coming
but then I'm debating whether I should
go because I have a staggered set up
right so I think I have 265 s in the
rear and I have two 45s up front then
for those who don't know what that means
it's a the width of your tire basically
and the rear tire is I don't think the
rear tires are wide enough for one I
think I'm gonna step with like 285 spur
then I gotta get new rims which is also
gonna cost more money
I like the rims on my car but I'll pry
stuff up the 20-inch rims and then up
front I think 255 so maybe 255 285 or
maybe as high as 295 and if I go
Michelin pilots it's just gonna be
instant grip and there'll be though
they're all season tires even though
they're sport all season tires a lot of
good reviews on the michelin pilots the
deranged game I think with a $5 canadian
mon dieu looking to build a gaming pc
soon should I go with a 10 series GP or
wait for 11 series to launch it's up to
you I really can't answer that question
for you
every time someone asked his questions
I'm just like well I'm not you I don't
know what you want how badly you want it
but if I was you and I was just you know
casually looking I would casually
continue to look until we hear about
something some sort of release date for
the eleventh series launch because while
10 series cards have definitely come
down considerably in price unless you
found them for a really good deal that
you think you could resell and get most
your money back from I would wait you
know unless you knew the system right
now I would wait exactly JP time it's
it's almost like you know when people
ask this question I'm not trying to
knock on you drantch gamer I'm just when
people asked this question I almost feel
like just saying you know like I if you
want to wait now then what's stopping
you from waiting a year from now like
when's your you have to have a deadline
in your head when you want to have
something when I was going to buy my car
I didn't know when I was gonna do it
right I'm using this because I was just
talking about the q60 but I didn't know
what I was gonna do it right eventually
you get tired of looking your slate
alright screw it you know I'm just gonna
go out and do it and you just gonna tell
yourself you're gonna do it and you go
out and do it and you don't second-guess
yourself you have a number in your head
a price that you want to pay and you
stick to your guns and if the price that
you want to pay doesn't line up with
what the dealer's willing to sell the
car for then you move on that's the sign
that you need to wait but if you get
what you want for it then there's your
cue there's your open door whatever sign
that you're looking for that you should
get it I know it's different with PC
parts because you can't really
haggle with PC parts but you know if
you're scrolling and you're saying okay
if I find a GTX 1084 400 bucks I'm gonna
buy it right away
commit commit that in your head right
commit to yourself that you're gonna buy
a card that you see for that price
whenever you see one and if you don't
see one for that price by the time 11:00
series come out then look you waited but
if you didn't wait and you saw a car
that cheap and it was a one-time sale
and you bought it you're gonna be happy
with yourself anyway because you've got
a really good deal right so you kind of
got to just make ultimatums and you've
got to stick to your guns and just buy
something when you see it on sale oh you
have a number in your head yes Joe says
Greg how I should be with marriage like
you get tired of looking and just go out
and do it Oh Joe that is the comment of
night I love that that was that was a
good twist I don't recommend you just go
out and do it though it this is a big
commitment it's not like buying a car
you can't just go around and sell it I
mean you could return it you could get a
divorce but I don't you know if you're
gonna marry with the intent of getting a
divorce if you don't like the marriage
then you shouldn't get married in the
first place but the way I see it it's a
it's a huge commitment it's a lifelong
commitment that's what marriage is
supposed to be right you know the vows
that you exchange with each other it's
supposed to be lifelong so when you made
that kind of a minute I would you know
Joe I would I would take that a little
more serious biblical knives doesn't
matter what direction you face your CPU
cooler try to face it upfront if you
have intake fans they're gonna be less
restricted if you face it from down
below or it's pulling up air you're
gonna pull up warm air from your
graphics card it's less ideal you're
gonna be pulling warmer air so the t
delta is slightly different it's
slightly lower and when you have a lower
T to T Delta then your conduction is
gonna be young you'll be conducting heat
at a lower rate right because the T
Delta is lower so that's like just like
elementary thermodynamics but you know
what I mean so if an object is already
pretty hot and you put it up against
something that's producing heat that's
generating heat then it's not gonna
conduct this as much energy as a colder
unit would so being able to pull colder
air is
necessary it's recommended but if you
can't get that cooler to face the front
and you have to face it down this was
the case with some older hyper t4
coolers and the old am3+ socket then you
have no choice right either to arrange
it from the top or from from down below
I guess you couldn't face the cool it
from the top and have it pull in that
way but then you're just pulling dust
and stuff heat rises that tends to
bother people that I think I'd rather
pull her from the top and I would pull
hot air from down below especially if my
graphics card is under load someone
asked how old I am interstellar I am 23
I'll be 24 in a couple months ah let's
see jazz Garcia do you have any
recommendations for a good $50 or under
mid-tower case for an RX 580 jazz I
literally have like a $50 case review on
the channel that I recommend I recommend
spending a bit more though the fantex
350 X is a great case for 60 bucks
consider that strongly
Jorge Pena and Vega 64 worth it anymore
if you can get it for a good price I
wouldn't pay any more than about 4 400
maybe 450 for a Vega 64 I would say 400
probably my magic number though if I saw
a Vega 64 for 400 bucks I'd snatch it
but most of the time you'll find Vega 56
for that price the ranch game are $2
Canadian whatever 2 is $2 Canadian like
what is that and you it's just some just
curious I don't care how much money it
is but I'm just curious a question for
everyone Windows 7 or 7 or Windows 10
interesting question if you ask me who
for gaming Windows 7 probably in my
experience although you're gonna lose a
few Drive support I'm sure drives the
board is gonna be a little crippled on
Windows 7 most of the programs that I
use aren't gonna care one way or the
other but there are a few they're gonna
favor Windows 10 obviously get DirectX
12 support Windows 10 few other api's
but in general I'm not really picky one
way or the other that's just me there
let's see I'll answer two more questions
give me some good questions folks I need
the juicy stuff to end this one I want
to end on a really good note really good
okay $2.00 Canadians 150 US well I
appreciate that 150 US super chat Monday
Thanks
for the conversion Tec rims of the two
Canadian is 25 US cents he goes up and
down every day let's see let's see okay
I see the good stuff you guys are asking
good questions
I see the good stuff ah let's see okay
okay snow drifter with the trend to many
core CPUs with Verizon okay an Intel
following suit how long do you think
it'll be until we see more
multi-threaded support for games such
that clock speed is no longer king I
think I don't think it's this is just my
take on it I don't think it's ever gonna
catch up because I think developers have
to weigh the advancements in technology
with what a majority of their consumers
are using and even though we have a new
stuff rolling out every year every half
year depending on who you are you know a
and B took four or five years come out
with Verizon right but if you have those
incremental steps you're gonna have
people to jump on board right away but I
guarantee you have just as many people
if not more people stay behind on the
older platforms and when you have those
people still playing games that are
relatively new those developers can't
leave those people behind so people on
you know four core systems or two core
systems they're gonna you know their
fate rests in the hands of their clocks
basically because they're gonna be
bottleneck no matter what from a core
perspective but developers know that a
lot of their users are using lower core
count chips because not even we can
afford the new stuff so if you left them
behind you would discourage that
consumer and you would lose a good chunk
of your loyal fan base so there's always
a constant tug-of-war right there's
always a do I want to you know favor
people who have the new stuff obviously
they're gonna have an edge no matter
what so I think that there's more or
less an incentive to scale back a little
bit not you know I'm sure developers out
there could program games that are
optimized 20 cores beautifully but then
you know what they gain want to run
terribly on an i3 from 2015 right so
it's
question but I'm in my opinion I really
think you're gonna be held back not
because the developer can't optimize so
because they choose not to because
they'll be leaving many valuable
consumers behind that's my take I'm
interested to see what you guys think
about that as well let's see
scrolling down scrolling down Joe did
you just did you just ask Apple or Apple
Mac or PC did you I said Joe I I think
there is a very specific skillset for
Mac OS and in most cases for me that has
to do with Final Cut Pro and I've talked
about this in my mac book reviews and
whatnot but 90% of the time any time I'm
in the office when I have a desktop it's
gonna be a Windows desktop that's just
because what I use what I need Windows
is the better option for that also
hackintosh is good because our pain and
I've I looked at some of the instruction
sets for setting up a hackintosh system
you guys been asking for one of those oh
my that is a handful let's see Berlin
hey Kirk says 760 is still pretty decent
though yeah I'm one of my old cheap
builds had a 760 in it still it's still
a decent graphics card it actually is
I was surprised let's see here I just
answered your question bliss life of a
hackintosh
okay okay let's see I'm scrolling down
Patrick s would you take your pants off
on the stream absolutely nice so it's
probably banned so no let's see Joseph
can oh what's going on he says hello
Greg what's going on Joseph we have
let's see one more question one more
good question then we're gonna do our
awesome and Moche ending you guys who
stick around for the ending you're gonna
bomb you with emojis just give me a
second one more question gtx 1066 feet
worse than gtx 980 it's a good question
jonathan i would say or
that's Ryan scuse me a Reineke we'll ask
that question if you can get a 984
cheaper than a ten sixty I would say
nine eighty just yeah just because I
mean if you get a 19-4 like 200 bucks I
think that's a pretty good value but if
you can get a 1064 around 200 bucks that
is a six big 1016 out of three gigs
you'll be limited by your vigor buffer
there then I would say go with 980
unless again that 1066 key is around 200
bucks which I doubt usually and get the
984 pretty cheap you might be able to
even more right now recently because
prices have come down quite a bit but
that's just my thing
fridge Musa says notice me there you go
there just shout out Jordan spinner asks
would you consider growing out your hair
to compete with Steve I've done that
before in middle school my hair didn't
go like this all right Steve has those
beautiful locks I have this problem
where it goes this way literally I'll
grow an afro like this that's what it
becomes and there's a picture of me of
middle school sixth grade middle school
I had super long hair like I'd pull the
hair out and would come out of here but
the problem is it never grew down and
grew out and it was very difficult to
maintain and it just looked pretty bad
in my opinion especially now so that's
why I haven't grown it out very long
short hair is easier it's just it's
easier
