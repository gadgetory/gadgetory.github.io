same thing but that actually don't okay
then so what is the difference between
input lag and response time welcome to
minute science to be clear here asking
the question what is the difference
between input lag and response time is a
bit like asking what the difference is
between the senses of both touch and
sight there are two completely different
things but it's always nice to have both
in check let's tackle input lag first
input lag is defined as the delay
between a user-defined stimulus and the
display in question for instance
consider a game or pressing a key on a
keyboard the time it takes for the
screen being used to respond to this
keystroke is the degree of input lag
involved typically measured in
milliseconds as a rule of thumb input
lag generally decreases with higher
refresh rates so at 60 Hertz each image
is flashed for roughly 17 milliseconds
meaning that 17 milliseconds is the bare
minimum input lag a user will experience
when playing a game at 60 frames per
second at 144 Hertz
each preceding frame can be displayed
after 7 milliseconds less than half the
time required at 60 but there are
obviously several other factors to
consider here the use of a wireless
controller or keyboard can increase
input lag as good networking
capabilities to an extent upscaling that
is gaming in a non-native resolution
could also dramatically increase input
lag since this requires additional
processing by the screen in question to
ensure that this additional processing
is avoided especially when gaming at
native resolutions TVs and monitors will
invoke gaming modes to reduce the
overall apparent input lag so if input
lag is the sense of touch in our analogy
here essentially how a game feels then
response time is the sense of sight
predominantly how gaming looks on a
display response time is defined as the
time required for a single pixel on a
display to change from one color to
another for instance consider a car
moving across a screen if a display
features a relatively low response time
somewhere in the realm of 5 milliseconds
the car will look relatively uniform
throughout its journey however if the
response time is significantly higher
the car will look as though it is
blurred to an extent mimicking
artificial motion blur instilled in some
video games more on that right here so
in general if a object is faster moving
a lower response time is typically
desired especially when it comes to
first-person shooters you
may have heard the term ghosting which
refers to a displays tendency to produce
more than one of any given object as a
result of its relative movement and
obviously the higher the response time
of any monitor the more ghosting you
will notice so you can see how having
one of these in check without the other
can still produce a very unenjoyable
experience if the game doesn't feel or
look right it won't play right and
that's why your monitor or TV choice is
an important one in general I look for a
response time of roughly 5 milliseconds
or lower it always ends up being higher
when you actually test it yourself there
is no industry standard for this thing
although great degrade testing is very
popular among enthusiasts and while
input lag isn't something you'll find
just stamped on the outside of a
computer monitor or TV box typically any
computer monitor made within the last
two or three years should have the input
like problem in check at least for the
average gamer there are obviously gaming
monitors available for the diehards and
TVs for those more concerned with home
theater gaming there's a list of TV
input like x in this video's description
but for the most part your average
monitor advertising somewhere around a 5
millisecond response time should also
have input lag in check it would be a
disservice to the manufacturer in
question to create and promote a monitor
with terrible input lag but be cautious
they are still out there refer to
ratings and reviews before purchasing
any product in which you intend to
invest quite a large sum of money
