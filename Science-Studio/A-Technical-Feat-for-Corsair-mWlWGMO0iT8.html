sending us to Computex 2019 what's going
on everyone you're here in the Corsair
suite at the Grand Hyatt in Taipei and
we've got a lot to show you guys
regarding the hydro X series which is
their new lineup a full lineup of custom
PC cooling hardware this is uh is gonna
be a mouthful but you guys are gonna be
really impressed I think so let's go
ahead and show off some of the stuff
that they have on this first wall here
and this is pretty much every product
that they offer I don't think they've
missed anything maybe a few different
SKUs but design wise this is this is
what they have and and they stress the
importance of keeping the SKUs minimal
they don't want to have you know
thousands of different SKUs up front
they want this to be very
straightforward especially for a new
builder so they actually have a
configurator website we'll show you some
clips of that right now and it is very
simple to navigate it'll show you
exactly what your system will look like
you can pick you know your motherboard
and CPU platform all of that good stuff
and it'll basically give you a render of
what it'll look like especially if
you're choosing a corsair case to build
in so this is one of the cpu blocks call
the XC seven and it is a beautiful art
to be block it does have a plastic
shroud on the outside it's black and you
can see it's got the fins and a nylon
you know i don't want to call it glass
but it's a transparent nylon right on
top and this nylon use is important so
they've really tested this stuff we
actually kind of hinted some of these
products earlier last year and the year
before that when this you know project
was kind of starting to develop and they
they ran into a lot of issues testing
many different coolants and you guys
know that coolants are super finicky
they have a lot of coolants will react
with a lot of different components and
that's what you don't want you don't
want that corrosion you don't want that
weird kind of gunk build up especially
in your cpu blocks and so they went
through thick and thin to try to find a
material that wouldn't crack under
pressure for one and that's why they've
used this transparent nylon it's very
resistant to those kinds of forces
whereas an acrylic would split and then
start to crack because it's got a low
tensile strength nylon is very malleable
in that sense it's you can kind of you
know deform it and it can stand a lot
more pressure and so that's why they've
used this here it's actually a lot more
durable very impressive from corsair a
coarser said they're go
was to offer pretty much everything
again you would need in your first
custom loop builder if you've know us a
long time you could still go with course
their components and I'm actually really
impressed that built way about a dozen
or so hard-line builds and these
components really do follow suit with
what I'd expect quality wise from
Corsair but also to kind of blend them
with the rest of the industry and in
some ways exceed those expectations so
we've got radiators here these are
copper and brass rads so no aluminum
that's a good thing they even offered
their own fittings these have been
created in conjunction with bits power
so if you're familiar with its power
fittings these are very nice fittings
here I have experience with these and
they actually remove the logos so in
production they told bits power yeah we
don't want any logos bits power said
what you don't want any need to be sure
you don't even want your logo and of
course they said nope we're confident
they'll look really good and just that
kind of a bold look there and that's
what they did so you got these nickel
ones you've also got black ones you've
got some white ones and then coolants
they offer I believe four or five
different colors right now all of these
coolants are created by Corsair in
conjunction with Mayhem's that's how
they get some of these different colors
here you guys I'm sure have heard of
Mayhem's and they have a very solid
reputation in this space and then
throwing you a little higher up Kyle
we've got some of their graphics card of
water blocks these are beautiful this
one is actually a Strix block and you
can see that to cool the inductors and
other things over on the side because
they're pretty beefy on on that card in
particular they've actually created like
a separate bridge for that fluid to
reach over every one of these blocks has
a built in flow meter so you can see the
fluid moving especially when you're
talking about transparent fluid this is
a beautiful block also a design feature
of theirs is that they don't have any
screws with the heads on this side of
the block so if you want to turn this
block sideways or vertically like
they've done here you're not gonna see
any screw heads and to show off all of
these sweet components everything in
here again Corsair when it comes to the
custom cooling so again they've offered
pretty much everything you'll need for
your first custom loop this is a soft
tube Bend we've got two I believe these
are Vega 56 graphics cards and they're
dedicated blocks and then I can see the
subtle course their branding looking
very nice I like the RGB its subdued it
it's enough what I really like is the
CPU block with that kind of RGB
underglow so it'll light up the
perimeter of the block on the
motherboard itself looking mighty fine
this by the way is an x5 70 build so
you'll see builds like this very soon
around July August I'm sure and a lot of
different tech tuber channels but this
build is really nice I like the color
scheme and again just to show you what
all these components look like when they
are blended together also a nice little
Easter Egg here what does this look like
to you guys have you shown from the top
Kyle from the top down what does that
look like to you that looks like Corsair
Dom Platts ddr4 doesn't it and so
they've actually taken the exact same
design cue they've made this the exact
same way this kind of brushed metal and
they've included that for the bridge
mounts for each of these graphics card
water blocks so very subtle things that
they've done to really set these off
distinguish their brand from other
competitors and the prices are actually
fairly competitive you get back plates
included with their graphics card water
blocks something you won't find from
from other companies out there and you
get like mounting hardware when you buy
the reservoir pump combo you get all the
included sensors things you'd expect
when you're paying this much for an
expensive custom cool build Corsair has
honestly done a great job here and to
top things off they're going to send us
a hydro x kit so we can build our own
custom loop and yeah so this will be
really exciting my first time actually
getting to build with Corsair custom
cooling components it just sounds so
weird but you know they make premium
products and it just feels like they
told me that they didn't like the fact
that they had to use other companies
custom cooling components for their
builds and so they said what we can do
that we'll do it ourselves
so they they've done a great job so far
and I can't wait to build stay tuned for
that video and more coverage here at
Computex 2010 you guys have been awesome
thanks for watching and thanks for
learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
