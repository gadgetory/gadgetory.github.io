to chop it oh yeah much better now I
know gamers Nexus already beat us to the
first parity I figured I would actually
take the time in this video to explain
in detail how sponsored video spots
really work they tend to be
controversial at best
I mean ouch and this comes with the
stigma of paid promotions in general
dedicated videos almost always feel
forced to some extent so I usually try
to include a giveaway or two as I've
done in the past but when you see a
dozen or so large tech channels
uploading the exact same vacuum video
with you know twist for each channel you
got to wonder what went on behind the
scenes so this is how sponsored videos
work to be quiet dark bass 700 brings
luxury in silence to the mainstream
luxury thanks to subtle RGB integration
full case modularity and even USB type-c
support and silence thanks to 3 included
silent wings 3 fans and sound damping
foam all around click the link in this
video's description for more details
when a company reaches out to you
typically via email it's the first form
of communication with a proposition they
will tend to keep it rather vague in
fact most of them won't even use the
word sponsored if they do it's usually
some unethical requests like this one
here
I've even blurred the sender's name and
product because I'm not really here to
point fingers but this is essentially a
request for a paid review more on my
feelings about that right here so this
is the first step the outreach usually
companies send these emails out in mass
hoping for a few bites early on they can
usually go for pretty cheap too and if
they don't receive the interest they're
looking for they'll send a second wave
of emails with a money pitch like this
one here the first email was a general
email forwarded to several tech tubers
and as if promoting an ad blocker wasn't
shady enough for a tech tuber this
company proceeded to ask in just a few
days later what my rate would be for a
sponsored video I of course declined now
to be fair smaller companies are usually
the ones taking this approach the big
ones like Dyson usually cut straight to
the point they want you they're gonna
let you know that they do and for
channels with millions of subscribers
we're talking thousands and thousands of
dollars some of you would be blown away
by how much money some of these ads
for I see nothing wrong with it so long
as they're disclosed appropriately so if
Linus gets paid $50,000 for an ad spot
good for him as long as he's upfront and
honest about the fact that it is an ad
paid video spots meant to look like
reviews or honest opinions are the ones
that I would regard as shady and
everyone seems to have a slightly
different stance on this with my Intel
paying video for example I had very
little wiggle room and I did this close
up front this was paid they wanted
things present it in a very specific way
I actually had a script and that's how
some companies choose to run things on
the YouTube side I prefer not to have a
script but if they want that hate
they're paying right there my boss so
it's ultimately their say-so but with
that said there comes a point when
promoting certain products or go vacuum
cleaners it gets a bit carried away I
mean no one wants to see 10 vacuum
videos uploaded within the same one hour
time span from 10 big tech tubers it's
just distasteful I don't think the
marketing strategy there was that sound
not really fault of the youtubers more
or less the fault of Dyson who saw the
need to bombard viewers with concurrent
non subliminal advertising but that's
how negotiations typically play out said
company requests the full-length ad and
will usually provide a little leeway for
creativity they don't want all of their
videos to be exactly the same everyone
would get tired of them after the first
or second view and you would have a
really negative response after the video
has been produced it's sent to the
company for final revisions and approval
and then the publishing date is set C
because we're being paid they're in
charge so we have to run the videos by
them for final approval before we can
finally publish them for all of you to
watch we're essentially contractors in
the same right we're also contractors
for YouTube that's a separate point but
you get the gist the cool companies
leave it open for you to decide how to
present the product in the case of Dyson
right Linus decided to mesh it with his
studio tour make sense you don't want
the whole video to be able to vacuum
cleaner because that's just not like
Linus tech tips and you can kill two
birds with one stone it actually says
two birds with one phone who wrote this
hardware canucks took a different
approach they decided to talk about the
various applications and performance
more or less like a downright review or
showcase which I guess is cool but when
you're not used to doing many vacuum
reviews on a tech channel they can be
misconstrued and people don't tend to
appreciate content that's out of the
norm I know I've tried that
with car videos so when these videos are
uploaded to the platform we are required
to select the paid promotion button
which is usually a trigger for many
people to automatically dislike the
video and that's completely fine you
have the right to do that but we do also
have the obligation to disclose so it's
not like we can really help it I don't
expect much of what you've heard here to
be new or enlightening in fact most of
what you've probably heard here you've
heard repeated in other videos as well
but I at least want you guys to
appreciate the fact that my colleagues
were transparent about their agreements
with Dyson most also refrained from
turning into a pay to review which is a
no-no in my book if you like the skit
maybe like the video the content sure
let us know by giving this video a
thumbs up we appreciate it thumbs down
click subscribe but if you haven't
already stay tuned for more content like
this this is science studio thanks for
selling out with this I'm just kidding
well yeah I'm not really kidding you do
kind of sell out but you get a sell out
in style
