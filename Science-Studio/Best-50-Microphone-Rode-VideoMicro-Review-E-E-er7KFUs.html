we're gonna talk about some budget
oriented hardware you might be
interested in if you want to get into
some form of content creation in this
case we're gonna talk about a microphone
that cost about 50 bucks
that'll give you some pretty decent
audio you're actually listening to it
right now on my camera it's not the
built-in microphone on the camera but
it's a microphone the emails at the top
of the camera that does not require a
dedicated power source and just plug
straight into your camera and boom there
you go pretty crisp audio for the price
and we're gonna talk about some of the
things that this can do what it can't do
how far away you need to be from the
source in order to make your voice still
sound pretty crisp and then of course
we'll do some audio comparisons between
this microphone the built-in camera
microphone and then something like an
XLR interface that should be our
standard if you will
so the microphone a question has been
pretty popular lately on YouTube people
are searching for left and right because
they want to know what they're getting
right for that fifty dollar investment
when they buy a product from a company
called Road which is very reputable in
the audio space most people know road
for their to $300 shot than mics that
have dedicated power supplies you
actually know power supplies um I mean
just batteries that you would insert the
microphones to give them that deeper
condenser sound similar to what you
would give to the next LR mic in this
case though we're just powered straight
up by the preamps and the camera and a
lot of people want to know what you're
getting right for that $50 investment is
it worth buying a reputable product from
Road but for only 50 bucks it seems to
defeat the purpose so that's what this
video will seek to do make your decision
just a bit easier now I understand there
are other competitors out there the tax
star scg 598 I think is what it's called
that's more of a traditional shotgun
microphone and that is actually a bit
cheaper than the video micro that might
be another one you're considering I have
it linked in the video description I've
used it myself
I recommend it if you don't want to
spend more than about 30 bucks or so but
if you can shell out 50 to 60 getting a
rode micro is going to be a really safe
bet and you're not gonna be disappointed
with the sound quality McKown you're
listening to it right now it almost
sounds as though you're you're hearing
this through an XLR interface the the
lows are a bit absent we'll talk about
that when we actually do the legit sound
tests but for vlogging in general you
know face to face contact with the
camera you're not gonna be disappointed
with that audio quality alright now i'm
sure you want to get straight to the
audio test is what we're gonna do is
we'll be the bulk of this video it's
kind of the point of this video to begin
with so I'm gonna often switch between
the XLR interface I'm using and the
video micro pay attention to this
section of the screen I will show you
which one you're hearing currently my
XLR setup is a b-1 berenger the
microphone itself I have that wired into
a Yamaha mixer it's the mg 10x CU and
all this stuff by the way it's linked in
the description if you want to copy what
I'm doing here and then I'm using
audacity as my recording software and
syncing this up and post in Adobe
Premiere with my video clip now a perk
of going with a shot gun mounted mic
that wires directly into the camera is
that your workflow is expedited in the
sense that you don't have to sync up
audio and video clips later right what
I'll do usually is just have my video
clip with my sword
audio file underneath it and then I'll
light up my recorded audio with the
interface afterwards I try to match the
waveforms up as closely as I can and
then delete the you know the audio
that's linked to the video from the
camera and there you go but that
requires some time in this case nope not
at all I just keep the video clip as is
the audio is already synced perfectly
here are a few things you have to think
about when you're deciding between
something like a shotgun mounted mic and
an XLR mic the XLR mic is not going to
be portable in the sense that you know
unless you want to take all this with
you and then set it up somewhere else in
some other office or some of the
locations this will require more time to
set up it's not as portable because it's
all very bulky but it will give you
crisp audio so you take it with you
maybe you have some Pelican cases or
something that will be ideal but with
the shotgun mounted mic it's very
straightforward you just plug it in
power it on if it has dedicated power
and boom it's all synced up and post and
it's gonna be you know it's just easier
to take all that with you now the audio
quality usually is a bit lower when it
comes to chakra mounted mics because
they're not typically using XLR
interfaces unless you want to go with
you know some Sennheiser XLR mic so you
can mount to the top of the camera or
have wirelessly transmitted to the
camera to a receiver that's gonna cost
you around a thousand bucks you know to
get the same audio quality in a much
smaller format that's what you're really
paying for in this case there in most
cases I would say that just a typical
shotgun not to mic from Road or from tax
star will be plenty for vlogs and just
your typical travel again where these
mics shine is as close as possible to
the source so as close to my mouth as
possible it's easier to do that with a
shotgun mic because look I can get
really close to the camera assume that
it's gonna focus I don't have autofocus
on there we go I look a bit weird I have
a wide-angle lens here so I can sit
closer to the camera and not compromise
on my audio quality very much but it
does warp the image just a little bit
and this is when you're gonna have the
best audio from the video micro if I
moved about 3 feet away it's gonna
diminish a bit you know starting to hear
that reverb and echo from elsewhere now
with an XLR mic things are going to be a
bit different depending on how you have
it set up if you're using a mixer if
you're just using a regular we know a 48
volt phantom power source one of those
little boxes right they let you wire it
in that's how you get your power and
then from that box to a PC which is what
I have done in the film room you
do something like that and it it
completely imposed but you're probably
gonna have to tune up the audio right
amplify the waveform in a software like
audacity and on top of that you're
probably gonna have to cut out some
background noise if you don't have
something like a low-pass filter built
into the mic or into your mixer so a lot
of editing in post with the XLR mic but
again you do get that crisper sound with
the shotgun mic I usually don't touch it
at all this is these are both by the way
completely unedited apart from matching
the the volumes of each this is what
each sounds like it's stock volume so
both are pretty pretty quiet but the
video micro is a bit louder right now
because what I have done is I've
basically boosted the volume in the
camera and the preamps and the g85
aren't too bad you're not hearing too
much static either so what you're
hearing now is the stock g85 microphone
or right is they're actually stereo
speakers so you might be hearing I'm
gonna be slightly louder on this side
now or slightly louder on this side it
really depends on the orientation as
well but they're not too bad for what
they are again more ideal for POV stuff
because of the positioning of the mics
but you could probably get away with
something like this at least temporarily
I still do think the video microphone 50
bucks is a heck of a value it'll
drastically improve your audio a couple
collections by the way that rode
includes with the video micro you do get
a dead cat which is useful for outdoor
situations when it's pretty windy it'll
block a lot of that win from peaking
those waveforms and that's something
that really it's really difficult and
frustrating to deal with and post right
because you have to basically drop the
entire waveform in and even then it's
still peaking right it's flatlining
where otherwise would have peaked
it wasn't adjusted so it's just a mess
and having a dead cat which is actually
what I've had on this entire time it
won't affect really the indoor audio as
much and my muffler just a tad but
outside is really where it shines and
it's nice that you get one included for
around 50 or 60 bucks you also get that
wrench snazzy red spiral or Road cable
to connect to the microphone to the
camera both ends are three-and-a-half
millimeter jacks so it's you know it's
something you could replace very easily
nobody liked the stock one because it's
not too long you don't have to worry
about wrapping it around your microphone
or your camera it just kind of sits
there and doesn't really impede much of
anything rode also includes a shock
absorbing mount system with the video
micro pretty sweet from around 50 bucks
this has a typical you know Universal
hot shoe at the
virtually any camera and then up top you
have a u-shaped shock absorber this is a
pretty good job of mitigating on-one
sounds from hitting the mic you know if
you jolt the camera really fast now just
so you guys get an idea of what goes on
pretty much every day here this is the
sexually an old mattress box this has
all of my custom loop gear in it up you
know it fittings radiators CPU blocks
graphics card blocks reservoirs all
that's in this box I should have more of
it in the other room all my fittings are
there some of them anyway so to sum
things up one last time I think this
microphone is a great value I don't
regret purchasing this I bought it
myself so lean on throats not telling me
to say anything it's how it is with all
reviews on this channel won't be told
what to say and I won't receive payment
for a review and and actually I think
going out and buying it myself will
leave me even more objective not because
you know I feel like I got to justify
what I spent but because if I don't like
it I'll just return it and there you go
there's my review in a nutshell
I don't want to return this because I'm
very satisfied with the purchase 50 to
60 bucks for this thing you can find it
linked in the video description it's
gonna give you a quality audio
especially up close and even from far
away I mean it's not too bad you can see
it starts to diminished quality wise you
hear the echoes starting to take over
but it's still a much better choice than
choosing the stock built-in microphones
and most cameras and that's really what
I want to point out in this video it's
great for portability you can take it
really anywhere you want because it's
super small it packs down and hey it's
from a reputable company like Road if
you liked this video be sure let me know
they give someone thumbs up I appreciate
it thumbs down for the opposite or if
you hate everything about life now you
can click Subscribe but if you haven't
already I'd appreciate that and the bail
notification icon if you want to be
notified with videos like these go live
so you can watch it as soon as possible
I might even respond to you because I
stick around for an hour after the video
publishes this is science video thanks
