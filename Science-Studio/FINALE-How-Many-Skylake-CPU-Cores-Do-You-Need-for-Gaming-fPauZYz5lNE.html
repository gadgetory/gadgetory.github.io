tested one core with one thread one core
with hyper-threading a triple core
scenario but this this is golden for
those of you tuning in for the first
time a welcome aboard
we've been disabling cores on hyper
threads in an effort to scrutinize CPU
core scaling and modern and popular
triple-a titles the only exception being
csgo you can start here if you're
interested in watching from the
beginning or stick around for everything
to be thrown at you all at once although
there are a few pretty funny parts in
part 1 let's quickly review the test
bench it's that right there my own
personal rig for every scenario you're
about to see 16 gigabytes of ddr4 clock
to 3000 megahertz was used not the RAM
you're seeing now mind you an asus strix
rog gtx 1070 running its stock and an
Intel Core i7 6700 K whose cores and
hyper threading capabilities will be
enabled and disabled starting from one
core and one thread all the way up to
four cores and eight threads the CPU has
also been held at 4.4 gigahertz
throughout for the sake of consistency
remember we're doing this purely from a
scientific standpoint manipulating any
other variables in this experiment would
be pointless as the only thing we're
trying to do here is determine the
number of cores necessary to game at a
fairly demanding resolution 1440p in
game settings were liberally tuned as
you'll see in the graphs it's about that
time actually here they are first in the
list as usual the well balanced PC port
GTA 5 at max settings and no
anti-aliasing to spare the GPU of
unwanted stress we see a fairly odd
trend yes as core count increases the
framerate does as well but that's as far
as it goes
hyper fitting really doesn't help out
grand theft auto I first noticed this in
my i3 versi 5 video that you can check
out right here long story short it's the
physical cores that matter in a game
like this by the way the C stands for
core and the T stands for thread so if
the thread count is double the core
count it means that hyper threading was
enabled in that scenario
now then jumping from say a Pentium to
an i3 won't make much of a difference in
a game like grand theft auto 5 I've
actually confirmed that with those
physical processors as well and yes I
know level 3 cache varies but it won't
significantly impact overall frame rates
in a well optimized game remember in
this case it's constant as is clock
speed for that matter but
cpu's these scenarios represent will
vary slightly CPU clock speed doesn't
change very much in game either believe
it or not and I've proven that in a
series right here on to City skylines
notably very CPU intensive it definitely
shows and you know what else shows the
frame rate increase when hyper threading
is enabled hence the rather linear trend
here what's likely going on here city
skylines is pushing a large amount of
parallel data to the CPU in which case
an adept scheduler and a hyper threaded
environment would surely help the more
threads the more data can be processed
simultaneously if GTA v is in hyper
threading optimized it won't know how to
send more information to the dispatch
and schedulers Cities is doing quite the
opposite simply pushing as much data as
needed through the pipelines to be later
processed and rendered by the GPU ashes
that the singularity is very bizarre in
another way here essentially any core
account above 2 is ideal what you're
seeing towards the top is something
often referred to as the law of
diminishing returns we discuss it
extensively in economics at some point
adding another stimulant in this case a
physical core changes almost nothing and
it shows up like a brick wall at the
three core boundary another interesting
note here is how much better the
hyper-threaded triple core simulation
performed over the quad core non hyper
threaded scenario when a game was
optimized in such a way that it benefits
from hyper threads a CPU with more of
them should in theory trump a CPU with
less of them pass a certain point
regardless of how many physical cores
there are we didn't see this in cities
but we do definitely see it here let's
throw it back for a second csgo how do
you think this one will react when more
cores are thrown at it well believe it
or not a lot like GTA 5 in fact in a few
instances particularly above the three
core boundary hyper-threading appears to
hurt the overall framerate the reasons
range far and wide but one theory
involves parallelism
if csgo sends information to the CPU in
a linear fashion then enabling hyper
threading will only stress the decoder
and instruction pipeline at this point I
really can't avoid it let's use the
Linus analogy if hyper threading is a
bit like eating with two hands as he
says in his tech wiki video but you're
chewing and swallowing at a rate slower
than either hand is preparing food
you're just wasting energy using two
hands instead of one which might even be
able to accomplish the task faster now
that you're not using additional energy
on the second hand it's an
oversimplification yes but if the
scheduler has data ready to be processed
for the core demands it without
hyper-threading then what good is
hyper-threading we don't see this trend
in too many modern games but csgo is
definitely a victim here you could even
make the case for GTA 5 check out the
full hyper-threading video from tech
wiki in this video's description let's
move on
total war Warhammer oh is this one
strange
so it's a very CPU dependent game pretty
much like every total war game in
existence but this one falls into that
category for a different reason
it doesn't need many cores it just needs
a few fast ones check the sound the
difference between a single
hyper-threaded core and a full-fledged
i7 6700 K in terms of averages equates
to just a couple of frames sure minimums
are significantly lower we see these
flattened out of the three core boundary
but the average framerate trend is a
testament to differing strategies when
it comes to game coding Total War took a
different route than most that's for
sure last up is battlefield one beta I
had to test this one first
chronologically because it recently
closed for the upcoming official release
as it's a relatively new game these
scores are subject to change and my
benchmarking methods were admittedly not
the smoothest but again above the three
core boundary there isn't much of a
difference in terms of neither minimums
nor averages stay tuned for revisited
benchmarks once the full game does go on
sale so what do you think of the grand
finale folks did anything catch you by
surprise let me know in the comments
below be sure to give this video a
thumbs up if you thought it was cool
give it a thumbs down you feel it can be
opposite or if you have no idea what
you're doing here be sure to click
Subscribe but if you have already a not
really know what I'm gonna do next maybe
something about the iPhone se in the
Apple watch it severed even something
about a mag I also have a few
head-to-head mashups between the MacBook
and things like the XPS 13 and the razor
blade stealth I get my hands on either
of those I'll definitely have those
videos uploaded this is science studio
stay tuned
thanks for learning with this
