all of you from the past because right
now it's still 2016 so it's a little
weird but I am here to bring to you a
brand new motherboard from asrock the
extreme 4 based on these z2 70 chips
that you heard it right folks this
motherboard supports the Intel KB Lake
CPU lineup this is a premium motherboard
from the Taiwanese company targeted
toward the overclocking enthusiast in my
opinion it's gorgeous no two ways about
it it's unique packed with features and
comes with white accents a personal
favorite let's take a tour so as I just
mentioned the z2 70 chips that supports
processors up to the 7700 K in Intel's
KB Lake line up the Z indicates an
unlocked multiplier meaning that
overclocking potential is limitless with
any case cue CPU but that's not all
this and most other KB Lake board
supports skylake processors out of the
box no BIOS update required I threw my
i7 6700 K into the socket to verify I
had a few problems with the initial boot
wasn't getting a post so I receded the
CPU and clear the CMOS and voila good as
gold been that way ever since
and as for specifications we're looking
at a z2 70 chipset along with ddr4
support up to 38 66 megahertz and even
higher I ran my Trident Z dims from
g.skill at 32 hundred megahertz without
a hitch
you'll find two full sized
steel-reinforced PCIe 16x slots followed
by a third at the very bottom not
steel-reinforced but I doubt you'll need
the third one as well as three in the
much smaller form factor both nvidia sli
and AMD crossfire are supported on this
board and sli high bandwidth bridge is
included in the box
asus aura is as well so you can plug an
asus RGB LED strip directly into the
board and control its effects along with
those under the chipset heat sink
through downloadable software the
extreme 4 boasts a 12 phase power
delivery system with 12 K black
capacitors for excellent overclocking
potential and stability I could reach
4.6 gigahertz without a hitch on my 6700
K expect similar overclocking potential
for cable a counterparts rear i/o
consists of 7.1 audio along with optical
support and Ethernet port for USB 3.0 a
USB 3.1 port along with a type-c
connector HDMI DVI and even d-sub ports
and a ps2 interface for old-school mice
and keyboards if you're willing to pay a
bit extra you can throw in a Wi-Fi
via the m2 keee interface and run in 10a
out the rear i/o as well from native
Wi-Fi support other features of the
board include five fan hubs one of which
has a dedicated pump support 8 SATA 3
ports two USB 3.0 front i/o connectors
the 24 pin of course an array of USB 2.0
hubs a sous aura HD audio and as rocks
own purity sound for featuring the
latest real tech codec and a
multi-layered PCB four distinct audio
channels aesthetics are also a top
priority with this variant if you can't
already tell
as mentioned earlier white accents are
everywhere the entire rear i/o section
is covered by a white plastic housing
which posts a light blue LED it also
stays on 24/7 thanks to its 5 volt
source which means that you can show it
off even when the PC is turned off the
chips that heatsink is also wrapped in
these 5 volt LEDs the z2 70 description
is printed on the uppermost vrm heatsink
and the one further down is partially
covered by the rear i/o housing the PCB
itself even has a white accents you'll
notice the large X spanning the entire
board something I do appreciate the Z
270 killer variant of asrock features a
large white K so expect further branding
like this from the company in the future
I'm all for it it sets this brand apart
from its competitors and at a
respectable price a link to the Z 270
extreme for here will be in the video
subscription once available if you liked
this video or appreciate the facts give
this one a thumbs up give it a thumbs
down if you feel the complete opposite
or if you hate everything about life be
sure to click the subscribe button if
you haven't already special thanks to
asrock for sending these early so that I
could run tests on them they're great
boards I do recommend them it's why I'm
supporting one in Heisenberg right now
but you didn't know that
this is Salazar studio thanks for
learning with this
