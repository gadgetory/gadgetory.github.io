to point out that our first video has
been uploaded to our new channel
entertainment studio so if you're
craving more McLovin and love watching
kids get pwned check out en st now as
for this video i have a few things that
i think you might find very useful being
class around the dorm your bedroom
pretty much anywhere the great thing
about these products is that they're all
portable you can take them anywhere
you'd like perfect for the college
student traveler that 1q2 walks around
the halls blaring music yeah we all know
somebody like that anyway let's get to
it first up on the list is a very
impressive computer in a stick that's
that's actually the only way I know how
to describe it this one's from a company
called Azul and while packing an Intel
Atom a z3 7 3 5 F quad-core processor
into such a small compartment may not be
cutting-edge anymore this one's special
thanks to its wired land port so in the
case of the Azul quantum access mini PC
stick yeah that's that's the full name
you won't have to worry about relying on
a wireless connection for your daily web
browsing if this is the first time
you've seen a mini compute stick and the
deal with these are that you can plug
them into virtually any TV or monitor
boasting an HDMI port simply plug in the
device connect power connect your
peripherals I recommend a wireless
keyboard and mouse combo like this one
here and boom you've turned your
television or monitor into a computer
it's great for YouTube surfing streaming
movies like desk work and the frequent
traveler it won't play many games and to
be fair it wasn't designed for gaming
like at all but it will run things like
minecraft without a hitch just make sure
you have enough storage
the Azul stick does offer a port for
expandable microSD card storage which
will relieve some of that stress the
only complaint I have lies not with the
Azul stick but with the technology in
general since it relies on an HDMI
connection it requires a supplementary
power source so not only might you have
a LAN cable running from this thing
you'll also have a power cable sprouting
from its side HDMI torch says that the
hub can adequately supply enough current
for low power inputs however it is
recommended that most devices use an
external power adapter to eliminate
potential issues the Azul although
efficient is not low power by these
standards I mean we're talking milliamps
when it comes to HDMI ports so expect
this to be the norm for quite some time
you can find a link to this particular
as all quantum axis mini PC stick in
this video's description
seriously though come up with a good
name not a long name up next is
something relatively cheap cool-looking
and cool and functionality a laptop
cooling stand while this won't tell
passively cooled laptops very much mean
they're not designed to be cooled with
fans something like my Lenovo 100 s
would fall under this category you can
also check it out in the video's
description and in the video right here
coolers like this one from accessory
power go a long way when it comes to
laptops relying on internal fans meet
the enhanced GX c1 it's large enough for
most laptops durable equipped with five
quiet fans and super cheap twenty bucks
I recommend this product to anybody's
sick and tired of an especially hot lap
it's even great for desk if you don't
mind the incline you can adjust that by
the way you're looking at the blue
version here although it does come in
red for the same price each fan pushes
air through the platform up into the
computer itself and since laptops
generally pull in air from their bases
and exhaust out the side you'll be doing
your air hungry laptop a favor with the
GX c1 and you can find it in this
video's description
up next is something that I find comes
an oddly handy at the most unexpected
time if you're a casual videographer or
photographer or even a professional one
of either of those you know what it's
like to not have your main camera at the
most inopportune time cue the smartphone
but these cameras are limited not only
by their small apertures but lens angles
that on top of the inability to take
close-up shots and getting only half the
shot or being too far away can be just
as frustrating is not having the shot at
all aki has something for that meet
their two and one wide-angle macro lens
combo model PLW do 5 this one caught my
attention because it's universal they do
sell lens kits designed specifically for
say the iPhone but unless you plan on
using only one phone for ever
I recommend the universal kit it
includes a padded clamp lens cleaner and
storage bag and of course the lens combo
it works well even with front-facing
cameras so if you're looking to spice up
your phone camera even if you're
sporting the latest and greatest iphone
or galaxy device which I am NOT
consider the Aki lens kit you can find
the product in this video's description
surprise surprise so last time I list is
something that I expected to fall short
of my
well expectations but it didn't not even
close
in fact I'm impressed by it so much I'm
emailing this company back to request
another meet the gbb third-generation
Bluetooth speaker equipped with an IP x4
splash proof rating this means that you
can set it by your pool splash around it
a few times and still expect the thing
to pump out and beautiful sound just
don't drop the thing in the water not
waterproof splash proof and I'm glad
that they made that explicitly clear on
their Amazon product page speaking of
which how does this thing sound I've got
my blue Yeti microphone up top you can
hear my voice the way it sounds right
now it's pretty clear right so let's see
how clear this thing is go ahead and
power it on first our on Bluetooth mode
to be clear you're asking the question
what is the difference between input lag
and response time is a bit like asking
what the difference is between the
senses of both touch and sight there are
two completely different things but it's
always nice to have both in check let's
tackle input lag first input lag is
defined as the delay between a user okay
so yeah pretty awesome right dual five
watt speakers packed inside easily
sounds ten times better than a smart
phone speaker gets extremely loud while
maintaining clear undistorted waveforms
and works with Bluetooth devices up to
30 feet away you can speak into it
thanks to its built-in microphone
control playback and stereo volume
thanks to its onboard controls and clip
it onto something if you're the
forgetful type I am as well so don't
worry about that it even features enough
see support battery life is also great
this one lasts me easily a full day of
audio playback and recharges via a micro
USB port so pretty much universal and
you can pick one up in either army green
or black for under 40 US dollars nothing
to complain about I'm usually quite
critical of products from brands I've
never heard of before but I really I
really can't think of anything to
complain about
actually there is one thing I could
complain about getting to the microUSB
port and the auxiliary port that's a
challenge there's a rubber little door
here and the little little lip here is
is too small to actually just pull up
with your fingers you have to use
something like the guitar pick to get
down in there and pry it up but yeah
that's that's just I don't know I guess
I should have thought that through but
apart from that I mean everything that
the speaker was designed to do it does
very well much better than I would have
expected it to
for under 40 US dollars you can find
this product as well surprised again in
this video's description for those going
back to school I wish you the very best
study very hard for those on the daily
grind to keep on grinding and keep on
learning this is science studio thanks
for learning with this
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
