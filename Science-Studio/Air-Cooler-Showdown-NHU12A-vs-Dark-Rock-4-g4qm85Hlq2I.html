the dark rock for from be quiet not
because we haven't done that in the past
I actually used this cool it's exact
test bench and pretty much all of our
case reviews ever since the beginning of
2019 or so so I am just trying to get a
baseline because we are running this as
an open air test bench you can see I've
got really expensive test bench here
behind me a motherboard box basically
and so once we get the baseline I've
been burning this in for about thirty
minutes I'm just gonna track temps there
and then I'm gonna throw in the in actua
Nhu 12a which is a cooler I'm sure
you've seen on a few other channels and
by this point I think that there's a
fair comparison behind though between
the dark four and the u 12 a the u 12 a
has one extra heat pipe seven versus six
but they're about the same size so we'll
see how they do
it's easy to look past certain things
but an activate Windows watermark yeah
not one of those things snag a verified
Oh am Windows 10 key from SCD key for a
little over ten bucks and enjoy a fully
activated OS without the annoying
compromises use offer code a studio for
an 18 percent discount on your order one
of the things I wanted to do very
quickly will show you how we stress test
the CPU and GPU for these kinds of
videos I use out of 64 because I just
think it's a very consistent I like the
UI I'm familiar with it many ways I
could do this I could stress the GPU
individually using like superposition or
3dmark I could stress the CPU with
blender or Cinebench like that's all
fine but I like that this is all
integrated and I can stress both at the
same time within the same program so it
doesn't really matter very much how you
stress test as long as you're stressing
to the degree that you want right so 100
percent utilization 75 percent
utilization whatever but you want to
keep it consistent across runs so in
this case when we switch the CPU cooler
I'm not going to touch anything in the
BIOS in this program I'm just gonna run
it again and we'll be able to compare
just side by side without any other
variables for the most part at play so I
just stopped the test we let it burn in
for about 37 minutes I'll be sure to run
the the Noctua test for the same amount
of time now we're gonna come up here to
the statistics tab and it's gonna show
you the mins and maxes for the entire
run so you can see our CPU cores peaked
at 89 degrees Celsius and our GPU at the
diode reached 60 degrees Celsius yeah
that's not the best temperature this CPU
honestly kind of missed the mark when it
came to the silicon lottery actually it
totally missed the mark so this is not a
very good one
not a very good overclockable chip
especially considering we have a 200
plus TDP cooler on top of this thing we
are using do bower carbon op pads though
and that is something I'll show you when
I remove the be quiet cooler this will
keep things very consistent when it
comes to quote unquote thermal paste
application because we don't have to use
that anymore we can use a thermal pad it
keeps the barrier between the IHS and
the CPU cooler very consistent alright
now we've got the PC powered off I'm
gonna go ahead and switch that off and
we will cycle power one thing I will
discuss after we run through the
temperature test is the difficulty with
installation so this cooler is actually
easy to install it's much easier than
the dark rock Pro 4 which is a much
bigger cooler just because the
clearances here for like the screws like
the two Phillips screws on either side
of this little strut bar that goes
across the cooler just much easier to
access we'll see how that differs with
the Nhu 12a and if it is any easier
overall very briefly wanted to show you
the hardware setup here the installation
parts involved and be quiet looks to be
a bit more complicated and that's really
just due to the fact that they have less
pre-installed already out of the box as
you can see we've got the Phillips
screws here pre-installed over the cold
plate for the Noctua cooler
and we've also got pre installed a
little standoffs here backplate I have
them actually inserted here but they
don't come pre-installed with the be
quiet cooler not that it matters I mean
like this is like tiny self I'm just
trying to show you the small differences
also between the two coolers so make it
low here the Knox of a cooler is
slightly thinner from a front to back
aspect than the be quiet cooler can seem
to be quite coolers thicker from top to
bottom in this orientation what I think
will make up for it though is the extra
heat pipe so we have an extra heat pipe
here with an actual cooler the coal
plate is also slightly larger I've
noticed and the be quiet cooler really
just has it what looks like slightly
denser thinner a and then yeah I mean
that's really about it I'd say these
coolers are gonna be very close to each
other and the differences are gonna be
very very small
so let's get to installing an aqua cool
and I'll let you know if the
installation process was in fact any
easier
all right and yes the binocular was
definitely the easier cooler to install
also thanks to its slightly narrower
form factor we have a bit more clearance
here for our ramp so even with the front
fan installed we could put modules in
all four slots with the be quiet cooler
we'd have to use a smaller 120mm fan up
front and then hopefully you know fix
some of that high clearance but you
still probably wouldn't be able to put
some beefy modules in there like Corsair
Dom Platts or something of the like
another difference worth mentioning the
natural cooler comes with two 120mm fans
these are great fans by the way they're
slightly maybe is an
understatement ugly in my opinion but
they do the job very well next a very
quiet we'll talk about sound test here
in a second so I'm not gonna cripple the
notch of a core I am gonna run test
though with just a single fan installed
and then two fans to see the difference
there we'll compare both to the dark
rock four so here are these summarize a
graph starting first with CPU core
temperatures you can see that our two
fan in h-12 UI config is actually
running a bit hotter and this might have
to do the fact that we're running an
open-air test bench if we seal this off
in a case it might benefit the computer
to have two fans instead of one
especially if the case is rather
restrictive when it comes to airflow the
single fan config was seventy six point
nine degrees on average and then eighty
one point eight for the dark rock four
maximums are pretty much the same story
eighty five degrees Celsius for both
Noctua runs and then eighty nine degrees
Celsius for so a four degree Celsius
jump on the NOC shua to the dark rock
for next up we have sound how loud each
cooler was under load obviously the two
fan knocked to a config was the loudest
forty two point two decibels and then a
single fan config dropped that down to
forty point two and just another reason
to opt for a single fan convey Gaia I
hope Noctua does offer that in the
future dark rock for 38.1 this is a
pretty big difference to decibels
doesn't sound like a lot but it is
I just based on the logarithmic scale
that we're talking about here so the
darker four was noticeably quieter under
load by the way I was going to test it
idle as well but it was difficult to
zone out the background noise here it's
just I can't help my neighbors and it's
Bike Week this week so yeah but once
things got really loud right when the
coolers were under load it was easier to
distinguish those from the background
but both of these coolers at idle were
pretty much in autumn
I would say you'd be hard-pressed to
hear it especially if that build is in a
case last up we have price in USD so I
just looked up Amazon and Newegg prices
here the dark rock for selling on Amazon
right now for 75 bucks and the Nhu 12a
is selling on Newegg for about a hundred
bucks so you're saving 25% twenty-five
dollars by choosing the dark art for
over the NH 12 a and what I really think
could be not to his competitive
advantage here is if they offer just a
single fan instead of the dual fan
config that you get stock in the box
that could potentially lower the price
of the unit down to around 80 bucks I
mean these fans sell for 20 30 bucks a
pop they're good fans I would still
probably choose silent wings three just
because they tend to be a little lower
tone and that's a little harder for most
humans to hear in my opinion so I think
that that design is optimal so I'm not
too thrilled about the fact that we have
two fans and we're actually paying extra
for that as well now at this point I
kind of feel like I'm in the middle of
the intel verse AMD debate with respect
to these coolers because while the
Noctua cooler is definitely the better
cooler it's probably the best cooler
I've ever tested in this form factor
like for its size I actually think it is
the best cooler I've ever tested that's
saying something it's a lot smaller than
the HD 15 but it performs like an HD 15
so that's an incredible feat for not you
a good job while it is the better one it
is also the more expensive one by 25
percent 25 USD that's nothing to I mean
that might sound small to some of you
but 25 bucks that goes into a better
graphics card better motherboard better
case and you could spend that money in a
lot of different ways so if you want the
head room maybe you want to just save
money there's nothing wrong with saving
money the dark rock 4 in my opinion is
the winner if you're going for your
performance you want to squeak out the
most you can out of your CPU then the
u12 a is the better cooler so you see
it's kind of yeah pick a side all right
if you're gonna make me pick eight times
out of 10 it be the dark rock 4 I'm
pointing that way because it's sitting
over there disassembled and I say that
for three reasons first off it's cheaper
second off it's quieter and third it
looks better that's my preference I
prefer coolers that don't look like dirt
and not show fans kind of do look like
they're look you could smack some
max fans on there and it look great but
that's more money you got to spend
out-of-pocket right so I don't really
advise that it'd be nice if not to a
shift chrome expands with these coolers
or better yet just took out the second
fan which I find to be redundant at
least in my testing brought that price
down to 80 bucks then I would have a
dilemma 5 out of 5 I mean literally at
five times out of 10 I choose an octave
cool or five times out of 10 I choose it
to be quite dark rock 4 but I think in
this case the dark rap 4 wins because
it's a better value it's AMD it's kind
of hard to deny good value but if you're
going for sheer performance you 12 a is
where it's at so I've linked both down
below you can pick if you're into buying
either of these coolers I bid you
farewell it's going to be a tough choice
but I can tell you you're really not
gonna go wrong with either of these and
if you have like a closed-off case or
whatever then in my opinion the not to a
cooler despite its slightly louder
profile is definitely better in terms of
RAM clearance and sheer performance you
guys like this video thumbs up I
appreciate it thumbs down for the
opposite or if you hate everything but

you haven't already and I'll catch you
