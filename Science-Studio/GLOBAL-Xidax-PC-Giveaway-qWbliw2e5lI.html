change of pace Here I am at Lisa's house
that's because she's not a US citizen
yet so would be traveling expensive
plane tickets and the works anyway we're
headed to Barcelona here soon so that
I'd be finally we'll find a tech market
or two to tour but for this video I want
to announce a PC giveaway if you haven't
already read the title that seems pretty
obvious by this point you're not
following side XP see social media
accounts or subscribe to their
newsletter we are giving away the PC
that we reviewed in this video right
here so what you're looking at now are a
few shots of the bill from the previous
video and I can tell you it's a very
beautiful bill considering it is
pre-built you get that custom cables in
there a white case an excellent power
supply rx 590 I believe as well as a
risin 5 CPU so it's gonna pretty much
crushed any game in 1080p or 1440p
especially for the price it is gonna
come at around a thousand bucks maybe a
little over that course if you buy a
prebuilt from ZX or others you're going
to spend a bit extra for that pre-built
markup but I mean hey it looks like a
custom-built PC if you'll have the time
to do it yourself then there's a viable
option for you in the market special
thanks again to zai attacks for making
this giveaway possible for setting the
build in the first place and for taking
that feedback constructively and using
it to actually lower the prices of the
x6 and others just a bit as well as it's
actually lower the price in response to
our video and others and that was really
cool of them to do just at all most
companies are just gonna brush it out to
the side so yeah you get a chance to win
a PC and we also get lower prices in the
long run even if it's just a hundred
bucks or so that's still progress folks
and I appreciate that ex for taking all
of that into account as well again check
out the link below if you want to enter
let us know in the comments below what
you think about the giveaway about the
build in general it's all open down
there for you guys see this video thumbs
up you thought it was cool and he
appreciates that Ike's offering this
build in the first place for a giveaway
they're being super cool and yeah
subscribe did I miss anything else
joined but until I become a member
that's super cool of you as well we'll
catch you the next one this is sign
