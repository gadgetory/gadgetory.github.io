Studios minute science we're going to
count down the top-5 deadliest animals
on the planet stay tuned number five on
our list is the stonefish this one is
particularly dangerous because it looks
like a stone I mean literally it blends
in with its surroundings in the water
that it looks like coral this is
dangerous because divers kind of put
their hands on everything when they're
down there if you accidentally touch a
stonefish you're kind of out of luck out
there because well you're out there in
the water so that's why that one's
number five on our list it would be
higher if more deaths have been reported
by it number four on our list may look
familiar if you follow our Instagram
account number four is the poison dart
frog is's in particular the golden
poison dart frog native to the Amazon
areas of South America this thing
actually carries packets of poison on
its back natives would dip the tips of
their arrows on to these little sacs on
the back of the frogs and would use
those to not only wound but poison their
enemies we're back to marine animals
with number three this one is the blue
ringed octopus this thing is actually
super super small and it's smaller than
the diameter of a golf ball but if this
thing happens to SiC its tentacles onto
your skin you know just swimming around
in the ocean you probably will go blind
and not only that but if the thing
latches onto you for a long enough
period of time your respiratory system
will fail so keep an eye out for these
small little blue ringed octopus
swimming around in oceans and such we've
chosen the king cobra for number two not
just because it's poison is well very
poisonous but because so many people die
from this one snake in particular every
year yes anti-venom exists but the
availability of the anti-venom in the
places where this thing happens to Rome
is very very minimal but don't get me
wrong if you get bitten by this thing
you're in a heap of trouble just seven
milliliters of poison from a king cobra
is enough to kill an elephant that's
about 20 human beings look out for the
king cobra in the
these parts of the world i'll let you
have a longer look at that so that you
can you know memorize it we are back to
marine biology for our number one most
deadly and poisonous animal on the
planet this is the box jellyfish most of
you have probably heard of the box
jellyfish before but what makes this
thing so deadly and so dangerous is the
fact that it is nearly transparent in
the water if you get stung by one do not
apply any ice do not apply a heating pad
in fact one of the only natural remedies
to reduce the searing pain from a box
jellyfish is to apply vinegar to the
stung area once the toxin reaches your
bloodstream your blood begins to thicken
and your blood pressure increases this
can lead to an almost immediate heart
attack and thus death so those are our
top five most poisonous animals on a
planet I think we can agree that most of
those are extremely deadly as well if
you think that we missed any animal on
this list please leave its name and
phone number in the comments below and
we'll put them on our next top five
deadliest poisonous scariest animals
video that we put on minute science
later on this is science studio thanks
