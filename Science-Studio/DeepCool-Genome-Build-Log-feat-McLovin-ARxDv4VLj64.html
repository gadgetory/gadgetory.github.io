special about moving your current rig
into a new case because while the thing
in terms of hardware is changing the
exception being the integrated water
loop here which I'll get to in a second
the entire build just feels different in
a different case it's a bit like moving
into a new home the furniture for the
most part stays the same but their
locations along with the outside of the
home are completely different and that's
the case here I have swapped from the an
ADIZ AI crystal to the deep cool genome
this is the case with plenty of LEDs
plenty of color options and of their
signature water loop I had a lot of fun
building this one along with a good
buddy of mine who I forced to play
cameraman come along for the ride
all glass place that right there this is
actually going to mr. cameraman today
Jacob go ahead and reveal yourself oh
yeah
my name is McLovin McLovin as you can
totally see on my name badge here
provided by harley-davidson shout out is
not sponsored not leaked ava definitely
not sponsored by harley-davidson so what
we have to remove are the power supply
motherboard we need to take this off
we're not going to need the NZXT water
cooler anymore and then the graphics
card the Wi-Fi card and that is it for
now
we're gonna pop this bad boy into thick
so I'm gonna get an equal to send me
their their PCIe extension bridge so
that I can mount the graphics card right
here facing upwards so what will look
like is will have a graphics card
instead of normally sitting like this in
the case we're gonna have it sitting
like this which I think would look
absolutely baller
that looks great Greg that looks so good
okay so very cool of deep cool to label
all of their screw types which is nice
so that's eight pieces for that so this
is for hard disk drives obviously for
all your fans you need fan screws and
then you have 27 for your solid-state
drives and motherboard so that's nice
you're not to look closely if we screw
types too mushy and the right ones
that's I'm just pointing that out
because most case companies do not do
that well good on good on deep cool for
helping us out helping the helping the
little man out down here
they're good okay now the next thing
that I am going to do is Mount the water
block if you will on to the CPU the
actual pump unit so I want to probably
need directions to do that because I
have navigated let's see you might be
able to just wing it
mm-hmm maybe not well let's see okay LGA
1150 X that's what we need ah okay I
think I see how it works so yes yes I
see I got this folks
now the motherboard is secured in there
we're gonna lift this back up that's
just dangling it's kind of sketchy
inside okay oh you serious oh my god
that looks perfect I don't even know
over to the block that okay the problem
is the the four points for this are not
aligned with the case so I'm not going
to be able to push the screw in from
behind because this thing is in the way
I'm gonna have to do it with the
motherboard off of the case that is a
huge inconvenience alright so that means
I'm gonna interrupt you got to put the
camera down again my name for the camera
down yeah I'm filming such good footage
I should finish you got a great job okay
so these are the brackets there you go
across this way I'm assuming and I'm not
looking at the manual but I'm pretty
sure this is how they've designed it oh
this is a super that's like Wow okay
there's that one and then this one
getting all that Jacob oh I'm a all
laugh and adds all of it
go on yeah that's like a tight fit but
that's I guess that's a good thing so
you can just tighten them as tight as
you can with your thumb and call it a
day
okay so now we need to apply the water
block and this you know where move until
you're ready to go
you see copper base which is perfect
wrinkles not perfect but that copper is
a great conductor of heat and that's
essentially what we're trying to do here
tick away heat from the CPU so we're
screwing this into the bracket little
beam and that's what's gonna hold this
in place I think there we go now so and
so we've got a motherboard in and we've
got the water cooler all installed and
ready to go so we can start working on I
guess the power supply now and I guess
when the power supply will work on the
solid-state drive hard drive and then
we'll install the graphics card last
cable everything up oh that's it but
this huh
what's that and then do poopy you know
what need my help hey Craig do you need
my help
commute quick sister I'm I'm coming me
and Greg bouncing camera low voice per
day Suman now already look at this guy's
look how good this looks is like 250,000
subscribers I can actually afford to
hire somebody else possibly I'll hire
you as my full-time cameraman I'm doing
a great job
I'm sure you are I'll look through all
this foot did you record did you serious
I just record that what I thought it was
important
it does add that in order to add that
you don't need people to see that hey
this is one of their tf1 20s okay and
this is the fluid Barry says it's
virtually silent and we want this
exhausting because because we're gonna
have air pulled in from the front when I
put two 140s up here when I come through
the radiators going to exhaust out the
top and out the back we will have a bit
of negative air pressure inside the case
of dust might be an issue at some point
but we'll be okay you'll be okay
we don't need this in any way I'll give
you that fan for your build oh yeah
high-powered fan baby it's a very
high-powered are you getting like a look
at that close-up ladies and gentlemen
look at this close-up just listen ladies
and gentlemen look at this build so far
we are looking at one of the best
krikey may look at this let's get a zoom
in up on this I don't even know what any
of this is called at all except just we
just ran through this some that's the
motherboard yeah good motherboard
um when I heard of flashy things that
I've seen before they're not all of them
are flashy these happened to be flashing
you know no idea whatsoever the RAM okay
okay I've heard of that the CPU is under
here
mmm under there mm-hmm getting feeling
it sure I'm feeling I Gregg keep going
the pump you don't have to have a pump
you can just have an air cooler and that
is linked to the radiator of top okay I
know what those are then right and
that's how far we've done so far
mmm good it's like a review of so far
the ladies and gentlemen where we think
they've seen this before their music
their PC builds well I am so for you new
PC builders trust me I'm on your side I
have no idea what we are doing but this
footage looks great mmm this is a top
part you see that ladies and gentlemen
air is gonna be sucking down I'll
actually be going this way I'll be going
this way okay we're going this way and
then it's gonna go into the atmosphere
look at this
oh yeah they're going to be so many blue
okay so what I ended up doing was using
the 750 watt supernova from my old rig
deep cool did send their 600 watt
modular but what we're gonna do with
that instead is use this for mr.
cameraman to rig will be all yeah that's
pretty big look at my rig
like ever I still don't know what I'm
looking at but looks good it's it looks
good anyway
um okay alright so they got screws here
the one with solid-state drive
brownie just four of them leave that
determination to screw these and ha and
then a thumb screw to secure it back
into place
Oh Mike yeah Jacob
oh yeah just right cut that out
nope yep definitely can't see me thank
you for yeah you can't see from this
side at all you really got to get on
flips up on it oh yeah we need to get a
good close-up okay there so let's say dr
zakir one more piece of the puzzle we're
gonna get this hard to strap down here
mmm where is the hardest to ODIs okay
this thing out now this one on the
entities with semi toolless i didn't
explain this in detail any of you but uh
it includes a cartridge if you will and
secure it and back by four screws I'm
feeling that okay so this is your saw me
just sorry no that's fine
keep that this thing looks like it's
secured with two screws in front well
let's you see there's one right there
yeah excellent camera shake and then
there's one right there okay up to here
let's get the first one out it looks
like it's just a cage so we'll be able
to slide our hard drive in and then
secure it with the screws that are
included with the kit
oh yeah slides right in ladies and
gentlemen I want sales where it's held
in is ailing up front
nope ya see that folks a little bit of
muscle work there Greg yeah really
okay I'm gonna put this in the sway
rubberize I like that so minimal
vibrations take aways up place cameras
like ah I don't know what to focus on
that thing is secure ain't going
anywhere good job be cool don't slide
the bevel back in yeah here we go
look at this teamwork ladies and
gentlement II don't see this every day
why is there water on the lens of this
camera what is that a sweat are you
sweating in your hands yeah my back
feels really good though this is a scene
you slowly porn on my back gosh you're
sweating on my camera and we're indoors
you know sad that is um I met I'm a bit
overweight you know freshman 40 hit me
kind of like a shovel in the face but
you know what I'm not I'm not afraid to
admit it
you know sort of a review of what we put
in so far well it's it's obvious what we
put in okay well you know for me I still
don't know what half of this stuff is so
for Travis hard drive that's for storage
got a holiday chai for storage power
supply obviously the power got that one
and everything else we already showed up
from got it good look at her okay okay
you can stop with them alright ladies
and gentlemen as a smoothly sailing
we're almost done they did give us a
Fanta where is that right here see what
this is all about it's not nagging okay
I didn't know what was going on right in
but okay I thought it was a magnet wait
am I supposed to come coming another
strip maybe this thing oh yeah maybe
it's this yep this is it it's a sticky
goo that's definitely like a reach oh no
but they included an extension cable
somewhere came with it came with a kit
came with the fan where'd it go yeah
it's the one that probably flew on the
ground I don't know oh yeah oh yeah
that's the one that I reported earlier
falling mmm good job Jacob and just
ladder yeah excellent Jacob yeah oh look
at that
there we go there you oh boy I'm pulling
up the adhesive to it yeah I have baby
fingers no no really
in the sticker red perfect oh yeah that
over they didn't going anywhere
that's on there that is that's pretty
good easy so turns out we don't need the
exciting table we might for something
else though so that's okay it actually
looks really cool I'm actually down with
that looks good alright these three are
from the fans on the top of the case so
definitely cannot see them Greg with
this camera angle oh there's one of them
we got three of those bad boys yes
anyway living in one house it camera
looking by the way oh I am sweating but
you definitely cannot tell from my hands
ball your body inside of your hands were
disgusting look at the inside you yeah
I'm in Syria but moist but you know what
we're gonna look at that how are they
sweating it's like two degrees in here
cuz I'm all amped up about this build oh
my goodness ladies and gentlemen look at
this
oh isn't this just amping you up sit
back in your seats cuz you're about to
get blown over from all of these fans
baby
whoa you feeling it Greg alright back
over to you Greg how're you feeling
about this build you do know I can edit
all of this out I know but you're not oh
we have a visitor
well hello there what you doing hey you
better be chewing on my cables don't
picture on my cable woman is that Makos
making a surprise visit how we doing
there oh we're making it work well I
gotta take the front you know I don't
think they've seen the front yet I've
been getting the side
oh really yeah that's that's the icon of
the deep cool case Jane out of the light
so I think and see it need like okay no
now they can saw yeah this angle looks
sweet so yeah that's that's a part of
the loop actually so it'll run from the
water block up to the radiator and then
down through here just for the heck of
it and that's what such this case apart
from the rest other the fact that it
does have an integrated cooler wow I
cannot get this off you know so hear
that ladies and gentlemen true at that
old-school click yeah really
sounds like a I got an old compact yeah
for those of you that don't know Gregg
just got done working out about four
hours ago so he's a bit weak cuz look at
that look we ain't getting anywhere this
the case isn't even moving hardly can't
get a little that's craftsmanship right
there ladies and gentlemen it's supposed
to come off I seriously can't go though
do you really need help look at kind of
okay good stuff okay
there is fan support but it's not 140
now doesn't look like you
so the deep core genome does bring quite
a bit to the table I chose white because
well if you know me it's pretty much
automatic white will take on the color
of any RGB LED layout and doesn't clash
with much of anything else
cable mod straight hooked us up these
beautiful custom sleeved white and blue
cables which I also think ended up
playing a huge part in making this build
look as good as it did they have an
option within their website called the
configurator which allows you to choose
colors for individual cable leads
hence the alternating blue and white
you're seeing here you can select from a
variety of colors as well including two
unique textures both paracord and nylon
check out this nylon purple and green 24
pin that I had made I also got a hold of
some cable combs something I will never
ever ever go without ever again as well
as a few colored SATA cables and RGB LED
kits from their website I should also
note that even if you don't currently
own or use a fully modular power supply
you can order the cable extensions
rather than their full on cable kits to
supplement any semi or non modular PSU
as I've done here with my b2 supernova
just make sure that the cable lengths
you selected aren't too long nor too
short now this case is not without sin
as you probably saw in the build log
there are a few things that I personally
would have changed they don't include
the PCI extension cable for mounting
graphics cards vertically which is a
shame I mean why include support for it
if you don't plan on following through
another downside is actually the design
of the diagonal wall within the case
while it does look awesome undeniably
the holes in it will reveal any mess of
cables you've got hiding behind it it
took quite a while before I was able to
successfully hide all of mine however
once I managed to do so I'll have to
admit the final look did pay off there
is a graphics card cutout in this wall
for cards that are especially long but
not cards that are especially especially
long just double check before you decide
to build in this thing I am a fan of the
included water loop it looks great it
works great and keeps core temps in the
low 20s
while at idle the fans are quiet the
case does a decent job at containing and
directing airflow and the aesthetics are
next to none one final complaint I do
have about the genome is the fact that
it only supports 120 millimeter fans no
140 millimeter support at all
I tried mounting two 140s up front but
was unable to properly secure them I
just wish they had drilled a few more
leads for those larger
fans at this point the case only
supports two 120s in the front but apart
from that I am a huge fan of the depo
genome like I said I chose white but
they do offer a black with red variant
as well as a black with green variant if
the white one with the blue liquid
inside isn't really fitting your current
color scheme I'm not considering the
price of the case a pro nor a con
because I think it's just fair at 250 US
dollars you're getting enough i if you
consider the 360 millimetre loop to be
around 120 US dollars the case comes out
to around the same price I've even seen
it bundled a few times actually with a
600 watt power supply as well which
would give you even more bang for your
buck so just stay tuned for that I will
have the Amazon links to all three of
the case designs in the description of
this video
Newegg also sells them for around the
same price I typically only include
Amazon and Newegg links because those
two typically offer the lowest prices
for identical parts at least here in the
States so simply put if you know you'll
be resorting to liquid cooling for your
next PC build consider the deep cold
genome the case itself is iconic and
certainly an eye catcher it includes an
excellent integrated hassle-free cooling
unit plenty of building room and a large
acrylic side window it ultimately just
comes down to preference you could build
in the entity's AI crystal which cost
150 US dollars currently and then throw
in something like a kraken x61 from NZXT
for around the same price so you're kind
of getting the same functionality if you
will but with entirely different looks
between the two but for now I'll be
using the deep cool genome for my
personal rig I see no need to switch
back at this point and unless something
else comes along at an attractive price
point that looks even cooler than this
one haha get it I'll be sticking with
the genome for quite a while
the functionality and design of the case
just appeal to me do they appeal to you
I want to hear from you in the comments
below be sure to give this video a
thumbs up if you thought it was cool
give it a thumbs down if you feel the
complete opposite or if you hate
everything about life be sure to click
