fun I had a lot of fun building this one
and I really think my brother's going to
love it he has been needing one for a
while he's an engineering major actually
he graduated the same year I did with
his engineering degree and now he's
getting his master's in engineering so
he's gonna need a beefier system to run
some simulations of what not I think the
i-5 is gonna be enough for him
overclocked and he's also got a Vega 56
graphics card and therefore some decent
gaming as well now a quick rundown of
this PC specifications I know you could
probably see what some of these
components were just from the b-roll
shown earlier but this is sporting an
i-5 7600 kkb Lake CPU is overclocked I
believe to 4.6 gigahertz which isn't bad
for 130 watt TDP cooler and this one is
from be quiet it's linked in the video
description along with all the other
parts by the way this is the cooler
master master box light 5k so it's a
relatively cheap case but it looks
decent for the price of course the Vega
56 graphics card I've got 16 gigs of
matching team group tee force ddr4 in
there the silver on silver looks pretty
sweet and I think the only other
component haven't mentioned besides the
one terabyte hard drive which you can
see from the b-roll is the power supply
this is one from Thermaltake it's got an
RGB ring in there so you can kind of
customize the underglow of your PC so
this isn't a bad PC build for the price
you're looking at somewhere between 1300
and $1500 it's ballpark USD for these
components assuming that they are
available of course Ram prices are
pretty high right now and finding a Vega
56 card is uh well near impossible the
choice of an i5 over horizon 5 is a bit
questionable it's gonna be a better
gaming CPU in many scenarios thanks to
its higher overclock ability of course
so we don't have a suite CPU cooler on
here this is just a low profile one it
looks cool but it's not gonna actually
do the best job at cooling the CP
because it's not very large as TDP is
relatively low so we can't overclock the
CPU too much which means that under this
kind of circumstance choosing a risin 5
CPU would have been a better option this
is like I said just one that I had lying
around so that's why I used it it's
still gonna be excellent for gaming
nonetheless in terms of upgrades the
only thing I'm about to do with this
build that's not in the video because
I'm waiting for it to arrive is throw in
an SSD so that will dramatically
decrease boot times and I know people
swear by hard drive so I don't soon they
were all with hard drives but it's a
nine-day difference when you go from a
hard drive to an SSD especially for your
boot drive so that's the one thing I
plan to do here to make things just seem
a bit
snappy at least upon initial boot and a
course game storage on the hard drive
won't be an issue at all so if you like
this video maybe like this bill be sure
let me know by giving this one a thumbs
up I do appreciate that be sure to click
subscribe button if you haven't already
and stay tuned for more PC builds like
this we're gonna go cheap very soon
we're gonna go really cheap low on the
budget we're talking around 400 bucks
we're gonna see what we can build with
that in the current mark it's gonna be
pretty challenging might have to resort
to yeah I'm about to say it Craigslist I
hope you enjoyed this video folks stay
tuned for more like it this is science
studio thanks for building with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
