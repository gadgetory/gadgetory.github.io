mclovin is here with me we're in my old
room where we have Heisenberg set up
ready to go for steam VRA and be sent
over the HTC vive for about a month or
so worth of running tests particularly
with their pcs but we're going to use it
for the first time with Heisenberg
because it's more than capable of VR and
I booked both Jacob and I have never
used a virtual reality set before so
we're going to be noobs we don't even
how to set this thing up we're just
watching a YouTube video second ago
trying to figure out how to how to get
everything ready to go hashtag true so
once you get in the box here obviously
your headset you kind of need that I'm
pretty sure you don't have like speakers
included right is I like the dumbest
question ever I don't know either I
probably not only not I was this like
some extra padding I think that's for
that yeah it's for the narrow face it
says on the outside oh okay alright so
we have that these things kind of
reminds me of the wii remotes and then
these cubes really the most
unprofessional review of anything ever
and it's because HTC didn't send this so
we're just kind of winging it um what do
we do with these we put it's like you
put them on the corners and it likes
like what's against right yeah way up
there yeah you have to put them on like
the high end dude shout out to the
padding are you kidding me Greg okay all
right you want to go and just plug these
into the there's some kind of wall
outlet somewhere yeah shout out to those
wall outlets that aren't here oh let me
excuse me Greg cuz i unplug these huge
lights that are taking all of the power
walk down like I bet you do so is this
all we have to do is just plug these in
we have to wire these to the headset too
I think it's a fun
I do know you have to plug in the blocks
though okay well obviously they're fine
okay perfect put one there and then put
one up here look at all those trophies
Greg yeah greg was really good at soccer
dude Amy's gonna be watching this video
be like he's trashing our headset I
promise I am handling with care all
right all right there we go got it yeah
yeah we're good and then i plug this bad
boy into whoops wrong one there there
all right oh it's like vibrating oh this
looks like it's gonna go good should I
move misty before she dies from like
impending doom hi so we gotta plan a
play area obviously we don't have much
room in here it's telling us we need two
million two meters by one-half meters or
six feet by 6 feet by 5 feet what did we
have three feet by three feet but what
ten feet so there should be a little box
and then the box yeah it's right here oh
and then you plug all of that into the
box and then the Box plugs into the
computer I think I'm Misty's for
sticking around for this okay so you're
sure we don't put anything else in these
vibrating cute I didn't say that I think
we do I just don't know why did we flip
into them I don't know because the
directions are very clear it just tells
me how to set it up once we have
everything plugged in let's connect a
big boy restarting seen VR it's a big
I'm not getting any picture that I know
oh you know what we have to like
it might not be plugged into the correct
port on my run room setter yeah what
does this mean this is right where does
it say could not start open the art
tools team your to hear that one looks
right yeah are you seeing uh oh yeah it
says you're seeing that stuff okay how
does it look shrimpy bro god I feel like
I just dropped LSD that's like a key in
front of me I don't know whether control
controllers oh there's one controller
there's one oh this is trippy really if
you can sense where your thumb is on the
pad in the game so look all right yeah
it's crazy so what is so trippy Greg
really oh my god that's cool it's like
it's the thing from Portal this here
wait turn a little to your right what no
I mean go back to where he is turn a
little off centered from them oh my get
him in the shot there you go this one's
like glitch in it okay there we go this
is so trippy whoa you have to put the
Hat earbuds in oh really yeah it's like
20 times better here I lost it I lost my
practice in the ground I know it's so
trippy this is I mean this is super
accurate yeah Oh balloons Charlie this
is the coolest thing so this is super
cool all right okay definitely we got to
try the game out I think the game's
gonna be so trippy serious sam is like
an intense game too okay so that's the
game we're gonna be playing wii there
there's actually a pretty decent
selection steam I grew up playing
serious sam as a kid like the original
one and you know it's kind of an old
school game that was really
cool with different guns you could use
and all the different creatures you were
fighting and they have a VR version of
that game which i think is perfect
because it can get fairly intense so
Miffy up whining can stop one you want I
think she does I wouldn't blame her it's
pretty awesome so yeah we're going to
bed and start up okay it gets me just
close that out right we wouldn't start
up serious sam and hopefully don't have
any problems I one thing I do want to
mention we had to swap the LG monitor
for the pics you monitor because this
monitor has a deed displayport a
displayport option and the HTC vive only
uses a mini displayport to displayport
from the box here or hdmi so the
graphics parts only have a single hdmi
output on them which means that if we
want to use the hdmi output on the vibe
box we have to use a monitor that does
not use hdmi the LG only offers hdmi
outputs so we have no choice but to do
that here okay Jacob so it looks like um
like you're good to go oh that what the
lasers are forced using the guys update
number six fix several issues with co-op
mode okay what's those missions join
game good game just play campaign
submissions yeah should i do serious
harder that would do normal serious is
gonna wreck you dude this is so crazy
they can sense where your fingers are on
the tap on so you just showed up in like
a desert is it pretty accurate yeah
actually really yeah I can only see it
really just do this is so crazy I feel
like I could I need to like duck and
roll just so you know you look totally
awesome dry like in real life oh do this
dude this is really great this is really
tricky oh this games hard hey these guys
running with the bombs man yeah it's
like multitask that's crazy that was
really hard
got a 137 credits Jake of you so oh yeah
I'm like standing on a galaxy you're
right feel like I'm on the grid it's so
sketchy oh dude if we had like a huge
warehouse and we could have run around
oh oh good luck dude o.o to who that
were difficult okay so we're gonna see
how accurate the just location sensors
are with the controllers Jacob has his
VR headset on and he's going to he's
gonna reach out and try on his first try
pick up both controllers I see that one
movie you see both of them just that one
up this benefit one is it right here
it's pretty good okay so as long as
they're within the field of view of
these little cubes of my corners these
are optical sensors i'm pretty sure so
they're fairly accurate yeah you like
that double action other great maybe
like this are you crossing hoping my
indiana jones oh okay dude this is so
ridiculously cool it's ridiculous it's
ridiculously cool it's so ridiculous
feel like Laura Croft and tomb raider
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
