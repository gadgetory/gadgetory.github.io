nope no more overclocking r9k intel
skylake CPUs what a letdown right
especially for those of us who purchase
any of these CPUs right here until us
fix this issue via a micro code update
that has now been included in every bios
of every motherboard that you could
possibly purchase on sites like Newegg
and amazon what this means is that if
you went out and purchased a z170
motherboard today you would likely have
a motherboard that included a BIOS that
featured this Intel micro code update
but what if we were able to downgrade
our BIOS to the older skylake
overclockable version there are plenty
of sites online that feature these old
BIOS updates they haven't been removed
since they've been posted so I'm
wondering can I actually downgrade my
motherboards BIOS to one that allows for
basically overclocking and be able to do
just that I'm going to give it a shot
and I'm going to use the pentium g 4400
as my guinea pig stay tuned the first
thing I had to do was hop online and
find the old BIOS update the
correspondent to my particular
motherboard I found it in the first
website I clicked and I went head and
gave it a download when the download was
finished I plugged in my USB thumb drive
and then simply extracted the BIOS
update into its folder it should be as
simple as that
I then restarted my computer and
prompted it into its BIOS via the delete
button from the home screen I clicked f8
which stands for cue flash and then I
found my BIOS update inside of my thumb
drives folder everything installed
correctly and I was prompted back into
my home screen everything looked pretty
good up to this point now what I had to
do was restart my computer again and
this time go into my newly downgraded
BIOS to see if I could actually face
clock overclock and the answer was yes I
could within the CPU frequency
controller tab I was very easily able to
change my base clock frequency from 102
basically whatever I wanted I change it
to where my actual CPU frequency was
just above 4 gigahertz
keep in mind that raising the base clock
frequency will also raise your memory
frequency so I don't recommend turning
on XMP profile especially if you have
RAM that's considerably fast around
3,000 megahertz or higher I also decided
to manually raise my voltage as well
from its standard 1.0 8 volts which I
think would
be under volting or CPU at a for bigger
frequency to 1.2 which i think is a safe
value for now i restarted the computer
after saving my settings within the bios
and boom the overclock stuck I confirmed
it via hardware monitor and the bios
itself after another simple restart
while my Geekbench scores were not
considerably higher my sentiment score
definitely was which I think would
contribute to a few extra fps in almost
any game you decide to play all other
things equal so what does this mean well
if you decide to purchase a z170
motherboard right now and a non K Intel
skylake CPU you can still actually base
clock overclock as long as you're okay
with the downgrading of BIOS if you're
comfortable with that things are looking
pretty good things could go south
however if Intel decides to push this
micro update via a Windows 10 update you
would almost assuredly experience a blue
screen of death if you were base clock
overclocking a non K CPU with that micro
code embedded into Windows 10 so to
prevent this I recommend googling how to
disable Windows 10 automatic updates and
also being familiar with how to
uninstall security updates that Windows
10 may have already installed in your
system in the background for now I do
recommend still purchasing non K CPUs
with the intent of overclocking them it
looks fairly safe as long as you are
comfortable with downgrading any BIOS
for any motherboard that you might be
purchasing in the near future if you
have any questions or concerns or
comments be sure to leave those in the
comments sections below if you think the
video deserved a thumbs up and go ahead
and give it one of those but if you
think we did a terrible job of
explaining things go ahead and give it a
thumbs down be sure to subscribe if you
haven't already and stay tuned for more
interesting technology-based videos
because that seems to be the in thing
right now and that's what we'll continue
to do this is science studio thanks for
learning with us
