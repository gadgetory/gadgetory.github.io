well clean ready to be made dirty very
soon I want to start off the video
though by talking about this work met
here this is something you can use you
can actually ground yourself if you want
to be super proper with PC building and
the like
but I took those off it issues this kind
of like as a building mat to protect the
finish on the wood underneath even
though this desk really isn't that
expensive but I have this mat link in
the description along with a few other
alternatives this one is from alpha cool
and it's pretty pricey so I recommend
getting something maybe a bit cheaper
than this that will do the same thing
this one was designed to do it's also
easy to cut down to size so it kind of
fits the shape of the desk now as for
today's video we've got to take a tour
to the closet here this is not only my
personal closet for clothes and whatnot
but also all of the tech gear that I've
kind of just stashed back here along
with two PC builds that I haven't yet
torn down so in this video we're going
to tear down the horizon 7 custom loop
PC build in this case right here this is
the fractal to find C sorry about the
weird autofocus and the dark it doesn't
do very well the too soon yeah too soon
so in every custom loop you've got three
primary components you've got your
radiators you've got your water blocks
for your graphics cards and/or CPU and
then you've got your reservoir somewhere
else in the case I recommend having a
reservoir pretty hard to fill your loop
if you didn't have one the trick to
draining a custom loop is to start with
your lowest common denominator and
that's figuratively speaking so I want
to drain from one of these two ports
because this is pretty much the lowest
point in the loop with the exception of
the pump which is down here this is
gonna really difficult to get out we're
gonna do some tilting and whatnot to get
the rest of the fluid out but if we turn
one of these dials here the fluid from
this run is going to fall out that's
expected but what we're going to have an
issue with is trying to get air to be
forced from the top of the loop down
through the loop to get the fluid out
the bottom right because if we have
everything sealed up top and the only
fluid that's going to leave the fluid
right here there's gonna be a lot of
pressure built up in the reservoir and
also in the block so to prevent a lot of
this fluid higher in the loop from
falling down we're gonna take out
anything that's not critical to the loop
we're going to take out all of the
cables that we can easily access
including the eight pin VGA cables and
we're also going to take out the 24 pin
anything related to the power supply we
went out first because if we do happen
to spawn a leak somewhere
we don't want our power supply getting
soaked by any means you know the last
time I clean this was the last time I
turn this PC on and dust still manages
to find its way in here this is kind of
the issue with semi much of the power
supplies the cables that you need will
have to be plugged into the power supply
but any extra cables just kind of have
to be hanging around and that's kind of
what I found myself running into here
also the pump is down below so any
excess cabling couldn't go down there so
it just kind of had to I don't know lay
it like this alright power supply is
removed now we're going to rotate it and
start draining the fluid now for those
wondering what the coolant composition
is I'm using some DI water and some true
opaque white this is just concentrated
premix here I added that to it I think
it's one of these for every gallon of
fluid don't quote me on that but very
simple procedure just dump it all in mix
it and you'll be fine now for the drain
because remember said we're gonna unplug
one of these two here probably this one
just because it runs to the CPU block
we're gonna uncap this we're going to
use a funnel one of these three funnels
pick and choose your poison and then we
gonna have it drained from the funnel
itself through one of these rubber tubes
to the bottle does I want to recycle
this stuff there's nothing wrong with
the fluid in there right now so we're
gonna reuse it in a future build now if
you got really fancy with your custom
loop or you know you just did it the
right way and included a drain valve
somewhere then you could just simply
screw this on to the other side of the
drain valve and then open it up and then
this could funnel into whatever you
wanted the fluid funnel into but for now
we're just gonna try it the
old-fashioned way we're gonna shove a
funnel right under here and just kind of
raw doggin let's see how much of it we
can catch in the bottle also in the
event of any leaks make sure to have
some kind of splash proof so and ready
to go yes this is Thomas the Train do
not judge me and just as another
precaution I'm gonna take a towel line
and lay inside here so don't have any
fluid finding its way into the crevices
of the case and we're gonna go ahead and
start draining now cap is
Oh
I'm actually working out pretty well
fluid is pretty much out of the graphics
card blocks for now that's a good thing
we're gonna go ahead and isolate the
rest of the loop here by taking these
out so these two pipes are going to be
kind of just hanging what I'm going to
do is take out this run to the CPU and
just cap it off with one of these G
quarter caps and then the only available
ICA's exit port for fluid is going to be
this pipe here I'm going to turn the PC
I guess this side down and this will be
where hopefully the remainder of the
fluid drains
check it out these fittings here from
premature literally warped the PE TG
tubing talk about a water tight fit
there's one 1080 and there is 210
eighties
isn't it weird how empty the case looks
without two graphics cards so you can
see we pretty much got the radiator
isolated the fluid up here at the top is
just kind of sitting so I expect the
fluid level to be somewhere around here
actually this is where the fluids
equalized at this point so the fluid and
the radiators probably around here
somewhere
and we can see that up in the back
there's no fluid so we're going to go
ahead and detach the radiator completely
and try our best to pull that out
although it is kind of wedged against
the pump and kinda moved around a little
bit and then the last two pieces to
remove the reservoir and the pump
all right and the last two things to
come out the reservoir and the CPU block
I can disconnect this without fluid
flying everywhere
all right and after about an hour or so
of cleaning all these parts I haven't
actually torn down the graphics card
block suppose some goo still in there
but tore down the CPU blog flushed the
radiator flushed the reservoir and make
sure the pump was nice and clean this is
kind of the end result here so I'm just
gonna package the stuff back up once it
dries and I will reuse it in a future
build so for those wondering what
happens to the custom loops when you
don't see them anymore video most of the
time this is what happens I tear them
down and I just recycle the parts and
now we have an empty case ready for the
next build so if you've enjoyed this
kind of like behind-the-scenes look at
what I do when I tear down PC sure let
me know by giving this video a thumbs up
I appreciate that thanks for stopping by
on this weekend of yours if you're
watching this when it was uploaded if
