megabytes of RAM 500 megabyte hard drive
built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a
modem that transmits at over 28,000 bps
Wow what are you gonna use it for games
and stuff it's laughable right I mean by
today's standards yeah definitely twelve
megabytes of RAM but Chandler was right
at this point in the show roughly
nineteen ninety-four what he had was
top-of-the-line the one he's sporting is
actually a Compaq
contour the twelve megabytes of RAM was
a special feature as was his unique
color display not the prettiest looking
thing but if you wanted a portable
computer back in the day you really had
no choice I mean check out those bezels
Wow
so 22 years later we have this what I
believe to be one of the most beautiful
laptops in existence not only for its
relative size nor almost bezel as
display but also its attention to the
finer details a carbon fiber finish on
the inside CNC machined aluminum front
and back panels sturdy hinge and
seamless trackpad it's not a perfect
laptop as you'll see here shortly but I
believe it's the closest anyone's ever
gotten meet the Dell XPS 13 let's begin
with a tour the top aluminum panel
reveals only a Dell logo an excellent
size in my opinion fits the form factor
the bottom much of the same to extended
rubber feet to prop it up a vent that
spans the entire contour and an XPS
labeled plate that can be lifted up to
reveal unique product information the
back sports nothing but a hinge and the
front reveals only a subdued white LED
when charging the right side reveals a
single USB 3.0 port with power share as
well as a full-size SD card reader and
the left another 3.0 port a charging
port a USB type-c Thunderbolt 3 port a
headphone microphone jack and an LED
battery notification hub opening the
laptop we find a chiclet keyboard with
well spaced keys but that aren't
necessarily the biggest I wish they were
slightly bigger than they already are
roughly 1.3 millimeters of key travel
still a huge improvement from my 12 inch
macbook mind you they're a bit mushy not
as tactile as I'd like but nothing to
pout over their LED backlit adjustable
via the f10 key these are dead
gated switches by the way so no function
but needed I'm glad to see that Dell
didn't compromise on the shift-key
extension look I know it doesn't sound
like a big deal to those of you who only
use the left shift key but try only
using the right one from now on and
you'll see exactly where I'm coming from
with the yoga 910 to the right of the
keyboard you'll find a power button with
a slight linear illumination nothing
overkill glad to see it followed by one
other piece of important hardware worth
mentioning down below the trackpad it's
not as smooth as my Mac books nor as
responsive but it's still pretty darn
good to finger scrolling is cake if
calibrated correctly tap clicking can be
done anywhere and the left and right
physical clicks are prudent yet defined
now let's talk about the XPS lineup
hallmark the screen if the form factor
alone doesn't reveal how far we've come
in just a couple of decades this
infinity display surely does what you're
looking at is a 13.3 inch edge to edge
glossy EXO IPS panel capable of insane
viewing angles and fairly accurate color
reproduction with minor calibration this
here is the stock calibration what you'd
get out of the box in terms of color
reproduction at 3200 by 1800 pixels at
most a higher PPI density than Apple's
own MacBook Pro retina models 276 PPI
versus 226 and while not as accurate on
the Adobe RGB spectrum as the Apple
counterpart this variant of the XPS
sports a touchscreen this display is
also fairly bright approaching 400 nits
of brightness compared to 300 to 350
from its closest competitors it varies
from model to model and even unit to
unit although nowhere near the
brightness of the MacBook at roughly 500
and now the infamous trademark of the
XPS lineup introducing the chin cam how
lovely you won't look great from really
any angle and there's really no fix for
that here seeing as though it isn't a 2
in 1 laptop but I'd rather have this
gorgeous display than a gorgeous camera
angle just my personal preference at
720p 30fps it's nothing to brag about
but at least it's not 12-inch MacBook
quality yeah I went there
now let's discuss internals I bought
this one fully loaded cable a core i7
7500 u 16 gigabytes of RAM 512 gigabyte
solid state drive and of course the qhd+
display you can purchase much cheaper
variants of this laptop one sporting a
1080p matte screen for example
or core i3 or Core i5 counterpart and
smaller storage increments as low as 128
gigabytes the cheapest combination will
run you around eight hundred US dollars
although I recommend at least opting for
Core i5 if you're going to buy an XPS 13
while this model here is more in the
ballpark of about $1,500 the only thing
I could have still upgraded potentially
was the SSD Dell does offer a one
terabyte version but it's nothing I'm
willing to drop an extra 200 bucks on at
this point storage and the Wi-Fi card
are both swappable by the way in this
laptop although I'm not sure why you'd
want to replace the killer 1535 wireless
AC card from Qualcomm it's already
plenty fast as it is speakers are
moderately tinny typical of most
ultrabooks
although I will admit I was a bit
spoiled by my 12 inch macbook the
speakers were so good there are two side
firing speakers on the XPS 13 that are
decent up to about 50% distortion takes
over past that base is relatively
inaudible here's a sound comparison
between my 12 inch MacBook and the XPS
13
lastly I'd like to discuss battery life
it's a flaky subject mainly because it
varies from user to user as well as
model to model I consider myself a power
user I usually have a few chrome tabs
open as well as Pandora and Microsoft
Office a few other programs running in
the background so the laptops not just
sitting idle or streaming something like
Netflix I managed to get about seven to
seven and a half hours of battery life
at 50% screen brightness 50 not 15
so half brightness that's still plenty
doable it's not too dim you know it's
not like some screens at 50% brightness
sometimes you can't actually enjoy the
screen but here at 50% it actually looks
you know like some other screens at 75
to 80% at 100% constant brightness
expect that figure to fall near five
hours Netflix and other video streaming
though thanks to advancements in KB Lake
architecture can yield times near 9 to
10 hours it really all depends on what
you're doing but in general I'd give it
a solid 8 out of 10 in the battery life
Department that's a solid 8 out of 10
most cases it's around 6 to 7 so I'm
glad to see that battery life wasn't
compromised here
not exactly a 12-inch MacBook or even
MacBook Pro in this regard but then
again we're packing twice the power of a
12-inch MacBook into a form factor that
really isn't much different so if you're
wondering why I ditched the yoga 910 for
this and decided to just do a review on
this one instead there are two reasons
the first is the terribly placed short
shift key on the right if you think
that's stupid would ever bite me and the
second is the fan noise the yoga was so
loud and so abrupt I'd be typing
something like a word document with no
background tasks running no Windows 10
updates ensuing none of that I checked
task manager consistently and I'd hear
the turbo spool that's what I call it
turbo spool very high pitched not sure
what was causing the CPU to get so hot
but the XPS is experienced none of that
and keep in mind both of these laptops
were sporting the exact same internals
when the fan does kick on the XPS 13 its
subdued and infrequent something I
expect from an ultra-low power laptop
I'll be uploading both synthetic and
gaming benchmarks of this machine in the
coming days as well as a video editing
rendering showdown between this and the
12-inch MacBook for now I need to edit
this video quickly
back and beyond my way home to Florida
tomorrow what time is it 357 am I really
need a hobby anyway that's where I'll
see you shortly
you know the routine thumbs up thumbs
