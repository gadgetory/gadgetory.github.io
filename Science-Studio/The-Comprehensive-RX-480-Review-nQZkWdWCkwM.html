for the rx4 ad all lined up ready to go
but as I was writing I realized you
people don't care about that
you want the benchmarks the thermals the
sound test the form factor the scaling
performance the frame rates and guess
what I have all of that I fed the rx4 ad
for a few weeks now and the opportunity
to run extensive tests on the card using
my own personal rig and it has
indefinitely removed the most any CPU
bottleneck in existence for any game out
there I've got a core i7 6700 K
overclock to 4.6 gigahertz 16 gigabytes
in to 8 gigabyte variants of yield super
loose ddr4 clock to 3,000 megahertz and
an ACC 178 motherboard beyond that I of
course have the R X 480 here this one is
the 8 gigabyte variant which is great
because it not only eliminates any
potential memory bottleneck and
crossfire especially but also because it
ensures that we can push these cards to
their maxes on individual levels for
instance when I was benchmarking GTA 5
with this card I had everything maxed
out including Advanced Settings in 1080p
and I was exceeding the 4 gigabyte
threshold and indeed according to MSI
Afterburner I was exceeding that level
of erm allocation during the benchmark
having the extra 4 gigabytes allows us
to focus just on the GPU which is
ultimately what this video will focus on
I should also note this reference card
will be kept as stock frequencies for
these tests you're about to see all of a
separate video detailing the
overclocking benefits of the rx 480 if
it's not already in the card right here
stay tuned for that one so thanks to
Samsung and Global Foundries 14 animated
FinFET technology we've got a powerful
graphics card that runs off of just one
single 6 pin power connector imagine
that the card is slim measuring just
over 23 centimeters in length three and
a half centimeters in height and 9
centimeters when inserted into the
motherboard making it a perfect fit for
any ATX or micro ATX build the actual
PCB is much shorter in length so if you
decided to water coolest puppy you're
looking at a circuit board length of
about 17 and a half centimeters and with
this style of cooler strap on board
you're probably wondering what are the
temperatures like well after running
Heaven benchmark for 30 minutes straight
at max 1080p settings the our X 480 only
peaked at 78 degrees Celsius making it
much cooler than the reference r9 390
and actually even cooler than nvidia
zone GTX 970 after the same 30 minute
period the blower style cooler equipped
with the rx 480 is actually pleasant to
the ear not indicative of the classic r9
290 leaf blower a few years back have a
listen to different distances from
Cardwell under load
I would let you listen to audio at idle
but there isn't any because the cards of
dead silent even at a crispy 39 degrees
Celsius in fact you don't start hearing
much of anything at all until past 60
degrees Celsius when the fans speed up
to a couple thousand rpm the same fan
speed in a reference to 90 would
honestly have you convinced that your
neighbor was mowing his lawn so big
improvement on the color design all
around and now the moment you've all
been waiting for the entree the main
course the number one with a large fry
okay
I'm gonna stop now here are the gaming
benchmarks let's start off first with 3d
mark firestrike where we find our RX 40
creeping in nice and snug between the
gtx 970 and r9 390 and keep in mind for
about 100 US dollars less than both so
know right off the bat the RX 480 is not
on par with the GTX 980 as many of you
assumed at least at stock speeds but
that's for another video
heaven benchmark yields much of the same
the RX 40 doesn't stand out on its own
but again considering the fact that this
card is about the same price of the GTX
960 we're pulling ample performance from
this thing let's hop into GTA 5 this
game's a great blend of both CPU and GPU
intensive segments and unsurprisingly we
find the 480 keeping up with both the r9
390 and GTX 970 across-the-board the
maximums and minimums were a bit lower
for the 480 but a decent overclock
should correct these issues and given
the thermal Headroom of this card we've
got plenty of frequency to play with
bumping up the resolution and dialing
down a few settings evens out the
playing field and the scenario all three
cards are relatively even making the RX
40 a great candidate for 1440p gaming
with grand theft auto and hitman 1080p
is a piece of cake in fact in this
instance we find the 480 overtaking the
390 a card which this game was bundled
with at one time the same goes for
DirectX 12 not much changes for the 480
but the minimums of both the older
generation if accan amount and in case
you're wondering bumping the resolution
doesn't change the fact that the 40
still takes the cake for a game like
City skylines the CPU picks up a lot of
the slack especially when zoomed in
super close here for reasons unknown the
RX 480 struggles in fact this is one of
the only games in our list where the RX
40 doesn't keep up with or surpass the
other two the average ended up at just
under 73 20 frames below the 390 and 30
frames below the 970 again overclocking
the 480 could change things but for now
I'm leaving things at stock because
believe it or not people will purchase
their for ATS and just throw them into
their rigs and not tweak with anything
and just start playing games so that's
why these are the stock
frequency's i have a separate video for
the overclock frequencies that's coming
very soon if it's not already up
total war Warhammer from a series also
known for its CPU intensive tendencies
reveals a very good story in this case
the RX 4 ad keeping up with it's more
expensive competitors our averages for
both the 480 and 970 were within the
margin of error and our framerate dips
remained on par with each other as well
last on this list is rise of the Tomb
Raider I have saved this one for last
because well the game isn't entirely
optimized yet it was at one time bundled
with the GTX 970 making this test
undeniably a bit biased but bear with me
there's a reason I've included this one
the 970 is the clear winner across the
board 95% for the averages and twice the
minimum frame rates
enough said however running things in
DirectX 12 mode changes things a bit
maybe not for the averages I mean it's
fairly obviously the 970 is still
dominating this game but for the
minimums the RX 480 and 390 for that
matter I would perform the Nvidia
counterpart this sheds a bit of light
into the current situation of all in
DirectX 12 and the 2 graphics card
developers thanks to hardware based
asynchronous compute and better DirectX
12 Driver optimization the red team
still holds on at least for the minimums
in a game design with the opposing team
in mind don't believe me and have a look
at 1440p DirectX 12 performance here the
RX 480 is actually the winner with an
average frame rate of just over 48 new
york's phoria performs even the GTX 970
in a game it wasn't even designed around
I wanted to do something a little
different for this last benchmark I'm
about to show you involving ashes of the
singularity this game super savviness
benchmarking techniques here we have
both the gtx 980ti n gtx 1070 where the
980ti just barely takes the cake if you
missed that video on our channel go
ahead and click the card right here
guess what I'm about to do I'm gonna
throw the R X 480 into this mix seems a
little unfair right just just bear with
me you're gonna you'll see it's not as
bad as you think there that's it
honestly not bad at all
at all this card is less than half the
price of either of these cards currently
well in most cases and I can't complain
about its performance here yeah I just
can't when I cross fire two of these
then we'll see who really is the king of
the $400 Club I invite you to check out
some of our older videos if you're new
to the channel click the subscribe
button if you haven't already and give
this video a like if you thought it was
cool give it a dislike if you didn't
think it was cool or if you just hate
everything about life and stay tuned for
the overclocking benchmarks of the 480
and
we're cheap AMD build feature in the 480
as well I'm talking under 400 bucks and
I'm gonna throw that card into that
build should be very interesting folks
this is science studio thanks for
