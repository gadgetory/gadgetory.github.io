I just woke up that's because I just
woke up it's early Saturday morning and
time to build a PC actually two pcs but
in this video only one of the two
because I still have a few more parts to
get for the second one so the theme here
we're gonna build two pcs and they're
gonna be black and white one will be a
mostly white theme and one will be a
mostly black theme and we're going to
use rise in three processors to keep the
price low because we've been to a lot of
expensive builds lately so horizon 3 it
is I've also got two pretty cheap
graphics cards that you should check out
if you want to build a budget oriented
PC like we're gonna do in this video
let's see which of these is the r3 1300
execute not that one which means it has
to be this one okay we're also gonna
need one of these and we're gonna need
this
okay now Ram RAM RAM RAM RAM RAM there
we go up top okay so we have some lpx
pretty cheap black Ram here's a gig kit
eight gigs gonna be pretty bare-bones
but that's what we're going for here
Vera bones rise and rig and we have some
really nice Vengeance RGB white RAM from
course they're saving that for the white
theme we're gonna go with the cheap
stuff here for the black build alright
now for our coolers for the white rig
Rene's captain 240 X white RGB cooler so
I wasn't pointing the camera in the
right direction and for the black theme
builder to use the same cooler but in
the black variant so this is the captain
240 X art whoops RGB black edition now
another compromise in this budget build
PC will be a one terabyte hard drive
only this is the only thing we're gonna
use now this is not gonna hurt our
gaming performance it's important that
you know that this will only slow down
gaming load times your operating system
will take a bit longer to load for
things to kind of refresh and whatnot if
you're used to SSDs going back to just a
hard drive is pretty painful but a lot
of people are still in a hard drive so
yeah they're not bad
it just it I guess that takes a little
longer for things to load up sometimes
so these are the parts we're using we
have an MSI motherboard wd1 tera hard
drive of course their vengeance lpx ram
we have a GTX excuse me miss ogyny TX
and RX 570 horizon 3 1300 and then we
have a deep cool captain 240 X RGB
cooler which isn't pretty cuz it's
outside of the box but it'll look really
pretty when we have it all set up and
lastly we need we need a case we need a
case case
keys keys oh yeah we're gonna use a dark
bass 700 like I promised in that review
video could check it out right here by
the way if you haven't already this is a
great case the great modular case pretty
big for a mid Tower but it should look
sweet with all of our black theme
components one component I forgot to
mention this cooler master a power
supply here I think this is a 650 watt
so v6 50 will be using that's more than
enough power for this system this system
will practically sip on power we also
have modular cables over there and
they're all black colored they're not
like nasty ketchup mustard cable colors
so all of that's gonna fit in here now I
understand that this case from be quiet
is not cheap sorry about the autofocus
so that's the one thing that I'm kind of
splurging on but I do want to build in
it I'm on an excuse to build in it so if
you want to build a PC similar this I
suggest picking a much cheaper case that
it kind of falls in line with the rest
of the components on a price level
so this is the point in the video where
I usually talk about specifications
maybe how powerful the PC is run some
benchmarks we'll get to that shortly but
I want to preface the ending of this
video by saying first and foremost that
the dark bass 700 was not selected
because it was a budget case in fact
that's $180 case it's pretty expensive I
don't expect you to put a six or $700 PC
into a case that expensive your case
should be maybe a tenth of your PCs
total cost I wouldn't go any higher than
that unless you're like purely an
aesthetics person instead I chose that
case because I promised in that review
video that it would be building in it so
here you go there's that build video
also I've linked a cheaper case apart
from the DB 700 you can find that link
below also a cheaper case the Fant XP
300 that's a tempered glass case it
comes in at 60 bucks with RGB accents
not too big but should should suit most
cheap builds nicely it's gonna look more
expensive than it actually is and 60
bucks is about all I would spend on
maybe a sub 600 $700 PC all of the
pooris I should mention are linked below
if you want to build a PC similar to
this and I've got to say I said this on
Twitter earlier I'm really surprised
with the performance of this PC I
thought that the r3 would fall short of
you know like a typical quad core from
Intel I mean it's not an Intel CPU but
Rison 3 does offer 4 physical cores you
don't have multi-threading support but
it's still nice to have 4 solid cores
not multi threading on a dual core
processor which would not be as good for
games more on hyper threading this video
right here but the rise on 3 1300 X it's
a really really nice bang for the buck
seed peeve I was on a tight budget maybe
$600 this is exactly what I'd go for you
could make a case for the r3 1200 just
because of the 1213 our decks are really
the same processor once just clocked a
bit higher slightly better bin but you
should get similar overclocks with both
so I would say that if the r3 1200 was
maybe 10 bucks cheaper than the r3 1300
just get the 1200 I mean it's it's 10
bucks save that 10 bucks or buy a nicer
CPU cool or something you'll get decent
overclocks with both the rx 570 by the
way it's a four gig variant I bought it
at Best Buy for Black Friday it's
actually a pretty sweet card for the
price I paid about 220 bucks for it
which is much better than what they were
going for an ebay about six months or so
thanks to the mining craze so I'd say
that 220 bucks is fair for now in this
current market and being that it was a
Black Friday sale I can't really say how
long this deal will
but you do have a local Best Buy or
something along those lines you can
purchase one for a really sweet price
over there right now it only uses one 8
pin power cable and it's pretty quiet
save the the coil line coil ends pretty
bad have a listen
so yeah not the quietest in that respect
I will save yet maybe a gammy headset or
sound damping foam in your case then you
should be alright you're not gonna want
to return the car because it's that loud
it's really not it's just noticeable if
you maybe have the left side panel off
or if you're just using some surround
sound speakers
now speaking of performance the RX 570
will not disappoint even with its four
gigs of vram and even when paired with a
quad-core horizon 3 cpu we were pushing
around 60 to 70 FPS in pub G in the
1080p resolution with the high preset
enabled which i would say is a pretty
liberal preset for a bill that's this
cheap it handled it admirably things
were very smooth I didn't see any frame
dips now for comparison's sake my
personal record some behind me is
sporting to 1080 s in SLI and also an i7
8700 K and twice the system ram mind you
and I'm only getting around 130 fps with
this rig so you know pub G's not a very
optimized game at this point I'm pretty
sure it's still in beta right and that's
why it's always crashing but there is
something to be said about the value
proposition of this this build here
because this builds only gonna cost
around six or seven hundred bucks my
build costs just in parts alone without
water cooling care about twenty to
twenty three hundred bucks so yeah
you're getting maybe half the
performance for considerably less than
half the price but anyway I hope you
enjoy the build I hope you like the way
it looks I hope you like the way it
performs as well I am really impressed
with how great this PC handles some
pretty intensive and not well optimized
games like pub G I also decided to test
universe and box 2 just to see you know
what it would take to make the rise and
three CPU crap itself
I ran the earth and manymoon simulation
in 1080p with the ultra preset enabled
to kind of alleviate the CPU stress just
a bit because it's a very CPU intensive
in this particular simulation and yeah
we experienced a few frame stutters a
few skips altogether my personal rate
did not obviously I would expect it not
to especially in this resolution but no
it's not bad in fact I would say it's
pretty good for a hundred dollar CPU so
again if you want to build a similar PC
I strongly encourage you to check this
video's description to find a bunch of
links to Amazon and Newegg for all the
parts you've seen in this video also
some cheaper alternatives especially for
the case and the cooler if you want to
swap those for some cheaper alternatives
that makes perfect sense in a budget
build anyway if you like this video
maybe like the bill be sure
give this video a thumbs up I do
appreciate that thumbs down for the
opposite or if you hate everything in my
life don't be shy
