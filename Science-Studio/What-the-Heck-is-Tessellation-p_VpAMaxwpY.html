games and benchmarks that looks like
this or this labelled tessellation what
does it mean and will it crush your
framerate this is minute signs so you
can think of tessellation as the literal
division of polygons that comprise
objects that we see in games and other
special effects the more divided the
surface is the more detailed and
accurate quote-unquote the surface will
be depicted in game if an object is
graphically depicted via several
triangles then cutting each triangle in
half essentially doubles the
tessellation factor but this alone I
should clarify really changes nothing
just because you add more polygons to an
object that does not mean that it's
going to look any more dynamic in fact
if you don't do anything but tessellate
an object you're just adding more work
for the GPU doubling the number of
shapes changes nothing if half the
shapes are physically unaltered from the
original ones this 2d representation
explains it a bit better just picture it
on a 3d scale so the backdoor process
often paired with tessellation called
displacement mapping shifts and angles
these newly created shapes NVIDIA
describes it as a texture that stores
height information an image that would
otherwise look either blocky without
tessellation or unrealistically smooth
with tessellation but without
displacement mapping now looks well
accurate typically a tessellation toggle
includes a degree of this displacement
built-in you see back in the day
traditional texture mapping involved a
degree of occlusion explained in this
video right here also women in science
video in a nutshell certain pixels are
shaded in an attempt to fool the viewer
into thinking that the shape is more
dynamic than it actually is it adds a
degree of artificial depth if you will
this middle image of shape is consistent
with the original one on the left
but incorporated shadows foster the
illusion of depth so it looks like it's
rough but it's actually just as smooth
as the one to the left now the image on
the right
utilizes displacement mapping which
obviously yields an accurate shape
regardless of the viewing angle
simply put tessellation without
displacement mapping would not change
anything about the object and
displacement mapping without
tessellation would make the object look
extremely blocky so both are needed to a
degree
three four games to look real in some
cases like GTA 5 polygons are already
incorporating large degrees of detail so
increasing tessellation changes next to
nothing in fact you'd be hard-pressed in
this comparison to tell which is which
this is what tessellation maxed out and
this is what it turned off the framerate
delta is also relatively minuscule other
scenarios however including the heaven
benchmark from Unigine offers stark
tessellation contrast between maxed and
off presets check out these stairs I
think they're just smooth ramps now not
even stairs anymore the dragon also
looks completely different so depending
on how the game is developed
tessellation may be one of the things
you can manipulate to drastically impact
its look and feel most of the time
maxing it out won't hurt much but
running a framerate comparison like
either of these might shed a bit more
insight into GPU utilization I'd like to
thank one of our patrons for suggesting
the topic in today's minutes science
video if you'd like to be a patron
contribute in any way shape or form more
active get personal contacts with me and
others who work with me on discord
servers on whatsapp chats all kinds of
stuff you want to play games with me
patriotic okcousin matter how much or
little you donate if you do donate a bit
more you get access to a few additional
features even our upcoming science
studio t-shirts all that stuff is
available will be available if it's not
already on the patreon link so check it
out in the description below also get
active on other stuff from social media
I appreciate y'all watching this video
give a thumbs up he thought it was cool
thumbs down for the obstacles described
but if you have our news stay tuned for
more content like this
this is science studio thanks for
learning with us
