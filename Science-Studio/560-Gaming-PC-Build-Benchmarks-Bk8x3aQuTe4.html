build log will take place in this video
today the total price coming in at
around 560 USD so if you're interested
in a budget oriented system this video
might be for you now I have some older
hardware like the GTX 760 I purchased
from a fellow patreon actually for about
60 bucks and then we have a rising 3
1200 processor comes in around $90
that's new they have an asrock a be 350
gaming 4 that's about a hundred bucks or
so we have an older corsair power supply
the RM 750 X with some used red sleeve
cables we have 8 gigs of T force ddr4
from Team Group this comes in about a
hundred bucks
and of course we want to upgrade that
later to 16 but for now eight and a
budget system is just fine
oh yeah the big case back there this is
actually from air oh cool this is what
they call the cylon it comes in two
about 50 to 60 bucks certainly nothing
too fancy it is a budget oriented case
and that's why it's in this video but it
does still have some quality features
like RGB accents up front you can
control with a dedicated switch up here
you even get look at this an acid II
card reader both a full sized MIDI card
as well as a micro SD card reader built
into the system you have a power button
reset switch all the goodies up top and
yeah I mean it's pretty bare-bones in
there but that's of course what you get
when you buy a cheap case like this most
of the time
no tempered glass we do have an acrylic
side panel though so we can see our
goodies inside speaking of which let's
go ahead and start throwing things in
here and then we'll get to benchmarking
and see just how well this system
performs
so I was pleasantly surprised by how
well this PC performed given its price
tag and how old the graphics card is the
four gig buffer and the 7/16 definitely
came through a lot us to pump in game
settings just a bit more than we
otherwise would have been able to and my
target was around 60 FPS so if you games
fell short of that and a few games
surpassed that you know by quite a bit
it really depends on the title and I try
to keep those in game settings as
consistent as possible with my previous
benchmark so if you want to go back and
look at those and see how my previous
builds compared to this one you're more
than welcome to do that I'll link a few
those videos down below the first game I
tested was play around owns
battlegrounds this one's by far the most
popular out there on the PC side of
things and believe it or not people are
actually building pcs strictly for pub G
gaming so I wanted to test this one
first
see if it hit the mark or not and across
the board I had settings set to medium
except for foliage which is set to very
low and then view distance set to very
high and my average frame rate for this
build came out to 50 fps I was actually
pretty impressed with that that's not
bad for a 1080p resolution which is
pretty common that dropped to 40 FPS for
the lowest one percent of frames and a
29 for the lowest point one percent of
frames so we're still staying above 30
fps or right at 30 fps for even the
worst case scenario which I would deem
playable still I mean that's gonna be
better than what you're gonna see on
consoles for the most part and at 50 FPS
for the average still really good
considering we have our settings in game
at you know pretty modest presets I
would say medium is a pretty fair
comparison because it's it's gonna be a
run-of-the-mill setting that most people
would use in game
GT five and rise of the Tomb Raider
performed in a similar fashion to pub G
which I was fairly impressed with that
means the pub she's come a long way from
an optimization standpoint city skylines
the universe sandbox two or the worst
performers but these are very CPU
intensive so our Rison three 1200 CP
here was choked quite a bit witcher 3
was by far almost graphics intensive
game so that's where the 764 gig model
becomes our bottleneck and the best
performer overall was doom but this game
is just excellent in OpenGL in a general
sense these framerate trends are fairly
impressive we have what a 2 gen old
Nvidia card in here it's not even a very
powerful one I mean think about it like
the 960 right from Maxwell was it was
good enough for 1080p and it was really
about if you went 1440p territory type a
really dumb down settings that 760 was a
right our worst performer than the 960
was just as a progression and the 760
here is doing very well this for Giga
buffer I'm really glad we opted for that
again just because we can bump in game
settings where applicable like with doom
I was testing this in the ultra preset
and we were using around 4 gigs of VRAM
there GTA 5 we also bordered on 4 gigs
of ram so if you're looking for a used
card which I recommend in this hostile
market for graphics cards in particular
I recommend at least 4 gigs of memory
because more demanding games are
released every day and you're gonna be
using more that memory buffer despite
having to dumb down some settings just
in general even with the low presets
you might still be using close to 4 gigs
of ram so it's more or less becoming the
minimum I would say in 2018 kind of want
to call this one the sleeper build
because if you just look at it from the
outside it doesn't look too impressive
although I do like the color
coordination we've got going on inside
but if you look at the price tag right 5
600 USD you're gonna think ok well this
thing's gonna barely push out 1080p
games and some pretty low in game
settings but it actually does fairly
well considering how much we spent on
the graphics card for 160 bucks I'll
admit that's a bit low for the you know
the typical asking price for a 760
especially the 4 gig model but if you
can find a deal like that maybe got a
friend who has an old car that he's not
using anymore you can maybe pitch them
you know 50 bucks 100 bucks or if it's a
good one then that's something that will
get you your foot in the door right - PC
gaming you want to spend a ton of money
on inflated graphics cards now as usual
you can find global links to all the
parts used in this build in the video
description I've
also tied a few eBay listings in there
for graphics cards in particular because
I recommend buying used right now in
today's market unless you buy a prebuilt
or something that already comes packaged
with the graphics card that's about the
only time you'll really get a discount
on those or a discount off of the
inflated MSRP I guess I should say
similar graphics cards for the red team
would consist of maybe like the r7 three
sixty or seventy three seventy the r9
280 you get my drift light the cards
that were brand new maybe 200 bucks or
so that are right now still around 200
bucks or so because people are asking
outrageous sums of cash for them because
they are selling at that price thanks to
mining but if you want to spend around
that much money and get a card like that
they'll certainly save a lot of money
especially if you don't want to spend
you know $800 on a gtx 1070 which would
be a really good bang for the buck
graphics card in today's market that
just doesn't exist so until those prices
drop you use this away to go again
around r7 370 territory for the AMD side
and then something like a GTX 760 maybe
a 960 or 970 from Nvidia would be a
great entry-level graphics card from
Nvidia side if that if you liked this
video be sure let me know again some on
a thumbs up I appreciate a thumbs down
for the optically subscribe but if you
have it already stay tuned for more
content like this this is science studio
thanks for building with us
