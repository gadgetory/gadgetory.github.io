reality is the future of gaming it's
incredibly immersive already and doesn't
require you to move around a lot
although moving around a lot it's the
best part in my opinion and you have the
freedom to do so with the art you see
computer games of old are too stagnant
first-person shooters for example
require the movement of only three body
parts your arms your fingers and your
eyes that's it so while many of us risk
of DVT blood clots and carpal tunnel
from a mouse and keyboard VR encourages
the user to get up and move so their
positive attributes apart from just
being a new experience physically for
your body part of the reason VR is so
immersive that you can move around a lot
and to demonstrate just how immersive it
can be we've partnered with oculus to
showcase the new ribbed s let's talk
about some of the hardware associated
with rift s one thing you'll likely
notice out of the box immediately is the
lack of external sensors VR kits have
old required standalone sensors that
tracked head and handset motion in order
to keep everything in sync and
synchronization is extremely important
in the arts one of the reasons why it
feels real the original oculus rift
required at least two external sensors
three for a full sized room and they can
admittedly be a pain to wire up and
calibrate with rift s however this is
the number of external sensors you'll
need zero and that's because oculus
instead integrated sensors five of them
actually all around the headset through
what they call the insight system so
check this out and yes you can wear
glasses with this headset yeah but one
optical sensor to the right one to the
left two up front and one up top so if I
happen to be playing VR I'm not but if
you do make sure you wear the wrist
straps you don't like these things
flying into your TV or someone else you
can see that the headset can track
movement of these controllers pretty
much anywhere I can stretch my hands and
that's very important it sounds a bit
crazy I'll give you that but on paper it
makes perfect sense you see VR is all
about movement it's about feeling like
you're somewhere else entirely and fixed
external sensors limit this players
movement and are prone to interference
from things in your immediate
surroundings so if I for example was to
step between a sensor and another player
tracking would be thrown all out of
whack button with rift s no such
interference occurs it's literally all
done through the headset
and the two handsets it's pretty awesome
actually and it works really well in the
real world it's actually more reliable
in our experience and significantly
easier to set up
thanks to fewer wires and calibration
steps next let's talk about the oculus
store which boasts a surplus of
top-of-the-line VR content curtailed
specifically toward rift and rift s you
can find instant classics like beat
saver which McLovin instantly fell in
love with you just need to sync up your
saber slashing with the rhythm of the
song in question but that's you know
sounds what you see er than it is the
colors and this one are fantastic though
I'm getting a futuristic retro kind of
vibe and it doesn't just stop there you
can of course play VR titles on Steam as
well and the good thing about opting for
an established brand like oculus is that
a vast majority of the our titles
support rift as natively you know our
favorites here is a game called stand
out think pub chi but completely
hands-on you literally run around the
map in a battle royale format search for
guns load up ammo the gun and shoot
just like you would in pub G or
fortnight except in this case you're
completely immersed in the experience
you're doing all of the same motions you
would in real life so it feels of course
more real you can even crouch and go
prone assuming you have enough space
just make sure you're always wearing the
handset straps around your wrist you
don't again want to be smashing your TV
or someone else in the face another cool
attribute of rift s is its integrated
positional audio part of the immersion
factor that I keep coming back to is
sound you can have a picture that makes
you question your own reality but
without sound
it lacks structure in order for humans
to be convinced of something every sense
must be satisfied so you've got a few
options here and I always welcome
options for the consumer 1 connect your
own headphones they don't even have to
be oculus branded any pair will do it's
just a three and a half millimeter
headphone jack but your second option is
using rift ass's built-in speakers they
wrap around either side of your head and
have directional firing for a surround
sound sort of feel consider stand out
for example hearing footsteps and
gunfire is critical year and rift acid
does such a good job of simulating
direction that I haven't found a need
for an external pair of headphones and
that's awesome look if you want to use a
thousand dollar set of cans be my guest
the fact is you have a choice but if
your headset is nothing without comfort
so here's the Ross
you're at 1280 by 1440 pixels per eye
now for a theoretical 1440p full screen
experience when viewing with both eyes
this is also a 80 Hertz display down
from a 90 Hertz in the original rift I
don't see flickering so it's not an
issue for me but you might so I suggest
test driving one at your local big-box
retailer if you think it's a concern
though it's probably not one these two
metrics appear more is like side grades
than anything else I'll admit there's no
two ways about it but a trade-off and
upside here is that minimum PC
requirements remain unchanged from the
original rift
despite some noteworthy upgrades
including the lack of external sensors
and one thing oculus is definitely proud
of in the visuals Department is an
improved lens array reducing the overall
screen door effect that plate older
generation VR headsets it's a huge step
in the right direction and definitely
relieves the strain on the eyes after
long gaming sessions
additionally oculus improved its halo
headband for rift X allowing for more
flexibility and comfort regardless of
head size or shape and I have a really
weird shaped head so that's important
plush padding up front and at the rear
helps a ton the strap up top helps align
the screen with your eyes which is
important and the twistable fastener it
back secures everything in place for
security and even the most intense
situations so check this out
I'll go ahead and slip this thing on
with my glasses twist that fastener at
the rear and let's just start shaking
your head there's literally no moment
you hear my glasses good my glasses
aren't fixed to my face but this headset
ain't going anywhere folks and that's a
good thing because some of these games
are gonna make you oh you just you do
you ever know it's it's it's that
immersive it feels like you're actually
being attacked by things so be careful
ah it's like Captain Jack Sparrow of an
arrow gosh man me me Oh a little mix-up
action you get that grace all right I
got half of it a little bit of samurai
action up here
oh I'm getting really hot and sweaty oh
so well I definitely admit that it gives
me a pretty good workout I mean I really
am still sweating it's a lot of fun I'm
gonna buy one for me my girlfriend to
play I think it's fun to having a little
studio apartments that you can get down
and you have some room to move around
yeah so like here's the deal without a
doubt
riff des is an incremental upgrade over
the original rift it's just an S model
by the way it's not rift - but oculus
has managed to pack all of these
features and upgrades into a kit that
only costs 399 us I think the biggest
improvement was sensor integration
without a doubt this was by far the
easiest PC VR headset I've set up to
date and I only expect it to get better
with oculus from here on out and I'm
still waiting for you know like wireless
hdmi like integrated battery pack
totally untethered VR that would be
awesome to have the power of a PC behind
you and yeah if you're interested in
something like that totally untethered
they do have quest which has its own
like built-in set of games and runs off
of a snapdragon 835 it's less powerful
but it's totally untethered so there's
that option as well oculus is doing cool
things and I'm excited to see where they
go from here so yeah keyboard and mouse
gaming just isn't the same after gaming
with rip desks for several weeks it's
all about immersion I keep saying that
but that's the point of VR and again I'm
excited to see where oculus goes from
here thank you all for watching
