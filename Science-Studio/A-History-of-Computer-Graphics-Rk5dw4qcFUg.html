plenty of smoke plenty of explosions
high-definition shadows and a ton of
anti-aliasing mixed in many youngins
take these visual creations for granted
and I don't blame them it's all they've
ever known for the most part but I want
to step back way back I'm only 21 so I
fit into this category as well the quote
worst computer-generated graphics I can
remember were from my uncle's old
Nintendo 64 so yeah not that far back
now at the time the games look great
cutting-edge and snappy I didn't think
that they were terrible but of course in
comparison they aren't even in the same
realm I want to step back much further
than that to the time of cathode ray
tubes there's an off chance you still
may be using one they aren't extinct but
they've been phased out by LCD and OLED
technologies color CRTs use electron
firing guns with different phosphors to
display images against a lead glass
screen remember high-energy waves
emitted from electron clouds are not
good for you we call them x-rays these
are technically analog displays which
are based on voltages that change over
time digital displays utilize
intermittent pulses of data instead
which is why they can transmit more data
per second typically most electronics
are not digital many would argue that
analog graphics don't really fall under
the same category but nonetheless it's
where it all started and that's what
we'll discuss first and what better way
to start them with a game like space war
it has its roots in a little College you
may have heard of MIT only the most
prestigious schools that access to
top-of-the-line tech and in 1962 this
was it it was written for the PDP one
which utilized 2700 transistors compared
to over 1 billion transistors found in
modern until skylake processors we've
come a long way the game utilized a
color cathode ray tube and quickly pave
the way for arcade games like asteroid
the game circular screen was
predominantly neutral and featured
unique physics charts mimicking those
you would experience in real life you
can actually play a Java rendered
version of this game via the link in
this video's description it has a bit of
a learning curve but it's very cool to
step back in time like this
and to think that this was once
cutting-edge computer graphics also bled
into virtual reality in the same decade
yes computer-generated VR was
invented in 1966 Ivan Sutherland built
the first computer-controlled hmd the
head-mounted device which used two
independent screens to display wireframe
images the technology was revamped by
NASA in the 1980s but Sutherland became
a graphics pioneer soon after its
creation he moved to the University of
Utah and trained folks like John Warnock
who later invented Adobe Systems I'm
sure you've heard of that I know I have
Photoshop After Effects and programs of
that sort you get the point remember
computer graphics doesn't just involve
moving images so pictures like this one
were being sculpted more and more by
computers than by hand
in 1972 pong was created by Allan Alcorn
and employee of Atari as a quote-unquote
training exercise it was basic at first
but thanks to advancements in both
memory and compute power Alcorn was able
to add additional features over time
increasing the level of difficulty and
overall interest as a result it was
popularized in its arcade cabinet style
and later emulated on more complex
machines by 1980 computers were bleeding
into homes and offices as consumer and
commercial products rather than least
experimentation machines dire straits
money for nothing music video was one of
the first 100% three-dimensional
computer-generated productions ever
undertaken and it was a definite hit for
MTV
it was definitely primitive no one is
arguing that but it was a landmark
nonetheless and the signal of another
great beginning Pixar released one of
the first shader programs in 1988 a big
step for CGI and was later used to
create fully computer-generated movies
Toy Story 1995 it's a jump ahead but
bear with me became the first
full-length fully computer animated film
under the Pixar Animation Studios name
in terms of arcade in computer gaming I
can personally recall games like
paperboy and pokemons grabbing my
attention even well into the 2000s
actually Marble Madness Tetris classic
arcade games that have been remade and
revamped time and time again thanks to
their basic yet addicting styles metal
gear anyone created in 1987 and ported
to the NES albeit with heavy mods this
one gave uses an unfamiliar take on
third-person gameplay graphics weren't
phenomenal but it gave the impression of
true depth as did later games like doom
resolution at this point wasn't the
priority was arguably depth the strive
for a true three-dimensional gaming
that would be both captivating and
immersive we finally got it with a game
called quake real-time 3d with eventual
support for OpenGL 3d rendering adding
to the smooth gameplay and boom just
like that first person shooters
role-playing games even car racing games
all became just more interesting
anything that wasn't 3d was suddenly
considered old it's a trademark of
technology in general there's always
something better and after quake
developers could not keep up regardless
of the platform or target audience
consoles like the Sony Playstation which
I deconstructed right here began
releasing titles that were based on
older franchises Metal Gear is an
example I mean look at the difference
there a personal favorite of mine Crash
Bandicoot became a huge hit as well I
had to mention it sorry for movies at
this point computer-generated graphical
interfaces were staples just look at
Terminator 2 I mean the concept behind a
liquid metal machine would not be
possible without CGI period
how about Independence Day all those
alien spacecraft battles CGI and green
screens of course all controlled and
rendered by computers with dedicated
graphics cards and fully compliant 3d
compute software I know I'm jumping
around quite a bit there's a lot of
information to consume but you get my
point things exploded at around the same
time the 3d rendering became
technologically possible we had games
like Diablo and Max Payne in The Sims
all work into the computer consumer
industry full-length CGI films like
Final Fantasy the Spirits Within
captivate audiences with breathtaking
and surprisingly realistic textures and
shadows for 2001 I remember when this
movie was released it was it was crazy
and open-world concepts like grand theft
auto vice city racking millions on the
first modern consoles I want to end the
video like this here is the first Grand
Theft Auto ever released I still
remember this game as a kid and here's a
clip of Grand Theft Auto 5 at max
settings and in a much higher resolution
we've come a long way in just 20 years
and we've come much further in the past
40 and 20 more channels like my own will
have this GTA on the left and a much
newer and more realistic game on the
right what do you imagine it look like
it's anywhere close to the difference
between GTA and GTA 5 I don't know I
can't picture it just yet but it'll be
here before we know it be sure to give
this video a thumbs up if you thought it
was cool give it a thumbs down
you feel the complete opposite or if you
hate everything about life be sure to

already stay tuned for more interesting

the other history videos that I have in
