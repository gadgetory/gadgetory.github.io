the 25th it's gonna be 25th after-hours
livestream welcome back folks if new I
appreciate you stop it in look these are
pretty laid-back they always are I just
sit here answer questions that's why I
call it a QA and they never know then we
do something a little different to
change things up so you still get to ask
questions I have you guys right here in
the chat and so I'm looking at those if
you want to what's going on trucker bomb
I see this three stars looking good mud
dude so if you want to ask a question
feel free to do that I actually have a
pen and paper right here I'm gonna keep
track of the questions that I see the
interesting questions good ones that we
haven't answered before especially those
I'm gonna get to as soon as possible
but I do want to address the second part
of this title which this goes back so if
you guys if you guys watch the channel
maybe a year and a half two years ago I
don't know how long it was okay I think
it was two years ago we did a video with
McLovin called ghetto studio called
episode one and I've always wanted to go
back and and kind of like elaborate on
that video or that topic at least I
didn't want to keep showing the same
office space wherever you want to call
it but basically people set up so that
aren't the prettiest maybe they're not
the nicest in the sense that like you
know the parts are cheap and they've got
stuff all over the place and just weird
configs and that's kind of what I want
to showcase see a lot of channels have
gotten their you know pet sees clawing
at the door a lot of tech channels in
the past have gotten notoriety from
promoting builds and setups that look
really good but I want to take a
different spin on this I want to
highlight build that need a lot of work
and that's why it's called ghetto studio
now we have a playlist for this there's
a little one video in it it's michael
evans video but i do want to do come do
something like it something like a
giveaway or something with with that and
i want to make it either a weekly or a
monthly thing so
here's might hear my thoughts and you
guys let me know what you think because
I think this I think this would be a
cool way to get engaged and to be more
active and maybe more hands-on at least
with the content you see so my thoughts
were one we're going to have video
submissions and how you're gonna submit
those you're gonna upload those videos
to your YouTube channel okay so if you
have YouTube channel great if you don't
have one it takes ten seconds to set up
and then it doesn't matter how you film
it honestly if you film it on your
camera that's fine like it doesn't have
to be professional at all I don't expect
you to have two $3,000 camera sitting
around and I want you guys to take just
one minute and film your setup I kind of
show me around your room or at least the
space that you want us to judge show us
inside your build tell us what's in your
system and try to crunch you can usually
crunch that down to a minute try to keep
it within a minute time frame and we'll
publish this all officially in a real
video soon these are my thoughts and I
want you guys to give me feedback on
that so if you have all of that you know
in a video then I'll review those and
I'll pick the sketchiest like four or
five I think we're gonna for four at a
time
and if you're not selected the first
week we do these or whatever don't worry
we'll still recycle those and I'll pick
more from the next set so as long as the
setup is not like super clean it's not
the point here we're going for the
setups that need improvement because
then what we're gonna do we're gonna
judge those and my my goal with the
judging is I want you guys to be totally
in charge who gets selected to be the
winner
which I guess is also the loser as it
means you have the worst setup but you
get to win something too
so depending on how you want to do it if
we do this on a weekly basis then we can
probably do I'm thinking around 100
bucks per week per winner and so what
we'll do is say you're the winner which
means you're the loser you have the most
sketchy most ghetto setup here's 100
bucks go improve your setup somehow and
then maybe you will get to see pictures
of like a
custom cables or something and maybe you
cleaned it up and you wait you bought
yourself you know a really nice meal for
cleaning up your studio I really don't
care how you spend it you could spend it
on whatever you want but by that point
you know you're already gonna be the
winner for that week having the most
ghetto set up so there's a chance to win
cash obviously if you have a really nice
setup already you probably don't need
the money to improve your setup anymore
that's not what this series is intended
to do it's actually supposed to help
those who either don't have the money or
just don't care maybe that maybe this
will be a little kick in the butt
to get started on cleaning up your
system a little more take pride in your
work especially if you built it yourself
take pride in it so I want you guys to
give me some feedback I have the
comments here and yes so glitch Tech's
sketchy builds that's why it's called
ghetto studio that's the name of the
playlist and on that playlist my goal is
to have roughly every week four
contestants four people who submitted
video well who uploaded videos to their
YouTube channels sent their links to me
either via email or via Twitter excuse
me and then from there I'll pick four
that I think are super ghetto I'll
showcase all four kind of run through my
own thoughts there and then I'll post
all four up on Twitter and we'll have a
poll and straight up the you know the
build that or the set up that gets the
most amount of votes is the most ghetto
for the week and that winner will win a
hundred bucks basically and the cool
thing about it being cash or money is I
can send it to anybody so as long as you
have a PayPal account which you should
if your country doesn't have PayPal will
work something else out but as long as
you have a way of receiving money safely
then you'll be able to win so it's not
like a component where if you live in
like I don't know Afghanistan or
something that like it's really
difficult for people in the States or
elsewhere to send you stuff then maybe
just the money transfer online will be
easier so we're not basically singling
out certain countries that have shipping
restrictions and stuff and that's why
international giveaways are so difficult
to do
Oh someone said the chat and the stream
isn't moving that's true I just I
noticed that note to you what the heck
is going on let's see okay I'm gonna re
copy and paste the chat pop out that's
really strange okay yep all right should
be working now thank you for pointing
that out though I didn't notice that
earlier okay
sooo yeah making sure that it looks
right in the stream okay yeah we're good
we're good
from the visiting that's a good point
though
bazinga so to make sure that these
submissions are genuine I'm gonna have
you guys put like a special I don't know
a special number or something in your
picture so if I if I select your video
then to make sure that it's your video
I'm going to have you take a picture in
front of that build with holding like a
certain number kinda like what you do on
eBay and that way I can be sure that
it's you submitting the bill that you're
actually in front of your system if it's
your friends system whatever that's fine
try not to be super shady I can't make
it foolproof but just be honest with it
and to be honest I mean there's one
winner a week and we're gonna be doing
these I assume at least 40 weeks a year
maybe more than that so your chances of
winning something of winning a hundred
bucks at some point are pretty high now
I don't know how long I can do this my
goal is to eventually have sponsors to
cover these videos every week honestly
in the grand scheme of things 100 bucks
for a sponsored spot isn't really that
expensive so I think we can get it done
worst case I'll just pay out of pocket
for a while until we get those things
rolling so we'll see put two yeah that's
a good idea checker bum but I'm thinking
something I mean because you could
really do it with any anybody's system I
think I want to do a specific number
that way I know for sure that it's that
person submitting it so yeah so shariq
the keyboard the mouse
I want all that in the
video of like the little showcase
walk-around that you do so it's it's an
entire setup basically it's it's a
ghetto studio studios whatever you're
using in your workflow to to get things
going
bazinga Thanksgiving my dude when is
Lisa coming over I asked I asked as
dinner is on me lisa has she's gonna be
coming back soon like with this but you
know immigration it's not easy it's a
very long process and we might talk more
about that soon we've talked about it
before on the live streams but she is
just back in Germany just doing her
thing I'm doing my thing we're calling
every day and that's really all we've
been able to do for the past year and a
half so it's something I wouldn't wish
on my worst enemy
it really sucks but she'll be back here
probably I would say November ish
timeframe I might be going there soon I
don't know but if if I do then we'll do
something really creative Andrew right
good question Andrew for the age limit
of the giveaway so here's how I've
always done this in the past and I'm
pretty sure I've been in a clear legally
by doing this so following YouTube's
Terms of Service state laws stuff like
that we have a minimum age for the
giveaway at 18 but if you're under the
age of 18 all you got to do is have your
parent or guardian enter for you so if
they enter on your behalf if they're the
ones filming or whatever I mean honestly
I just want to make sure that I'm
sending them the money for their
submission but I mean they whatever they
do with the money after that is up to
them you guys catch my drift so if just
have a parent or guardian submit it for
you and you can we'll figure that out if
it's really gonna come down to that but
I think we'll be okay if we do it the
way we've always been doing it so if
you're 18 or older you have no problems
at all if you're under the age of 18
again parent or guardian represent you
and you'll be fine let's see so alex is
a giveaway did you if you just tuned in
Alex you gotta rewind the livestream I
just talked about it
perks for being here early right so if
you guys want to give me any feedback I
will appreciate it I think what we're
gonna do is stick to a week ahead of
time right now and I'm gonna try to keep
the giveaways to 100 bucks apiece but
again you got to do the work for it so
you actually have to submit you've got
to give me a video that I can actually
watch that I can post to to the channel
for other people to see if I select you
to be in the top 4 for that week if we
don't have enough submissions per week
then we'll move it to a monthly thing
it's just something that we're gonna
have to kind of feel out so it's it's
entirely experimental I don't know how
well it'll work I don't know how
interested you guys would even be but I
think it would be interesting I think
it'll be fun I think it'd be kind of
cringy but that's ok you know like
that's that's the point is if you win
you get to improve your system and even
if you don't win excuse me I'm still
gonna give you constructive feedback so
I'm gonna tell you ways you can improve
your system based on what I see in your
videos so we'll see ok so again if you
have any other like if you guys want to
come back later when this video is
archived and leave comments then I can
check those out I'll make notes as well
but I think I have the framework
basically set up by this at this point I
don't see any immediate objections so
we're looking pretty good here I think
ok Stefan are no I didn't I don't know
what that is
Wizard core is a $400 Australian or 290
USD for a 1070 a good use deal it's
gonna depend ultimately on the market
294 1070 here in the States isn't that
great if it's used you could get ten
seventies here in the States for as long
as like 240 bucks so I knowing that a
back of my head I wouldn't pay more than
about 250 for a 1050 at this point
excuse me 1070 and then about 220 ish
for a 980ti
which is comparable and then in
Australia I know things are generally
more expensive shipping import tariffs
taxes all that crap so I would say
you're probably on the upper echelon if
that's considerably cheaper than what
you can buy it new for put it this way
then that should be fine
okay so scrolling down here Simon good
question so easy Hass can you try your
luck multiple times and the answer that
is you'll do that anyway every week you
don't have to submit or resubmit your
videos every week so to prevent people
from spamming me if I get the same video
submitted like four or five times I'm
just gonna invalidate your entry
I have archived all I will archive every
video that is submitted as long as it's
not a repeat of the same video Center
earlier and I'll have those in like a
little library so if we don't have let's
say enough unique entrants for that week
or maybe I really like your your ghetto
build but it just didn't make the cut
the week before I'll still put it in the
next week or maybe the next week so I'll
keep referring back to those if they
haven't already been submitted which is
good for you guys because let's say a
certain week we don't have any more so
you know any more people submitting pcs
then the people who have already applied
are gonna have that much better of a
chance of being in that week's feature
so you don't have to submit multiple
times it's kind of automatic because
I'll have them on hand and I'll know
which ones I've already entered into the
contest and what you haven't so that'll
be good Jeff Phillips it's not a photo
it's a video excuse me that's that's the
key that's what I want to be different
than then you know just showing pictures
like side shots and stuff other channels
do that that we want to make it more or
less into a giveaway thing but I want to
be able to show people video because I
want you to show me your entire setup
not just your PC I want to see your
monitors I'm gonna see your peripherals
I'm gonna see your chair your desk what
you're using for a desk I used a dresser
for a long time as a desk you know if
you guys need ideas if you think your
your studio or setup is you know
comparable to McClellan's
in our get a studio video the only one
in that playlist then you should enter I
think you have a good chance of being
featured frog where do we submit stay
tuned that's gonna come in a video
announcement this week so I will have
eight I'm gonna set up a separate email
specifically for the entries so if you
submit your entry to my business email
I'm not gonna open it
I'm just gonna throw it in spam I get
tons of emails already most of them
which are already spam so don't send it
to my business email I'm at a separate
email for entry so I can keep all of
that separated and then we'll also have
multiple submission script running to
make sure that nobody is submitting the
same thing three or four times over the
course of a month or whatever and yes PR
it's international
like I said earlier in the live stream
it's a cash giveaway so you're gonna get
100 bucks cash I'm just gonna transfer T
via PayPal or whatever we deem is safe
and that's my way of keeping it
international because it's shipping
stuff to I use to Afghanistan before but
like you know Mongolia or some place
that's like just difficult to get stuff
to relatively speaking
then that's it's kind of unfair for
those people so money transfers over the
web it's easy
usually secure and will be fine
Sam Sanchez no you cannot submit your PC
if it's not done yet it has to be on and
running good points so your system has
to be working and I'm writing these down
as I speak so it must be working on your
desktop like just have your desktop open
all these rules by they by the way will
be in the description of the video that
specifically announces this giveaway so
and look you know remember that this is
supposed to be a ghetto studio setup so
if you have really nice stuff don't
bother entering because you're not gonna
be included in it it defeats the whole
purpose of the theme like if your setup
is really nice and it's not ghetto then
it's not gonna go and they get a studio
playlist this is only for people who
think they have setups that are a little
cringy maybe they need some work you
know they need some work cable
management's not that great maybe just
for a really dirty work area that's the
kind of ghetto I'm talking about again
watch Michael Evans video in the get a
studio playlist if you need ideas and I
want you to stay to this whole thing but
if you're curious as to whether or not
you qualify just watch the video if you
do anything like he does I would deem
that pretty sketchy so that would make
you a valid entry and do those again
well you'd probably in here when you
type that in but what I just said
answers your question
doulas let's see okay what about laptop
users mmm now laptop now I'm not gonna I
don't think that that's no I'm not I'm
not gonna allow laptops because it's
just too easy and there's nothing I mean
part of the whole ghetto build process
or get a studio idea is that the system
itself is supposed to be a little messy
so if your system is perfectly clean but
you got clothes all over the floor
that's probably not gonna count as an
entry now if your system is just old
it's rough it's got no basement and
cables are kind of everywhere and you're
using like a dining room table chair as
a desk or a dining room tables a desk
may be like a dining room chair as a
chair whatever you guys get my point
right like some stuff that's just not
traditional gaming stuff that you've
just had to kind of use because that's
all you have I totally understand look I
was using a chair I don't if you guys
know this but like two years ago I was
using an old computer chair that my dad
had for work from like 15 years ago I'm
like the whole bottom piece like the
whole bolstered part on the bottom was
completely ripped shreds the foam in
there was like falling out you couldn't
see it because it was off camera but it
was right below the camera field of view
and and I used again I used my dresser
as a desk I used one of the drawers as
like a holder for my keyboard which at
the time was a wireless like little
membrane keyboard because that was all I
had
yeah so those are some ideas just if
you're in that ballpark
it probably constitute it constitutes as
yet oh I guess I should say so yeah and
exactly nicks and mix I think for
reference people got to see the mclovin
fit for reference yeah that's what I've
been saying this whole time you got to
watch Michael Evans video to know
exactly what I'm talking about if you
have anything set up anywhere remotely
close to how he dies then it's probably
a little sketch let's see Alex Padilla
it really I mean look it's just what's
in the video I don't care if you have
four builds
and you don't want me to see the nice
build you just have one sketchy bill and
you want to put that in the video that's
fine but don't make it if you make it
weird and like you show me like your
five systems and then you pan over to
this ugly corner I'm probably not gonna
validate that because to me it just
shows that you staged data or like that
you just you pick the worst of
everything on purpose to make it look
really bad so you could win a hundred
bucks I'm gonna be pretty you know I'm
gonna scrutinize these and and I'm gonna
try to figure out who's genuine and
who's not just based on the video and
and kind of like the tour you guys gave
me if you show me more it's better
because it shows me you have nothing to
hide it's like you know this side of the
room is horrible but this side the rooms
really nice like if you show me the
whole room even if it's your bedroom I
don't care just and if you don't want
that stuff in the video that's fine I'll
try to keep it to just the tech but if
you show me that then I know that it's
I'm sorry about that then I know that
it's you know not staged I guess I
should say so Jeff the cat is outside
because she crunchy clan's behind the
desk and steps on the power cable power
strip back there and everything gets
shut off that's happened more than once
while i was playing pub gee that answers
your question I guess boozing I think
but I found other super chat again
let's see scroll on what's going on
mister KF game and look over those three
stars right there its mmm says lol bro
why you screaming at 5:20 a.m. cuz brah
I don't live in your time zone that's
why brah I live in the central time zone
sounds like you live in Germany seven
hours ahead so you probably live east of
Germany I would say Egypt area maybe
Turkey I don't know I don't know where
the time zone changes then that's close
to there anyway
yeah membrane keyboards do have their
advantages although I will say once you
switch to mechanicals it's really
difficult to switch him back and prefer
it anyway okay so you guys know those
are the general rules I don't see too
many objections with the rules I think
it'll be interesting what's going on
Cody I see you there what's going on no
one
and again if you if you missed all the
rules so the things were
talking about earlier with respect to
the ghetto studio giveaways just rewind
the livestream or wait till it's
archived we're also gonna publish an
official video outlining the Official
Rules they'll also be in the video
description and then I'll also give you
the special email that we're going to
use so you can submit your videos that
you publish to your channels so that's
really that's really it I think that's
it
I think that's it with respect to get us
to do giveaways so now on to the
questions as is a good old-fashioned Q&amp;amp;A
at this point it's what we usually do on
the live streams but I'm here to help
you guys out whatever whatever you need
whatever questions you have that need
answering I will do my best to answer
them given the limited knowledge I have
in this subject I would say that if I
don't know it I'll go and research it
and if I still don't know it then I'll
ask somebody who has also researched it
see if they know the answer its mm what
about thoughts on r-tx 20 atti
i literally have a video like three
videos talking about the RT x series you
should go watch those
let's see Andrew right what's it like
wearing glasses I'm getting some soon
any tips look eventually glasses are
like a part of your body you just forget
that you're even wearing them I've gone
to sleep with my glasses on before I've
showered with my glasses before just
because I don't remember that they're on
I do wear contacts too but usually only
when I play sports or like I'm in the
gym if I'm outside at the beach or
something at some moments I'm gonna do
it
let's see streamer man says you bias
against laptops he is a reason why you
don't like laptops I have a laptop that
I've I use it all the time the huawei
mate book X Pro the beautiful laptop
doesn't make it a setup a laptop to me
is not a setup you have to have monitors
you know a case a specific build like a
custom build not a laptop you can find
everything's already there and then
keyboard mouse all the goodies laptop
you can use it your lap but a desktop
requires a dedicated set of dedicated
space for that that's why I'm
discriminating against mobile computers
okay let's see here James Hall says
don't swim with glasses yeah that's
probably a good idea
Oh meow meow asks what do you think
about the slim gaming laptops I've seen
a couple of them I haven't tested any
specific like thin ki laptop recently I
will say that I'm just not the biggest
fan of 15.6 inch and 17 inch laptops I
really like the 14 inch form factor and
slightly smaller than that and and
that's that's really it like it like I
said the maple X Pro is like the perfect
form factor for me the MX 150 in there
the discrete GPU is good enough for what
I need I don't need to play hardcore pub
G on it or anything but it'll run things
decently it's great for Adobe Premiere
Pro and again it's tiny by comparison
it's got a beautiful screen edgeless
screen battery life is actually really
good on it I'm actually really impressed
from from Huawei I expected a lot worse
and I think it's probably the best
Ultrabook right now you can buy and it's
one of the most powerful ultra ebooks
that you can buy
what's up Tech tuner life says yo grip
okay let's see Michael asks you think
RTX 20 80 22 TI will improve with driver
updates because 1080p is the same as
1080 to 1080i yes usually I mean if you
look historically driver updates usually
account for five to ten percent
performance increase over the course of
maybe a year so I know for a fact when
the 92 Ti and the tens women well when
the 1070 came out and I tested the 90
DTI in the 1070 remember the founders
edition 1070 was actually a really good
car it still is if you want to buy one
if you can find it used I recommend
buying used but those reference coolers
so to speak are actually really good and
they're actually quite quiet unless you
plan on like keeping your clocks really
high all the time which you don't really
need to do because the frequencies are
gonna scale according to temperature
overhead anyway those two carts were
neck-and-neck
literally neck-and-neck in some cases
the 92 TI one some cases the 1071
now with the most recent testing I've
done the 1070 is a slightly better card
I would say the frame rate disparity if
it was 0% before is maybe 6 to 7% now
and that's after 2 years right so that's
2 years worth of driver updates and
that's not to say that the 980ti wasn't
crippled at all that might have been the
case new drivers tend to leave the old
hardware behind and that's the incentive
right to buy the new stuff and video
want you'd buy the new stuff so they may
unintentionally cripple old hardware
with new software but I would say and
your most circumstances between 5 and
10%
Mac's unless there's just like a
terrible driver that's that's out there
right when everyone benchmarks which has
happened before but most of the time 5
to 10 ok let's see I'm gonna scroll up
here I missed quite a number of
questions okay alright here we go
Adam Stephenson 22 Ti prices later this
year in the beginning of next year I
totally misread that question Colten
opinion on 10 ATT is Li with horizon 7
1800 X perfectly fine perfectly viable
if you're playing higher and 4k gaming
that that's gonna be really sweet setup
there there there's nothing wrong with
that I mean if anything your CPU is
almost always gonna be the bottleneck
unless the game is not SLI optimized in
which case you're just wasting one card
I've had my experience with SLI and I
would say it's it's hit or miss most of
the time I don't have an issue with it
but under a few circumstances I've
noticed terrible frame skipping and
stuttering and that all goes away when
you disable SLI in the control center so
anyway ok so let's see here Co fossa
asks or says you should make a new
bottlenecking video because people still
don't get bottlenecking isn't 1% depend
on what parts they have I have two
videos on bottlenecking
they can go back and watch this video
I'm not gonna remake them again that's
why they're up there they're up there
forever for as long as the channel
exists and YouTube exists so you can go
back and watch those
let's see bob hump lick gotta love these
names that hole in video stock drop
thing was just so the brokers can buy a
bunch of invidious stock cheap they know
Nvidia have a strong position
and nvidia dominates right now with
respect to the AI the AI field is just
growing and honestly the applications
they're probably endless with tensor
cores RT cores the ray-tracing thing I
think is gonna catch on later I don't
think that's something that many people
should be concerned about right now if
you bought Pascal and you're pissed that
you bought Pascal instead of RT X don't
be it's really I mean Turing is Turing
is an expensive first release and if
there's one thing I've learned my 23
years which admittedly isn't it's not a
lot of time to gain experience but I
have learned that being the first person
to do something it's most of the time
not the best way to approach it you want
to be the follower in that sense you
want to be the second or third
implementer because then you can refine
imperfections associated with the first
release and make it that much better and
that's certainly not what we saw with
things like physics I mean that
definitely died out but with respect to
rate racing I do think that is the
future I think that's how games will
eventually all be rendered but the
problem is getting old hardware right to
keep up with those demands and
developers don't want to do that so
whenever I know Chris Chris said earlier
he said something about developers
catching on stuff like that via be epic
Chris that's that's not something that
just happens overnight I know you know
that but it's not something even that
happens two or three years you might
have certain titles that are r-tx
dependent but they're still gonna have
that option to turn off RT X whatever
that entails DL SS you know all this
stuff that that's just heavy on the
system and a majority of people I mean
look at steam surveys I'm majority
people have 10 60s and below on NVIDIA
side GTX 10 60s those cards are 2 to 300
bucks they're not gonna afford $700
cards and by the time those cards are 4
or 5 years old they're still probably
going to be more expensive than what
people in that range can afford I don't
expect to see 20 80s and 20 DT is
costing two to three hundred dollars for
five years and I would be genuinely
impressed if that was the case so
because people spent so much money on
them in the first place they're not
gonna want to let him go for that few
for that
little I guess I should say so yeah yeah
Christy yeah Chris agreed for RTX off
will be really common for quite some
time
yeah we can both agree on that what's
going on Brian Greg Moore hey I'm honest
and listened to me hand gestures please
love the thumb what I gotta add bride is
Ahmad I totally should have that a while
back Brandon is a negative pressure in
lien Leo 11 dynamic really bad for temps
no negative pressure I've had my fair
share of negative and positive pressure
differentials I would say without doing
much research into the topic having a
positive pressure in the case meaning
the pressure inside the case is slightly
higher than the environment is slightly
more ideal for one keeps dust out dust
tends to settle where air moves and air
moves into places that are you know less
pressurized so from a dust perspective
it makes more sense to keep it positive
and at the same time I think that
because you have I mean either way right
if you have a vacuum and you're pushing
air in or you have a lot of air in here
and it's pushing it out it's you're
gonna get the same effect the same flow
but at the expense of dust a few other
things I would say in most cases the
positive air pressure slightly positive
you don't want hardcore positive a
slightly positive air pressure is
probably the better option in a case but
if you're running slightly negative like
if you have all your fans pulling out of
the O 11 dynamic you might want to
change a couple of those to N because
remember your graphics card has to pull
in air too so you don't want to starve
your graphics card for air but it of
course depends on the car the clocks and
everything else ah chef at this is a
he'd do you think arisin 520 600 will
bottleneck at 2070 if we assume a 2070
is equivalent to maybe a gtx 1080 then
no i think it 2600 is for that that's a
really good CP for the money first off
and I think that that chips gonna fetch
it's gonna last four or five years and
be a steal you know how it was with like
the core i5 like the 2500 the
you know I have your bridge stuff the
like trying to think of Ivy Bridge and
not as well you guys know what I'm
talking about Ivy Bridge and the other
one oh my gosh why can't I think of it
sandy bridge that's what I was trying to
say sandy bridge yeah those CP that's
ready to be phased out now because I
have to series between that and like in
8700 K pretty far apart if you if you
compare them core decor the ibc
difference is about 20 to 30 percent it
depends on the game and the application
and this would be the time at which I
would say if you're on something like a
2500 then upgrading makes sense in my
book you don't have to upgrade and state
you don't have to move on to the best
from Intel you can move to AMD and
probably notice next and no difference
between that and if you had chosen and
8700 okay now as for the new stuff from
Intel not too sure yet I don't want to
speculate you know there's a lot of lot
of rumors and stuff going around and I
really don't like diving into rumors
because if I'm wrong then everyone's
like hahaha
you were wrong but it's just like hey I
was just going off of what I knew you
know what to do I'm wrong so I'm just
like fiddling with that I like waiting
for the facts or what appear to be facts
I will make spec you you know I will
speculate if I know or if I have a
really strong gut feeling that
something's sketchy or that something is
is accurate based on multiple sources
multiple accounts that's why I did what
I did with with NVIDIA his the way that
they presented those cars there's just
like come on I got a call BS right there
something doesn't look right
based on just precedent alone the way in
which they release these cards or tried
to hype them up was just totally off the
books and that was why I made the first
video that I made about them think
something's fishy
and sure enough I mean I I think we can
all say now that the reason why they
didn't show many direct comparisons
between touring and Pascal's because
Turing wasn't that big of an improvement
from just a raw FPS perspective and
that's what people understand they
understand fps they don't understand you
know RTX ops whatever the heck those are
you know like this is made and made up
metrics by Nvidia to compare cards that
have all these extra features that a lot
of people probably won't even use
so again this is the first generation of
this stuff I expect two three
generations down the line it will be
pretty mainstream for NVIDIA and maybe
even AMD so we'll see how AMD responds
okay let's see scrolling up here
Jake define assess what's your opinion
our TX 2080 benchmarks thank you I just
said that I guess I'm not impressed I'm
really not and it's something that I
basically called from the beginning just
like there's a reason why it's it's a
little concealed it's on the DL and the
reason why is because it's really not I
mean for 700 800 bucks sometimes more
than that for just a twenty eighty
you're getting ten atti performance I
mean within five or ten percent in most
cases and I'll be getting a couple cards
in soon to do my own tests but from
watching my colleagues benchmark these
cards I really think that it's just it's
a it's just I don't know it's a it's a
side great it's not really an upgrade so
yeah that's about all I want to really
say on RT X at this point I want to hold
the rest of my comments for after I've
personally tested them I know the price
is gonna be something that I'm always
gonna be against but you never know and
we're gonna test we gotta test is it
right to say sli if it's in V link that
you guys know what I mean
power draw thermals I want to test all
of that with a couple cards I got coming
in and we'll see bazinga I missed her
there super Chatterley I'm gonna scroll
up to that one first let me see here he
says did you say you are 23 I have
underwear older than Neil oh that's good
my dude and then he says Microsoft
finally made something that did not suck
a vacuum cleaner
oh that's worth it that's good stuff
let's see I like the livestream skin
you're using I pre I actually made this
myself it just kind of it probably looks
like I made it myself maybe you weren't
complimenting me but anyway I did make
it myself so if you're impressed by it
cool I appreciate it but if you're not
whatever I totally understand it took me
like 20 minutes to do this and that's
just because I don't really think that
these live streams
to be that professional-looking this is
just me talking into it
c920 $40 webcam to you guys because I
just want to answer questions I want to
do that every week so you guys feel like
you're getting a more personal touch to
the channel all right let's see here Oh
an odd fellow asks at science studio hi
I'm getting a 360 money I owe is it okay
to put all fans in a pull config to make
it easier to clean well it's still cool
well sure yeah there's really nothing
majorly wrong with that I've run rads in
that config before so what he's saying
is you can have the fans pull in so if
this is the inside your case here then
you have your rad and then you put your
fans on the inside and you have a pool
air right so doing that is going to give
you basically the same effect so instead
of pushing air through fins you're gonna
be pulling ambient air through fins and
like again this is something that I
haven't really run serious tests on I'm
sure there are other channels other
websites that have documented this more
stringently than I ever have
but in my experience there's very small
differences between the two configs
maybe some differences in sound the way
it sounds right cuz it's it a pushing
air into fins which do create some
degree of resistance you're pulling air
through them and I don't know how that
will affect thermals or sound but in a
general sense based on what I think have
been both before I don't notice much of
a difference at all okay let's see here
Ericsson sentian
what's your opinion on the thermal take
suppressor f31 f31 look that up f31
totally miss type that suppressor always
the case okay ha oh yeah okay yeah this
is the one that looks almost identical
to the fractal design case yeah I'm not
just because the design itself is such a
ripoff blatantly it yeah literally you
look at that case and you think I've
seen that before the reason why you've
seen it before because it looks just
like a fractal but fine our v or r6
whatever
so yeah it is so similar how is that
even like it how is that even a thing
she's like you know I I know that other
people are like totally against thermal
tape because they do lately coffee stuff
and that's fine if you want a boycott
the company of whatever people rip each
other off all the time this is not an
isolated thing for just thermal I think
it's a little ignorant to just single
out one company say the only one company
rips other companies off and come on
ideas are literally stolen on a daily
basis between all these companies
they're competitors you want to improve
your competitors design so you have a
competitive advantage but yeah that
right there I mean that all straight up
say that that looks just like at least
externally just like a fractal design
what define r5 I think it's just or
define s I guess yeah it looks like a
fine ass so yeah okay chain eped
Epstein's has have you ever made
homemade ice cream it's really good I
don't know how I don't know what is
happening right now so can you fill me
in please
you can rewind the livestream if you
want to be 20 or so minutes behind
actually we've been doing it for 40
minutes
geez yeah that's that's pretty fast
let's see it's MMS so like if I have
every fan as intake it will generate
positive air pressure yes because you're
you're I mean assuming that there's not
like a wide open back panel where it's
just flowing smoothly you'll have some
sort of resistance keeping air trapped
in there and that is the positive air
pressure as a result let's see here
Nick and Mick are you still using the
rode videomicro I'm not I haven't used
it a long time actually I have the this
rode videomic pro plus now which is it's
a better microphone for several
applications I'll be doing a review on
that mic soon comparing it to the $50
mic let's see bendy I've got an open box
rx 584 gig and the card is running with
a with 1100 base in 1850 memory excuse
me
and both is 200 less than rated - okay
does anyone know why it is doing this
custom BIOS
and the are you talking about your clock
speeds usually these will be
self-regulating if you go and do a
crimson drivers or real if drivers
whether they call them it you can go in
there and actually tweak those you can
tweak voltages you can under bolt you
can usually tweak all that stuff so if
it's doing that it's just usually the
preset out of the box but you can
manipulate those two quite a quite a
great extent okay let's see and Oscar
think about that five dollar super check
Oscar I'd like your opinion what should
come first when upgrading a 1440p and
over sixty Hertz monitor or a gtx 1080i
GPU I'm running a 970 with an i5 4660
okay so you're on has well you've got a
GTX 970 and you're asking about a higher
refresh rate 1440p ish monitor so
something let's say 120 144 Hertz or gtx
ten atti my worry is that if you upgrade
the monitor first you're not really
gonna see the frames you would but you
would have to drop in game settings so
if you're comfortable dropping in game
settings to a certain extent and that's
fine I think it's a better bet to just
go with the monitor first I can say that
if you're gonna buy the gtx 980ti the
same issue is gonna exist
assuming you're on a sixty Hertz monitor
right now and maybe 1080p a 1080i is
super overkill for that so maybe instead
of getting a really expensive graphics
card or you know a really expensive
monitor how about getting them monitor
that's 1440p and 120 Hertz or 144 Hertz
for three three hundred fifty bucks
pixie oh it's got a really good when I
reviewed recently and then getting like
a gtx 1070 that's a big upgrade over a
970 so you know you don't need the best
if all you're gonna do is play in 1440p
you know I have 1440p 165 Hertz monitors
and I play on 1070 T eyes and that maxes
the screen result so you know you don't
need the best to for it to look good
Wells's at every flip up and rewrite as
hey Greg can you make a podcast you know
if I made a podcast
I've had a few people ask me this if I
made a podcast I would I would just I
don't know I feel like I would ramble
the entire time I guess if you guys
really like to hear me ramble then sure
I view a little ego boost I guess I
don't know why else you would want to
hear me talk unless it was about a
specific subject I really like astronomy
and physics I would love to have
podcasts like that it would just require
me to write the content and if I didn't
write it if I just kind of free balled
it then I feel like I would just be like
uh-uh the whole time and you would get
annoyed by the number of as you heard
cuz I was trying to you know gather my
thoughts so yeah maybe maybe at some
point if I get someone whose script
science to do videos someone that I
trust to script these videos then maybe
I could script my own podcast episodes
or whatever session so yeah that's
possibility I appreciate you asking that
though okay
let's see here oh yeah so Brian's
alluding to the number of CUDA cores
shut out of the 22 Ti that's what it
looks like so you'll be saying here 4608
CUDA cores yeah I think how many I'm
trying think of how many essence were
shut off from the standard tu 102 or tea
is tea you wanted to write remember how
they do this now 72 SMS fully enabled
let's see well no is it something -
fully enabled because I see tu 102 with
4608 but in the tu-104 3072 yeah I don't
I don't know I really don't I really
don't know I know that it was cut down
slightly I read that somewhere
I just yeah 4350 - okay
4350 you and 4608 is the full obvious
what you're saying so 43:32 I assume is
the 28th ETI I haven't looked up
recently but I that sounds right
so 4608 so you're saying that there's
probably like a Titan whatever Titan are
or something that ends up being the full
t 102 but I mean think about it if
they're already charging 1,200 bucks for
the 28th ETI or thousand bucks whatever
it actually ends up being then it's
gonna be yeah there's gonna be a $2,000
card maybe that we're talking about here
going out for precedent if the 980ti was
six hundred bucks or the 1080 I was six
seven hundred dollars and the Titan was
a thousand twelve hundred bucks it's a
you know usually it's about a two to one
ratio here from a price perspective
probably looking at around 1,500 to
2,000 bucks for whatever Titan if
there's a Titan although I do expect
that this will be it I mean if they
really something above this it's
literally just a cash grab for the peeps
that want the best and that sounds like
something in video would do so yeah yeah
because it's a cut-down t you want a to
core that makes sense
let's see Chris says something I want to
do to read a Strix 1080i t15 sloth will
be really close to the side panel glass
on a case with a variable GP male yeah
even if it's don't do it thermals will
be trashed and that's true I tried to do
that recently with a 92 TI that I bought
it was a doing a hassle out card and it
was like I mean there was nothing
between it and the garage nickel acid as
good as it looked
I just couldn't do it cuz it was just
gonna roast alive it was gonna roast
like Brian's doing taxes my dude I I
understand what you're going through
taxes so you guys don't taxes in
September that's kind of weird we do
taxes after that why it is it depends on
your fiscal cycle but taxes in the
States are usually what between January
February and like March April and that
time zone so yeah wasn't the Titan V
about $3,000 and yeah but I mean now
Titan D was different right because it's
heightened v well take that back that
wasn't different the Titan V is a
different architecture I should say so I
don't think it was ever intended to be
yeah and it's three grand right now you
could buy it for $3,000 but the Titan
he's so weird because like it was right
between Pascal and Turing and that was
the only card we got from the Volta
architecture so I don't I don't really
know what NVIDIA is doing here you know
like to be honest going through the
stuff just seems 21 billion transistors
3d stack memory so the HBM - I think
right did you mean to lose HP I'm doing
this yeah
hmm - 12 gigs yeah I mean and it's got
tensor cores 5120 CUDA cores it's just I
don't know it the Titan V is just one of
those weird like placement holders for
placement holders like yeah it's just a
weird placeholder for an architecture
that really was phased out as quickly as
it was phased in unless they're gonna I
mean maybe we never know they what they
might be doing is using Volta for the
lower end cards I don't know if this is
actually been widely talked about
probably has I'm just I'm thinking now
that's probably they're doing I can't
imagine an RT X 2060 year 2050 right why
would you have RT cores and stuff and
lower end hardware to me that makes no
sense that you're you're cutting in its
knees based on the video buffer and the
number of CUDA cores assumes it just
doesn't I don't know it's all kind of
confusing right now we'll see tech
addicts is that so nice to do keep the
great work up man also would you get a
GTX 2080 or 1080 TI for 650 us also
would you pair it with a risin 7 1700 at
3.7 gigahertz look yeah you could pair
either those GPUs with a with that CPU
and be fine in most titles 3.7 gigahertz
is a little low and you might be
crippled from a memory perspective I
would the biggest thing with with Rison
one is try to keep your memory frequency
as high as possible timings as low as
possible it really matters with Verizon
so if I had to choose between 2018
attend atti I mean if you're gonna spend
650 no matter what you might as well get
the 2080 but I think you get a lot more
bang for your buck if you go with a 1080
especially used or 1070 think you could
sli to 1080 s for 300 bucks apiece spend
$600 and get SLI 1080 performance which
assuming the game supports SLI is gonna
be slightly better than a 1080 TI single
1080i but more power drama stuff anyway
kind of floating around here let's see
okay oh that's true mark yeah
self-employed have to do quarterly
typically yeah in the states you really
depends on how you what you call
yourself in the eyes of the state so an
LLC can choose to do yearly taxes if
it's a pass-through sole proprietor type
deal which is what I which is what I do
so my file taxes once a year which means
I have to save money when I pay the
government government back because my
money isn't taxed when Google pays me so
it's like a it's all 1099 so basically
I'm a contractor for Google and they're
paying me a royalty or whatever a
commission based on the number of views
that I bring to videos but I have to
report all that income so I have to save
a certain amount of money every month to
make sure they have enough at the end of
the year at the end of the fiscal year
to pay the government so yeah just some
behind-the-scenes finance stuff anybody
with a you know their own business knows
about that but for those who doll that
is what we have to do either do it
yearly or quarterly you could do it
monthly even but we usually elect for
quarterly or yearly just because having
to do it every month would be a pain and
quarterly is nice but because you don't
have to save it the whole time not
tempted to spend it but it just means
more work doing taxes every quarter but
that's true that's part what Brian's
doing
so anyway alright give me some good
question folks need some good stuff here
we got about 10 minutes left in the
normal stream if I get some good
questions then I'll keep the stream
going but it looks like I mean I know I
titled this video specifically for you
know they get us to do stuff but again
if you if you got in just now and you're
not sure what's going on about with
respect to the ghetto studio giveaways
this live stream will be archived very
soon also if you want to rewind the live
stream I think you can do that so I
think I have that turned on playback
then you can rewind it and see what I
talked about the beginning let's see a
little loony $5.00 stupid Chet thank you
my dude been a while thought I would say
hello I appreciate that thank you for
dropping by on this sort of Sunday night
for you is it Monday morning either one
I don't either way I appreciate it if
it's a Monday Jesus more kudos to you
because I know how slow Monday's can be
for folks so
okay James Hall I think you know the
answer to that question let's see lucid
gamer 360 do you think an i-5 3550
bottlenecks of 750ti
no I don't think so I've had a similar
config before I had an i3 4150 and a 750
Ti and those were pretty balanced in
most of the games I was playing it was
pretty balanced okay if you spam the
chat you're gonna be put in timeout
don't spam the chat let's see here Tech
you see what do you think of dad man
becoming the new owner of tech yes City
it's leaf are you passing on Turing or
are you going to buy an RT X card I just
honestly get these cards sent to me I
don't really I don't buy new graphics
cards very much if I'm gonna buy any
graphics cards usually used one just
because most of what I do I buy them for
testing purposes I'm not worried about
them lasting very long if that is ever
an issue with used cards which it's
usually not so like I just bought like
three used cards very recently check out
my latest video if you haven't already
to talk more about that there but you
usually just I'm either send stuff or I
buy used because that's to me that makes
way more sense than buying you Will's
already telling everybody that were
gonna play pub G after the stream so I
guess I have no choice but to play pub G
after the stream oh gosh
excuse me let's see sukham I'm planning
on building my own case and water
cooling loop ooh I'd like to use copper
piping and copper components would it be
okay to use copper fittings with solder
a clean of course yeah I think so I
don't see anything immediately wrong
with that if someone knows I had a
better answer that question then sure
but if I was doing something similar I
thought I would think it with the okay
usually I do nickel plated copper just
because copper tends to react more than
nickel does but I don't see anything
wrong with it really if you're gonna
like powder-coated or something like
that and I think you'll be perfectly
fine
a lot of fittings are copper fittings so
that's a no I have alpha cool fittings
that are copper fittings but it that way
that's the Ryan stroke II approximate
release date for nine Chand Intel chips
I have no idea I'm not the guy to ask I
don't really follow rumours
that's just something that yep let's see
here what is the best
ITX case fractal nano i the franklin
animals cool i like the NZXT h200 i a
lot I think it's a really cool ITX case
the Manta was a cool is a weird kind of
quirky case but I like the Manta as well
I think yeah if I had to choose I really
like the h200 I I really do or the age
200
I like that case a lot so let's see
let's scroll them back he will doing
will things that's right pyro will doing
them real things
Salazar burns building an ass if it will
only use hard drives would i be fine
with that gigabit switch it's a question
for a will an really I've never built an
ass I want to build an ass so bad I
think I gave a switch is fine depends on
how many I don't know if I should even
say anything cuz I don't let's say the
wrong thing I'm pretty sure you'll be
fine
pretty sure unless I misunderstand the
question gigabit switch and therefore
it's a network thing let's see here more
physics vids have to do that maybe you
know gotta stay true the title or to the
name of the channel so yeah I think at
some point we'll do it Jason says they
see him scrolling they hatin geez okay
you guys are super chill we had about
what 300 people watching not bad for
Sunday night or Monday morning again
depending on where you live I appreciate
the views look so I like the podcast
idea someone brought that up I just
brought it to my attention again I think
at some point I'm I do a podcast you
know I get it all professional so I
sound like a radio host or whatever and
I'll try to sound as professional as
possible
I mean we'll pick some really cool
subjects and we'll just dive into them
you know we'll just see but I I have my
reservations about that because that's a
lot of time podcasts take a lot of time
to plan if you do them right unless you
just want to speak freely and I
you know if I want to stay true to
science if I want to straight to stay
true to the channel and most of the
things that we try to uphold here it
really wouldn't make much sense for me
to just ramble in front of a mic and say
something wrong sit another researcher
didn't have the info in front of me so
we'll see but I like the idea maybe
we'll do something totally off off the
books
so I'm just different also again with
respect to the giveaways just to recap
if you have a ghetto studio ghetto set
up I want you to film it with your phone
just keep it to a minute or so I don't
want five minute videos I'm not gonna
watch the whole five minute video we're
gonna have tons of submissions I expect
keep it to around a minute film your
setup film your desk your your case your
monitor show me around tell me what's in
your system and then you're gonna upload
that video to your YouTube channel if
you don't have one make one it takes
like a minute and then you're gonna send
me that link to a special email that
I'll give you in the dedicated video
that will be released and on the channel
soon that will have all that the
official rules I'm just kind of running
through this again
your systems got to be working it's got
to be a desktop and you have to be 18 or
older unless you have a parent or
guardian represent you which is pretty
easy to do so if you're under the age of
18 just have them do that you'll be good
I just wrote the word destroy I don't
know why I did that
and then that weird okay destroy must be
working must be a desktop that's what I
meant to write not destroy desktops only
18 years and older okay and will sis no
point
entering boys mine is the most ghetto of
them all was this pre sketch well has a
lot of hardcore stuff going on in his
studio but it's just sketchy you just
walk in you're like there's no way this
guy gets any work done but he does he
figures it out the weak link says we get
so destroyed with pricing and Canada
prices are way better in US yeah I've
definitely heard that more than once we
have I I can relate indirectly because
I've been in other countries where
prices are extremely expensive like I
could not live here I could not imagine
spending this much more money
four parts that again are the same oh
gosh okay
so those are gonna be the rules get out
I'll see to many objections people
freaking out the chatbox so maybe this
will be a thing we'll see we'll see if
we can build hype around this and turn
it into a weekly thing so every week
someone 100 bucks you know there'll be
something new and then to bring traffic
to the Twitter so we can grow our
Twitter Twitter presence we're gonna
have everyone vote on Twitter so if you
don't have a Twitter handle I'm sorry
that's just what I want to use for
voting cuz it's very simple to set up on
my on my part and the response is pretty
straightforward and everyone can see the
results right away
so I think that's what we're gonna do
and you'll be hearing something about
that soon probably this week and there
might be subtle changes but I think in
general that's what I want to do I think
to be creative would be fun funny and
entertaining for you guys something
different to look forward to on the
channel every week besides my face on a
live stream I think I missed a super
chat let me scroll back up here real
quick leave in Castillo I think about $2
super chat my dude risin 7 1700 X 16
gigs of RAM or two 8 gigs which is
better for Rison Verizon one you're
gonna want to 8 gigs I wouldn't go with
the four modules whereas and one tends
to do a lot better with 2 sticks of RAM
in my experience so I would stick with 2
there let's see CJ Concepcion hey Greg
have you dealt with a buggy asus
motherboard not really you mean buggy
from a BIOS perspective usually you can
update your UAF eyes and they don't get
rid of the bugginess but if it's doing
some weird stuff like booting up and
then shutting down and then turning back
on again and shutting down and then
turning on permanently like that's
usually it's just power cycling it's I
don't know I've had a couple boards do
that
Jorge my twitter is in the descriptions
in the description of every video so
yeah I think that's what we're gonna
keep it at I think we're gonna call it
quits now 10 p.m. if you guys have no
more didn't like y'all have any
questions this week maybe well next week
so again every week you have questions
look forward to the Sunday nights Monday
mornings and thank you guys for sitting
around listening me talk about the Godot
studio stuff I'm excited I think it'll
be really cool really fun way to
interact and just to have a laugh you
know like not to make fun of people and
their setups but just to genuinely be
interested in entertained by the way
people do things
you know because if they've left it that
way for a long time and it looks a
little ghetto it's subjective but if it
does then you know we can critique we
can have a have a laugh or two and then
maybe you can take something to heart
and fix something up if you think it
looks fine the way it is you know one
change anything that's fine I'm not
trying to get you to you know change
your lifestyle but if you're if you're
willing to contribute be good sport I
think this would be a really fun thing
and interesting and different thing in
