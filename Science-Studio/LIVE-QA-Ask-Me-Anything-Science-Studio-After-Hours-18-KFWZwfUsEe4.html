sure to mute everything on my desktop
because that was a unfortunate
experience with its last time and this
is just another ask me anything
livestream anything pertaining to tech
science whatever I can get my hands on
I'll do my best to sift through it I
will confess that I fell asleep on the
couch you can't tell it's been a long
day but that did not hinder our ability
to livestream tonight in this after
hours number 18 he believed heard an 18
of these so we do these once a week and
I know we had like four or five breaks
in there because of holidays and you
know stuff being on Sunday it's really
tough to get around you know like events
with families and whatnot when you have
breaks off from school and from work and
what-have-you so it's been kind of all
over the place but in the eighteenth one
here I think we've been this for about
six months now so pretty impressed with
how I've been able to keep this going
and that's due in large part to you guys
because you guys watch it and that's my
motivation to to want to keep doing this
I appreciate all of you who watch these
on Sunday night's Monday mornings but
every time it happens to be where you
live I do appreciate the time you've
taken out of your day or night to ask
questions and just have intriguing
conversations arguments whatever you
know happens in the live stream that's
all up in the air and that's what I like
because I never know what kinds of
questions I'm gonna get you know you
guys just ask me whatever you feel like
asking and a lot of it I have to do
research on you know just after this
because I don't know enough about some
of the topics you guys asked about but
that's great because ideas for future
videos so thank you Rory Feeny asked
would you recommend an ITX for first
build sure yeah I mean I don't you know
the build premise doesn't change right
you're just working typically with
smaller components i takes built they're
a little more difficult because usually
have to mind cable management a bit more
depending on the type of ITX case you
get like a you know h 200 i and that'll
be a pretty big beefy ITX case compared
to a fractal node 202 are some of the
silverstone cases out there so yeah it's
gonna depend it's definitely in a very
depending on the type of case that you
buy but for the most part you'll be fun
with that sure can you tell the RGB case
it has a round hundred fifty bucks
red chicken Bob there are plenty of
cases that are already
that are much cheaper than 150 bucks you
just you know scroll through Newegg most
cases are gonna have some sort of RGB on
them unless otherwise noted if they have
RGB they're gonna say they have our GB
so that's a good way to sift through it
Jakob bare-ass are you holding any
cryptocurrency absolutely not I don't
touch cryptocurrency I never have I
never mind
I've never traded it I just I don't do
that stuff I don't touch it it's
unregulated bs I just I don't trust the
market frankly at least in its current
state maverick and will you do knock
ture reviews I've already done a few I
think I've done in HD 15 that's that's
the one that always gets the you know
the credit right for being like a really
big beefy cooler that also stays really
really quiet and I actually have them
sending over a couple if actually more
than a couple of sets for some cool
theme builds we're gonna be using in the
studio so we'll be using I forget the
model there's so many different types of
fans that they make they're the ones
that are they're black and they have the
replacement little rubber corners right
the little I guess in common like shock
absorbers or whatever on the fans so you
can kind of customize the color accents
on those fans so I have them sending
over like four packs of those and not
only because they're they're black and
they're kind of interchangeable with the
color scheme but also because they're
super quiet because they're not shoot
fans so yeah I mean they're not like
this the most quiet fans that they make
the industrial-grade stuff but they'll
get the job done and they look pretty
good doing it
Joran I don't know anything about rumors
gtx 11 whatever I don't follow rumors I
don't dig through any of that crap
because most of its yes anyway it's it's
hard to kind of you know pinpoint the
stuff that actually might be true
because what people who share rumors try
to do and a lot of websites will do this
especially the ones that rely solely on
you know are almost solely on rumors to
gain traffic is they'll try to make the
rumor sound as believable as possible
you know and they'll do their best to
explain what this would mean in the real
world blah blah blah but it's all just a
hype game it's all it's it's trying to
drive traffic it's trying to be
shareable viral right and I just
not into that I used to be more
up-to-date about the rumors and stuff I
don't follow that anymore okay let's see
we have wood Johnny asked would you ever
be friends with a console plebe
white-hot I actually have a console that
doesn't mean that you know I play it I
mean I play like two games on that and
it's I don't play it as much as I
usually play the you know PCs I play
like pub G a ton on here I played GTA v
black ops 3 like some of the older
titles that I've just been like playing
since they came out but I I probably put
maybe two or three hours a week on
consoles that's that's about it I bought
it for Lisa just because it's it's more
of like a you can sit on the couch
together and play games and you know
it's it's more like personal kind of
like in-home type thing or as PC gaming
it's very like user oriented right like
you're in your space this is my space my
keyboard my mouse stay on your side of
the desk you know so it's a different
experience this is more competitive I
would say it's more intense
whereas console gaming is pretty lacks
and at least for us so that that's why
we have one but I guess we're kind of
console bleeps to the way we're both we
get the best and worst of both worlds we
have a question here from let's see 49er
pub G the answer is pub G ninja die I
can't play fortnight's - too cartoony it
looks like I'm playing a a video game on
my god I don't know it just it doesn't
it doesn't scream modern to me I just
don't like that style game I never have
I think that's more modern looking I
will usually jump into fairly quick okay
we are scrolling down - do you have the
crash bandicoot insane trilogy no and
the only reason why I don't is because
it just seems a little I don't know it
just it looks fine to me
and the original crash series was
awesome I'm just wondering like how much
different it is because I know it's just
a remake right of the first three games
like I could just play the original
three games like if all I'm paying for
like a 35 or 40 bucks or whatever their
char
for it is like the updated graphics then
I'll save that money and I'll just play
the originals because I think the
originals are I mean they're awesome
anyway they're the physics of the game
I'm used to all that stuff I don't know
if any of that's changed in the new
insane trilogy I just don't know so yeah
it's kind of a risk also I've noticed
that our little Crash Bandicoot thing is
not showing up where if he has then I
have not seen it yet I know a couple
people sent and say we had a super chat
I'm gonna scroll back up to that Bradley
Gilbert what's going on Bradley he put
that $1.99 super chat great videos
thoughts on GoPros is it worth it my
experienced GoPros is they're convenient
and under very specific circumstances
obviously like you're gonna mount
something kind of just click go live and
forget or whatever click record and
forget then yeah sure it's fine for that
stuff but you're just gonna be I think
you'll be disappointed even with the
newer stuff and and I've had hands-on
you know experiences with to the GoPro
Hero fives I can't really speak to the 6
but in my experience the sensors like
the sensors are really small so
low-light performance is not gonna be
that great the quality of the image is
always kind of just subpar to me I mean
I'm used to filming right on DSLRs on
mirrorless cameras and I like you know
if I see grain in an image it bothers me
a lot and I always see grain kind of
like distortion and GoPro footage that
I've ever taken on anything up to the
GoPro 5 so and that was the GoPro Hero 5
black I think it was the one that I had
I actually ended up selling mine because
I didn't use it a lot but if you're
always going on adventures doing cool
stuff then yeah sure I mean that could
probably be something that that uh that
you could look into I'm trying to figure
out let's see we have an alert box and
widget settings maybe I'm just not
seeing it but I'm pretty I thought we
had crash bandicoot showing up on here
anyway okay trucker bomb says I just now
got the notification for going live WTF
YouTube see trucker bomb by the way
thanks for sponsoring this is your third
month sponsor so it's a good-looking
battery it's gonna give them better than
get that green one the I think what
YouTube did and
kind of tries to experiment with is when
channels like mine go alive it's like a
lot of people winces in prime time you
know like people on a Sunday night or
Monday morning probably aren't gonna
feel like tuning into a random tech
tuber but I think what YouTube did was
probably wait to hold off on those
notifications until it saw the video
games in traction if nobody decided to
tune in to the live stream it must not
have been that interesting and then
YouTube won't waste the time sending out
notifications to people who are actually
you know subscribed and notified or at
least have that Bell notification icon
engage so I don't really know how your
YouTube does it but I have a feeling
it's all based on performance within the
first 30 minutes or so of the video you
know trying to gain that traction that
traffic that viral 'ti whatever you want
to call it so yeah anyway interesting
ways that they can do stuff okay captain
produce one hey Greg I bought the fantex
350 x case after watching your video but
I can't use the built-in RGB because it
doesn't work on my z 270 board with Asus
from Asus with or sync please help I
think the 350 X is addressable RGB so
you will unless your motherboard
supports addressable RGB switch seeing
as it was Z 270 I don't know if it will
then you're gonna have to either buy an
adapter which I'm not even sure when you
buy an adapter from from addressable to
non addressable you're gonna be able to
just plug and play I don't know for sure
worst case you have to keep it separate
but the fact that the case does have
onboard support for address ability
means that it's really only gonna come
sync with you know it's only it's only
gonna really sync up with the stuff
that's new and that's actually a good
point I never thought about that because
of the bill that I put in the system is
a newer build and it does have
addressable support and the motherboard
but you could always just you could
always just run them suffer I mean that
the functionality overall it's not gonna
be impacted as long as you keep the
settings the same just set your case to
whatever color scheme you want and then
you can adjust your in your you know
your import settings after the fact
that's that's probably as good as I can
tell you at this point I'm not sure
about the addressable versus not
addressable though
I see looks legit a seven says how are
you doing Greg I'm doing all right for
Sunday night I'm doing right a little
slow come on I'm still a little tired
today it was we were installing an
axle-back exhaust on the q 60 so we this
started raining like right in the middle
of it something had to wait to finish it
up and they torque those bolts on so
tight you know you just gotta like we
were taking like this huge rubber hammer
and just clipping the the side that the
ratchet so that we could loosen the
thing but that was that that was a big
part of what if what I was doing today
what he's busy with and my brother and
few others help us so Nate Nate's
watching the livestream ain't knows who
he is Nate helped us as well mr. Snowie
six any plans to do giveaways to your
subscribers yeah I wanna talk about
giveaways for a second say good point
the reason why we've we've not done many
major giveaways for one I feel like in
the past we've used them to grow the
channel I don't think there's anything
wrong with that it's an effective means
to grow the channel but the problem is
when you grow with that base of people
who are interested in usually only the
giveaway not necessarily your channel
because you're just drawing them in with
that product that you're giving away
then you don't get the retention rate
that you're probably looking for right
so if we gained fifty thousand subs from
one giveaway which would be that would
be a pretty high expectation then those
fifty thousand subs probably won't tune
in to many of the videos after that
giveaway video and on top of that they
might end up unsubscribing later on just
because they weren't into the content
they were just into the free stuff so
I'm I've more or less shifted my
mentality with giveaways to just to keep
the people who are already here who were
already kind of you know intertwine oh I
see the chat the the crash manicured
things working okay I don't know what I
was seeing before but I guess it's
working awesome and I'll get to you
Patrick I appreciate that but yeah I
think from now on it's gonna be kind of
like what I was talking about in that
video about how we're not gonna do
giveaways from our own channel via gleam
anymores whenever we team up with
partners or companies if they want to
use gleam fine I'm not gonna you know
protest against it but like we've done
giveaways on live streams before we're
just give away $50 gift cards to Amazon
whatever so that that's just a way for
us to give back to people who actually
you stay engaged you know the people
that go out of their way to watch the
live streams to watch the videos those
are the people I want to win giveaways
because they're the ones who have been
here for so long so we'll pick that up
again it's it's a little tough right now
with YouTube doing what it's doing you
know bending us over and not
recommending many videos in favor of the
large tech channel to have the traction
it's stuff it's all money it's all about
money for YouTube so we'll get it we'll
get it in soon I see Patrick Eaton
what's going for that $2 super chat
thank you my dude I won a 1440p monitor
32 inch 144 or 35 inch ultra wide 100
Hertz look I was ok with a hundred Hertz
until I kept switching between that and
165 which for all intents and purposes
say 144 so 144 looks to me world's
better than 100 Hertz and I know that
sounds super first-world like I sound
like a snob right now but anybody who's
gained on a 144 Hertz monitor going back
to anything under I would say 120 Hertz
is gonna notice and it's probably gonna
bug the heck out of you
so I would always go for the higher
refresh rate monitor honestly 32 inches
is pretty big you might want to drop the
size maybe to 27 inches or so like I
can't play on a big 32 inch monitor plus
I'm sitting 4 feet from it especially
when I'm playing first-person shooters
it's too much real estate to have to
cover this close up to the screen so
that's my experience with it but take
that for what you will ok I'm gonna
screw up a little bit I missed a few of
them
primal NIN's OS when the next gen
graphics cards are coming out I have no
idea I don't I talked about this a
little earlier to grow back in a live
stream if you wanna hear me talk more
about it Merc 305 how do you think the
i5 8400 is going to be how long do you
think it's going to be relevant I 580
400 I mean relevance is subjective like
if it can play your games fine and I
think it'll play games for the next
three or four years before you feel like
really needing the upgrade and that's
because you have six cores there the
overclock ability is another thing that
you're not gonna be able to take
advantage of but I still think I mean
the clock speeds are decent for what
they are and that's around AMD clock
speeds right it's still gonna be I would
say solid for what it is let's see
yeah captain produce if you can't figure
out how to plug them in it if that's
what I was saying if it's not supported
by your motherboard you're not gonna be
able to run them together so just run
them independent it's not gonna hurt
anything in the long run just set your
case LEDs to what you think they should
be set at and then just do everything
else in your motherboard and it's gonna
still look fine it's just one extra step
you've got to do someone said is it also
said that YouTube didn't notify you
about the livestream like I'm just kind
of like whatever at this point like
YouTube's comeback is whenever they can
no worries I appreciate you guys
watching anyway especially if you didn't
get notified you're just scrolling
through UTB see a live stream that's
awesome I appreciate that too
hi yeah the Excite am hiya well you ever
call the people who overpriced their
rigs and put it in a video then ask them
why it's really high-priced I've done
that before I've already done that in a
previous Craigslist video or I called
the people who were asking for these
insane prices and tried to get them to
rationalize you know they're they're
like thought process like why on earth
would you charge this much money for
this rig is basically whatever call ask
them for and I it's it's it's kind of
sketchy because you can't really do that
legally in in most states and so it's
it's something that you've got to be
really careful with and yeah it really
comes down to just like potential
litigation processes that could ensue if
I decided to do that and record those
people from those ads without their
knowledge
so yeah that's that's really about it I
just don't take the chance of getting
sued and and potentially rightfully so
sued because in some states it's illegal
to record a conversation without the
other person knowing that they're being
recorded so yeah there's that for you
unfortunately I know that would be super
entertaining but I want to be I want to
be around in a year how good is the AMD
prism stock cooler is a sufficient for
overclocking this from TL opaque I guess
I you say your name I'm using the prism
right now that's the RGB one right that
included that's included in the 2700 X
Box and I've been using it that's great
I've overclocked everything across the
board 4.2 gigahertz with a stock cooler
it's doing really well yeah so yeah you
could overclock it I mean it's not give
me the highest overclocks temps are
running a little high but it's actually
pretty pretty quiet for what it is it
looks great
me
a stock cooler so yeah I don't think you
need I think you can be fine with that
at first if you still decide you don't
like it later just buy something after
the fact but that's what I would say
vetrix yeah what's your favorite
processor overall you know recently yeah
I've been using personally ladies in
Hunter K that's in my personal rig right
now if you guys I'll have a video on
this soon but the rig that I always game
on is an age of 700 K the rig that I
always stream on this PC here this has a
2700 in it it had a 2700 X but I swapped
it out there Benjen they're essentially
the same cpu and just one has a lower
TDP I believe and I honestly can't
notice I can't tell them much of a
difference at all between both and they
have the same graphics card GTX 1070 ti
swapping between both it's very
difficult to notice a difference when
gaming and say pub G or GTA 5 or
streaming for that matter with the
proper settings and I use Nvidia you
know encoding I don't use CPU encoding
unless I'm playing a game it's really
graphics intensive so it's kind of a tie
I really like the 2700 I think it's
great value the 1700 is like 200 bucks
now that's insane value but I really
appreciate the the enhancements with
rise into rise in second gen whatever
you might call it and I think that
you'll see in this next build here that
I'm gonna that I'm working on this
custom loop I think I'm gonna go full
fledge and a and B for a while just so I
can get just a full kind of opinion
about the CPU as my daily driver versus
something I just occasionally use when
it's convenient but yeah it's gotta be
between those right now let's see yeah
we have the good stuff you guys are
asking good questions I appreciate that
I'm trying to be as quick with these as
possible so you guys feel like you're
like I'm actually doing you something
like doing a solid let's see dissidents
do open-back headphones make a big
difference in gaming like positional
audio I've used one headset it sounds
different but barely like I don't know I
I don't consider myself like a true
audiophile but I know what sounds good
and what does
when audio sounds compressed and crappy
the headset I don't remember the headset
I used but it was that style it was okay
I wouldn't pay more for it but that I
wouldn't pay more for that functionality
just because it to me it didn't feel or
didn't sound worth it that's just my
take on it okay here I'm looking at
gaming pieces guys going off to college
and selling his PC for tuition money
it's an i-5 within ten sixty and it's
being sold for five hundred Canadian
like 800 USD should I run Diagnostics
should you run Diagnostics that's a
weird question what do you mean should
you entertain the offer probably and if
in canadian dollars well yeah it's gonna
be a little more expensive up there as
far as I know for pretty much anything
so ain't it funny like you just cross
the border and then CPUs cost $100 more
across the board like that to me is
insane and I noticed that when when I go
to Germany to see Lisa I noticed there
her prices and some categories are
pretty respectable there they're similar
to ours like Ram was actually pretty
cheap and some parts of Germany and then
graphics cards were really expensive
motherboards are really expensive CPUs
were I don't know why CPUs in particular
super expensive I know you guys have the
VAT and stuff but CPUs are just good
gosh so and they're small and they're
not expensive relatively speaking to
ship so I don't know do you think GTX 10
series prices will continue to drop I
expect so until the market equilibrium
is reached right now we're at a point
where people are comfortable buying back
graphics cards now unless you guys
decide that you don't want to spend
whatever they're being priced at right
now to buy one then they're gonna keep
dropping but if a lot of you start
buying these cards now that the prices
are kind of back at MSRP which is not
where they should be at by the way they
should be lower than MSRP because
they've been out for over a year then
you know we might not have the prices
drop anymore it's all about supplying a
man if they notice that they're selling
like hotcakes at these prices why on
earth would they lower the prices
anymore I just haven't been following
the market close enough to be able to
tell you exactly what's going on but in
a nutshell that that is the the process
taking place under the table mst3k
it's gonna mind you fondle a super chat
recommendation for a case with two fans
in front with room for a DVD Drive and
glass side panel I know the one case
that comes to mind right away is the
fantex end though pro is it the FinTech
sento pro I'm pretty sure it's the end
of pro let me see
I got a Amazon this and though bro yeah
it's the Pro Am and they have the pro
tempered glass model so that's got like
four CD drives in it right the well no
not that's the anther Pro full on you
can get the enth Oprah mm tempered glass
case for a hundred bucks and that's got
tempered glass on the side it also has I
believe a DVD drive and it should
optical drive via the other one I had
did yeah it does so yeah that's the case
I would get if we recovered just ask
that mst3k how do we get the fan tech
center program tempered glass panel or
tempered glass Edition for 100 bucks I
think it's a good price that has an
optical drive bay in it and tempered
glass and doesn't look bad okay I know
we I missed a couple super chats and
they go back here real quick and get
these me knock these out folks here we
go okay I see trucker bomb I see you're
super chat I see the bait I ain't
falling for it could try them thanks for
supporting us by the way I know checker
bomb trucker bombs always here it's a
good question I would say the second one
because I see better commercials for the
second one so we only just stopped the
commercials the second one is the one I
would go for ok age think of that one
Internet super chat why do why don't you
post shirtless pics on insta anymore
because I am nothing that's a good
because I am nowhere near as big as I
used to be I send up a lot I used to
work out those who for those who didn't
watch the channel in the very very
beginning back when I started some meat
on my bones I was about coming out of
high school is about 130 130 pounds so
58 or so kilos whatever in my head
that's roughly what it is and then my
first year in college I went to it was a
Business School Troy University very
easy
you know relatively good day and then I
went to engineering school I was a lot
harder I actually had a really study for
some of those tests but I was kind of
just breezing through the business
classes and I was like now I want to do
something this is before I had the
YouTube channel it was like I'm gonna go
to the gym I went to the gym twice a day
every day for must have been five months
I was taking a protein shake all good
stuff
I was bolt up hard I think going out of
leaving school that year after the
second semester I weighed 155 I want to
say I put on 25 pounds of solid muscle
and that's what those old pics on my
Instagram you're seeing when I was like
jacked that's what that was and then
after that year I got an engineering
school I started doing YouTube I had
absolutely no time to work out
especially twice a day and I lost all
the muscles so I went back down to like
130 135 and I'm like five-nine five-ten
so and I'm not sure so I look skinny
because I'm not you know I'm not I don't
have a wider frame so yeah that that's
my my story of Fame 'dom or fan whatever
your fame yeah my story of Fame and then
I lost it all basically I just didn't
find it worth it to keep working out
that hard forcing myself to eat you know
drink to protein shakes a day and gorge
myself and meals wasn't worth it was too
much upkeep alright back to the tech
wills here for the shirtless pics he did
not super chat 100 bucks for that normal
evil Greg while I certainly understand
the if you guys purchase GPUs now
they'll skyrocket come about tomorrow
but won't the same happen with the 11 or
20 series launched yeah but the
difference is it's all about production
cycles right so usually when you produce
you know you have this new architecture
you started submitting these in the new
cards that you're rolling out for the
first time ever the production cycle is
totally different these companies these
companies expect when these new things
are released for them to be selling like
hotcakes
so they flood the market with inventory
typically we didn't see that with like a
Vegas 64 or 56 that was a little they
had to scale back that and I don't
really know the full extent of why those
prices never really leveled off to what
they should have been but most of the
time you have a new product you flood
the market with a product that you've
had in stock and that way you can keep
the prices stable that did not happen
with the 8700 K Intel was behind on
inventory and you saw the prices rise in
accordance with that because there
wasn't enough supply to meet the demand
so you raised prices that lowers demand
then you have another market equilibrium
but then once you get that inventory
back into cycle then you have more
supply and demands kind of the same so
you slide yourself down that supply
curve a little more and then you have a
lower market equilibrium price it's it's
difficult to swim out of graphs that you
get the point
and I have videos talking about supply
and demand of graphics cards and how the
prices are affected by outside sources
we think of that find out the super
Chapman dude what it what are your
favorite non tech YouTube channels I get
this question like almost every
livestream I answered this last time as
with Doug de Muro and I'm gonna say it
again cuz I just love dog I think Doug's
a really genuine dude just from what
I've seen what I've all the videos I've
watched I mean if he's not the way he is
in his videos he's a great actor like
you just get the feeling that Doug is
the same way on camera that he is off
and that's what I try to do too but you
know there's work another thing for me
we get really stressed out we don't
people to see a stressed out and stuff
like I can't picture dog getting
stressed out about anything and the way
he brings that just so eloquently to his
car reviews to me is just that's that's
a special gift and he's doing what he
loves
and he's doing it well and I'm happy for
him okay let's see here I am scrolling
uh-oh I see a couple good ones here I'll
get to you super Chad I see it
mmm okay okay what an i3 or i-5 Sandy
Bridge would be a good idea with a GT
1030 and an optic likes yeah depending
on what you want to do little Jim I
would say that yeah it's good your your
graphics cards gonna be bottleneck more
than likely money situation Sandy Bridge
is still viable I mean it's not like
you're gonna see maybe a 20% jump in
many games and from from a frame rate
perspective when you jump from Sandy
Bridge to say KB Laker or coffee lake
but that's not to say that they're not
good CPUs especially when you get them
on the cheap so I would never shine you
know Ivy Bridge era CPUs on this you
can't get them for a good price in which
case the avoided Allan Huntington
I think if that $5 super chat my dude
any reason not to buy Rison 2200 G over
the 1300 x2 the price is the same I
don't see a reason I enough we've had
this talk with Brian before on his live
streams that's a good point and no if I
had the choice between both and the you
know 1300 ex was the same price the
twenties I mean they're the exact same
right there the almost the exact same
CPU I would go the 2200 G just because
you do have integrated graphics and I'm
pretty solid integrated graphics at that
when you compare to something like the
Intel HD whatever 620 graphics or
whatever it's embedded in the modern
stuff now it's a good step in the right
direction and and I'm glad that AMD
actually rolled these CPUs out for the
for the people they're very
budget-conscious just want something
that's decent for you know HT pcs light
gaming MOBAs stuff like that horizon
2020 and the 24-degree are actually
really good for that stuff okay
opinions on a bachelor's computer
engineering it's tough computer
engineering is not easy I took a few
electronics classes in my and my degree
field whatever you wanna call it and the
most difficult stuff for me was all
about like AC nodal analyses stuff like
that like that's all pretty technical
I'm not sure how much of like computer
engineering overlaps with electrical
engineering you probably do a lot more
programming that would make sense to me
but in general it's gonna be more
difficult in my opinion than say like a
mechanical engineer because I can
picture a mechanical process is taking
place and that's what my degree kind of
my degree and mechanical are pretty
pretty similar but I can picture
mechanical processes taking place and
when I can picture something it's great
right okay I can understand it I can
explain it that's awesome
but electrical stuff I really can't
picture AC you know I can't picture a
see anything in my head you know we
start throwing trig in there it's just
like oh so that's that's been my
experience with it it's more difficult
than your average mecanim that's not
taking anything away from mechanical
just in my opinion from how easy
mechanical was for me which it still
wasn't you know super simple it was much
easier than the electrical stuff my
degree was in petroleum engineering
dahmer Oh
27 ah let's see I'm scrolling uh-oh
someone has Edward words how do you feel
about Madden coming back to PC where it
all started I am excited and can't wait
I you know I'm wondering I've never
played Madden like any NFL you know
college or whatever I've never played
any football game on a PC before so I
don't know like like do you have keys
really can you program like give hot
keys for certain plays or something like
how does that work I feel like it would
be totally different than playing on a
controller right of the console just
because you have so much more your
disposal and football is in large part
like a strategy like how you know what
kinds of plays your runs types of people
you throw it to stuff like that like I
feel like it's it's more dynamic and I
feel like PC fits that perfectly so
interesting I'll definitely try it out I
remember you know playing NC double-a
whatever college football back in
2012-2013 era when I was really big into
consoles and and that was uh that was
fun really was okay quí they say Chi Chi
whatever blader how do you do you like
pony cars
my mom has a Mustang GT like a 20 2017
or something like that 2016 it's a
really nice really nice car I actually
debated getting a Mustang instead of my
Q 60 but I I just I love forced
induction
I love the tunability associated with
forced induction and going with a
naturally aspirated v8 like my Audi was
I just I wanted something different I
wanted something I tuned in the long run
and and that's why I want the keys six
do you know twin turbos 400 horsepower
and a v6 that's it's fun so it's it's
fun to drive it's just there's the
traction is so bad I got to get stickier
wider tires let's see
Xbox or Playstation I have a playstation
playstation ps4 pro not that that was
like super excited over here's the pro
whatever like it looks the same to me
it's all consoles look totally different
than pcs to me the gaming experience
because you can do so much more with
PC's granted with much higher budgets
but still the up
they're kind of like what I was talking
about just now with naturally aspirated
v8 sand the you know tunability of
forced induction turbocharged and
supercharged cars you just get so much
more out of them for what they are
with pcs and I love that what's the
oldest GP you have on hand I have oh
crap
on hand I don't have much old I don't
have many old graphics cards usually I
throw those like cuz all the old ones I
have to buy myself right so I'll throw
those an old builds that I put together
from parts sourced on Craigslist and why
not and I'll usually just sell them for
a quick buck it's been a while since
I've done that just cuz it's it's it's
very time consuming and to have to meet
people and whatnot for just like often
as little as 50 bucks on like a trade or
a sale it's just kind of I don't know
it's it's difficult to focus more on
that and then on the channel because the
channels like that's my main source of
income so if I don't make videos on the
channel it's more impactful for me than
if I don't make you know use pcs to sell
online good question though okay we said
like what are your thoughts on g-force
now will Humphries I don't have wills
here but will uses g-force now all the
time and it's actually pretty responsive
I'm surprised the latency like is as
minimal as it is excuse me I expected no
he plays pub G on his MacBook with us
and he streams it totally from g-force
now and he's like in their beta program
or whatever and he tells me all the time
really it's it's not bad like he
actually does pretty well and certain
certain times sometimes he doesn't do
well I think it's more skill related
than anything sorry well but playing on
a MacBook is no easy feat and he makes
it work with especially with g-force now
so yeah I think it's promising I just
think that their subscription services
or how they're gonna charge people to
use the streaming service it's gonna be
really weird I don't really know the
full extent of it yet but interesting to
see roll out ml fez mil Finnell fez i
don't know how to say that do you think
we will get a boost in CPUs next year
similar to the GP what do you think of
rulers regarding the GTX 1080 I don't
rumors I think that's what you mean I
don't look at rumors I talked about that
earlier in the livestream let's all say
about that you can scroll back if you
wanna hear more about it but for CPU
jumping up in terms of IPC we see this
more with graphics cards I think because
graphics cards are designed for
different things
and the way that you design graphics
card architecture is very different I
mean parallelism is like the point right
of graphics cards why they have multiple
cores thousands of cores most of the
time and I mean even the ones that have
you know 36 or 48 CUDA cores 72 CUDA
cores 500 or so CUDA cores and then you
have some that have over 2000 CUDA cores
like that they are designed differently
and because their applications are wide
ranging whereas CPUs I mean they they
CPUs are just used for different things
it's really all I can say about that and
we come down the fabrication processes I
can tell you that if we could do more in
the time spans that we have only expect
new generations to roll out I'm sure we
would although I question like you know
when Intel makes a mmm questionable 4%
IPC jump from generation to generation
you got a wonder are they really trying
you know whereas an AMD kind of did a
similar thing from 12 to from 14 to 12
right from summit ridge to I want to say
Raven Ridge is that right 12 nanometer
1700 X 2700 X you know what I'm talking
about that jump was still pretty small
right the IPC jump is very minimal but
the differences between those two more
or less came down to like voltage
control overclocked ability RAM support
right with the Infinity fabric they were
fine-tuning all that stuff so a lot of
it really comes down to and it's it's
kind of user based it's it's it's it's
all based on certain case scenarios but
in general I think we still see jumps I
mean look it's taken Nvidia what two
years now coming on three years now to
roll out new architecture CPUs come out
every year so if you look at CPU jumps
every three years it might be a little
more equitable okay
scrolling up ROG Mir is the six here
it's monitor worth overclocking to 70 or
72 I mean yeah you can overclock it sure
it might run a little hotter but
monitors I mean you can overclock a
monitor like if you overclock a monitor
past a certain range that it supports
like let's say you overclock to 75
and it doesn't support 75 then you're
just gonna get a black screen and assume
you're using like the Nvidia control
panel you'll have to wait 15 seconds for
it to revert back to the 60 Hertz
refresh rate and it'll tell you that
it's out of range right or you monitor
might actually specifically say that and
that tells you that you can't go that
high so you just keep trial and error
encoder clocking until you get something
that's comfortable and there you go get
an overclock system right right right
right right so I don't have to say that
what are your thoughts on making gaming
a disorder because some countries make
it official I feel like if you make like
there are people who are truly obsessed
with video gaming
I don't think making it a disorder is a
smart idea from what I've seen I mean I
think they're probably you know
exceptions to this of course but when
you tell somebody that they have a
gaming disorder in my opinion that kind
of like enables them when you tell them
they have a problem then they feel like
it's okay to have that problem but to me
a gaming disorder is as easy to correct
is like you know to me that that's not
something that you should be able to
link to like a certain part of the brain
like functioning differently like
there's some kind of defect or whatever
to me it's it's just it enables kids if
you tell them that they're obsessed and
they can control it they can overcome it
like it's not you know it's it's not a
disorder it's just them choosing this
over this and it's not smart maybe
there's a chance that they won't have
that disorder you know in the first
place no no it's kind of a weird tricky
subject and some people get really
offended by stuff like that but I don't
think it's a disorder and there are
exceptions but that's about it
Hector how do you everybody what's going
on my dude mst3k is that I have a
youtube disorder I think we all have a
little bit of a YouTube disorder if
we're if you're watching this live
stream right now chances are you either
got a notification and you love the
channel and I appreciate that or -
you're here to troll me and I still kind
of appreciate that because you keep it
lively in here or three you were
scrolling randomly through YouTube and
you're like wow who's this guy science
studio and in which case there you go
example C so yeah thanks for being here
by the way you guys 236 W on a Sunday
night / Monday morning
you guys are awesome and also our like
to dislike ratio is not totally trash
like usually is it's probably gonna go
to trash now that I said that probably
should have avoided topic leo
Bittencourt
does overclock and without touching
voltages and with good temperatures
degrade hardware I mean degrade hardware
like hardware is gonna degrade anyway
over time I mean that runs a hot is
gonna naturally degrade but if you jump
voltages is gonna degrade faster to the
extent that that happens or occurs we
can't really quantify it because we
haven't had controlled scenarios for
that long to see CPUs blow up in general
CPUs don't die very quickly you'll have
a power supply die quicker in most cases
or a hard drive or even maybe a graphics
card before your CPU dies that's that's
a very very specific issue that I would
say and most the time isn't going to be
the issue itself okay potato genic
what's going on $3.99 super chet my dude
any experience with 3d physics
simulators ah not really no I hate to
just say no and move on but yeah I've
never anything involves programming
anything that's like programming to me
software engineering it's just it's a
totally different world and I I just
haven't been able to sit down long
enough to actually pick up on the the
cues right when it comes to coding and
whatever language you happen to be
coding and if it's just it stuff like
the closest thing to a 3d physics
simulator I ever used was universe
sandbox and I'll know if you will call
it a physics simulator but like it's an
unofficial green game type thing right
we can manipulate objects in space it's
actually really intuitive that's as
close as I've ever gotten to something
like that
let's see vetrix what's your favorite
game to benchmark GTA 5 is always my
favorite I've benchmark GTA 5 since I
started the channel and yeah that tells
you how young the channel is by
comparison but I just like the
consistency of it
I haven't noticed like huge improvements
like one whenever they roll out software
updates for the game right via Steam
whatever I don't notice like huge
performance jumps especially if I'm
using the exact same hardware and that's
that tells me it's a good thing and
tells me it was pretty optimized from
the start so those marginal improvements
really benefit the newer hardware
out of course they're always adding new
stuff to the online modes and whatnot so
it's just to me it's a consistent
benchmark it's reliable and it's very
easy to run and there's so many settings
you can change and manipulate this is
also pretty intuitive from that aspect
as well okay we all spell and you
Saturday
oh it says trucker Bob just said uses to
buy calendars he realizes Saturday I
seriously thought this was Sunday that
tells you how like crazy my days man I
can't believe this is a revelation this
is insane I went this whole I literally
started this livestream with the
expectation that it was Sunday I am so
out of it right now that is insane I I
feel embarrassed to an extent but the
same time I think it's really funny so
thanks for stopping by on a Saturday
night
this is not what it's supposed to be
maybe we'll still do a stream tomorrow
night I don't know but I totally went
into this thinking it was Sunday this is
super weird
Felipe can you say something concerning
your mic a blue Yeti and a cheaper one
so I use v2 Pro for this system I have a
b-1 behringer these are behringer mics
be one over there I have a Yamaha sound
board mg 10x you and that's good for
like I think four XLR inputs and then I
have a blue Yeti in the other room which
I use more or less for like you know
temporary sound recordings for videos
like my voiceover stuff and then I have
an 80/20 35 which is also it's similar
to a b2 I think the b2 sound better for
the price the HEA 2035 is a more it
sounds a little more dynamic but I like
that just the b2 sounds really warm and
I like you know especially when I get
very close to it which I'm usually about
two feet or so from it so be very close
it sounds crystal clear I love it
okay ah Shiro Excel Greg what are your
thoughts on the AOC 4k curved monitor I
don't even know what Mario you're
talking about but in general I don't
look at 4k monitors for gaming just
because I don't think they're worth it
I'm much more comfortable 214
or DP high refresh rate panel it's much
more affordable typically than the high
refresh rate 4k monitors that are
starting to make their way into the
market okay do you yawn in your sleep
good question Jeffy I don't that's
actually a really good question hmm
Jeff he's always told with good
questions I remember good question your
ass last time to Tamid easy what's the
best starter YouTube cam g7 g8 e5 from
Panasonic in that range I wouldn't spend
more than a thousand bucks like to me
you know if you're gonna jump full
fledged into YouTube without knowing if
your channel is actually gonna gain
traction or not then I wouldn't spend
you know thousands of dollars on
hardware like I see guys buying so much
expensive stuff like stuff that I don't
even have you know like I don't use the
most expensive thing I have is a sony
a7s - and I just bought that like for
the longest time I've been using the G
85 which is $1,000 camera before that I
had a Panasonic fz1000 which is like a
fixed lens variant of the g7 and then
before that I had a Nikon d50 100 okay
so I haven't had the most expensive
hardware the most up-to-date stuff but I
make it work I mean my light panels are
cheap I have those too in the film right
now they're just fluorescent panels I
don't have it you know $400 light kit or
whatever and I just I make it work you
know like it's not gonna give me the
best result I understand but I I make it
work given the limitations that I have
of the hardware I have on hand that's
just that's just my take on I don't
think you need super expensive stuff to
get quality content out there
okay scrolling down okay ps1 freak 26 my
GPU fan stops sometimes and get really
hot when it happens what do I do to oil
what do i what do I use to oil the fans
your fans stop and that's why is it an
old graphics card the fans sometimes
stop because they're newer cards and
they stop because you're not under heavy
loads so it's a way of keeping the
system very quiet until you get under an
immediate load but assuming that's not
what you're talking about if you have an
old card yeah I would just grease the
crap out of the fans the bearings I
don't know how else you could do that
you can't just buy a new shroud for it
so yeah I would just grease it just try
your best and then make sure you have
decent airflow from
the front of the case I presume hitting
that graphics card so it's able to push
it out alright okay hockey shots
thirteen do you like expensive shirts or
shoes I really don't have expensive
clothing I've never been one to buy you
know fifty dollar t-shirts and crap like
I don't even buy $50 jackets or $50
Cody's like I just I whenever I go to
like whenever I go shop like I'll go to
whatever JC Penney Kohl's whatever is
like mainstream here I don't shop very
much obviously you can tell it I always
try to go to like the discount racks
like I look for this definitely fifty to
eighty percent off and I like like this
shirt here cost me like four dollars
like I'll never buy a shirt like this
for 20 bucks that's never gonna happen
so I always try to not cut corners but
cut costs when it comes to clothing
because I'm not that like I I care more
about like how my car looks or like how
my pcs look versus how I look with
clothing cuz that's just to me that's
just to this is superficial in a way
that I'm not interested in I would more
I would I would save all the money that
would spend on shirts and stuff and
throw it into a nice kit for my car or
something like that's that's how I would
spend my money instead
so clothing yeah all right what's going
on lieutenant goldenrod how are you
doing my dude Edward Burt says have a
good night all thanks for stopping by
Edward I appreciate it Matt see and
all-caps question what do you think is
the best PC case for cooling for around
60 bucks for cooling I don't know I
don't do case review strictly from
cooling perspectives that's not really a
question for me I would say I mean I
have a video on the best $69 $59 case
you can check those videos out but from
a cooling aspect I don't I don't really
look at I mean you could get cases that
have just pure mesh up front
pure mesh up top you know like those are
gonna be decent cooling cases but I
don't run tests strictly from cooling
perspectives and based my entire review
around that it's just I'm not not that
other channels do that other channels
emphasize it way more than I do but I
look at cases more or less as a
functional piece from like the build
perspective how easy it is a cable
manage I weigh those more heavily than I
do air flow unless air flow is
absolutely terrible and then I'm like
by it I think by a case strictly for an
airflow perspective is that's like one
out of four variables that I would
consider personally although some people
base their whole purchasing decision
with cases on that one variable for me
it's about you know it's about cost
first off value second I would say it's
about aesthetics honestly I would just I
would pick a case just cuz it looked
good third I would say build ability
like how easy it is to build a net cable
managed what-have-you and then I would
say fourth is air flow and again unless
air flow is absolutely crap then it
becomes my first priority especially
with that case in mind then it would be
my fourth most important variable that's
just me and that's why I don't heavily
weight air flow like other channels do
just because it's not something I
personally care much about unless I'm
looking for like that optimal super cool
system okay see you pick Hannah I have a
2,700 X it freezes and then my PC won't
post until it randomly starts working
again after fiddling with things any
ideas what could be wrong do you hear
clicking sounds when it randomly starts
and stops you might be short-circuiting
it somewhere that's like the first thing
I think of when I read that comment it
could be a power supply issue could be
motherboard related it could be maybe if
you have extensions cable extensions
maybe you don't have a cable plugged in
new power supply correctly it's tough I
mean if the whole system is tripping and
turning off and on I would say that's
more or less a power related issue and
that could be a short-circuit it could
be your power supply itself I don't know
it's tough what's your wattage what's
your power supply wattage maybe maybe
you're not getting enough wattage to
your system that's tough okay I'm
scrolling down to the good stuff here we
go
buh-buh-buh-buh okay Oh custard
okay some of you guys are answering
questions for other people that's
awesome do my job for me thank you and
more input is necessary by the way like
I am one person so more opinions out
there give the potential buyer a wider
range of options to consider and that's
always good more options are
always better programmer what is the
cheapest a pro-gamer excuse me what is
the cheapest gaming computer setup for a
youtuber that's trying to grow please
help me budget up a thousand bucks gtx
1060 i five eighty four hundred or
Reisen five sixteen hundred twenty six
hundred in that range 500 watt power
supply 16 gigs of ram there you go
decent editing rig and gaming rig to
felipe i so he says what would you like
to come to germany i i've been germany
mun dude my wife lives in germany right
now hopefully that changes soon but i've
been to germany like four times i think
so
we'd like to go back yeah right now it's
really expensive tickets right now
they're seasonal right so if you try to
go to Europe in the summer it's
expensive it's like 2,000 to 2,500 bucks
for me to fly out of my city to
somewhere in Switzerland or Germany but
if Lisa flew here it's only like 600
euros I'm like what the heck
like it's a head flip-flops and then in
the summertime for for what some time
for us in the winter time for us in the
States and Europe concern the modern
hemisphere to one on the white side that
it's cheaper for me to fly to her so I
don't really know how it all works out
but whatever comes in waves it's
seasonal definitely seasonal holy water
have you been to Canada yes I have very
temporarily I've been to Canada twice
once was in Vancouver we took a crew an
Alaskan cruise out of there's this back
when I was 12 or 13 we took a cruise out
of Vancouver up to Alaska those are my
favorite vacations ever and then we also
went to Toronto near Toronto we if you
want to call Niagara Falls in near
Toronto we were in Canada temporarily
after after the Niagara Falls visit but
it wasn't very long not enough to see
all of Canada or whatever like that
qualifies as and then I was there for
some like community help work at one
point and that was actually right
outside of Toronto so yeah I've been a
Canada three times and my my take on
because I've been there twice in the
summer it gets pretty hot up there too
like I was surprised I expected it to be
cold do you think Canada you think oh
it's always snowing in can't
that ain't true first off and second off
it gets very hot it even gets humid in
the Toronto area and I did not expect
that at all I was sweating pretty hard
outside okay let's see here
I five twenty four hundred and gtx 660
system how much should i sell this for
if i include a 17 inch four by three
monitor keyboard and mouse that's tough
look i would go on ebay check out what
the i-5 24 is selling for i don't know
if the top of my head it's been a while
since I've dabbled in that gen so I
would check to see what the CPUs
themselves are selling for on eBay try
to price out your motherboard or
something close to it priced out of gtx
660 and then everything else in your
system power supply drive your keyboard
your mouse your monitor like those are
gonna be really cheap like you're almost
throwing those in this convenience
factor don't try to upsell your your
system by including a crappy monitor
that's just that's my take on it I don't
like it when people try to do that and
say here pay more for this because I've
thrown in this really cheap monitor you
could get brand new Walmart for 20 bucks
more so yeah I would just I would refer
to ebay or a use site like that to price
out your system if you aren't sure let's
see Krypton I get cheese can we all just
agree that he looks better with glasses
I the only reason the owners netbook
context of today was because I was
working outside but otherwise I usually
just wear glasses I used to be super
uncomfortable wearing him and and then I
got the the recent frames that I've been
wearing quite a bit for like the last
year or two and I felt a lot more
comfortable with those think they're
more modern the lenses I had before that
they're in a few videos they're like
long and narrow and rectangular and they
just look so bad so I got ones that look
a little more up-to-date you know a
little more hip and people can roll them
with it ever since I don't see anybody
complaining saying I look weird so
that's cool you know I always feel weird
when you try something else on but other
people especially the first time they've
seen you oh that's a normal look you
know they don't think much of it okay
scrolling up why does a round pizza come
in a square box
Jeffie again with another intriguing
question that is such a good question my
dude I don't even
I don't know it's a good question yeah
Brian did try that monitor experiment
and I am wander I have a feeling it
probably worked in a few cases I haven't
actually if he has a video uploaded
haven't seen it yet but I'm gonna I'm
gonna talk to him about that and see
because that's something I always notice
when we do the crisis videos here people
always try to bundle monitors and
peripherals and crap and try to chart
even more for it and I usually never
like when I buy a PC I'm buying a PC
like I expect like if I'm buying a used
system I expect it I'll have the monitor
you know like there for me at my house
or whatever I'll use a TV but most of
the time people include like I said
crappy monitors and to me if you're
gonna charge me more for something I
could get you know that something I
could buy better spend the money better
and get a nicer monitor than that one
then I would rather do that I just
realized that the crash bandicoot thing
is like getting chopped off whenever
somebody said something like fix that
there we go and then let's make it a
little bigger whoops whoops whoops alert
box there we go put it right gotta like
use the arrow keys to get this thing
centered up okay and oh there we go
that's good enough right why is this so
different
okay much better now I had a strain it
was very good I notice that it was being
covered by that the text log or whatever
what type of cooling would you recommend
for a time machine Steven double of zero
that's a really good question hmm I
don't know you'd have to use some sort
of oh that's like way beyond me dude
good try though what are your thoughts
on simracing they've been a Logitech G
920 racing wheel myself I've never I've
never liked the I've only used really
cheap wheels on so I don't know what the
morning was feeling we did do that one
vr sim game in Taiwan Jacob did it and
then I did it and it was interesting it
felt kind of real kind of like the real
deal but at the same time racing games
in general I've always never played with
controllers like I grew up playing
PlayStation the
PlayStation Gran Turismo that type of
stuff and I always use controllers
whether it be analog or that the digital
in a little scroll wheel digital
whatever you know you call it and I I
just I was I've been so used to playing
with that and using a real wheel for
those kinds of games when I know it's a
video game
I'm just not as good with that so yeah
it sounds really like cheesy and I don't
suck at driving that makes it sound like
I'm not a good driver but for the for
arcade racing and stuff I've always used
controllers and I'll probably still use
controllers for the foreseeable future
trucker bomb - Oh super chat my dude
2700 K or 67 okay with a 1080 TI worth
while upgrading the CPU nah no I mean
now if you don't see an immediate need
to upgrade I think 60 our case fine
scrolling down here to the good stuff
let's see here nice is that that's weird
okay we have what do you think about
where I am it's like 6:00 a.m. morning
and at you it's night so if it's 6:00
a.m. for you then you were in Europe I
presume
let's see I know that Lisa's 7 hours
ahead so 7 hours 17 5 a.m. so that means
you're slightly further east than
Germany so maybe you're in like the
Greece area off the top of my head I'm
thinking like around Greece I don't know
if like turkeys in the same time zone as
that but somewhere in that zone that's
what I would say would you trust a $210
gtx 1066 gig it's on ebay but yeah yeah
I mean it was probably I don't know if
it's that cheap maybe he just wants a
quick sale you know I remember my dad
wanted to sell via the suburban he sold
it for like in like I'm a week because
he just priced it so competitively and I
even want to deal with the haggle is if
you feel like just getting the money up
front is worth you know the cost cut
right that you're gonna give to the to
the buyer know then yeah it's just
difficult engage like I would check the
sellers reputa bility stuff like that
your eBay guaranteed right so if the
cards dead you can get your money back
it's gonna be a pain but but usually
you're fine okay here we go
oh thank you all twitch ESCA some
probably helped you in the comments
thank you guys for answering questions
and all the good stuff put your thumb in
the middle of your forehead and Rica
Minji what happens when a cpu with
integrated graphics and a build with
dedicated graphics meet I'm confused by
that question anybody get that if you
hear crickets okay 8600 K verse 8700 non
K 8700 9 K is still a really good cpu
unless you plan on overclocking your 86
in arcade like 5 gigahertz or 5.2 and he
primarily the game the 87 her case is
better bet thanks to you again hyper
threading until it Rison for gaming
intel's a better gamer hands down
Mitchell asked if I'm his dad it's not
probable it's not probable it's 7:00
a.m. here where am I 7 a.m. Oh Middle
East I'm totally using your name to like
group you into this like cluster of the
planet but III I would say somewhere
Saudi Arabia area possibly UAE I'm
thinking you're 9 hours ahead of me so
yeah that's enough that's what I would
say you're in that zone am i right am i
close
gotta be close how do I look scratch
from way too far down hold on a second
here I'm scrolling back up okay okay oh
I see okay here we go you should get the
arrow 15 instead oh that's a reference
to somebody else's question Greg is the
gtz 1090 TI boost to boost that sounds
so Jake oh my gosh here's a good one for
ball yeah Dow NZXT s340
elite versus aged 500 I assume you mean
the insects th 500 not the cooler master
H I fired that was like totally a dick
move I would say
I like the elite looks better I'd I
would just go with the elite just
because it's a case I'm more familiar
with and it's it's based on a very
reputable like internal design layout so
yeah let's see do you think Percy cx8
Corps would be possible
you mean 8 cores in a single CCX I'm
sure at some point I mean that's not the
case right now but I'm sure at some
point you probably cramp aid in there
they'd have to redesign it though and if
they linked anything via the Infinity
fabric then you would have you'd
probably change a lot more that's all
beyond me but yeah it's probably reason
why it's not the case right now because
that would of course reduce latency
right between cores so interesting
Jonathan Riggs will your wife ever move
to the US now we're just gonna live the
rest of our lives
she's planning on moving here of course
it's all paperwork and stuff the
government's she's from Germany so
that's good I mean we're on we're in
pretty good terms with Germany so
hopefully hopefully everything works out
we said the paper we're getting stuffs
we're just kind of waiting now uh
someone says Turkey is delicious I think
it's a reference to my to the country of
Turkey
Greg it's 11:00 a.m. where am i 11:00
a.m. oh gosh that's gonna be India India
timezone that's what I'm thinking
you got to be somewhere in India if I
called that yeah exactly I know you're
intimidated now you're like oh he knows
where I live okay I saw a couple super
chats he let me get to the Me's we have
a Raul Alba Bob Dallas super chat Monday
thank you currently on 46 wk want to
upgrade to threader for 1920 or Intel X
series 7820 X what would be your advice
78 20 X I would completely avoid the 78
20 X and here's why I'm just gonna I'm
gonna pull this up side I'm sure that I
don't mess it up okay so the 7e 820 X
you get eight core 16 threads right the
1920 X you get what is it 1920 X is uh
12 cores 12 cores
yeah okay right so you're looking at 8
cores and 12 quarters right my
my thing is unless you're doing some
serious programming work compiling where
you're gonna need those threads those
cores for gaming content creating you're
gonna be better off with a higher
clocked lower core countship
and at which point upgrading especially
from a 46 70 K and 8700 K would do great
good a 2700 X would do you great good I
would say if you're looking at like a 78
20x and you're sold on like an 8 core
CPU the 2700 X is a much better choice
in the 78 20 km/h 178 20 X I think those
two like those Intel x-series chips are
just so difficult to rationalize for
most people and same with thread Ripper
honestly like thread Ripper is priced
better by comparison but it's still and
it's a very niche CPU for a lot of
people that like watch this channel who
game who content create that's really
about it you know like I'm saying yeah
encoding any kind of coder will benefit
from the extra cores if you're doing
like virtual machines that's fine but
most people aren't doing that kind of
stuff on a daily basis so just take that
to heart save yourself some cash I'm
scrolling up again I missed one of the
super chair very quickly I'll get to you
guys excuse me trade Matthews $10 super
chat my dude thank you what should I
look for or change when getting and I a
pro what a pro proc hot limitation I've
never even seen that before
when all cores never get past 81 see in
front of me five I have Gila today seven
Arkady VC CSA or VC IO have separate
thermal monitors it's actually a good
question I don't think that to me that
doesn't seem like that's the issue
though if you can't get past anyone see
in prime 85 that sounds like a something
in your BIOS doing that but I don't
think that it's your VC CIO that's
strange
yeah your best bet there is gonna be
probably I feel bad because you do
something ten blocks but your best bet
for something very specific like that
because I've never run into that issue
it's even with that see like I have an
exact CPU in the system right here I
would say
yeah you're gonna have to dig through
some forms my dude and and just
troubleshoot the crap out of it and see
what you get I I don't know what else to
tell you that's very tough I apologize
and I'm not more help but that would
take a lot of diagnosing and a lot of
troubleshooting turning on stuff turning
off stuff switching through different
toggles in the BIOS spam rice spammer I
I see what you did there what is your
opinion on external water cooling setups
like having the radiators and stuff in a
separate box mount that to me it looks a
little quirky I've never like I don't
like systems that have like reservoirs
on the outsides of cases and stuff like
even if you have a separate unit for all
that stuff it just looks a little quirky
I don't know I like why would you do
that if you could have it all in one box
like to me I'm more about like keeping
things compact
can your Pepsi come here come here he's
on the ground he's trying to jump up she
just clawed the crap out of my leg if I
said if I randomly scream you know what
happened come here Pepsi go up here okay
here we go you see the good people you
see the good people she's okay yeah all
right she ain't having it
and she's gonna pull a cable from behind
the computer I'm gonna get lit oh jeez
captain produce one I think he says tell
me how do you connect RGB in the P to
the X by itself it's it's there are
cables running from the top header on
that in that case that you connect to
the headers running along the side RGB
strip right on the side of the case and
the power button and the front strips
you have to connect all those there's
probably a manual for how to do it but
it's it's the the connectors are already
in there connect those beforehand so you
don't get confused on which connector
does what and you should be fine my
streaming thing says I've only been live
for nine minutes and 45 seconds that's
very concerning okay we're gonna wrap
this one up soon folks
yeah Pepsi's she's pretty camera shy and
I'm glad you guys know her name that's
awesome enough you've your car like bet
this only that's funny too Pepsi just
because I don't know we just we were
thinking of a name or like this
something different like people name
their cats like so many like like oh
another person who named her cat this or
their dog this so I wanted to do
something a little different that's all
this was about let's see one or two more
questions
scrolling down I'm seeing some good
stuff upgraded from a GTX 1063 gig to a
1070 should I uninstall drivers and
reinstall in most cases no like I've
hot-swap cards and I've tested doing
like dd1 installs and reinstalling and
seeing there's a difference in
performance usually when you stay within
the same architecture same generation
and video is pretty smart and will
either you know reconfigure the software
to fit the card automatically plug and
play or you'll have to uninstall the
driver reinstall it make sure you don't
have conflicts but for the most part if
it's the the same driver will usually be
this you know you'll have the same
different for both cards as we're trying
to say so if you're on three nine one
point ten you know on a ten sixty if you
go from that to a 1070 you're probably
still gonna be on three nine 110 so just
yeah that that's my experience I haven't
noticed any performance degradation it's
just hot swapping but if you want to be
safe ddu it you know just play it safe
and you won't have any conflicts there
Greg what made you major in petroleum
engineering or some like Computer
Engineering
I talked about this earlier livestream
Computer Engineering just a little
beyond me
petroleum pays more on upfront on
average it's just a more niche thing and
I it's more mechanically based I
understand mechanical engineering better
I can visualize it and that's why I
chose it and it was really close to home
like Florida to Louisiana where I went
to schools it wasn't too bad and it was
very very cheap considering one of the
cheapest engineering degrees I could get
scrolling down something math u.s. if i
watch pam tree i don't even know what
that is dude inferno one seven four
moustache more beard my dude it's gotta
be it's gotta be a beard a moustache is
a very particular thing it looks good on
just a few people
very few people can pull off just a
mustache especially something as
ostentatious like a handlebar mustache
okay my name is chick donated $9.99 you
shorted me one penny I'm not gonna hold
it against you that I appreciate it even
if I don't agree with them your opinions
make me think from a different
perspective and I appreciate that keep
up the great work and that's that's
awesome that's exactly what I try to say
especially after a review or I do
implant a lot of my opinions I you know
I want people to disagree with me like
it's totally fine with me I just the
only thing like my pet peeve is when
people say like well this wasn't you
know you're wrong about this but I
bought it like very clearly it is the
case right like if I say something
that's straight off of a spec sheet you
know from their website or something
that I've literally experienced
firsthand on this machine and then
someone says that I'm wrong like that's
what I argue just because I'm trying to
defend myself but when it comes to a
penny in it opinionated stuff right like
if someone says I hate the super thin
bezels like who would say that but
whatever
I don't like super thin bezels and
laptops and I say that I do like I'm not
gonna tell you that you're wrong and
like you can't really do that with
opinions anyway that's kind of what I
like like it's a it's an open door to
argue but it's fair play because no
one's gonna win that argument right like
you're never gonna tell somebody that
know your opinions right my opinions
wrong you know unless it's strictly
factual-based
you know based on fact it's it's fun to
kind of pick people's brains make them
question their opinions right people
have opinions based on facts and that's
can't get around that
but people base their opinions too on
emotion on convenience and that's
something I try to get everybody that
least think about you know when I tell
you that I feel a certain way about
something I try to justify why I feel
that way
so if you don't originally feel that way
and maybe you're like oh that's true I
never thought about that before there
you go
you know it's the sharing of ideas
that's really all it is
Jeffie good week Jeff he's got another
one here here we go folks who say tuna
fish but we never say chicken bird mmm
this my mind is blown you guys Jeffy
over here Jeffy eight six nine six just
going to town I love these it's good
stuff keeps my brain active
that's right Adams Leith says sharing
opinions is how we learn something
different and test our knowledge well
said
Jeffy says no no Jeffy Jeff he says I
question my own opinions that's good too
I got a double check your own stance
it's like why do I believe this you know
then you can go back and assess your own
assumptions and preconceived notions
about products and there you go
Pepsi is trying to step on the keyboard
she's gonna end up canceling a live
stream or something
wizard courses Greg tell us a joke
please here's one the I 373 50k that's
that's my joke okay I'm moving on
trucker bomb says I hate super thin
bezels on phones negatively impacted
durability and that's more important
than looks in my opinion yeah see that I
can see that to an extent I think the
phones with thick bezels they look
absolutely horrid so from an aesthetic
standpoint I think is a huge trade-off
but if you're dropping your phone like
if that's your biggest concern is
dropping your phone then you should put
a big ol fat case on it at which point
you're gonna have thick bezels anyway so
I I don't know it's kind of a catch-22
okay we'll do a couple more two more
questions
Floyd Tennessee says hey Greg I'm
upgrading to the horizon 5 1600 and GTX
1066 paper when I 3 + RX 460 it's a good
upgrade and I have a vs 450 watt system
from Corsair so do I have to upgrade the
PSU - I would say at first glance no you
shouldn't have to you should stay within
450 easy even when overclocked if you
overbought both of your units you'd
still be within the 450 reads you might
not be in the most peak you know like
the peak part of your curve you might be
around 250 300 watts I might still be in
your curve I don't know but 450 is
plenty and a lot people think 450 is too
short like - you know it's not enough
450 is plenty for especially that
configure there ok
scrolling down let me make one more
question folks I need a good question
give me something to be give me the
juicy stuff wizard says Greg rate
yourself from 1 to 10 on the what and
which ones better wondered that
this what do you think of the gamer look
what do you mean gamer look I don't know
I don't know what you're talking about
like there let's see can you say
something against about microphones I
don't know what that I've never heard of
that brand thoughts on Mexico it's
actually a pretty beautiful country in
places that I mean other parts of Mexico
that aren't very pretty there are parts
of the US but aren't very pretty either
but when you know where to go in Mexico
it's a very beautiful country
Nvidia without g-sync or should I go
read I use in video without juicing all
the time
I like Nvidia software a bit better but
AMD might be the better value so if you
care more about value in that sense and
I think AMD makes more sense right 1080
versus 10 succour 1060 versus 580 all
right especially when you go eight gig
verse six gig 10 60s are still 300 350
bucks in some cases 580 s 8 gig cards
are going for 250 so yeah in the States
anyway so in my in that case I would go
with a 580
any day of the week even though I like
Nvidia software a bit more the 580 is a
way better deal at that point all right
one question one question here we go
here we go one more question ok I see
Tommy Mize question ultrawide monitor I
would go 34 40 with a 1080i 34 40 makes
more sense I mean they're both large
differences from 60 but 144 Hertz is a
much bigger difference give me the good
stuff folks and even one last question
here good question he would go any good
good to do something good potato genic
I'll answer that where do you want your
channel to be in one year I want to be
at least 500 K like I've been I've been
like trying to break this like get out
of this 300 K sub place and YouTube is
just like we were doing super well and
then your video stop getting recommended
you know people don't get your
notifications the channel slows down
it's really tough yeah it's got a churn
through it we're doing fine financially
we're doing okay
but you know the channel growth has
definitely slowed down so trying to get
to 500 K is gonna be tough next year but
that's where I want to be that's my goal
and cliff weathers I talked about
fortnight already already and earlier in
the live stream you can scroll back I
hate fortnight I think it's trash I
think it looks trash and okay one more I
know I keep saying one more here we go
see it's thread Ripper overkill for most
people John
it is overkill yes okay you go what do
you think about Logan Paul I don't watch
any of his content I've never even heard
of him until that Tokyo or the the
suicide forest scandal so if that tells
you anything there you go all right
folks one more round price is going down
ley Matthew Rand prices in the states
are already coming down so just give it
time I mean they're not gonna totally
level off within the next six months I
don't think that they're gonna continue
to graduate to gradually work their way
down so anyway we're gonna do one last
thing here
one last thing one last thing is
everyone comment with their favorite
emoji we do this after every live stream
we're just gonna spam the text the
chatbox here the little chat window you
guys are all gonna see it on the live
stream even if you're on a phone find a
way to get into the chat box and send me
your favorite emoji starting right now
spam it and we're gonna end live stream
when I'm satisfied and I say when I'm
satisfied so I want to see some good
stuff in there alright give me the good
emojis and I'll call you out I'll give
you the shout out whatever I can do and
we'll see if I can get there oh I see it
oh that one's good I see a bunch of them
whoo YouTube block that one cuz there
were so many emojis in it but I'm I'm
blocking it cuz I'm a boss
look in there what's up PAX Bros I see
you Wes Wes yo Jen
yo gender how do you say that an
interesting name inferno sceva scab
affair oh I see Alex David I see trucker
bomb is it a peanut trucker bomb mattias
