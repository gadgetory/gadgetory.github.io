subjects for a lot of people and for a
number of reasons we deal with it Aztec
two-person virtually every time we show
the application process what's the best
method for applying what's the best
compound for said application did you
use too much of the compound too little
everyone has an opinion and even after
independent validation and revalidation
by members of the tech community it
always seems like someone somewhere else
emerges with different results and that
just adds to the mass hysteria so in
this video we're gonna answer a very
simple question with perhaps one of the
most rudimentary testing techniques
we've ever done on the channel this is
thermal Grizzly's carbonate thermal Pat
infused with carbon tubes designed to
transfer heat efficiently and
effectively from the heat source to the
heat sink thermal grizzly claims
mid-range thermal paste performance so
we'll be sure to put that to the test
now the company also boasts over the
pads ability to be reused and left in
systems for indefinite amounts of time
without risk of composition breakdown or
expansion both of which tend to eat into
the performance of typical say mx4 paste
so it seems promising it might be no no
a little too good to be true
so what you're looking at here is the
pad and this is it like it honestly
feels like a little microfiber cleaning
cloth although it's probably a bit
rougher than that it's just it's
extremely thin and flexible in fact the
thinner the better in this case roman
spoke of a bit of it at CES this year
and emphasized the companies plan to get
this sheet as thin as possible you can
see it's already pretty thin but it
could be thinner and that would be good
from a conductivity standpoint you see
on paper this thing has a conductivity
rating of 60 2.5 watts per meter Kelvin
obviously the higher that conductivity
rating is it means it can pull more
energy from said surface at a given
temperature that brings this awfully
close to something like conduct a night
which is thermal Grizzly's liquid metal
solution it's a great compound if you're
in 2d living or you know optimal
performance it's a bit messy it's kind
of hard to keep up with you can check
out more of that in this video right
here but if you're worried about
something that lasts a long time and
really can be moved from system to
system it's not dirty at all it's
actually a very clean application
process then this might be for you we're
gonna find out though what exactly makes
this special so this point you might be
thinking this is the holy grail of
thermal solutions this little flappy
thing right here it's flexible
long-lasting highly conductive both
electrically and thermally so don't put
this over anything electrically
conductive however back to the thickness
of the sheet while thermal conductivity
is extremely high in this market space
carbonate pads are still quite thick by
comparison consider this when you apply
thermal paste and smoosh a cooler atop
CPU that paste is spread extremely thin
there's a lot of tension there heat much
prefers metal over paste as a medium
meaning a bottleneck and almost any
system is in fact the thermal compound
which is why some direct die solutions
exist to eliminate one point of an
efficiency between the IHS and the die
but anyway real quick back to the
connectivity of this and the thickness
if you have something that's extremely
conductive thermally conductive like
this sixty two point five is really high
but its thickness is gonna counteract
that just a bit we end up with kind of a
happy medium that's what we have here
now shoroma and this team could have
made this thinner this pad could have
been half as thick as it is now and it's
very difficult you can imagine to slice
something even thinner than this so it
would perform better but the pad might
last as long at which point why would
you use this over something else that
you know is tried and true so that's
when they came back to the whole
long-lasting approach you want this
thing to last a lifetime
theoretically this should never break
down I mean its carbon you know try
melting carbon let me know how that goes
so yeah theoretically you could plot
these things into run-of-the-mill
systems like I would say like school
computers this would be a great
application for and you can let them run
in there for decades you've never have
to worry about replacing them whereas in
the case of thermal paste like this as a
solution breaks down with time the
interface becomes less efficient and the
CPU in question runs hotter
that's why systems tend to run hotter
over time this is usually the first sign
that something's going wrong so carbon
up pads are made to be reusable they're
made to last a long time and that I
think is the biggest selling point of
this material in fact I think I'm gonna
start using these from now on because
this saves me the time of having to
clean up the thermal paste and reapply I
mean this can be a very consistent
approach right so if I want to test
coolers like if I want to switch between
one and another there's different ways
to apply thermal paste maybe I put a
little more at one point than another
you don't want those small variations
and using something like this would be a
lot better because it keeps things
rather standardized so from my
perspective this is a great just kind of
way to keep things constant at least
when it comes to the thermal interface
between the IIHS and the cooler that's
just my take but for just in pcs in
general if you're just looking for a
solid solution I think this is gonna be
it now that said we got numbers to talk
about and we're gonna see just how well
this performs to some stock thermal
compound I'm just calling the stock
because it's not special by any means
and x4 is decent pace but it's not gonna
perform as good as cryo not which will
cost obviously a bit more as well we're
gonna see how this fares see if thermo
because these claims hold true that this
indeed does perform about as well as
your run-of-the-mill thermal compound
now our tests can't possibly speak to
the longevity of the pad though the
principles make sense we decided in this
video to test just the temperature
claims made by thermal grizzly roaming
claims
low to mid range then we'll pace
performance as I just said when it comes
to thermals so in my eyes it made sense
to compare the pads to stock thermal
compounds found underneath box coolers
like the AMD Wraith cooler they're a
spire even the Wraith stealth as well as
common solutions like the arc AMX flood
and flashing
here and there you'll also find thermal
grisly stone cryo solution which is also
right in front of me and this is more or
less a high-performing thermal paste and
it won't cure with times that's really
the selling point here is it's not gonna
get all crusty and whatnot the
composition of it is actually highly
intriguing I'd like to know a little
more about what they use to prevent it
from curing but maybe that's a trade
secret now the software I use to pull
these numbers was I 264 engineer
stressed aspects included the CPU FPU
cache and memory which while external is
still an important and heavily utilized
aspect of any modern chips that's why I
included memory stressing the CPU used
was the Rison 520 600 X which I feel is
indicative of a growing number of gamers
and streamers on the market AMD's
perspective and performance in the CPU
space has been spectacular lately and it
always feels to me like Intel gets all
the love when it comes to testing
components and cooling solutions so yeah
here's one for AMD there is however just
one catch to all of this and it has to
do with the carbon on pads
I must confess I didn't know this going
into it I thought the pad would be a
little bigger and we'd have to cut it
down to size but thermal Bursley plans
to sell different sized pads depending
on your application so in this case I
have a 32 by 32 millimeter pad basically
the size of an Intel desktop IHS
something like the 8700 K or 6400 if you
want to go back to few generations the
recommended size for rise and CPUs
though is 38 by 38 which them obviously
sells as a separate SKU however all I
had in hand were Intel samples so yeah
as you can see here corners of the rise
in heat spreader aren't being covered
you technically want to cover all of
this for optimal performance so our car
were not pad ran at a slight
disadvantage
that's just want you to keep that in
mind like it's it's not performing as
good as it could maybe a 1 or 2 degree
Delta the what you're gonna see on
screen but still I think you'll be
impressed by this so our rise in 520 600
X was overclocked across all 6 cores to
4 gigahertz with a 100 millivolt offset
from stock the BIOS fan curve was set to
max rpm to eliminate potential
compensation when temps reached certain
levels this way all scenarios
experienced the same level essentially
of cooling throughout the Vernon's so
despite our setback regarding IHS
coverage with Pad solution we actually
ended up with nearly identical peak core
temperatures in the case of the pad and
Arctic MX
or thermal paste 88 degrees Celsius
verse 87 this could be chalked up to you
know application variation or even
slight differences as a diode level
which measures temperatures directly in
the diets the method we were using in
nighted 64 I double and triple-checked
mx4 coverage when removing the cooler
between runs by the way to make sure
there was nothing inherently wrong with
the way I was applying thermal paste
there's always somebody complaining
about the application I just do one long
line from top to bottom and it tends to
spread rather evenly you can also see
how stock AMD paste fared quite well by
comparison only a single degree hotter
than the pad and two degrees hotter than
mx4 lastly the cryo solution which
thermal grizzly claims is an excellent
paste for overclockers and enthusiast in
general performs only slightly better
than MX for at 85 degrees and while I
expected a slightly wider margin it
should be noted that this first off
doesn't cure which is good and it should
also be noted that we're using the stock
cooler here and and while for digger's
doesn't seem like a super stellar
overclock by any means our CPU in
particular was decently stubborn when it
came to voltage so I imagine as things
get hotter and the coolers TDP is
exceeded I mean this is a 95 watt cooler
with a 95 watt chips so it's on the
brink already a new weak link is exposed
and the temperature gaps tend to close
which is what we saw here but back to
carbonate am i impressed yeah absolutely
the idea that you know like a thin sheet
of what's essentially carbon and that's
what this is can cool an overclocked CPU
is still a bit mind-blowing to me I've
never worked with any thermal pad like
this apart from the ones that you would
use to cool the RMS and you know vram
modules and whatnot but I've never used
something like this over a CPU and this
still just seems so like pseudoscience
to me I still don't understand exactly
how it works I mean I understand in
principle but just thinking about the
fact that this is between my CPU cooler
and my CPU it just kind of scares me a
little bit still even though I've seen
the numbers I've seen how effective this
is it just seems so weird I shouldn't
have been applying paste for years but
back to the application I feel like
that's the the selling point of this
right here the ease of use you literally
have to just lay this on top of the IHS
like you're tucking in your cpu from
bedtime right sandwich the cooler and
you're good to go like it's mess
free its reusable its long-lasting and
comparable in performance to some
popular thermal solutions like Amex for
I love this stuff so much they actually
intend to use only carbon on the future
for at least my in-house testing as long
as it's all consistent and constant I'm
fine with that
it makes switching coolers super easy
and clean in my case I can build and
rebuild systems and simply reuse this
thing right here this floppy little
piece of carbon it won't cost much more
than typical compounds it won't break
down over time you can in theory use
this thing over and over again I mean
that in and of itself is pretty
incredible
it's a worthy investment in my book and
another option for those more concerned
with peace of mind than extreme
performance you guys liked this video or
maybe just liked the product let me know
by giving us one of thumbs up I do
appreciate I think Roman and me therm
grizzly team did a great job with this
and we should see it on sale pretty soon
actually think you can buy it in a few
places already I will link those places
down below along with the other stuff
we've tested here you can buy em x4 and
Amazon a new wagon pretty sure as well
as cryo not solution so keep your eyes
out for all of those and just a quick
note too on the variations I'm sure
you'll see other people or you've
already seen other people test these
other solutions you're gonna get
different temperatures it's gonna depend
on the system being used on the cooler
being used the overclocks bio settings
it's all going to change just a little
bit so don't hold my numbers perfectly
true all the time the one thing I did
want to do is make sure that this room
was at a constant ambient temperature
all the time so that from you know
solution to solution that there's not a
big temperature Delta we want everything
as consistent as possible obviously to
narrow down only the variables that we
really care about and in this case it
was just thermal compounds thumbs up
again if you liked the video thumbs down
for the obstacle guy red subscribe but
if you haven't already stay tuned for
more content like this and I was gonna
say something else totally forgot was
gonna oh yea become a member if you want
to be want to be super fancy become a
member it's like five bucks a month eeeh
special emojis and stuff anyway I'll let
you go you guys have been awesome this
is science video thanks for watching
