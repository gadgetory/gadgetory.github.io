checking us out friction when I move my
hand across my other hand I am feeling
friction why because these two surfaces
my palms are not completely smooth when
one moves over the other feels a drag it
feels a resistance a tendency to want to
move against the direction that I'm
sliding my hand across the other
friction is one of the reasons why your
core engine only performs at 25% of its
full potential a lot of that energy that
is stored inside the gas molecules that
are eventually burned to move the
cylinder down and thus turn your car
wheels ends up being lost in the form of
heat friction is also what can start a
fire if you take two sticks and rub them
together vigorously for long enough
periods of time you can get charred wood
and it forms because the motion between
the two objects in question is so great
so much heat is produced as a charcoal
actually ignites it can become flammable
people have been creating fire this way
for thousands of years they have been
able to harness and manipulate friction
to the point of where they can produce
viable flame now there are generally two
types of friction the first is static
friction and that occurs when an object
is resting of another but does not slide
down as you would expect it to because
friction is too great a kinetic friction
occurs when static friction coefficient
is overcome and the object in question
is able to slide down the surface
there's still friction involved but it's
not enough friction to prevent the
object itself from moving and
so static friction kinetic friction
theoretically at any angle other than
zero degrees this pen would slide but
because friction is present in
everything this does not move downslope
until it hits certain points this book
is a simple analogy it's nothing too
complex but at least now you get the
idea
of the differences between the different
types of friction that you see in
everyday life hint hint
the next minute science episode Earth's
structure soon to come thanks for
checking us out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
