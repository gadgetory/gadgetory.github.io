and like always that means deals now to
be completely honest and transparent
these videos never really do very well
with international audiences since Black
Friday is inherently in American
tradition and kind of dumb one at that
so most of us tech youtubers create
these in hopes that we can score you
Affiliate points via the links below
when you buy anything you buy an
affiliate link the host receives a small
kickback usually no more than about
three percent in exchange for bringing
buyers to sellers the buyer by the way
pays nothing extra and that revenue does
help us out quite a bit here at science
studio the support is appreciated so
today I'm recommending my five favorite
deals for the week of Thanksgiving
across both Amazon and Newegg
marketplaces this video is brought to
you by cable Maude and daring their
Black Friday so you can pick up an
entire kit of cables for your next PC
bill bet the sweet price of 4990 these
typically sell for a hundred bucks or
more so don't wait you'll get the 24 pin
8 pin eps multiple VGA SATA and molex
connections you guys know how this works
all in one bundle just make sure you
pick the kit that corresponds to your
modular power supply these are fully
sleeve kits so you'll need to plug these
directly into your unit click the link
below and transform your build into a
work of art so before we get started you
should know that I've had hands-on
experience with literally all of these
products I'm recommending or these
derivatives of them and feel pretty bad
if I told you to buy something that
absolutely sucked and there's quite a
bit of crap out there also I'm not being
paid by any company to promote any of
the products you're about to see these
are my honest picks based on the prices
I found over the week so what absolutely
doesn't suck is this 500 gig Samsung 860
Evo SSD these traps kappa at around 500
megabytes per second for both reads and
writes and that's a night and day
difference over any hard disk drive on
the market thanks to 3d stacked flash
cells these drives are fast efficient
and dense I recommend the 500 gig
variant for more conventional builds
coming in at around 73 bucks on Amazon
or the one terabyte varying for just
over 130 check it out via the link below
my second pick for Black Friday are
these nighthawk ddr4 modules from team
I am a big fan of this company the
products they produce and while we've
all been victims of price-fixing one way
or another we can also look forward to
price reductions as lawsuits and court
orders play out in 2015 I would not have
even remotely come close to calling a 16
gig hit of RAM a deal at 120 bucks but
considering what we've had to deal with
recently
I'd say 120 bucks is a pretty sweet deal
for a fast kit like this so 200
megahertz is great especially for rising
CPUs whose infinity fabric dependencies
are tied directly to RAM timings and
frequencies I've used this exact kit
actually multiple times in the past and
even reviewed its RGB capabilities in
this video right here just keep in mind
that these modules now support several
third-party RGB suites so customizing is
very easy up next is my new graphics
card of choice we've showcased several
used cards on the channel at killer
prices but if you're more of a peace of
mind kind of guy or gal you'll be
delighted to find the C vga gtx 1070 for
the win for just over 300 bucks on a new
egg these cards typically retail for
around $400 only rarely overlapping with
cheaper GT X 1080 variants I've got
several Nvidia cards from EVGA here some
of which I've bought with my own money
and I've never had a problem with
loudness thermals or performance from
any of them for the wind cards by the
way are among the best in the business
and GTX and studies in general are still
excellent perfectly viable graphics
cards for 1080 and 1440p gameplay my
fourth pick for Black Friday is the
horizon 5 1600 from AMD by the way you
can interchange this with the 2600 in
some cases it just really depends on
where you look in my opinion the
hexa-core horizon variants are the best
value CPUs on the market as a filming
the Rison 5 1600 is being sold on nuoc
for a hundred and thirty bucks which
absolutely crushes equivalently priced
Intel offerings including the core i3
8300 this is in the core i3 territory
and AMD is wiping the floor with them
here makes no sense in my opinion to buy
a core i3 when you can buy this you'll
get three times as many threads solid
overclocks and access to affordable
motherboards just mind your RAM
selection I'd go again with the team
group modules I recommended a bit
earlier and to play it a bit safer if
you wanted you'll be able to enable X
and P and attain slightly higher clocks
with second gen horizon processors like
Rison 526 hundred I'll leak both down
below my fifth and final pick for the
holidays is the pic Co px 2 7-6 I've
reviewed the HDR variant in this video
right here and I've got to say I was
very impressed with the quality control
and affordability of such a great gaming
panel from a company I've really never
heard of save one other time I reviewed
a cheaper product at 1440p in 144 Hertz
you can bet this thing will be super
crispy and smooth ghosting is an issue
thanks to the 1 millisecond response
time and 27 inches is my opinion the
perfect size for most gamers the only
reason I'm not sporting any behind me is
because I actually nicked the screen of
my review sample when I moved from a
little format to this one so hopefully I
can get a couple in the future for a
dual monitor setup the bezels by the way
aren't too fat so it should work out
quite well and that's all for this one
these are my top 5 Black Friday picks
for 2018 be sure to check in stores as
well for any additional deals
I'm sure Micro Center will be bumpin as
well as Best Buy and others but more
importantly stay safe you can't enjoy
your tech if you're dead or close to
dead so just protect yourselves out
