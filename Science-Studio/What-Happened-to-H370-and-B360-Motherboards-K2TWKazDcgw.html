boards valid question we've been milking
Z 370 for several months now since it's
the only thing out there currently from
modern Intel CPUs but the issue for the
blue team has been this no one wants to
pair a cheaper budget oriented Intel
offering with a Z 370 chipset sure Z
series chipsets are stacked with
features but for that matter so are
there H series counterparts in fact one
of the only differences in most cases is
overclock ability think KZ for Intel
Killzone I don't know come up with your
own acronym K series CPUs with Z series
motherboards period all other SKUs
should be paired in my opinion with H
and B boards so where are they
first up the boards in particular we're
discussing in this video are the
supposed to H 370 and B 360 motherboards
falling back to skylake the naming
scheme is gone H 1 7 th 270 and now
Coffee Lake H 374 the business lineup be
150 be 250 and B 3 which should be 50
but had to jump to 60 since AMD already
ripped to be 350 chipset there's also a
supposed h3 10 ships at coming its root
name stemming from skylake as well the H
110 chipset that's a lot of names but
way you should know is that the delay in
these launches has hindered Intel sales
of locked SKUs namely the 8780 480 100
no one wants to spend more money than
they must especially if one of the
board's main features is overclocking
impossible with non case cues save a few
exceptions with skylake more on that
right here so what's taking them so long
and big reasons had to do with power
consumption according to a few Intel
reps the jump in core counts across all
models have rendered previous gen Z 270
boards inadequate from power delivery
stand points in particular the VR and
the non die management systems created
long term instabilities early on the
testing phase with vendors so in certain
scenario systems would crash an account
of an adequate voltage regulation of the
mainboard level and it appears as though
this was because intel relied heavily on
previous gen cable a architecture to
push the coffee lake launch capable
excuse have lower core counts and power
consumptions across the board which is
why Z 270 required a few tweaks to Z 370
and this would also explain why Z 370
will likely be succeeded by Z 390 later
this year essentially a proper revision
what it should have been I can't point
to any leak to document to confirm this
I doubt any Intel rep would admit it
anyway but it's my belief based on the
research I've done personally that Intel
push Z 370 as a quick and dirty response
to AMD's release of horizons and goes
for X to 99 and thread Ripper I talked
with Steve from gamers Nexus a bit
earlier who had similar suspicions I'm
quoting him now it is the understanding
of gamers Nexus that the Intel launch
date for its Z 370 platform along with
the launch date of X 299 was pulled in
to be earlier than initially intended
our understanding is that X 2 9 9 got
moved forward earlier by around three
weeks in a Z 370 got moved forward by an
indeterminate amount of time we don't
have an exact explanation for why the
times were moved but one could
reasonably assume that X 299 was moved
forward to snipe thread Ripper and that
Z 370 was moved forward to either one
catch the end of year 2017 holiday sales
and the platform was prepared to go or
to limit the window that rise in one
remain highly competitive this was shown
by pushing the 80 600 K and 80 400 early
as they competed directly Steve also
went on to point out that Intel had very
limited stock of the 8700 K when it
initially launched quarter year four so
in a sense Intel rushed to have these
items on the market sooner than
anticipated in order to combat the
extreme competitiveness of the rise in
lineup it's pretty cool to be able to
say that the underdog at this time was
able to rush the blue team giant into a
premature launch that at least is what
the information at hand suggests so in
conclusion H 370 and V 360 chipsets
aren't late see 370 was just early on
account of Intel's forced hand when
should we see these lower grade chipsets
on the market though expect some time in
late March or early April of this year
maybe then some of us can start
recommending budget oriented systems
with coffee-like CPUs
but for now particularly would be 350
motherboards taken into account horizons
value still reigned supreme in my book
we'll see after April or so if my
opinion changes I'd like to thank Steve
for confirming my story and making this
video possible if it wasn't for him
kind of validating my suspicions I
wouldn't have had the guts to release
this video because a lot of it is kind
of just making your own conclusions
based on what we do know and it's just
it's just kind of funny in my opinion to
see Intel have to rush something because
AMD was so successful at launch by the
way if you like this video maybe like
the story let me know about giving this
one thumbs up I appreciate that thumbs
down for the opposite subscribe to
gamers Nexus if you haven't already I
don't know why you wouldn't be
subscribed to them but I'm sure to do
that via the link in this video's
description stay tuned for more content
