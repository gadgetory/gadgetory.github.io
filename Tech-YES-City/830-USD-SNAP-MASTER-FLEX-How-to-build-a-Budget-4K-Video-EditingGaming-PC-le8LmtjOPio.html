have seen some of the videos getting
spiced up looking really fancy and that
is big thanks to him right there and his
name is Yousef and here's the newer
video editor or at least the assistant
editor that helps edit videos here on
the channel attack your city but we're
going to be building him a monster 4k
video editing read today and it's all
gonna be done out of the hustle and
we've been doing this for a few months
now getting some parts together that are
really good and the best value for money
though when it comes to 4k video editing
so let's take a look at what we got here
on the table and put this thing together
and see how it does with Adobe Premiere
Pro
today's video is brought to you by
asrock with their H 370 performance
motherboards if you're in the market for
an 8th gen Intel CPU even an i7 this
board has you covered with the 10 phase
vrm design you can even control things
like RGB fans and other components via
the polychrome RGB software which you
can use in both the BIOS and windows
click on the link in the description
below to learn more so now here on the
table we've got all the parts laid out
and we're gonna go quickly through the
prices of each of these sabertooth
motherboard x79 we picked this up on a
deal with a 39 60 X and also 32
gigabytes of ddr3 HyperX memory we got
this for 300 Aussie dollars I'll put the
US pricing up there as well for you
folks over in the promised land of the
US of A here we've got a EVGA 1000 watt
power supply this year we got this in a
pro-rata deal for 700 Australian dollars
with like 4 RX 5 70s another 2 pcs and
another Corsair power supply so this if
it was the pro-rata at be around 80
Aussie dollars through this palace why
fully modules well came with the cables
and then we've got this here you may
have seen this on the parts on gtx 980
got this for 250 or z dollars then we've
got this here a 3 terabyte drive pick
this up for 2000 and then here we've got
a samsung 500 gigabyte evo drive got
this for a hundred ozzie and then we've
got this case back here raven this was
picked up for 60 ozzie dollars very
unique case very interesting as well
comes with two 180 milf anne's at the
front so it's a very unique case to say
the least
and then lastly here we've got on the
table is the vtg water cooler 240 mil
you can get these off i'll express their
relative ailable but we did get this on
a sale for a little over 40 USD a while
ago so with all that aside let's put
this epic PC together and of course give
it some tech yes loving cuz the case is
a little bit dirty some of these parts
could use a bit of a shine up as well
and then see what the final product
looks like
so we've just finished this in the nick
of time this is snap master flex has got
RGB control and the RGB really brings
this thing to life uses over the moon
with his new build
he's really loving it we've got the blue
LED ring fans at the front even the
drive cage will light up with its own
separate compartment at the front too
and this case actually surprises me it's
inverted but it looks really nice and I
think it's time now to overclock this
thing and see what it's capable of so
I'm now just starting to overclock this
thing and it is snappy like already I
mean I meant just might be placebo okay
I know but we've got at the 4.4
gigahertz first time overclocking this
as well and I'm just going by memory and
4.4 gigahertz at one point two four volt
at least under load so the settings I'm
locking in here are reasonably good for
an overclock we're going to go for a 4.5
gigahertz overclock now hopefully
four-point-six them just try and boost
it to four point six since the
temperatures are really well controlled
not even hitting 60 degrees under a
stress test and it's just 22 degrees
ambient in here as well so these Zeon's
are looking like they are just the
absolute cream of the crop knowing
they're unlocked and they're eight cores
16 threads on ddr3 x79 but they're also
like the best in terms of their voltages
for their clock speeds so let's try for
that 4.6 so after a little more tweaking
I managed to get it to 4.5 gigahertz I
did boot in at 4.6 however it does crash
a little bit so I have to look at
whether it needs a better cooler but at
the same time I think that 240 mill vtg
cooler is really good value for money
and it's handling it at the sweet spot
that's for sure which looks like it
seems to be about four point four to
four point five gigahertz after that
diminishing returns really does kick in
a lot but this Xeon is running so well
scoring about 1,600 Cinebench score and
a little sneak preview as well compared
to the 8700 k with the Adobe Premiere
Pro render times it's scoring in
practically identical
so this Xeon is really kicking it and
there's still some benefits of x79 as
well even versus the latest and greatest
Z 370 platform stay tuned for those
videos they will be delayed
unfortunately because I want to get part
2 of the giveaway for the kids done
before I leave overseas and also I have
to have to get some other content done
as well so Youssef will be enjoying this
computer will be his new editing rig
that we will get some more videos done
on the two and if it's that good you
just may see me trying to get another
duplicate of this rig and switch my main
over to some use price-performance
goodness and i hope you guys enjoyed
this one if you did be sure to hit that
like button let me know in the comment
section below if you have any questions
about the 1680 V - sure it does cost a
bit of money that CPU we picked it up
for about 350 us delivered which comes
in pretty much the same process in 8700
k the the ddr3 memory in the egg 79
boards if you're on your game can be had
for so cheap and that's what we've done
in this case we've got the X 89
motherboard and the ddr3 memory for an
absolute bargain and it's what's really
making this deal come to life anyway
guys I'll catch you in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
