release there is a new comparison and
today is the ultimate x4 70 motherboard
showdown with three different boards
here on the line we've got here the
crosshair seven from Zeus we've also got
the gaming seven Wi-Fi from Oris and
then on the left we've got the Taichi
ultimate from asrock all three of these
boards I'm gonna say straight away
they're all really solid of course they
all come in at a premium price we'll
talk about the prices related to the
features a little bit later but today
we're gonna go through all the things
like Auto overclocking VRM temperatures
em to shields and I see speeds USB 3
speeds and even the audio and the
crosstalk and also the noise related to
that so let's find out which motherboard
is the best for you
welcome back to take your city first up
we have the crosshair seven and this has
a ten plus two phase power design I our
three five five five sixty and power
stages on the MOSFETs also they have
micro alloy 60 amp chokes Zeus claims
these do better than other chokes of
course it's not that important when it
comes to air and water overclocking but
for the capacitors they're using 10k
nichkhun capacitors then we move over to
the gigabyte horas that's using again a
ten plus two phase power design however
in the middle of the phases that put the
two SOC phases because they believe that
separates the heat on the vrm with the
four phases at the top and then the two
phases being in the middle of the six
phases down the bottom being directed to
the CPU they're also using 40 amp ir35
5/3 power stages for the MOSFETs 60 amp
chokes and then 10 km each econ
capacitors moving over to the Azeroth
this is a 16 phase power design 12 plus
4 got four phases which essentially are
doubled then we've got 12 phases using
textures in cements next fetes and
MOSFETs these are rated at 40 amps each
chokes are 60 amps and they've got 12 KH
con capacitors so asrock are
implementing in on paper what seems to
be the most solid vrm however in
practice when we look at what a 4.2
gigahertz overclock does on water we can
see that's using up a hundred amps these
boards are rated for like 400 amps plus
so you can see just how much overkill
all three of these motherboards have on
the vrm design they will have eight plus
four pin power connectors however you
really only need to use eight pin on
your standard water and air overclocks
even if four pin might just do you find
those speaking of Auto overclocking a
big question that gets asked here a lot
on the channel when it comes to
selecting a motherboard if you buy one
of these motherboards is it gonna be
able to do a better auto IC than the
others well the crosshair has an auto
four gigahertz overclock and after I
tried this I realized that the 2700 X
actually Onix xfr technology boosted
higher than this thing did out of the
box so on water if I've got a hate 1/10
for instance it was going over 4
gigahertz anyway so if you are into auto
overclocking all three of these boards
will score relatively the same
but because the order overclocking on
the 2700 X is actually quite good this
time around and that's got to do with
AMD programming the CPUs relative to the
motherboards themselves and of course
how cool your CPU runs now you can have
the best vrm in the world if the cooling
design for that vrm isn't any good then
you could see overheating in the real
world especially in a stuffy case with
no airflow but I was happy to report
that all three of these designs were
doing a phenomenal job of staying pretty
cool on a 4.2 gigahertz overclock the
max I saw on all three boards was under
70 degrees I think Zeus edged out with
one degree better than the other two
solutions so they're all coming
relatively close but I will give props
to gigabyte and their fin design on the
heatsink
I really saw a difference with the
thermo camp you could see that the heat
was dispersed really well across this
vrm heatsink design so there's one thing
the old-school fin design is definitely
worthy of coming back on the motherboard
VRM I love it when companies say hey
even though this may be not looking as
good aesthetically it's gonna do a
better job in functionality and that's
exactly what this heatsink here from
gigabyte is doing even though it doesn't
really make a difference in the real
world you could probably run all these
VRMs without a heatsink
at all at 4.2 gigahertz but it's still
one of those things that's just
attention to detail though these
motherboards being as expensive as they
are one must wonder about audio and if
you've got a good pair of headphones
what can you expect out of all three of
these motherboards moving on to cross
talk it's important because we're not
isolate these two motherboards here the
crosshair 7 and also the asrock Taichi
ultimate they had really good crosstalk
however that was below a volume level of
91 soon as you up the volume over 91 it
introduces some slight leakage into the
right channels I don't know exactly why
this is happening I just know it's
happening so for the best listening
experience you'll want to leave your
volume under 90 on these two
motherboards the gigabyte one in the
middle this is an interesting kettle of
fish as well because when we had the
audio plugged in the rear output I
couldn't get anything out of it it was a
little bit buggy so I had to depend on
the front audio output on this
motherboard however there was really low
crosstalk going down levels of Nemo
- 90 dB same for these other two
solutions here one thing to note with
the Gigabyte the volume level was a
little bit lackluster even with the
headphone amp level three I was sort of
a little bit not used to this because I
know in the past gigabyte have
implemented some really heavy headphone
amps on their motherboards and that has
really given a lot extra volume level
this time around the volume level is a
little bit lower as opposed to the other
two boards of course all three of them
are scoring really well on the frequency
response curves I was just shocked again
as I said in the Tai Chi ultimate review
if you want to check that out
independently I'll put the link up here
the frequency response goes is the best
I've ever seen it's like onboard audio
just keeps getting better all three of
these boards had such a tight range I
think it was like minus 2 decibels below
10 Hertz after 10 Hertz
there was no drop-off at all so if you
love sub bass you're gonna get a really
good experience depending up your
headphones of course with all three of
these motherboards so what about the mic
inputs well the Zeus and also the asrock
I believe they're using noise
suppression all the way up to 30 DB plus
a hundred volume there was no noise
coming in the Gigabyte had the option to
switch noise suppression on and off when
we switched it off the sweet spot was 50
volume plus 20 DB this is a level I
recommend using if you want your voice
to sound natural especially if you have
a decent microphone if you've got a real
tinny microphone and you just want to
play games then maybe just turn noise
suppression on smash the volume up and
then everyone can hear you easily so now
we're gonna go through the BIOS feature
set and also other features on the
motherboard this might take a little
while because all three of these
motherboards are feature packed first
off we're going to look at the M 2 slots
nvme m dot 2 x4 gen 3 the azouz board
has 2 of these onboard so yes you can do
raid 0 nvme across gen 3 if you wish to
this is going directly to the CPU itself
rather than going via the gen 2 chipset
this is important if you want to get the
maximum speeds possible and you want
raid 0 across a scratch drive for
example if you're editing videos
absolutely phenomenal speeds the other 2
boards they have only Gen 2 on one of
the slots and Gen
three on another and the gigabyte makes
a big statement of saying it's ratable
but there's I don't really see a point
in especially doing a raid zero for
example maybe doing a raid ones okay but
doing a raid 0 with a Gen 2 slot is
really just gonna have your speeds
especially if you feel like a Samsung
Eva for example that can go up to around
3 gigabytes per second transfers so the
asrock is similar as well it's got a Gen
2 slot and you've got a gen 3 slots so
azusa definitely leading the charge in
this one because you can select the
speeds to take it down - Jen - if you
wish to on the nvme device so it's great
to see that as OOOs are innovating here
but this time around gigabyte also have
two heat shields on their nvme drives I
think that's what I'd like to see a Zeus
do since they do have the two Gen 3
options but all three of these devices
have the heat shields that actually work
when I tested the temperatures there was
a significant drop when we were using
the heat shields both on the
thermal-imaging camera and also in the
thermo sensor on the actual software
itself so we saw drops indicative of
that of 20 degrees + across all three
devices they do spread the heat quite
well again you only get one heatsink
with the Zeus model and the asrock model
but you do get two heat sinks with the
Gigabyte model which is props to them
especially in the case of a Zeus because
they've got two gen three slots I'd like
to see two heat sinks on the Zeus model
in particular so now if you want sick of
this x4 70 comparison already then you
may be getting sick of it right now
because we're gonna talk about all the
little gritties on these boards in
particular and first of all the fan
headers you get eight fan headers on
both the Zeus and the gigabyte models
the asrock only has five fan headers
that are PWM controlled so I would like
to see them especially on their flagship
board add more fan headers as I know a
lot of people nowadays are building
computers with literally like 6 plus
fans and they're all RGB so it is good
to see that control on the motherboard
itself you don't have to go through any
controllers so if it's one thing to
continue about the asrock what I would
like to see a few more you do get power
and reset buttons on all three of these
models the gigabyte for some reason has
decided to go with that power button on
the actual IO shield itself on the rear
interesting move personally I like to
see it on the model board
it's more of a testbed feature I mean if
you've got this installed in a build
you're gonna have that power button
installed to the motherboard anyway
though what we're seeing on the rear of
the board here is IO shields that are
already attached pre attached to the
Xu's crosshair and also the gaming seven
the as Mark doesn't have this feature I
personally do really like it I think
it's a very cool addition especially to
a flagship board so I would like to see
as well add this on in terms of rear
input and output they all come in pretty
similar the asrock tide she does get
separated from the other two which have
10 USB slots on the back also a type C
and also their dual band wireless 2.4
gigahertz and five units across all
three models now the antennas are quite
different
the azouz in the gigabyte model have
their stand-up detachable antennas the
asrock includes the two antennas that
just directly attached to the slots
themselves all three boards have clear
CMOS on the back and the Taichi ultimate
has a ten gigabit solution Nick
installed now if you do go with the
normal types you will get two extra USB
slots so the one thing that is limiting
the Taichi ultimate as it only has seven
standard USB slots on the back and of
course that type C as opposed to the
other models which happen ten also
testing out USB three speeds across all
three devices is absolutely fine and
testing out the one gigabit per second
Nick speeds were great and the kit 10
gigabit Nick speed from asrock was
absolutely fine - so they're all
delivering consistent performance across
the board whether it be the vrm the
audio or the functionality of the board
itself they're moving deeper into the
BIOS which is an important thing if you
are into overclocking all three of these
boards have their own unique biases I
will give the edge to the Zeus model
however I do believe it's absolutely
feature-packed
and if it's one thing when it comes to
extreme overclocking a lot of people use
the Zeus motherboards every time I go to
an overclocking competition
it's just laid out with crosshair boards
so I guess that does speak lengths to
the BIOS features that azouz implement
though for standard air and water
overclocking you've again got more than
enough in these three boards if I had to
critique gigabyte I'd like to see them
implement all the features you need for
overclocking in one different tab it's
one thing that azuz and
as rock do quite well there's also the
ability to control fan speeds and of
course update your boss on the asrock
from the internet within these this for
some reason does it automatically if
you've got an internet connection
plugged in it'll just start updating
your bias and so all three of these
boards have dual bias implemented
gigabyte has a switch for it so you can
change the bias if you wish to manually
or you can change it to have dual bar
supported from the get-go moving through
the inputs and outputs on the mother
bore themselves they all have
addressable three pin RGB headers as
well as four pin RGB headers if you wish
to use those they've all got three 16x
slots and two one-speed slots if you
need PCIe connectivity
there's also 3.1 USB 3 outputs on all
three of these boards as well of course
USB three out now on to the most
important part of a motherboard ladies
and gentlemen and that is RGB if you
don't have RGB on your motherboard well
unfortunately I don't even know if you
could overclock or not the all jokes
aside all three of these boards have
addressable RGB you can control that
within the BIOS or windows itself via
all three of their apps however I will
give the edge to the gaming seven I just
think this thing looks gorgeous I love
the way they've implemented the RGB from
the board itself around the PCIe slots
and also the RAM DIMM slots themselves
but speaking of the RAM DIMM slots I did
forget to mention that they've all got
two phases dedicated to ram overclocking
and I didn't find a difference between
overclocking on all three boards I also
did test the 2700 out as opposed to the
nan X because I will have a video of
that upcoming later and they all scored
4.2 gigahertz absolutely fine so that
was good to see there was no real
difference between these three
motherboards when it came to max
overclocking so now here we are at
conclusion time and a big question I get
asked all the time with motherboard
comparisons is which one of these three
boards would I buy personally and that
all depends of course on the price they
all actually have different prices and
different features that differentiate
them so let's start off with the Zeus
crosshair formula seven first this is
299 u.s. dollars in Australia four
hundred and sixty nine dollars so I
would like to see that Australian price
at least a PPP terms come down a little
bit but what you get for this money is
of course the Ducks nuts of motherboards
it's got everything that
want from a motherboard of course you've
got that dual nvme you've got a very
solid vrm design a BIOS that's
absolutely gorgeous
and one thing I didn't talk about before
was the Xu's grid option that's enabled
in the BIOS and if you've got this
enabled as soon as you install Windows
it'll pop up and say hey do you want to
get the latest drivers installed so it's
very handy and it's a great innovation
it's things like this that I notice and
they are going in the right direction in
terms of overclock ability onboard audio
everything this thing is a complete
package and it's got the address of blah
GB - I couldn't ask for more from a
motherboard phenomenal job of Zeus so
now we're moving on to the gaming seven
Wi-Fi and this is coming in a lot
cheaper than the crosshair so it's
coming at 237 bucks and in my opinion it
offers the best aesthetic out of all
three designs of course you do get those
orange accents they may not be for
everyone but that comes with the orange
LED lighting out of the box and as I
said before I think it looks absolutely
gorgeous heatsink design I think it's a
step in the right direction even though
some people think it's going a step
backwards I would rather the cost of
aesthetics for the increase in
performance if that makes any sense and
in this time around I think the
aesthetic actually looks gorgeous on
this board anyway of course VR and
design phenomenal BIOS could use a
little bit of tweaking onboard audio is
really good but keep in mind I did come
into a little bit of a problem where I
had to use the front audio out if I was
a headphone user or speakers that needed
amp from the motherboard themselves so
do keep that in mind though in terms of
everything else it's only got a gen 3 X
4 it's only got one of those on the nvme
so even though it says readable the
bottom slot is Gen 2 so other than that
absolutely phenomenal board this one is
definitely hitting hard for the price
and now the last solution on the table
here is the asrock tachi ultimate this
comes in at 299 US dollars in Australia
there's actually no pricing at the
moment but this is a solution that you
get if you need on board tanki bits per
second
Nick's solution though as I said in the
dedicated review which I'll put a link
up here if you do need to get to a
second Nick solution that I sort of
suggests grabbing one of those dedicated
PCIe add-in cards and then porting that
over from build to build I believe this
would be a lot more efficient because
there is the tai chi regular version
which comes in $70 cheap off and has
pretty much the same feature set and in
the Stratos 339 Australian dollars you
do get two extra USB ports on the tai
chi regular two of course big thing
about this motherboard 12 plus for phase
power design it's huge it's a monster
it's really good the boss feature sets
really good onboard audio is phenomenal
however it doesn't have an i/o shield
like the other two automatically
implemented from the get-go it's
something that I do like personally and
I'd like to see asrock follow the trend
of these other two here and follow that
and implement it into their own
motherboards anyway when it comes down
to all three of these boards are
absolutely phenomenal of course they are
expensive that's one thing to keep in
mind they do include the story my
license technology too but they all are
going a step in the right direction in
my opinion I could see myself using any
of these boards in my main rig I'd have
absolutely no qualms with any three of
them of course you probably wondering
where's the MSI board MSI I mean if you
know pick up pick up the phone send me
some text back I don't know what's going
on there but yeah I'd love to have their
motherboard on the bench here to do a
four-way comparison for you guys but as
it stands can recommend all three of
these options in terms of the feature
set just watch the whole review and see
which one best fits your needs
as that at the end of the day is what
it's about which one is best for you
hope you enjoyed today's review if you
did the be sure to hit that like button
if you have any questions or comments
about any three of these boards be sure
to drop a comment in the comment section
below I'll catch you in another tech
video very soon these out for now bye
thing about a motherboard and that is
RGB if you don't have RGB well I don't
even know if you can overclock because
the gigabyte this is where but what
we're seeing with these where is that
however there was really croak really
croak I a 3/3 yeah thank you
is it as it only has seven</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
