where I'm going to be either pitting two
products against one another or two
settings
against one another to see which gives
the best performance for gaming so this
is 120 Hertz is going to have frame
latency it's going to have various tests
and I hope you guys enjoy it so today
first off we're going to have the ni CE
to the router to the modem versus the ni
C straight to the modem and we're going
to see if it makes a difference now
today I am using a relatively cheap
router it's a $50 router and we're going
to see if it makes a difference so let's
get on to the results so jumping
straight into the results we have on the
left here no router with the speed test
and on the right here another speed test
with the router so head-to-head deep
pings
is I want you to ask to pay attention to
the pings here because we managed to get
0 milliseconds and that's no lie that's
no we've got 0 milliseconds
with no router and 3 milliseconds with
the router so I'm going to give the
pings or the fastest pings - no router
simply plugging your ni C straight into
the modem and you know three
milliseconds isn't much but it is still
a slight edge to the no router now it's
important to note that the download
speeds were also significant I'm going
to say significantly faster and the
upload speeds could be ever so slightly
put down to variance due to this being
done first this test being done with no
router first so I'm going to give the
edge to on the spit on the pings I'm
going to give the edge to no router
let's move on now to the results in the
frame latency tests ok so moving on to
the frame latency test now we see that
with no router this was done on black
ops 2 with 80-second runs across six
different Maps and I just did as you
know as made it as sort of action-packed
as possible and also did this with low
settings on the GPU and the graphics no
shadows and 120 Hertz art with vertical
sync enable because I wanted to get the
smoothest frame times without putting
stress on the GPU or the CPU and now I
want because I wanted to see how the
the internet playing in an Internet
environment affected the variables of no
rather versus router so we see here no
router on the six tests we did here the
maximum frame latency that we recorded
was 19 milliseconds and the second-worst
below that was 213 millisecond response
times so I thought actually 413
millisecond response times but I thought
overall it did pretty well as we see in
this frame here router number 3 it just
performed really solid in that first I
guess 30 second batch and then after
that did a little little micro stutter
so I thought it performed really well
the no router and it's actually no
coincidence so let's contrast this to
the rent results with the router and I
just think it's no coincidence that the
no router versus the router the router
scored the highest frame here was 22
milliseconds which is exactly 3
milliseconds above no router and
especially with my tests that I did with
speed test it was 3 milliseconds slower
as well so I think overall I'm going to
conclude that the router gives you a 3
millisecond delay in some instances
where Internet data is needed to I guess
processed the game or process the next
you know frame in the game so that's all
I can think of I mean I'd have to do
more tests on definitely do a lot more
tests with this because it is you know
it's I'm opening up a new world of
testing here but I think that the
ultimately I think that the know router
is just ever so slightly better and in
conclusion I'm going to say that it
doesn't really make that much of a
difference honestly like for the average
gamer you guys aren't going to notice
this difference however I'm going to say
though if you're a really competitive
gamer especially a competitive FPS gamer
then 3 milliseconds could technically
matter and if it's the difference
between you getting second place or
first place then you know that's that
slight competitive edge anyway guys I'm
really interested to test on the next
episode I'm going to be testing the N I
see on board n IC versus the external
pci-express ni see from Intel so I'm
going to be packing these head dad I'm
also going to be testing the real tech
sorry no the killer ni C software and
does that make any difference so I look
forward to seeing you guys next week and
if you enjoyed this please give it a
thumbs up if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment in the
comment section below and I'll get back
to you as soon as I can anyway guys
peace out for now
