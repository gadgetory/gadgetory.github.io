you've already freaked out you're like
Brian what is going on this is tech yes
City I usually never see builds above
$1,000 and let me explain let me tell
you the story we've got here a verizon
thread Ripper we've got a loan sample
sent in from AMD this is the 1950 X
absolutely incredible 16 cos 32 threads
cougar sent over this lovely case this
is their flagship conquer and then of
course I have the 1080 Ti
I've got some other parts gigabyte sent
over there or a7 gaming motherboard and
I thought we're gonna put together one
massive build that is just gonna conquer
the world come on we all knew that
punch-out was coming welcome back to
tech yo city this is brian coming to you
guys today with a $3,700 build I believe
this is the most expensive build I've
ever done on the channel if you're in
Australia the good news is that it's an
extra $1,500 over that u.s. price so
5,280 Australian dollars now getting
straight into the parts this build is
centered around this puppy here Rison
thread Ripper 16 cores
32 threads absolute behemoth you can
overclock this thing I've also got a
review coming for a very shortly where
compare it against the 7900 ex but
basically what you need to know is this
thing is designed for a workstation when
those applications can utilize those 16
cores 32 threads then this thing will
indeed do what the name states it will
rip the threads thread Ripper is here to
stay it is a beast for productivity
though for the gram scale we're going
with the NVIDIA GTX 10 atti this is the
MSI Juke
variant I absolutely love it's my
favorite variant of all 1080 T eyes it
looks very sleek it's really quiet and
it performs really well too for memory
we've got 64 gigabytes for 16 gigabyte
sticks from Corsair Vengeance led memory
on a motherboard from Oris this is the
gaming 7 and this thing is literally lit
it looks amazing with the LEDs that
actually matched the case theme that we
using today with the orange and black
and then of course powering all these
components is the C Sonic focus gold 750
watt powers play C Sonic makes some of
the best power suppliers in the business
this is modular as well fully modular so
you only use the cables that you need it
really takes away from all the clutter
inside the case and really gives you a
clean looking build with all black
cables too and for storage we've got a
960 gigabyte Corsair Neutron xti and for
backup we've got a 3 terabyte Western
Digital blue now generally if you aren't
hooking into a network attached storage
then you probably will want more storage
on top of what I'm putting in this build
here today and then for cooling the 1950
X we're going with the H 100 IV to cool
and out of the box this thing will
support
Rison so what you have to do is take off
the original bracket include it in the
box with the H 100 a and then take the
bracket that's included with the risin
thread ripper and then replace that and
then mount it onto your motherboard and
you should be having happy days though
this whole time I've been talking your
eyes have probably been wandering to the
left of me or to the right of you
depending on how you look at it and this
is the Cougar conquer this is their
flagship case 300 us it is expensive but
it is just amazing to work with really
high in case worthy of that price tag
though with all that aside let's start
building this thing and then
benchmarking it and also all the parts
that I've used in today's video will be
in the description below so be sure to
check that out if you're interested in
any of the parts that I've used here
today
so after a few hours of intense building
we've finally completed the conquer rig
here it is in all its glory we're gonna
take it outside soon while the sun's
still out get some nice b-roll shots and
also on that note with high end builds
you generally would want to get
cosmetics to match that performance this
thing is insane
we'll show you some benchmarks very soon
but also we've got the cosmetics to
match that I mean if I was going to go
out and buy a brand new car for example
I'd want that thing to look just as good
as it goes fast so we've now set up the
Cougar and we've got pub G in the
background running at 4k high settings
with the 1080i however one problem I did
come into was that the LED vengence
memory I had to actually pull two sticks
of this out of the gaming seven Horace X
399 motherboard because the
compatibility issues at the moment this
is an infant motherboard it's in its
infant stages so we'll need a BIOS
update to bring out the full four sticks
of 16 gigabytes of memory to get 64 in
total however with that said let's take
a look at the performance figures of a
few games of 4k and then we'll do some
productivity benchmarks for you guys
so they were the games done 4k
resolution this PC handled those games
absolutely fine it was a really good
experience really smooth and what we got
behind me now is an Adobe Premiere Pro
project 4k over half an hour of footage
we're gonna click the render button time
and see how long this thing takes so
this thing for 4k video editing in
Premiere Pro it's called 48 minutes to
render over 35 minutes of footage at 4k
so that is insane
really good performance if you're
looking for something for productivity
but with those benchmarks I'll run for
you guys Cinebench and pov-ray give you
guys a little tease without giving too
much up in nineteen fifty x review away
so there are these guys the thread
Ripper build it is finished and it is
performing so well in productivity
benchmarks also the gaming numbers are
really good at 4k too so this thing will
do really well in the latest titles and
of course where it shines best is doing
workstation applications like Adobe
Premiere Pro if your video editing like
me it's gonna kick some absolute tail
and we're a build like this is doing
really well because of the pots included
that see Sonic focus gold power supply
that thing is modular whisper quiet and
didn't miss a beat also a good thing
about it is the black cabling included I
don't have to go out and get cable
extensions because they look really
sleek and of course I can get rid of all
the extra clutter in the build itself
and of course for the cooling we go with
the H 100 IV 2 from Corsair this thing
did a good job it handled the CPU at 4
gigahertz only just it was getting
pretty warm on the radiator
also the vrm was getting pretty hot too
however if you want to step up cooling
on thread Ripper you can as an
additional 4 pin connector and I would
suggest getting a 360 mil rad if you've
wanted to take this CPU higher than 4
gigahertz over the graphics card the
Duke from MSI the 1080 TI this thing was
remaining whisper-quiet
and putting out really good numbers at
4k gaming on high settings on even some
of the latest titles now the last part
in this build that made a complete is
the gaming 7 from Oris is the x3 99
motherboard it is a little bit expensive
coming in around 360 us so it is a
expensive motherboard but if you're
gonna get LED lighting and you're gonna
do it right on a motherboard then this
is how it should look in my opinion this
board just lit up so well I'm not really
a big fan of lighting on cosmetics with
motherboards but this thing did such a
good job if you want it done properly
this is how you should do it and of
course the cosmetics isn't the only good
thing about this motherboard when it
also came to the performance of the
board itself in the vrm and the BIOS
control this thing did really well too
you've got the option to control load
line calibration settings and also
control the switching weight on the VRM
and how many phases of being
used of course with the performance
figures I only gave you guys a taste of
what this thing can do especially the
1950 ex I will be uploading a comparison
between the 1950s and the 7900 ex very
soon so I'll put the link up here when
that video is available in the
description below where I'll be showing
all the productivity scores that I've
tested and also including a lot more
gaming benchmarks that are both its
stock speeds with this CPU and overclock
settings versus 7900 ex with the same
deal so one thing that did annoy me
however about this build in the 1950 ex
in general is the rise in master
software which basically when you
install it you can control things like
clock speeds and also change between
creative mode and gaming mode creative
mode is out of the box settings 16 cos
32 threads great for productivity though
when you turn on gaming mode you will
get slightly better performance in games
however with that said you will have
your core count and threads down to 8
cos 16 threads essentially making it
arisin 7 1700 which in ways you have to
restart your computer to change it to
gaming mode and then restart it to go
back to creative mode so in ways it
wastes that time that I'm sure a lot of
people are going to spend the extra
money on in order to buy the 1950 ex
when they're doing things like rendering
videos so now of course I know a lot of
people gonna be asking about this case
behind me this is cougars conquer case
it's their flagship model it comes in at
$300 u.s. so it is quite expensive if
you're in Australia it's 350 AUD however
it is good to see that cougar is pricing
their parts internationally quite fairly
so that is a good thing about cougar in
the case behind me here now it's is
all-metal construction with tempered
glass very high quality and I will say
it does take a lot of time to build in
because you do have to be careful with
all the parts as to not scratch the
metal for example and of course whenever
you're working with tempered glass you
should be taking extra care as well now
with this all-metal construction it is
of course high quality but it is very
heavy too so keep that in mind if you
want to call it around
I recommend holding on to the top panel
here that is detached from the tempered
glass itself however when it came to
working with this case it was amazing
it's so spacious it's so easy to work
with the instruction manual is so
detailed you can do it all
a couple of hours took me about three
hours to do this build from start to
finish
cable management on the behind of the
case was extremely easy to work with
however besides the awesome construction
Cougars also sought out this case very
well you get three included fans which
light up orange and go with the orange
and black theme of this build they're
also very quiet and quite powerful now
at the front of the case you can mount a
240 ml rad and up the top of the case
you can mount a 360 mil rad so there is
options for custom water cooling or if
you want to put in an all-in-one at the
top of the case you get a touch power
button audio jacks and USB 3 included to
all the parts are marked out with ease
in the top of the case even detaches for
ease of installation of the water cooler
although this case may seem perfect thus
far there's actually two little things
that I didn't like about the conker the
first being the drive mounting options
they include a bracket which supports
two SSDs 2.5 inch or one 3.5 inch drive
bay now for me personally I always love
to use a combination of SSDs and hard
drives in my builds I believe it's a
perfect balance of speed and value for
money in terms of storage and with this
case what I found was I had to actually
get o mount one SSD on the back and one
harddrive on the front so typically I'd
like to see them include the option to
mount one hard drive and two SSDs on
this bracket included the second pet
peeve of course was just the sheer size
of the box that it comes in now I
understand that this tempered glass and
it has to be packaged really well and of
course it is packaged really well it's
just that it was massive and the case
itself is really big - don't let the eye
fool you this thing is bigger than a
typical ATX case especially lengthwise
height wise it's about the same as your
standard cases that you'll come into
just lengthwise it is very long and it
will take up a lot of your desk space
anyway guys that's about it for today's
monster thread Ripper build I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did then be
sure to hit that like button and let me
know in the comment section below what
you think of Cougars conquer case I've
actually also got their panzer case as
well which comes in at $100 that's
tempered glass - I've heard really good
things about that so I look forward to
bringing a build in that but I must say
for a flagship case this is def
leave flagship and is worthy if you want
something that is just simply premium it
has all the options it has awesome
included fans all steel construction
with tempered glass so it's gonna look
badass and it's also going to perform
really well in the real world and you
guys that's about it for today I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye
check out all those calls and threads
damn however with the PC like this
you're probably gonna be hooking into a
network attached storage anyway
hence why we don't have a whole lot of
storage but we've got some real good
storage focus Brian focus</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
