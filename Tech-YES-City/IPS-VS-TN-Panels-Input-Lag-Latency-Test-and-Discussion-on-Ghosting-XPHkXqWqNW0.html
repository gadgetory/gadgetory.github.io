dark easy coming back to you guys today
with a comparison between TN and IPS
panels now I'm also gonna first of all
I'm going to show you guys some tests
that I did between these two panels I
have my dear mirrorless DSLR here and I
managed to stop it down to a thousandth
one thousandth of a second so the
results are pretty interesting and then
also I'll be going on to do some
gameplay video and commentary and talk
about my Yama Kazi monitor and my TN
panel and which I prefer in which
situation so anyway let's move on now
with the results first okay so here is
the first test that we're doing and
essentially the monitor on the left is a
Korean 27 inch IPS monitor and the
monitor on the right is a Samsung 700d
23 inch monitor now this even though the
yamakasi can go up to 1440p I decided to
test both these monitors at 1080p
duplicate display from the same graphics
card that will give you a rough estimate
of which has better input lag if one
does have better input lag than the
other essentially this test is not a
hundred percent accurate however it is a
fairly accurate test and people with
like people like me who don't have
really expensive equipment
can still do these tests for you guys so
that's one thing I really like about
this test I will put the link in the
description below where you can download
this timer and test it for yourself if
you have two different monitors if you
want to but it is best compared
generally with the CRT monitor as well
because they have generally considered
to have the lowest response times
however I just wanted to compare today's
comparison between IPs and TN panels so
the IPS on the Left we can see here it's
what I mean when we first took the I
stopped my camera down to 1/1000 of a
second and we can see here the results
were very impressive the IPS panel did
better than the Samsung in terms of
input lag I mean it beat it by 2 or 3
milliseconds that was very impressive I
was shocked when I first saw this I was
like damn and it is one thing one thing
I will note about this particular IPS
model our panel is that it doesn't have
an on-screen display
so it's basically just directly getting
the pulling the image from your graphics
card so that may help with input lag but
I was surprised to find that the IPS
27-inch Korean special beat the TN panel
and that was just wow I've really opened
my eyes however I will say once I did
research this a little bit more on the
internet I found out that Samsung panels
in the heart in the competitive gaming
scene are not the best hand panels
apparently the ozu's panels have better
response times so that's something to
consider if you are a very competitive
gamer one thing you will notice about
these tests so even on this image here
and I'll talk I'll do another slide for
you guys soon but is the ghosting as you
can see on the left the IPS panel does
to exhibit some ghosting as you can see
there with the top and the bottom timers
the as you see on the right the TN panel
exhibits virtually nil I mean the
ghosting I can't notice any ghosting
from this frame the IPS panel though is
the ghosting is evident and I will be
talking about that a little bit more on
my vlog one also one more important
thing to note is that if FPS was set to
fifty nine point nine seven I think
that's the only a refresh rate that the
IPS panel can run on on my desktop so I
yeah I mean it is that the ten is it a
bit of a disadvantage because it can run
at a hundred and twenty Hertz per second
anyway let's move on now to the next
test so here's me just booting up Call
of Duty ghosts and I was just firing a
gun and I took a shot and as you can see
here there's a slight bit of ghosting on
the IPS panel I mean it's definitely not
terrible but it is noticeable and I'll
talk about I'll show you guys a test
that you can also do very soon but let's
move over now to the Samsung TN panel
and here's the Samsung TN panel it
exhibit it exhibits no noticeable
ghosting so the first test that you guys
can do is load up a game called heroes
and us and this is basically you can see
if your monitor is ghosting now the
YouTube video is only thirty frame
per second so it's a little bit choppy
you may not be may not be able to read
it from this YouTube video but if you
see your characters moving here you
should be able to read this text very
clearly both your user name and the
characters name on my TN panel I can
read this text clearly however when I
switched over to my IPS panel I couldn't
read the text that well it was pretty
blurry so this to me was showing that
the ghosting effect was taking effect
even in a game like hero's new earth
which isn't as fast-paced as an FPS game
so I do love this game as well it is a
great game for testing CPU overclocks as
well so this leaves a question of which
is better for what and when should you
choose the one over the other me owning
both I'm pretty much I like them both
they both have their good points and
they both have their bad points I'll
talk about the IPS panel first in Korean
Yama Kazi now the good thing about it is
it was relatively inexpensive it was
only 300 and something USD delivered to
my door and it was absolutely it's a
beautiful display I mean everything I
pretty much preferred the IPS panel for
everything other than gaming and you
know when you're watching movies movies
are beautiful when you're watching when
you're doing work this is the best thing
when I'm actually making videos for you
guys the IPS monitor just gives me so
much more screen real estate not to
mention the colors and it look a lot
better as well as the image looks a lot
more crisp however when we switch over
to gaming this is when I started to
notice ghosting as soon as I booted up
the monitor I noticed that even in a
game like heroes in u.s. ghosting was
pretty evident and now this is
considered one of the better Korean
panels I mean it's got no in pretty much
it's got known like little to no input
lag and it doesn't have an on-screen
display so I think the technology is
still still needs a little few
refinements but if they can get rid of
the ghosting then I definitely will be
moving to IPS for gaming but as it
stands I'm still going to be on my TN
panel for gaming mainly because of the
ghost
and that's it even though the res the
1440p resolution or screen real estate I
just like to game on my 1080p at 120
Hertz I just think the image looks so
much more crisper and the motions more
fluid and I would and I'd rather have
that than 1440p 60 Hertz so ultimately
though when it came down to working and
doing everything other than gaming I
preferred the IPS panel so it's it's
kind of alaikum to toss up it and
ultimately it comes down to what do you
spend the majority of your time doing on
a PC if you spend the majority of your
time gaming then I would probably go
with the TN panel if you spend the
majority of your time on the PC doing
work or watching movies or anything
non-gaming then I would probably
recommend the 1440p over the TN so it
just depends who you are for me after
spending a good two months using the IPS
panel I found that it starts it started
to make my eyes pretty tired so that's
something I did notice and keep in mind
though that the the 27-inch man it was
absolutely huge it was a monster I said
about 50 centimetres away from my
monitor and I mean the 27-inch was just
massive I don't see how people can have
32 inch monitors on their desks I mean
or anything like that so something to
keep in mind that the 27-inch was for me
I don't want any bigger than a 27 inch I
mean it was just huge so I can see that
monitors keep getting bigger but I think
it's starting to get to a stop point
where people just don't want them any
bigger than the space just isn't needed
so I thought that was interesting and
yeah I looked forward to getting I'm
actually very keen to see the Zeus rogue
1440p TN gaming monitor that's something
I've got my eyes open out for because
I'd really like to see what it does and
so that's something else is it too as
well.you as you guys know 10 doesn't
have the as good as viewing
Engels as the IPS monitors so if you do
a lot of time maybe if you're working in
your room and you do a lot of viewing
from different angles and you may want
to get an IPS panel but if you like me
and you're always facing the front of
your monitor then it's not really going
to make a difference between 10 and IPS
I'm always you know I'm always in front
of my monitor when I'm using it and so
viewing angles don't really affect me
the advantage of the IPS panel but
ultimately though the ghosting was if
you ask me would I prefer 120 Hertz and
no ghosting 1080p over 1440p and
ghosting the answer for me is yes I
prefer no ghosting 1080p 120 Hertz over
1440p ghosting that's just me so that
ghosting as well it doesn't go away
that's inherent to the IPS panel even if
you clock that to 120 Hertz you might
even find it might get a little bit
worse so that is inherent to the monitor
so yeah overclocking that mana I mean
it's just IPS technology it's getting
better it's getting a lot better and I
mean I think one day it will I mean
obviously it will be better than 10 but
as it stands up today 2014 March IPS
panels aren't better than 10 for
ghosting so that's something that I was
yeah so something I'm kind of left here
going damn I wish the IPS monitor had no
ghosting then it would be my perfect
gaming solution but unfortunately that's
not the case so yeah anyway guys I hope
you enjoyed this video also I'll quickly
talk about the yeah McCarthy monitor
after using it for two months give you
guys an update on it I really enjoyed it
it made a screen real estate Wow it's
like there's just more room I can do so
much more work on the 1440p monitor I
mean it's bigger and then you've got
more res you've got like almost twice
the res so you can pretty much got
double the space like when I'm editing
videos or when I'm making my thumbnails
and stuff like that it's just it's so
much easier to do it on the Korean panel
watching movies was also a lot better
however gaming wasn't as good in my
opinion so
that's the trade-offs with IPS versus TN
and I thought the Yammer Kazi model in
particular is been performing pretty
well it hasn't really skipped a beat I
haven't noticed it doing anything bad as
you guys can see like I haven't noticed
my my basically my IPS panel has been
performing really well so there is one
thing I will tell you about it though
and that is that it does sort of when
I've got all like I put an all-white
image up on my screen it kind of starts
to make this little buzzing noise and
apparently that's just some of the parts
in the back whining a bit of coil wine
or something like that it's nothing to
worry about but ultimately the the panel
is exceptional value for money I mean it
was like 320 USD and I can highly
recommend the Korean Korean panels and
as you guys saw today the input lag of
the Korean panel was phenomenal I mean
it was beating my TN panel so that's
that was very impressive I was surprised
when I saw that so definitely the
Koreans definitely know what they're
doing when it comes to making monitors
just the ghosting thing is the only
disadvantage anyway if you have any
