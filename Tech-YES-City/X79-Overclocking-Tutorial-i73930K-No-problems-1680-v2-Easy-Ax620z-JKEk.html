rig here this is x79 a lot of you guys
have been asking for an overclocking
tutorial for it so Who am I to deny a
very worthy request from you guys today
we're gonna be getting straight into it
and we're overclocking the eight cores
II on the 1680 v2
welcome by to take your city and right
here on the desktop I have three
programs that I cherish for overclocking
and I'm gonna start recommending this
one right here dota 2 because it's
free-to-play you can download it and you
can just even boot up the single-player
and it will find unstable overclock so
quickly.i to 64 we're gonna use this for
stress testing the CPU and seeing that
our overclocks are actually locking in
and they're stable as well as looking at
our memory speeds and then Cinebench we
can actually just make sure ascertain
that our overclocks are indeed working
at the correct speeds by looking at the
score that this gives out and seeing
that it's indicative of what other
people would be getting with that aside
let's restart our machine and boot into
the boss by pressing f2 or the Delete
key are the magical land of the BIOS and
this is the Zeus BIOS which is of course
gonna look different to the asrock MSI
and gigabyte versions and if you're on a
1 and and I feel sorry for you but this
is a fast boot as well so the boot
settings here I'm going to quickly point
this out before we move on because I'm
on nvme which is kind of hard with x79
because it was never really natively
supported from it you've just got to use
an add-in card on the PCIe slots and
then I'm not the fastest support it but
what we got here is fastboot so we need
to disable that and we can see here with
boot option 1 now that we've done the
natural order of installing from the SSD
it recognizes it as Windows boot manager
so you can also post delay time drop
that down to one second or zero seconds
they used like to have it at one second
I think default is three seconds that'll
just help you PC blew it up a little bit
faster so I know we've got that out of
the way we can go over to the by hitting
the left and right keys over to extreme
tuner now of course it may be called
something different in the other biases
but what we're looking up for here is
the CPU core ratio and we want to hit
enter and then we want to go a sync all
cause because Ivy Bridge essentially
this is the architecture with the X 79
you've got Ivy Bridge and Sandy Bridge
in 79 30 KS and also the 49 60 X's and
all that stuff keep in mind the Z on the
1680 b2 that I'm using here today is
pretty much the cream of the crop
you're not going to get a better chip on
x79 than these Zeon's no later they've
the best bin but there are also eight
called 16 threads which the consumer I 7
desktop lineup had no eight core
equivalent so it's a very unique CPU and
in fact it's it's such a good CB due to
the point where I don't think you'll be
able to replicate the voltages at the
levels ongoing for so I'm gonna be over
vaulting my CPU now and today just for
the sake of helping guys who don't have
the Zeon's but we want to sync all
caused here and then go to the one core
ratio which will now be linked to all
the eight cores and I'm gonna drop this
say we're gonna start off with 4.4
gigahertz because that should be
obtainable for anyone who's got a water
cooler a decent x79 motherboard in a
3930k for example now other things to
get it out of the way as well I do have
pretty much the best of the best x79
board I didn't waste any time when I
hustled the deals I made sure that I not
only had the best dizzy on but I picked
it off a really good price but also
picked up a really good as the onboard
xm9 board for really good price as well
so that board coupled with the fact that
I'm using a really good power supply
enables me to have low ripple and
achieve higher overclocks for lower
voltages as well so there's all these
other factors that are pretty much
leaning my voltage levels to probably
not be that indicative of what the
average person could obtain so anyway
4.4 gigahertz locked it in now we're
gonna worry about DRAM frequency later
always overclock your cpu first and try
to obtain the highest overclock that you
can for that CPUs level so we're gonna
go down down to digi power control CPU
line load calibration I'd like to have
this somewhere on either medium or high
but since we are again using a really
good power supply but it really good BRM
high would be the most I'd take it to if
you've got maybe you might want to get
ultra high but high is gonna work well
for me the third setting from the top a
cpu current capability now this is very
important because it's just the
capabilities of your CPU you can set
this to the maximum because it's just
going to allow more power if it's needed
to go through CPU voltage frequency we'd
have to touch that vrm over temperature
protection we can leave that on auto it
just protects your vrm from getting too
hot it's mainly for LN to overclockers
but essentially what we're doing
again we're sending settings on high V
si si si as well and we're just setting
these current capabilities so that
there's no bottlenecks when we're
overclocking essentially there's nothing
that can limit our overclocks because
some of these current capabilities can
indeed cause problems on your
motherboard and so we're setting those
up we're giving them more capabilities
to be able to allow more voltage to go
through but at the same time we're still
keeping the protections in place CPU
performance settings we don't have to
really do much here you can leave turbo
mode on I find it's not a problem as
seen with the enhanced speedstep
technology you'll actually want them on
because when you're when you're
overclocking and you're not in use you'd
want it to down clock so now extreme
over volt as well you can enable this if
you want to it's not a big thing I do
leave it on enabled because it
essentially just allows you to have more
voltage to go to the CPU but of course
there's a voltage protection you
shouldn't really need it for 4.4
gigahertz if you just want to keep
things super safe and you didn't just
leave that I'm disabled I'm sure for 4.4
it should be fine but here we've got CPU
v core voltages so I like to set this to
manual mode and then I like to go to one
point I mean on my CPU I can go four
point four at one point three or four
that's very easy I think most people
will have to go to one point three or
four point four gigahertz maybe they
might need a little bit less a little
bit more but again depends on those
circumstances the very important setting
same with this here this is the VTT CPU
voltage that's what essentially allows
the CPU the thickness of the band going
to the voltage that supplies essentially
the arm the Katia's well at the end of
the case ratio and stuff like that so
you want to leave this at that 1.15 you
may wish to go one point one eight it's
not a big deal
of course maybe leave this a little bit
higher again because my super use a nice
CPU ii vtt i have no idea what this does
i've never seen this before on x79
besides this motherboard very
interesting setting
yeah I mean the Zeus just offer these
settings that I seen I'm like scratching
my head but here's another one here the
VCCS a voltage this is the system agent
and essentially it's responsible for
managing the PCI Express controller and
also the input/output so we can set this
to the default by standard is I think
it's one that you can set it to one
point zero five just to give it a little
bit extra juice and that'll just make
sure that there's no problems there now
DRAM of course I had mine previously at
one point five four hence white as the
voltage is locked in there CLL assuming
you peel ll as well you want to raise
this above the standard of one point
eight I believe that's the default you
want to put this up to one point eight
six I just allow your CPU again to have
the band of the power going to the CPU
itself so there's nothing bottlenecking
that CPU when it requires the power
needed to get going our platform chipset
hope you will not have to change this at
all one point one's the stand you can
leave it at that you might even want to
down clock this to 1.05 since again
we've got good gear on this but it's not
really necessary so you don't even have
to borrow worry about that CPU
spread-spectrum disabled PCI
spread-spectrum disabled and so those
are essentially in if you've got
Wireless interference you don't need a
bottle of them
CPU tweakers paradise PCIe clock skew
and stuff like that never really have to
worry these are just pazoozas fancy
showing off settings mainly for LN to
overclockers and people going to break
records and they're just these really
intricate settings that does in ways set
azuz aside from other motherboard
manufacturers so now we've done that
we're essentially got the CPU locked in
we haven't bothered with the DRAM just
yet because we're gonna see if we can
boot at one point three into Windows and
after that we should be good to go so if
you want you can save this as a profile
there should be the option to save it
wherever wherever I put that my favorite
I I think it's over here yeah
so on the Zeus it's like in a different
tab Zeus overclocking profile
and you can see here I've already got a
lot of different profiles is already
overclocked it but the profile name is
we can put 4.4 tests and we said that's
setup so yes
so now 4.4 tests will come up and we can
move on with life we can save changes
and exit and get back to Windows and
start stress testing now we're back in
Cinebench out of 64 and dota 2 but we're
just gonna open up Cinebench I mean out
of 64 first and get that cracking
crack-a-lackin' and see if we've got a
stable overclock so cpuid we've bring
that up that's just to make sure that
our 4.4 is indeed locked in and it's
saying it is and then we get a system
stability and we just hit start and I'll
put the links for all this stuff in the
description below if you'll want to
download it yeah we just let that run
now usually I let it run for 10 minutes
to make sure that the CPU cooler is
working fine nothing's blowing up but
also overclock is relatively stable if
it passes 10 minutes in idle and the
heats pretty good and also hasn't
crashed then you know you're at least
close to a stable overclock if anything
so we just finished the stress test
after 10 minutes it's actually closer to
13 minutes the temperatures are
absolutely fine maximum was only 62
degrees and it's about 22 degrees and
being in here so that is a benefit of
x79 is that you have the CPU and that's
sold it from the guy to the IHS and
enables it to get low temperatures of
course we're using the corsair 280 mill
h 110 which is a pretty good all-in-one
cooler too and besides that we can take
it a bit higher though but we quickly
run Cinebench if you're happy with 4.4
you can run dota 2 as well and if it
runs a game of dota 2 for 20 minutes
it's gonna be pretty much rock-solid
stable but we'll quickly open up Center
bench make sure our scores are
absolutely fine as well we should be
getting I'd say close to 1500 4.4 but
I'll double-check
then we are 4.4 gigahertz we're getting
fifteen hundred and fifty six CB which
is actually a lot better than I expected
so we're gonna quickly restart the
computer go back into the BIOS and then
go for four point six and now we're back
in the BIOS there's only a few settings
to change around here but they are
important of course first being the core
ratio upping this from 4.4 gigahertz to
4.6 we just change that to 46 lock that
in now it's important to note that on
the Ivy Bridge 1680 v2 this is already
kicking in to diminishing returns after
4.5 you start to get diminishing returns
harden will show this later
so already above diminishing returns and
with that we're going to have to up the
CPU v core manually as well I'm gonna go
with one point three six as opposed to
four point four which I initially needed
one point two four one point two five
volt you can just start to see that the
voltage already the increase that we're
giving here is quite sizable because
voltage also doesn't scale linearly even
though it may look like it is if this is
actually using up a lot more power in
relation to one point three six and a
number form versus one point two four so
do be very careful once we go past these
levels of course on Sandy Bridge of
3930k they generally overclock higher
for the same voltages so you may be able
to get four point seven four point eight
at around one point three six to one
point four volts but after that I
wouldn't really take your CPU that much
higher unless you've got some seriously
good cooling and maybe some vrm cooling
as well also before we lock in 4.6
gigahertz one important setting that I
believe I left out is internal PLL over
voltage we will want this enabled this
essentially allow more voltage to travel
to the CPU which in this case at four
points easkey goes on the eight core it
will need
so we're back here now after ten minutes
and everything is looking absolutely
fine but one thing I notice straight
away is the fans are noticeably louder
in my Corsair fi40 case and that's
because of course there's more
temperature the temperatures are a
little bit higher as well they're
reaching 70 degrees now which is still
absolutely fine on this platform still
well within spec you would want to
ideally keep it under 80 degrees 24/7
just for peace of mind and of course
longevity which of course on x79 you
will definitely want to keep since this
is a keeper this one but also we're
going to quickly run a stress test now
so we're gonna stop this stress test and
just run a Cinebench run and just make
sure the scores are lining up as well
with our 4.6 gigahertz overclock now
because we've got 1556 before we do want
to get a higher number it can not
considerably more but we would want to
get a higher number just to make sure
that everything is running okay there we
go there blue screen so what we're gonna
do now is actually go back in and yeah
we have to pump more voltage into this
overclock so we saw that we passed Adam
the diminishing returns it's crazy this
is the Ivy Bridge variant so diminishing
returns are crazy here so we're gonna go
back in and make sure that voltage Pro
you need about 1.38
I'm guessing a little bit more and then
after that we'll start overclocking the
memory
so there's a Cinebench score unfinished
at four places gigahertz that the amount
of extra voltage we needed to pump into
this CPU to get it to this level is not
worth it in my opinion and just to prove
it I'll quickly restart the machine and
run the exact same Cinebench run at 4.4
gigahertz at one point two five volt
so now here we are with the final part
of this tutorial that is overclocking
your memory it's pretty simple here
because we've got quite channel we don't
have to worry a whole lot about the
speeds themselves because the bandwidth
is going to be huge with 4 dims together
now if you can use XMP profiles do lock
them in because they do toon all the
earth all the other intricate timings as
well that you generally wouldn't have to
waste time on and of course it helps
fast-track but what we're actually more
concerned with here is getting these
timings the CL timings down as low as
possible so when go down to our DRAM
timer control setting and we go into
here and we can see that I've already
actually pre tuned my memory it's not
that good the four sticks that I have in
here are just ordinary vengence 1600
megahertz dims and so I'm able to get
them down to eight nine nine twenty six
and one command rate so your luck and
your mileage may vary you may be able to
get this to seven-seven eight-eight 24
or 23 or 24 for example but for me I can
only do that so what you have to do is
I'd recommend finding the lowest latency
at 1600 megahertz or 1866 of course you
can go for higher speeds but it's not
really that beneficial as opposed to
lowering all these latencies to as low
as possible on this platform that's just
my recommendation we've established
already that having your CPU at 4.6
gigahertz or four point seven is not
really worth it with the Ivy Bridge
variance with the Sandy Bridge variance
though going to 4.7 4.8 is usually a
quite doable so here for me 4.4 is sort
of like my everyday overclock because I
don't need to pump a whole lot of
voltage in it and the results really I'm
getting extra a TCB there's so much more
power consumption so much more heat and
strain on my CPU it's just not worth it
for five it could be worth it I just
don't really have time at the moment to
play around with it a whole lot but I
believe it would still the diminishing
returns on this CPU I believe is it 4.4
for me so I'm happy with that overclock
and I'm also happy with this ddr3 1600
but of course what about the voltages
for this so we're going down here we've
got important voltages here are us
certain system agent voltage as well
that can help with memory overclock but
of course the DRAM voltages themselves
we've got one point five five here on
both that's just a little bump over the
XMP profiles which are 1.5 and because
we have so many memory sticks increasing
this will increase power consumption too
so do keep that in mind so for me I like
to find the sweet spot of lowering the
Layton sees but still keeping the
voltage quite low so 1.55 is where I've
found the sweet spot for my memory with
the lowest latency as possible and
that's what I do recommend to people
with overclocking memory now the the VT
T's here they're usually half of what
the DRAM voltages so you can leave them
on auto and they should automatically be
half of what this is now on certain
motherboards for instance if this here
can't lock in because you see here it
pretty much can lock in half of what
this is here but in certain motherboards
if it can't lock in half of what it is
then you may wish to set in for instance
so there's half of what we've got so we
find that for instance you may wish to
lock in 0.18 to 1.6 if you can do it
manually like for instance in setup room
1.59 it doesn't have the setting here to
go to half then you may wish to just
bump it a little bit and make sure it's
just half of that so that is a little
trick to helping with memory over clocks
especially on mediocre boards but since
this is a board with so many different
settings it's not a problem you can
leave that on auto so that's about it
really you've got make a memory tweakers
paradise which again is I find us for
ln2 overclocking in extreme overclocking
a lot of settings here that I actually
don't fully understand but without a
side we can go to save &amp;amp; exit' changes
and just go back into Windows and then
stress our memory so now we're on the
final tests here and we're going to use
Ida 64-bit instead of having all these
options checked which I usually like
leaving checks since it's really
indicative of real-world stress testing
for instance if I edit videos and
premium
Pro this here pretty much stresses the
exact same heat and wattage out of the
CPU but what we're gonna do for the
memory test alone is just take those
three options off and just leave stress
system memory and then hit that and go
for ten minutes and then we'll come back
so there's the memory test that passed
absolutely fine if you do come into
problems while you are doing these tests
then you may have to bump voltages just
a little bit or lower speeds to what
I've got here in this guide just a
little bit
keep in mind when I first started the
four point four gigahertz for example
I'm pretty sure what I said in was
pretty much obtainable by anyone out
there with decent gear now also with the
1600 megahertz you should be able to
achieve these clocks with a decent quad
channel kit of memory as well so what
I've locked in here is pretty safe it's
pretty good for 24/7 use and it's not
going to damage any of your gear and now
all this left to do is play a bit of
dota2 and make sure everything's running
a ok and that's about it for the
overclocking tutorial 4x 79 I hope you
guys enjoyed this one if you did then be
sure to hit that like button also let us
know in the comments section below if
you need any help or there is anything
you don't understand I'll be sure to get
back to you as soon as I can or of
course if you just want to leave a
comment on how much you love X 79 then
be sure to do that too but without aside
we saw some of the diminishing returns
they're actually kick in live with the
difference between that 4.4 gigahertz
and 4.6 now I will stay that again this
is on the Ivy Bridge 8 core version fact
79 the Sandy Bridge 6 core for instance
the 3930k should be able to get up and
boogie it around 4.7 gigahertz 4.6 after
that it may hit its own diminishing
returns where you'll see some people get
4.8 for example or even 4.9 this CPU
I've got here most likely will top out
at 4.7 and even then you'd need good
cooling to keep it under control
4.6 we got that today but again the
amount of voltages that needed as
opposed to 4.4 was just way too much in
my opinion it's not worth it for that
extra
200 megahertz so that that's diminishing
returns you guys got to see that live
