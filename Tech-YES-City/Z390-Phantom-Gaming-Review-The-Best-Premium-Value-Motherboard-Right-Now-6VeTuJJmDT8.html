you haven't already you might want to
take a look at that thumbs up button
which might even be scuffed nowadays but
right here on the table we certainly
don't have a scuffed motherboard this is
the z3 90 phantom gaming 6 from Azra
coming in a little over 200 USD and in
Australia a bit over 300 ozzie dollars
it does represent in my opinion that
value for option premium choice when it
comes to a z3 90 motherboard now I know
the 9900 K is not the best value for
money option when it comes to CPUs but
it is an option that is best in slot and
it certainly does use up a lot of power
so we get straight into the testing here
they've got a 12 phase vrm design 10+2
using Sinnoh power 7 3 4 1 eh MOSFETs
these are rated at 25 amps and then for
the chokes they're using 60 amp
solutions as well as using niche at con
12 K capacitors so the VRM is definitely
a good design by asrock this enabled me
to overclock the 9900 K to 5 gigahertz
stable and the temperatures of course
getting pretty high we had to use a
custom water loop the wattage is going
up to around 200 watts and I know people
say look Brian you're putting in way too
much voltage on this 99 hundred K the
sample we have here actually only really
does 5 gigahertz at one point 3 5 volt
we go any lower Cinebench for instance
will crash out I can't get anywhere near
this sub one point three volts some
other testers are reporting but needless
to say 200 watts on this vrm is actually
a good thing because this is a
motherboard review and I'm glad to
report this survived 10 minutes on I 264
using over 200 watts with the 9900 k
getting in some temperatures on the heat
sinks going just a little bit over 40
degrees then on the vrm itself with the
MOSFETs coming in just a little bit over
70 degrees with the IR camera so really
solid scores before the vrm there's also
an 8 + 4 pin CPU connector if you need
more wattage that we just use an 8 pin
for this test and it was absolutely fine
I don't see many people going above 5
gigahertz of course if you get a really
good sample may be able to go to 5.2
gigahertz or 5.1 we can certainly boot
up at 5.1 but again those temperatures
just get the better of the 99 hundred K
this was tested in 25 degree ambient
environments to
but we'll quickly roll the intro and
after that we'll find out what else the
Phantom has to offer you for the money
so we've covered the vrm but of course
when you're overclocking you do want to
go into the bias and tweak things and
have all the options they're readily
available so we had memory being
overclocked easily to thirty six hundred
megahertz locked in the XMP profiles
this board had no trouble handling that
as well as the CPU we had they're moving
through some of the other options you've
got your CPU settings which we did have
to extend manually on this board in the
BIOS the power limits to actually get a
stable 5 gigahertz overclock as well as
the profiles there which you can easily
save and then load up after you're done
tweaking and moving through some of the
other options you got the ability to
tune your fans manually as well as set
different profiles for those and update
the Basques even from an internet
connection within itself and as well as
saving profiles for overclocking and
also controlling your RGB polychrome
settings which is as rocks
implementation of their RGB headers
which also on this board get a 5 and 12
volt out for easing control of different
RGB controllers so the boss checks out
and the nvme support works from the
get-go absolutely no problems I did
however have to update the boss in order
to get my memory working so I needed an
update from one point one to one point
two so it seems like asrock are quickly
tackling any memory compatibility issues
on the z 390 which is good to see but
going through the nvme solutions
themselves you get three 2.0 slots with
the bottom having an included heatsink
we did manage to test this 4-speed slot
and the speeds were really good but also
the temperatures with the heatsink on
we're happy to report we're very good as
well 56 Idol with an MP 500 Drive and
then going up to 72 degrees from the
sensor itself with the heatsink on and
then with the heatsink off we got 87
degrees so that heatsink is making a
difference and the main purpose
so the his things definitely doing its
job and this is great for extended read
and write transfers especially on an
nvme where you will arguably need those
extended transfers for video editing for
example they'll moving through the
bigger PCIe slots you get three of these
the top one being 16 speed the one below
that eight and then the one below that
four so if you are getting to RTX 28 et
is then you won't be able to link them
up in to 16 speed or in total 32x
configuration so that is something to
keep weary
I haven't actually tested if this will
be an actual problem yet on the Z 390
boards but maybe that's food for thought
something I might test for you guys
anyway getting back on topic nvme checks
out but what about the onboard audio
here they're implemented the Sound
Blaster cinema 5 solution which at the
core actually uses the realtek LC 1220
solution and running this through the
courses the crosstalk was phenomenal
getting less than 80 decibels on both
channels however when you do load the
volume up with 91 level or over up to a
hundred there is some slight leaking in
the right channel coming across to the
left channel this hasn't been fixed yet
so if you are using headphones or
speakers using this audio out I do
recommend a volume level of 90 or below
the balance of the left and right
channels themselves were phenomenal
within 0 2.1 decibels of each other and
then running through a frequency
response curve doing a full sweep here
we saw that we were getting from seven
Hertz to zero Hertz literally less than
like two decibels drop off and then
after that we've got a pretty much
perfectly flat line going the whole way
through so these are phenomenal numbers
this will give you a balanced and great
listening experience especially for
Kansas support 20 Hertz to 20 kilohertz
you'll definitely get that sub bass
coming through which is a really good
thing and the last thing the chest on
audio is the mic import itself using a
quick noise test here we loaded it up to
maximum of plus 30 DB 100 volume and we
see here they're using noise suppression
it is obvious and this is a good thing
if you want to play games and have your
friends listen to you clearly but it
isn't great for professional audio
recordings because essentially what will
happen is it will cancel out a line of
frequency which will cut through your
voice essentially degrading the quality
of your voice so not recommended for
professional recordings they're really
good for gaming where you just want to
get a conversation across to you
friends so now moving on with the extra
features and connectors available in
this board you get at the rear five USB
ports plus a Type C so six in total
however the extra options to connect for
front out headers is numerous two USB
three is also a three point one as well
as down the bottom an extra two USB two
headers so an extra of nine total ports
extended from the six which is a lot of
connectivity as well as having five PWM
fan header outs and a power and reset
button on the board's themselves and
then there's a dual bias included - I
couldn't find the clear CMOS button
oddly enough and it is a feature that I
do like to have especially when manually
overclocking on a board like a z3 90 so
I would like to see that implemented
perhaps maybe I just can't see it but I
usually like to have this on the rear of
the board which I can't find it anywhere
however speaking of the rear of the
board you get to Nick's included than I
2-1 180 from Intel as well as a real
tech 2.5 g solution which will extend
your speeds from the typical one gigabit
per second and it is interesting to see
that this kind of is a gaming approach
from real tech apparently prioritizing
your packets if you're on a congested
network so great for uni students who
live in a dorm that share internet with
other people so definitely nice to see
this solution included on this
motherboard also there's a d-sub
DisplayPort and HDMI outs as well which
can run off the CPU use integrated
graphics and the main heatsink going
over the vrm weighs in at roughly 250
grams and then the heatsink on the M 2
weighing in about 20 grams and here we
are now a conclusion time with the
phantom gaming 6 Z 390 from asrock I've
got to say I'm pretty impressed with
this board it checks all the boxes I'd
want it to check I know there's been
some controversy about vrm debates on z3
90s but when it comes to me and doing my
testing I just do real-world testing
grabbed a 9,900 cake closer to 5
gigahertz and mediocre ambient
temperatures with no case airflow which
arguably on a z3 nighty you're probably
going to go out and purchase a good case
to keep the airflow down and the board
checked out the onboard audio is
phenomenal it's got those extra neck
options as well as a lot of connectivity
as well and the price point is pretty
good coming in just over 200 USD and
then if you're in a strategist over 300
AUD so it's definitely in my opinion a
pretty solid pick for someone who's
looking to get it all from z3 90 but
doesn't want to break the bank too much
because I know
there are some boards that will
definitely start costing a lot more as
you go up the tier and whether they're
gonna do any extra for you is debatable
and they even give you some RGB bling at
the top and the bottom as well as some
steel slots on the PCIe ports so yeah I
like this board it's good and I can
recommend it and my phone just went off
it went off again and also let us know
in the comment section below what you
think of the fan of gaming 6 do you like
the design or you think it's a bit
quirky or there's things you'd like to
see added on it this one here doesn't
have Wi-Fi included but I'm pretty sure
they do have an option to include Wi-Fi
but anyway I'm gonna get on out of here
I'll catch another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye
