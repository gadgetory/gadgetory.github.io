we've been massive fans of the first
generation Core i7 series but more so
the xeon variants which is the x 56
series these come in with 6 cores 12
threads in there on 32 nanometer and
since a lot of companies were offloading
these from the server industry for
example they were selling them very
cheap on websites like eBay and
Aliexpress even to this date you can
pick up one of these CPUs the X 56 50
for example for around 35 US dollars
shipped here door however there are
better variants and today I'm using the
X 56 75 and I do believe the rumors are
true this is indeed a better bin in my
opinion than the X 56 50 but it does run
you up $60 however today we're gonna be
comparing this CPU at 4.5 gigahertz and
we're going to put it up against the
latest and greatest from the new sector
this is the 8700 K this will set you
back 350 u.s. and it's a lot more
expensive and of course it does utilize
ddr4 memory where the prices are
insanely high at the moment so how well
does a CPU that's nearly 10 years old go
up against the CPU that's the latest and
greatest in 2018 let's take a look
welcome back to dagger sitting without
wasting any more of your time let's pull
up the first benchmark here see us go
this is probably gonna be the biggest
gap between these two CPUs at least what
I measured here 1080p very low settings
or at least the lowest settings I can
put it on with a gtx 10a DTI so we've
got pretty much the best in slot
graphics card with the best in slot cpu
for the new sector we're comparing it
against in my opinion the best in slot
use cpu in the use sector so we scored
here 1080p 593 average FPS with a point
one percent low of 142 on the 8700 k
contrast that to the x 56 75 we're
getting a hundred and forty four point
one percent lows and 406 average FPS so
it was a bit of a gap here at 1080p but
we moved up to 1440p and instead of
testing at 4k which i've done in a few
of my previous scenarios we're testing
at 1440p which is what i play games at
and I feel like the differences at 4k
just become so minimal and they're not a
whole lot of people play at 4k anyway so
we've got 458 average FPS versus a 370
with the point one percent lowest being
80 versus 83
so although the 8700 K did score a
victory in csgo it was interesting to
see that the 0.1% lows were actually
better on the 56 75 might be due to that
ddr3 memory with Tyler timings and of
course we've got triple channel memory
versus dual channel on the 8700 K
platform and now the next game we're
pulling up for you guys is one of my
personal favorites dota 2
we tested again at 1080p and also 1440p
1080p the results were a slight victory
for the 8700 K coming out with 223
average FPS 0.1% low of 173 contrast
that to 221 average on the X 56 75 with
a hundred and fifty eight point one
percent lows however it was a little bit
of variance in this benchmark and the
1440p results were virtually the same so
in other words we weren't really getting
a graphically intensive scenario on this
game at both 1080p and even 1440p high
settings so you might be sitting back in
your chair and thinking Brian you've
just put up a couple of lightweights
dota2 csgo they're pretty easy to run
how about the big heavyweight pub
gee this thing surely will slaughter the
X 56 75 well let's find out 1080p a
hundred and forty-one average FPS with a
point one percent low of a hundred and
eight on the 8700 K versus a hundred and
thirty seven with a point one percent
low of 87 on the X 56 seventy five so
our old Xeon still has a lot left in the
tank
going up to 1440p the differences were
even less 136 versus a hundred and
thirty-two point one percent lows we're
pretty similar a little bit lower due to
it being more graphically intensive at
1440p high settings versus 1080p very
low now of course there is a hundred
forty-four Hertz cap in this game and
you unfortunately I don't know how to
remove it now as opposed to the previous
days where you could remove this cap so
unfortunately with this cap in place I
guess we'll never know that true result
with pop G so now next up on the
chopping board we have Final Fantasy 15
actually took quite some time to get
from console to PC and I guess the
reasons being because it's probably so
hard to optimize this thing it's now got
a 120 FPS cap and unfortunately I had
some problems on my main 8700 K rig
where it would just go 1 FPS so I had to
reinstall the whole game and finally got
some good results here for you guys so
what we saw with this game 1080p we got
118 average FPS on the X 56 75 0.1% low
of 89 going to 1440p we went to 98 with
the point one percent low of 77 contrast
that to the 8700 K we got here a hundred
and nineteen average FPS with 0.1% low
of 98 so it did score a little bit
better at 1080p going down to 1440p it
was 99 average FPS where the point one
percent low of eighty so there wasn't
really much in an adult with Final
Fantasy and to be honest at 1440p this
game really juiced the graphics card
very hard even at high settings I
couldn't put this thing on Ultra
otherwise I would go down to like 70 FPS
from a hundred and they honestly wasn't
much of a difference between high and
Ultra settings I didn't actually notice
any difference at all but yeah anyway
last game we got up here is Far Cry
primal so very CPU intensive game
especially on the single threaded
performance now we're looking here a
hundred and forty to average FPS at
1080p with a minimum FPS of a hundred
and eight contrast that to 1440p we have
a hundred and thirteen with a minimum of
86 going across to the x 5670 we had a
hundred and fifteen and eighty-six
minimum respectively and 94 and
sixty-eight so the 8700 K did score a
30% victory and Far Cry primal and that
is probably one of the worst case
scenarios just like csgo
so really when it came down to it the X
56 75 scored extremely well this was a
CPU architecture that's supposedly
outdated but is just absolutely killing
it in today's titles and also a big
thing to note before I get on out of
here was the games were tested at both
1080p very low and low settings that's
just to extract the max difference that
you could expect in the future out of
titles that a CPU intensive safe a new
pub G comes out and it's single-threaded
dependent you can probably expect around
30 percent performance increase by going
with the latest and greatest but also
tested at 1440p and instead of testing
at 4k which I don't play games at 4k
actually play at 1440p I thought this
was very real-world and we saw virtually
no difference between these two
architectures so that really shocked me
an architecture that this old is putting
a fight a really good fight up against
the latest in grace and it's also doing
it with a much better price performance
now the last test this is going to blow
your mind I saved the best til last we
decided to test the input lag on the
same monitor in same Mouse so we're
using the Logitech G 100 and also using
the Zeus XG 35 V Q and this was on csgo
1080p fullscreen exclusive to different
rigs but two of the same input and
output variables and I was shocked the X
56 75 rig scored about 2 to 3
milliseconds of foster latency so it had
in other words lower input lag than the
8700 K system I had to go back and
double-check these figures a couple of
times but that might be due to ddr3 vs
ddr4 and maybe some other variables as
well but interesting to know if you're a
competitive gamer and you need the at
most edge
you might want to consider something
like the x50 675 aggressively
overclocked in your main rig who knows
anyway guys hope you enjoyed today's
video if you did then be sure to hit
that like button let me know in the
comment section below do you have an X
58 rig or have you tried one before or
do you have a new 8700 K rig or don't
you have either of these love reading
your comments and opinions as always and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye
so with that cap enforced it's a little
bit weird so unfortunately with that cap
in place I guess we'll just never know
the true story with this comparison of
this game now moving on to next up we
have here is that's a bird</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
