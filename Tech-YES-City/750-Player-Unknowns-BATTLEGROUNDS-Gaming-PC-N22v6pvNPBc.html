the wild and there is currently some
mining craze going where all the AMD
graphics cards are sold out so today
we're doing a PC with a 4 core CPU with
8 threads and also a GTX 10
welcome back to tech yestiny this is
brian coming to you guys today with a
744 US dollar PC or if you're in
Australia 1063 dollars and today I
thought there would be some compromises
I really did we were sort of saving
money on the case and the power supply
but when I started putting this piece it
all together and started overclocking it
I was surprised I was really shocked and
we'll talk about that a little bit later
though for now we'll take a look at the
prices of the pots we'll do the build
and then we'll do the benchmarks
to go
ah
when you can't find the slips and just
go man load on this shit
so before we move on to the benchmarks
overclocking this thing was surprisingly
good I was using the cheapest be 350
motherboard I can find I was also using
a deep cool gam ax which is a relatively
budget line up of CPU coolers and then
of course we're using a budget case
which didn't have that good of airflow
and then we're using a budget pal slice
it like it was four components here that
we're really cheap and we got a really
good overclock for gigahertz on the CPU
completely stable and the temperatures
were still pretty good now the Cougar MX
200 I was really shocked by this the
temperatures were pretty low because it
had to included fans and they actually
worked pretty well so when that said the
overclocks 4 gigahertz on the cpu and we
also got the GPU up to two point one
five gigahertz so who said budget parts
can't rock this hard memory as well I
didn't touch on it with the last rise
and build that I did but this time we
have 21 33 megahertz memory and we've
overclocked it to 2666 effective so that
is a really decent overclock on the am4
platform and really anything above these
speeds won't net you really much of a
performance gain especially for the
money with something like a GTX 1060 or
an rx 580 though I will be doing my own
comparison in a video with apples apples
to test it for you guys
Oh
Oh
thank you
so there it is guys as always the
benchmarks do the talking we had GTA 5
1080p high settings over a hundred and
twenty FPS on average width is build
completely shocked then we had csgo on
this brand-new map we were scoring over
two hundred twenty average fps and then
we move on to overwatch
I think we're capping into the one
hundred and eighty FPS on that game and
then when we moved over to players
unknown which is a new game and it's not
released it won't be released for a few
months but we were getting 60 to 70 FPS
at 1080p high now I did set this to
ultra and it ran like complete ass so I
don't recommend running this game at
Ultra at the moment I will be doing some
more tests of course it is still a beta
so wait for some more updates to roll
through but the game was honestly a lot
of funnels really surprised at how much
this game offered you're dropping like
70 plus people into a battlefield and
you've got to be the number one survivor
so there was a really cool game that's
currently around about $30 on Steam at
the moment and then we look at fallout 4
we're getting ultra settings 60 FPS just
capped there you don't really want to
break the vsync on this game or go over
60 FPS as it will actually break the
game engine itself and lastly on those
synthetic benchmarks we had Cinebench
scoring 850 5cb and the GPU score on
fire strike was over 15,000 which on a
gtx 1060 is really good
however i will be comparing this CPU to
the 7700 k with mid-range graphics cards
to see how much of a difference there
are for you guys who want to save some
money i think it's a really good option
to see how the r5 1400 i know it's not
as good as the 7700 k but i believe it's
a lot better value for money so i want
to test them head-to-head with mid-range
graphics cards and see how they perform
and now we'll move on to the case the MX
200 and also those other budget parts
now as always i don't recommend doing
what i do when i hack things up but if
you're adventurous and you want to save
some money then you can hack the case
off to fit a bigger graphics card or
alternatively i would recommend getting
a smaller graphics card and with that i
also wanted to talk about the prices of
gtx
1060 s at the moment they're like two
hundred and fifty dollars plus for a six
gigabyte edition so they're actually
more expensive at the
and of course the rs5 70s and five
eighties are all sold out so if you guys
are into saving money which are noloty
you guys are then I'd recommend probably
getting like a 1050 TI at the moment
which you're going for like 138 dollars
or something
saving you money for now and then
upgrading to a better graphics card in
the future when the prices aren't so bad
and also on that note with the r5 1400
I'll take a look at that because we had
to add the CPU cooler on there and I was
thinking well if you have the extra
money I think it costs an extra $40 or
so I'd recommend getting an r5 1600 so
you're getting a six-course well
threaded beast you're getting more level
3 cache on board and you're also getting
a better cooler in the r5 4100 so those
would be my two recommendations
personally if had to change things in
this build at the moment but when it
comes down to it all those budget parts
really impressed me the deep cool game
ax 400 that handled this CPU at 4
gigahertz stable and it wasn't even
getting warm to touch so really good
cool there's oospeed 350 that did really
well to getting a 4 gigahertz overlong
again doing it at stable temperatures I
think the CPU only managed to juice
around 60 watts directly and the whole
build on that note only managed to juice
around 250 watts from the wall so we had
that 500 watt included cougar power
supply but I'm told it's actually a very
decent power supply and on that note I
wouldn't recommend going with anything
cheaper than this cougar 500 watt power
supply it seems to be the equivalent of
say an EVGA 431 pounds play which with
his build is really good and then lastly
we had the case which we've already
talked about but it did extremely well
those two fans included and of course
the deep core gamax fan made airflow
really good on this case I was blown
away by how that the airflow was and of
course those speed holes in the side of
the case actually helped with air flow
too I believe as everything was really
not getting hot at all in this build so
in the end I think budget pots can
perform pretty well if you piece them
all together and have the right synergy
and also we'll be making another video
comparing the more expensive parts
versus the cheaper parts with the r5
1400 to see how much extra performance
you get out of for instance spending
extra money on a more expensive power
supply Morris
the pool of more expensive case and more
expensive motherboard so I look forward
to giving you guys that video too and if
you like this video as always and be
sure to hit that like button and I will
catch you in the next Tech episode
because I said video too many times and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
