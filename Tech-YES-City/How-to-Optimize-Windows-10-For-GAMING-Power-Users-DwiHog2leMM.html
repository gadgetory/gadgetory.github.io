you want to get rid of all the crap and
make this OS awesome well you've come to
the right video so let's do it
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
check es city this is brand coming back
to you guys today with a Windows 10
optimization guide so we're going to
make this windows more snappier we're
also going to make it less invasive
which we know Microsoft have done this
time around with Windows 10 they're put
in some of those privacy settings which
make you feel a little uncomfortable so
we're going to get on with that first
without further adue and i'm going to be
in the bottom right hand corner here
guiding you guys through this whole
process now the first thing you will
want to do when you get on the desktop
is left click down to search the web and
windows and type in privacy now when we
do that it says privacy settings so we
can let's left-click that and then we
want to go through here make sure all
these settings are turned off in the
first general tab here once we've done
that we can then go to the next tab and
we can make sure locations turned off
and also choose the apps that can use
your location just make sure they're all
switched off anyway next is camera we
can let apps use my camera I like to
turn this off as well and then the next
setting here microphone let apps use my
microphone make sure that's turned off
going down here you can also turn
Cortana off here as you can see I've
already turned it off but if you have it
turned on you can actually turn it off
here with a little button there I'd
recommend taking that off as well now
the next thing is account info let apps
access my name I like to turn that off
going down again you're going to see
it's generally the same thing everything
here is pretty much set to OFF
so after you've turned off all these
features you can then go down to
feedback and diagnostics now you want to
change this to never windows should ask
for my feedback never I don't want it
being invasive and then send your device
data to Microsoft I like to turn this to
basic so I mean we're gonna have to send
Microsoft some information we wise we'll
just make it as little as possible so
when we put it to basic that's what
that's doing background apps now you
want to go here and make sure all these
are turned off as I've done here and
that way they're not sending data when
you're doing things like playing games
so anyway that's the first setting let's
move on now to the next task so after
you've done that the next thing you want
to do is
go down to the bottom-left search bar
here and then type in display settings
and then after we open that up so we
left click that open that up we then go
down to notifications and actions now
show me tips about windows I like to
turn this off I like to show app
notifications I have to leave that on in
case something gets installed and you
don't know about it now all these others
here you can turn them off show
notifications when yep I really care I
just like to leave show app
notifications on moving down to apps and
features now this is quite an important
tab because this is where we're going to
be uninstalling a lot of crap here so
anything you I'll just actually go
through with you guys so store and mail
and calendar for some reason can't be
uninstalled here but there is a way to
manually uninstall it just I'm not going
to do it because everything I'm doing
today can be reversed so if you run into
problems you can reverse the whole thing
in your computer should work before you
did this guide though if you do manually
remove these with special kits it's hard
to get them back on and it could
potentially break your windows or make
it work less than perfect so what we're
going here we've found food and drink
we'll just get rid of that so that's the
first culprit today so we're just
running through and just uninstalling
anything we don't need health and
fitness yep see you later
going down to travel here I get rid of
that so as you can see here I'm just
getting rid of all the apps that I don't
need so we're just going through money
get rid of it news get rid of that to
sport see you later
alarms and clocks solitaire bye bye
phone companion see you later
reading app list app see you later and
3d builder get rid of that and of course
get started so you guys can just feel
free to uninstall the ones that I'm
uninstalling personally I do like to
leave calculator on and scan as I do
take advantage of those ones and that's
about it you can see that I've
uninstalled the programs that I don't
need now moving down here we'll just
take a quick look at some of the
features multi
I like to leave all these on though in
previous windows I did turn them off I
like to leave snapping on because it
actually works really well in Windows 10
tablet mode I don't even bother as I
don't have a tablet power and sleep you
can leave those settings are you don't
have to really change those settings
I found they're fine they're moving down
here to offline maps one thing you will
want to do is turn it off the
automatically update maps so make sure
that's turned off there now for default
apps you will want to go Photo Viewer
here and change it to Windows Photo
Viewer so the default I think is photos
but you want to change that to Windows
Photo Viewer
so the next thing we're going to look at
is some of the services in Windows 10
and which one should we disable
especially some of those ones that are
in the background that could be invasive
so what I want you guys to do is I want
you to click on this taskbar here and
type in services and then we're going to
open that it's a desktop app and what we
can do here is we can actually disable
the services that we don't need some of
those invasive services so what we're
going to do is we're going to start from
the bottom because I guess it's easier
to start from the bottom so Xbox
properties we click right click there so
we want to click on these Xbox services
if you have an Xbox and you use Xbox
Live with your PC then you might not
want to disable some of these features
but if you like me and you don't have an
ex bone around then you can just right
click here click properties and then you
can click on the startup type and you
can click disabled so I'd like to
disable some of these settings and I'm
going to go through and disable the next
Xbox so all these 3 Xbox settings you
can just disable them and you see here
disabled and then we can move up now
because there's another pro there's
another important one that you should
disable and I think it's called DM V
it's like a keylogger it's essentially
what people call the keylogger
in Windows 10 so we want to right click
on this and we want to go to properties
and we want to go to disabled
so it's that DM WAP Push SCV so I'm
disable that and we also want to disable
Diagnostics tracking service right click
that and click disabled see you later
apply now some of the other ones you may
wish to disable it okay so the next
service you want to disable is Microsoft
Windows SMS router to try click that
click disabled ok and then after this
you want to go to these hyper-v settings
and right click all these hyper V's and
just have them on disabled if you're
just a desktop power user like me so as
you can disable all them hyper-v
disabled and go through and just disable
all these hyper-v settings unless of
course you use them and again with any
of these services if you use them you
may wish to keep them on or even at best
if you're not certain about a certain
service and you're like Brian I'm don't
think you should be disabling that then
what you can do is you can just turn it
to manual so that's about it there's
another one called retail demo service
as well run a right-click that and just
disable that as well so some of these
I'm not too happy leaving on my computer
to be honest there's also some sensor
services right click these disabled not
going to use them so that sensor
monitoring service sensor service and
sensor data service these are three that
I'm going to disable as well so I will
put a description of all the services
that I am disabling in the comment
section below
also the last one is FAQs since we're in
a digital age I'm not going to need this
service regardless so that's about it
for services let's move on now to the
next part of this guide so for this part
we just go again to our trusty little
search bar down here and type in system
and then we go to system control panel
left click on that once we're in here we
can then go to advanced system settings
then click on performance settings
and what you want to do here is you just
want to copy my settings if you like it
fast and snappy more in particular slide
opened combo boxes so if you do this
you'll notice if you hit your Windows
key it'll just come up really quickly as
opposed and same with notifications so
things will just pop out I really like
it it makes it feel more snappy oh so
you press ok there you can then go down
to startup and recovery left click on
settings and then we can go here time to
display list of operating systems take
that off that's just a little tweak that
I like to do after you done with that
you can then click on the system
protection tab and what we're going to
do here is we're going to turn off
system protection now if you've updated
your Windows to Windows 10 which you
most likely have since you're watching
this guide your Windows 10 will now be
activated from your Windows 7 or 8 key
and so this means that you can use a
Windows 10 disc to legitimately install
Windows 10 on your PC from here in so
for me I like to just turn this off free
up some space so I now click on
configure and disable system protection
but also I like to click delete there
continue and then apply it there's lots
of confirmations there but that's going
to free up a little bit of space and
then after that we want to go over to
the remote tab here just click advanced
take that off click OK
take off allow remote assistant
connections to this computer and then
we're virtually done there so we've done
a little bit of twiddling around there
but one last week to free up some
precious SSD space is to go down to our
search bar here type in command right
click on that and click run as
administrator left click there and then
we go ok now what we want to do here is
we want to type in power CFG /h off and
what this will do this will turn off
hibernation and it will free up some
more space on your SSD now if you use
hibernation which is especially a good
thing for laptops you manage to keep
this on
so just for me I'm a desktop power user
that's an extra thing that I like to do
so let's move on to the final parts of
this guide so for this next part we're
just going to customize things and make
your desktop look like mine which is
awesome so what we're going to do here
is right-click on the taskbar and take
off this show task View button because
essentially it's just alt tab 4
lazy people I like the low I like to alt
tab myself and then I like to
right-click on properties and then go to
never combine and what that does is
split all your different applications or
do different tasks into individual bars
so I find this a lot easier to multitask
so that's what I like to do with the
task bar there then after we're done
with that we can then left-click on
Microsoft edge which I actually do like
it's actually a decent browser so far
especially some of the settings you can
turn off and on here so once you're
opened it up there you can click on the
right corner there go to settings and
then once you're in here you can go down
to view advanced settings and then what
we're going to do is turn off use Adobe
Flash Player and then offer to safe
passwords and save form entry so we're
going to turn that all off and then
we're going to choose Google as our
default search engine so that's another
good thing there so we're also going to
turn off show suggestions as you type
and let sites save protective media
licenses on my device so after you've
done with that you can close it down go
back to the desktop right click here and
go down to personalize so once you're on
the desktop right click there left click
on personalize and when we're in here we
can go through background and you can
choose a picture if you like we want to
get out of colors and this is what you
can do here is you can change the color
of your taskbar I like to use a dark
grey and I like to show that color on
the actual taskbar so it's easier for me
to just navigate when I'm using the
windows and then unlock screen one thing
we're going to do is turn off get fun
facts facts tips and tricks on your
lockscreen I like to turn that off also
there I like to occasionally show
suggestions that start in the start tab
here and then you can show recently but
that's about it so just occasionally
show suggestions and start we can turn
that off so now for this last bit I want
you to open whatever web browser you're
using I'm using edge here so I want you
to go up the top here and type in a
website called nain nain comm and now
what this site does it'll give you all
the applications you need in just one
little package and it's really good I
think my brother
using the internet because it's really
slow at the moment but here we go here
we click on Skype messaging since I need
Skype
I need VLC I need winamp I need Java
I need Silverlight and then over here I
need reader DC and cube BitTorrent and
that's about it that's all I need from
this so after I'm done with that I just
go get Installer and it pretty much just
starts downloading an installer now for
this last bit you want to go on the
bottom right corner here and go onedrive
right click on that click settings and
then over here we can go to
I think it's performance improved upload
speed by uploading in files and batches
you can left click that off since you
don't want to use Microsoft onedrive
anyway if you're a power user so here in
general we can go start onedrive
automatically when I sign into Windows
we want to take uncheck that make sure
that's unchecked and click OK now every
time you start up your PC onedrive
should not turn on and if it does you
can just go to the task menu and take it
and actually take it off anyway so now
the last thing you can do here is go to
your Start menu and you can just start
uninstalling things that weren't
previously uninstalled or you can just
unpin them from the Start menu so as you
can see here I'm just going through and
I'm pinning anything I don't need and
then I can go hang if there's things to
be uninstalled as well I can uninstall
them so as you see here everything that
can be taken off the Start menu is taken
off the Start menu so that's a good
thing so we got here camera and maps and
so this will just leave us with a pretty
clean Start menu now so that's about it
for today guys your windows should now
be snappier it should also have a little
bit more room freed up on your disk
drives and also you should be sending
less information to Microsoft which is
always a good thing especially if you're
a gamer and you don't like any clutter
on your OS without being said though the
OS is looking really good some of the
features built in are pretty handy so it
is a good thing to upgrade to Windows 10
if you can
and that being said guys if you enjoyed
this video then please give it a big

research all this and make it the way I
like it but that being said it's
