over drawing power on the PCIe
connection though how much of a
difference is this in the real world
let's find out door japanese-english
welcome back to tech yes it is brand
dropping another video for y'all
with the RX 480 and the over drawing
power issue on the PCIe connection with
that 75 what's there now we know that
the 75 watts is a specification that was
implemented in 2007 with pcie 2.0
standard where it allowed graphics cards
to draw up to 75 watts of power though
that's the max limit now for multiple
sources we can already see that this is
an issue with the card over drawing that
75 watt limit and sometimes even drawing
a lot more depending on whether you're
overclocking the card or not they're not
to delve too far into the politics of it
all how does this affect us and users in
the real world
well after testing this card out on a
few different motherboards I was happy
to report that on the x99 board there
was practically no issues although I did
have one problem where after booting the
windows these sometimes the display
would not put out a signal and I guess
that's just to do with a driver update
since the windows display was displaying
when it was booting into Windows but
when it came to like a z77 motherboard
and also a p45 neo that I had around
here and I consider the p45 neo to be an
old motherboard but also worst case
scenario for this grabs card when I put
the iris 480 into both these boards it
would just fail to boot entirely and we
just would not put out a signal
altogether which meant that the graphics
card was causing problems since when I
did change this set up to a number of
different graphics cards I had it round
here the computer would then boot up
perfectly fine so this would mean that I
have to do with either the firmware or
the hardware itself since a driver
update would unfortunately not fix this
problem since I can't even get into
Windows to update a driver so how can
this all be cured though well in my
recent review of the reference card of
the RX 480
I did mention to hold out for a
aftermarket board partner solution that
is ones with the custom coolers from the
likes of sapphire XFS to you by MSI why
not as these cards will not only have
custom coolers which will allow you to
overclock better
the temps down but they should also have
an extra six pin connection on there
which will allow or take the strain off
that PCIe connection and allow the
actual pin port there to pull more power
from the power supply rather than
pulling it through the motherboard oh
and not to mention you'll also get a DVI
connection on that thing to bother
youtubers have also incurred problems
with this graphics card in budget
motherboards especially boards that are
used in backdate quite a few years so I
will give my opinion in there fur guard
and that is that I think that AMD did
mess up big time especially since this
is a budget card and in a lot of cases
all pun intended it will likely be
coupled with budget motherboards anyways
let me know what you think about the RX
480 and the PCIe connection power drawer
issue is it a deal-breaker for you are
you going to wait for aftermarket
reference design or are you not buying
anything at all love to hear your
thoughts and opinions and also if you
didn't already don't forget to hit that
like actually pump that like button baby
and I'll be coming back to you guys with
another take video very soon peace out
for now bye
see this is what happens when you record
your video it's out of focus and then
you polish off a bottle of red wine and
you're like damn I want to get some
videos done today
oops you got an Irish for a tea bro you
got a reference card well yeah there's
only reference cards out there at the
moment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
