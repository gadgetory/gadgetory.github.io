lounge and I'm joined here by kev from
text showdown how you doing man so in
great Brian how I hear ya doing really
well get back into the groove the
weather is sub 30 degrees at the moment
so I can finally work again and you've
probably seen that on the channel it's
been a quite a bit of content coming out
lately so it's going to be more to come
to execute man it's just like you need
like a whereas start wearing a jacket
now yeah pleading under that 30 degrees
you know she sent got so Tom anania wear
my hoodie well according to according to
rumors I might have to go get an AMD
jacket which rumors are those well the
1600 X so we'll talk about that really
soon put our hair pull it up here this
is the biggest piece of news with heard
yet most solid piece of news is is
Cinebench r15 school everyone's been
looking out for this because it shows
that max potential of the CP year right
on all threads loaded up yet to the hill
and we've got here eleven hundred and
thirty six points ggf GG good game no
reman yeah i mean if that's true right
people are juicing over the six or
twelve thread i myself am juicing over
this as well this is the one that's
going to hit hard apparently around
about two hundred and twenty dollars for
the entry level six core and that's
going to be overclockable so we discuss
it's lovely but this piece of news is
huge i just did a video recently saying
the IPC is going to be really damn good
if that cinebench z-score is anything to
go by so yeah yeah yeah that's going to
be really good so taking in take you to
that also build Unicron see that in the
background there it is there what man
nice okay the the one thing that's
interesting from the from these
benchmarks as you depend on multi what's
up I'm to quickly turn it on okay the
multi-threaded performance is very very
good so that makes a lot of sense for
activity uses people at me people like
Brian and that that will require it what
most of the gamers are looking for
though it's a single threaded
performance and that's where things are
being slightly a bit more interesting oh
wow it does look nice uh-huh that it
runs not so sure about the single
threaded performance but yet judging by
the cinebench scores if they're to be
believed that's an extremely good
multi-threaded well I school the multi
thread is going to be good and that's
twelve threads so that's looking like
it's comparable to a 6800 k already but
that's looking like it's in the same
sort of you know ballpark and the 6800 k
is a really really good cpu like 58 20k
was an orphan cpu that was kind of like
the the person who wanted more than just
the four core but still want it to be
you know on a lot of budget that's still
one of that value for money CPU play
went with the 58 20k as opposed to the
you know four chords or the a chord the
a chords are too expensive so this is
looking like the six chords just looking
like it will be it for like almost
everyone because yeah this is looking
pretty good mean you're like pretty damn
good I mean you won't need the eight
cores but honestly if it's this damn
good I might even switch over my main
rig to the eight core 16 threats you
know for rendering and whatnot this is
looking really damn impressive been from
that you can say that the single
threaded performance again it's looking
like maybe it'll be broad well II
performance which is it that impressive
oh yeah exactly right yeah oh yeah all
rumor mill I mean a lot of people are
right but you have a wait until we see
the actual real results coming out but I
mean how like it doesn't look
photoshopped it doesn't really look that
doesn't look photoshopped I mean it
could be for now you have to be really
damn good at Photoshop iiii don't think
it would be you know no i wouldn't see
so I mean you you get but I think with
this so many leaks now this just we've
just had so many over and over and over
and over and they all seem to be telling
the same story no matter if it's a leak
of the six core the eight core and the
step story is that the multitrader
performance is absolutely superb on
rising
the single threaded as i said is what's
interesting because yeah there are quite
a few people saying it's going to have I
pc of around that's slightly better than
Broadway Lee which would be in and of
itself quite impressive but other people
are saying it's not going to be anywhere
near that good and then even we go there
are some other people say it's going to
be better than skylake so it's like
Google when it comes to the single
threaded stuff it's like who do you
believe but that the multi-threaded
stuff I think most of us can agree from
what all these leaks we keep seeing that
then you're going to be pretty
multithread it's going to be very good
which means for productivity stuff it's
going to be superb and it's going to
really nail Intel at the other people
that want to get a pc for productivity
but they don't want to spend as much
money especially for say graphic design
business or a video editing sort of
place where they can see like hey why
pay all this money for a Broadway lead
ship like a 6900 k or something at 6,800
k when we can spend much less and say
they bit me are buying for like 5 pcs on
these rise and CPUs arm and it will save
us a lot of money so i think that side
of it there's something being overlooked
because everyone just keeps looking at
it purely from the gaming point of view
whereas a lot of these comparisons are
too broad well II CPUs and broad well II
was never made to be prostrate gaming
that's what the normal core lineup is
for so that that is a means of
interesting six calls is kind of for me
it's becoming the new norm but yeah then
again I do a lot more than I guess the
average person would do but six cores
and 12 thread is what I need it's got
that same IBC as broad wellies and damn
you know it's pretty much the same as
the 6800 k but then you've got the ache
or six names rate coming out which is
going to be absolutely huge I mean the
dual channel thing as Wendell explained
before on the show is for consumers like
even people doing workstation style
things dual channel is going to be more
than enough but I did hear a rumor about
the memory controller being slightly
behind so even though the IPC gains a
good and whatnot the memory controllers
apparently
is laggy so that's one thing I'm coming
out I mean you won't be you won't be
able to see for sure until we get the
chips and through the full range of
benchmarks through them but one thing's
for sure it's looking like Jar Jar Binks
has been helping out AMD team rat you
know it's assists Lord that you never
knew about and now he's coming in and
he's been helping with things behind the
scenes is that so that's exactly what
even happening who jah jah your sister
Lord has helped out is my sister War two
but is your fifth Lord has been helping
out behind the scenes at AMD and in
making a difference I think that's the
verdict that we're all getting out of
this oh yeah but the other thing that
was interesting in that article
scrolling down a bit as they add the
3dmark fire strike who's school visit us
go yeah and then the 1700 x said now
granted that is OC so if you compare it
to the 69 50x underneath that you might
go well thats you know beating intel's
top dog however look at the clock speed
difference it's at yeah and I value
megahertz are even though even so this
is the school's the true that's really
damn impressive you know 1600 x again
that's a 6-quart three point three
gigahertz I think mine at five point one
gigahertz this is my 7700 k that scores
around sixteen hundred and fifty i think
it was so you know you're going to be
able to overclock these but it looks as
it 24 maybe 4.2 if you're lucky but
forgive us is kind of looking like where
these rising cpus will be sitting at of
course those things mature that will get
me even more clock speeds out of them
but they have to reduce something to
market but this is really good news and
apparently the rising sea views are
going to be out in the market and for
the next three years so you can see that
they're just going to say okay here's
the same product that the clock speeds
will just get better and better as time
goes by so really impressive figures i
think you know with this much with this
much leaks coming out I think it's safe
to say that this cpu is going to be
impressive I think at the very least you
know I think my yeah I definitely agree
with that i think my prediction right
now and I've thought about this a lot
until will still retain they will still
have the fastest single-threaded CPUs in
regards to kb like the 7700 k giostra
but i think by by a little bit not by a
huge amount maybe by i don't want to
give out numbers but i just think that
they'll retain that spot so i think
people will be able to argue back n tell
fans will be able to say hey there
silver top and that will be true in
terms of single threaded performance
which is technically what game is are
going to want you're going to want that
single threaded performance however and
saying that as i said before this multi
threaded performance is going to hit
intel very hard with the gamers who do
work take stuff at the same time and
that's what that's the market broadway
lee and has really hit very well was
yeah the people like myself brian and
there's plenty of other people it's not
just text youtubers this heap soil
appeal that wants something they're
still going to be good for your gaming
but maybe you don't do so much gaming as
you do productivity stuff i can speak of
myself i do marginal productivity in 7
gaming so i'll cut you in there but i'll
just that also productivity and gaming
at the same time like whatever you know
more multi tightening I think that's
where the six chord really hit home
because I noticed yes the four core you
couldn't do you couldn't have a game
open at the same time as doing all your
email talking on skype listening to
music you would get a performance tip as
opposed to six quarts well Fred's you
wouldn't get that so yeah yeah so that
that's the interesting thing is that I
think that's where they can really I
actually have no idea how Intel is going
to respond to this in terms of like with
scale a key because this is going to be
pretty daunting and the other thing is
when you're saying is probably our Rosen
is going to carry out for three years is
that it seems like we're going to be
this is a slightly this is so slightly
to the side of the topic but something
that's good to discuss anyway it seems
like we're going to be on forcing nanomi
14-nanometer for quite some time
All Things Considered it's looking like
we're going to be on 14-nanometer for a
lot longer than plenty of people thought
we would be on in terms of the consumer
base ships you know that regular people
will buy the service stuff well
obviously that that will come down the
thing about India think about Intel
karma is a bitch because yeah they
should have never have done that thermal
paste crap on their for cause I think
that's the biggest thing that pissed a
lot of people off was like man we're
paying good money for these CPUs and
you're just chucking trash on them
that's it I think that was the downfall
how they responded to that how they just
kept doing it I didn't care and
basically that was the attitude towards
their consumers who are buying their
products we don't care about you here's
thermal paste on your chips your
overclockable fork or beast learn
destruction oh yeah so that's why I've
is gaining a lot of sentiment now
because yeah they've got it obviously
they've got a good product in the
pipeline but also that they're not doing
that to consumers I think yeah I agree
and I think I mean in a day and age
where we're all linked in by a social
media wouldn't it be a better strategy
from a company standpoint to take care
of the consumer rather than screw them
over I mean just saying Intel maybe
that's something you guys want to think
about at the headquarters because when
you start screwing over the consumer and
it's visibly you know invisible people
are going to really going to get pissed
off especially when you're charging
three hundred fifty dollars for a cpu
and you're putting just trash on the on
the body someplace so a little bit
detailing it that's the most shocking
thing of all with something less they
released give words if they release kb
lake because all it is basically is
higher clock speeds and you know a few
other minor things but is they should
have put better thermal paste on so you
can say hey we've got higher clock
speeds but also we've redone soon face
to make it bitter but in which case they
just seem to have done the officer the
razor clock speeds made the film place
worse and this is something i think
something that people aren't discussing
as at all as Ames II all in the past has
run sold it down
lids and I would imagine that will
continue to be the case with raisin and
that's where you want to see it because
that's very very good you should get
quite good temperatures that way and
that's also going to hurt until I think
a lot that these rising sea views if if
we're basing it off AMD in the past will
have quite good temperatures given the
TPP's as well not being obscenely high
especially in relation to a Broadway Lee
coming in at you know like 95 watt TDP s
as opposed to Broadway is 140 wat that's
quite convenient as considerably less
yellow border le isn't known for having
temperature problems like Cuba lakers by
6900 case you know not a very hot
running except you but welcoming titty
bitches to figure really if it is but
it's good to mention you know it gives
you an idea anyways I mean obviously
something that has a 95 watt TDP to
something I had a 2 25 watt TDP is a
pretty big change just like the 95 19
compared to rice well that's I mean I'm
liking the figures i'm loving what we're
seeing out of this but we will talk
about a little bit later because you
don't want to make it the AMD show
something was interesting that came up
to me was how to sheba has lost six
billion and basically how this relates
to tech is that we could see West diddle
are quite toshiba soon because they're
acquiring everything lately the enquirer
HDFC and all these other company said
western digital are on a roll toshiba
apparently georgia and south carolina
their nuclear division under
westinghouse electronic like electrical
subsidiary family that's had a big right
down like massive right down so what
we're seeing here is a company that's
really an exposed addition to the you
know poor mr. mismanagement all the
usual drama people not doing their job
properly as huge right down apparently
and they had accounting scandal going on
as well if you years before that so
apparently to shivers into the a
disarray I think that's the word to use
complete disarray over it toshiba and we
all know that they do have their memory
out their hard drive divisional SSD
division flatten memory flash
memory division so that looks like it's
saying inside achill that it could be up
to sail soon so who do you reckon all
right my money's on western digital who
do you reckon all fail oh yeah that
would be reason most likely I would say
yeah I mean is the capital weather at
western digital died not really known as
just the others but I mean look that a
digital the likes of sandisk they are
bowed to western digital hgf yeah
they're bound to western digital western
usual zou master yeah so are you going
to go out in the streets and bow to
western digital i don't think so why are
you going to more none but i think the
people in the comments will want to see
you go out on the street yugioh cup you
girl can film you and you just found out
if they've western digital my master I
think they're kinda like the comments
will want to see that I think though my
neighbor would be like like think I need
to go into a psychiatric facility no but
the cattle love it man you go do what's
best for the viewers yeah man you see
how to do that oh we forgot that I'm
boxing at the mall as well oh yeah I'm
AE to say I have to do that while
waiting for my hair to grow back so I'm
going waited a few other things so if
you see out wit and digital is chacha
that's very true so the comment simple
as that could be here I mean you know
you've got even more reason to go
outside and bow down and praise the Lord
western digital yeah goodness gracious
all right so anyway this is a really
crazy article add to pull this up
there's an nvidia fanboy jailed for nine
and a half years for murdering an AMD
fan i mean nine and a half years a the
first thing that comes to mind that's
not enough time for murdering someone
focus on now that excuse nothing but
apparently these guys they're two
friends or two colleagues old
acquaintances they met bad
whenever they met up again having a few
drinks and they started talking about
graphics cards and now yeah I'm not like
sample i hate fanboyism from the get-go
anyway I like I like positive sentiment
like I like to hide by Sandra risin I
like that I don't like fanboy arguments
like this is better because it's this
brand I mean that's not going to help
anyone yeah here we have it here this
guy was just pointing out that AMD
graphics cards are pretty good work
station cards and I actually agree with
that statement they often not opencl
especially when you utilize it I've done
this in the past don't test in the past
adobe premiere i was testing especially
those cheap graphics card slay you pick
up for the even fifty dollars like a
7850 7873 something that was doing all
my fork a rendering workload absolutely
fine chucked in a 660 ti which was its
competitor back in the day and it
couldn't handle it pretty much it was a
she was struggling so opencl the power
of opencl is real and now he was just
probably saying that like a dude is
opencl ain't bad AMD graphics cards
pretty good in the worst season and this
guy apparently just blasting him man i
guess he might have just gone out and
blown maybe eight thousand dollars on
his brand-new cuadros or whatever so he
must have been just raging and then he
just killed him yeah it's a bit of a
shocker as well yes struck him twice in
the head and then grow the kitchen knife
stabbed him 11 times and burn the body
so this guy was obviously I mean nine a
half years in a Russian prison though is
probably pretty rough so I'm compared to
maybe the Australian and New Zealand
ones that are you know listen here but I
suppose they're 12 probably even worse
but I just want to thank imagine how you
know the detective that figured this out
we've got put on this case must have
just been face farming the whole time
thinking what on earth is you know how
could this be a reason how could this be
a motive type thing when he is trying to
figure it out oh my goodness me I guess
I mean usually the rage comes from
people who can't debate like I find that
bike because you know my brother he
raises all the time when we're in an eye
human is because you argue fact with
these people and they can't handle it oh
 you pointed out my unity Apocrypha
bang I'm just going to kill here like
the violence seems to be something that
we're seeing more and more that people
use when they don't have an argument
against whatever I just turned to it
it's just kind of set to see but this is
a very stupid thing in fanboys and the
thing is I seeing a lot of other things
ceasing it politics religion or every
other freaking thing you go to I mean
this is just now it's coming into the
tech community no yeah it's just stupid
I've always said you know you shouldn't
be at being a fan of a sudden company
that's fine if that's what you want to
be but yes at the end of the day we
should always just care about what's the
best you know like i don't i'm not a
fanboy for any company I just care about
what's good you know and so should you
guys what's your best what's the best
value for money if it turns out to be in
till it turns out to be a md or it turns
out to be in video whatever the thing is
you should just buy whatever is best to
buy for the brand x because all this one
has the features I want the performance
I want at the price that's better than
the competitor okay then you just buy
that one you don't go on your spindles
extra money on this other brand just for
brand loyal but I think now that is what
are you doing I think that way that's a
new trend nowadays just wait look I'm
going to go and buy the cpu because it's
a and B that's it and yeah I OVAC is
we'll go back to the old-skool fanboy
days I just got to go get his cpu
because in jail what they indeed yeah
whatever I think that's what's going to
turn into no I think it's yeah I think
it's very silly but read back the ring
back to blind fanboy bring it back oh no
which are we having it go away we have
him back the blind fanboy so this is the
list guy the nvidia fanboy it was a
blind nvidia fanboy i think they need a
change yeah title because hey yeah and
definitely big idiot and be the guy that
did have a very valid point the AMD
graphics cards are pretty good in the
workstation environment fair if you know
how to utilize over seal properly so
damn anyway back on day md benchmarks
and rumors and all this stuff so the
1800 x is apparently rumored to rival
the eight core from intel their
thousand-dollar cpu so this is what
we're seeing again another rumor mill
but honestly we looked at the 1600 x
benchmark before that cinebench scored
that is promising a lot so that that's
the single benchmark that a lot of
people want to see because they want to
see the max performance of these chips
is a BS or is it real and it's looking
to be real the real yes and that's
exactly right this this one so they're
saying it was at 3.6 gigahertz with its
turbo disabled and six it wins six of
the eight Tests against the 6900 k i
believe that was what year was so that
although granted the 6900 k from those
pictures looks like is that yeah 3.2
gigahertz so that's a very low clock
speed for a 60 900 km usually even most
people will run them up to Round 4
gigahertz at anyone buying them and we
usually overclock at least a little bit
if they're buying such a high-end intel
cpu but it's still quite interesting I
think what we'll see is this 1800 x the
a core risin will probably only be
picked up with those people that are
doing more productivity stuff I think
for gamers if you're just purely going
to be gaming I think you're probably
much better off going for that six core
yeah as a 1600 X I think you this pretty
much from what I've seen so far there's
going to be pretty much no reason to go
to the 1800 x now if you're someone
doing productivity as well then sure go
for it but I'm purely gaming I think
you're better sticking to those quad
cores and extra costs but yeah
interesting field threat of performance
they're saying four percent higher IPC
versus broad oily that's pretty good
well that's what I'm saying well I
really that said when I looked at CB is
the benchmark and did that video didn't
do for you guys on the the base is
rising I just did some calculations
based off that cpu-z
mark and i was looking at roughly ten
percent slower to roughly six percent
even possibly six percent sizes and sky
lake and cabbie lake so that's his base
of the benchmark again really just
theories theory crafting stuff but you
starting to see the mall benchmarks a
leak and the more you do those
calculations the more that's where the
ballpark sort of getting to it's
actually really damn competitive more
competitive than i thought it would be
much more competitive it's actually the
Intel's dropped the ball in a few
different ways that wet AMD you have the
chance to catch up there now MDR
catching up and it seems like they were
in tell us were fully unprepared for
rising coming out because there's such a
horrendous cpu launch like kb lake right
before your competitors bringing out all
their hot new cpus all that bad press
doesn't seem to you know isn't a very
good idea but yeah these the six core
rice and let the 1600 x with a be 350
motherboard which they're both community
yeah computers e270 that's coming in at
a vastly lower price point so yeah I
think that's going to really good we'll
talk about a motherboards a bit more
which one is very emotional affair but
apparently the other master clock a tool
as well so just like they had their
whatman in their graphics card and
they're bringing out a new overclocking
software again it's something to add to
the consumer a lot of people did like
the whatman I personally wasn't a big
fan of it again I'm not going to be a
big fan of software I like to get my you
know overclocks perfect in the playoffs
yeah Sam yeah so there's going to be a
few different things out there but this
is just another one of those pieces of
software that's rumored to be coming out
it's rumored to be helping you guys
overclock your AMD CPUs if you're going
to go with the horizon like a lot of
people are mean for me like I said
before it's going to be exciting
regardless right reisen is going to be
really exciting because this is going to
be something new so the new motherboards
new settings new overclocks on you CPUs
that behave differently than intel cpus
which has always got for the last how
many years
so it's this is what's bringing so much
excitement as well it's not just the
fact that it is a competitor or it could
be a very competitive product but it's
also the fact that it's something you
well yeah yeah yeah pray something fresh
that people people will be interested
and yeah I think it is so secure areas
are ja praise jah jah too yeah prices
skyrocketing is making things work bond
seen these doing work so yeah
motherboards but let's get on with these
motherboards there is just the heat this
article's actually really good so
wccftech they've been pulling out some
really good articles lately i mean i've
been in rehab and stuff they sort of i
think they've tamed themselves from
going over hype and just saying okay
here's what we've got this is the rumors
i mean there's still that number one
rumor source but like I like the
direction they're taking lately so we've
got here the titanium I've got the
Titanian motherboard here at the moment
that's what we're going to be a really
solid motherboard that'll be like the
best that'll be the dark beer nuts the
best for the best then you've got here
to cross hair formula that looks favored
seduces big bad boy so which one do you
like I mean we're going through the
motherboards here which one really
stands out to you so I'm just slowly
scrolling through all these multiple
well I mean a lot of them look quite
good I was mainly quite interested when
I read this article on the the
differences between them so basically
the main ones that you guys out there
will probably be interested in with the
8320 so far that's looking like your
micro ATX board their mini ITX I mean
the be 350 which is going to be the
mainstream board which probably the vast
majority of you guys will be getting an
ax 370 which is going to be the
enthusiast board the difference between
the be 350 + x3 70 just seems to be that
the x 37 teacher says more of everything
and little er me CAE two lanes
apparently a little bit more you at ya
three a little bit little bit more of a
little bit more of a little bit more so
yeah yeah yeahs moving air temp phase
power arm compared to the sixth phase
and a few other things so that'll be the
one for the enthusiasts who are going to
be going crazy with overclocking also
the people running sli or crossfire
sit-ups or want to hit that way there's
a push to the beach 350 but because the
people are running just a single
graphics card they're not going to be
going absolutely crazy with overclocking
you can still overclock on the be 350
but it'll be for the people that are you
know they still want to but they're not
going to go crazy with it um I still
didn't adequately single agenda 350 is
pretty damn cool because it's got that
legacy pci slot on there so my favorite
Pixar I'm like I'm loving this ms I'd be
350 tomahawk this thing looks incredible
looks at me yeah yeah yeahs heaven I
like what they're doing with that looks
really different I also asrock when I
look through here early as rocky did
have a really cool be 350 board that the
profile that's right the pro for ya so I
mean there's just so many boards on this
article it's pretty cool / there we go
look at that is / they're using the
battery in the oh that I love that it's
a rich i know that looks like a really
nice borden and that the estimator
pricing right now apparently be 350 is
going to start at what they say is 7970
US dollars although that will be for a
quite a very basic multi that'll be for
the money thank you you wouldn't want to
overclock on it like the bare bones if
you go on with a 6-core for example you
do want to pay maybe i'm looking at
around one hundred dollar board it's got
a solid you know crm on it mainly it's
good yeah yeah yeah so but that pro for
for example the one you were just
looking at not sure what price point is
going to be coming in there tuesday but
i would imagine that would be for the
American viewers out there about a
hundred ten US dollars i would imagine
do you think it's 200 can having a nice
i think 100 flat the per hundred flat
who leave their hippie Preetam encanta
la well that's what I think it's looking
like it's got the same V RMS see gaming
k for you can remember the be 350 is
going to be the cheaper
said nose is going to cost less for the
board manufacturers to license the
chipset from AMD but they also point out
less on the board to begin with anyway
so you can see that those savings are
going to come through to the consumers
so the profile has always been that just
that I don't know that decent Midway
board it's got a decent vrm it's got
decent on-board audio decent Nick that
who knows it looks like they might be
using an intel nic whatever it's going
to be a northbound board for the money
that's going to be my pick fixed core
cookie cutter overclocked cookie cutter
build I think that's what you're going
to be looking like I think with tomahawk
you're going to be paying a little bit
more cosmetic tax on that board from the
looks of things just just saying we're
going to be found a little bit more
cosmetic taxpayer so one of my English
is gone I can't comment cometic thank
you I think the other one asked criteria
I'm turning key women whose medic tix G
stuff so the skins they are the the one
I saw was interesting as this list it
was about halfway down the page is the
gigabyte x 37 e or a scamming five that
looks awesome I think that name we're
going to eat learner will going down
it's going to be a beast I reckon that
thing will be amazing so yeah I'm pretty
I think this is pretty fair as the
enthusiasts have a you know good number
of boards to pick from on the X 370 I
mean that would be personally if i was
to switch to rise and I would go to x3
simony mainly because I would require it
for when I test things in sli but also
or crossfire but also the fact that I
just like having all the features and
things like that I think that the board
would suit me bitter but in terms of a
for money the be 350 is going to be the
way to go so I think could be
diminishing returns in terms of value
for money as you go up to X 370 but
obviously the enthusiasts won't care
about that and there will just want to
have the best motherboard the best
speeches the best components and they'll
go for the X 370
actually like their be 350 md to that
looks like it's going to be a budget
card now you just grab yourself a
top-down cooler with a massive fan on it
and you get yourself vrm cooling for
nothing yeah so because you know fixed
court is going to be easier it'll be a
little bit power-hungry so you're going
to want to have a reasonably big cooler
I'm like business thing right with
coolers do you think a 212 is going to
cut it for a sixth Corps 212 evo my
getting the minion i guesstimate
slightly know if you want to be getting
those 94 7 hi overclock and not have to
worry about will this cooler be getting
sort of you know well it can it handle
the heat i'm going to say via the 212
would be great for the four call that
maybe the sixth corps that's when things
will start getting a little bit too much
for that little bad boy so you know
that's such a popular go to reference
air cooler on the budget is the 212 evo
so yeah yeah well and i hope rumors of
animax bringing back at t-50 you know I
never know why animax stopped the t40
that was my favorite air cooler of all
friggin time people who had the t40 will
attest that AAA kicked ass be it was
just amazing value for money so why did
animax ever stop the t40 they brought in
me like this this cut down cheaper
version but they charge the same money
for it i love the original t40 formula
that was just the best they're cool that
would have handled a sixth or possibly
even the a core absolutely fine because
they handled my fixed call Haswell 5820
a perfectly fine I mean what's pushing
it just a little bit but still it was a
solid cooler for the money so miss that
cool i miss the ticking yeah i said i
think the other thing that we've sort of
glossed over a little bit is we've been
comparing these two their own line up
like very soon and commit to the be 350
but for those of you out there that are
comparing this to say z 270 yeah i would
see as of what i've seen so far and we
pretty much know everything there is to
know about the multiple at this point
except a lot of times the pricing we
don't know what it is um but
i would say it doesn't extra simony
won't bring anything new / z 270 it's
just gonna bring you bring AMD up to par
it'll bring them on even footing with
the Z to seminary boards in terms of you
know they got all the newer newer things
the USB yeah but won't I feel like
whatever little Eli chips we won't have
to do this do that and you want have to
do that stuff you have to pay an
overclocking licensee kind of thing mate
there's just so much and love about
rising and what it reference oh yeah on
the CPU so I'm just saying it surely on
the motherboard side of it's not I don't
think and you must agree here you if you
look through the specs it's nothing
you're not seeing anything here that's
like oh well that's like revolutionary
you're just seeing it bring it I've been
brought up to par yeah did I say oh I'm
just seeing better value 2 i'm seeing a
session of beef oh yeah for example
which yet rivaling i'd be 270 for
example that's why they've gone with the
3-series name is to one-up intel like
okay with other music yeah well that's
just smart marketing i like it where
they're doing with it people see a be
270 like om deze got to be 350 it's a
higher number okay i'm going to go far
higher check this out i'm going to ask
people about it then p will say yes they
value for money etc etc okay we're going
to go buy them so it that higher number
automatically gets people questioning ok
this is the competitor's product and
it's got a higher number is it better i
gotta go ask you question and that's
what i like about that marketing scheme
first up the second thing i like is the
price you know you're not paying for an
overclocking it appears to be especially
with a seventy dollar room at price tag
you're not paying for an overclocking
license fee on your motherboard which
until have double where r q some of the
past accuse them in the past of this is
double dipping on that overclocking
license fee they do it on the
motherboard and they do it on the
freakin cpu and it's like enough is
enough don't charge people so extracting
more out of their hardware because they
can it's like charging someone yeah it's
basically like this
stop sort of weird communist system
going on okay your skills we're gonna
we're going to charge you money because
you have a certain set of skills huh
yeah guys you know music we're just
taking to this now which is born this
way you know what I mean yeah if i
discriminate you know it's kind of like
discrimination in ways so we're going to
fight back and the way we fight back is
by going out and buying an AMD
motherboard and cpu regardless and then
not a nice so that is a big thing for me
is because yet that's how overclocking
originally was you got your CPU and
you've got your motherboard and if you
were a noob then when I remember when I
first got into the game I was a complete
noob you like oh oh yeah I'm gonna
computer crash I'm just going back i'm
reverting everything back to the stock
settings I'm never touching this again
and that's how you were when you got
into this but then you slowly started
learning your people your friends like
dude you've got to overclock you get in
free performance and you learn the ways
of course if you couldn't be bothered
you didn't learn the ways the it was the
the hobby it was like an interest and
you learned the skills and then you pass
those skills on to fellow bad ones yeah
hello sis sis board the the thing I
think a lot of people learn when they
get into tech specialist they start
overclocking after the may be built
their first MPC themselves or something
and then they go to overclock it and
they have trouble is that a lot of
people fall into this trap maybe not so
much now but a few years ago it was very
common to hear about this for people
buying very cheap motherboards because
there are 0 it's just the motherboard
why do i need to buy an expensive one
yeah then when they go to overclocking
they realize oh this is so limiting and
that's what i think a lot of people are
learned now that if you're so on who is
you know going to be doing good
overclocking or wants to be getting good
overclocked ADF cpu you will need to get
a good mother board in order to achieve
that a lot of time so you're going back
to a time when they started to segregate
the market that's when they started
saying okay there's people over close
and we're gonna make them a better
motherboards what not i can think of
maybe x58 comes to mind or LGA 775
so that's exactly the generation oh I'm
talking about way before that I've way
before I even you achieve motherboards
way back we can't make like maybe in two
thousand naira limp biscuit era we're
going back to there and that was when
they even the cheaper boards which is
built like brick a--'s it was
incredible of course things have changed
yet companies one more profit blah blah
blah you can't really blame them in that
sense but i think it's gone too far and
they don't tell ya getting double
dipping and all that crap happening now
so yeah I'd like to see the V 350 hit
really hard you're not going to have to
pay that nvidia sli license to which is
rumored to be about ten dollars
apparently a motherboard so that's why
the big 350 is really shaping up to be
the value king of motherboards just my
opinion it's just my pic with the six
core you're going to see maybe hopefully
even a three-hundred-dollar combo it
just kicks absolute ass 300 bucks oh
yeah let's go turns all motherboards of
you and then of course you throw your
cooler on and a max please bring back 40
40 and then you'll just have the
three-way combo it'll just be amazing
that would be a hell of a deal actually
if you think about if it was a you know
300 deal for the cpu and the mother and
a motherboard would be i'm very good but
yeah it's exactly right i think that
will be the big the big seller for the
mainstream and game geez going to call
back a lot of that market share well 300
really alright so maybe throw in a
thirty-dollar t40 so you got down three
hundred thirty dollars and then you get
thrown another five dollars for a KFC
five double meal deal so you got three
hundred thirty-five dollars you get
yourself KFC lunch you're ready to build
your 50 this episode brought to you guys
bye okay now i'm going down getting five
dolla your deal today but let's go to
the gym gonna go walk after this then go
go down good five dollar milk is cassie
and when I'm not getting sponsored at
all i just love the foxhole meal deal so
as the five dollar aussie as well an
American would be like three dolls 50
incredible you can drink chips chicken
and you can see right this is really
good oh so all right next up here we've
got our Baker in the
x 1080 TI of course we've got this other
article here that says the 1080i was
reportedly launching March twentieth and
I wanted to talk about that because you
know cut down tighten xp10 a TTI coming
out around rumored to be around 750 to
nine hundred dollars but as I was saying
before stream or more discussing the
topics do you I think it's too late for
the tenant I think it's just becoming
way too late for the 1080p I I mean we
know that Nvidia have to launch a
graphics card new graphics card release
every year otherwise you know that's
just how they are now their profit
driven we know they've got that card if
they release a refresh and it doesn't do
too well then the sales aren't going to
do well so again that competition within
competition from its own company is
relevant here Intel seen it in the past
few years people just haven't been
buying new Intel chips because they
haven't been performing they haven't
been bringing anything really new to the
table for enthusiasts so this in with
all that said this in itself the 1080i I
just think it's too late even for the
1080i to really make an impact Crazy's
gonna meet ya be a little bit better
than a 1080 since nine months since the
1080 or whatever eight months since is
1080 it's been released mmm hey what do
you say I think okay March twenty twenty
third is looking pretty solid because
they're going to want to release this
graphics card soon right they've got it
in the poem one yeah but I just think
it's beginning to late i think i think i
mean you sold it a little bit short by
saying it's only going to be a little
bit better from a 1080 I mean it tiny XP
is pretty sort of pulls quite a decent
gap I mean if it's running the same GPU
then cuda cores wise you're probably
going to see if I cut down 3300
something most likely but I mean it's
still going to have a lot more of
everything than a 1080 but yeah it is
quite late and to charge a premium for
it as well will be not the best I really
yeah I see them bringing it out but it
not being a big seller especially if
considering these events are scheduled
for the same day februari 28 they're
both going to have the andy and nvidia
will be having announcements on that day
and we expect them to announce both 1080
TI you know probably give official specs
for it and Vega will be formally
announce an end to the AMD or radeon or
give an idea of specs for that as well
and I think in that regard yeah I'm not
really sure I don't think many people
will unless they going to bring that
that price point as you said earlier
will be closer if it's closer to that
seven hundred dollar 750 us marks then I
think people might you know it might
gather some interest but honestly I
would say most people would just wait
for Vega which is all away all their own
yes or same again but in their own line
up they're going to wait for what's
coming out later this year from Nvidia
lineup so then that's the biggest thing
for me because we're getting so late
into the cycle here for nvidia i just
think this card's becoming sort of
people are forgetting about i'm
forgetting about 2 i'm like--okay 1080i
when's it coming out it should have came
out last month I think that would have
been perfect for him to release it in
January oh yeah I out all their 1080s
and gems dominis for christmas it here's
the new card you can buy it up again go
so go sell your life go mortgage your
house go buy off or 1080 TI i think they
have what they should have done but I
think now they're just leaving in people
don't know I got my 1080 got my 1070
that'll that'll do me until you release
your next generation or of course AMD
released bagel which is what we'll talk
about now Vegas rooming rumored to come
out in May is I think what we got now is
may four computex yeah that's what it's
looking like because they've got the
year so much seconds room it's a risin
that's a release of rise in March second
that looked clearly so with this title
recently launched Andy residence of you
so
that's looking pretty solid yeah I would
say a much second verizon is pretty all
but confirmed and I think 10 a TTI in
March I was always thinking that Nvidia
would wait until they had come out and
then released at natt I to head back
right after but honestly at this stage I
think they just have to release it and
much they have no choice and it will
gather it'll probably sell somewhat
decently they'll be enthusiasts out
there that pretty much wanted just a
cheap time XP that will just buy it but
I don't think it will move that many
units and then I think Vega will come
out and either Vega will smash it or
it's going to be less but again that's
pricing as well comes into it you have
any on how that figure 10 and bigger
live and GPUs perform yeah that's what I
see right now so at this stage if the
1080i does come out in March at the end
of March I can't see this selling hugely
that many anyway it would just be
enthusiasts buying it that as I said
what a fine XP or an upgrade over there
1080 those spell all I just want want
that much but I mean I don't know what
the cells are like on the time XP either
I Kevin I don't know a single person I
know quite a few people in the industry
enemies of enthusiasts I don't know a
single person that owns a time XP I
don't I didn't even test if I'd only
time I don't know I don't know anyone
who bought time next before that so
tight and before that so then this is
getting that price point where it's just
you know it's a graphics card okay very
much so and you know this is too much I
can't afford this I think that's what a
lot of people are saying i can't afford
this bit of course you've got the time
next be out there i've imagined a few
people would have bought them but the
1080 still is a lot better value for
money in terms of raw performance versus
I'd and xB and the tenant oh yeah I'm
not as good as base money wise as a 1070
so mean starts it starts going up in
this scale of whatever and the 1080i it
looks like it's going to hit the markets
but how hard you can hit
market remains to be seen firstly I just
think it's too late for nvidia i think
they should have released this last
month's and forgotten about what AMD's
doing because and he's got a lot of
brand sentiment now like people just
want to wait for Vega because they're
whatever they're sick of the GeForce
experience or that sick of what aunt
vide is doing Amy's always got that real
core enthusiasts like real yeah I guess
you'd call fanboy or whatever bitch is
waiting for Vega anyway they didn't care
wouldn't be it releases that is waiting
for Vegas so they go back court market
they're a bit of course i think in VT is
waiting to see what AMD does with the
vega is it better than the 1080 could it
possibly be better than a 1080 TI
anything's possible run but they're
waiting for that because they don't want
to release the 1080i if the vega is
going to be better than that AMD and
videos got oh this complex where they've
got to be the best on the market now
regardless or hand down so i think that
maybe that complex is getting to their
cells a little bit because 10 attr
thought they should have again short so
they should have brought out in in
january so ya know agree i think i think
they'll just released this then they can
still say we've got the most powerful
gaming GPU on the market Jeff Fager
doesn't even if bigger can't manage to
beat it but considering the price point
it's going to be coming in ash which I
would I mean what would you think in
australian dollars that would be
probably it will be coming in about four
thousand one a day 1100 yeah i'd say
around about that maybe it'd definitely
be 1100 a more towards no more towards
eleven hundred dollar mark yeah yes Liam
so giving on to some other newseum
Bethesda has three new projects in the
works you want to pull up this article
year just to say hey but this is making
more awesome games or like what i was
thinking okay what do they got the
pipeline fallout 5 skyrim 6 what's the
other one that they got in the 5 line
now well they fit in the pipeline ahead
full out BR and the nintendo switch
version of skyrim which okay either rose
max mean nothing
excited again and get excited yeah yeah
they said they got a number coming on
and I think they got another post
apocalyptic seems one but the wii house
would be fantasy post-apocalyptic things
so yeah there are so zombie it'll be so
zombies then it'll be so probably like I
think you'll be zombies so whatever the
hand of course I said Elder Scrolls sex
miracles on Boyd really wants my own I
call it zombie room somebody hahaha
don't be rim job I gave the EA now
offering last article we got here and
then we're going to questions which will
go from the forms I seem to work really
well last week so EA are now offering
origin access for thirty dollars
annually now apparently it was usually
five dollars a month so we're getting it
half price or whatever now so I don't
know does anyone use this if so can they
vouched for it I just it looks okay you
get access to some of those early
triple-a titles that are on the rise
like battlefield one for example EA
members to get early access to that
there's also titled to just being
uploaded there to play for free if
you've got the membership so yeah it
kind of looks pretty cool I mean if it
does deliver then I could see myself
signing up for this but I do I just
don't know is it any good if people you
have fever users before it's just the
best of the best is like these games
that they're putting up here they have
the best of the best so yeah I can see
this concept becoming more normal in the
future as kind of a gaming version of
st. Netflix like you pay a subscription
fee and then you get to play whichever
games you want rather than just buying
specific games I the only problem with
it is from a legal perspective I don't
you know obviously EA no no that has all
these are all being named they would
have agreement a fool they would have
agreements even with game manufacturers
that want to go in origin for example
look depending on the played time you
get a cut of that thirty dollars kind of
like how YouTube bread
works could see it being very successful
and they set it up right they're going
to come into no problems I'm sure so
yeah I mean that that could be one way
of doing it the way Netflix does it is
just by paying huge amounts in licensing
fees in order to with the production
companies that make the show or whatever
or the movie or anything like that yeah
so like paramount or whoever Lionsgate
so they do it that way but this is a
concept that i actually am quite
surprised hasn't really taken off yeah I
now I'll now that he'll gain more sort
of awareness I'd imagine it'll Stargate
right away because it's not steam doing
it seems the big boys so steam did it
than sure is gained much more traction
oh yeah what but they never going to do
it James making that develop makes so
much money I gave it was hairy and gave
insist i Justi doesn't in released off
why three doesn't need to is just like
lives good man got the script ready hi
Stan get all that money yeah let's move
on to a Q&amp;amp;A now guys so we've got I just
on the if you guys want to ask questions
you don't have to be on the live stream
to do it you can just head over to taxi
DTV / forum join us l easy to join up
just make an account and then post and
every week we're going to be doing a
thread there where we just I ask you
questions so this a couple of days ago I
made a thread and got a few questions is
so someone wants to Nellie nelson wants
me to explain the f'ed up relationship
for brass performances of new versus
second-hand tech I wouldn't call it f
top you know I wouldn't call it messed
up I'd say it's just the way it goes
then new new net you doesn't care that
restaurant you've got the warranty there
you've got the guaranteed it's going to
work if it doesn't I can take it back
use you've always got the chance of
getting hosed so that being said when
you go use than it does work out man can
you get some deals mainly because a some
a lot of people to sellers use parts
don't know exactly what those products
are worth they just want to get rid of
it get cash because they bought their
new tech they upgraded they just want to
offload so the process of new versus you
use pc pots should always have better
price performance than you and if it did
then that is just messed up yeah so it's
always going to have better of course
but it's always going to carry more
risks in a nutshell so that's you know
I've been hosed quite a few times i
recently got hosed with the 99 280x as
well that was a big hosing so you get
hosed you win some you lose song so also
we got off to the next year from our in
the great what CP is will drop in price
after rising comes out new zealand
generation maybe that's actually a good
question because verizon is looking to
be legit right so this question if not
two out of the fence now out of the
ballpark i would see Intel will respond
until will respond they will have to
drop their prices if AMD chips are
indeed that good especially in terms of
value for money it'll hit the used
market as well damn that's like it's
going to hit all markets just like the
RX 480 and RX 470 brought the whole
market down in terms of price and gave
its minimal competition rison is looking
like it's going to be doing the exact
same thing yeah so i can't wait i mean i
don't really know exactly what's going
to happen i just know prices will drop
so empty a lot of them like a lot of
them will drop in price yeah the new I
know he's asking for used ones but the
intel current lineup at its current
pricing will definitely change after
eyes and you can guarantee that or I
would be I would be very surprised that
themselves did not change pricing to
look online demand is supply and demand
they have to like you know if they're
shipping CPUs if they've got their
production line set up the invested
billions and billions of dollars into
this production factory they want that
thing constantly churning our chips and
if it's not then they're gonna have to
lower the prices it's all about supply
and demand at the end of the day so ya
xpect rising is as good as it is you can
expect a lot of fifties to come down and
price a lot of them if not all your
consumer
all of consumer desktop CPUs it'll be a
kick in the pants so overclocking I find
that I do want you can add in any time
cap sorry they want to exclude you from
the discussion no no no I sorry I agreed
what you're saying yeah yeah heh move on
to the next session yeah that's the
overclocking I find that when i
overclock the cpu the ram timings need
to be lowered to keep it all stable the
RAM is also overclocked getting so
what's best getting max megahertz out of
RAM or keeping the speed lower and
making the TRS settings as low as
possible i would go with keeping this
the timings lower mm then max speeds
because you want to get your command
cycle your total commence or whatever
whatever si tu want to get that to t
race you want to get that low as
possible to but you also want to get
your command timings down to from two to
one that's the biggest one I've course
XMP for a hot and I've said this before
XMP profiles are good especially
compared to default the faults like the
worst the worst you can do is just leave
your RAM on default out of the box 22
2133 megahertz 15 15 15 36 to the worst
you can do out of the box I would
overcook your RAM a little bit and
that's why XMP is for me i recommend x +
page a lot because they give you a
massive performance boost over the out
of the factory settings yeah new memory
does have XP and it requires absolutely
no time at all like as well you just go
into the advice x and b bang it in quit
and you'll do all the rest for you keep
in mind though on some of the later
intel platforms you have to be careful
of leaving your system agent voltage on
auto i noticed that with the recent
testing of the cabbie lake man some of
those system agent voltages were going
ridiculously high and you can cook your
chip by doing that but in essence yeah
you should try to lower the timings at
see you know I think the sweet spot for
ddr4 memory is around 2,400 meters to 26
hundred megahertz with low timings so
you're a gamer
that's the does be where you'd want to
get those timings down and you won't
have to pump as much voltage through
hopefully as you would see three plus
three key Gertz memory overclocks so
yeah but he said it needs to be lowered
the timings need to be lowered to keep
the ramp stable that's interesting it's
usually the other way you usually have
to hire the time make the timing time
here yeah the adding is just a typo
there but a good question a good
question actually that's really good one
thanks waiver d so high brain and have
really looked forward to rising now we
all are men yes go tractor the tractor
tractor I'm particularly keen to find
out what the overclocking potential will
be especially for the cheaper cheaper
chips in each core category are they've
been differently where are the best
places to go to find information on
average overclockable capabilities for
the various skews i'm guessing reddit or
some other form just wondering where are
the places you would look for this
information you won't be able to find
that information out until the release
date sure no one yeah no one with that
many chips is going to be leaking that
information azusa usually especially
funny but the Zeus usually around the
time of release have really good guides
on cuz they get a heap of chips for
testing them up the boards they usually
have around 50 to 100 CPUs and they do
those average averages for you guys
that's one thing I'll be looking out for
is I'd be like guessing the azusa page
because they really do give a great
article on where the majority of the
chips go in terms of clock speeds and
you'll be able to check from there if
there is some been in going on and what
not so I'm really looking forward to
that article from a Zeus because they
usually do it in the past they've done a
really good job of doing that yeah
hopefully this method or snakes out yes
there will be no it's just going to see
the overclocking question and regards to
rising us something that everybody wants
the answer to from what I've read so far
it seems to be similar to broad well II
more closer in terms of overclocking
capability then
cable H in the sense that I think you're
going to be getting them up to 4.2 4.3
maybe 4.4 and that might be about it I
hope that's not the case but that's what
it seems like right now in terms of
finding out how good they're going to be
yes brian says the motherboard
manufacturers often times will release
information on that otherwise he'll be
I'm through your watch lots of videos
from tech youtubers like myself and
Brian and all the rest of the guys when
they start testing the risin ships and
doing overclocking and that should give
you a general idea as well because if
they're all ever see if you watch 10
tech youtubers test out the 1600 X for
example and they all seem to say well i
got about 4.2 or 4.3 out of it and they
didn't really want to go any faster then
that's pretty good you know you should
assume that if you buy one it will be
similar other than that there's plenty
of forms you can go on to like the tick
city forums yeah Oralia or at this
overclocking forms as well where people
i'm sure they're we heat so people were
talking about what they can get of them
or even though my friend Serena Russian
forms man there's Russians are they're
on their game man when it comes to the
overclocking so yes in do do not
regularly they'll tell you where the
engineering samples are at two so yeah
guys so those that's it for the
questions this week if you guys want to
ask questions and you want if you say
you'd miss the you miss the live stream
then be sure to head over to the forums
and join and we'll answer them next week
for you guys so i'll be making a new
article and of course i'll probably head
over the chat we've got a live chat
going on right now I'm just going to
head into the chat and answer and just
chat with you guys and we'll catch you
guys next week 4 episode 16 of the tech
lunch hope you guys enjoyed this week's
episode and thanks big thanks for care
for joining us this week have you got
any closing statements oh I'm just
started this is great and I'm really
looking forward to racing now we're
close and only two weeks away and
there's a lot of stuff
so many leaks coming out now it's just
crazy so obviously we are very close to
release date because that's when you get
all these huge amounts of leaks coming
out ultimately this is a thing going on
out there AMD itís or something like
apparently people's eps are just being
to erect for too long that they're
falling off now like that's apparently a
rumor going because they're just
watching the rumors in that you know
getting to iraq's like that's a problem
so i hope people fix that ah yeah on
release day so anyway guys will you ask
you guys next week for the tech lounge
thank you all for joining in and we'll
catch you guys next time so and easy
guys yep see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
