gigabytes or do I need sixteen gigabytes
of memory for gaming with my CPU that's
the question we're gonna answer today
welcome back to tech city this is Brad
coming to you guys today with a video on
that discussion with memory and gaming
and how much do you need especially for
modern-day titles like maybe fallout 4
GTA 5 battlefield 1 and whatnot but
today I'm going to give you guys the
straight and simple answer and that is
you want 8 gigabytes of memory if you're
just gaming if you're gonna be streaming
and watching porn whilst you're gaming
at the same time then you probably want
to go with 16 gigabytes of memory now I
know a lot of other youtubers out there
have done tests where they've tested
four versus eight verses 16 and then
found four to be okay and they've done
great videos and I'm not going to
discredit any of their work I mean
they've done the information they've
done the tests but I'm just going to
talk from my own experience today and
how I think it kind of differs when you
look at it in a different light and in
particular I'm going to pay attention to
the i3 550 build that I did a few months
ago where I only had four gigabytes of
memory in that build and you know when I
was playing GTA 5 the game was
stuttering it was stuttering pretty bad
and now when I'm added in another four
gigabytes of memory for a total eight
the starring was completely gone I was
blown away by how much of a difference
foggy bytes of memory made in a title
like GTA 5 and now you may say oh well I
didn't have that problem Brian I mean
this YouTube you didn't have that
problem either when he tested it on his
skylake CPU with foggy bytes memory now
the difference is between a skylake CPU
and an alum CB which was the i3 that I
tested is that the memory control is
much better on the skylake CPU so now if
you're doing tests especially like
forgive ads versus a gigabytes on a new
school CPU like a skylake CPU or even
Haswell CPU versus an old-school CPU
which is arguably where people are only
going to be able to afford four
gigabytes of memory you owe it to your
viewers to kind of test out this memory
on old-school CPUs because that's where
it's going to make more of a difference
because the newer CPUs can utilize that
memory better and so you're not going to
get as much storing you're going to get
better results with a skylake CPU on
talking about
memory as opposed to an i3 nalem 550 I'm
talking about to memory if you catch my
drift now another thing is when a lot of
these other youtubers tests these are
foggy bytes versus a gigabytes for
example I'm going to focus on this area
pacifically is that when they run out of
memory they then access data from an SSD
and now a lot of guys on a budget I'm
going to have four yards of memory and
an SSD I've never heard of that you're
going to have a gear bytes of memory
NASA steel you have 40 bytes of memory
and a hard drive and now accessing data
from a hard drive is a lot slower
especially in a video game than
accessing data from an SSD and also if
we look at an AMD CPU for example on FX
8320 versus a has well 46 70k which i've
tested in the past when I had both a
gigabytes of memory on both systems I
found that the Haswell CPU could stream
a lot better and this was because it
could utilize that eight gigabytes of
memory a lot better than the AMD FX 8350
20 it's got a cause it can stream a lot
better not really like I found that the
4670 case smoked it in two of the games
that I tested I was blown away the AMD
CPU was completely choking on a
gigabytes of memory as opposed to the
4670 Gaye which was just you know smooth
sailing so that was something that
shocked me and that was something that I
realized that not all Super User created
not only on the IPC area but also on the
way that they utilize cache and also
furthermore ddr memory so now if we
contrast this to the old-school cpus
like the i3 550 or the x50 460 for
example then we can see that these CPUs
have weak and memory controllers then
say for instance the skylake cpu and if
since we're on a budget and we're going
to go for a cheap CPU cheap motherboard
we're going to be asking ourselves do I
need a gigabytes of memory can I just
save that 20 $30 on the 40 bytes of
memory and just stick with for you bytes
for gaming and the answer is and this is
where it comes in the most important
part of the video is I would recommend
going for a gigabytes on these platforms
because you're not going to get the
stuttering and as I've tested in the
past that forgive ads versus a gigabytes
makes a huge difference for games
every time I've tested on ddr2 even
overclocked and for instance an
entry-level
I three five fifty with a gigabytes of
memory it's made a huge difference
versus four gigabytes to point where the
foggy bytes has always had stuttering
even on a game like Metro last light
I've noticed stuttering so if you want
to get one of those old-school CPUs and
then overclock it and play the latest
titles which those CPUs are more than
capable of playing some of the latest
titles then you want to go with a
gigabytes of memory so you don't get
stuttering though if you are playing
games like csgo for example dota 2 or
League of Legends then four gigabytes
will be absolutely fine they'll get
modern titles you're going to want to go
with a gigabytes of memory there's some
final things before I get out of here I
wanted to touch on why this whole four
versus eight versus sixteen gigabyte
debate came into play it was mainly due
to memory prices a couple of years ago
memory prices were literally double what
they were today and before they doubled
up they were really good or even lower
than what they were today so memory is
come down to a price where it's pretty
cheap and if you can I would recommend
going overkill on memory because you
know future titles are only going to use
more memory the larger the levels get
the more physics are introduced and
whatnot but I mean move quickly looking
on Amazon for literally like two minutes
I found like a sixty dollar z97
motherboard $60 16gb a key to memory and
also at 12:30 v3 has well now that's a
bare-bones kit that will absolutely kick
off she coupled out with the GTX 1060 or
even a 1070 you're going to have an
amazing experience at either 1080p or
1440p gaming so really cool for the
money you can pick up some great deals
out there so really if you can get the
extra memory always go for it it's
always a better thing to do that but you
will want at least a gigabytes if you're
just gaming and also what about memory
for video editing how much do you need
in this scenario and ultimately this one
is depends on your workflow what bit
rates are you editing at how much
footage you're capturing what program
are you using Premiere Pro using Vegas
13 how many programs are you using it
once I mean me personally I've got you
know sometimes I've got Premiere Pro
Open I've got Adobe Audition open and
I've got After Effects open all at the
same time and I'm editing footage and
for me personally I need 64 gigabytes of
memory that's just what I need you know
if people like O'Brien you you know
only need 32 you idiot why usually why
you saying you need 64 well it's like to
that person who says that it's like will
do just come over to my house and see
that you know the memory error messages
that I'm getting Premiere Pro when I've
only got 32 when I drop 64 in their
error messages go away so for me
personally I need 64 gigabytes of memory
for you guys I don't know it depends on
your workflow as I said before you can
get away with 16 gigabytes of memory if
you're adding it like 50 megabits per
second 1080p you know if you're just
editing 4k footage at 100 megabits per
second you're not editing big clips you
can get away with 32 gigabytes of memory
tell if you like me you probably want to
get 64 gigabytes or even if you want to
Linus's crew then you might want to get
like 128 gigabytes of memory it just
depends on how much you're editing and
what your workflow is and what your bit
rates are so what you guys hope you
enjoyed this video if you did then be
sure to hit that like button if you have
any questions or comments about memory
and gaming or even video editing then be
sure to drop a color in the conversation
below and I'll get back to you as soon
as I can and I'll catch in the next tech
video very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
