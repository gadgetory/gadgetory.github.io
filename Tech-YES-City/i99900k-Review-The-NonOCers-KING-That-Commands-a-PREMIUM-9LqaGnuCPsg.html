we're going to be comparing it against
the i7 8700 k and also the risin 7 2700
X with both stock and overclocked
numbers to figure out what would be the
best purchasing decision for you now
we're gonna be doing gaming productivity
and streaming benchmarks as well as
testing the temperatures and thermals of
this new 8 quart 16 threaded CPU from
Intel to see just how it stacks up
against the competition at being their
own CPU as well welcome back to Jack yet
city this is brand coming to you guys
today with the test bed figures first of
all we have an RT X xx atti from azusa's
the Strix rog edition one beast of a
card then we're coupling that with 16
gigabytes in dual channel mode of ddr4
memory with seal 14 timings with 3200
mega Hertz across all three different
CPUs we're using these same asrock
variants across the different
motherboard lines we're using the Taichi
ultimate for the Z 390 the i7 87 Hajek 8
is tested on the gaming professional as
rock Z through 70 motherboard and then
the Rison 7 2700 k is tested on the
asrock x4 70 Taichi and lastly for
cooling we tested with the same cooling
solution that is the H 100 I Pro from
Corsair and with that aside let's bring
up the gaming benchmarks first we've got
here dota 2 1080p lowest settings here
we're going to be stressing the CPU but
also gonna be throwing up some 1440p
ultra numbers as well to see that
difference minimalized as you go up in
resolutions and at this resolution we
saw that the 9900 K and also the 8700 K
were neck-and-neck once they were
overclocked and here's the biggest
difference with the 9900 K compared to
the two other CPUs and that is out of
the box it's pretty much going near max
this thing is aggressively clocked even
in the bias I'm turning off multi-core
enhancement and it just seems to have
some very aggressive turbo settings that
pretty much take it to 4.7 gigahertz out
of the box for 8 cores 16 threads that's
very aggressive so basically the catch
of this whole review is this CPU is
going to be great if you don't know how
to overclock and you want to go out buy
a good mother board good cooling
solution and just call it a day
however that said we can see the 8700 K
is kicking it hard in a lot of these
benchmarks at 5 gigahertz same with the
risin 2700 X with its 4.2 gigahertz and
its value proposition at 1440p the
numbers really start closing the gaps
here between these three CPUs and this
is with the RT X 28 ETA pretty much the
best graphics card you can get for
gaming at the moment moving across to
Rainbow six siege we saw here at 1080p
the lowest settings the 9900 K in the
8700 K we're coming out a little bit
ahead of the Rison 720 700 X however it
is important to note that the monitors
used for gaming at the moment the max
that I know of is 240 Hertz so all three
of these CPUs are still giving average
FPS above these numbers so unless you
are an absolute big-ticket item player
out there and you're going for massive
prizes then the differences really
aren't going to be that much in actual
real world input delay with these three
CPUs however the ring bus does have its
advantages if you want to check out a
video on that I'll put it up here
however moving over to the 1440p numbers
for Rainbow six siege see that the gap
does close and it's all above 144 Hertz
which is popular for 1440p monitors
especially for competitive gamers and
then we move out of the SAS ins Creed
origins we saw both the Intel's scoring
a little bit ahead of the Rison 720 700
X and then moving on to 1440p what we
had here was a gap closing yet again and
of course if we take it to 4k the gaps
gonna close even more and now onto grand
theft auto 5 1080p lower settings that I
could dial in here to stress that CPU
out we saw that the Intel's
both the 8700 a and the 9900 K were
actually breaking this engine to the
point where the 1% in point 1% lows were
giving out some stuttering in certain
cases of the benchmarks and since we do
average these benchmarks we do get a
lower point 1 and 1% low then that of
the 2700 X which was running smoother
because it wasn't breaking the engine
1440p saw max settings all three of
these CPUs scoring very similar numbers
and it was a smooth experience brian
flatt mid review this is why I got the T
here because the T just calms me down
let's all the data come back into my I'd
say it's about a 10 terabyte hard drive
up here
and this is sort of reworking in the
moment digit and on to Counter Strike
global Offensive here we had 1080p
lowest settings on this community-made
benchmark showed that the 9900 K was
coming out ahead of the 8700 K but it
didn't come out a whole lot like I was
surprised to see that it wasn't coming
out a massive amount especially at 5
gigahertz these stock 4.40 Hertz however
was behind considerably and then the
rosen 2700 X was falling behind - in
this benchmark but we do have to note
that the FPS numbers are still very high
all three of these CPUs will be great
for gaming on this competitively moving
up to 1440 P max settings so these gaps
close yet again like all the other games
however there was still a pronounced
difference with the 9900 K and then
moving over to call of duty black ops 4
blackout this is the Battle Royale I'm
actually really enjoying this game and
they've actually boosted all the FPS
caps in multiplayer now so there's
unlimited FPS which was great just in
time for this review and we saw the
numbers here showing that the 9900 K was
coming out of top the 8700 K was very
close it was a neck-and-neck battle and
the Rison 2700 X was still getting very
good FPS but when we move over to the
streaming benchmarks this is the game
that I decided to test the streaming on
with the stream labs I absolutely love
this I fell in love with this streaming
application and we saw here that the out
of the box settings were 6 megabits per
second off the CPU encoding so that the
9900 K was then able to spread its wings
over the 8700 K that's probably the only
time in these gaming benchmarks
especially when we're looking at
overclocked versus overclocked where
that CPU came out ahead the 2700 X did
very well when it came to streaming and
then move over to 1440p with this game
with the max settings so that there was
still a little bit of a difference but
the gap again was closing so there's a
gaming benchmarks done and dusted and
what we saw here was the 9900 K it's
very aggressively clocked out of the box
so if you're not into overclocking and
you want the best FPS possible then this
CPU is definitely going to give that
however the 8700 K at 5 gigahertz in my
opinion is still the money shot even for
competitive gamers who need the best
PS and when it comes to streaming I
always recommend people utilize their
GPU if possible because the money you
spend on a GPU with its GPU compute
power versus CPUs is a lot more so if
you can utilize that then you're
definitely going to be saving money
especially when it comes to utilizing
the 8700 K and it's five gigahertz
overclock 2700 X it does very well in
gaming if you're a competitive gamer
you're still gonna get a fantastic
experience out of this CPU this is
really getting into that territory of
paying the premium for these CPUs and
getting that little bit extra we'll talk
about the pricing later but let's move
over now to some productivity benchmarks
and first up we had Adobe Premiere Pro
this is now utilizing Intel CPUs very
well in the 99 hundred K was coming out
on top here the 8700 K in the 2,700 X
we're kind of coming in the same
ballpark here and this is a 4k 30-minute
video file rendered at 25 megabits per
second which is what I usually do in my
workflow so the 99 hundred K would be
the best however people have said you
can use the HD encoder which will save
you even more time I'm yet to experiment
with it because honestly my workflow is
absolutely fine and I'm using a 1680 v2
in my main workstation but onto 7-zip
this is a decompression and compression
benchmark here we saw the 9900 K Ashley
trading blows with the risin 2700 X when
it came to decompressing when it came to
compressing it was coming out on top
the 8700 K was kind of coming close to
the rising 2700 X here but then
decompressing horizon 2700 X definitely
took the cake
moving over to v-ray a CPU simulated
benchmark utilizing all caused all
threads and the 9900 K was coming out on
top and then the followed by the 2700 X
and then the 8700 K we would razón a
studio 1a music benchmark for you music
audio files out there people who love
making music making the yes-men mix down
we saw the 9900 K did the best here and
then followed by the rising 2700 X and
then also the 8700 K and then move over
to Cinebench the simulated benchmark
that always comes into every single
review that pretty much everyone does
nowadays we saw the 9900 K coming out on
top and you can see how aggressive this
CPU is
walked out of the box using my custom
overclock settings I could barely get
any more out of the H 100 I Pro then we
saw the rise in 2700 X coming in with a
great value proposition then the 8700 K
coming in with the best single threaded
score so I guess this sort of sums it up
in general what these three CPUs are all
about and that is the 8700 K at 5
gigahertz still gets up in boogies and
what we're going to do is we're going to
relate the power consumption figures
right after this because it is pretty
important the I 999 hundred K was
juicing a considerable amount more power
than both the two counterparts here
we're to the point where I was kind of
surprised
maybe the BIOS needs a bit of an update
some tuning needs to happen and I guess
a more micro level because the
temperatures were also pretty damn high
all surprised
out of the box this thing was just going
over a hundred degrees and then we
looked at the overclock numbers that
were going near a hundred and fifteen
degrees and even after 15 minutes of I
264 it was actually thermal throttling
so I was lucky I was able to get the
benchmarks done but with that said
they've raised the t.j.maxx on this CPU
now to a hundred and fifteen degrees
that's the new safety limit previously
it was a hundred and five degrees on the
8700 K I believe and then on the rise in
2,700 X I believe it's 95 degrees and so
what we're seeing here is something that
demands a big cooler if you're gonna go
with the 99 hundred K make sure you get
something very big for this I'd say a
360 mil all in one or a custom to 80 mil
cooler would be a prerequisite as we're
using a 240 ml here today and although
it's not getting overloaded it's not
getting hot
it's just that base plate is not big
enough to absorb that initial heat and
yes they are using a solder between the
die and the IHS this time around but the
problem is I still managed to deal with
the CPU and that's going to be a
separate video on its own so stay tuned
for those results but now moving over to
fire strike we saw here with the CPU
physics scores the 8700 K was sort of
trading blows with the Verizon 2,700 X
9900 K again coming out on top with its
both out-of-the-box aggressive settings
and its stock settings but in my opinion
the 8700 K with
6 cores 12 threads was doing very well
in this benchmark and it just shows you
when it comes to gaming I still think
the six cores 12 threads higher clock
speeds is the most relevant choice but
that about wraps it up for the
benchmarks in the last of the new graph
so I'm gonna show you guys here is the
pricing in Australia this thing is going
for well over eight hundred and fifty
dollars currently and then in the u.s.
it's going for about five hundred and
thirty US and we see compared to the
rise in 2700 X and even the 8700 K it is
a league above these two CPUs in terms
of pricing and keep in mind it will use
more heat so in general it will need a
bigger cooler also need a bigger power
play and then you've got the premium of
the Z 390 motherboards now that do have
their better Hardware on board compared
to XIII seventies and also X 470
motherboards so we're left in a state
where this is a premium product but it's
definitely adding a premium not just on
the CPU costs but all the other
Augmented costs involved so that's
something you've got to look at with
this CPU how much do you want it and are
you prepared to pay the premium when it
comes to gaming and that's all you do
and you want that flagship CPU then the
8700 K o'clock to 5 gigahertz is still
going to be my recommendation coming out
of this the 9900 K is only going to get
a recommendation for gaming if you have
a lot of money and you don't like
overclocking and you don't have the time
all you want to do is go out and buy a
massive cooler good motherboard and the
9900 K and have happy days also when it
comes to productivity it is a ring boss
CPU and it is doing better than the
8,700 case so if you do need to save
time and you are a professional Video
Editor or you do other productivity work
that involves needing those extra two
cores four threads of ring boss then the
9900 K will deliver but again depends on
how much time saved first that extra
costs are you willing to pay
of course the Rison 2700 X here being
the value star it is a king of value
through and through I like this CPU a
lot because one thing we haven't talked
about yet is that both these CPUs here
the Intel counterparts don't come with
coolers included they're Rison 2700 X at
its lowest price point out of these
three CPUs does come with the included
RGB prism cooler which does
not only look really good but it also
cools really well getting the CPU out of
the box up to four gigahertz on all
cores threads no problems with the
included cooler also I'm not introducing
the mesh architecture chips into the
equation nor am i introducing thread
Ripper into these comparisons here today
because I do believe they introduce more
latency at a base level but this is
something a lot of reviewers aren't
testing at the moment I'm only touching
base on this so what we've got here is
the best latency chips from both Intel
and AMD on the bench so in a nutshell
value King gaming king king of
everything with a considerable premium
attached and that's about it for today
if you guys enjoyed this review then be
sure to hit that like button and let us
know in the comment section below what
you think of the new I $9.99 hundred K
I'm also going to be doing two separate
videos with the 99 hundred K versus the
2700 X civically because I feel like
there's a lot more talking points than
just today's video then also be
comparing it just against the 8700 K
with talking points of their own and
then of course stay tuned for the big
one where we're gonna be testing ninety
nine hundred K versus 2700 X versus the
older Xeon we're gonna be doing a lot
more in depth tests for you guys and
that's a wrap catching another tech
video very soon he's out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
