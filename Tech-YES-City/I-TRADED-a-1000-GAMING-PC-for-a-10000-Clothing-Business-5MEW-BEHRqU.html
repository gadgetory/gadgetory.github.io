never been offered something like this
before and it just seems so bizarre that
I want to check it out and if it's legit
then dad man over here is gonna have the
final say on whether we do this trade
now what happened was I'm selling a PC
on the Facebook marketplace and if you
guys wondering I did get unbanned from
the Facebook marketplace so I'm able to
sell pcs again but someone offered to
trade me $14,000 supposedly of clothes
for my gaming pcs so we're gonna go and
borrow dad man suit and head up and
check it out and if everything does
check out and they say that their
clothes and their store is worth the
money and they want to trade it for this
gaming PC then I think we may be able to
strike a deal but before we do that
we're gonna ask dad man what he thinks
of this potential deal because we're
gonna take you guys through a journey
and I know you guys have missed him so
what do you recognize a girl if it's
genuine let's go for it and also how you
been holding up I've been hearing well
and the viewers of missed you
hello yes take citizens
so here's the PC that I'm potentially
trading here it's an i7 4770k X 2070 and
a pretty good power supply SSD hard
drive and I'm asking about 1400 Aussie
dollars for it and the person of course
says that their clothes are worth
$14,000 dollars which in USD terms would
be about 10000 USD or currently a little
bit less than one Bitcoin but without
said let's go hit the road and I've also
on the way got to trade a GTX 10 80 TI
for some cash and a GTX 970 so don't
worry guys I'm always on top of them
deals
don't just run tracking at 1080 p i4 g +
7 r enforced and old so it's time I
would but without said damn cannon out
head oh it's closed store and check out
what it's all about and it really
trading this PC and right
still right here dead man accepted he
said yet we're gonna take it so this is
either going to be the mother stupidest
or one of the smartest things I've ever
done I don't know yet
so some bloke collapsed in there yeah do
you know why
before climbing business or the computer
so it's now the next day in the morning
and we've just unpacked all this stuff
here I just cannot believe the sheer
amount of clothes that we've got here I
was like damn I got definitely got more
than I bargained for when I first saw
the seven tubs I thought okay maybe
we're not getting a whole lot but they
were really tightly packed in all those
tubs you just see here we just got merge
four days here on the chair floor I just
Wow I've even got hats there and this
stuff is really high-quality stuff I
mean you've got Chino jeans down here
we've got other joggers and caps that
kind of don't make a whole lot of sense
to me but they even threw in the
business cards so I'm guessing this is
what the business was called fresh least
eased yeah I'm a little bit uh
overwhelmed at the moment is to say the
least cause I definitely got clothing
for the rest of my life I think here and
we traded it for a gaming PC of course
that I didn't put together for that
money I put that together of course
cheaper than what I traded the value of
that gaming PC for but they've
essentially valued all this at $14,000
dollars again which is like 10,000 u.s.
but I don't think like realistically
you'd be looking at at least you know
half that maybe a quarter and I'm still
coming out well ahead of what I traded
that gaming PC for is just unbelievable
like I haven't even unpacked all this
stuff fully it's just stuff you know
hoodie after hoodie insured after shirt
jumper after jump two just stacked on
top of everything there's just so much
so much clothing here what are you doing
mate I'm pinching myself why is that to
see if I'm not dreaming so I've got you
some food now dab in
do you know what this is sushi hey yeah
thanks right if you've ever wondered why
I mispronounce words you've just found
out the reason dad man your clothing is
looking pretty outdated they're kind of
like an old-school pentium d what do you
say we we get you clothed up with some
fresh new clothing yeah she's ago I
might but I think it's time to get me
stitched up as well what do you say we
could put a bit you want to wear a hat
don't put that on just you know looks
pretty good
so you got that one you just saw it on
that one you got the beanie okay
and it's yeah that's extra-large you
wanna check that on and what else do you
need yeah and that one's extra-large you
want to chuck that on all right now go
change over oh that is looking amazing
if this isn't closing fashion I don't
know what is mate you are looking you're
looking like you got RTX on right there
please how do you feel right now dab in
I feel like a new man maybe you're
looking just absolutely Schmidty right
and it's tell you what that's some top
quality clothes you got on right there
it's the best I've ever had but it mean
all this stuff here here's all the
singular items we've sorted them all out
and of course we're packing up all the
duplicates there's just so much clothes
I didn't realize when I first got 7 tubs
and I thought okay there's not gonna be
that much at all but this is just ending
up to be like more than I bargained for
and I mean some of the price tags on
this stuff like 50 Aussie dollars which
would be like 35 USD I don't think
that's like what people would pay for it
but I mean I'd say like half of that
would definitely be reasonable so I mean
maybe it's like 7000 ozzie dollars worth
of clothes like I think that would be
sort of an easy estimate because it is
really high quality gear so there are
all these guys this was just one epic
journey where it ended up being really
really cool I mean I got all this
clothing now that I probably got way
more than I bargained for and it sold
top quality stuff I mean I look like a
rapper at the moment so we was will
break something down for you guys yes
but here's the thing with this I've
already done a video on doing trade ins
with pcs trading stuff can be a really
good option a lot of the times though
I'd say like literally like 95% of the
time you're gonna get people wanting to
trade like things that you don't need
like an old pair of shoes or a toolbox
or something like that but this time
around I just took a look at it and the
person sent over all these sheets with
all the pricing on it and I was like wow
okay this could be something and so then
I asked dad man and he was just over the
moon he's like yeah let's do this
because he's all about that alternative
stuff and we went and picked it up and
dad man made that call he's like yep
we're getting this I think as soon as we
saw the jeans and the quality of those
jeans we knew like we had a good
opportunity here like it wasn't cheap
clothing it's all like expensive stuff
printed on the front and the back and
they even threw in a lot of cool extras
like those two watches there's the solar
panels spindle things and the best thing
I like I think is now my new sale price
docket which I can now when I'm selling
a gaming PC I can just put like a sale
price sticker on it and sort of like
mark down the PC if it hasn't sold so
that's pretty cool we've also got hats
beanies and just a lot of other stuff
even shoelaces and the list goes on with
this deal and now I guess I've got all
the business cards too I haven't even
checked the website yet but I'll see if
that's still up and running if it is
it's kind of weird because I didn't get
transferred ownership of that but
this was definitely a liquidation sale
and I mean I picked up all the goods and
surprisingly it's all men's clothing so
I guess I can use this for a long time
but I actually just want to give back so
if there's people who need some clothes
on the Gold Coast and good quality
clothes
hit me up I'm more than happy to give
away a lot of this stuff I'd ultimately
like just to get back the money that I
had on the gaming PC but after that I
just give away all the rest of the stuff
that'd be really cool but I can't stress
enough getting into stuff like this how
exciting it is I really really enjoyed
this one it was like a good break away
from the Maine Tech and all that stuff
even though we used a gaming PC which is
tech related it was just so cool to have
a new experience like this and
especially share that with my family and
they sort of agreed that it was really
good trading and for instance my brother
is usually like you know very
conservative in the way he does deals
and he was like yeah this is some pretty
good stuff you definitely got a good
deal here Brian so that was awesome to
see I mean let us know in the comments
guys what you think some of the best
merch is do you think a lot of this
stuff is a bit cheesy or a bit targeted
towards different generations or which
generation because I mean I'm just over
the moon and I haven't done anything
with dad man for a while so it's just
such a cool experience we had so many
lols but anyway I've got to pack up a
heap of clothes now and there's also
another bonus from all this and that's
that we've got all the clothing racks
and stuff like that as well as those
storage tubs so there's just a whole lot
of extra value thrown into this deal and
man I didn't know the power of a gaming
PC I guess people are just that hungry
for gaming pcs that they're willing to
trade a whole clothing business for one
nowadays I mean that's some crazy stuff
when my friend he sells pcs locally he
said people are really hungry for gaming
pcs I didn't know they were that hungry
for a gaming PC this one really blew me
away how how desperate people are just
to get on some games I think the PC I
traded them they were telling me about
playing for tonight and I'll seem to
myself well NRT X 20
he's definitely going to be playing for
tonight there's no question about that
so hopefully they play some other games
that could utilize the extra graphics
performance of that r-tx 2070 but I mean
at least at the end of the day they got
a really nice gaming PC
I got a heap of new clothes dad man's
all kitted out now he picked out some of
his favorite clothes and it was just an
exciting journey but of course guys if
you're going to do trade-ins like this
and stuff be very careful I mean when me
and Dad man first rocked up there was
like four dudes in a garage and men me
and a man looked at each other and real
kind of like what's gonna go down here
so we did it during the day I wouldn't
recommend doing trades like this at
nighttime or anywhere sketchy or
anything like that so do be very careful
if you're gonna do trade-ins and just
sort of like talk to the person a lot
make sure there's no desperation in the
way they're talking because when I first
got this deal organized I let the person
sit for a couple of days because I was
like look I'm interested but I'm a
little bit busy today and then I said to
the next day I'm a little bit busy
tomorrow and that would just really calm
so you know they weren't desperate it
wasn't like they were looking for like
that you know quick fix and I said to
them okay can we tee it up for Saturday
and they were like yeah definitely let's
tee that up and then we swapped all the
clothes around and for the gaming PC and
we were all sorted now so that was a
cool trade and definitely the most
interesting trade in and probably one of
the most interesting videos I've ever
done in my life I hope you guys enjoyed
this whole journey if you did then be
sure to hit that like button also let us
