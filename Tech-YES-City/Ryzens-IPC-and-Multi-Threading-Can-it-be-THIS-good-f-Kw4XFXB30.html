me in the last 12 hours and it involves
two photos of what looks like the six
core 12 threaded and rising 1600 x at
roughly 3.5 6 gigahertz then another
slide showing us cpu-z benchmark score
now before we get into this video I will
say that this is strictly theorycrafting
so the calculations I make here today in
this video will be based on the
assumption that these photos are correct
of course they could be faked which
would make this video completely null
and void though they do actually look
the JIT and let's take a look at why I
think aim DS new architecture could be
either within arm's reach of Intel's
latest IPCC on cabbie Lake or possibly
even better than the first type we see
here shows the CPU that has six cores
and 12 threads which means that AMD will
be taking advantage of a technology
called simultaneous multi-threading the
same thing that Intel uses with their
xeon i 3i seven and now pentium desktop
CPUs under the label hyper threading it
essentially splits the physical core
into two logical cores and allows more
of that physical core to then be
utilized by the set application in this
cpu-z benchmark photo we get a glimpse
of AMD six core 1600 X actually possibly
having more efficient SMT technology and
we calculate this by relating my i7 7700
K clocked at 5.1 gigahertz to this same
benchmark where we can see that this
total score of eleven thousand and
seventy eight divided by the single
threaded score gives us a total score of
roughly four point three two now divide
that by a further eight we get a score
of roughly zero point five four and that
is how much each thread is processing
relative to a single thread in other
words the higher this score the more
efficient the multi-threading is now
when we cast this same calculation for
the 1600 X we then get a score of six
point six for dividing that by 12 gives
us 0.55 which is slightly higher than
intel's i7 7700 k and also for good
measure I will quickly throw in the
results of my i7 6800 k clocked at four
point one gigahertz which scored zero
point five one
- the 7700 K so SMT on AMD side is
already looking to be very impressive
now comes the best part the IPC aka
instructions per cycle or zeros and ones
process per one unit of Hertz when we
look at this single threaded score we do
see a score of eighteen hundred and
eighty eight which is slightly lower
than my i7 6800 k Broadwell each chip
which scored nineteen hundred and
seventy six however relating to the
other picture we can see that the clock
speed is only at three point five six
gigahertz so calculating some math here
gives us an IPC that would actually be
better than Intel's cabbie Lake
architecture that is the i7 7700 K by
roughly five point five percent if the
single threaded benchmark was performed
at this speed however since it is a 1600
X and AMD themselves have confirmed that
these X CPUs do indeed turbo-boost
themselves given the right cooling
especially when single threaded
benchmarks are performed it is then safe
to assume that even at a worst case
scenario clock speed of say four point
two gigahertz it would put this CPU
roughly only ten point six percent
behind Intel's latest architecture in
terms of IPC or at worst intel's
campbell lake architecture is eleven
point eight percent faster whichever way
you want to look at it which given the
room at price of the six core twelve
threaded 1600 x from AMD makes this cpu
easily one of the best value for money
CPUs that will hit the market in 2017
furthermore if the single threaded
performance does indeed boost higher
than the multi-threaded clock speeds
then our previous estimate of how well
am these multi threading technology
scales is again a worst-case scenario
and that was compared against an Intel
CPU that had the same clock speeds
across all caused which means that the
multi-threaded performance could be all
the way from better to much better than
Intel's though again this is all theory
crafting but in my opinion it is the
most exciting and relative pre-release
benchmark leak we have seen thus far one
thing for certain is that I will have
benchmarks and tests ready for you guys
though honestly I think this is one
rumor that is starting to carry a lot of
good weight to it and hopefully it is
going to be a very impressive CPU lineup
from AMD in 2017
you know guys if you enjoyed this video
then be sure to leave a like and if you
dislike the video then be sure to slam
that dislike button and let me know in
the comments section below will you be
getting a rising CPU and motherboard
combo if so what combo will you be going
for I'm bursting forward to the B 356
called combo
I think that's gonna just absolutely
kick ass anyway guys I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
