2017 and I'm with Josh how you doing man
I'm doing real good man yourself doing
pretty well actually want one of those
gangster hats if you if you go on for us
oh there we go say okay let's take a
look at the products y'all 2017 Computex
coverage Patek yes
City was voted by MSI and course then
for a limited time only you can get a
free copy of Ghost Recon wildlands luxe
edition with any purchase of an MSI
product click the link in description
below to find out more so here we are
guys the first product we are looking at
is the cooler master half they're
bringing it back and Josh do you want to
tell us a little bit more about this
product alright so the half the H 500 P
this is all about getting maximum
airflow it comes with Jools 20
centimeter front fans that coming with
the case and that will just pump it
right through you can also run Julie's
at the top as well or as we've got here
triples with the 120 so it's all about
getting that maximum airflow so this
one's designed for air flow and of
course to 200 mil fans included that
that is really impressive what are we
looking at though in terms of pricing so
in terms of pricing we're looking at 179
AUD so that's just going to hit that
beautiful sweet spot and it's going to
be coming in in time for Christmas as
well so it was 139 USD but that's what
tempered glass all round two fans
included and of course down the bottom
you also get a power supply shroud right
correct and that can actually be removed
as well so if that if the shroud isn't
quite your thing you can take it out but
most of us who like the clean sleek look
you've got to keep that baby in there
especially for someone like me man I'm
using cheap power supplies and I use
cable extensions on a budget and of
course coming into the price it is
coming in at you can expect some pretty
good aesthetics on a budget right oh
hell yeah man it's all about them it's
all about demo sakes all right just like
this hat so now we're over at the cosmos
700 P this thing is a beast you want to
tell us a little bit more about this
thing right so this is the first case to
market with curved tempered glass side
panels and it's also got integrated RGB
lighting as well so it basically you can
make it yours with is beautiful
colors and just a slick looking piece of
you know case beauty yeah but what are
we talking about in expandability this
thing is huge are we looking at extended
ATX 360 480 ml rads what a light man so
this is an ultra talent so EA T X it's
got all it can fit a full decked out
system multiple hard drives multi you
know graphics cards this is about having
the ultimate build this is it C 700
people see 700 P guys you heard of
yourselves curved tempered glass
something I've never seen before
also what about the thickness of that
tempered glass hey baby there's enough
thickness everyone's going to be happy
here we are now with the last of the
cases on display the new concepts this
is the master box q 300 T but this one
doesn't have any pricing or availability
yet right that's right because the Q
series at the moment is in conceptual
development so we've gone through looked
at a few different stylings and looking
at ways that we can push it through into
different levels of the market so
starting off with a very sore
ordinary-looking one through through
this crazy-looking beast here I'm going
to say I like the crazy-looking one
straightaway so they really do they got
that generally I like the crazy ones and
they like me too but we look at we go
through the progression here we've got a
small case with nothing on at the bare
bones then we've got you can the mods
you can do to it and then we end up with
a full-fledged sort of like space-age
looking case and I got to say I like the
Q 300 T design so guys let us know in
the comments section below are you
digging this kind of progression and
customization by coulomb Isis because I
certainly am Singh and I'm liking what I
see here and Josh is there anything else
in terms of customization that's unique
to this case so essentially with this
case what you could do if you can't buy
the big boys straightaway you could go
in and get the lower end solution and
then later by the additional you know
add-ons to then change its form and
function okay so if you struggling for
the rent this week but you still want to
buy the case you can still get there
you've got to pay back your loans then
you can sort of still cool the mice are
still looking after us normal folk right
we got you so here we are we are at the
master keys keyboard section and what's
the new products coming out with cooler
master in 2017 from me
all right so homie we've got the Muskies
Pro s RGB so that's obviously full RGB
backlighting we've also got the Muskies
s that's a TK l solution and then we've
also got the MS 120 which is a sort of
membrane slash mechanical solution it
still has that clicky feel and it's rad
yeah I definitely I tried that before
and I was shocked I was really shocked
they've got the MS 120 keyboard which it
feels like a mechanical keyboard then it
isn't a mechanical keyboard but it has
so much consistency there's no flex in
the keys when you're moving them very
consistent not just in the typing
experience but when you're also pushing
the keys down they're not shaking around
so I was really surprised that this
thing was like mechanical feel but is
still membrane but of course that's
going to bring the cost down right do
totally it doesn't kill the wallet and
that's really important because we want
people to be able to enjoy that
mechanical feel without being worried
about the price point I noticed besides
that as well we have the master keys F
and that was also integrating pbt caps
for $80 I believe yeah do it is tight it
is just a nice price point quality
solution and that's what we're really
looking at is really bumping up the
quality to touch the feels the
experience so what basically what you're
trying to say is on the keyboard front
cooler masters now taking care of
gangsters ah dude we got game we got
game there we go so here we go with the
MS 120 we're looking at a included mouse
which actually feels really good when
you use it but also the best thing about
this is if you are in Australia you can
get this thing for 99 AUD for both the
keyboard and the mouse so that's really
bringing down the price really giving
you guys a great feel on both the
keyboard and mouse for under a hundred
bucks so we got coming in here next is
the mm 5:30 and the mm 520 both have
Pixar sensors in them up to 12,000 dpi
of course you get Omron switches
included texturized feel on the side
which of course does grip your fingers
quite well and then you've also got a
grip here for claw grip so this one here
is palm grip this one beside it is for
claw grip I kind of like to call the MMO
grip if you guys have used these mice
you'll find this design is very popular
for MMO users so on that note they do
look pretty good with a pricing of
around 79 AUD and 59
USD so we're now over at the cooler
section for coolermaster where they have
two new concepts of cooler designs do
you want to run us through this UFO
design which actually is a top-down cool
which I'm actually a really big fan of
yeah man well you know not everyone can
fit a massive tower cooler into that
system so what we need is a top-down
solution so the UFO concept is named
appropriately so because it can and does
look a bit like a UFO but full copper
core and copper flower design coming out
of the base and it's also got the
integrated RGB so you can have the
colors that suit your build so there we
go
all copper guys RGB as well for
cosmetics and this thing will do a nice
job if you're on a budget and that
top-down cooler again helping with vrm
if you're on a budget too so this is why
I really like top-down cause even though
your CPU temperature doesn't really get
the lowest compared to a full-fledged
dedicated cooler your overall your VR
Em's getting a little bit cooler so 24/7
overclock on a budget are generally
better in my opinion so now we've got
this big boy here the master air make a
3d LV concept what is so special about
this thing besides being an absolute
mammoth well what's so special about
this is it's got a fully integrated 3d
360 degree heat pipe so it's going from
base here through one tower up across
the top where you can see the heat pipes
here through the second tower and then
into the base again so that is
optimizing the full cooling potential
and also has the integrated our RGB
lighting as well two fans and a third in
the middle there we go guys RGB for
cosmetic and full revolutionised 360
degree heat pipes which is going to be
really interesting to see how this thing
performs in the real world but as again
we've got really no availability on
pricing or release dates yet so let us
know in the comments guys if you like
either of these coolers now another
really cool thing at the cooler master
booth is they are now teaming up with
custom cable designs and they are simply
sending the schematics of their power
supplies over to different vendors and
now if you guys want to go work with
those vendors for custom cables you can
go get the calcine cables from any of
these guys and they'll work with the
cooler master power supply so there it
is for the cooler master 2017
at Computex unfortunately I am leaving
the booth so I'm going to lose my
gangster status right yeah man I'm sorry
it just it's what happens you leave here
you no longer cool it so I'm no longer
cool guys but I will be telling you that
some of these products I saw today were
very cool very inspiring so make sure
you go in the comments let us know what
you think of this and I meant I had an
awesome time in it so thanks man
absolute pleasure over you thank you see
you guys bye
like totally so here we are also with
the 25th anniversary edition of the
Coolermaster cases yet correct man
correct and so you know one of the big
standout ones was the ATC is full
aluminium acrylic window that came out
back in 2000 then we had evolved through
to the CM stocker stocker then went
further and we've now got the master
series along with the cosmos it's rad
this is probably right here the coolest
case I have seen and yet it is like a
steampunk case and I want to steal a
class you'll go first or come out a
