coming back to you guys today with a
video on shadow play which is a new
add-on extension released in the 331
drivers from the video now essentially
what this is is a gameplay capturing
software and it's only unfortunately
it's only for the six GD x 6 and 7
series since they actually have a
hardware h.264 encoder built onto the
graphics cards now the good news is is
that if you can use this software it is
damn impressive and today I'm going to
be specifically comparing a 30-second
clip of shadow play versus a 30-second
clip of Dxtory now the first thing to
remember is it is essentially it's an
unfair comparison because one is only
720p and the other 1080p but I want you
guys to pay a particular attention to
the smoothness of the gameplay footage
and you know and also the file sizes i'm
going to say before we get into the
gameplay footage the file sizes are
extremely small and this is even at
1080p at 30 frames per second the file
size is just small and they're beautiful
laga dress was about three times bigger
and that was only half the quality at
720p so at 1080p six times thus while
sizes this was the logarithmic kodak
with Dxtory anyway let's jump into the
gameplay footage and after that i'll
will explain a little bit more about
shadow play and i'll talk about the
benefits of it and also the benefits you
know there's still benefits to be had
from using software like Dxtory anyway
let's move on to the gameplay footage
noun 1 e ki a he's gone instead of back
on bonus visual friendlies and telling
us
target towel and put a fix target
destroyed check on thomas buff radar is
down changing he's gone transitioning
so there you have it hopefully you guys
notice the difference between the two
gameplay footage 'as i certainly did I
thought the shadow play gameplay footage
was a little bit smoother than the
dxtory footage now also will say that
both of these were recorded at 30 frames
per second and they both you know since
YouTube only allows the 30 FPS limit on
their videos now we'll say that the
limitations of shadow play is that it
doesn't and at the moment it doesn't
allow you to record multiple audio
inputs at the same time it also doesn't
have the feature set that dxtory it
currently has but I will say the
performance hit on both dxtory and
shadow play was next to nothing I didn't
notice it they'll both really good
they're both lightweight programs for
recording gameplay I will say the Dxtory
does offer more options I mean you can
mocks audio which basically you know
separate the audio from the video so
you've got a little bit more options
that edit things as well so Dxtory still
is a good program but the biggest
benefit of shadow play let me go back to
shadow play now is that it's free it's
smoother and the file sizes are
literally a third I think know if you
comparing them quality the same quality
the same quality the file sizes are a
six of the size both of both lieutenant
at 1080p so that's a really good thing
for shadow play it's really lightweight
it's really good for someone who maybe
wants to get into recording gameplay
footage and doesn't know if they'd like
it or not it's also really good for
someone like me who records gameplay
footage and then records audio after
they record the gameplay footage so this
is going to be my new recording program
of choice now for recording gameplay
footage for you guys and also you
beginning the gameplay footage in 1080p
so anyway hopefully you guys enjoyed
this quick comparison obviously there's
probably a few points that I did miss
some big points so you guys can put them
in the comments if you like if you like
this quick comparison the please give it
a thumbs up and also i'll catch you guys
soon so sorry i haven't been given you
guys videos much hun benton i came down
with this really really bad flu so I've
been pretty bed bound for the last few
days and anyway I'll get you guys out
some more videos very soon so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and I'll catch
you soon with another video peace out
for now brandy
