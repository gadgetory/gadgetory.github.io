call because today we've got deals too
many 01 bat attacks again before we get
on with this episode we'll say be
careful of what country you live in and
the import taxes associated with that
country I know some countries judge high
import taxes even on low value items
i'll put a link in the description below
you can kind of get an idea so hopefully
you're not buying something and getting
hit with an unexpected hi now moving on
to the first year here was at the a lula
f 20 12 gaming professional keyboards
like the names pretty long but now it's
got blue switches it's 10 Keeler's it's
black it looks good so it's going to be
great for traveling and also if it's
your first mechanical keyboard it's
really inexpensive to the 26 pounds it's
about it says theres forty-two a strand
of thickened USDA be about like 32 US
dollars and it's got free international
postage so anyone in the world can get
one of these keyboards on a budget so
the seconds worth of the money the next
item we've got here is going over to
Aliexpress now if you guys have wanted a
boon for gaming mic which you can just
attach to a headset like it was straight
it in this a photo here so you just get
any pair of headphones attach this
microphone e now the gaming headset
essentially if you guys never wanted to
pay 30 dolls for the broom pro you can
now go and I'll Express and get this
thing so nine dollars fifty that's with
free postage friggin so cheap for a
extension like this and I mean it might
be a knockoff but I'm sure it's just as
good since a lot of the stuff made in
China anyway so friggin deal for nine
dollars 50 and then the next people got
up here with you next to 710 this is an
IPS panel 1440p 27 inches and it's gone
for two hundred and five dollars so
frickin sheep now the good thing is is
that if you're in America it's free
shipping but if you anywhere else in the
world I think it's like 35 dollars
shipping so still even a freaking deal
if you're anywhere else in the world so
that's the international deals wrapping
up here moving on to the US we've got a
pair of high finally headphones from
three hundred twenty dollars all the way
to 60 dolls so if you want to get that
be mode of room for my l'express in not
all 50 cobble with these headphones for
60 bucks you're going to have yourself
one hell of a gaming headset
for about evony USB so really good deal
there and even some places in the world
like a straight you can get the sink
ships 14 USB so it's a frickin deal help
here for the people in the states we've
got here the X 5677 now I have to give
them kudos to people on the taxi DTV
forums they mentioned this cpu and 445
box man it is a really good buyers for
cause eight threads now the good thing
about it is they probably thing at brain
it's on the x58 platform and I know that
it's on the x58 platform blood it's
clocked really high so 3.46 kickers on
the LGA 1366 now the x58 motherboard are
expensive however these server
motherboards on this platform are really
cheap and since it's got a higher clock
speed you won't need it overclock it you
just couple it with some cheap ECC
memory and you're going to have yourself
you know maybe put in a gtx 1050 or 1050
TI or even an rs4 7e you're gonna have
yourself one hell of the cpu on a budget
really good deal especially for 45 bucks
ok you were very don't give much better
here now doesn't next be able to the
audio-technica AD 500 texts these are
down from 170 dollars all the way to
eighty dollars so these are open air
headphones or open back headphones and
they're going to be amazing for games
like csgo where you need good
positioning and at eighty dollars
they're really good headphone for that
price now if you like graphics cards
we've got here the RX 488 gigabyte
edition going for two hundred twenty
dollars but you can also get a
twenty-dollar rebate if you're in the
state and that makes us think two
hundred dollars which for an RX for 80
with 8 gigabytes of Gd are five memory
on it it's a friggin deal so get on that
if you need a graphics card as it's
pretty damn good price now moving on to
the last field in the states we've got
here the NOC shore d14 cooler this thing
is still on sale for $66 it's a really
big cooler and it's one of the best out
there for air cooling so the 66 built
Solar's you can pretty much get the
be-all and end-all of air cooling as the
friggin spiels got two fans it's just
huge so you also have to make sure if
you buy this thing you've got the roomba
fitted in your case now i'm going to
australia we got a lot of deals down
south here we've got the LG 27 inch
model that's for 4k its IPS and now it's
going for 585 AUD now you can actually
put in a coupon or voucher code
here commit 20 and you get twenty
percent off so you do the math I've like
an almost 120 bucks off this thing
you're getting this thing for four
hundred and sixty dollars for a 4k IPS
panel and it's 27 inches so it's huge
double specs it's going to be awesome
not just for gaming before watching
movies create content creation as well
friggin bargain and also if you want to
grab scout a couple this monitor with
you got the GTX 1080 for the win
editions go on for a thousand aud pretty
expensive but you also get that twenty
percent off so you get this thing for
800 australian dollars which brings it
really close to that American pricing
it's not a little bit cheaper prophecy
EVGA model so it's going to cool pretty
well I don't know if this still has the
thermal problem on it but there is an
easy fix to that thermal problem but at
this price it is really cheap if you
don't want to go with that you can go
with the msi armored edition this is a
thousand and fifty dollars and you can
still put that twenty percent and get
this thing for near eight hundred
dollars so really good deals now in XP
oh we got here to gtf 1060 this is a
gigabyte edition it's going for around
about two hundred eighty dollars if you
whack that twenty percent code in there
and feel enough to make a cooler on it
should do a fine job especially Italian
defeat gaming and then we've got a cpu
want a couple of cpu with that we go up
to G 45-60 not so much a deal as it is
just a really good price for the CPU 78
australian dollars i recently did two
videos on this thing it is really damn
good for the money from you might and
give $78 freaking amazing you probably
get it from other stores as well but if
you want a motherboard a couple of years
but make sure you're able to update the
buyer to you can get the h110 again for
twenty percent off so you can get this
thing for like 70 something dollars
shipped to your door freaking deal now
visiting all the way over to the UK but
got the palais geforce gtx 1050 TI store
next edition so this thing's going for
137 pounds and even if you do the
exchange rate it seems pretty expensive
but apparently for the UK that's a
pretty good price now if you guys are
after a water cooler this one actually
isn't a sale item as much as it is just
a decent price its sixty pounds as a 240
middle cooler and actually used it in a
recent build and did a really good job
of cooling so i can recommend this
