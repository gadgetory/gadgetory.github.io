are in a higher price bracket than they
were a couple of years ago and
especially when we look at our x4
seventies are x4 80s and then the
subsequent 5 70s and 5 80s that were a
really good value for people who wanted
to get into PC gaming in the mid-range
level and get good FPS especially at
1080p but recently there have been huge
deals going around on our x5 70s and 5
80s they're being offloaded by miners
and I myself happen to pick up to our x5
80s for extremely good price and these
prices were about 42 USD H and this made
it an exceptionally good buy and I've
got me thinking well if you are looking
for an upgrade and you already have one
of these cards or if you wanted to get
into PC gaming and get really good FPS
out of your GPUs would it be a good
option to crossfire two of these are x5
80s well today we're going to take a
look at these two GPUs in crossfire
against a single card and also compare
it to something like a 16 60 TI
which is a very popular choice on the
new market in terms of a mid-range
graphics card then we're gonna see if
crossfire is indeed worth your money
but of course first these graphics cards
of course are looking a little bit dirty
so we're to give them some tech yes
loving but instead of just showing you
guys the b-roll we're just going to give
you the before and the after
he's me talking so the good news is is
that there's not much good news except
you've got some RGB on the side of both
these graphics cards now we just
finished up the crossfire tests and the
power consumption was quite high of
course with crossfire and that was going
across 192 watts for the 16 60 T I got
the 61 degrees then the single rx 580
got the 63 degrees
I got 230 watts total system draw and
then we had 63 degrees yet again on both
cards but the fan speeds were a little
bit higher 57% so seems to like that
temperature at least on these rx5 ATS
here of sitting around 63 degrees in a
24 degree ambient sea environment now
the power consumption on both RX 5 ATS
ended up reaching about 420 to 430
what's it was averaging out there so it
does use roughly 200 watts more than a
single rx 580 from the wall and this is
on a pretty good power supply I'm using
the HX 1500 Platinum so it's kind of
like a best-case scenario here for the
cards in terms of power consumption but
let's get on to the best-case scenario
for this crossfire in these five games
so we tested out here today f1 2019
shadow of the Tomb Raider strange
Brigade Tom Clancy's the division 2 and
also Far Cry a new dawn and I think
shadow of the Tomb Raider is probably
the best-case scenario for this GPU
where it scored 95 average FPS and then
versus a single card I got 53 average
FPS so the crossfire was working quite
well in this game when we cranked max
settings at 1080p the 66 TTI of course
gave out a very solid score with 74
average FPS but the minimums on the
crossfire ended up being 30 which was
weaker than a single card and this is
one problem we'll talk about that after
we talk about all the benchmarks here of
crossfire but we'll move on to the next
best case in our and that was strange
Brigade where we got 145 average FPS 65
one percent low and 60.1% low versus 114
on the 16 60 TI 90 and 89
the move over to a single card 81 58 and
55 so despite having a lot higher
average FPS its 1% point on assemblers
we're marginally better than that of a
single card moving over to Tom Clancy's
the division to 1080p ultra settings
presets orissan dx12 getting better
results on a single rx 580 then we were
on to our x5 80s so we've got 44 average
FPS 35 and 31 10.1% lows versus 50 40
and 35 and then we got 71 52 and 32 on
the 16 60 TI we were able to file cried
new dawn these scaling really wasn't
that good in this particular title where
we had 69 average FPS 52 a minimum
versus 92 and 60 minimum and the 1660 T
I was getting 94 and 61 and getting
obviously a better result while using a
lot less power indicating that the RX 5
eighties when they are in crossfire they
run at lower clocks than that of the
single card which is able to reach its
highest boost clock the last title we
have up here is f1 2019 and this was
similar to Tom Clancy's the division 2
where we saw a 1080p Ultra setting 70
and then 51 and 19 1.0 m scentless
versus 64-46 and 17 so again performing
worse than that of a single card than
the 1660 T I was getting 90 7471 so
these results pretty much show with
crossfire it's really not worth it in
2019 I mean you can get better results
in a single card and I guess shadow of
the Tomb Raider and strange Brigade show
that the scaling was good but it's still
not anywhere near double the FPS you'd
get of a single card also on that note
when we look at going across different
titles we sometimes got worse FPS than
that of a single card the 1660 TI of
course being a single end solution being
out there on the market for 280 USD is
not a bad play in terms of its power
efficiency in the FPS it gives out a
single rx 580 in the used market of
course just being phenomenal value for
money and giving out some really good
FPS especially if we drop the settings
here today but the reason I wanted to
max those graphical settings was so we
could not run into any CPU bottlenecks
as for the 4 gigabytes of vram on the RX
580 at 1080p it didn't
really any problems except for maybe f1
2019 when we see that the 1660 Ti is
doing comparatively better with the
17.1% lows than it is in both the
crossfire and the single card setups so
looking at those results we can see it's
honestly not good at all for crossfire
and SLI as well invidious kind of shied
away from that and the reasons being
these technologies at least crossfire I
believe it started in 2005 and at the
time it was like wow we can get more FPS
we can double up our GPUs and have a
better gaming experience but it wasn't
until after it came out there was a lot
of reports of stuttering micro
stuttering and a lot of people just said
look this technology is not working as
good as a single GPU and then of course
there went to high-speed cameras and
they found that yes there was indeed
stuttering and then AMD subsequently
introduced a thing called frame pacing
which did help smooth out the problems
nvidia at least in 2013 at least with
the gtx 780 TX 789
and so that's when nvidia started to shy
away from sli and since then we've seen
this trend with massive single GPUs
because I guess companies like AMD and
NVIDIA are too afraid to really focus on
crossfire because it requires a lot of
extra driver development in terms of
getting the games to work right and as
we see in the titles here crossfire ran
worse than it did with a single GPU and
then the games that it did work we
weren't getting anywhere near a hundred
percent scaling from two cards but to
further complicate the matter crossfire
and SLI also had its fair share of
problems outside of games where driver
issues would cause flickering screens
and other sorts of problems that would
just make it frustrating for people on
these setups over a long time period so
it's easy to see why both these
companies have sort of shied away from
it I mean at least with the AMD side and
using crossfire this time it was really
easy to get working you just put both
the GPUs in and stall all the drivers
restart the machine and then double
check in the Whatman software to make
sure that the crossfire is enabled you
also should make sure frame pacings
turned on but even then in a you know
gene heaven when I was doing the power
consumption results we'd
still see that the frame meter was
showing some very odd results and it
really just left me here scratching my
head though it was pretty cool to see
that there was the crossfire logo that
you could turn on itself that particular
game or application supported this
technology it let you know in the top
right hand corner that it's turned on
but now I'm just going to give it to you
guys straight and that is when it comes
to crossfire SLI you can extract extra
performance especially if you're doing
what I did here today and getting the
cards for really cheap but I'd only ever
recommend doing this if you played a
single title and you knew that that game
supported crossfire or SLI so for
instance if you're just playing shadows
of the Tomb Raider yeah
crossfire works pretty well in that
title and if that's all you really play
from day to day then yeah it could be
worth your money in time but if you're
playing a variety of games especially
like I do I like to play different PC
titles here from time to time
I wouldn't recommend crossfire
whatsoever or SLI I just think it's too
much of a headache for gamers who want
to play a variety of title but at least
with the PC game as I know and myself
included we play multiple titles on the
PC so I guess the majority of people in
2019 couldn't really benefit from SLI or
crossfire but it doesn't mean to say
that it's useless it's just it's limited
use case scenario the five titles I
tested here today I just randomly picked
them but they're all pretty much what
would be considered triple-a titles in
that they're released from big game
developers when it comes to indie
developers or smaller titles with
companies from lower budgets you can
pretty much guarantee that SLI or
crossfire isn't really gonna work
properly at all now I know there's also
people out there that'll tell me you
should mod the config files and in
particular titles you can get crossfire
SLI to work but really when it comes
down to I do hustle here on the channel
I do sell PCs locally to people and I
would never tell someone to do that it's
just a waste of time especially when you
get a driver update or a game update
it's gonna completely ruin all those
previous settings and that's about it
when it comes to coupling two GPUs
together in 2019 with PC games it's
really something that's get
less and less popular and the reasons
are obvious as we said before even with
those 1% 0.1% lows in those titles even
when it was working properly it still
was giving a less desirable experience
so going with the single and GPU is
going to give you a lot less headaches
than going with a two GPUs set up or
even in that case sometimes you can get
three or four of these things working so
you could expect even more headaches
without aside guys I hope you enjoyed
today's video if you did be sure to
smash that like button for us also let
us know in the comments section below
what you think of dual crossfire setups
and SLI do you share the same thoughts
as me or do you think differently and on
that note I'm also going to be giving
away these two rx5 ATS in the comments
section below I did promise this in the
previous video so all you have to do to
enter is hit the like button stay
subscribed and also drop a comment in
the comment section below we're gonna be
using a random comment picker to pick
out someone and then this is worldwide
I'm gonna message you directly and then
ship the GPU out to where you are so to
rx5 ATS up for grabs internationally and
there also had some tech yest loving so
you can rest assured that thing's gonna
work better than you and with that aside
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
