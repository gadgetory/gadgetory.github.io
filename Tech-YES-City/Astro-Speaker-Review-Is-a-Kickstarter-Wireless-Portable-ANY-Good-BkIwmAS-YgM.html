Kickstarter product that is yet to be
released and this is the Astro speaker
from the company for tree labs ladies
and gentlemen welcome back to tech yes
city this is brian coming to you guys
today with a unique review because i
haven't reviewed a portable speaker yet
and also i haven't reviewed a product
that's yet to be released so today we'll
get two birds off in one stone so went
relapse asked me if i wanted to take a
look at their bluetooth astro speaker I
said sure as I was actually in the
market for buying a portable speaker
however today we'll take a look at what
you get in the box we'll take a look at
the features of this unit then i will
give you guys a listening test and I'll
tell you my subjective thoughts and
opinions about the astro speaker so as
soon as you have the box that comes in
recycled packaging with a charger also
an auxiliary cable and the unit itself
now the unit self takes about two hours
to charge up fully or at least in my
case it did and I got about 12 hours
usage out of this device which was great
however looking at what powers this
speaker we've got 250 ml neodymium
speakers there and also in the middle
we've got a rectangular speaker which
powers directly for bass also there is
no bass port there and this is
surrounded in an aluminium casing you
also have around that silicon casing as
well so this thing is very durable and
very sturdy but we'll get on a little
bit to that later you also got to the
side there aluminium ring hole there
which holds the button and then on the
top day you've got a power button which
is made of aluminium as well and has a
light to let you know if it's on or off
also holding down the unit for two
seconds will turn the unit on with a
noise to let you know it's turned off
and vice versa to let you know that it's
turned off now looking at the dimensions
of this unit I managed to measure 202
millimeters by 91 millimeters tall x 41
millimeters thick so quickly back onto
the unit itself it has a 10 watt rms
amplifier built in also tree labs have
made a big point of their pure audio
which essentially in their opinion is
getting rid of the DS
the digital signal processing and giving
you guys a more pure audio experience
however all that being said it's time to
get on to a sound test where it's easy
as with this unit just pairing up your
smartphone to the device and then you
can play any music you want that being
said though let's get on to the tests
Oh
Oh
Saul or what can I say about the
asterisk big war went real ABS sent me
this unit they wanted me to focus on the
audio quality though in my opinion it's
still lacks base even though the mids
and treble are pretty good though I
can't expect that out of a portable
speaker since it just doesn't have a 10
inch subwoofer built on it though what I
will say though is what did impress me
about this unit was the build quality I
thought it was phenomenal and it
survived a massive drop I'll show you
guys
so it's built like a tank and all in all
I really like what they're doing with
this unit in terms of the looks and the
build quality you can hang it up you can
carry it around and you can play it for
12 hours and whatnot with your friends
though if you're expecting this to
replace your 2.1 or 5.1 surround sound
system then I think you may be in the
wrong market though I will say all in
all I did like this unit I did like the
utility of the unit I thought it was
great and I thought the voices came out
really well though as for a rating I
can't really give it a rating as I don't
know what the final price exactly is
going to be if you can get this unit for
a hundred and twenty dollars then I can
recommend it though at two hundred
dollars I think this is where this unit
would start to be getting pretty
expensive especially for a portable so I
would like to see them release the set
one hundred and twenty dollars and I
think at that price it would be a
massive hit though how does it sound
compared to other portables that's
probably what you're wondering when I
went down to my local electronics store
and quickly tested out some portables
down there I found that this competed
with the bow systems which cost a lot
more money so it does a good job so
anyway guys that's about it for today if
you have any questions about the astro
speaker then please leave a comment in
the comment section below I'll put the
link to the Kickstarter campaign in the
description below for you guys and if
you like this video please give it a
thumbs up and if you haven't already
subscribed attack yes city for more news
reviews and whatever the tech stuff
that's gonna be coming at you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
