parts hunting in LA and yesterday if you
guys haven't seen it already I'll put
the link up here we scored some pretty
big deals today we're lining up a few
different deals some of them promises
from yesterday but already I've scored a
gtx 1050 for $80 so i'm gonna go pick
that up pretty soon but then after that
we're gonna go later into the evening
hopefully be picking up that i 560 400
system with ddr4 2 terabyte hard drive
motherboard cooler and all that jazz for
a hundred and eighty dollars as well as
picking up a 1050 TI for a hundred
dollars this will pretty much complete
everything but i also still need to go
hunt for possibly another power splay
and a case so we're gonna hit the road
right now get that 1050 and then see
what's after that
so we just picked up a GTX 1050 for 80
bucks while we're on the road and it's
pretty good value at that price it's not
the best price but it's certainly far
from the worst and of course if I'm
putting together some cheap pcs
something like this will always come in
handy especially at the right price and
considering we've got those OMS with
their built-in power supplies that you'd
really want to reuse especially when
we're paying 35 bucks for a power supply
so that kind of adds value when you get
signed you can just quickly fit in and
it works and it's good to go and from
here on in I'm meeting up with the
viewer actually two years ago I first
met up with him when I was in the US for
the first time his name is Vic and we're
gonna go grab a bike quickly and then
after that we might go hit up some more
deals but it's crazy in the winter here
it gets dark so early like five o'clock
it starts getting dark
so we've got a little bit of an update
here we're just about to eat some
burgers
Troy's Vick recommended that they make
really good burgers here so gonna have a
feed and we're lining up at GTX 1084 266
dollars it's on an application called
offer up and apparently that's really
good way to get deal besides that we are
picking up the deal on that eye five
sixty four hundred later today and
that's coming through we're gonna meet
the guys seven pm and they've said that
they will meet up and take the offer of
one hundred eighty dollars so I'm super
keen to go get that deal and straight
off we're gonna pick out the GTX ten v2
TI but in terms of the GT x 1080 I'm not
too sure how that's going to go down
because the guy does live at Riverside
and that's really far from anywhere in
LA itself so regardless we're gonna go
pick up that PC right now and see what's
inside I'm really curious about it they
were quickly gonna smash this down
beforehand
so we just ended up getting this deal
for the i-5 6400 that was the one that I
really wanted to pick up and we got that
for 180 cash there's also some really
good news with that but I got to wait
until the guy bought it off gets back to
us because if it all goes well and we
could get like a super mega deal out of
that so keen to hear back from that but
at the moment there is a case with some
LED fans on it we're gonna pick that up
for $35 so that's looking pretty good
cause it's right near where we're
staying
but the GTX 1050 TI the guy hasn't got
back to us yet so I'll see if I can pick
that up maybe tomorrow cuz it's all like
pretty far like la is one big city but
we'll go get that case right now that
looks like the best option
so just go back to the hotel now and
this is the $35 case we've picked up
it's got a tempered glass on the front
tempered glass on the side and three red
LED fans honestly it feels like it's a
really good case I'm really happy with
this for the money I pegs it's pretty
much brand new I don't think they've
even used it before as it's got the
stickers still on it but moving over to
the main prize here this is the ace of
desktop that we picked up just before
and this has got an i-5 6400 in it so
it's got a nice 6 gen quad core it's got
a single stick of a gigabytes of RAM so
we could upgrade this to a 16 gig system
but the best thing about this case is
since it is an eyesore OEM and you know
with some OEMs you can have a lot of
trouble if there's proprietary
connectors there's actually no real
proprietary connectors here they're even
using an FSP power supply so we can take
this power supply out of this case and
use it over there for that build with
the half so we've got two different
builds kind of getting pieced out here
but quickly going over this case stills
we've got USB three front and we've got
two SATA ports so be able to use the two
terabyte hard drive as well as an SSD in
this build and we've got front audio out
and included Wi-Fi too so really not bad
going for the money one thing I'll have
to be careful of is to also pull out
this sensor when I ditch the case
because if you don't pull out the senses
sometimes you can get error messages and
things don't work properly so pull that
out as well but really happy overall
with the deals we've got so far if I had
to piece this together we're gonna have
a absolute beast with a 1070 TI SSD new
power supply Corsair cooler hi-5 6400
and a gig ram 2 terabyte hard drive all
for about 520 so far I'm just
considering maybe putting in another a
gigabytes of ddr4 memory and maybe nice
seven and spicing things up to pretty
much make it like kind of high-end for a
budget so that's one thing I'm still
gonna think of this one here is really
straightforward this one I'm thinking of
calling this the L a bang job or the L a
BJ this is got a $20 1/2 case $55 rig
and we can reuse the hard drive and then
put in today's gtx 1050 and we'll have a
whole system here for a hundred and
fifty five bucks so this will be a
really good budget PC that we'll put
together and show you guys very soon so
here we are to close with day two and
I'm really happy because we got two
builds getting pieced out one which is a
definite go ahead the other which I'm
still a little bit conflicted about day
three will may be homed in on an i7 and
perhaps an extra a gigabytes of RAM
because we still hopefully have the
choices I will have to check that BIOS
if it can be updated to support the next
generations for instance the i7 7700 but
so far so good I mean this is a build
that is looking like it's going to be
high-end thanks to that $35 case even
though we didn't pay a whole lot for it
it actually looks really high-quality we
got a 1070 TI decent power supply SSD
hard drive everything's there so if we
add another a key about two ddr4 at an
i7 6700 then it'll just really complete
that build in my opinion make it
something special make it something
pretty much high-end especially since I
know how to overclock that 1070 TI and
make it practically a 1080 but if you
guys can let us know in the comment
section below what do you think you'd
like to see me do would you like to see
me upgrade it or just keep it as is and
go with the i-5 and eight gigabytes of
RAM because that's ready to go so we've
got two builds that are definitely
coming while we're on the road hustling
but other than that today we didn't do a
whole lot because I did do a bit of
sightseeing I did see a friend Vic who
was actually on a different application
offer up he reckons that's the whole go
in LA for getting pretty good deals I
was telling them about Facebook
marketplace and pretty much that's the
only app that I've been on so far
getting deals I have looked through
Craigslist but they haven't been as good
as the Facebook marketplace and so if
I'm getting all these deals on Facebook
marketplace I don't really need to hop
across to offer up or Craigslist just
yet but for this 6,700 I may be just
doing that seeing what I can get and
also that extra gigabytes of ddr4 I just
have to keep on the lookout for those
two upgrades also did a bit of retro
console games hunting some of the games
that I grew up on as a kid
there's this really cool place called
game dude that's where everyone seems to
go to get and all that side la has just
been an absolute blast right now I've
just been driving around having a lot of
fun
the 1050 Ti it was a little bit late so
we'll probably go pick that up tomorrow
and while we're up that way we might see
another friend just depends on sort of
organizing the times and the maps
because la is such a huge city I didn't
realize how big this place is
and still you start driving around all
these different places and when you kind
of accept a deal here I guess you kind
of got to consider which part of LA that
person is from because for instance Vic
was looking for the GTX 1080 on offer up
but when we looked at the distance it
was literally over two hours away still
within LA it was like pretty much on the
way going to Vegas so maybe when we're
going to see yes we might stop off and
get that deal if it's still available
I'm not too sure just yet this is what
hitting the road is all about you guys
you know you said in the comments before
just drop me in a jungle and I'll have a
gaming PC ready and I was pretty much
what's going on man then just drop me
anywhere and I'll figure out what's what
the locals are sell on their Starfire
peace stuff together mix and match
because the synergy we got from the
budget PC was that were able now to pull
out the FSP power play and use that in
the budget rig and that's gonna fit in
the half
really well so that $155 PC stay tuned
for that because it's gonna be some of
LA's finest
I don't guys hope you enjoyed day 2 of
the PC parts hustling if you did then be
sure to hit that like button I do have
to edit these videos down it does take
quite a while as well but day 3 we'll
see what's going on if I don't end up
picking up any of these pieces then I
will just go ahead with the builds and
you'll see it build out on the channel
not too sure what I'll do yet as I'm
mixing and matching everything doing the
hustling editing the videos and trying
to enjoy myself it's just always full-on
but I guess that's what 2018 was like
2019 is gonna be nothing different so
stay tuned and I'll catch you in the
next one also let us know in the
conversation below what your favorite
deal was thus far and I'll see you very
soon peace out for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
