meter 1.8 lens this is a nifty 50 knock
off which is actually really good
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
check yes cities Brian coming back to
you guys today with a review kind of an
unusual review of a 50 millimeter lens
from a company called yongnuo now I
usually don't do camera gear and stuff
like that however I was just blown away
by what these lens have to offer for $50
now we'll quickly get the negatives out
the way though if you are a videographer
on a budget then you will seriously more
you may wish to consider buying yourself
one of these now I got these for off
eBay for $50 and essentially what you
get for that is just a pretty much a
lens in a box and that's it with the two
caps on both sides however once you put
it on the camp you are going to be blown
away by the quality of this lens however
that being said let's get the negatives
out the way with the first negative I
can think of with this camera would be
the autofocus noise when you're locking
onto a target it is quite noisy and it
does make itself heard so if you're
someone who doesn't need noise in your
shots then you're in your video then you
may wish to consider a different lens
the second negative that I can point out
is the autofocus speed as well it is
quite slow to lock on to a target though
that being said it does lock on very
accurately and you will get a sharp
picture with these lens or at least I
did in my case the third negative I can
think of is the build quality it is
pretty light it is plasticky and it does
feel cheap however those three things
out the way with let's get on to
everything good about these lens so the
first and biggest point that I'll make
about these $50 lens is the quality of
the Baka stopping this down to 1.8 I was
just my jaw dropped when I was doing a
b-roll for my tech reviews I was like
wow this is this kind of bucket is
coming out of a $50 lens and I was
considering this or the nifty 50 then I
was looking at the nifty 50 s bucket
that's from Canon I really wasn't
impressed with the quality of the Baka
it actually looked pretty bad to me and
I'm sort of after watching a few
Hollywood flicks especially the Rock of
Ages with Tom Cruise if you guys haven't
seen that you should watch that movie
it's got some beautiful bokeh in it and
after seeing that movie I was kind of
like hey Baca is really important so if
you guys are on sort of like if you're
looking for the best Baca for the money
then I think these are
the hill so stopping this down as I said
before 21.8 just produce some really
good b-roll in my videos that I'll
shooting for my tech reviews so let's
quickly talk about sharpness er which is
another point of this lens I found these
lens in practice to be quite sharp even
at F 1.8 they still got a pretty crisp
image though when I stopped it down to
say F 3.5 to f4
I got a really crisp image then when I
compared it to my EOS 22 millimeter lens
that's on my Canon I noticed that the
Canon 22 millimeter was a little bit
sharper it has to be expected as that is
more expensive lens though let's move on
now to some other things people
wondering about what about chromatic
aberration and stuff like that well
that's starting to move into my area
where I don't know anything about that
so all's I can say is this lens is a
really good lens I'm really impressed
with it especially for fifty dollars and
I wanted to get the word out about how
good I think this lens is especially for
someone like me who's performing static
video and if you guys are in the market
for something like that then I can
highly recommend the yongnuo 50
millimeter F one point eight now if you
need to buy this lens you can get it off
eBay for round v around about fifty
dollars with Free Shipping that's what I
did and when you get it in you pretty
much just whack it on your Canon I think
they've got options for other cameras
too I'm not too sure but you whack it on
your Canon and you'll be in Bakke heaven
so if you're looking for the best pocket
for the money I can highly recommend the
yongnuo 50 millimeter 1.8 lens anyway

me I do have my new b-roll lens anyway
