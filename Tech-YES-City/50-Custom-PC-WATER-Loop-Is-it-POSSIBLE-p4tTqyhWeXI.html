for $50 let's find out
welcome back to tech yeah City this is
brian coming to you guys today with a
look at a cheap water cooling loop setup
now this is also for the CPU and the GPU
since I've been getting a lot of
requests to do something like this so
today I'm going to quickly go over how
much the parts cost where I source them
from which includes places like eBay
Amazon and also my local hardware store
and how much they cost and let's get on
with the tally
ok so now we're going to really briefly
check for a signal off this here and
since there's actually you know there's
just the colors pretty much on there
with no water going through we're gonna
have to be very quick so I'm just going
to see if there's a signal coming out
just to make sure that there is no
problem so we're going to use a little
friendly USB Drive here just and no more
problem ok so as soon as there's a
signal go on we are going to shut it off
at the main just to make sure there's no
problems
come on signals even a single hurry up
hurry up hurry up
Dayna signal yet
then we're gonna have to shut that off
is getting way too hard to touch nice to
figure this out okay so we've got the
graphics card here and the power play on
a different motherboard and CPU so we're
going to test that quickly to just rule
out one thing at a time to see what it
could be so hopefully it's not a
graphics card because that is really
good like a seal you got all the
heatsinks on there decide the cooler off
and then we've got the memory in there
as well all right cool awesome so it is
the either the motherboard of the CPU
I'm guessing it's the CPU or the
motherboard doesn't have the update on
the BIOS to support the e 50 640 so
we're going to try and put this CPU into
the other motherboard and then see if we
can get a signal if we can then we could
update the BIOS to support the new 56:40
so let's get that on the way alright so
we're going for round 2 this time
different CPU and we're going to see if
we can get a signal this time hopefully
we can just one stick and memory and
come on
please don't be a busted motherboard
yeah okay cool alright so so we pulled
the CPU off and also we pulled the
heatsink off and we can see here that
this is a big problem because this
doesn't have all the thermal paste on it
which means that either one of these
surfaces isn't flat or the motherboard
might actually need a shim it's like
shim off already--as I don't want to
make another shim although it worked
really well on the graphics card so
we're gonna take a look now and see if
we have to make a CPU ship
so yeah it looks like it's the coolest
so we're going to try and sand this
thing down and then give it another
round
all right so that's looking a lot better
than last time I'll be happy with that
let's get on with the boss update so
after a BIOS update we are now ready
finally to start completing this build
you
so now we're ready to start testing the
loop out and start filling it up so what
I'm going to use for this part is a
different power supply and I'm actually
going to use a little pin here to short
out the positive and negative on the
24-pin connector what this is going to
do is every time I turn on the power
supply here it's going to turn it on and
give power out to the molex connector
and now for this part I'm going to be
using my molex suits to pin converter
here or connector so that is just going
to essentially turn it into a molex
which I can then plug into the power
supply directly and every time I boot
this up I'm then going to have just my
loop only turning on which is exactly
what I want and you know that's that's
one way of doing it there are other ways
of doing it if you can obviously use
your computer if you want but I wouldn't
recommend that because if you have leaks
then you may fry something so let's get
this going and give it a try
so then we have the results say
everything with the CPU the temperatures
were just simply terrible we had 90
degrees on the standard configuration
then even when I put a shim in there
went up to 95 degrees the GPU however
did start to show a little bit of
promise when I overclocked it the
temperatures really didn't change and
then I did put those two cooler master
fans on in place of the fans that I had
running in but ever before and that
definitely kept the heat down on the
radiator so if there's anything to come
out of a cheap water looping a budget
setup that is don't skimp on the block's
and the pump they're the two most
crucial things that you can't get away
with on skimping on I thought that the
radiator and the hosing and the
reservoir did a pretty good job and all
those connections were very strong I
didn't get any leaks but when it came to
the pump and the blocks they were just
simply not good enough and they were
very far from being even remotely good
for a 24/7 setup and when you compare
that to an air cooling setup I would
rather take the air cooling setup any
day of the week even in price
performance compared to this loop
not to mention all-in-ones will
absolutely kick the pants of today's
loop in that if you've got to 120 ml rad
setups and put them on your and just zip
time on your CPU and your GPU you would
still have much better temperatures and
results than I got here today now how
about the how to and where's the
tutorial on setting up a budget water
cooling loop guide well I'm not ready to
do that yet I need to do more Rd when it
comes to water cooling setups as you see
here today I simply got B and I'm not
used to getting beat when it comes to
doing budget setups for you guys and so
this thing's got me a little bit down in
that I want to get the cheapest water
cooling setup possible but at the same
time it still has to get the results as
we saw they're an all in one or a decent
air cooling setup will get you much
better results than the results that I
got here today
however with water cooling there is just
simply a flaw that you have to spend a
bit of money to get to and I mean if
you're coming in here thinking I'll get
a $5 block and that'll be and I'll be
home and hosed then you've got to think
again because as you saw with my results
I mean this this blocks would just
simply fail besides the quality control
they just didn't
cool that well at all and then there was
the pump as well a cheap pump just
simply couldn't stand anywhere up to a
more expensive pump and I mean that's to
be expected
I was just hoping that the results would
not be worse than say an air cooling
setup anyway guys I hope you enjoyed
this video if you have any questions or
comments about the cheap $50.00 water
cooling loop guide then let me know in
the comment section below but is it
possible for $50.00 a CPU GPU water loop
the answer is no in my opinion though if
you can get the parts too cheap
especially when it comes to use parts
then maybe it is possible so stay tuned
for a proper how-to guide and I will be
getting that done in the near future and
peace out for now bye now it's now
finally time for the moment of truth
will it boot
yeah we'll turn the power switch on this
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
