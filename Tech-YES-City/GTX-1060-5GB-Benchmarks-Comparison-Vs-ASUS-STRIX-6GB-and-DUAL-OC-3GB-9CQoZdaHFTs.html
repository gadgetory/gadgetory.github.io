gravis cards though one of these cards
is a five gigabyte variant which does
differ in ways to the six Gilbert and
three gigabyte variant in not only the
size of the vram but also the bit boss
which has gone from 92 bit to a hundred
and sixty on the five gig model however
will this make a difference in games
let's find out here today but before we
do big thanks to a Zeus and NVIDIA for
sponsoring out today's video while I was
doing today's benchmarks also managed to
trial out the new game filter settings
which are phenomenal and we'll talk
about that later as well without a side
though let's get on into the meat and
potatoes of this video
welcome back to tech yesenin as always
when you guys come here to see a
comparison you always want the numbers
so let's roll those benchmarks
so as we saw in those results the 1065
gigabyte model actually falls behind the
1063 gigabyte model which was a little
bit surprising since it does have twelve
hundred and eighty cuda cores the same
as the six gigabyte variant however that
192 bit bus going down to 160 on the
five gig model does affect performance
in not only games but also synthetic
benchmarks however these two models here
the Zeus dual OC and also the Strix are
shining examples of how a 1060 should
perform the dual OSI model managed to
overclock really well and as we saw in
those noise tests the DB levels are
really low and then we move up to the
Strix 1066 gigabyte with the three fans
that goes to some of the lowest noise
I've ever heard out of a graphics card
in my life
know that you do get the RGB control and
a Zeus with their 1060 Strix Edition
implement what they call Auto extreme
technology essentially it's a fully
automated production method which
delivers the best manufacturing quality
possible also with the Strix 3 fan
Edition here you've got two four pin PWM
control fan headers which enable you to
plug up any normal fan like a Corsair ll
fan for example and run that from the
graphics card so instead of monitoring
your CPU especially if you're playing at
4k for example where the GPU will then
be putting out more heat than the CPU
you can then use the GPU to monitor
those fans you also get the ability to
link up the RGB on this Graham's guard
with a Zeus's or a sync software which
does work really well too however back
to the dual OSI model here it comes in a
white variant in a Zeus implement what
they call their wing blade fan designs
which alpha up to three times quieter
noises compared to the standard five
gigabyte variant which just uses a
generic cooler from a Zeus it was indeed
quieter and it was indeed pushing out
better over clocks so their claims do
seem legit also on the back you get two
HDMI ports with all three of these
models which if you're into VR and
immersing yourself you have that option
of using an extra HDMI port now the dual
OC before we move on to some other
factors it does have its two fan design
which
zoos call the winged blade fans and as
we saw that was performing at a lower
noise level than the five gig variant
here which is just a standard addition
from a Zeus but even then the three
models here did perform better than the
as rock rx 580 which is a decent
implementation for an AMD graphics card
there now it's time to move a little bit
into the Nvidia software and what's
change with the GeForce experience so
you still have that ansell
implementation if the game does support
that feature then you can capture some
really creative shots for instance in
Mass Effect Andromeda you can stop the
game and then get a full 360 sketch
drawing if you so wish use that as
artwork but when we move into the new
feature which I really do like that is
game filter you can set up to three
different profiles and within that you
can change things like your color your
saturation and even really cool modes
like artistic blurs Baca and even change
a sketch mode which makes the game
intake case of dota 2 look like
Borderlands so I really like what Nvidia
is doing with the Freestyle filter you
can set up a custom hotkey to bring down
to the display then you can change these
settings even in-game to make the game
just look so much different and dare I
say a much better implementation than
things like gimmicky HDR which goes on
monitors and doesn't make a difference
because when I pulled the saturation up
in the contrast up the picture did look
a lot better
I'm 144 Hertz ViewSonic 1440p monitor of
course you do have to use the GeForce
experience software if you want to
unlock freestyle filter but on top of
that you can optimize your games with
one click of a button or you can revert
them if you don't like what the
optimization has done as well as quickly
update your drivers within that software
itself so I'm really loving what Nvidia
is doing with the software and I like
what a Zeus is doing with their six
goodbye and three gigabyte variants here
on the table which one of these I'll be
giving away to you guys in the audience
so if you want a chance to enter link is
in the description below completely free
international giveaway and the other
1060 I'll be giving away to one of the
kids in the 5 pcs giveaway to children
here on the Gold Coast
however as opposed to the 5 gigabyte
variant a subscriber actually sent this
in so I do have to return this big thank
you for sending that out and in
conclusion prices 1066 view goodbye to
you can get this for 330 US dollars
currently or if you're on a strat 464 a
UD so it is a premium price generally
for the Strix 3 fan models but you do
get that really quiet noise you do get
the good overclock ability and of course
the RGB and the look of this thing and
the features is absolutely phenomenal
then we've got the dual OSI model more
of a budget option that's still packing
very good quality especially if you want
to overclock or if you want to get the
most performance for your dollar
coming in at 250 US dollars or if you're
in Australia 369 a UD anyway with all
that aside I hope you guys enjoyed
today's video if you're into
overclocking or if you're into getting
the best bang for your buck
I'd probably ignore the 5 gig model and
take a look at either the 3 gigabyte
model or the 6 gigabyte model I really
do think the 3 gigabyte model is
underrated it does perform really well
even at 1080p in today's titles with
some of the settings maxed out but when
you go to sell a PC everyone for some
reason always wants a 6 gigabytes video
if you did then be sure to hit that like
button also big thanks to the Zeus any
video if you're sponsoring out this
video and I'll catch you in the next one
very soon peace out for now bye
completely free international giveaway
the other card I'll be putting in one of
the pieces that will be giving away 2 5
pcs here on the gun - five - five - five
pcs I'm giving away a PC to PC giving
away five kids - five pcs again so for
instance in Andromeda Mass Effect and
Mass Effect Andromeda isn't yeah for
instance in Mass Effect Andromeda</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
