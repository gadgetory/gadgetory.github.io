ITX aka H 81 mediocre ITX
welcome back to take a city this is brew
rain is coming back to you guys today
with a quick review of as Rox H 81 Mini
ITX motherboard now let's see I managed
to pick this up for around $75 and at
that price its mediocre I mean there's
good points as bad points I'll mix them
all together in this review as to keep
the flow of the review going but let's
look at the motherboard itself as soon
as we pull it out of the box we see it's
an all-black motherboard also as
rock-throwing a driver CD which is
typical they also throw in two side of
three cables now looking at the
motherboard itself I will say one good
point about this multiple it's straight
away and that is that all the connection
points are located at the edge of the
board which is something I really like
especially on a mini ITX board when I
went to install this in the case
everything was a breeze to install
everything like all the connection
points were located kind of conveniently
maybe a little thing I'd like to see was
maybe the side of three ports at the
edge as well instead of that USB 3 front
out which is does non-existent even in
the soldiering points of there one thing
about this is it's a H 81m motherboard
and it only features two slots of ram
ddr3 RAM which is typical of a H 81 ml
but it's also typical of a mini ITX
motherboard as well so that's not a
problem it also has two fan outs or fan
headers on the middle of the board and
in the CPU which is fine and it only
features one CPU 4 pin connector so I
wouldn't really recommend this for
overclocking a Pentium 32:58 and I'll
talk about this a little bit more in
death I think this mother bought
honestly let's talk about a quick bad
point about this motherboard I do
believe it is only good for like a HT PC
home theater PC or just a little office
PC where you're not installing a taxing
graphics card because when I hooked up a
750 Ti to this thing and I under voltage
the CPU the the heatsink the asrock
heatsink there I mean it's a nice
looking heatsink don't get me wrong it
looks pretty cool it's situated in the
right spot it got really hot to touch
and something for me personally I don't
like using motherboards 24/7 or
something for gaming long gaming
sessions with something that gets really
hot so if you're a gamer I wouldn't
really recommend this motherboard for
you
I'd say invest in extra 2030
and get maybe a z87 from gigabyte or
something with more caps and chokes and
a better mosfet onboard so it's kind of
like they even though they say they make
a feature on the back of the box here
that's got four caps instead of three I
still find it's not enough if you want
to make a nice black horse PC especially
if you're making like a gaming mini ITX
PC however let's go back to the
motherboard itself we got the PCI 216
speed and that is ample fine for running
any graphics card like I put out only
still again I'd only couple like it's GT
610 on this board something that uses
next to no power so that's fine located
in right down the bottom net fits in a
mini ITX board find also the screw
points as for screw points for
connecting this to a mini ITX case
screws in absolutely no problems the
aesthetics of the motherboard also is
pleasing to the eye it's a nice
all-black look on the front and the rear
and now let's move over to the rear of
the motherboard now so looking at the
rear of the motherboard we have here the
realtek ALC eight nine to auto out there
so it's got support for 5.1 channel
analog surround it's also got a mic in
line in and it's also got an optical out
there as well which is pretty cool for
especially for a chatty one a
motherboard looking at the nicr board
we've also got a core column of theorist
so not some cheap real tech and IC which
all you guys hate I know everyone just
bashes on the realtek and IC and it's a
good reason right it is pretty junk the
real tech on on board and ICS looking at
the USB ports we've got four USB to
ports there we've also got two USB 3
ports also got an Eastsider port HDMI a
VGA connection and a DVI connection as
well we've also got a ps2 connection to
those people who like to use a ps2
keyboard so looking at the middle of the
motherboard here and installation we can
see here that installation was a breeze
everything was where it should be it
also has two fan a four pin fan out
there in the middle of the board which
is actually a pretty good place in a
mini ITX rig so now let's move on to the
conclusion with this motherboard okay so
basically it is a nice reasonably sturdy
motherboard it's a mini ITX motherboard
on a budget however when I using it when
using a
practically and using it for what I
wanted it to do it just simply wasn't up
to par I mean fair enough it had what I
needed to solder three ports was enough
for me to two slots of RAM was enough
for me as well however when I hooked up
the 750ti
and under vaulted the Pentium under
vaulted the rounded make his least
stress as possible on the motherboard it
still managed to get pretty damn hot and
so I wouldn't recommend this motherboard
for a gamer for a person using this as a
mini ITX motherboard in a gaming mini
ITX gaming pc i just don't think it
wasn't up to par honestly I'd rather you
guys spend a little bit of extra money
and get above motherboard with better
solid components on there better caps
but it chokes better MOSFET or more of
them and that's that so yet all in all
this motherboard not really for the
enthusiast however I will say that this
motherboard when I hooked it up as a
home theater PC it ran really cool it
ran as it should doesn't have a hiccup
everything was pretty good nothing cut
out nothing was wrong with this PC every
all the connection points felt pretty
sturdy and yeah it just ran without a
breeze the BIOS was actually really good
as well the UEFI BIOS was actually
really easy to use so kudos to asrock
for that and that being said for $75 or
whatever I mean whatever you can get
this thing maybe it's cheaper in the
States for $75 it does get a
recommendation only if you're using it
for a home theater PC or only if you're
using it basically with a pentium or
really low powered GPU something like a
GT 610 anything high anything more
enthusiasm a stand that I do not
recommend this motherboard anyway guys
that's it for the H 81 and Mini ITX from
asrock if you liked this review please
give it a thumbs up if you have any
questions about this motherboard please
leave a comment in the comments section
below and that's that I'm going to be
getting the crucial MX 100 250 CC bite
review done for you guys next so stay
tuned for that and if you haven't
already hit the sub button become a yes
band today anyway I'm gonna roll the
outro piece out for now bye
