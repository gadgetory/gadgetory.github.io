coming back to you guys today with a
Denmark Denmark Denmark Denmark build
for october2013 everyone's been
screaming out for Denmark from Europe so
I'm come to Denmark this month next
month i might go to Norway and then the
month after that I might go to I don't
know request some place and i'll go
there anyway i'm using a site called
happy DK because I'm happy and this site
looks like it's happy yeah let's get on
with the build you know I didn't even
know what's going on here just I found
the lowest numbers for prices and looked
at some good parts put it in the car for
you guys so I hope you guys enjoy this
here's the first part of the build
corsair vengeance ddr3 a key but cl9
memory it's a blue kit looks pretty good
for the money if you can find ram
cheaper than by all means do so but this
stuff will be good it will clock really
well i mean just banging the XMP
profiles and you will have a damn good
memory kit for your cpu and your whole
system anyway Haswell love this stuff
basically msi g45 gaming you know if you
if you want to go with another z87
motherboard then by all means do so i
just love this motherboard i think it's
one I think the best value-for-money z87
motherboard out there overclocks
extremely well has an amazing on-board
audio solution and I can test them into
that I've tested it out thoroughly
tested the NAC out thoroughly that works
really well as well and not to mention
it looks good the boot I mean the thing
looks awesome so you've got sort of
three ports there six of those you've
also got and pretty good heat sinks on
board as well this board runs really
cool as well i'll be i'll tell you that
now it's also got the clear CMOS on the
back so if you run into a bad overclock
hit that button no problems no questions
asked this is why i like this board it's
good it's damn good now let's go on to
the next bother build bic phoenix
bitfenix merc beta black now this is a
case that looks really good for the
money top power top panel power button
reset button for USB ports which is
pretty damn awesome audio out microphone
in it's got an actually got an awesome
logo this is one of the few logos that
really looks good on a case I like that
front smashed side panels meshed add
some fans in if you wish to inside
there's not a photo up here but inside
you've got the extra room for those big
graphics card
you know you can use this thing of the
future as well it'll look after you
looks like a good case nice and clean
nice and sleek I like it let's go to the
next part of the build for you guys XFX
graphics otherwise graphics I mean it's
a power supply anyway so it's a XFX
power supply 550 watt 80 plus bronze
this thing has a lot of PCI Express outs
so it'll it'll power up any graphics
card you throw at it generally I mean if
you're going with the Titan honestly I'd
go with like a 650 watt that's just me
just to be on the safe side because you
know I want to overclock that the graphs
got and the CPU I want to overclock
things till their balls just fall off
and I mean yeah this build though for
the gtx 770 this thing is going to be
absolutely fine you know it'll power GDS
m6 Sims only no problems next part of
the build is the samsung 840 series
120gb SSD so this is the SSD here on
this site is running in Denmark what's
wrong with your internet anyway i'm
waiting for the like i'm waiting for
this this thing to load come on oh man i
had this problem actually i was looking
up these items for the cart in my lunch
break of work and I had the exact same
problem with this website it just takes
ages to load so I don't know what's the
internet like in Denmark is it good or
is it bad can you guys let me know you
know internet in Japan is freaking
phenomenal anyway this is a samsung SSD
can you just wait two seconds like
literally just wait two minutes oh my
wife's just she wants to have some
dinner we're going to get soon a little
baby just hang on two minutes I gotta
get this bill done anyway samsung SSD
773 corona good value for money it'll go
in your budget build it'll power up
everything you know it make your machine
really good really snappy really fast
next part of the build is the Sith
Kabuto to now I couldn't find a cpu
cooler anywhere like literally couldn't
find one anywhere in Denmark this is the
only one I could find that was in stock
and to be honest it's at a good price as
well 144 current I think that comes in
at 20 USD really good cpu cooler for the
money it's going to power this Haswell
machine absolutely fine socket 11
55 as well good value for money now
let's go on to the next part of build
this is the light on 22 speed DVD burner
if you already have one of these things
then you don't need one but you're
probably going to need one for a nice
install so if you don't have one then
buy yourself one for 165 corona now next
by the build one of the most important
parts of the build is the graphics card
gtx 770 overclocked this thing is just
one hell of a beastie graphics card the
wind force cooler is really good as well
it works well personally I'm not a
gigabyte person myself have had some bad
experiences with them but I'm not going
to let that bias my decision it is good
value for money you know I 2800 krone I
don't even know how much that is in USD
but it was the cheapest gtx 770
overclocked addition i could find not to
mention it's pretty good now so this
thing will just annihilate any game you
throw at it it'll be good on 1600 p as
well if you wish to make a 1600 p build
this thing will support that pretty damn
well 1080p 120 hertz it'll dominate most
games battlefield 4 though looks pretty
damn intensive so i came to see how that
runs apparently though the verdict is
like the difference between ultra and
lows not even that big anyway so yeah I
mean this thing will power up like
medium probably 120 Hertz fine my next
part of the build is the course it's not
the Corsair the intel core i5 4670k now
this is the currently the highest IPC on
the market I've been saying this in
every budget build amazing CPU you know
you know people like haswell's bad but
from my experience with as well it was
better than ivy bridge for me I mean it
just depends it's the luck of the draw
thing you know you by the CPU you might
get one that clocks like a dog it might
only go to 4.2 gigs but you know my one
will go up to 4.8 I'm going to test for
five soon so if you get lucky you know
test it out if it's boots at 4.8 then
you may wish to think about d letting it
and put that Seth Kabuto to its knees
but this thing is definitely a good cpu
for cause it'll just really romp the
game's romper stomper shaved head that's
what it'll do so awesome cpu there for
the money last part of the build is a
western digital caviar black now
I couldn't even find the caviar blue on
this website but the caviar black came
up it was in stock 654 krona comes with
an amazing warranty these things come
with a five year warranty and they just
work so they're 604 cronin doesn't seem
like a bad deal i guess i'm not sure
isn't like the conversion rate 18 krona
one u.s. dollar or something so yeah
that brings the whole total to 8800
krona so you know if you guys have a bit
of you know if you want to save money
then definitely do an FX 6300 970
chipset motherboard and take the SSD out
and maybe go for a gtx 760 that's if you
want to save money if you want to go
extra on if you want to give you got
more if you've got krona out the ass if
you've just got krona everywhere like
Brian I'm a boy I want something bigger
gtx 780 in there 240gb SSD and a 650
watt power supply that'll look after you
anyway guys I hope you guys in Denmark
enjoyed this budget build if you have
any questions please send me a message
or please leave a comment and I'll get
back to you as soon as like as soon as I
can if you ladies bill please give it a
thumbs up and I will catch you guys very
soon with some other videos now so i'll
finish the month for the budget builds
i'll be coming with normal tech bids now
