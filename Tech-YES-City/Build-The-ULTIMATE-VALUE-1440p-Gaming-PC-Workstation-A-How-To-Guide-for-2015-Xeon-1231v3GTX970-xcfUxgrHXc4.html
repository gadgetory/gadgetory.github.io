ultimate 1440p gaming PC for 2015 just
see the star
component selection is easily the most
important part of building a new gaming
PC I don't know how many times I've seen
people put in really high engrams cards
with bad CPUs or vice versa and the end
result is something that won't perform
as well as something that would have
otherwise costed a lot less money so
today we're going with the build that
although is a little bit expensive and
face value and the initial cost will be
a little bit expensive everything here
just synergizes really well to make a
great gaming PC as well as double down
as a great workstation PC so I'll
quickly go through the component
selection and why I'm picking what I'm
picking in today's build and then we'll
get onto the installation so first up
here we have the motherboard this is the
b85 pro-gamer from a Zeus now if you
can't get this motherboard in your
country there is an alternative that I
will recommend and that is the asrock
fatality killer b85 as well both should
be had for around about the same price
and they should offer similar features
as one another however let's get back to
this motherboard and the four things
that I really like about it the first
thing vrm 8 + 2 phase power design with
great components in that vrm as well
this will mean a solid power delivery
for your CPU and other components as
well as great power savings as well and
it will help keep the motherboard cool
as well second thing I like about this
motherboard it has the supreme FX audio
chipset on board now the audio out on
this motherboard is phenomenal
especially for a board that comes under
$100 the mic in and the line in are okay
but the audio out is phenomenal which is
what counts especially for a gamer now
the third thing I like about this board
is it uses the Intel I - 1 7 v ni C
which is great for games great for
transferring files across networks as
well and then there's a fourth thing all
this comes under $100 win so for the CPU
we're going with an interesting choice
and that is the xeon 1231 v3 this is
actually the Haswell refresh edition of
the xeon cpus for the LGA 1155 socket
and this comes clocked in at three point
four gigs base though it has a
a clock that enables it to go up to
three point eight gigs and now with that
previous motherboard that I mentioned
the b85 pro-gamer you can get this thing
to three point eight gigs on all cause
if you use the right bias revision so
essentially we've got a CPU that can go
up to three point eight gigs on a b85
chipset and it comes in at around about
250 dollars now another great thing
about this CPU is that it's got hyper
threading as well so when we're doing
those workstation applications we can
take advantage of that hyper threading
especially when we're rendering a video
for example we can make rendering times
a lot faster by utilizing hyper
threading as opposed to just a fork or
without hyper threading now another
benefit of this CPU is that it uses a
better fan than the normal desktop by
seven and high five editions of the
intel coolers so it has the same cooler
though it uses a better fan so this fan
is going to be a little bit more quiet
and it's going to be a little bit more
powerful than the cheaper variants that
they use on the desktop series of their
chips now for the grams card another
crucial point for a gaming PC and today
we're going with the GTX 970 from Nvidia
any-any GTX 970 will be really good for
gaming at 1440p this is the g1 gaming
Edition from gigabyte and it is an
absolute beast at 1440p I haven't had
any problems on any games that I've
played with this thing now there's
recently been a fiasco where effectively
this card really only uses 3.5 gigabytes
of its be ran and as much as I don't
agree with the way Nvidia marketed it it
still is a great card for the money so
any variant of this graphics card will
be great for gaming at 1440p so next up
we got the power splay this is the
Animax revolution xt 630 watt gold rated
power supply now this is overkill for
this build however it was the cheapest
of power supply that I could get with
the features that I wanted I wanted
black sleeve cabling to make the build
look sleek I also wanted a gold rated
power supply to bring down efficiency I
also want a decent parameters in there
like low ripple suppression and solid
voltage regulation
and this past play certainly delivers in
that regards now there are many other
vendors out there ones that come to -
see sonic super flower Corsair I'm sure
they're an tech there's a lot of other
great power supply makers out there
however I do recommend going with at
least 500 watts for this build I know if
you get a solid 450 watt power supply
that will be fine as well something like
a rose will capstone as well that'll be
fine for the job today however I'm going
with a 631 gold rated power supply and
it does absolutely fine for the build
today so for storage today we're going
with the 256 gigabyte MX 100 from
crucial there are newer variants of this
out there's the more faster MX 200 which
will give you even better speeds than
this - just keep in mind though when you
buy an SSD from crucial it's pretty much
going to be guaranteed great value for
money again great value for money
Western Digital blue one terabyte this
thing is solid it's fast you'll be able
to put all those games that you don't
really play on this Drive as well as
using it for a temporary Drive to
capture gameplay with things like shadow
play or capture temporary recordings on
your desktop so great Drive
so for memory we're going with some ddr3
memory from any reputable manufacturer
and the reason why it's not such a big
deal is because the b85 has a speed
limit on the memory of 1600 megahertz
and so you can't get any higher than
this so buying super fancy Ram will not
give you any benefits on this Oh
in today's bill so for peripherals we're
going with a little bit of a mix this is
my recommendation and this is what I use
personally headphones we've got the
Fidelio L ones I absolutely love these
things especially if you go on the
internet you can get a cheap
female-to-female adapter and then you
can get a V mode of boom Pro and you've
got yourself one awesome gaming headset
with amazing sound quality for around
about a hundred and fifty dollars the
next up we've got the mouse this is the
G 302 from Logitech this thing is great
that's all I can say
great sensor great response times great
build quality except the price isn't so
great it's $50 so it is a little bit
expensive but I'm telling you it's my
new favorite Mouse and I absolutely love
this mouse so next up for the keyboard
we've got a cherry MX mechanical
keyboard I love to use a cherry MX blue
personally even though this is a cherry
MX red so go try the keyboards I've got
a mechanical keyboards buyer's guide
that you guys can check out choose the
right keyboard for you
though keep in mind that this is an
expensive keyboard though it is a luxury
that I do recommend to people if there
is serious about PC gaming or they're
serious about doing work in front of
their computer and not getting wrist
strain for example especially with the
Cherry MX blue cases today we're going
with the I vector from Animax this is a
great case for the money it's got a
clear acrylic side window it's also got
a switch on there which you can mod and
which I did mod to put in LED lights and
switch it to low low noise low settings
or even switch the fans off completely
great case great room to work with and
very easy and makes a lot a lot of
things make sense in this case though
you don't have to go up this case you
can go with something like a like I've
got sitting around here at a fractal
define are four very solid case could
probably survive a nuclear holocaust so
the parts list wouldn't be complete
without a monitor so in the background
here I have a Yamaka C from eBay that
which costs about $300 delivered to your
door and these are 1440p IPS displays
they're absolutely gorgeous
you've got a lot of real estate there on
your screen so if you don't want to get
something shipped from Korea and you
want to get something domestically then
I'd say hold out for a little bit
because later this month
aisa have a 1440p 144 Hertz both TN and
IPS panels hitting the market they will
be a bit more expensive than this though
there will be great especially for
gaming
so now it's time to build this bad boy
and before we do we can just quickly go
ground ourselves by touching a grounding
point or just go touch a car outside
that will generally do the trick you
don't have to go waste money on an
anti-static builder's wristband or some
overpriced and ecstatic builder's mat I
mean I've built countless computers on
the carpet for what it's worth so anyway
let's move on to this bill we'll go
through a quick run-through of what I
did so I generally like to install the
CPU or the memory first it doesn't make
a big difference unless you have a big
air cooler and if you have a big air
cool then you'll generally want to
install the memory first just to make
sure that it clears the memory
especially if it's got a high profile
heat sinks as well as being a lot easier
to install it first up especially if you
can't get in there later once the cooler
covers the RAM slots but in this case
we've got an intel heat sink fan that
doesn't even go near the RAM slots so I
decided to install that first after I've
done this I put some heatsink paste on
the dive either the spread method or the
pea method is absolutely fine though I
will say that I do take a slight
preference to the spread method
especially in high performance
applications though after that would
just be very careful here and we install
the RAM and just firmly press on the
edges of the RAM to get that in and just
take your time with this like seriously
just you don't have to force anything in
just firmly press everything in and if
you can't press it in then just have a
break or ask someone else to try it for
you though I do have a full uncut how to
build your first PC guide and I'll put a
link in the description below for that
though there are some other great guides
out there from other youtubers so be
sure to check that out especially if
it's your first time building a PC if
it's not your first time building a PC
or if it's second or third or whatever
then it's most likely going to be a walk
in the park so after we've done that we
can then start to screw the motherboard
into the case and I do generally prefer
a magnetic tip screwdriver and out of my
whole PC building experience this is one
thing that I will strongly recommend is
a magnetic tip screwdriver if you have a
normal screwdriver and you drop screws
man it can take some time it
waste time so I highly recommend getting
a magnetic tip screwdriver if you are
installing PC components especially I
mean yeah screwing things down anyway
let's get back to the build here so
after you've screwed down your
motherboard and everything's all good
you can then install your graphics card
in the PCI Express slot that's if you're
using a dedicated graphics card and then
after that you can install the solder
drives in the solder drive bays to the
side there as well as the DVD drive if
you are going to install a DVD drive
after that you can then install your
power supply and get all your cables
ready and start to route things up
though I generally like to install my
solder cables first before the power
supply cables and I like to install the
front input output connectors as well
before I do power supply cables as the
power supply cables are the absolute
last thing that I do as well as cable
management because with cable management
I generally like to zip-tie everything
off and after that I don't want to come
back to it ever again so as you can see
here this is actually a non modular
power supply that we used here it's a
650 watt and there was a lot of spare
cables the fact that it fitted in this
case was actually a testament to the
Animax I vector and how much room they
do give you here at the back for cable
management so here you can see here this
is the final step in the build once
you've got everything ready you've got
all your drive bays installed you can
then start routing your cables and
generally making everything clean making
sure any all the air flow will not be
obstructed so after cable management we
can then start to put the side panels
back on and get everything ready for our
first boot that's all those juicy
peripheral
so once we've done that we can connect
all the devices that we need to connect
and get it ready for its first boot and
as you can see here it's booting up
perfectly fine we can then go into the
BIOS and get things ready for our first
boot
so now it's in time to install the OS
and I want you guys to get a program
called ume that's if you're going to
make a USB bootable pendrive and I'll
put the link in the description below
for it but once we've done this we can
get our ISO ready on the desktop right
next to you me open up you me and then
put our pendrive into the computer and
then you me will recognize it and I do
recommend formatting it to a fat32
partition if you can it will make life a
lot easier but once we've got all that
ready we can then select the ISO which
is right on the desktop here and then we
can click Next and with just a few
clicks you me will get a a USB bootable
pendrive ready so this program saves a
lot of time it's a great program for
making USB bootable pendrive so let's
get on to the next step and that's to
insert your pet USB pendrive into the
fresh computer and then press the power
button and then repeatedly press f8
until you get that boot menu up and once
you get that boot menu up you can then
select the USB pendrive from the
drop-down options so as we can see here
it's appeared here that would be my io
data USB pendrive
and then you'll see the u me come up
here the u me multi boot USB UI you can
then select your instable ISO there from
the windows 7 8 option and then you can
click install windows 8 as we can see
here it's recommend it's recognized it
and we're good to go so after this step
after you've installed Windows 8 on your
desktop you can then start to tune your
OS and get it ready to your liking and
at this stage I do recommend especially
if it's your first computer running your
components in for a good week just to
make sure none of the default settings
are causing any problems or you don't
have any hardware malfunctions so after
our hardware's all good and everything's
good and we've customized our OS we can
then move on to the next stage and that
is overclocking and finding all the
settings right for you now if you're
building this exact computer feel free
to copy my settings and I will put them
in the description below
all the settings that I've used today in
this video and I will be making a
under-voltage guide as well for the Zeon
so stay tuned for that
though once everything is fully tuned we
can then move on to the next stage and
that is the benchmarks
so here we are at the finished product
and this is what I decided to call it tu
a or the underappreciated as I believe
it is just that it's underappreciated in
today's market where everyone's off
focusing on fancy fish cool tank PCs or
they're off focusing on fancy water
cooling pcs and I believe something like
this is just simple doesn't cost a lot
to build and is elegant doesn't get
enough appreciation hence the name so
something about this PC and something in
regards to this case directly is that
you can turn the LED lights and the fans
off or you can just turn the fans on in
silent mode with the LEDs off so I'll be
doing a follow-up video showing you or
telling you guys exactly what I did in
terms of modding this case past just
putting the parts in normally and also
I'll be answering more questions for you
guys in the comments in a follow-up
video so if you have any questions about
this rig or about the whole setup then
put a comment in the comment section
below and I'll be following up for you
guys so let's move on now to some
benchmarks where we can see how well
this thing performs in games also
productivity tasks and some synthetic
benchmarks as well
so all those figures you saw in the
benchmarks this was attained with power
consumption that was just a little bit
over 300 watts absolutely fantastic
efficiency there so this will mean that
you'll be saving money on the power bill
especially when you compare it to more
power-hungry rigs so how do we get these
power consumption figures on these low
consumption figures we're using the b85
chipset that's another advantage of
using that motherboard we've also got
the Xeon under voltage to 0.99 volts
also got the ddr3 under voltage so we've
tweaked the settings and then we're
using the GTX 970 which is one of the
most efficient GPUs for the Watts out
there so this just makes not only a
great value for money build in terms of
the end results it also makes a great
build in terms of efficiency so if you
guys like this build I put links in the
description below for the US the UK and
Australia as well so feel free to mix
and match the components that you like
and get the best build for you they keep
in mind this thing will do a great job
on saving power on the power bill it'll
do a great job of giving you high end
high gameplay footage at 1440p it also
do a great job at workstation tasks if
you're into editing videos or if you're
into doing special effects or things
like that so no I guess I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did please
give it a thumbs up and if you haven't
already subscribe to take your city
where I'll be coming back to you guys
today with some more tech videos video
took me a long time to do and I was kind
of just battling with some real tough
illnesses over the last like month so
anyway I'm back in the game make sure if
you ask those questions if you have them
because I'll be talking about this build
a little bit more in depth and in
another follow-up video so guys I'll
catch you in another video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
