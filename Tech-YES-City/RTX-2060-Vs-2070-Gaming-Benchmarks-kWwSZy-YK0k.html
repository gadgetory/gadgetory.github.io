here, two graphics cards,
the R-T-X 2060 versus the R-T-X 2070.
Now, this is a brand new car.
It's actually not as
new as that gaming P-C
in the background there,
which we just did a video on.
I'll quickly remedy that.
(wrappers crumpling)
(upbeat music)
So, now, back to the topic at hand.
Two graphics cards here, that
represent, in my opinion,
the better value of the R-T-X lineup.
We have the 2060 and the 2070, now.
In some comparisons I've seen,
these cars come in close.
In the testing that I've done,
they have had a bit of a gap.
So, I've decided to test
them out heed to head,
where I'm gonna be both,
overclocking these samples
as well as comparing them
at their stock settings
in a variety of different titles.
So, what are we waiting for?
Let's just roll the benchmarks
and talk about these graphics cards.
(upbeat music)
So, now, after testing
both these graphics cards,
overclocked and non-overclocked,
they both came in around the same levels
when it came to overclocking.
As we can see here with the core clocks
and also the memory overclocks,
they came to very similar levels.
Which makes this comparison even better
when you guys wanna think about purchasing
either of these cards,
and which you should go for.
And before we go on with this
and looking at the numbers in-depth,
I will say that both the cards
in different countries
cost different amounts.
So, I'm gonna focus on this main point.
In the U-S, on amazon.com,
you can currently get the R-T-X 2060
for around 350 U-S delivered.
And then, looking at the R-T-X 2070,
you currently get that for around 500 U-S.
So, there's a difference of a $150.
And that's actually quite
a sizable difference,
especially if you're on a budget
and you're looking to save some money.
But if you're in Australia,
the difference as of now
is a 151 Aussie dollars
if you go on E-Bay,
'cause they got the
sales on at the moment.
Basically, if you're in
Australia versus the U-S,
it's actually cheaper
to get an R-T-X 2070.
And if you're in America,
the difference is bigger than
it would be in Australia,
if that makes any sense.
And we'll talk about that later,
for which I'm going to recommend.
But let's look at the numbers here, first.
As we can see, with Anthem,
here, the R-T-X 2070,
even when it's not overclocked
versus an overclocked R-T-X 2060.
Who's comfortably ahead
by roughly 20% in this particular title?
When we overclock it a little bit more,
it didn't really help it a whole lot.
Just like it didn't really
help the R-T-X 2060.
And then, (mumbles) Apex
Legends saw this trend continue.
However, there was some
variance in this benchmark.
It is a multi-player title
and I do like to test it out,
the multi-player settings
versus single-player.
Because it just really introduces
a real-world scenario playing this game.
And I find, that is a big gap
in-between the F-P-S numbers.
So, 1080 P, on both cards
was absolutely fine.
But I did decide to throw in a test
for you guys at 1440 P, max settings.
Because it does recommend
you have eight gigabytes
of VRAM on this particular game
with these particular settings.
And this is where the R-T-X
2070 did fair a lot better,
especially when we look
at those 0.1% lows.
The R-T-X 2060 did see a
slight amount of stuttering
which was noticeable to my eyes.
So, basically, if you're looking to get
a card for 1440 P, Ultra settings,
and you know that's what you wanna get.
The 2070s extra two gigabytes of VRAM
may be an important factor
in your purchasing decision.
But we also decided
to test out Shadows of the Tomb Raider
on higher settings at 1440 P.
And it didn't really see any problems
on the R-T-X 2060s six gigabytes of VRAM.
So, basically, what does this mean,
(mumbles) into the benchmarks, here.
Means that the 2060 has six
gigabytes of VRAM right now.
And most titles are
gonna be absolutely fine.
But some titles at 1440
P Ultra, for example,
may incur that limit,
which then will effect
your gaming experience.
But on the flip side,
looking at Shadows of the Tomb Raider,
1080 P settings, for example,
showed a little difference.
Especially between the
R-T-X 2060 overclocked
versus the R-T-X 2070 not overclocked.
And I think,
we started to hit a bit
of a C-P-U ceiling, here.
And I was using the 9900 K, here.
At five gigahertz, overclocked.
So, if this C-P-Us incurring
a little bit of a limitation, here.
Then, other C-P-Us that
aren't as expensive
will definitely incur
more of a limitation.
So, if you're a 1080 P gamer,
looks like, the R-T-X 2060
may be a better choice,
based on these numbers.
But then, moving over to Metro Exodus,
1080 P, Ultra settings here,
showed that we had 53 F-P-S and 60 F-P-S,
one is overclocked.
But then, the 2070 just simply outclasses
G-B-U by quite a lot.
Getting 80 and then 86 average F-P-S
when it was overclocked.
So, it's literally in a different league
when we're looking at these numbers.
But moving back to Far Cry five,
we saw numbers that sort
of followed the trend here,
of roughly at 20% gain,
when we compare the 2070 to the 2060.
And then, some synthetics for you guys.
Fire Strike sort of followed this trend
as well as Time Spy Extreme.
Now, another thing to point
out for you guys, too,
is that the 2070 will use up a
bit more power than the 2060.
So, that may be another factor
when it comes to looking
for a power supply
and also a cheaper case,
if you can't get enough
airflow through that case.
And you wanna keep
things on a strict budget
but you still want that performance.
In that case, you may wish to
also check out the 1660 T-I,
which I'll put a link for, up here.
Which had some excellent
power consumption numbers.
But now, taking a closer look
at these two cards in particular,
for this comparison.
The Galax R-T-X 2060 has a 650 gram cooler
that measures at about 23
and a 1/2 centimeters long.
And we're testing in 25 degree ambience
in today's comparison.
And what we saw was,
this cooler did a great
job out of the box.
With its auto fan-speeds,
they went to about 57%.
We got noise levels of about 45 decibels.
And the temperatures hit about 71 degrees,
which is absolutely fine.
It's not the best I've seen here,
but it's definitely far from the worst.
But moving through, 60%, 80% and 100%,
saw the noise levels increase
as well as the temperatures decrease.
I think, a 100% is kind of unbearable.
And pretty much on every graphics card
that comes here with a 100%,
is pretty much unbearable.
But 80% might be worth a look,
if you've got a good
case with sound dampening
and you don't mind a little bit of noise
creeping out of that case.
However, onto Nvidia's
Founder's Edition, R-T-X 2070.
This thing is just
phenomenal, in my opinion.
The cooling solution they've implemented
is really high-quality.
This card weighs-in at roughly 977 grams,
measures 23 centimeters long
and the fan-speed's at 54%.
That's the auto fan-speeds,
scored 40 decibels.
The temperatures went up to 76 degrees.
And then, at 60% fan-speeds,
I think, this is the sweet-spot.
You got 42 decibels but
also 73 degrees max temps.
80% scored 51 decibels, 66 degrees.
And then, a 100% which
is pretty unbearable.
57 decibels and 62 degrees C.
So, in a nutshell,
both Galax and Nvidia
have done a great job
of implementing good cooling solutions
on the graphics cards used
in today's comparison.
If you go with the Nvidia card,
you're gonna get a D-V-I-R,
as well as two DisplayPort
1.4s, H-D-M-I 2.0 out,
as well as a U-S-B Type C,
display out as well.
If you go with the Galax solution,
you get one D-V-I,
one H-D-M-I 2.0 out and
one display 1.4 out.
In terms of power connectors,
they both require eight
pin P-C-I-E connectors.
And the Nvidia has the input
on the rear of the card, versus the Galax,
which has it on the side of the card.
The Galax also features R-G-B line,
which control in the software.
And they've also introduced
their One Click O-C,
which does a decent job,
if you just want a little
boost in performance.
Not as good as the custom overclock.
And then, moving onto the Nvidia card,
that has the logo which
lights-up green on the side.
Which you can turn off with
the visualizer software.
But now that we're through
all those intricate details
with these two graphics cards,
which should you get?
I'd say, if you're a new
viewer to the channel here,
you've probably come here
with a recommendation of,
okay, Brian, which should I get,
the R-T-X 2060 or the R-T-X 2070?
And honestly, these are
my two favorite cards
out of Nvidia's new lineup.
They're not the best value ever,
but they're decent value
at face-value for both of them.
I'd say, in Australia,
I would definitely go with the 2070.
I think, it's better value.
You get the two gigabytes, extra VRAM,
you get more CUDA Cores.
You also get more Tensor
and also more D-L-S-S
power at its disposal,
since it does have more of that enabled.
But of course,
the games that can really
utilize R-T-X features
and you actually wanna turn
them on, is very little.
I think, the original, Quake II,
being the exception where
it's actually one good game
that you'd wanna go back and play,
with Ray Tracing on.
But now, the R-T-X 2060,
who should buy this card?
It's basically for someone
who wants to play at 1080 P.
They want to get a budget monitor
that's maybe a higher
refresh-rate at 1080 P.
They don't care too much about
playing at high settings
versus ultra settings.
If they want to step it up to 1440 P.
Or they're not too
concerned about the future.
But they also wanna
save a 150 U-S dollars.
So, basically, if you're
in the United States,
I'd take a look at both
these cards and say,
do I want the extra
features of the R-T-X 2070
for a 150 U-S dollars more?
And to top that off, it is
gonna consume more power.
And it is gonna add a bit
more heat inside your case.
So, if you're in the U-S
and you're looking at
pure price performance
based on today's results,
I'd go with the R-T-X 2060.
If you're in Australia
and you're looking at
pure price performance,
but you also want a better card,
I'd go with the R-T-X 2070.
