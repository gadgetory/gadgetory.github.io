corner and we are going to be reporting
on it at sea yes though what should we
expect as tech hungry consumers well
today we discuss the good the bad and
what comes after the long-awaited 7
nanometers
you
welcome back to the yes of tech city
we'll start with what to look forward to
and risin to that 3000 series you'll
hear Silicon manufacturers talking about
the magical efficiency what does this
mean for us enthusiasts well mostly it
means lower operating voltages and all
the traits associated with lower voltage
the most obvious being law of power
consumption which will save you both
power and subsequently energy that
doesn't need to be wasted in heat TSMC
the manufacturing office supplying
qualcomm nvidia and AMD has stated that
they expect seven animated to yield a 40
percent drop in power usage compared to
their own ten nanometer design another
advantage to smaller seven animated
transistors is being able to fit more of
them in a package of the same size all
simply condense the chip this will allow
more space for batteries and mobile
applications or more processing power in
the same size outfit for desktop power
users for example so speed lower voltage
and a smaller footprint what's not to
like about this well on the consumption
side everything is straightforward and
seems good however when it comes to the
manufacturing side there are far more
repercussions involved in the process
itself firstly before the product even
goes to market there is a huge amount of
research and development involved in the
design of the wafer according to Gartner
research group the design of the wafer
itself nothing else associated with a7
enemy2 SOC design costs approximately
271 million dollars and easily enough it
is these same outlays that will
eventually end on the receipt of the
consumer indirectly which is why I'm
somewhat skeptical of the room at $499
u.s. price tag of AMD's upcoming rise in
3000 series flagship I mean 16 cores and
32 threads of all but nothing but
improvements it does seem a little too
good to be true though I think what AMD
is trying to achieve is market their CP
users unbeatable value and covering
their R&amp;amp;D costs with bulk volume of
sales after all they have an average
margin rate of 39
sent and it is growing which is good to
hear though competitors like Intel and
NVIDIA for example have over 60 and 59%
respectively
however the buck doesn't just stop there
with AMD they also have in the works
seven nanometer Navi GPUs so it's
looking like they will be extracting the
absolute maximum value out of that seven
nanometer TSMC node though what about
the competitor Intel well they are
currently on 40 nanometer with their own
in-house fabrication meaning they make
the wafers themselves this has been
quite a brick road for them and does
point out some of the policies involved
in chasing to higher clock speed for
instance their 9900 K and previous 8700
K chips had no problems achieving 5
gigahertz clock speeds however years
before that a 6700 K chip which is based
on the same 14 nanometer node which
struggle to reach 4.6 or even 4.7
gigahertz these improvements in turn can
be thanked for what is known as mature
raishin of the process itself that is it
becomes refined over time however it can
be a dangerous stepping stone if the
said company does not find out ways to
deliver performance increases whether it
be through architectural improvements or
from a shrink in transistor size itself
though as you may have already read
Intel has faced some massive delays in
2018 in that their yields and I use that
plural II that is the chips that meet
the effective quota for being usable in
products and all the effective clock
speeds obtainable have been poor and
essentially caused massive delays moving
forward though this is not the first
time we have seen this from Intel if you
remember the Broadwell 14 nanometer eye
750 775 for example or you may not have
remembered it since it didn't last long
in the shelves at all and quite frankly
it just got silently harsh to market had
very little gains in terms of IPC and
architectural improvements over its
predecessor has well Broadwell had much
lower clock speeds which made it
effectively that is if it were to be
pushed as the next big thing been a
slower product than the i7 4770k for
example this is generally not how tech
companies wanted
business enhance after that Intel began
on skylake which at the core is
essentially the same thing as two
thousand 18s coffee lake so what's next
I don't mean Zen 2 + X s Pro Ultimate
Edition I mean what comes after TSMC 7
nanometer and Intel's 10 nanometer the
next plan lithography is 5 nanometer
from TSMC but some chip manufacturers
are attempting for 6 and even 3
nanometer however there is a point where
the laws of physics start to fail around
the pure micro scale of architecture
think I'm joking well unfortunately I'm
not there's a phenomena with FinFET
smaller than 7 nanometer called quantum
tunneling where particles pass through
barriers due to them being too miniscule
to contain it also known on a larger
scale as static leakage but when on the
smaller scale it can be the difference
between a correct calculation and a bsod
so how can this be overcome to continue
lithography progression well samsung has
been working on a technique for their
upcoming 7 nanometer processes called
EUV or extreme ultraviolet lithography
TSMC and GlobalFoundries won't be
switching to e UV until the second
generation 7 nanometer processes however
this ultraviolet technique is apparently
the only possibility of progressing past
6 nanometer and into the realm of beyond
quite scary when you think of it because
AMD's next 7 nanometer Rison chips might
just be the holy grail for a long time
to come after that there is a
possibility of problems especially on
high-performance desktop parts where
arguably manufacturers would face the
most problems so years ago some experts
predicted that 5 nanometer would be the
end of Moore's law and as we approach
this barrier it seems those experts
acquired those titles rightfully so
however lastly there is hope for us all
as tech enthusiasts and that is IBM's
graphene technology which is making
progress and if it does eventually hit
the market then it promises to be
revolutionary in the processing power it
contains anyway guys let me know in the
comment section below what you think of
7 nanometer 5 nanometer and the future
going forward with desktop enthusiast
parts
