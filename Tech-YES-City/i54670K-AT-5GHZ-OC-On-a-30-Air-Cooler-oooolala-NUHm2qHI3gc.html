for a while now do you guys I've been
saying my chip can get to five gigahertz
and it did this morning I got the five
gigahertz at 17 degrees ambient so
cooled down a little bit I've been
waiting for it to cool down a little bit
and all this is on a $30 air cooler so
let's pull that up for you guys there
you can see there the Animax T 40 this
thing is just freakin amazing value for
money anyway let's get onto the video
where I got manage to get this clock and
I'll show you the details it's not
exactly a 5 gig clock on all cause it's
actually 5 gig on one of the cause but
it's enough to get 5 gigs so technically
it's still 5 gigs anyway let's have a
look at the video all right so we're
booting up now and this message will
come up because yep didn't shut down
successfully last time because we had a
failover clock in there but this time it
should be okay so it's booting up and
it's in - it's on to the desktop so this
is a 5 gig on the first core and 4.9 on
the second and 4.9 on the third and
fourth but I'll get into that later I'll
get into that later we're going to open
up CPU Z for you guys and show you the
five gig on Haswell so let's zoom the
camera in a bit closer for you guys and
show you that there there it is five
gigs beber and the voltage is pretty
damn high but it's 17 degrees ambient
temp so it's pretty cool so it's I was
waiting for it to cool down before I
actually got this overclock as you know
I don't want to run a 5 gig overclock in
the heat of summer in the middle of
summer so it's been very hot as lately
but it's finally cooled down I was
finally able to get these this overclock
for you guys now the temperatures here
are oh this is over idle scenes here
it's almost idling like 19 degrees or 20
degrees over idle which is pretty damn
huge but this is a dealer chip - so
basically if you guys didn't know you
should deal it'd your house well if you
can I do recommend it so I'm going to go
over I'm going to go through some of the
settings for you guys right now I'll go
into the BIOS and sort of explain
everything I did to get this overclock
obviously I'm not going to load up
prime95 it'll probably crash this is
only just a pretty much a suicide run as
what they call it in the overclocking
community just the show mate CPU can
boot up in five gigs but armed
I'll just quickly change it back to my
4.6 gig profile as you know that's you
know I don't I don't feel too
comfortable running my chip at around
1.4 volt and keep in mind if your chip
is over 1.4 volt you can pretty much you
know one point four volts per notch this
threshold if you go over that threshold
you're pretty much in danger of actually
you know damaging a chip so really be
careful when you start playing with
those higher voltages obviously for me
like I said before I'll waiting for the
temperatures to cool down and you know
obviously it did so I was able to get
this kind of suicide run for you guys
but I'll go through the settings here
and what I did to sort of achieve this
overclock and I'll sort of detail it for
you guys but most of you know most of
time I'm comfortable running at four
point six but we'll go first here we'll
go through so basically one hundred
megahertz that's the base clock the CPU
strap is at one as well so you know if
you want to tweak you can use those
settings but for me I was just going for
a raw five GIGO clock so I didn't need
to touch that now the CPU PCIe pol if
you're using a low clock strap it is
recommended to use the Southbridge PLL
so that's something you guys might want
to remember now obviously with the cause
it's locked in at 50 so that's 500 which
gets you the five gig overclock now the
one of the most important things is to
hit dynamic mode here because if you hit
dynamic clip mode you are then able to
adjust every core individually so even
though it's five gigs you can actually
go later on to the CPU features and
change that but you see there the just
for now we're going to show you there's
the ring ratio is 4.1 I like to keep it
there it's a good sweet spot for the
ring ratio for my CPU every CPU will
have a ring what I call a ring ratio
sweet spot mine's 4.1 feel free to copy
my settings if you want to also the core
voltage there is one point three nine
volt which is pretty damn high I don't
like to take it over one point four volt
that's just me it's just me personally
I'm not going to really risk damaging my
chip as I can't afford to replace it but
let's go down to DRAM it's just clocked
at 1.5 volt the XMP profiles are more
than fine for house while it loves that
sort of I reckon it loves that you know
my testing I did with the frame latency
testing it loves the low seal timings
and you know the ramp speed doesn't
matter so much
on as well so the one PCH 1.5 voltage I
just upped that a little bit and up the
other one as well the one point zero
five to one point zero seven so here
we've got now if we go into CPU features
this is the most important thing I
disabled my C States obviously for this
suicide run I don't my faulty changing
up and down so I disabled that now you
see here one core the first core you can
change that to 50 which it might you
know my first core is capable of going
to five gigs the second core went to
four point nine the third and four cores
they're a little bit of a you know they
weren't as good as the other two and
they could only get to four point eight
now this is the biggest thing with
Haswell and you know a lot of people
messaging me like man I can't get my
chip you know it only goes to four point
two at one point three volt and now this
is made me realize something that maybe
your chip only has one bad call maybe
you can get the other calls to four
point six at one point three volt and
maybe keep one of the cores at 4.20 at
one point three volt so I'm going to
bring out a sort of intermediate sort of
advanced overclocking tutorial for
Haswell and I'm going to show you guys
in you know how to get the most out of
your CPU on this z87 platform so anyway
guys I hope you enjoyed this video and
you know it's sort of I'm gonna you know
I'm not really going to keep it at five
gig too much but if you did enjoy it
please give it a thumbs up and if you
have already subscribed take your seat
and I'll catch you guys soon with
another video peace out for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
