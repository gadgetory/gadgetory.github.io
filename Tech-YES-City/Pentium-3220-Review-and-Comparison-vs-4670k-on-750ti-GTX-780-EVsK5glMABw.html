max power
welcome back to techie city this is boo
Randy's coming back to you guys today
with a review of the intel pentium g
3220 now this is a $60 CPU from Intel
it's basically a cut-down version of
their more expensive CPUs and it
features a dual-core CPU with Intel HD
graphics and also a clock speed of three
gigahertz
now something important to remember that
this cpu as well it does have no hyper
threading and it does have some
important instructions that's disabled
and I'll get onto that later in the
clusion however one thing and the most
interesting thing that you guys wanted
to see was how does this pentium fare
with the 750 Ti and also on top of that
I decided to put this 750 Ti with my 4 6
7 TK overclock up to 4.6 gig and then
after all that I decided to put the
Pentium with the GTX 780 lightning and
see that against the 467 TK with the
lightning and the results were pretty
interesting it did kind of open up a
Pandora's box for me and I'll get onto
that in conclusion but let's get on them
now with a quick look at the product and
then we'll get onto the benchmarks so
the Intel Pentium comes boxed just like
any other Intel CPU in a blue box with a
fan and a plastic case holding your chip
up the top now one thing that was
interesting to note about the Pentium
was that it comes with a cut-down
version of a CPU cooler as well the 4
670 cake cooler was actually heavier and
it actually had a copper base plate
there as well so that was something that
I found pretty interesting also when I
deleted both the chips the actual die on
the Pentium was a little bit small in
the 4 670 K so it actually is
essentially a different chip as well per
se however let's get on now with the
benchmarks and you guys are dying to see
it and I'm dying to deliver it so first
up here we have these 750ti benchmarks
now this was done on my testbed with 16
gigabytes around clocked at 2000
megahertz
now the 4:6 Emenike was clocked at 4.6
gig and the encore ratio was clocked at
4.1 gig the G 3220 was clocked at 3 gigs
however I did stop the encore down to
2.9 gigs and with anyone with a Pentium
I highly recommend doing this as it will
yield you extra
FPS I managed to get an extra six six
percent FPS on cpu-bound games by doing
this tweak alone so it is important to
do this tweak and you manually have to
do it in your BIOS however with that
being said we look at the average frame
rates here Crysis 3 at ultra 1080p the
four 670 case scored twenty four point
seven two versus the Pentium which
scored twenty four point two eight the
minimum and the maximum were virtually
the same there was no difference there
so pretty much run a 750 Ti for Crysis 3
it makes no difference if you have a
penny more for 670 K based overclock
moving on to battlefield 4 7 TI 1080p
ultra again we have the same thing
happening here 71 point two eight
average FPS versus 70 point four four
with the minimum and maximum is being
virtually identical again we move across
the Skyrim house this is the one game
ultra 1080p where the 467 TK pulled
ahead by a longshot it was one hundred
and twenty three point one two versus
eighty nine point nine six and the
minimum and the maximum also were
significantly better on the four 670 K
this was just with the 750 Ti as well
however the 470 K was still GPU bound in
this game as you'll see all the 7080
lightning benchmarks in the next slide
but one thing to note though the Pentium
still offered a smooth gameplay
experience on the 750 Ti in Skyrim so it
was nothing to really fret about when we
move across now to ARMA 3 I ultros MBTI
at 1080p we have here thirty six point
three eight on the four 670 K versus
thirty six point three two so the
minimum and the maximum were virtually
the same there was no difference there
as well so basically one game out of the
four games showed an advantage to the
four 670 K when you coupled it with a
750 Ti let's move over now to the GTX
780 benchmarks which was kind of it was
a real blow to the Pentium I mean the
Pentium lost in every single game by a
longshot we look here at Crysis 3 we
have sixty eight point eight four frames
per second average FPS when we have the
four six seventy eight four four point
six gig and the GTX 780 overclocked as
well when we move now to the pentium g
3220 and scored only thirty
seven point six four and it also scored
a minimum frame rate so that almost half
of what the four six seventy K was
scoring now moving over to battlefield
again same example there was a big
difference there was one hundred and
fifty two point eight frames per second
versus a hundred and six point two eight
minimum and maximum frame rates were
also different as well when we move
across the skyrim there was absolutely
no comparison we scored ninety two point
one six versus a hundred and sixty four
point two eight so there was a big
difference there the minimum and the
maximum it will mean minimum has scored
almost threefold the minimum frame rates
maximum was pretty much almost double so
big difference there and also ARMA 3
ultra 1080p when we had the lightning in
there the four six seven TK managed to
get eighty point 8 4 FPS versus the
Pentium G 3220 which only got forty five
point three to minimum and maximum were
pretty much the same in scale in
relation to how far the Pentium 4 670 K
pulled ahead of the Pentium so basically
this also raised the question of when I
was playing these games on the GTX 780
the basically the 750ti felt better than
a GTX 780 did on the Pentium and that's
something I'll talk about in the
conclusion so let's move over now to the
conclusion so the verdict is in and men
is there a lot to talk about but
basically the most important thing first
and that is that the penny and 3220 are
$60 CPU when put with a 750 Ti gives one
satisfactory game experience at 1080p
man was I impressed especially with the
power consumption when you put these two
together in Yunnan Jean Valley
I was literally pulling 150 watts on the
Mini ITX rig in games it would use even
less I imagine probably like 120 watts
so to have such efficiency at your
disposal was damn impressive so that's
one thing I will say about both these
they work really well together they are
a great synergetic or combo and i highly
recommend them however that's where
things started to get messy when I put
the GTX 780 with the Pentium
honestly I mean as you guys saw in the
benchmarks the 46 70k destroyed the
Pentium when it was coupled with the 780
lightning and it was actually such a
weird experience for me that if I had
the choice if I'm gonna tell you
straight out if I had a 3220 and money
was no object I mean just a hypothetical
situation money was no object and I
could choose the 750ti
or a GTX 780 - coupled with the Pentium
I would choose the 750 Ti it gave a
smoother gaming experience when coupled
with the Pentium then did the 780 when
coupled with the Pentium that was
eye-opening for me it kind of reiterated
the importance of a CPU in a gaming rig
I mean I guess there's been this thing
that the CPU is not important in the
gaming rig but I'm here to tell you guys
right now when I did that 780 with the
Pentium which was a ridiculous
bottlenecking experiment it just proved
to me how important the CPU is in a
gaming rig so I can't stress that enough
always couple the right CPU with the
right GPU so if you're spending you know
X amount of dollars on a GPU then spend
and you know a similar amount and give a
decent CB you for that GPU however this
60 dollar budget CPU went coupled with
the budget graphics card performed
really well and that's something that I
wanted to test for and it did it really
well also I wanted to talk about one
thing I wanted to talk to you guys about
was the motherboard I am kicking myself
in hindsight on the teeth because for an
extra 25 dollars I could have got the
z87
n from gigabyte over my H 81 M ITX
motherboard and man it's a lot better if
a motherboard it's got Wireless on board
it's got a lot more phases on board way
better support for overclocking and then
I could have spent an extra $20 Angada
G's 32:58 which is an overclockable
Pentium so I'm kind of like damn why
don't I just spend an extra $45 and have
much better motherboard and have an
overclockable Pentium to play with so
that's something I'm sort of regretting
however if you're gonna get this
especially if you're gonna get a 750ti
then make sure you get a decent
motherboard I'd say like a H 81 m from
gigabyte that actually isn't going to
overheat
because the motherboard that I got the
asrock H 81m the hietzing got really hot
and honestly I would not be comfortable
running that thing on a game on a you
know everyday gaming rig so that's
something about the asrock H 81m that I
had to get off my chest
now something else that I will quickly
talk about with this CPU is that by
itself with even the asrock h 81 and
motherboard it makes an excellent cpu
for a home theater PC this is the
current configuration I have with my PC
downstairs the Mini ITX rig it's
basically a motherboard 4 gigabytes of
RAM and this CPU and this CPU does
absolutely find it running movies at
1080p checking emails browsing the
internet and it all does it while it's
only using literally I think about 50
watts from the wall so very impressive
if you guys are looking to get this chip
for a home theater PC especially a 1080p
home theater PC then I can thoroughly
recommend this processor the last thing
I want to talk to you guys about was the
SIF case that I had come through I will
review that soon and it wasn't
impressive the graphs God didn't fit the
power supply that came with it was
absolute junk I mean it it's rated at
300 watt and it cut off running this and
this and that has the potential to
damage it not just the power supply has
the Dench potential to damage every
component in your rig so that's
something that was really scary I mean
once it cut out once I didn't do it
again because everything was still okay
but yeah
that's something to keep in mind anyway
if you did enjoy this review of the
pentium 3220 then please give this video
a thumbs up and also if you have any
questions about this CPU or anything all
the tests in general in this video
please leave a comment in the comment
section below and don't forget to become
a yes man by hitting that sub button and
I'll roll the outro and I'll catch you
guys with another tech video very soon
bye
