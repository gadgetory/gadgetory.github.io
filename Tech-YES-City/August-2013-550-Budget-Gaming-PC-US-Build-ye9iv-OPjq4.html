his brownies coming back to you guys
today with august 2013 s 550 dollar
budget build now this month is by far my
favorite month of ever like a man that
didn't even make sense but my favorite
budge built of all time this thing is
just amazing it just screams value for
money when I was putting the parts and
the card I was like damn you've earned
an extra five dollars here you get a
better like a much better solution I you
know let's just get on with it this
thing is just huge first by the build is
the Zeus DVD 24 speed DVD burner now
this is just for a nice install so if
you ready have a side of DVD burner by
all means save yourself the money and
just use that you get a dollar off of
the promo code so don't forget to hit
that in and get a seven any dollars
let's get on to the next part of the
build now this is an interesting part of
the build so this case you get twenty
percent off with this promo code it ends
today so this case is amazing value for
money your twenty percent off and then
you get another fifteen all off with the
rebate so it makes I think it works out
to be seventeen dollars and for a case
like this you get a mesh front panel
there will not fully match but I like
semi meshed you get a power reset button
here you get front panel audio front
panel USB and it's on the top two I like
it there you've also got the top meshed
as well so if you want to put fans at
the top you can do that with this case
you've also got mesh there if you want
to add in fans later you also get a fan
with the case as well on the rear here
which is right now the best thing I like
about this case is that it has all
clip-on features here and you have a
slide-out drive base so this is just
going to be amazing like if you're
installing this is just going to make it
a piece of installation so easy so you
know you can slide these trays out put
your hard drives in slide them back in
you don't even have to it's a screwless
installation you don't even need a
screwdriver to install this so you will
probably need it for the motherboard oh
but for the drive bays here you just
take those clips out put the dry bean
and clip it in bang it's easy so it's
Brian easy that's how easy it is now
you've also got here cable management as
well so you got the extra bit there as
well they actually cut out if you wish
to put an extended graphics card in this
case you can so it's just really for
seventeen dollars I'm pretty damn
surprised not to mention the cutout here
when you are installing a aftermarket
cpu cooler so this thing just has
options not to mention it looks like
it's got the bottom panel meshed as well
so
dusts I guess dust prevention so this
thing has it all for $17 damn good bye
that's one of the best cases I've seen
for that for the net value in terms of
value for money let's get on to the next
part the bill the biostar so you guys
probably wondering biostar what the hell
is this brand it's a decent but it's a
decent brand it just comes packed with
features you get a fifteen dollar off at
the promo code so this board is $55 now
this is a 970 chipset harm from AMD now
this will support overclocking the board
also has heat sinks on it to support a
reasonable overclock this will support
the FX 8320 which we're putting in today
it's also got a PCI Express 16 2.0 which
is great it's going to be fine for the
greater scale we're putting in today he
also gets a lot of you look at some
sorta to there as well and you've also
got on board out a decent onboard audio
solution and a decent on board and I see
so I'm loving this thing the more you
get to know this board like your the
realtek alc 892 which is a decent
onboard audio solution so you're getting
a good onboard audio solution and a
decent on board and I see there or land
chipset so it's up to you guys but I
would spend the extra ten dollars over
the rainbow this month and get this
board because it's going to support that
FS 8320 it's going to support
overclocking it's going to give you a
bit of enthusiasts sort of a bit of
enthusiasts bit of enthusiam a bit of
enthusiasm into the build which you know
rarely gets put into a
five-hundred-dollar budget bill and I
really like that so not to mention it's
black and red as well the sooner it just
looks insanely good now this is probably
my favorite part of the build today or
my second favorite my favorite parts of
power supply but I'll get on to that
later this is the msi gtx 660 twin frozr
edition now these cards are insanely
good if you've read reviews on these
things you'll know that they're really
good they usually pricey but this thing
at 175 dolls is extremely good value for
money let's take a look at the cart you
get an overclocked card so it's already
clocked much higher than a reference
card not to mention this twin frozen
will support even a further higher
overclocks if you wish to do that not to
mention it looks really good as well and
it comes on a custom PCB as well from
MSI so this solution is really good
just for $175 it's amazing value for
money it will just it will play a lot of
games especially 1080p on 60s for 60
Hertz it'll play pretty much any game on
ultra settings so it's a really good
card if not high settings now this is
the best part of the thing you get a
free game with it as well splinter cell
blacklist so there's a free game they're
going to chuck that in for you guys
they're so awesome value for money I
really like this this is just an
insanely good bargain from newegg kudos
to newegg for doing that now this is my
favorite part the bill that's going on
do the power play EVGA have an 80 plus
bronze passed by with a three-year
warranty at $25 after twenty dollar
rebate now this thing is a 500 watt
power supply it's got two PCI Express
eight pins so it'll support I think up
to like a 7 950 which is pretty good
probably support a 79 Sony but i
probably wouldn't put a 79 70 on it 79
50 should be ok as long as you're not
clocking it too hard but you've got 40
amps on the 12 volt rail so that's what
it's saying there and that looks pretty
damn good you got 480 wats in the twenty
twelve volt rail as well so not to
mention the 80 plus bronze will save you
some power in the summer and it's not in
the summer and all times of the year but
you know a save us and power and the
power bill it you know it's better than
a non a d-plus power supply so
definitely a good buy their $25 i'll be
getting this I'd be pretty much
everything in this build today's like if
you're watching this now get this now
because this is going to sell out pretty
damn quick I'm pretty pretty surprised
at how cheeps on this office this is the
worst part of the build today I'm going
to be honest $58 I couldn't really find
any cheap ram so this is the best room I
could find for the for the money and
it's a single egg you but stick of a
data 1600 speed memory now you probably
be able to clock this stuff up to 18 66
pretty easy it's pretty tight time is
there 999 24 at 1.5 volts so really good
value for money comes with the heat sink
too so sport that little you know that
little overclock put this at one point
six volt get up to 18 66 possibly even
2000 megahertz and that'll be fine good
stuff from a data now we're moving over
to Amazon because Amazon have the deal a
big deal this is actually their third
favorite I know everything in this build
today is my favorite because it's huge
145 dollars for an 8320 you're getting
an eight core cpu you can clock this
thing to about 4.4 gigs you know this is
optional load the Santa max t40 it's
optional but you can if you get one of
these couple it with this you get up to
4.4 gigs stable no problems this thing
is just amazing value for money at 145
dollars you know you can stream you can
do a lot of rendering you can do a lot
of power using with this thing it'll
play games relatively well you know it's
just at 145 dollars it is a damn steal
so it's just insanely good value for
money pick this up if you can I'm
recommending it over the FX 6300 but if
you need to save money you can
definitely save yourself like 30 35
dollars and get the FX 6300 just this
thing is just really good value for
money at 83 sorry at you know 145 dolls
it's just insanely good pay for money
now the last part of the build is the
western digital blue one terabyte so
this is 63 dollars it's just a standard
hard drive from Western Digital comes
with a 2-year warranty I love western
digital hard drives they they work they
work well I've never had one fail on me
they're just a really good hard drive
manufacturer I really like them and not
to mention yeah they just they work so
people are saying well you know I had
some people commenting like them you
should get the black for gaming no it
doesn't make a difference they pretty
much the same speeds at both 7200 RPM
drives so yeah that's that and just yet
blacks are obviously a more reliable
they come with a five year warranty so
that's something to consider if you know
if you definitely if you're doing work
like if you if your job is on a computer
and you need reliability then you may
wish to go with a black so he goes after
rebates and discounts and promo codes so
make sure you hit those promo codes into
it all comes up to 550 for dolls and 43
cents which is just amazing value for
money for a build like this you're
getting recapping on this you're getting
a good bounce play good ramp good
graphics card good motherboard good case
you know everything is you know getting
an a core cpu a good hard drive
you know for five hundred fifty dollars
this thing is just amazing value for
money so not to mention if you have an
extra thirty-six dollars go get an anti
max t40 i just installed one on my house
well CPU and my god are they impressive
they're just the value for money on
these cpu coolers is insane they work
well they work extremely well and
they're cheap and the product is quality
so that's the best thing about the end
of Max t40 so I really like that now yes
so if you have any questions about this
compelled please leave a comment in the
comment section below and if you ladies
bill please give it a thumbs up and I
will catch you guys with the next budget
build which will probably be like a gtx
780 build so anyway guys p self and out
