tech top welcome back to check out
cities Barranco my back to you guys
today with episode 31 of tech talk and
today we have quite a big episode for
you guys going to be talking about API
is going to be talking about upcoming
gravis guards and video got slapped with
a lawsuit also at the end I'll talk
about why prices are so expensive
internationally compared to America more
pacifically I'll focus on Australia as
well since I got asked to pacifically
talk about that Sony let's move on into
the episode here and the first big news
is that AMD has stopped support for
mantle so they're going to be
discontinuing mantle and pretty much
putting it towards then you architecture
called Vulcan well it's actually not
their new architecture is actually a
company called Chronos that makes OpenGL
and so they're going to be putting their
developments in mantle into the new
architecture called Vulcan or pretty
much next generation OpenGL so this
actually looks really promising
especially since a company that has
experience with a cross platform api is
going to be getting behind it and
they're going to be building it up from
the ground up and it's going to be cross
compatible so this is going to be a good
API for the future so i'm really looking
forward to the developments with Vulcan
as I believe it's kind of like the right
answer to what a mantle should have been
but I mean don't be don't be sad like I
know some people will be sad about
mantle being discontinued I'm not sad I
mean that research has spurred better
things for the industry i mean DirectX
12 is looking promising as well but this
definitely looks good essentially it's
not going to be as as apparently it's
not going to be as core or straight to
the metal as mantle was but it will be a
lot better than say directx 11 or
another previous API since they are they
realize that they've got to make these
api is more efficient so we can get
better performance out of our hardware
so anyway that's i'm really looking
forward to this api really looking
forward to the developments i'm sure
steam is going to be a big
player in the car basically this with
support towards this API but not to be
outdone we've got here pretty much
Direct X 12 as well so apparently some
rumors have it the DirectX 12 could do
away with SLI and even crossfire and
basically just use the graphics cards to
their full potential even taking
advantage of that on board vram now I'm
a little bit skeptical of this and this
is certainly one of those things that
I'm going to be waiting and seeing for
but it would be awesome to get the most
out of your hardware right especially
since SLI and crossfire i currently have
that limitation on the vram where they
can only use the effective vram of one
of the cards essentially so this is
actually a good thing that I hope that I
hope the rumors are true that's all i
hope the room is about DirectX 12 or
even Vulcan it could be Vulcan they
didn't specifically mention which API it
was in this article so i'll be putting
all these articles in the description
below for you guys you can check them
out but DirectX 12 has been confirmed to
be on Windows 10 only now this is a
little bit oldest news but it kind of
makes sense since Microsoft is going to
be rolling out a free update for Windows
8.1 8 and 7 users so that's going to be
a good thing as well I think the whole
deal with Microsoft is they want to get
everyone on Windows 10 it'll make him a
lot easier to code instead of releasing
different code for all different types
of os's especially a good thing
especially if it's going to have directx
12 and especially if these numbers are
going to be what they are in these
benchmarks so we can see here this is
that star swarm benchmark which really
has a lot of physics to process and it's
pretty much one of the best examples
where you see mental perform a lot
better than directx 11 so what Microsoft
has decided to do is get a demo on
directx 12 going and you can see here
the performance differences between
DirectX 12 and mantle are not so big and
so that's something that's really good
news especially since the popularity of
DirectX 11 is pretty much in every game
so DirectX 12 you'd expect that to be
rolling out with every single game
there and this means that ultimately us
is the consumer we're going to win out
we're going to win with this a big win
because we're going to be getting better
graphics for our current hardware
configurations so that's a really good
thing I look forward to seeing Direct X
12 and both volk and I think they're
both going to be great for the industry
i think as currently your main to our
you made to api so direct x 11 and
DirectX 9 to some extent and also OpenGL
they're kind of like three main AAP is
used in pc games at the moment but let's
have a look at not to be a dumb medal
for Apple they've also got their own
thing going on and it's arm apparently
it's pretty good i mean metals looking
good for iOS so Apple have decided to
say hey we're going to take a page out
of your book too and we're going to make
our own API for our own iOS which is
mainly for smartphones so you can see
that Apple of sort of they're really
leading the smartphone market i mean i
don't have a apple smartphone personally
i mean i've got an android smartphone
much better value for money in my
opinion but i've actually got to review
this too i only recently bought this so
great smartphone from a brand called
huawei or something like that so a great
smartphone though I mean Apple Oh doing
their own thing and they're obviously
really successful right there they
currently like the biggest company in
the world I think so Apple had
definitely taken their own approach to
it they've developed met medal for there
are for their own iOS API so it's pretty
interesting the developments that we're
seeing recently and I'm pretty sure
mantels a great thing in that it sort of
showed all these different companies
that hey this is what you can do with an
API and these are the benefits that you
can get out of it so that's a pretty
cool feature I do wonder though what
androids response or Google's response
to this is going to be because if metal
starts grant gaining a lot of support
then obviously that's going to make the
hardware on the isle the apple
smartphones utilized a lot better and
that's going to be giving them a huge
advantage in some benchmarks making it
obviously making their smartphones as
seem like they're better value for money
so I wonder what Google's response to
this is going to be it's going to be
interesting to see how Android or Google
with their Android respond to this I
mean I'm not too in the know with
smartphones
maybe some guys wanna chiming in the
comments like in advance I say sorry
about smartphones it's not really my
field of expertise but anyway let's move
on now to steam Gabe good old Gabe has
decided to launch a massive sale for
linux games and basically there's just a
huge amount of cool titles here so if
you're a linux-based OS user you can
take advantage of some of these stale
sales and get in here for some pretty
cool games I mean civilization beyond
Earth they've got that going out you
know which it too so you got some cool
games there that you can take advantage
of and get them for really cheap on the
steamos sale so apparently lately a lot
of companies have launched different
prototypes for their steam machines one
of the prototypes that's really sort of
caught my eye with zotac and they've
sort of said hey we're going to go with
a skylake and a mobile version of the
gtx 970 and they're going to put it
together in one steam box and this thing
is going to use less power than a
hundred watts which is actually going to
be pretty impressive for the performance
you're going to get out of this thing so
this thing will costs probably yeah I
think they're saying it started to be
about a thousand dollars which actually
isn't too bad I mean especially for
something that's only going to use a
hundred watts and will be good for a
home theater PC because it won't be
using much power at all anyway so it'll
get good performance figures but of
course you could build obviously build a
better desktop variant which is what i
always recommend being a desktop
enthusiast myself so anyway let's move
on now to some different news this is a
broad well so broad well a brob okay
anyway and we're going to talk typically
about broadwell k because i got asked to
talk about Broadwell k in a previous
tech talk and basically i started
talking about broad well in general one
guy in the comments went ballistic is
like man the mobile chips have already
been released it's like and i wasn't
really referring to the mobile chips yes
broadwell you has already been released
that's the mobile variants for laptops
that's already been released we're not
even bothering focusing on that because
the yields worse
acceptable for the mobile chips if you
guys did no mobile variants of Intel's
chips are clocked lower generally
because they use less power and you want
them to use less power in a laptop due
to how small laptops are however with
broadwell k essentially the desktop
variants or just generally broad well as
it's named here this actual article and
this leak is about right actually after
looking at this timeline this makes a
lot of sense I mean as we can see here
broad Wells looking like it's going to
be released in May and then followed by
Sky lake later this year I'd say
probably that's a little bit too early
for Sky lake s sky like you the mobile
variant does look like it will get
pushed in sometime and maybe june july
though sky like the actual desktop
variant of it i believe that'll be
pushed out probably in maybe august
possibly july at the best and then
you've got obviously the six and eight
core variants being pushed back quite a
bit though one thing with Broadwell k is
there's there have been this recent
release of a bios version from a zoo so
i actually tracked it up here and yes
Zeus in an update have released support
for broadwell k or Broadwell desktop
chips in one of their BIOS updates now
people this got sort of the rumor mill
going crazy but look it's not such big
news because like asrock azusa gigabyte
i just pronounce it as zeus it's just
old school don't don't hate me for it
like I know there's some guy in the
comments yeah but it's I don't really
care but I've just always said it a zoo
since I got into computers but anyway so
anyway getting back on topic here these
companies like a Zeus asrock and goodbye
they all get access to the Intel CPUs in
pretty much the Alpha stages and that's
a long time ago so pretty much I'm
pretty sure they would have got access
to broadwell k last year they would have
got a early sample and then they can
start coding their boss for it so the
fact that this bias update is released
it's not such a big thing just further
sort of if anything it further supports
the
schedule in this article that Broadwell
is going to be released maybe sometime
in May so we can expect to see broadwell
and broadwell k released in May and then
sky like the desktop variant released
sometime later this year that kind of
looks a little bit it makes more sense
especially from a selling point to
release sky lake and Broadwell at the
same time just didn't make any sense at
all as I pointed out one of my previous
tact aux so this this does make sense
anyway so let's say let's move on to
some necks some other news here and that
is marvel vs sandforce and it's
something that I've always sort of
wondered about but I recently got some
solid answers for myself when I started
benchmarking the bx 100 also
benchmarking my old Intel 335 against
the MX 100 as well and it's always it's
funny this is one of those funny things
that now it all makes sense now that I
can process at all because when I got
the Intel SSD and I've used other SSDs
before that as well I've used the
corsair force 3 i think i've also used
an a data it also use the western
digital though i can't expect a hard
drive to perform as well as an SSD i
think anyone can't expect that but
basically the marvel controller up until
this point in time is the only
controller on an SSD that I've used
where I'm getting really consistent
results we're talking like I'm doing
tech talk for you guys right now I'm
recording off my desktop I'm recording
the desktop and my webcam and audio both
on the desktop and from the line in and
that takes up a lot of data and so my
temporary storage to do this is off my
SSD and so my SSD has to perform
consistently and if it doesn't we're
going to get dropouts we're going to get
sinking of audio and video it's going to
go crazy and things are going to drop
out and I'm gonna have to retake the
whole thing again and it's funny because
what ever since I got the Intel SSD I've
had these audio sync video sync problems
and I've had video being shorter than
audio I mean than the actual desktop
video footage but with
Marvel in the MX 100 I've never had that
happen not once and when I did this HD
tune pro benchmarks in my recent be x
100 review it all made sense so what I'm
going to say with sand falls vs marvel
and verse other controllers for that
matter on the SSDs I know there's a few
other controllers out there is that the
Marvel controller works it's very
consistent and this is why people are
big advocates for Marvel controllers on
SSDs because they're so consistent of
course the nand flash does make a
difference and what nand flash they use
on those SSDs but i also would argue
that the controller matters as well and
that's really important and in my
experience the Marvel controller is the
one to go for so obviously I don't know
how the silicon motion performs yet but
you know those early benchmarks kind of
showed me that the MX 100 with its
Marvel controller is the SSD to get for
the money and that Marvel controller is
the granddaddy so that's just going to
for me that kind of settles the debate
for me so I'd go with a marble
controller if you are indeed using an
SSD for a workstation that's just what
I'd like to advocate if you're using it
for just games and suddenly that's not
going to make a difference but for
actual proper workstation productivity I
would go with the Marvel control on your
SSD so let's move on now to some new
news with the GTX 970 and that is that
Nvidia have been slapped with a lawsuit
for their GTX 970 and the Miss
advertising of it now what is going to
happen here I don't know it's up to the
judge I think ultimately though you know
nvidia did make a mistake and whether it
was a deliberate mistake or it was non
deliberate is up to the judge to decide
so i don't know the outcome of this but
look they advertised it as 4 gigabytes
of vram and you're effectively truly
only getting three point five gigabytes
of vram for gaming so I mean look then I
don't know I don't know what's going to
happen but is the GTX 970 still a good
card for the money and that's like yes
it is it's still a really good card for
the money
but yeah I look in the last tactile guy
blasted and video ready for it I just
don't want to talk about it anymore you
know it's funny because like I just
don't get one last thing I'll add to
this whole thing is I just don't get why
people haven't done the right benchmark
yet like someone please give me a gtx
980 and i'll do the benchmarks and i'll
give you concrete answers that you need
to know it's pretty simple get a gtx 980
underclock it and then compare it with
when you get the performance say you're
running a benchmark only utilizes two
gigabytes of erm get them running at the
same performance so you're overclocking
the gtx 970 you're getting and running
around the same performance on the GPU
cores and then you throw those vram
intensive benchmarks on both the 980 and
the 970 and that will give you your
answers that'll give you definitive
answers in my opinion so I don't know
why no one has ran that benchmark yet
but I would like to see them run that
benchmark that will give you the
concrete answers you're looking for but
anyway let's move on now to other news
nvidia have announced the titan x and so
this is their new big daddy that is
essentially going to be pretty
ridiculously overpriced so it's going to
carry a parent it's going to carry a
price tag in excess of a thousand
dollars and it's going to carry 12
gigabytes of vram GD @ gddr5 vram on
board and it's also going to carry over
3,000 cuticles I think 3072 cuticles
there the maxwell cuticles as well so
this thing is going to be a lot faster
than a 980 and any previous graphics
card nvidia have released now there's no
denying that this thing's going to be a
beast but the problem is is that the
price per performance is going to be
stupid it's going to be stupidly low so
i'm not going to be recommending this
graphics card already even before it
comes out though but i will say one
thing this is why Nvidia make money this
is why their balance sheet you ask any
account to take a look at invidious
balance sheet and they will tell you
it's a healthy company and this is why
they're healthy company because
there are people out there with huge
amounts of money and they just don't
care they want the best performance
right now and they can get that with the
tight necks AMD don't have that option
at the moment so I would like to see
them push the i-93 90x out as soon as
possible and this is where we're going
to move on now with the 390 ex
apparently it's been rumored that it was
in one of their computers and it does
have a fourth hour 4000 stream
processors so the 3 90 x is definitely
looking pretty good as well though if it
is indeed only have if it doesn't only
have 4096 stream processors that's not a
huge increase over the i9 290x so it
remains to be seen as are we getting a
new architecture with the r9 390 X are
we getting hbm are we getting all these
benefits I kind of it I'm just hearing
so many conflicting reports on the
internet at the moment where I don't
know what AMD is going to do because we
know that Nvidia are going to release an
ax we know that's coming and then later
on down the track we know something like
the GTX 980 TI is coming and I'd say the
980 TI is probably coming in august or
something like that but we don't know
when's the 39 TX exactly coming when's
the 380 coming I just I can't give you
answers but we all know that the tight
necks will probably be released later
this month if not early next month so
but what's AMD doing you know so that
they as this report says here they've
lost some market share in the discrete
desktop video card market and that's
because of Maxwell and they release that
architecture early and it was a better
architecture than their previous Kepler
and we've got to get an architectural
improvement from AMD and you know
whether you like AMD or not they bring
competition to the market and we need
that competition is in and consumers it
does drop the prices of the graphics
card so I'm hoping AMD can get something
out as soon as possible and I hope it is
good because we all need it as desktop
enthusiasts so one of the last topics
that I'm going to talk about today is
why is everything in Australia so
expensive or internationally for that
matter but we're going to focus mainly
on Australia with this and I'm going to
play devil's out
get here and say that they're actually
the prices in Australia aren't too bad
now I know some guys going to be going
crazy on the dislike button already but
hear me out hear me out okay so
basically in Australia we pay ten
percent GST on everything now in America
they don't play pay any sales tax in
some parts of America so we've already
got a ten percent disadvantage and now
when you look at it this is a good
article i'll put this article in the
description below goes through some of
the basics about why australia is so
expensive but one of the things that i'm
going to focus on is the minimum wage
they say higher wages here but that's
not the case we're going to go a little
bit more in depth and we're going to
look at the minimum wages because this
is one of the more important things to
look at and then we'll go over some
prices as well so basically in Australia
you've got a minimum wage of 16.2 to US
dollars per hour that's actually pretty
damn good we look at the United States
we go all the way down the bottom here
to the United States and we can see that
their minimum wage is 7.25 dollars per
hour obviously in some states it's going
to be more than others but you can see
there that now people doing these basic
business to business services like
delivering parts from the port to the
stores they're on you know a little bit
over minimum wage possibly minimum wage
so all these costs add up for businesses
and they have to throw that on the end
retail price that you pay for and so
when the minimum wages are a lot higher
in Australia then they are in the United
States we can't expect to get the prices
that they can in the United States if
that's making any sense also another
thing is is that the prices aren't
actually too bad so I've just got a
random example here the r9 290 so in
Australia you can currently get the r9
290 for 393 dollars if we look at them
if we look at America we can concert the
UK we can currently get that over there
for 225 pounds so if we go to our little
friend Google here so we're just quickly
go into Google and we'll go on 225
pounds to aud and that's 443 australian
dollars so in the inning
and they're paying fifty dollars more
for the same graphics card than we are
so if anything other parts of the world
are worse off than Australia compared to
America though let's have a look at
America itself okay so without rebates
they're paying 282 dollars for an hour
9290 currently so let's have a look 282
USD to AED we'll have a quick look and
we see it's 368 dollars so you add ten
percent sales tax on to that GST you've
actually got more than what we're paying
in Australia so that's not too bad in
the defense of Australia so Australia's
prices aren't too bad we look at the
worst example here this is the one that
I picked out is I believe it's New
Zealand yeah New Zealand to paint four
hundred and eighty eight dollars for at
r9 290 so if we do 488 nzd to aud we can
see here that they're paying 465
australian dollars for that exact same
graphics card so ultimately australia
isn't too bad we're not paying too much
when we compare ourselves directly to
America now obviously a year ago the
Australian dollar was doing a lot better
against the USD but it has since come
down so prices will go up naturally with
that since the American dollar is the
world reserve currency and that'll be
for a while to come I mean the USD is
what all the big banks use as their
federal reserve so as a reserve currency
and that ain't going to change anytime
soon so yeah that's I mean look it's not
too bad you know things could be worse
you could be in New Zealand it's also
some other points i'll quickly throw in
as well as that we're a lot more
demographically dispersed then americans
are if anything I mean you look at
prices in Japan or about the same as
they are in Australia and I mean you see
the Japanese are all basically stuck on
this little island compared to a
straight so if anything I should be
complaining about prices in Japan being
not as good as they are in Australia or
in America since we're so
demographically congested here so anyway
that's about all I can say is the prices
aren't too bad industry
yeah you know definitely could be worse
depending on where you are in the world
so I hope that answers the question of
why our price is so expensive in
Australia there the two sort of mean
things that I wanted to touch base with
also that article goes over some other
basics as well as to why prices are two
are expensive more expensive in
Australia than they otherwise are in the
States so many ways that's about it for
tech talk episode 31 though one thing I
will talk about is some is one game in
particular that I'm looking forward to
and that is pillars of eternity from
obsidian man this game looks good Wow
like these are the guys who made
boulders gate to shadows of em and it
was amazing that was like my favorite
RPG of all time had this great mystic
storyline to it it just got me so
immersed I've never been immersed in an
RPG like I have with Baldur's Gate 2 and
so I'm really looking forward to pillars
of eternity I'm really hoping that
obsidian can deliver are just another
immersive experience because I haven't
had a good pc gaming experience for a
while actually and I really am looking
forward to this game and I hope it
delivers I hope you guys if you're
looking for a really cool sort of RPG
then you might want to check this out
it's a it's essentially it combines both
a real-time and a turn-based engine
together to make one pretty cool game
and the customization is just so good in
any game from obsidian and I'm really
looking forward to it so if you have any
comments or questions about any of the
articles in today's tech talk then
please leave a comment the comment
section below and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can if you enjoyed this
tech talk and please give it a thumbs up
and I got the old mic stand back I
actually got this crap one in like don't
buy one of these things seriously it's
like this cheap desktop arm and it's
just so bad man like came off without me
even touching and just like rattled off
and I really tightened it down as well
just an absolute piece of junk anyway
eyes I'm out of here I hope you enjoyed
this episode and if you have any
requests as well or anything you want me
to talk about in the next tech talk then
be sure to drop a comment in the comment
section below and I'll be I'll have a
look into it for you anyway peace out
