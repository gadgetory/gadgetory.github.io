back here today I've been gone for like
three weeks
sorry about that I just got my internet
back and got her Cuddy TV as well which
is like cable TV from the internet so
it's really good like the riccati TV
does not slow down your internet either
so few guys in Japan you're thinking
about getting it I recommend it's really
cheap so today I wanted to because my
wife's gone out for the day she's gone
out to Tokyo for like the whole day for
a friend's wedding so I'm here with my
little Bubbe little Brian jr. so say
hello to everyone hello so there he is
so he's armed I wanted to talk today
about yeah having a child in Japan and
what it was like for me more
specifically the whole experience so um
yeah we me and my wife we you know we
got she was she got pregnant last year
um I'd say probably the August yeah she
got pregnant August and he was born on
May the 16th
so the whole process was pretty like my
wife didn't have many problems during
the pregnancy
um it was pretty straight forward but
like what I want to talk about is the
actual birth in Japan and the health
care and stuff and its really good so
basically you don't get a baby bonus in
Japan if you have a baby here what they
do though is they give you the they pay
for the whole birth like all the
hospital fees and and like some of the
you know all the other expenses and it's
about five thousand dollars so you know
he got to stay in the hospital my-my
wife stayed in the hospital seven nights
the usuals five that she started labor
early so she had to go in to go into our
in the hospital early she was in labor
for a long time so it was pretty hard
and then um after that we you know he
was born and it was pretty smooth after
that he was a really good baby doesn't
cry much and he's going to be both an
Australian and Japanese citizen
so he's going to take the both
nationalities they say hello to youtubes
he's looking at the screen he's only two
months old now they but he's a gorgeous
little thing he's such a good little
baby he's the most beautiful little
thing in the world I wanted to show you
guys little Brian jr. today so see here
is they like the screen he looks at it
he likes it so if you guys yeah if you
if you you know if you meet a Japanese
partner and if you come over here and
you get married and you decide to have a
baby it I definitely there's nothing
wrong with having a baby in Japan I'd
recommend it thoroughly after speaking
with my mom in Australia you only get to
stay overnight like one night and then
they kick you out in the next day which
is pretty bloody tough like lads
ridiculous health care here is really
good you know he everything was really
good the nurses were fantastic
obviously the hospitals are going to be
different as as you go from city to city
and our city was luckily really good
like the the staff were really good that
the doctors the nurses were top-notch so
I recommend it you know late lastly yet
so the whole and all from the start to
finish you know having a baby in Japan
is really like its it's really good like
there's no there was no things that I
got angry about in the whole process
there was no complications
no barriers now the only thing I'm sort
of worried about is his head shaping
when he sleeps sort of shaping a bit
weird but I don't know I've got to talk
to the doctor more about that so if you
guys have any tips I'd love to hear them
but in general if you want to have a kid
in Japan I recommend it like it's no
it's the health care and all that it's
really good here so here guys anyway but
yeah I'm back I'm back on a YouTube now
I'm going to be putting out some more
videos but I've got to take care of
little bub today which is so I'm going
to not be putting up any like I put up
some quick videos that we just on my
computer that I've been meaning to put
up for a while but other than a no-go
really no videos coming so not until
tomorrow so I'll be submit more videos
coming wait a little bit man okay say
hello YouTube
hello so yeah and these these are half
these half Japanese half Australian and
little boy and he's a cute gorgeous
little thing you guys want to say hide a
little Brian jr.

hugger he's bald this thumbs up the
video if you don't like his baldness
thumbs down the video and then he will
he'll know if everyone likes his little
cute little bald bald hair at the moment
guys if you have any questions about
yeah like I'm marriage as well I'll
probably do another vlog on marriage as
I'm that I probably that's one of
discovered more information I still
don't know are memo memo wife are
married but and the bill the marriage is
recognized in Australia but I'm still
yet
I've still got to apply for a permanent
residency fees and stuff like that so I
will have to do that as soon as I can
but yet I will get I will get another
vlog on actually marriage in Japan and
so yeah having a kid in Japan certainly
it's a great experience um you guys
really I recommend it so I can't say
enough good things about this little
gorgeous thing is you know I want to
have a couple more kids they're they're
beautiful and you know if you guys don't
want to have kids uh I was in this exact
same thinking same set mind frame as you

that might that's that at the state of
mind about you know two to three years
ago but then I met my wife and
everything just changed
