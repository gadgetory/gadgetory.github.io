of days ago I needed a bit of R&amp;amp;R and I
was seriously just burnt out after that
trip I think I did in total like 17
videos but also filmed another 2 which I
finished off when I got back here but
people are wondering how do I pack for
these events there's a few questions
that run under the scenes which I'm
going to quickly address now first off
international travel and how it works
with fitting so many used parts in that
suitcase is a two-fold process first of
all you need to use your clothes to
actually cushion the parts
second of all you need a pretty big
suitcase with these two powers combined
you can be fitting in all these parts
like I've done here on the desk and
still manage to have a good trip now why
would anyone go directly to a country to
hunt for used parts I don't know I don't
book a plane ticket and go hey I'm going
international just to do a parts hunt
that would be stupid in terms of price
performance but why I do that is because
I piggyback these parts hunts off of
events like Computex for example or if
last year when I was in Vietnam for the
gal acts overclocking tournament I did a
parts hunt there and so how it works is
I request the companies to send me a
couple of days earlier and then I'm
happy to cover the events for them and
that way you guys and me we all get that
use price performance hustle going on
and also the companies get taken care of
when I do the events and I'm more than
happy to do that for a plane ticket and
accommodation but on top of that if you
guys are travelling to a certain
location and you're like me and you love
doing a bit of use price-performance
then it's always a thing that you can
keep in the back of your mind for
instance if you want to enjoy a
particular area or overseas and you want
to do something on the side like I'm
doing then these are the methods you can
follow and you can come back with a
little kitty in your suitcase and
hopefully make a bit of money after the
trips done and of course you've enjoyed
yourself if you want to learn how to
make a spaceman jacket
dear sponsor is probably not for you but
if you want to learn the fine arts of
graphic design freelance ultra proneural
ship music production film and video
then skill share has an online learning
community with thousands of classes and
you can get a premium membership with
unlimited access for as little as $10 a
month now for me personally I've been
using this to help improve my social
media as I'm an introvert and that's one
thing I struggle with I'm learning just
how to better communicate across social
media in general but the best thing
about today's video sponsor Skillshare
is if you use the link in the
description below
you'll get two months of premium access
for free what are you guys waiting for
put that link below for you let's get
back to the hustle but what we've got
right here on the desk is essentially 19
used components and the good thing is
all these components are in working
condition they're absolutely fine if
tested them all so they make it back
through the flight okay
now in terms of customs I really never
get pulled over I mean when you're going
through customs they do x-ray your stuff
if they find there's a problem they'll
usually just question me and I'll be
like yeah I picked up some computer
parts I just tell them this is sort of
like a passion of mine I love use
price-performance hustle and they sort
of understand they never really take it
any step further it's just computer
parts it at worst they'll just pick a
component out of my suitcase take a look
at it and go yeah this guy's absolutely
fine keep going
but anyway besides making a heap of
value out here on the table I'm also
going to tell you guys behind the scenes
a little bit and show you what a normal
operation in the week of techie air city
is like in terms of making even more
value so get you used price-performance
capes on strap on in and let's have some
fun
so here it is clean slate we have
cleaned off the tackiest desk here but
from now I'm going to go pay a visit to
a local computer store called X gaming
systems this is king of the coasts own
operation now which is built up over the
last two years but how it is is someone
traded in a PC they bought off him and
my sort of objective was to do a
trade-in value that he would then buy
back off me if that makes any sense so
we're gonna go take that computer over
to his shop now and go see what's
cracking but also on that note I did buy
an rx 570 off him that was faulty
someone go get that replaced too so a
little bit of a midday hustle here
so we just got back now and we got the
replacement rx 570 also got the 500 in
pineapples that's what we call an
Australian 50 and we got two cases here
that Kevin no longer wanted he said they
didn't fit the LED bling and I said
that's not a problem around tech yeah
City then more than welcome to stay here
I'll find him a new home but basically
with Kevin over the last two years he's
gone from a garage to or if you're on
the Gold Coast we do say garage and he's
gone from there and built up a whole
business in his garage and then
essentially now made a local business at
a storefront and it was crazy to see all
the development and progress he's made
and especially crazy because I haven't
seen him for literally like five months
and in that time he's just been going
crazy he's even got an LED set up for
taking photos of the builds so I guess
that thing of LEDs selling pcs he's
taking it to a whole new level where
he's got the RGB desk that can match the
color of the build but at the same time
he is making a whole business that's
thriving off of use price performance
which was really crazy to see so that's
what Kevin and ex gaming systems his
company has been doing over the last
five months but without a side why don't
we start making something out of these
two little brand new cases here well
they're not brand new yet they are used
but I gotta turn them into brand new
[Laughter]
so it's now the next morning and I got a
little bit carried away last night I
built this first one up and I'm like
well wires will build the second one up
and think about these pcs is why I'm not
doing dedicated videos to them like in
terms of a usual price-performance rig
on the channel is that I don't really
know how to price these up because both
these rigs here have kind of the same
thing in common and that's that I've got
two cases that were pretty much going in
the bin I got them gifted to me and then
also we've reused the graphics card
that's come back to life and in this
case we've got a CPU cooler that I got
for free use that we got a hard drive
for like I think this one costs $8 and
then we've got a motherboard in Taiwan
that was $10 a power supply that
otherwise would have been chucked in the
bin we've got an RX 570 that was
replaced and so you can start to see
that this one here is going to literally
cost next to nothing to put together I
did manage to chuck in an SSD which is
going to raise the value of the rig and
put 16 gigabytes of RAM in and an i7
2604 mid specs but it doesn't really
have the bling but that's not to worry
because you know not everyone is after
LEDs or at least I'm going to be testing
that by testing that and selling it a
little bit cheaper than I otherwise
would sell something of similar spec
with LEDs inside but this one right here
again we've got the graphics card that's
been sort of tech yes loved and then
it's brought back to life got a cool
that I had lying around a gigabytes of
RAM multiple that we picked up in Taiwan
for around 15 bucks and then we got a
hard drive 500 give a hard drive that
was pretty much taken out of another OAM
system and then we have this power splay
here which I picked up on a deals hunt
for around 40 Aussie dollars I believe
if you haven't seen that I'll put the
link up here but you may also notice I
did add a DVD drive in this case and
that was simply just to fill out the
front panel here so it doesn't look too
bizarre and the whole system is
completed but when it comes down to it
these two cases were cases that were
just filthy
no one wanted them a lot of the parts
inside were dirty filthy but we've
managed to bring them back into
something that is working as usual a
hundred percent looks really good
performs really good and
is really good now I have installed
windows on both these machines so they
do boot up absolutely fine
I've just got to run them through stress
tests but another thing to come out of
this video is really cool in my opinion
that's just reusing old parts I do tell
you guys you should never really chuck
out a good part especially if it's got
potential and this cooler here is a lot
better than these newer coolers that
they put on their CPUs there's a lot
more metal inside
I believe the fan is a lot better - and
how it spins up and with that you've now
got a cooler that's going to cool down
an i7 2600 to the point where you could
even overclock on them back in the day
on the dual cores so the fact that this
board had LGA 775 support I did want to
utilize that and get some value out of
it and I certainly have but also other
parts in this bill do come together to
synergize the whole total package so do
let us know what you think of this rig
and then this last one here of course
we're just putting something together
with an i-5 34 70 and a 79 70 and it's
gonna perform really well even at 1080p
and still get decent performance there's
a real funny thing about 79 70 is back
when it was released I think at the end
of 2011 it had that three gigabytes of
vram and people thought it was too much
for what was at the time but
fast-forward to this day in 2019 that
three gigabytes of vram is really paying
off for this card considering its lost
at all that time and it hasn't been
heavily used because over seven years of
straight GPU usage will do some funny
things to a GPU but in this case looks
like it's looking okay I mean the caps
checked out I think it just had a little
bit of a problem with some thermal paste
over some of the traces but hopefully
both these rigs are good to go once I
stress test them and put them on the
market they should make some people
happy on a budget so closing out this
vlog you can see that around tech ES
City and even guys like Kevin from axe
gaming systems you can just use a lot of
parts that otherwise would get chucked
out in the rubbish and you can utilize
them to make magic happen in the case of
Kevin he had things like office pcs
going on where he's utilizing those a
threes the second and third gen I 3 s
and even throwing in an SS
which costs around about 19 USD I think
you can get them in Australia for as low
as 25 Aussie dollars and so if you
chucked that in the system and even if
you charge like $80 for it you're still
gonna be making profit because a lot of
those parts especially in the case of
the motherboards and the CPUs you're not
gonna be putting them in gaming pieces
because you're just not going to get the
value generally nowadays people do not
want a 3s and I've found this out the
hard way when I even tried to sell an i3
80 100 which is better than an i5 3470
for example but because it had the i3
logo on it
no one wanted to buy it it was crazy
pretty much for gaming pcs nowadays
people don't want Pentium to write
threes but you can still use them in
office pcs where people just want to use
Excel for instance or browse the web
they're not going to need anything more
than two cores and especially two cores
four threads and if you couple in an SSD
with it it's gonna actually be quite a
fast office PC where retailers are
charging in excess as least in Australia
more than 500 Aussie dollars for
something of similar performance so in
closing out today's vlog you guys see
that I just like to create value out of
literally everything especially when
people otherwise discard that and they
think it's not worth anything to them
personally they just think it's trash
it's otherwise should go in the garbage
but you can then reutilize that read
tweak it and then make it into something
that someone would find very useful and
also you can make a little bit of Bank
on the side so it's something that I
really enjoy doing I know a lot of you
guys out there and a lot of people
around me here on the Gold Coast enjoy
doing this too it really is a cool hobby
to have a cool passion but with that
aside I hope you guys enjoyed today's
video and if you did then be sure to hit
that like button for us but also let us
know in the comment section below what
was your favorite of these two pcs or if
you have any questions about anything
else featured in today's vlog them be
sure to drop a comment in the comment
section below I mean some of these pcs
man they just get tech guest loving and
it gets administered pretty damn quick
just that light coating of multi-purpose
spray on that build true brings it up
look at Schmidt
and beautiful and with that aside I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon but also if you want two
months free premium access to skill
share links in the description blur
today's video sponsor two months free
got nothing to lose and I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon he's out
for now bye
