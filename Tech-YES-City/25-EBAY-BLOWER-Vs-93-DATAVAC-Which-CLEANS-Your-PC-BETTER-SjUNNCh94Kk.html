video what do you mean different every
video is different Brian wouldn't that
make it normal anyway
two blowers one here $25 us shipped to
your door internationally which would
make it like 30-something Australian
dollars this one here you can get it off
Amazon for I believe 93 US dollars and
it's Trey it's a little bit more
expensive because it is made in the US
and in the UK as well I think it's 150
Australian 100 quid if you're in the UK
mate anyway before we get on with the
video this one here it does indeed feel
like 25 bucks you're just getting
plastic and a motor this one here you're
getting a pretty good solid build
quality it's all metal it feels proper
the attachments as well are another big
thing about this it's got the proper
attachments so I'm curious to see how
the results will play out that also with
this I mean come on what is this I get
an anti-static wrist rest with this if
you guys don't know this is out just get
out of my house custody
and let the testing begin first off we
have here a dirty case everything's
dirty and it's got a massive jungle
sandwich so I think we should clean up
this jungle sandwich first before we
conduct the test
so the initial results are in and they
both did a pretty good job the data vac
and the eBay banger you see here that
fan the Intel heatsink that had a lot of
dust on it now it's actually pretty
clean on both counts however there was a
difference in my opinion and that was
when I was cleaning this graphics card
down the left-hand side was the data vac
and there was dust blowing out but then
on the right side we had the eBay banger
and the proof kind of came when the eBay
banger was blowing over this left hand
side there was no dust going away but
when we'll blown on the right-hand side
you can see that the data vac was taking
away some of the eBay bang is dust so it
does do a better job you could
definitely feel the power and even hear
it as well
next up here is my daily driver of a
keyboard you can see that oh look at all
that filth I mean this thing is filthy
we are gonna do half the keyboard with
the data vac half the keyboard with the
eBay banger
so the second result is in this is my
creative keyboard and this was where the
biggest difference came in my opinion
the data vac did a phenomenal job you
could even see hair just flying out of
this keyboard I was surprised that
actually how dirty my keyboard was I
didn't realize until I started cleaning
it the eBay banger that did an okay job
I mean it was blowing out the dust but
there was still hair caught in
especially up here in the corner there
was hair caught in that the the banger
couldn't remove but the Dada vac did you
can see they have blowout at the end so
I definitely give the victory here to
the data vac and if you were into
cleaning a lot of keyboards I'd say that
the eBay Bang it just doesn't hold up
because if you're cleaning a keyboard of
a song and there's still hair stuck in
there that's not really a good result
and now for the last and final test this
is the Corsair air 740 and this dust
filter is just almost impossible to
quickly remove you've got to literally
do all these weird difficult screws then
you go take the whole front panel off
and get the dust filter out it's my only
complaint with the air 740 other than
that I love this case it's my favorite
case of all time so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna do half and half again
left side data vac and sort of do it on
different angles so this panel half and
half this panel half and half and then
of course the insides as well let the
show begin
so here's the test on my main air 7:40
and the top part since it's an outtake
it's there was really no dust to begin
with but they both did a good job the
front of the case they both did a really
good job to accept the data vac did
remove more dusts you can see down the
bottom here where the ebay banger was
blowing it there's still a little bit of
dust left in there so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to clean down the final
interior here of this case with the ebay
banger and then see the result and then
go over it with the data back and see
how much extra we can remove
but when we contrast the eBay banger to
the data vac what you're getting with
the banger is something that will do a
pretty good job of cleaning I mean it
does get out a lot of dust
except what it doesn't do is it doesn't
give you that final touch so if you're a
PC parts hustler II you're just building
a lot of computers or even if you love
your PC build you don't want to spend
like a day pulling out the dust filters
especially like on the air 7:40 then
something like the data vac will give
you that final touch it will remove all
the visible dusts and so the last final
touch you have to do is just give it a
layer of wd-40 which is what we're going
to do now
there it is there after copping
multiple hits with the blowers and then
getting a wd-40 clean it is looking
really good something like this if you
didn't have to record and film like I
did something that this would honestly
take you ten minutes tops and the
results speak for themselves your
computer is now looking really damn
clean with minimal effort but of course
there is one more test to do and that is
the raw power versus raw power on these
two puppies here so let's do it
so we saw there with the blocks of wood
this one managed to push over three
blocks of wood and this one managed to
push over two blocks of wood it almost
got the third so this one would have a
little bit more power than the red one
of course it's not four times the amount
of powers the price but there's one
final test left to do and that is the
hairdryer test
laughter but you know the will just
come to a stop
so in conclusion both will do a mighty
fine job of cleaning out computer parts
and also giving you a new hairdo as well
so but ultimately what we've got is one
that does a pretty good job for
twenty-five dollars and one that does a
really good job for ninety-three dollars
or if you're in Australia thirty-five
Australian dollars for a hundred and
fifty strangles but really when it comes
down to it it depends on how much you're
cleaning your PC parts if you're going
to be using this thing day in day out
then I would recommend using the data
vac and spending the extra money but if
you're in the cleaning your PC
occasionally then the $25.00 job is
gonna do a pretty good job of - it's
just that final touch for me personally
when I'm cleaning machines it means that
I'll have to use less brake clean and
now because this stuff's in Australia
it's pretty expensive in Japan it was
really cheap it was about dollar fifty a
can industry it's like literally six
five or six dollars a can so it's gonna
be able to save a bit of brake cleaner
of course I will still need my brake
clean and when it comes to things like
cleaning out GPU dies taking off
Northbridge heat sinks and then cleaning
the dirty heat sinks behind there and
also getting in really sort of
in-between capacitors and cleaning out
dust in there brake clean is still going
to be very useful for that and of course
that wd-40 that's going to be giving
your price and you look shine so this is
ultimately another tool in my sonal that
is going to be very valuable for getting
you guys those used potatoes and making
it look like they're new so if you guys
enjoyed today's video then be sure to
hit that like button and let me know in
the comment section below
have you tried either of these products
before if so what did you think I'll put
the links in the description below for
you guys and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
bye
giving you a new hairdo as well so what
we've got ultimately but what we've got
I'm vigilant
