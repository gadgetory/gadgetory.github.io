one of the best years for the CPU market
Rison has entered with the rising v 1600
and Verizon 7 1750 News which have
offered incredible value for money and
now they're also going to release the
rise of free CPUs and also their rise of
90 views which are again going to bring
even more value for money for the table
but on the other hand what have intel
been doing they seem to be going
backwards in some ways so today we're
going to discuss all these things
welcome back to tech yes it is Brian
coming to you guys today with a video
about CPUs and I just checked my email
the other day and there was a big
announcement from AMD they're going to
release the rise and three CPUs which
are River to come in at 109 dollars for
the four core risin three 1200 and also
129 dollars to the rosen 3 1,300 X now
both these CPUs will include coolers and
they'll also be overclockable too so the
G 4560 will now have some serious
competition and that's one of the only
few CDs I like from Intel however in
America at the moment I believe that CPU
is actually above its retail price in
Australia can currently pick this up to
77 Australian dollars which in Triple P
terms makes it $60 u.s. after-tax which
is still a really good buy however a
four call for $110 is definitely going
to bring some good competition to the
market now another huge announcement
from AMD was their rise in nine CPUs
they are now - skews one being the 16
core 32 threaded Rison 9 1950 X now this
is coming in at $1,000 and again it
performs amazing from what we've seen so
far over 3,000 points in Cinebench so
for you guys that need the performance
from multi-threaded CPUs this thing is
definitely going to deliver and then
they've got the 1920 X which is a 12
core 24 threaded CPU coming in at $799
from what we've seen so far out of the
box it performs over the Cinebench score
over 2400 points although both these
CPUs will be overclockable however me
personally I am waiting for the
announcement for the non X CPUs as we
saw with the rise in CPUs the non AK
CPUs give you the best bang for buck
since they are overclockable and they do
come in cheaper then the experience
I'm really curious to see what the
12-core non-experienced will be my guess
is around $700 for a 12 quart 24
threaded processor going to be insanely
good performance for the dollar now with
the rise in nine CPUs they're going to
use a new chipset name of do the X 399
now this difference from the risin 7 and
that it has four thousand and ninety
four pins so it's an absolute monster in
terms of size also on the x3 99 chipset
you get quad channel memory now I'm
actually curious to see this and how it
will pan out in actual games as we know
that the dual channel memory and also
single channel versus dual channel on
the rise and seven CPUs does affect
gaming performance so I'd like to see
how Joule Channel versus quad channel
affects gaming performance also now
another really good thing that's coming
with riser 9 is 64 PCIe Lane so it's
Rison 7 you only got 16 PCIe length
native to the CPU and also eight on the
chipset however this time was rather 9
you're getting 64 now this comes from
them using 2 Zeppelin dies and 1
Zeppelin die has 2 CCX modules which is
what Rison users however I believe this
time with the Zeppelin dies on rather 9
they're fully enable in terms of PCIe
length hence why you get 64 so what does
this mean for the current state of the
CPU market well in my opinion it is so
damn good in 2017 I believe we've
actually never had it better than we've
had it this year competition is finally
back prices are good and what this means
is that you guys the end consumer end up
winning in terms of value for money
risin 7 and risin 5 have brought
exceptional value for money for the
table and they've also fourth Intel to
drop the prices of their flagships for
instance let's look at the 69 50 X which
cost $1,700 now the 7900 x which is the
same part but newer is now costing
$1,000 though on that note of Intel
however they seem to be taking a stab at
AMD as well saying that their CPUs are
simply glued together and I believe
that's not the correct statement I
believe AMD in ways with Verizon are
innovating for the future the Infinity
fabric seems to be the way going forward
if we look at for example in historical
terms we had one call going to two cause
it now makes logical sense to go from
one data to die and learn how to
efficiently connect them and I know that
is what AMD is doing with Rison if we
look at the 16 and 12
all components that they've shown the
benchmarks for they look like they're
scaling near-perfect in comparison to
the risin 5 &amp;amp; 7 CPUs so now guys let me
know in the comment section below what
you think of the current state of the
CPU market and also let me know your
favorite picks for CPUs currently if I
had to pick a few CPUs my favorite would
be the rising 5 1600 at the moment
couple that with the GP 350 motherboard
and you have such power for such good
money and also the G 45 60 would
probably come in second place if you can
pick it up for retail really good if
you're on a budget you just want an
entry-level graphics card and of course
the Rison v 1400 and risin 7 1700 a
really good value for money too
then you've got the 7700 k if you want
absolute performance in games or if
you're a competitive gamer and you need
the best FPS available I know guys if
you enjoyed today's video to be sure to
hit that like button and also maybe
subscribe if you want to get the latest
tech news from tech yes City and also
don't forget to hit that notification
bell if you want the videos as soon as
possible
delivered to your inbox and also what
about X 399 pricing on the motherboard I
believe they will come in and over
around $200 similar to X 299 maybe a
little bit cheaper because I believe AMD
won't charge is my true next 399 license
as opposed to Intel but expect them to
be around $200 as all those components
that they've put on those motherboards
don't come cheap especially a four
thousand and ninety four pin socket and
as always I'll catch you in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
