demonstration of the k68 keyboard which
just has water plummeting all over the
keys and it is still working at
perfectly fine now they have this in two
different flavours blue backlighting
with blue cherry MX switches and red
lighting with Cherry MX
red switches and that's also the design
for this keyboard came from the fact
that a lot of Asian web cafes had people
just spilling coffees and spilling
drinks all over the keyboard and instead
of having to go fix those keyboards they
can then just clean the keyboard and
they will still work and they'll be
ready to go rather than that web cafe
spending lots of money to replace it
2017 Computex coverage for tech yes City
was brought to you by MSI and Corsair
for a limited time only you can get a
free copy of Ghost Recon wildlands luxe
Edition with any purchase of an MSI
product click the link in description
below to find out more so now we're at
the arguably the most interesting thing
on the peripheral side of things this is
concepts Zeus I am joined by Chris Smith
emo how you doing man yeah really good
thanks yourself yeah pretty good I'm
loving Computex and I'm actually loving
this concept zoo so tell me a little bit
more about it what's its features and
who's it going to target so it concept
Zeus is a completely new thing to us a
lot of people have asked us to show to
the public a little bit more about what
we're working on instead of just saying
hey we came out with is awesome k95
keyboard or hey we've already released
this case we're saying this is what
we're looking to do in the future
unlike a lot of other say car
manufacturers we're sharing concepts
that are a reality and not concepts that
are just to get people excited so
basically what happens here with the
concept Zeus is it's a wireless mouse as
well as it's a mousepad that can charge
it through Qi charging which is Qi
charging so you can essentially instead
of having to worry about changing the
batteries on your mouse you just put it
on this little zone on the mouse pad and
then it's all charged ready to go for
the next time you're gaming yeah yeah
exactly so it means that you know if
you're if you're going to a toilet going
to make a mad feed where you're in a big
gaming session or someone comes to the
door everyone everyone loves a man food
run
everyone loves the mad feed you can just
check the mouse right up to the top and
then it can just start charging while
you're gone and then you can come back
or you know most motherboards these days
have USB ports that work when the PC is
off so you can just move the mouse to
the top it's always charging but if
you're really worried it comes with
micro USB on it anyway so you can charge
like that - you got a mouse there with
expandability on the mousepad and also
the mouse has a lot of features where
you can implement macros but at the
moment it's still very early in the
concept so there's actually no official
word on release date pricing or even
what sense is going in this mouse here
yeah basically you know the list of
information so far is that it's a Qi
charging thing with a mouse and a mouse
pad it can charge your phone as well at
the same time it comes with a dongle
that you can plug in to your iPhone and
you also use that to charge if you have
an Android that isn't Qi charging
capable you can plug the dongle into
that as well is we're going to have
about seven side buttons on the noun so
it's going to light up because it's
course it's going to be software
compatible because it's corsair but
besides that there's not too much more
information we're looking at a release
date of the second half of this year but
there's a possibility we'll run into the
start of next year as well okay well I
was just keen to check out some of those
unrealistic concepts as well you never
know
they are pretty fancy yeah they're
pretty fancy anyway guys thanks Chris
for coming over for the booth and
Jonah's concept zeus and let us know in
the comments section guys what do you
think of this I actually tested it out
and I think it's really cool I could use
something like this since I do want to
get a wireless mouse except I always
have that problem where it runs out of
batteries so this thing will definitely
solve that problem for me so also in the
peripheral zone is the Corsair glaive
which has been recently released to
market and the coolest thing about this
mouse is you can change it to three
different variants with the side control
there so you've got a textured side a
non textured side which is a little bit
wider and also a non textured side which
is the same as the original which was
textured and also on that note it is a
palm grippers Mouse so it does have a
pretty big feel to it so if you are into
mice like the Death Adder all the other
variants from Logitech by the G 400 then
this Mouse is definitely cool you have
the RGB lighting really good picsArt
sensor in here and not only that you can
also use the synced software and I have
tested the input lag on Corsair mice and
there
pretty much just as good as Logitech
mice so if you are into pro gaming then
this thing is really customizable it
feels really good the clicks all-around
feel exceptionally good too so I can see
why the glaive is doing really well
already and I'm trying it out firsthand
I'm really liking it so far anyway guys
that's it for the Corsair boost for 2017
we just finished covering the
peripherals and I thought that concept
zeus that was something that i could
definitely use in my life and get rid of
the wide option even though it does have
the option to wire it up and plug it up
anyway I'll catch you guys in another
tech video very soon for Computex 2017
and peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
