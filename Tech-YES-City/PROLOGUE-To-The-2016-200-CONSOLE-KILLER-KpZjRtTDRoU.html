$200 for a used PC and hopefully this
thing will be able to destroy this ps4
that I have here like not literally
destroy it like just faded into
benchmarks first things first let's
detail what parts we have here today and
how much each component costs and then
I'm going to do a little bit of cleaning
and bring all these parts up to Brandon
you starting from left to right on the
parts we have the CPU RAM and
motherboard which came in a set for 82
dollars shipped roughly and it features
8 gigabytes of ddr3 memory and i-5 754
core and also in a Zeus p7p 55 de
motherboard to the right of that we have
an r7 270 from XFX which I managed to
pick up for $97 and then just below that
we have a 500 gigabyte Western Digital
black enterprise storage hard drive
which I got also for $11 shipped to the
right of that we have a Sith core there
which I managed to pick up a while ago
for about $10 and then above that we
have an antic 650 watt power supply
which I picked up for $14 shipped off
the internet and then just behind that I
have the final component which is the
case where I picked that up for two
dollars down the junk store so that
leaves the total price of all these
parts to around two hundred and fifteen
dollars also keep in mind I do not know
yet if all the parts are fully
functional so let's give this a good
cleansing and then we're going to test
the parts and see if they all work
I sit on to the moment of truth just to
see if the parts are working and
everything's okay so we're just going to
fire it up turn the power supply on and
something interesting about this power
supply is it does not have any molex or
Saito connectors on it so I'm kind of
like really surprised about what's going
on here so um you know hopefully we get
a signal and that's all we're really
looking for here is because I know the
graphics card works as well I already
tested that and made a tweet about it
trying another power supply now and I
know it's not the power supply now so I
know it's not the graphics card either
because I've tested that so we're going
to do is we're going to use our $100 PC
that we built before and since it's the
same platform I can switch the CPU and
the motherboard and also the RAM so
we're going to get to the bottom of this
actually pretty quickly now first order
of business is just to test out the
memory in there and as you can see here
it's working eh okay it's actually
working really well so let's try and
test out some other parts
so we started the CPU up and I don't
know if you guys can hear the fans just
going at full speed so I think we have
another day five like wow what is it to
i5s now that are bricked like what
what's the what is it with Japan and
selling dotted I fiefs
I don't get it okay so we've got the
motherboard now working with the i3 so
this is really good news at least we
didn't get completely hosed in this deal
however as we saw before we've got
another brick died five so I really
don't know what's going on there but we
can enter setup here and we can see that
the hard drive is also being detected
as well so really good news on that
front
at least we've got something that's
working now so I'm going to have to yeah
pretty much order another CPU N and
we're going to move on to conclusion for
this first part okay so i've just sanded
back the pins on the bottom or the pads
on the bottom here a little bit so i'm
gonna see if that helps I mean I will
give it one more try because you know
that can sometimes be a problem so we're
going to try and put this back in and
see if it fires up again and so we're
going to give it one more try and if not
this CPU is definitely buggered so I
mean I've cleaned the contact pads it's
the only thing I can really do with this
bad boy so we are going to give it one
more try and hopefully we can get
something out of it this time
I'm just going to check the yeah like I
mean this time around like there's some
CPU LED light coming on on the
motherboard so you know the CPU is just
it's bricked so we can't really do much
about that so I'm gonna have to order in
another CPU
you
so to conclude what happened to
we have another brick cpu so now I've
got two i5 750 s around here that don't
work
I even tried repairing the first one
that I had with a circuit tracer and
unfortunately I mean at least I learned
that that doesn't replace an SMD
resistor at least in the cpu that I was
trying to fix today and I mean that was
five of them that was missing on that
CPU so I'm not surprised that that
didn't work however the biggest problem
I have with today's build is that the
guy in the auction that I bought it off
pacifically said that he had pulled this
motherboard CPU Ram off a working build
and I seriously do not know how a CPU
gets damaged before a motherboard in
shipping or whatnot so it sounds like a
load of crap to me I'm pretty frustrated
about that it's mainly the time thing
and all the messing around to diagnose
this sees that the CPU doesn't work
that's the biggest thing you know it's
not like okay I lost $20 it's not the
end of the world for me but you know I
will try contacting him and seeing what
he says and I will get back to you guys
on Twitter or whatnot and let you guys
know what happened there however this is
the pre log I'm going to make this
instead of a two part series I'm going
to make this a pre log to the console
killer because at least all the other
parts are confirmed working which is
great news and all they need to do is
now is getting a working CPU which will
add cost to the build so I'm expecting
this to be around a $250 console killer
now instead of a $200 but that's what
happens when you go use you do run those
risks even though it's in this case it's
kind of like I got shafted or hosed a
little bit so but I am glad that the
motherboard and the RAM work at least
that's two good things that came out of
that seller if the motherboard was
bricked you would have heard me
you know cursing from here to your house
and I'm all the way in Japan so anyway
guys that's about it for today if you
like this video please give it a thumbs
up if you have any questions or comments
about the console killer in the making
then drop a comment in common
and below and I'll get back to you as
soon as I can and I will catch you guys
in another tech video very soon peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
