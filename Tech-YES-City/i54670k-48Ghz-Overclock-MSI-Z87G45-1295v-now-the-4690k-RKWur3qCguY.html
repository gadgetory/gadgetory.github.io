Barone's you coming back to you guys
today with a quick look at the msi UEFI
BIOS and also a quick 4.8 gigahertz
overclock now i've only had this for
about an hour and like I've only been
tweaking the overclocks for about an
hour and a bit and I've managed to get
up to four point eight gigahertz which
is very impressive the diminishing
returns seriously kicks in after 4.6
gigahertz so 4.6 karats is looking like
the new 4.2 that Ivy Bridge was like a
24/7 super safe overclock 4.6 looks like
that new super safe overclock now the
voltage here is it set at one point two
nine five so you guys are welcome to
copy my settings
I still have with MSI BIOS you there's a
lot of features a lot of options that
it's really intricate is really detailed
it's really in-depth I like the BIOS the
more I use it the more I start to get
used to it it's really good now don't be
afraid this CPU temperature is correct
yes 65 degrees however you got to
remember that when I first booted this
up and went into BIOS even at 3 point 4
gigahertz
it was reading 50 degrees so it tends to
run hot in I don't know in BIOS for some
reason so that's something to consider
but when you benchmark it stress test
with the stress testing it goes up to
about 80 at this speeds I did try to go
to 5 gigahertz but that was just yeah I
mean that's getting into the danger zone
I need a lot more time to stuff around
with that but yeah you can see how I'm
going to actually get in I got to
research more of these settings and find
out what's a lot more of these mean but
just setting this to one point two nine
five and everything else on auto it
seems to be as stable at the moment at
four point eight Giga so let's just
click exit that and save configuration
and let's move on in to mister Windows
and we'll quickly do a stress test and
show you guys so yeah this is a four
point eight Gertz let's move on to a
quick stress test for you guys and show
you what our little baby beast is
capable of little baby beast so come on
mister has well mister haps well I'm
bench dude I'm really tired
I'm really tired so I need to get to bed
so we'll quickly do this quickly system
stability test in i-264 so I just was
really good you know I'll be going
in-depth a lot more in depth soon so you
want to go over here and go to sensor
you want to see what everything's
running cpuid let's just confirm this
4.8 gigs here it is here whoo
so it's a little nice little puppy so
for cause a 4.8 gigs this thing is a
stable little beast so here we go here
it gets up to about 80 something degrees
at 4.8 gigs so it is um it is yeah so it
is good it's a it's better than Ivy
Bridge for overclocking so it's looking
good it's looking kind of like Sandy at
the moment looking similar in that kind
of ballpark so anyway guys I hope you
enjoyed this quick overclock I'll get
some more overclocks done in the next
few days but here's a 4.8 gig 'it's if
you guys liked this video please give it
a thumbs up and also if you have any
questions or comments please leave come
in the comment section below and I'll
get back to you as soon as I can and if
you have an array subscribe to tech yes
city where everybody here is a yes man
it has peace out for now Bron easy bite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
