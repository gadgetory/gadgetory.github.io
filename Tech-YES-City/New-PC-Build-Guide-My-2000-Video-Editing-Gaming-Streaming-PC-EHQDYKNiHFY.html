welcome by the tech city this is Brian
and I hope you are all having a great
day and if not then hopefully this video
will make your day great and just a
second let me open
okay so that's much better and today
we're going with an all-new PC that
costs around two thousand USD or three
thousand AUD to build but will
definitely kick the pants out of gaming
streaming productivity and video editing
though this time around let's talk about
what parts we are putting in the build
then we'll quickly build this big chunk
of thunder tune it and then run some
benchmarks now straight away off the
get-go when going with a new PC you're
not going to get the price performance
levels that you're going to get with
that of a full-on used parts build but
that being said you will have or at
least should have absolutely no hassles
involved you also get lengthy warranties
everything is clean and you won't need
to clean or replace anything yourself
which can save a lot of time and
everything comes with an easy to follow
instructions so there in general there's
way less risk involved as opposed to
going use not to mention everything is
supported in the latest drivers - and
also customer support is there to help
you through troubleshooting ok so now
for a breakdown of the pot so we went
with cooler masters latest mastercase 5
which is their mid tower ATX case that
actually supports extended ATX
motherboards then for the mobile itself
we have an msi x99s big carbon gaming
Pro n i7 6800 K which is cooled by a
cooler master Sadin 240 all-in-one the
RAM is a paces Panther memory 32gb bake
it though if you are like me and you are
editing lots of 4k video footage then
you may wish to add in another 32
gigabytes of this stuff for the graphics
card we have an msi gtx 1070 gaming z
ebay red black sleeve cables Western
Digital 3 terabyte blue for backup and
an a piece of one terabyte for the main
OS Drive in gaming also another option
is to have an nvme Drive the one I have
here is an a piece of 480 gigabyte PCIe
m2 which I can use as my scratch drive
for Premiere Pro lastly all this is
powered by the cooler master g7 50 M
semi modular power supply and this build
tallied up to around 1979 USD or three
thousand and five Australian dollars
also in this case I replaced the fans
with jet flow red LED lit fans from
coolermaster actually four of these and
also got the clear side panel for this
case to show off my one 3-3-7 hardware
so these options did cost a little more
but they aren't really needed
so finally after setting up the PC it
was time to boot it up and test it out
and see how well it performs in games
the OS used is Windows 10 Pro 64-bit
which can still be upgraded from a cheap
copy of 8.1 pro as for overclocking this
beast I managed to get it to 4.2 Giga at
one point three one volt Broadwell II
x99 CPUs are renowned for being lazy
overclockers and this certainly wasn't
an exception the graphs card however was
screaming past two gigahertz even with
out-of-the-box settings which made this
great for playing the latest demanding
titles at even 4k on high settings here
are some benchmarks for you guys
in my shoe
damn there we have it 4k gaming this
thing can do it though not max ultra
settings I can still get high out of a
lot of the settings and it was a very
smooth and awesome experience really
satisfying as for editing videos on what
is to become my main PC is simply bliss
although some people say you only need
32 gigabytes of RAM I found myself
coming into memory areas when editing
large videos with over 100 gigabytes of
footage putting an extra 32 gigabytes of
memory solve this problem and editing
with an nvme m2 PCIe drive was a smooth
experience for productivity and both
saving time this is definitely going to
be something a small business might want
to look at the last part of the
performance with this build is the noise
and temp levels now they can not over
call it really well but the noise levels
on idle will whisper quiet which can be
tuned from the MSI motherboard itself
and on load the temperatures were very
well controlled with noise creeping up a
little bit but still then not even
anywhere near annoying and finally
moving on to the cooler master master
case 5 which was sent out as a review
sample and what can be said about it
well firstly I enjoyed building in this
case everything was so pleasant and well
thought-out the cable management the
back was fantastic installing fans on
the front had nice options fitting up to
3 140 millimeter fans the options for
ads can also fit a 120 millimeter on the
back a 240 mil on top and a 360 mil with
dust filters extending to the top front
and bottom I did find at the top however
I could only screw off the rad at only
six of the eight points that the
radiator had support for and I had to
remove the dust filter to do so moving
on to the front input/output panel there
are two USB 3 connections audio in and
out hard disk drive light reset and
power buttons behind that was 2 handles
with plastic armor that was just coming
off which kind of confused me since I
would have loved the option to have just
removed the handles completely for a
cleaner look then there is the option
four to five and a quarter inch drive
bays at the top below that two three and
a half inch hard disk drive drive mounts
which slide out and then on the bottom
inside there is room for two more two
and a half inch drives that just sit in
front of the motherboard below that is
the semi enclosed bottom of the case
where there's
room for an additional two and a half
inch drive and also besides that there
is the mount for the power supply which
has some soft supports there for easy
mounting a bottom facing mounted power
supply is standard here and the two feet
below that have strong rubberized grips
that are some of the most rigid I have
ever seen welcomed with the cabling in
the mice case five was also extremely
good dare I say this is the best case
I've ever had in terms of workflow this
thing was just so damn easy to move in
screws fit first go there was no sharp
edges cable management spacing was
generous with so many places to zip tie
off to included accessories and screws
were also more than generous this in my
opinion was the standout feature of the
MAS case 5 that is the flexibility solid
construction and eserve room to work
with the final look is very clean as
well you guys that's it for my new 4k
video editing gaming / streaming PC hope
you guys enjoyed this video and if you
did then be sure to suplex that like
button and let me know in the comments
section below
have you tried video editing before if
so what program do you use and if you
just want to say something else then go
at it I love reading the comments
section as always and I'll catch you
guys in the next Tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
