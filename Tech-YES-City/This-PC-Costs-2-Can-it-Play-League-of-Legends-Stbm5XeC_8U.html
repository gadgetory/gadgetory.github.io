actually you can get a Snickers you get
a Powerade or you can get a copy of Just
Dance for the Wii or even a copy of big
mother truckers to truck me harder well
you could get yourself a dusty old PC
that could possibly play league of
legends this PC right beside me here we
picked it up in one of 15 pcs that we
got for $30 I'll put the video up here
if you haven't seen it already but
essentially this one had a graphics card
and a hard drive and it's dirty and old
so we're gonna give it some tech yes
loving that is just clean it up and then
boot it up install windows unactivated
and then see if it indeed will be out of
play League of Legends let's go on this
journey we're gonna pull this PC apart
now we've got our trusty data vac on top
some alcohol wipes if we need to clean
off the dirt and to give it a new look
shine we've got some water dispersant so
let's make it brand new
I know you may have heard once in
another for the police Tek yes
give me more
get that wipe clap it in tight it's
gonna take you on a journey
don't do that to she names dawn you
heard my binds in the rx5 wd-40 so
finished cleaning up all the parts here
and the scariest one was probably the
greatest car which had hard thermal
paste on it and it's really important to
change this over because now I gravis
card won't overheat and it'll run fine
with this computer we've also managed to
pull out from another build an e 5400
Pentium dual core so we're to put that
inside here because that'll allow us to
have a higher clock speed and
essentially get more FPS in League of
Legends providing the gravis card is not
holding the build back we've also still
got to clean up the PC case to make
everything look as good as possible
hundred
so here we are now we're trying to get
it to boot and it just keeps giving us
problem after problem we've tried a hard
drive and print stalling on ID windows
on it doesn't work because it's buyers
only has a de andrade mode but the
problem is it just won't even boot it
won't even recognize the boot itself so
this is troublesome because it was all
ready to go it was looking good but
thankfully we have a ton of other pcs
here so we're gonna find a motherboard
that can actually boot and we'll
transplant that into this case because I
really want to see our play League of
Legends so we've now got this thing
booted up on the original hard drive
that we were using and the original
graphics card so it looks like it was
indeed that motherboard and stuff like
that that can happen because it may be
bit rot or just aged in general and
we'll talk about that later in the
conclusion but here we are here we've
got League of Legends it's finally
installing and I just can't wait to boot
it up and see if I too-tall a PC kind of
it's probably not $2.00 now but since we
are using different parts but
so now we're finally on this game
installed but there's just one big
problem and that's the game won't even
load like I've been stuck here on this
screen for probably almost ten minutes
now so I feel really sorry for my
teammates here even on the right
revolver he was like loading up a lot
slower than the others were but I was
seriously beating him by a longshot so
yeah I'm gonna try and get a game of
this booted up then we can see how much
FPS we're getting in the game but other
than that like $2 what are you doing to
me
all right so we've got to load it up
here and this is just so bad it's
probably I'd have to guess like 5 fps or
something like that it's ridiculous so
I'm guessing it could be the graphics
card since it was going from like 1 FPS
to 5 once we dropped it from medium
settings to high settings now I've got
one of these sitting around it's one of
graphics cards someone just threw it in
the past so as a last resort I'm gonna
try this card out and if all else fails
then I'm just gonna take this thing out
back along with the other 2 pcs that
didn't work properly and just start
feeding them
so we put in the Quadro and the exact
same things happening the FPS is just
super low we've even tried putting in
six gigabytes of RAM tried different
sticks of memory everything and the
Nvidia K 400 Quadro that should be more
than capable of running this game at
least at 720p 60fps so at this stage I'm
done let's move over to a conclusion
with this it's just been such a
frustrating day
so with that little interlude aside I
managed to salvage all the parts out of
the builds the screws the solder cables
the power supplies also the CPUs as for
the main boards they're really old and
that's the problem with LGA 775 itself
if you're going to go with this
architecture make sure you get something
like a zoo speed five cure something
that shouldn't have many compatibility
problems it shouldn't have any boot
issues and it should be able to take a
gigabytes of ddr2 and a new a quad core
you should be able to get decent
performance even in 2018 out of a build
like that but the builds we had here
today just wouldn't accept newer CPUs we
tried out a 2006 Core 2 Duo on the first
build and that wouldn't even boot even
with its original CPU and then we went
over to the next build and that was the
exact same motherboard and setup as the
first build and that managed to boot
this time around and we decided to put
in 6 gigabytes of RAM this time just to
let the game boot up and see if it would
work and so we got into Windows and it
only recognized 3.2 5 gigabytes of ddr2
and now I tried everything on these
first two builds tried clearing the CMOS
tried a new CMOS battery tried different
CPUs different memory and it just ended
up on the second build it just wouldn't
get past the load screen and we got
stuck at a hundred percent and also
apologized to the four other dudes out
there who I left out in the dark sorry
about that and after this I decided
we'll give it one more try I want to get
League of Legends working on one of
these old potatoes and so at this point
in time I think the build tallies up to
6 dollars and we've put in the graphics
card and this time around everything's
working 6 gigabytes of ddr2 is being
recognized the problem was in this bill
that would only accept a 2005 Core 2 Duo
we tried the one from 2006 which had the
higher clock speeds and it got into the
game and we got from literally from 1 to
5 FPS depending on the settings and now
we had it on low spec mode windows was
completely optimized 60 bytes of ddr2
was being recognized and we had on the
absolute lowest settings and we're
getting like 5 fps and then we tried I
said ok maybe it's a grep Scott tried
something else and it was still doing
the exact same thing and it's just so
frustrating this is why
generally don't like to touch the older
stuff where things should technically
work but they don't as opposed to the
original five-dollar League of Legends
PC this one today clearly failed the
original one was so good I really
enjoyed that we actually got a smooth
playable experience out of it at least
on League of Legends and this one today
we just completely failed wouldn't even
play League of Legends I mean it might
be out of play solitaire or something
like that but I don't think many people
are in the market for a solitaire gaming
PC but all that aside I hope you enjoyed
today's video if you did then be sure to
hit that like button also let us know in
the comments section below what is the
most frustrating experience you've had
with tech love reading your thoughts and
opinions as always and also let us know
what you think of the $2 PC I mean the
concept was good the build looked
awesome I gave it a lot of tech yes
loving but in the end it just didn't
work out and yeah don't ask me in the
future to touch LGA 775 I'm kind of I
just I'm done with it because even the
first gen I series it I just never get
anywhere near the amount of problems
that I do with LGA 775 so I'm not doing
this to myself anymore maybe a p5q or
something like that maybe but other than
that I'll catch you in another tech
video very soon these out for now
bye and looking back in hindsight I much
prefer these Snickers the Powerade big
mother truckers all we danced over this
two-dollar PC here today unfortunately
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
