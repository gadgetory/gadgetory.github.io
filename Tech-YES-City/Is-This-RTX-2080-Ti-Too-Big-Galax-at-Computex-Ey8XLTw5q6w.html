booth for Computex 2019
and there are a few
new cards in the works,
as well as a few cards
that I've never seen before
that have been sold in the Chinese market.
And we're gonna take a look at those
after we take a look at the
2080 Ti Hall of Fame Platinum.
This is a 10 year
anniversary graphics card
that honestly combines
the best of all worlds.
You've got a massive air cooler,
but underneath that
you've got a massive custom
water cooling solution
so three eight pin
solutions this will need
in order to keep this beast powered
But on that note, it does
have a bit of RGB bling
on both the front and back.
You've got those three
fans just doing a great job
of keeping this thing super cool
but this will be the flagship of flagships
and it is due to release
right around Rizen 3000 series time.
So they basically timed it
with all those high-end motherboards
that you're seeing coming out.
So if someone wants to
get the best of the best,
then they're definitely gonna want to get
a 2080 Ti Hall of Fame
Platinum from GALAX.
Now in terms of pricing,
they haven't told me a price yet,
but you can expect it to come
in maybe a little bit more expensive
than the current Hall of Fame 2080 Ti.
But in terms of getting a sample of tech,
YesCity I probably don't think
that's going to happen.
There is only a limited run of these cards
and they haven't confirmed
how many just yet.
But right above that is
the O.C. Labs edition
which was actually never
sold to the public.
And that had a special
vbios for LN2 competition.
If you guys haven't seen the GALAX
overclocking tournament I did last year,
ill put the link up here.
But that was absolutely insane,
but some of these cards
coming out of GALAX
really do open the eye
and that's exactly what we are going to do
after the intro.
(upbeat music)
So here beside me, we have a GPU
that's currently being sold in China,
and GALAX is sort of
testing the market to see
if a style like this
is going to work well.
And when I first saw it, it stood out.
I absolutely loved it.
This is metal master RTX2070.
Now, I'm only told this
series and this style
is only for the 2070,
but I am absolutely loving the light blue.
I think its different than
any other graphics card
I've seen out there on the market,
and, of course, it doesn't break the bank.
Now it is coming in at MSRP over in China
and it does have white LEDs and
of course, that light blue aesthetic.
Man, I'm really diggin it though.
Let us know in the comment section below
what you guys think of these designs,
and would you ike to see
them released in Europe,
America, Australia?
GALAX always loves getting
feedback from you guys.
Me personally I've been,
uh, ever since I've seen it here today,
Here to my right is another card
that is being currently tested
in the Chinese market, and
this is the game series.
Ranging from the RTX2060 2070 to the 2080.
And it sort of the same concept.
A different look.
Some of the looks that
you aren't used to getting
in Australia and Europe, but let us know
in the comment section below too.
Are you diggin this style?
But speaking of this style,
they do have a ESPORTS design in the works
which does sort of take
some of these elements
with that darker themed aesthetic,
but also adding in a
bit of RGB a backplate.
And its really for gamers to customize
the lighting on their system.
Whether it be to your GPU temperatures
when things get hot,
or you can customize it to music.
Just sort of giving that,
I guess, aesthetic feel.
And, of course, tagging
it under the gamer logo.
Now, right behind me is two new SSDs
one which hasn't come to market yet.
Its still in production
in terms of a release date.
They actually aren't decided, and in terms
of a pricing too.
This is the E16 NVME Hall of Fame drive.
As for the speeds though,
they have got a model here
and they have tested it out, and
we're looking at speeds that go up to
on the read sides, 4800
Megabytes per second.
On the write sides, up to
4000 megabytes per second.
Now you will need PCie Gen 4.0
and this is a 4x4 solution
so it will work on those X570 motherboards
that are to be released
in July on the seventh.
But, speaking of another product
that is currently release in China
but being released to
the rest of the world
and GALAX wants some feedback
is the Hall of Fame Pcie slot-in SSD.
Now this thing is really fast.
Going up to 3400 Megabytes per second.
3000 on the writes,
but in terms of it flavors,
you got a one terabyte and two terabyte
as well as having that
gold and white aesthetic
matching the Hall of Fame series,
and a bit of RGB bling,
lighting up the side.
And that's about it for GALAX here
at Computex 2019.
I hope you guys enjoyed this video.
If you did, then be sure
to hit that like button
for us. Also,
let us know in the comments section below
what was your favorite product here
on display at GALAX booth.
They do love the feedback too,
so make sure you comment below.
Let them know what you
think about their products.
I know a lot of you guys in America
want to see more GALAX
flowing through to the US.
That is something, me personally,
that I'm telling GALAX all the time.
You got to get more of these cards
available in the US,
For the boys over there.
But, I am relaying that.
But other than that,
let us know about these stalls guys
and I hope you enjoy this one.
If you are enjoying the Computex coverage
then be sure to hit that sub button.
Hit that bell to get the videos
as soon as they drop, and ill catch you
in another tech video very soon.
Peace out for now.
