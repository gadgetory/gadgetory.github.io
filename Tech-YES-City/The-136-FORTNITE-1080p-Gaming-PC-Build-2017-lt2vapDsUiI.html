you've got and today we have only a
hundred and thirty six dollars and we're
certainly going to be making do in
titles like fortnight which is a
recently released free-to-play game
that's similar to pub G so we'll be
testing that out and also pub G and also
destiny to to see how far we can stretch
this one hundred and thirty-six dollars
welcome back to tech yes City this is
brand coming to you guys are there with
a PC that really just hits all the marks
in terms of price performance we've got
a budget CPU the x34 30 this thing comes
in at seven dollars and it's that good
for the money that I might give it a
dedicated video on its own so stay tuned
for that and then for the cooler we're
using a four dollar sis Kabuto now this
thing is extremely cheap but it didn't
come with a mounting installation kit
hence why it was so cheap however I did
manage to get around this and I did make
a separate video which I'll put in the
description below where I used silicon
bond and glued it down to the actual
motherboard and CPU and the temperatures
were actually okay so for this CPU and
cooler combo we're putting it on a H 55
M motherboard now picked this up in
Thailand in a recent used parts on and I
got it for around about $30 very cheap
when you couple it with the CPU and then
we move on to the memory we've got this
for $25 two sticks of xbg data memory
well actually got it for free but I'm
just pricing it up on what would you
expect to pay for a gigabytes of ddr3
memory now it is to stick so we'll run
in dual channel and it does overclock
quite well even to 1600 megahertz on the
X and P profiles and for graphics we own
with a HD 7870 now I picked this up for
$45 and although it is quite old in
terms of its age it's actually really
good still in terms of its performance
and we'll find that out a little bit
later and then continuing on this trend
of extreme budget we've got a cooler and
power supply both Coolermaster for $20
now the power supply is a 500 watt power
supply and it does have around about 400
watts available on the 12 volt line
which is gonna be plenty enough for
today's components even when we
overclock both the CPU and the graphics
card to higher levels and then lastly
for the drives were going with their
really odd configuration to 160 gigabyte
hard drives I did try to raid 0 room but
the motherboard that we have doesn't
support raid 0 so we're just going to
install windows on one then of course
we've got an extra 160 gigabytes to play
around with now I did pull these hard
drives out of pcs that people didn't
want anymore so I technically paid
nothing for them but honestly if you're
looking for hard drives this old and
banged up I wouldn't pay any more than
$5 the only way that brings the total of
this bill to a hundred and thirty six US
dollars or if you're in Australia about
a hundred
eighty Australian dollars that without
any further ado let's put this thing
together
for the overclocks the graphics card did
extremely well we've got 1200 and 20
megahertz on the core and we've got an
extra 200 megahertz out of the memory
which is effectively quad pumped
so it'd be around an extra 800 megahertz
effective on the gddr5 and now this will
allow it to perform pretty well in games
the fire strike score is scoring close
to that of a GTX 1050 or if not a little
bit better I believe and so that's going
to equate really well in terms of gaming
performance especially for a $45 grabs
card now when it came to the CPU the X
34:30 this thing comes out of the box at
2.5 3 gigahertz we managed to get it to
3.6 gigahertz on this $4 cooler and this
really inexpensive $30 motherboard now
keep in mind I could get it up to 3.8
gigahertz but I'm just not comfortable
with running something that's got a real
entry-level vrm at higher temperatures
and putting more stress on that vrm as
when I tested it with an IR gun the
MOSFETs were reading about 68 degrees
which of course t-junction levels would
be a lot hotter than that or at least a
little bit hotter and so I'm not
comfortable running my vrm with that
extra level of stress because it could
mean in the long run a blown-out
motherboard versus one that doesn't blow
out of course that big question remains
how does it performing games let's take
a quick look
so the first game which was the whole
reason for today's PC that is for
tonight this ran extremely well on this
PC we're getting around 50 to 70 FPS
most of the times on medium graphical
settings and the lowest view distance
possible when I did up the view distance
however there was some quite nasty
stuttering so for these settings this
computer did run quite well there was
the occasional stutter so I'm not sure
if that's the hardware itself or it's
just those two really old hard drives
that I'm using and especially with
background processes going on with
windows that can indeed cause stuttering
due to those old hard drives though the
next game we had was pub G and I was
surprised this actually ran really well
at 1080p on very low settings we're
getting around 50 to 60 fps but it was
good to see that this PC for a hundred
and thirty six dollars could run this
game and run it really well I did have
an enjoyable experience and then we had
the last game which I'll pull up for you
guys
destiny - that was running again around
70 FPS at 1080p on a blend of low and
high settings and it was really gorgeous
to play even on these settings so
ultimately all three games here at 1080p
works success they were running really
well though if I had a little bit of
extra money and had to change things
around which I probably will then I
would use a normal cooler not a glued
down cooler because I think I'm gonna
sell this PC and if I do then I
definitely don't want to sell someone a
silicon bonded CPU to CPU cooler they'll
probably look at anything like what is
going on here so I'll probably replace
the cooler with something with a
mounting kit though if it was using it
for me personally I would keep the glued
down cooler on there because it's all
about price performance at the end of
the day and you're saving a lot of money
with something like this though also the
other thing I'd do is probably change
the hard drive around even for a single
500 gigabyte hard drive that's used bits
a couple of years you are then those two
old hard drives as they are really slow
and they are really sluggish but on that
note what about the overclocks the last
thing to talk about in today's video
they were extremely good I mean the x30
430 again I'll probably be doing a
dedicate
a video to that CPU because it's seven
dollars seven dollars
the price performance especially in
games that you're gonna get with other
CPUs even one of my favorites the ex
5650 in terms of just the CPU alone I
don't think it's gonna come close to
this thing because you're usually
getting a couple a CPU like this with a
medium in graphics card like a GTX 780
at best and you're gonna get really good
price performance so I will be taking a
closer look at that CPU and also the
graphics card the 7870 it still goes
really hard I did manage to do a
temperature test on the graphics cards
at 80% fan speeds which isn't that loud
on this GPU and the temperatures hit 62
degrees max in a 27 degree ambient
environment so the over clocks were
really impressive the temperatures were
good I was happy with how everything
performed in today's rig anyway guys
that's it for today's PC if you have any
questions or comments and be sure to
drop a comment in the comment section
below and I'll catch you in another tech
video very soon also don't forget to hit
that like button if you love for ass
performance and I'll see you in the next
one peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
