the XFX RX 590 and we were comparing
that against some nvidia cards and i
couldn't help but notice that there was
some kind of a difference in image
quality and then some people were asking
in comments over the last few months for
me to investigate this and so today
we're gonna pull out the sony a7s ii
which is the main camera that we film on
here which has some carl zeiss lenses
we're gonna be recording off a 4k
monitor which is the bank you monitor
pretty photo accurate monitor then we're
going to comparing the images after the
fact and then going very deep into that
image to a pixel type level to see if we
can discern any differences between an
AMD graphics card which is their latest
RX 590 and then compare that to the our
TX 2070 then we take the video and the
images across to a 4k monitor which is
photo accurate and then examine these
side-by-side but one thing we will say
when we're doing the testing is we
notice straight away was that nvidia
colors can look washed out if you don't
change a setting in the Nvidia control
panel for some reason by default it has
the 16 232 in the video settings if you
change this to 0 to 255 then your blacks
and also your image in general will look
similar to that of AMD's without side
let's see what other differences there
are in five different games but before
we do take a look today's video is
brought to you by Squarespace and if
you've ever wanted to go out and build
your own website whether it be for a
small business or a startup then you can
do so with Squarespace because they're
offering a package that's so easy to
manage and they can build your own
website very easy even if you don't know
anything about building websites and the
best thing is it's so easy to manage
it'll only cost a fraction of the price
their companies that'll make websites
and manage them would have charged you
so if you want to check it out and also
save some money and there is a special
for techy our city viewers link is in
the description below so ambien and
video use a technology on their graphics
cards called Delta color compression
this differs from the maker to the maker
in that they use different algorithms
and hence at the core the image that
comes out on your screen will inherently
look different due to these companies
using these two different algorithms
since the GTX 10 series however
Nvidia have made a public note that
their compression technology is very
very efficient in that it will save
bandwidth when an image is being
processed
not a whole lot however on AMD site is
known about their Delta color
compression but one thing for sure is is
when I did the recent review of the XFX
RX 5 90s I said the intro I thought
there was a difference when it came to
actual detail and not colors when it
came to playing dota 2 and so I decided
to investigate this with five games here
today and so the first thing we did of
course was set that color difference in
the Nvidia control panel which I
recommend everyone with NVIDIA card
definitely do this but after we got to
this stage we noticed that from the far
view on the 4k monitor there wasn't a
whole lot of difference like if you
looked at these images and you did blind
a/b tests the majority of people I
guarantee you would not notice any
difference between these two graphics
cards if they had the same frame rates
and also the same graphics settings on
the same monitor anyway digging deeper
into the details here are first of all
pull up black ops 4 for you guys where I
was testing the single-player at 4k
Ultra settings and I dropped it down to
30 frames per second because we're
really just looking for image quality
here and this was the one of two games
out of the five games we tested here
today where I at a pixel level thought
there was really no difference it didn't
look worse on one or the other and so
when we looked at the tiles for example
they look pretty much the same we went
over to the rocks and then the shadows
and then the vehicles and they look
pretty similar there really was no
difference in the colors either so there
was real no clear winner when it came to
black ops 4 however moving over to dota
2 there definitely was a difference in
detail and I noticed this when it came
to pixel peeping on the grass and also
on the walls and I thought there was a
little bit of detail as well a
difference in favor of the AMD on the
flag itself so when we match these
images up as close as we could and keep
in mind it is very hard to get an exact
static image match on these so we did
test over different images multiple
times to sort of weed out the variants I
did think there was a tad bit more
detail to be had
on an AMD card at 4k Ultra settings when
it came to comparing the RX 590 versus
the r-tx 2070 so for dota 2 I would give
a slight victory to the AMD graphics
card however ironically enough when it
came to the performance figures the AMD
graphics cards were performing lower
than their nvidia counterparts more than
they should when it came to dota 2
however moving over to overwatch now
when we went to the same map at the same
area there was some places or objects
that we could compare side-by-side from
AMD to Nvidia and we saw that the rock
and also the house the roof the tiles on
the roof and also the shadows underneath
the wooden roof on the left there was no
real big difference here I couldn't
discern any winner out of the two I
thought for what it was worth these two
gravis cards pulled off pretty much a
draw when it came to overwatch also the
red tree that was pretty much the same
so overwatch had no clear winner but
moving over now to Far Cry 5 and here
was a little bit of a weird one because
the Nvidia colors definitely looked
different to the AMD colors around the
house the AMD especially near the water
looked a little bit washed out as
opposed to the Nvidia looking a little
bit more bluer and then when it came to
some of the other parts of the map as
well I thought detail was a little bit
better on the Nvidia card in this game
so for Far Cry 5 I would give the edge
here to the r-tx 2070 over AMD's rx 590
but now we move over to Forza horizon 4
and I thought this was a clear win for
AMD when we looked at the license plate
for example on the car the same
checkpoint spot I noticed that it was a
lot more detailed on the RX 590 as
opposed to the Nvidia graphics card the
r-tx 2070 also some other points like
the exhaust itself when we matched it up
I just thought the detail was better
there as well as well as the center
riding and this in my opinion was
probably the biggest difference of all
the games we tested here today and AMD
in this title as well does perform
better in video at least when we compare
to the majority of titles and the
average
but now it's time I guess to zoom out of
this whole equation and just take a look
and a step back and that is when you
compare the videos side by side there is
real no obvious difference I mean it's
nothing to write home about and say this
one is definitely better than this one
and it's I guess no real big reason to
go out and purchase either card over one
another I would however like to see
NVIDIA definitely fix those color
settings from the get-go in that they
don't default to washed out colors I
think that's nothing to really be proud
of and I'm not sure why they do this to
begin with because I know this problem
has existed for a few years now so in
video I'd like you to fix this settings
so people can get deeper blacks and
wider whites in their games and not have
a washed out image but ultimately
however from this video I probably
learned that I'm a visual type of person
as opposed to a audio type or a
kinesthetic so I don't really care a
whole lot for differences in audio or
things that relate to Kenneth's study
but when it comes to visual stuff if I
notice something I'll then go in detail
about it and I guess this video spawned
from that OC deenus and we guys hope you
enjoyed today's video if you did the me
sure to hit that like button and also
let us know in the comment section below
have you noticed the difference between
AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards in terms
of image fidelity if you have was there
one game that it was more apparent in
than the other love reading your
thoughts and opinions as always and also
if you haven't already don't forget to
check chicken and where I'm becoming a
Kiwi and also if you haven't already
don't forget to check out today's video
sponsor Squarespace link is in the
description below and I'll catch in
another technically very soon peace out
for now bye
