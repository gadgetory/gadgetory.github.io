I have to catch a flight from Japan to
the Gold Coast in Australia very soon in
a couple of hours actually and before I
do that I might have a quick shave
because I look like a bum and if you
look like a bum you get pulled over by
customs generals so while I'm all packed
up and ready to go and we have there a
bag that's full of power supplies and
then we've got the mini ITX rig this I'm
gonna carry them both on as carry-on
luggage and then over here we've got a
suitcase just packed full of used
hardware I've also even fitted in a
monitor in there sue so my friend he
didn't want a 24 inch monitor that I
gave him last year with a monitor stand
for whatever reason I've got no idea
never got the golf clubs and that is
pretty much stacked out at like 40 point
8 kilograms or something because you're
allowed like 800 grams over the 40
kilogram limit so hopefully we get that
through with no problems and I've only
got $10 left in my wallet
- damn so I just got back in and I got
through customs eh okay and right behind
me here we have the giveaway PC this is
the first of the stuff that is rocked up
big THANK YOU to Coolermaster and also
team group as well and anyway we have to
get this build done right now because
hardware unboxed and also science studio
are waiting on me to upload the video
for this so I'm gonna get on to building
this thing right now
doing all the b-roll and making this
thing look pretty
so here's a giveaway PC behind me it is
now complete however it's the next day
after I did this video which I'll put in
the link in the description below so
make sure you get in with a chance to
win this thing completely free I just
had to go crash out I was so tired slept
like 10 hours and now we're back into it
so let's take a look at what's on the
bench top so here these guys here's the
mess that awaits me I've actually got to
zoom out a little bit more so I've got a
a heap of new parts that came in we'll
talk about those a little bit later but
this is all the used parts that I picked
up in Japan I was surprised I even got
all this luggage back I mean I crammed
my clothes into a little carry-on bag
and also with a heap of power supplies
because they're really heavy and then I
got 40 kilos of luggage in my suitcase
so these parts were really cheap I mean
these power supplies $10 each and they
work really well especially the FSP ones
here they're extremely good 80 plus
silver and now even if they've been run
for a long time the good thing is is
that usually most of the time I'm not
powering these a 500 watt I'll be
powering them to say 400 even 300 watt
and with that they'll work completely
fine for another few years to come at
worst
but now moving on to the main prize here
we have the x58 lineup of motherboards
easily my favorite architecture of all
time mainly because this architecture is
still relevant in 2017 now these boards
I picked these up for around about 70 us
a pop each and at that price they're
extremely good value for money now they
usually go for around about a hundred
and fifty dollars or anything where up
to two hundred dollars if you want to
get one that's like brand-new condition
though the one thing that makes this CPU
line up or this architecture of the LGA
1366 lineup so good is that it was
released back in 2008 that's right 2008
so that's like nine years ago pretty
much and it's still relevant to this day
however the reason why this lineup of
motherboard the LGA 1366 lineup is so
good to this date is because of the CPU
prices you can go out and get an ex 5650
which is a six core 12 threaded Xeon for
around about $20 off Aliexpress or on
ebay they're also really cheap there
there's
the X 5660 which runs a little bit more
and has a higher multiplier which I do
recommend for overclocking and now you
can get these CPUs to 4.2 gigahertz and
you can get them out to achieve around a
1000 Cinebench score so that's like
really close to the 7700 K and another
thing about this architecture is as well
it uses the ring bus architecture ring
from Intel I believe it was the first
implementation on this lineup of
motherboard back in 2008 and it's still
relevant to this day again because the
7700 K uses the ring bus architecture -
even though it's been much improved
since this nalem lineup how with some
other really cool features about this
motherboard it's also got USB 3 onboard
I believe this is an NEC controller so
the speeds are actually really good
you've got again a clear CMOS button on
the back and you've got solder three
however the side of three was from
Marvel and it wasn't implemented
properly into these boards so I believe
they only run at half speed see if you
do get a motherboard like this you're
probably better off running it off the
Intel SATA 2 ports or of course linking
up an nvme SSD off the PCI Express Lanes
now speaking of PCI Express Lanes on
this motherboard
they come with 36 lanes of PCI Express
2.0 so that's probably the one graph
that I have with this architecture is
it's got PCI 2.0 but that's still plenty
enough for today's graphics cards and
the final thing to talk about with the
x58 lineup and why I love it is the
triple channel memory so your Rison and
cabi Lake architectures nowadays have
dual channel memory though they have
ddr4 memory which has much higher speeds
than the x58 lineup which uses ddr3
memory however since it is triple
channel it will be at a multiplier of
1.5 so if you get the ddr3 memory times
by 1.5 those speeds that's effectively
how fast this memory would run in
comparison to ddr4 memory roughly it's
not exactly the same but anyway
so in total I managed to pick up 6 x58
motherboards and also there was that one
that I pulled out of the $30.00 PC this
is a H 55 from asrock it has an i3 550
in it but I believe something like this
you know you can put in a I 5 750 a $10
power supply at
ix 670 and of course that hard drive we
picked up for 15 bucks and you've now
got a really kick-ass gaming PC for like
literally it's just over a hundred us so
I look forward to bringing that build to
the channel I think I just made a build
put a bill together except for the case
so stay tuned for that one we've got
here another H fifty-five motherboard
now this one is actually going to be a
continuation of a story then I'm gonna
talk about in another upcoming video
it's got to do with power supplies
because my friend he bought this PC off
me and isn't the motherboard from it and
it actually didn't work properly when he
got it and I was really confused I was
like dude you know I'd test these pcs
before I sell them and I sold him this
one in Japan and it wasn't working for
him at his house now actually in
hindsight wasn't the computer at all it
was actually got to do with this house
and the power so we'll talk about that
in a future video but this motherboard
is now back home I'm using it and it's
going to be awesome and the last model
we picked up here was the $10 z68
motherboard however it does have two
bent pins and unfortunately I can't test
it at the moment because I don't have a
CPU line up with native z68 support I do
have that 3770k which I picked up for
$100 which was an absolute bargain but I
believe I'll have to update the BIOS
before I can get this to work
because in Japan generally people never
update their biases at all so I'm
banking on the fact that it hasn't
upgraded the boss so I'm gonna be doing
that later and seeing if I can fix it
but onto some other weird pickups I
managed to pick up this it's a spawn
action figure now I usually never pick
up figures I'm not really into the whole
figure collecting thing but I saw this
for five dollars and I absolutely love
the original spawn movie and this figure
looks pretty badass so I was like okay
I'm gonna give this a go and I'm gonna
have a little decoration this is the
spawn action figured I don't know does
anyone even remember that movie and did
anyone like it I think it was generally
negatively received in the press but
when I went to see it at the movies I
actually enjoyed it so there's hence the
action figure and now we also got some
local Japanese razor blades these came
in around fifteen dollars and you get
nine cartridges and I've actually had a
shave with these in the past they're
amazing they compete with
the Gillette's which cost X amount more
so perhaps performance even when you're
having a shave
now another used part to come back in I
didn't pay anything for this actually
gave this to my friend when I left Japan
was this 24 inch a Samana now it still
works perfectly fine at CCFL backlit
however he didn't want it I was like
dude like what's going on you don't want
a free 24 inch 1080p monitor and you've
also got the exact same one at your
house now we bought these back in like
2009 I believe at the same store so we
both had the same monitor and I was like
dude you can have a dual monitor setup
and it'll be awesome and it was like no
I did I don't want it I was like okay so
I fit and managed to fit this in the
suitcase and also he didn't want the
monitor stand that I left behind for him
so I was like no I'll take the both of
them back to Oz managed to get them in
the suitcase err okay and you know
something like this is like worth like
$40 it's an extendable model now some of
the last pickups we got here was these
audio interfaces that were going for
like 60 us a pop as you can see here
they've got compression onboard they're
absolutely amazing for voice work so I
bought two of them I'm gonna be sending
one to Steve from hardware unboxed so he
can have one as well if we're doing live
streams for you guys and also a PS Vita
as well which I picked up for like $65
and it came included with the memory
card so I will be hacking this or I will
be trying to get some retro games and
make it play movies for me which I look
forward to doing because I need
something when I travel to sort of waste
time but anyway guys let's clean up all
this mess so we can take a look at some
of the new parts that also came in while
I was gone
and also before we move on to the new
parts Nathan a subscriber sent in aw
3565 which is a six core 12 threaded
Xeon now this differs from the ex 5660
in that it's only got a qpi score of one
so to actually work on practically every
x58 motherboard if I remember correctly
and then another subscriber sent in a
motherboard so thank you very much
Kristen from sunny Boston he sent over a
motherboard which he no longer needed I
believe it doesn't work anymore but it
also comes with 4 gigabytes of RAM and a
CPU so at worst I could definitely use
some of the parts off that and then
another thing you guys have been
complaining about is that whenever I
boot up a computer I only use like a USB
stick or a lately I've been using this
like freaking knife that I found lying
around to open letters however people
like do just rip out power buttons from
PCs so in Japan I actually found some
old PC cases around my friend's house
and I've ripped out all the power
buttons off them so I am going to be
using these to now boot up those
computers when I test them so here guys
here's some of the new parts that I got
sent as well there's also Rison 3 which
I'm yet to review I'll be reviewing that
very shortly after I get through some of
this stuff but see sonic were nice
enough to send out their 751 Gold power
supply so this looks like it will be one
of those power suppliers of course
that's just king of the hill fully
modular gold rated only using it on a
build on the channel very shortly so
stay tuned for that
and then we've got here the master keys
master light keyboard and mouse set now
one thing about it is I tried this at
Computex it's a sort of like membrane
tactile feed so it's kind of like an so
they call it mem chemical so mechanical
and membrane hybrids so this comes with
a mouse as well now when I did try these
I did like them so I'm gonna properly
review them and stack them up against
some other keyboards but I believe they
will have some hard competition of
course with those Aliexpress keyboards
especially that I blew the one that I
reviewed recently on the channel that
was a pretty good deal for like 25 bucks
so this thing's gonna have a hard time
but if it does work out especially with
the input
a full RGB then it could be definitely
an option for people looking for a
decent keyboard at a decent price now
here we go to GC X 1080 from MSI this is
the armored edition I actually bought
this as a replacement in my desktop
because I had put all my graphics cards
to mining so this one I got this for 670
Australian dollars it's a freaking
bargain when the eBay sales were
happening so I had to pull the trigger
on this I just think it was just such a
good deal so this is going in my main
rig now I'm gonna be using a 1080
instead of a 1080i because that's mining
Z cache and yeah this is the one I'm
gonna be using for editing videos and
gaming because anything over I found
like even like a ten sixty or even like
a 1050 Ti is enough for what I do in
Adobe Premiere Pro I don't really need
anything more in terms of CUDA
performance so this is even overkill for
what I do now we go to set a zyo Mimi I
think I pronounced that right it's a
smartphone I got this all banggood well
actually they sent it out because they
wanted a shout-out for their website in
exchange for the phone and I was like I
was really curious to try out this phone
because I if you guys don't know I use
Huawei at the moment and I absolutely
love what Huawei are about this one if
it can compete with the Huawei and come
in at a better price then it could
definitely be a contender in terms of
people who are looking for value for
money when they buy a smartphone so this
one also has I believe dual lens on it
which is something that I look for
because you can get that bokeh effect
which is great for Instagram photos off
your smart phone straight away so
looking forward to comparing that to the
highway phone it won't be a conventional
smart review because I really don't know
what I'm doing with smart phones but I
will compare it for what I need it for
and see if it checks out so here's the
last piece of the puzzle this is the
BitFenix nova TG with the TG standing
for tempered glass absolutely love in
this case I saw this at Computex we did
a video on it
I'm gonna be doing a build on this thing
now I'm just not exactly sure on the
release dates and the prices and all
that stuff as I just got back so I gotta
check the dates on that it's a very
Pacific case that flew all the way over
this Pacific Ocean but on a more serious
note I was thinking this case with those
parts that I showed before that I was
going to do
with GTX 670 and really showcase a
potato plus 50
so we guys hope you enjoyed today's
massive unboxing and look at all the
products there was a lot of stuff that I
just couldn't ignore those deals in
Japan they're just too good to pass up
especially there's x58 motherboards and
also big thank you to the patron
contributors over the last year I've now
got enough money to upgrade my camera
gear and make some other upgrades to the
channel so I'll be doing that very
shortly thank you guys so much and also
be doing the monthly live with Steve
from hardware unbox very soon so stay
tuned for that and I'll catch you guys
in another tech video very soon with
probably a gtx 1050 TI vs RX 560 video
which was on the backlog and also the
Rison 3 1200 and 1300 x i'll be
comparing that against the g 45 60 and
also probably the 1400 where it kind of
sits in between but guys love you all
i'll catch another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye
so this was one thing that really
devastated me I just got back and my
ghetto houses guys these headphones that
I built a long time ago I absolutely
love them they're now broken and my
brother reckons he dropped them and I
was like no way you know you don't drop
a pair of headphones and boss them like
that and then I started looking
statistically and this is what was going
on there's another pair of Fidelio el
ones I'm guessing the same thing
accidentally dropped them or ran over
them with a chair another pair of
Fidelio el one's broken so I now have
three high-end or at least medium and
headphones busted because these are HD 9
v v 9 5s they're actually really good
headphones the old ones are my favorite
headphones for end-user listening I
don't use them for editing but these my
brothers busted all three of them now
and said that they're just been weak and
it's like no way I've been using
headphones for twice as long as he has
these are V mode of headphones and these
are arguably a lot weaker than those
headphones and they haven't broken at
all like I've been using these for
editing and heavily using these and
they're still working at rip and even
the skin has come off the top and the
bottom of them and they're still working
so statistically speaking my brother has
been raging I think and he has been
busting my headphones up and that's what
dad man reckons as well he reckons he
caught him smashing the headphones so
you saw him busting my headphones I saw
him and I heard him</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
