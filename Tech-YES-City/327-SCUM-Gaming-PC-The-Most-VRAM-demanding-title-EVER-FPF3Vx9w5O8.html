been released on PC and if you wanted to
run it you could easily just go down to
the worst part of your neighborhood
where you live you're probably find
something but if you want to build a PC
that can run this title hopefully at
1080p I don't know yet Sam tried the
components then this may be the right
video for you we've got a nice blend
here of used and new parts mixed
together that's coming in at a total
price point of 327 US dollars or if in
straya 445 ozzie now going through the
components first up we have the RX 570
we pick this up for a hundred and fifty
dollars then we've got the case budget
case here got this for 30-odd z will
clearly give this a bathroom and it's
cheap it's flimsy but hopefully it gets
the job done moving through the list we
have a vs 350 from corsair budget pounce
play it should be all we need
since the minimum requirements of this
game state that you need an i5 44:30
or an FX 6300 now we're using a g 45 60
which is a dual-core 4 threaded CPU
however the IPC and the clock speeds are
much greater than that of an i5 44 30 so
hopefully we should get away with that
we've got 8 gigabytes of ddr4 memory
h1 10 motherboard now we pick these up
the G 45 60 could still get this for
around about 64 US dollars or 78
Australian dollars its original asking
price and it does come with a CPU cooler
now the benefit of going with this is
that these motherboards the h1 10s
they've been forsaken they've been
forgotten and so we picked this up for
nothing but you probably couldn't expect
to get that for nothing because the
person thought it was broken but if you
want to pick one up you can get them on
eBay for like under 40 US dollars in
Australia around about 50 AUD but
continuing on with the list ddr4 memory
I know it's expensive I picked some of
this stuff up to mismatched sticks for
60 Aussie dollars about 42 USD but even
if you picked it up at asking price for
a brand new kit it would still make this
build worthwhile since gravis cards
especially this one in particular have
down in prices quite a lot hard drive I
picked this out of the build an OEM
build it's a one terabyte Seagate drive
I got this for about 20 Ozzie dollars or
in USD terms 14 US dollars now using a
used hard drive in a build like this is
not a problem since we're going with a
budget 120 gigabyte SSD this will be
able to hold our game on it which is
scum and also be able to boot up our
computer quickly as well as making
things snappy so even if this hard drive
slow this will counteract that big time
and in 2018 I just can't afford a
missing
so we're coming in with a whole build
cost that is definitely one that's kept
on a budget but since we've used used
parts we do have to give them a bit of a
tech yes cleanse so we're gonna quickly
get on with the build and then after
that install scum which you can pick up
for twenty US dollars so let's get this
party started
so we just finished the tech yes cleanse
in particular on this gravis card and
also on the motherboard itself they're
both looking pretty much brand new now
to match the rest of the build and since
this case doesn't have any fans in it
we're actually gonna add in two really
cheap rainbow fans they're not even
really RGB because they just got preset
different colors on them and hopefully
it turns out all well but let's get this
build on the way
and here we are now at conclusion time
and this PC was able to place come not
really that well at 1080p but more so at
720p this game really shocked me at how
much vram it can utilize even on lower
settings 720 people getting close to
using up all the four gigabytes of vram
available on the RX 570 now keep in mind
this was with custom settings but even
putting those settings on low this game
was so hungry for that VRAM not only
that was also hungry for the graphical
processing power too so a 1080p will
getting just over 40 frames per second
hovering between 40 and 50 most the time
but the stuttering was so bad this is
what made the game really not that
enjoyable but when we closed it down to
720p this is where things became really
exciting the game is beautiful note that
if you do wish to get a really high-end
PC then this game will definitely
deliver in terms of how it looks it's
think of it as like a pub G but more
optimized and better looking but also
much more hungrier and what it needs for
its specs in order to run well so 720p
we're getting over 80 fps with the G 45
60 the two core for thread CPU is
absolutely fine for this game in my
opinion and when we dropped it down 720p
was using up less actual system memory
as well near half that of what it was
using at 1080p now ironically enough I
didn't realize that one of these sticks
was actually and I hate gigabyte stick
so we had 12 gigabytes of ddr4 memory in
this build so 720p was scum you will run
around 6 gigabytes of RAM at least and
then if you go up to 1080p you'll one
around 12 gigabytes of RAM so I think
the RAM was just within spec but of
course as we look at the graphics card
the vram and the actual processing of
the graphics card itself this game
definitely needs that power so I was
really surprised that the rx 570 was
having trouble at 1080p running this
game which it was
as we just said before 720p the G 4560
was getting over 80 fps a lot of the
times and it was a lot smoother as well
so the massive stuttering that was there
higher resolutions wasn't there at lower
resolutions which means that the
graphics card was actually bottlenecking
this set up so there it all is it seems
like it's a pretty well made game
I was definitely enjoying it once I got
the hang of it you have to run around
you've got to feed yourself you've got
to stay hydrated
I do recommend starting off getting your
person to have max boxing skills that's
when things got really exciting for me
and I started going up sort of punching
on with these zombies and I started to
get good at it so before that I'll sort
of having a bit of trouble but
regardless it was a bit of fun I can see
the appeal of this game and especially
if you jump into the multiplayer you're
gonna be having a lot of fun with scum
but as for the CPU utilization itself it
seemed like the core utilization across
all four threads was pretty much equal
and when we stepped it down to the 720p
resolution we saw it was going near 100%
on all threads a lot of the time just
that it's a very demanding title but
ultimately this little scum PC here its
little it can handle the game and it
does look pretty good and it does run
pretty quiet in terms of power
consumption when we overclock the gravis
card just a little bit to get more
performance out of it it was using about
250 Watts from the wall so the vs 350 is
absolutely fine for a little build like
this and even if we stepped it up to a 4
core for example this power supply would
still be able to handle that so
ultimately I'm happy with the way the
builds ended up but also stay tuned for
another video where we'll take a look at
the G 45 60 and see what it can still do
in 2018 because when it's come to gaming
I haven't had any problems with this to
call for thread CPU especially coupled
with mid-range graphics cards which I
feel a lot of people are going to be
doing when it comes to the CPU and GPU
combination anyway with all that aside I
hope you guys enjoyed today's video if
you did then be sure to hit that like
button let us know in the comments
section below
have you tried outs come if so what was
your experience and what we have
thoughts and opinions if not let me know
what's stopping you from playing it it
isn't too expensive I think at $20 us
it's coming in a really good price point
and also one thing is well I did have to
update the boss before I could use the G
4560 because technically it is a seventh
gen CPU and this is a 6th gen
motherboard but after that everything
ran absolutely fine and with all that
aside I'll put some links in the
description below if you wish to search
for similar parts to make a similar
build and I'll catch an another tech
video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
