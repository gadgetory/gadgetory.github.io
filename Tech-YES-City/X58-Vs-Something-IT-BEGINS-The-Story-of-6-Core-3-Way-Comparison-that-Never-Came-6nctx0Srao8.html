i'ma to you guys today with a build-up
to the next video that we've got coming
in the works I've got to build these
three rigs one of them is an X 58 X 56
75 rig the other two one being an Intel
8400 and the other horizon 520 600 rigs
so this ultimate 6 core showdown is
happening before the end of the month
also thank you guys so much for watching
the rising 2000 series review and
leaving all the feedback that you did
love you guys so much and in the
background at the moment so we're gonna
hit the road soon and the reason a big
reason for it is because in the
background we've got the NOC review
getting set up I'm downloading a heap of
stuff at the moment and that'll take a
while because my Internet's not even
though it's better than it was it's not
super good yet so that'll be hitting the
channel soon stay tuned for that but
what we've got here we're gonna go over
to the table here because we got a list
I'm gonna go get 2 cases 3 1 terabyte
hard drive 3 120 gig SSDs 2 power
supplies and they're gonna be decent or
decent that's my writing it's terrible I
know a gigabytes of ddr4 question mark
because we've got to see how much of a
ripoff it is and for the Intel rig we're
gonna use the asrock motherboard with
the 8400 I also have to go pick up a
stock Intel cooler as well because I've
ran out with the i5 2400 that God sent
in I had to use them with those machines
so I'm gonna go pick up one of them from
a friend everyone seems to have them
lying around this here is going to be
the risin 5 6 core Rigby 350 motherboard
of course budget value for money and
then for cooling we're using the freezer
33 which is a pretty good budget CPU
cooler does get some really good numbers
I'm looking forward to seeing how that
will take the 6 core what Heights it'll
take it to but in the background here
this was a deal I picked up earlier this
month and the deals hunts coming to
sustain tuned for that as well so much
coming in so little time but this year
we picked this case up this is a cooler
master something and we got this for a
hundred Australian box which would be
under 80 USD now it comes with an RGB
LED controller 3 RGB fans they've
custard installed them and also a 1200
watt power supply so what a bargain I
mean this is going to be the new home to
the x58 rig and I'm so glad I got that
deal because I need good power supplies
at the moment
ran out so they're the three rigs we're
gonna put together and we're gonna go
hit the road and do that right now
so just about to leave and this rocked
up here another x4 70 Taiji ultimate
motherboard so I have two of these now
so I'm going to be giving away one of
these in the upcoming review for this
motherboard so stay tuned for that and
as well also sent out their ML 240 are
from waltz from cool master but they
sent it out with the package because
they wanted me to show that this RGB
cooler can sync up with this motherboard
via polychrome RGB yeah let's finally
get out the door so we just got back now
when they didn't have the power supplies
that I wanted in stock even though they
said they had them in stock so we ended
up going with this 550 watt smart series
and a vs 650 and three one terabyte
drives they had those they had two of
these Western Digital greens 49 ozzie
for 120 GB SSD really good value now how
to get a kingston to fill the gap and
then there's the two cases down there
BitFenix comrade and also the MX 330
with a clear side panel so let's build
these pcs up and take a look at them
so finish the two new builds and that
little mini ITX is looking so cute in
this midsize case and we've also got the
PCIe cables just hanging here ready on
both builds for that GTX 10 attr we're
gonna use the Galax so they're ready to
go and I'm probably gonna leave the side
panels office we don't have any included
fans at the front of both these cases
but it's time to move on now to the x58
build and it's over here so this is it
right now and we can see here this is a
mess it's a jungle sandwich and it needs
to sort of be deciphered a little bit so
I pulled this front RGB controller out
we're gonna take that out there's just
too many cables you're gonna sort of
Reese if through the cables that are
ready in here then we need and also give
it a data vac at the very least and of
course some wd-40 shine but let's get
that done
so spend about 20 minutes cleaning this
thing up so all the cables that we don't
need there have all been taken out and I
never know what was going on there it's
like some weird tube around the input
output of the front panel but anyway all
that aside x58 is ready to go inside
this case and after that we'll clean it
all up and give it some wd-40 lovin
so here we've done it we've got three
builds and they're all complete ready to
go so ladies and gentlemen I want you to
place your bets who do you think is
going to win this comparison because I'm
gonna be testing a lot of games I'm
gonna do productivity and streaming
benchmarks and of course I'm going with
x58 he's so underrated he's so
underappreciated nowadays people just
don't know what he's all about but he's
gonna come up and save the day for you
and you're not gonna even know when it's
gonna come anyway quick recap on the
specs we've got an X 56 75 his clocked
at 4.5 gigahertz
he's got triple channel random ddr3
memory and of course that is the
graphics card that will be used across
all three different systems moving on to
the Intel system here we have the 8400
with a stock Intel cooler on a b3h 370
motherboard actually sorry not a B 360
so they're the same in performance
though you're not gonna get any
difference between them they both
support 2666 max on the ddr4 memory so
moving across here now B 350 Rison v
2,600 2,600 X same thing especially with
this cooler on it it's got 32 hundred
megahertz memory in it but I want to
hear from you guys feedback what do you
think is a fair memory speed for this
system here I need your feedback because
he's gonna get clocked up to know as
high as this budget cooler will take it
that's where it's gonna go and it's
gonna get competiting into this and this
so need your feedback there but while we
wait for that feedback we're gonna go to
the story of this broken promise so here
we are back at it again with the story
behind the burthen promise last time it
was the Quad SLI and we did fulfill that
video I'll put the link to the story up
here for you guys if you want to check
that out but this time around I did
promise 6 cores versus 6 cores versus 6
course now the 8400 that dropped last
year before Christmas and of course it
was out of stock and a lot of people
couldn't get the CPUs and then they
complained about the z3 70 motherboards
so I was kind of waiting in the
sidelines thinking well it's kind of
pointless to do that comparison if the B
360 motherboards or the H 310
motherboards
unavailable yet and the reason is
because it's going to be a broken video
it's gonna be like okay you have to go
get a Z 370 and just know the amount of
people that would complain that just be
like can't get a Z can't get a B 360 you
can't get a ch3 ten this video is
pointless so I was thinking well does
that there was that big feel and then
there's also the rumors of the second
gen rising coming out so I'll singing to
myself well I did make this promise
because I did want to see how hard the Z
anka go and we will be seeing that very
soon but then there was that as well
second generation rise and something to
myself well if I make that video in
January February or even March then
there'll be a heap of more comments like
well why didn't you just wait for the
risin 5 2600 this video is invalid so as
far as I saw it I was like well if I do
this video I'm damned and then if I do
it and then I do it again in a month
laid off you'll get people complaining
that hey you already just did this video
you click baiting so this time around I
thought to myself it was a strategic
play wait for the second gen and it just
so happened at the b3 60s and h3 10
motherboards they all came out at the
round the same time so perfect timing to
get this video done now
and yeah that was the tackiest city
strategic play guys so that's the story
behind this broken promise of course
that video will be out within the next
week so stay tuned for that
make sure you subbed with notifications
the email bell thing then you get the
video as soon as it drops I usually
release videos around about 6 p.m.
Australian time not sure what time that
is Eastern Time I think it's like 4 a.m.
so that should be when the videos are
dropping usually also let me know in the
description below clock speeds memory
speeds and also games that you want to
see tested with this comparison and also
I'm going to test productivity and
streaming as well and so that'll be
hitting in one big video instead of
doing in two parts or three parts I'm
just gonna drop it in one big video for
you guys but of course until that video
drops are going to install windows on
all these machines getting at the games
up to scratch make sure they're running
right and make sure the over clocks are
set in both the AMD system and the
old-school Xeon system and then once
that's done I'll be getting on to the
testing as well so if you've got some
games that you really want to see test
awesome productivity benchmarks you
really want to seize tested then drop a
request in the comments below and I'll
try and get that done for you guys and I
hope you enjoyed today's video and the
story is well behind the broken promise
look forward to giving you guys more
content very soon and now I'm gonna get
on to testing this Intel naki I'll get
any of that reviewed on so catcher
another tech video very soon he's out
for now bye
we need to stop abandoning PC hardware
guys wait no abandoned so I can pick it
up cheap and then we've got the RTG
sports or whatever they call this thing
D so it's late at night we've got the
sound tiles the ones that we don't need
from the office upstairs also got those
crappy white sound tiles over there and
instead of throwing them out
we decided would make some diffusers
which you put them in this in the studio
for example inside and they instead of
having echoes going off long sort of
hallways since the studio is quite long
we can put these in the room and that
will just pretty much block out the
sound like diffuse it yeah that's the
best word to use it so we're gonna put
these together now by just with duct
tape these three sort of like throwing
out postage things that no one needs
there's a big one here it's gonna make
three of them and test trial them and
put duct tape in them and in the bottom
so we've put wood so they balanced so
they don't fall over and yeah we're just
gonna wrap them sound tiles around them
and see how it goes so here we have it
now the sound of uses are finished these
things will hopefully help in the studio
so we've made up to three of them and
after that we might make up two more
just depending on how we fit them out in
the studio and how they actually work if
they actually really do work so gonna
leave them outside until the morning
because the fact that we used like
silicon and yeah so if we put that
inside the silicon we'll just might get
on the carpet and I'm not risking that
so gonna leave them outside good night
guys have a good sleep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
