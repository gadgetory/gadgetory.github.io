video we're taking a look at the ps2
mouse and comparing it against the
latest and greatest USB mice and you're
probably wondering what is this brain
the 1980s I wish it was
but on a more serious note today we're
gonna take a look at this mouse which I
picked up at a junk store probably over
a year and a half ago for a dollar and
I've been meaning to do this video for a
while but we're gonna be comparing it
against these other two mice with a
hundred FPS on a hundred Hertz monitor
and see if there's any difference in the
input lag and that's the total time it
takes your mouse by the time you click
it to actually put out a signal on your
monitor so total system input lag today
we're gonna be testing this port versus
the USB mice now we already know from
previous experience that a Logitech G
302 is practically one of the best mice
you can get out there in terms of how
responsive it is so seeing how the ps2
Mouse goes against this is gonna be a
big eye-opener for me personally but
also let's go through a little bit of
history of why the ps2 port still exists
the ps2 port was designed over 31 years
ago in 1987 by IBM named after their
personal systems to computer however it
wasn't until in 1999 that we saw the
first commercially available optical
mouse this was introduced from Microsoft
with their aunt Ellie
if you guys remember the CS 1.6 days
this became a very popular name for the
mouse to use if you're playing this game
competitively myself using one of these
back in the day now it was a great
upgrade over the trackball mice which
were just terrible after they got some
dust buildup and you had to clean them
out regularly and even then you didn't
get a consistent tracking experience
though of course what about the laser
mouse which is inherently a bit
different to the optical mouse that came
into play in 2004 although originally
designed in 1999 by sun microsystems it
took a logitech in 2004 a partnership to
introduce this mouse with the MX 1000
and later in 2009 since in those five
years people realized that they didn't
track properly on glass surfaces they
introduced the dark field laser and you
could actually see this on camera
although you couldn't see it it was
invisible to the human eye a very weird
dilemma that I thought came out with the
filming of a camera
however the ps2 port itself does still
have its benefits in today's market for
instance if you're in the data backup
industry there may be very crucial data
but you just can't risk getting leaked
into the wrong hands and so with the ps2
keyboard and mouse you're then able to
disable all the USB ports on that system
and hence not allowing anyone to put a
USB key in and copy off data also peers
- keyboards themselves have full Anki
rollover essentially what this is is if
you don't press as many keys as you like
at the same time and they will all
register typically on Cheaper USB
keyboards you can only press up to six
keys at one time more expensive USB
keyboards on the other hand do integrate
the ps2 interface into their keyboards
and hence allowing them to support full
and key rollover that's why you do see
some USB keyboards with ps2 adapters and
they will
viii appears to port though another
reason of course is battery savings on
laptops laptops still used with peers to
interface on both their keyboards and
also their track pads and this is
because they work via a system known as
the interrupt system this is when you
press a key he will send a signal
directly to the CPU as opposed to a USB
which will pole itself to the USB
controller and so what you're allowed to
do here is now save battery because you
don't need the keyboard and the trackpad
on at all times as opposed to the USB
keyboard and mice they sometimes have to
be on at all times
hence draining power on a laptop device
and the last benefit to the ps2 port
itself is of course that legacy support
and the fact that it will work in any
BIOS
so it's great for computer technicians
who need to get settings right and make
things work from the Gecko as sometimes
USB devices can introduce their own
problems though nowadays on systems
instead of having two ps2 ports they're
generally integrated into one and a cool
fact about this port is is that you can
use a splitter and still get a ps2
keyboard MPs to Mouse to plug in to this
device however with that being said if
you do wish to use a ps2 keyboard and
mouse then you will have to plug it in
before your system boots as if you plug
it in and then you try to use it you'll
then have to restart your system as
opposed to a USB mouse or keyboard you
can plug it in and it will generally
work from the get-go without having to
restart your system and of course now
it's time to get onto that part that
y'all have been waiting for and it is
the results the ps2 Mouse by I didn't
even know who it doesn't even have a
brand name on it this scored just the
same as the other USB mice I was kind of
a little bit sad to see this Mouse just
do the same I was hoping there would be
at least a little bit of an edge to this
port because I have heard that it does
give an edge on the keyboards and so
with that I'm going to be testing the
keyboards in a future video but this one
here it scored exactly the same as these
other two mice which in ways is really
good news for the USB mice because they
tout themselves as being gaming mice and
I know in the past I have test
particular mice over the USB ports and
they have been slower than the G 302
that's a definite so what we see here is
that they're scoring between 60 and 70
milliseconds all across the board that's
from when I click the button and by the
way I'm clicking it really fast and
that's to weed out variance when I'm
doing that we're noticing that it's
about 6 to 7 frames delayed and each
frame represents 10 milliseconds on the
100 FPS camera and so the monitor itself
of course having a 100 FPS cap in volc√°n
on Wolfenstein 2 and also being on a 100
Hertz monitor it's a really good test to
see how many frames we are delayed by
the time we click this button and hence
why it's sometimes 60 milliseconds and
sometimes it's 70 milliseconds but it
was good to see that across all three
mice the results were the same so what
that says is that the ps2 mouse here is
the original it's pretty much the base
standard for having no or low input lag
and then we look at the G 302 and that's
got of course really good low input lag
and then we look at the Zowie fk2 and
that also scored in the same field so
those two USB mice they're the master
that I'm using here in the channel at
the moment they're both really good mice
but at least for me with this ps2 Mouse
I can now put it on the shelf and not
worry that I'm losing any advantages by
switching over to a USB mouse but of
course ps2 port it's not going anywhere
at least in the near future it does have
its benefits me personally though I do
use a USB mouse and keyboard nowadays I
found on the ps2 keyboard itself that
very rarely with an overclocked system
my system will crash out sometimes very
rarely and if now if that happens while
I'm editing a video there could be
problems I have found on this ps2 Mouse
though while I was using it for a little
bit of time there was no crashing
whatsoever so very weird dilemma that
one that crashing I have to look into a
little bit more but one cool thing to
note is if you guys are on a budget and
you are getting into gaming then
something like this is not a bad option
I mean you can still pick up Pierce two
mice for around about five dollars and
at least the good thing with that is is
that you'll know at least with
ps2 mouse that you just be getting
straight gaming there's no BS on a five
dollar ps2 Mouse you just put it on plug
it in and where you go you're gaming and
you get the lowest input lag possible as
opposed to some of these other USB mice
I haven't tested them yet but they could
introduce delays from anywhere from 10
to 20 milliseconds I have seen 10
milliseconds plus on $50 mice who the
one thing I will say before I get on out
of here and one thing that'll be sorely
missed with this ps2 Mouse is quite
simply the simplicity of it this shape
is honestly for me perfect it's a
similar shape to the logitech g3 and
this was a mouse that was designed a
long time ago so in ways I feel like the
gaming mice industry is kind of losing
focus on where they're going I mean some
of these designs of these mice coming
out nowadays are just ridiculous for me
personally as a fingertip gripper
this mouse here represents the perfect
shape it's the original design it's so
perfect the weight balance is great it's
ambidextrous as well so if you're
left-handed you can take advantage of it
and all they need to do is whack a
couple of side buttons on it and you've
got yourself a really good gaming mouse
this mouse here weight isn't
70 grams it's absolutely awesome for
fingertip grippers who are playing RTS
or flick shooting in fps and also on
that note there's no acceleration
built-in so pro gamers mean they might
want to just think about using something
like this if they still exist and they
need that set dpi so not too bad after
all with the ps2 laser mouse it's just
for me personally I'm so used to my G
302 now the way that works the way it
moves I don't think I can change over to
anything else I actually tried changing
over to the FK 2 and that didn't go so
well but anyway guys I hope you enjoyed
today's video if you did then be sure to
hit that like button and let me know in
the comment section below if you enjoyed
this video if you want to see any other
videos like this I love going off on
these crazy tangents sometimes today's
video was a lot of fun to make and it
gave me some answers that I've sort of
been curious to find out all this time
although it was kind of as expected
if you ask me but anyway I'll catch you
guys in another tech video very soon
he's out for now bye
Melora if you guys remember this mouse
it was very popular in the csgo
community as moment they're both really
good mice but this ps2 mouse eyes one
advantage of a lag USB mouse however
would be the fact that if you click on
clickbait you're now delayed by 10 to 20
milliseconds when you click on that
click bait but if you guys are in the
market for a mouse you so now we're
going to be moving on to the results</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
