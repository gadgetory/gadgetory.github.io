finally and right here on the desk we've
got the gaming ITX from as rob this is
their fatality series it's got two DIMM
slots supporting up to 32 gigabytes of
ddr4 memory 6 + 2 phase power design
also got USB type-c on the back however
today here we're gonna take it through
all the paces and see if it can handle
an 8 core 16 threaded 2,700 X and if it
can up until what overclocked so we're
gonna have thermal imaging camera also
gonna test out that onboard audio for
you guys see if all the ports are
working and the nvm is well let's get on
with the show so now we just finished
running the B 450 gaming ITX through the
gauntlet of tests here and at 4
gigahertz the 2700 X was running
absolutely fine VRMs was staying under
90 degrees this was in a 23 degree
ambient controlled environment and then
we managed to go into the boss and
overclock this to 4.2 gigahertz which is
pretty much the max safe OC form a 2700
X without pumping a whole lot of extra
voltage and wattage through the CPU
itself now we are using the h1 10 I cool
off from Corsair does a great job of
cooling and at these levels the VRMs
were going above 110 degrees Celsius so
you could imagine that in a mini ITX
case which is probably what you're gonna
do with this motherboard you will
probably not want to run it at 4.2
gigahertz unless you've got an active
vrm cooling solution on this motherboard
so we went from 220 watts from the wall
power draw to 284 just 200 extra mega
Hertz and the V tip itself is about 40
to 50 millivolts when under stress so
moving into the UEFI boss this is where
things are really easy and simple to use
if it's your first time overclocking
it'll be absolute breeze in this bias
you can change your CPU speed and below
that your voltages and then down below
that you can set in things like XMP
profiles change memory timings they've
also included RGB control from the boss
itself if you don't wish to install
polychrome RGB software your full
control over different styles individual
green red blue channels as well as
fantastic tuning software where you
control the three PWM headers to set
different profiles which you can then
save in the device itself quickly moving
through some other things we got USB 2
speeds absolutely fine across all ports
as well as the nvme port on the back
being a gen 3 x4 solution showing that
with the 970 Evo doing a test in a SSD
show that those speeds are reaching
their maximum potential - which is good
news and then moving on into the audio
where I do do some rigorous testing here
both on the audio out and the mic in my
comport seems to have very strong noise
reduction maxing this out of 100 volume
n + 30 DB revealed no noise at all so
it's good if you're a gamer and you
don't really care too much about the
audio quality but if you're doing
professional recordings you may wish to
look at something else moving on to the
levels themselves very interesting here
99 volume and below there is no
crosstalk leak crosstalk remains at
around minus 80 decibels which are
really good numbers though bumping it up
to a hundred volume did leak in on the
right channel just a little bit of
crosstalk so that problem still does
linger there so in other words if you're
using headphones on this really good
audio then just keep it at 99 volume or
below moving on into the levels
themselves running a sweep test the
frequency response is phenomenal on this
board it just keeps getting better and
better we're looking at seven Hertz and
under only a one decibel drop off which
is phenomenal for onboard audio so good
job on that as rock and then the last
thing with the audio was there was a
little bit of an imbalance between the
right and left channel right channel was
about one and a half decibels stronger
which is a little bit off maybe it's
just this sample here but if you do get
this motherboard and you do notice that
is it a little bit off the right channel
stronger than your left then perhaps you
can balance that out in Windows audio or
some other audio device manager itself
and here we are with conclusion of the B
450 gaming ITX from asrock and as we saw
those numbers if you are getting an
eight-course 16 threaded 2700 X this
thing will handle it absolutely fine at
4 gigahertz if you're going for an
enthusiast overclock around 4.2 then you
may wish to get some active vrm cooling
especially if you're dropping it in a
mini ITX case where airflow might not be
the best even if 4 gigahertz make sure
that you do get some good airflow here
because we tested it open air 23 degrees
C ambient here so I imagine it would get
hotter in a Mini ITX case but what we
saw with those audio numbers is well
very impressive they're really just
getting it right in terms of features
fun
and they've moderately-priced this board
too and I'll put some links in the
description below for you guys so be
sure to check them out if you are
interested in this little board of
course it'll handle the 2400 0 20 200 G
absolutely fine you go to display and
HDMI ports out of the back too and if
you enjoy this one and be sure to hit
that like button and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye board here we just
okay can I just stick a screwdriver in
that shouldn't get too hot there we go
all right
thanks for watching the review and if
you've made it this far as rocked a
teaming I would take it you need to give
away two of these be 450 gaming artex
motherboards all you have to do to enter
is click on the link in the description
below completely free to enter
no-strings-attached international
giveaway good luck I hope you guys win
and I've already said peace out now buy
but I'll say it again needs out for now
