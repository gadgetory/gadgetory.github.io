motherboard you need something that'll
be a thirst crusher
well the fatality i7 gaming might be for
you welcome back to tech yes it is brand
coming to you guys today with a full
review of the gaming i7 fatality which
is the azrog black and red themed gaming
orientated multiple and this time it's
on the x99 line and this time around
they've included a lot of features which
gamers would need other than LEDs and
even then they don't include the LEDs
they cut it out and they give you all
the functionality that you would want
from the next 99 motherboard so instead
of going over the full feature set of
this model but I'll talk about the main
features and how it differs from the x99
taichi which I recently reviewed so if
you wish to check that out I'll put a
link up here the first things first with
the CPU power you get a 12 phase power
design there which I believe is an eight
plus four players power design with
eight players is being dedicated to CPU
and then four phases being dedicated to
both sides of the memory there the
memory does allow to a 3.3 gigahertz
officially supported overclock on your
memory so overclockers will have no
problems with this motherboard I also
managed to get around 4.5 gigahertz on
my58 20k when using this motherboard and
the temperatures were pretty stable on
the VRM although they were getting a
little bit warm another important
feature to notice that this motherboard
does have support for those x99 Xeon
Engineering samples which you can pick
up a cheap off eBay namely the 2670 v3
which is a 12 core has well there goes
up pretty high some of the cool features
on this motherboard include a power and
reset button located on board the
motherboard which the taichi does not
actually have this is a great feature if
you're using as a test bench which I
usually do like to use with my
motherboards alongside that there's two
MDOT two slots there which should pull
up to five different configurations of
em two drives and then besides that you
get three PCI Express 16 slots there
which have as rocks still armored and
now this will support up to 3-way SLI or
crossfire depending on your CPU in
different configurations moving down the
board there you get the BIOS readout and
you also get the black and red heat
sinks on both the top and bottom and on
the left side you get the black armor
which covers your USB ports on the side
there and also the Sound Blaster cinema
3 which essentially is a real tech
interface with a Sound Blaster cinema 3
utility
add it on moving alongside the back of
the board a you've got the fatality
Mouse port which supports high polling
rates for any type of USB hardware
keyboard or mouse below that you get
their Wireless support there a doe 2.11
ACC and also supports bluetooth and then
below that you've got support for USB
3.1 in type C and type A configurations
and then even further below that you get
support module ni C's from Intel there
so you look at the boss this is one
thing I love about as ROC they know how
to do biases and they know how to do
them properly especially nowadays with
this x99 line you get both the simple
UEFI boss there which you can do
everything from one menu or if you press
f6 which is what I like personally you
can go into advanced mode and then
change around all the nooks and crannies
and get the perfect overclock for your
CPU
she sells SSD shells by the Micro Center
store he sells aliens that where alien
where by the Dell store big bada boom
for the base so in conclusion the x99
gaming i7 fatality from asrock is
another solid offering now I was gonna
do this review a little bit earlier
however I did come into some problems
with PCIe connectivity with my graphics
card over the first and second slots
there and that also extended when I
loaded it up with the third slot in the
windows with my n I see also not working
on a particular updated bar so something
weird was going on there it was a faulty
motherboard in the end because they sent
me out a replacement and now that's
working perfectly fine it's also running
and humming very well though with that
out of the way I simply love what asrock
are doing with their motherboards
they're simply offering value for money
they're offering all the features and
functionality that you could want from a
motherboard and going away with things
that you don't need like LED strips
which you can buy yourself and put in
and going with things like Wireless
julienne ICS solid on board audio and
you heard that mic input it speaks for
itself
very solid offering and especially when
you got that included xsplit license I
can actually see this motherboard living
up to that gaming title also another
thing that I failed to mention before in
this review is that the motherboard is
just a very solid board in general it's
got an 8 layer PCB there and that comes
through with the weight of this thing
you will not be afraid to bend or break
because it just simply won't bend or
break unless you put immense pressure on
it which is a good thing for as rock and
a good thing for x99 users because you
like to have good strong components so
lhasa let's talk about the pricing this
fatality i7 x99 board comes in at around
260 MSRP so it is about thirty to forty
dollars more expensive than the tai chi
that i reviewed but with that extra
money you get that xsplit license you
also get the power and reset buttons on
board the mother would and you also get
the black and red theme the fatality
Mouse port and the Sound Blaster cinema
3 utility support even though they both
the Tai Chi and the fatality have the
realtek sound support on there so I'm
kind of not sure what's going on exactly
there though are those extra features
worth the extra thirty to forty dollars
that's up to you to decide and whether
you truly need them or not me personally
I love what the Tai Chi has to offer I
love its price and I love its baseline
features and I quite simply love the
cosmetics of the Tai Chi's that see my
build here on the back so I wouldn't
really need the fatality if I was going
for a motherboard personally since I'll
be putting in a case so as a test bench
user
I simply love that power and reset
button board a buttons on side the board
so that's gonna help out when it comes
to benchmarking for you guys anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this review if you
did please give it a big thumbs up have
any questions or comments about the
Azeroth gaming i7 then be sure to drop a
comment in the comment section below and
I'll get back to you as soon as I can
and I'll catch you in the next Tech
video very soon
peace out for now bye first that you get
a 12 pack you also get the fatality
Mouse port on this which gives you very
hard piling ring ah Cheers as our gaming
i7 motherboard no I forgot he doesn't
