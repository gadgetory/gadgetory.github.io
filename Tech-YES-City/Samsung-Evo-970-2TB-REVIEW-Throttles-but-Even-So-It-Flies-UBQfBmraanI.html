we have the drive here we'll get the
gist of this review out of the way first
it's a simple 2 terabyte drive there's
also other flavors available one
terabyte and 500 gigabytes also 250 and
120 and those drives the one we've got
here is the two terabyte drives I'm
gonna be talking about this today this
comes in at just under 800 USD and in
Australia just over a thousand AUD so
it's a very expensive drive and with
that price tag you would expect
exceptional performance and it's a good
thing that this thing does perform
exceptionally well out of the box
however the weirdest thing is about this
drive is of course consistency the one
terabyte a SSD does come very close to
the advertised box speeds and in fact
it's getting so close to saturating the
maximum speeds available on pcie 3.0 x4
going on the read speeds going up to
around about 2800 megabytes per second
known the right space of two thousand
five hundred megabytes per second
however this is only with the one
gigabyte test over a SSD when we test
the 10 gigabyte variant in the tests
involved we see that not only did the I
ops drop and they were incredible though
going near 500,000 they drop to around
about 300,000 when you put a 10 gigabyte
stress test through it and not only that
the speeds on the right side of things
do drop significantly too so furthermore
I decided to put it through my very hard
hitting 100 gigabyte transfer tests with
mixed data patterns and this is when I
realized something was a little bit off
with this Drive after about 44 gigabytes
of transfer the right speeds
tank to near half that of what they
originally were now this is probably due
to Samsung introducing what they call
turbo right and they do promise up to 72
gigabytes on this variant the two
terabyte Evo
however after 44 gigabytes as I said in
this test in HD tune Pro the scores were
actually a lot worse than 17 gigabytes
was dropping at 44 gigabytes so the
consistency of this drive is a little
bit off and now this is actually very
important when it comes to an nvme Drive
if it was an entry-level SSD for the
consumer a very cheap budget drive I
wouldn't
here so much but this is an nvme
solution that people are buying for
productivity they're buying in a
professional work environment and it
needs to have consistent speeds Samsung
I would much rather see you drop those
initial burst speeds and somehow look
for a way to flatline those right speeds
so they're consistent all day every day
especially if you're someone like me who
edits 4k videos and one video project
can have easily over a hundred gigabytes
of storage to deal with and that's the
advantage of using an nvme Drive as a
scratch drive it's very fast it's very
efficient however that being said the
speeds that it throttles to is still
well over that of a gigabyte per second
so it is very fast to begin with when we
compare it to the MP 500 Drive from
Corsair it does still score better even
when it's throttled
keep in mind though the course MP 500 is
still a very consistent drive and keep
in mind the Corsair P 500 is actually
more expensive at current market rate
prices on at least on Amazon so it is
quite a compelling option the Samsung
970 evo even when it's throttled also
with the warranty it is pretty
impressive you do get a five-year
warranty with the 970 and also one
thousand two hundred terabytes written
for endurance
there's also encryption support as well
as their software The Magicians software
also the cloning software which in
practice does work extremely well
especially the cloning side of things
from clonic software this does an
excellent job if you want to quickly get
your old hard drive transferred to the
new SSD and enjoy those faster speeds
never even go to the temperature test I
test with a thermal image camera and
also test with the software itself the
ida 64 and also the thermal-imaging
camera results we're a little bit better
when the sticker was pulled off now I
have seen heavy stickers being
implemented on the MP 500 for example
well they do work efficiently well not
only for branding but also to dissipate
heat this sticker however I believe is
just insulating heat so it's not
actually optimal to have this sticker on
if you want the best performance with
your drive but anyway back to the
hardware in the package itself when you
get this drive it's just in a little
simple package it's encased pretty well
and then moving on with the hardware
they do have their own in-house Fenix
controller and they are using 64 layer
v9 flash this does enable them to double
the storage
pasady from previously one terabyte to
now two terabytes of storage so it is
actually a very small drive packing a
big punch but of course they are using
TLC memory as opposed to the pro version
which does use mlc based flash so if you
are to get those consistent speeds then
you may wish to step it up to the pro
variant of course there are other
competitors that are coming into the
field that are using mlc flash so it may
want to consider those if you want
better value for money
Samsung have always had that premium
speed and that slightly premium price so
here we are with the conclusion the
Samsung is a very fast drive even before
and after throttling of course I don't
like throttling if it's something that
Samsung needs to work on its getting
their consistency right especially on an
nvme Drive definitely when it all comes
down to it five-year warranty just under
$800 for two terabytes of really fast
nvme storage really good additional
software to boot and also in Australia
just over a thousand AUD it is one of
those drives that will suit you very
well if you need those fast transfer
speeds and you also need that peace of
mind with the five-year warranty anyway
guys hope you enjoyed this review if you
didn't show to hit that like button and
I look forward to catching you in
another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
