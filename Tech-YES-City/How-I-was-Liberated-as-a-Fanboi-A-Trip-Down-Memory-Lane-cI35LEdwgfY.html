versus the Intel yes I am the doctor
I just got my PhD in curing fanboy ISM
oh you want me to make that pledge right
now to the tech wall right well I'm
gonna do it oh you guys saw that welcome
back to tech air city this is the doc
dr. easy coming back to you guys today
with a video I'm first of all I'm gonna
show you this one I'm gonna make the
pledge with this certificate I hereby
pledge to cure the tech world of famboy
isn't but before we get on with that I
am going to tell you about my history as
a big AMD fanboy and I'm gonna do it
over some gameplay with Heroes of
Newerth
and I'm gonna actually I think it's
recorded at 1440p so this will be my
first 1440p video anyway let's move on
to the gameplay and I'll talk about my
history and a couple of years ago some
things you know open my eyes and I'll
talk about that anyway let's move on to
the gameplay okay so let's talk about
and we're gonna do this over here is a
new earth this is a game that I love and
I enjoy and ultimately yeah it's about
what you enjoy and not abusing others
but I'll get onto that later but let's
talk about my fan boy ISM and how it was
cured and basically it all started when
I was 12 years old and I had a game
called Warcraft 2 and Warcraft 2 if you
guys didn't know was so good it came out
I think in 1996 or something like that
and it was just phenomenal I mean
Blizzard did a really good job with
Warcraft 2 and so after I played that I
was just left shocked because it was
such a good experience they really you
know it was it was better than anything
I'd played on the Super Nintendo even
though Zelda on the Super Nintendo was
really good
that was probably comparable but ever
since then I really looked at PCs and I
could think wow PC gaming is legit and
that was back in 1996 and at that time I
had a crap computer I mean consoles were
better I mean they were better than PCs
at that time and I had a I mean I had a
piece of crap computer that had like a
turbo button I mean you press the turbo
button I vaguely remember it was like a
turbo button and you press it and
put your computer from a hundred
megahertz to 133 or something suffice to
say it was always left on but after that
I managed to build my first computer in
2000 and that was an AMD CPU I think was
the case six K three or something like
that and it was at the titles it was
better value for money than Intel it was
faster than Intel and AMD were a really
good company in 2000 they were a solid
company they were just dedicated to
bringing the best architecture always
they were always a really honest company
they didn't do any of this marketing or
the septic so I call it deceptive
tactics until I think Intel is the
master of that but ultimately you know I
think every company is guilty of it now
not just Intel Intel AMD Nvidia they're
all using deceptive and that's what I
wanted to talk to you guys about mainly
the focus of this video is that I am no
longer a fanboy four years ago pretty
much it stopped no longer a fanboy of
any product or anything I'm gonna judge
a product on its price and its
performance and I think in the
performance thing I think there's a lot
of things that get overlooked but I'll
talk about that later let's get back
into the history side of things when I
was growing up I went on to the K 6 K 3
and then after that I had the XP the
Athlon XP I think was on the k7
architecture and then they had the K a
the Athlon like a 4000 x2 or something
and of xp2 and it was a 2 core processor
was a really good value for money
processor but that was my last AMD CPU
in 2005 because as you guys know in 2006
Intel released the Core 2 Duo and it
surprised everyone because it was just
it was really it was a huge improvement
over their previous architecture I think
they Pentium DS or some crap like that
they had some really bad CPUs coming out
but they released the Core 2 Duo and it
was just impressive it was really good
and so after that I kind of I I said ok
well my next CPU if AMD don't have the
best CPU out I'm gonna
I'm gonna basically switch to Intel in
basically 2005 2008 they had the q9 550
and I managed to see it on special with
a if I had a q9 550 I managed to sit on
special with the motherboard p5q from
the Zeus and 4 gigabytes of RAM I think
was like 350 bucks and I said I can't
ignore this I've got to upgrade even
though I hated it I didn't want to go
with into army
everyone knows back in 2006 2007 AMD I
mean they didn't just bring the better
architecture out they were crippling AMD
they were doing all these deals under
the radar with Dell and HP and stuff
like that and now I'm at forcing the
companies not like they're just offering
too attractive a deal so that the
companies wouldn't go with Andy and
basically they're just trying to cripple
AMD any way they could and I mean it
worked I mean but I don't think that was
just the problem with AMD I think AMD
also their company was in a bit of
disarray as well they had problems with
their architecture and they couldn't fix
it and I'm just getting frustrated a lot
of people quit back then I think in 2006
that was a real turning point for AMD
that as a company they sort of lost
their direction I think as of late
they're kind of getting it back I mean I
love what they're doing with the gaming
evolved thing that's the best thing that
they've done in the in the last couple
of years I think they focusing on making
games and getting games optimized for
their graphics cards is really good
mantle I'm yet I mean it's only one game
so I'm yet to seal their to do with that
but I mean definitely I used to love AMD
and it wasn't till I got the q9 550 so
let's get back on topic that I realized
that this architecture wow this is
fucking legit I mean the q9 550 was just
snappy it was everything so much better
than my 4000 x2 and I was just like wow
you know this is a big big difference it
was more of a difference than I went
from my x2 over my XP in my Athlon and I
couldn't ignore her at that stage of
like damn and at the time I was also a
big ATI fanboy and I had a in 2010 I
purchased a 58 50 because you know was
it got the rave reviews everyone said it
was the killer it
was the but one of the best value for
money graphs cards you could get and at
the time I'd played a lot of world
Walker after my friend he had a GTX 460
and you know the even though the game
was optimized for NVIDIA the AMD still
on the benchmarks called better fps and
anyway I went to my friend's house and
we both had q95 50s and he said look
play on my rig and I played on his rig
and I was always this this myth that
Nvidia cards were smoother than AMD
graphics cards and it's only recently
come to life that this myth was true I
mean that the whole frame rating issues
and everything that AMD had before 2013
sort of made me lose a little bit of
faith in the company but basically
they've fixed that which is all good but
back in 2010 I tried my friends Nvidia
graphics card I was like damn like this
you're right this is smoother what the
hell and so it wasn't until then I said
alright well the next card graphs gone
getting is gonna be a new video Graham's
card and I got a GTX 670 and games when
games have never been smoother like ever
since the GTX 670 I was like damn you
know I'm going to buy the best graphics
card for the money now and so when
recently as you guys know I went to
upgrade from a GTX 670 to a GTX 780 but
at the time while seriously considering
in r9 290 and it wasn't I mean if it
wasn't for AMD
stuffing up the r9 290 release I would
have got one I mean if they just let the
partners do their jobs and put their
aftermarket coolers on there I would
have had an online 290 because that's
what I'm all about now more about
getting value for money and I actually
enjoyed trying different architectures I
really enjoyed jumping on the AMD FX
8350 I mean until I think's the master
of it deceptive tactics Intel's the
master of deceptive it I mean I think
nowadays in the video and AMD as well I
definitely planned the Decepticon to age
to get over my fanboy as a mom now 28
years old and I'm gonna keep giving you
guys the best value for money
recommendations I'm gonna keep tech es
city always objective and that's what I
love doing it now because it's if I've
been liberated and so if you guys can
get liberated at an earlier age then
it's gonna be awesome because ultimately
we can cast aside fanboy ISM and work
together as a PC gaming community then
we're gonna be better as a whole I mean
look what's happening with the steam OS
the PC gaming community is growing are
all supporting steam OS we're getting
behind it and it's looking pretty damn
good
so far I mean this is to stop
microsoft's directx monopoly on the
market and so the more we get behind it
the more we're we're United instead of
arguing about petty things like AMD
versus the video the more we're gonna be
able to make demands and force these
companies to bring us competition
instead of just marketing and so I think
recently as you guys know I was talking
about performance and a lot of people
think that you know AMD do offer really
good FPS for the dollar and for me it
was like it's not just about FPS stuff
you guys haven't tried I mean when the
first one that I'm going to talk about
the GeForce experience but when the
GeForce experience first came out I was
just like damn this thing's a piece of
shit but actually recently I can start
to see what they're doing with it it's
actually looking really damn good
they've got a shadowplay integrated with
it they've got their shield software
with it it's actually a really
lightweight as well so I really like
what they're doing and so that's with
performance you've got to throw in other
things as well people like why you
always on an AMD and NVIDIA graphics
card nowadays and I kind of have to
defend myself by saying because the
experience is so damn good for the money
I mean I games
I'll never crash on me things never
crash on me with this graphics card on
this CPU so I have to say that
experience for me is a big factor now
it's not just about the broad FPS and so
I mean I'd love to try
AMD's new graphics cards and however
until that day I'm gonna be on mind
telling the video ring I'm gonna be
enjoying it and so if people are gonna
call me a fanboy for having an Intel
Nvidia Rig then
I think I'm not the one with the fanboy
problem so anyway ultimately I hope you
guys enjoyed this and I'm not gonna stop
recommending products from all three
companies in the video Intel and AMD
because they all offer great price
performance products it's in different
scenarios and especially if you get them
on special they'll always look for deals
I always do as well I mean I got my GTX
780 Lightning for 480 US delivered to
Japan like it was an absolute bargain so
you guys would keep on the lookout for
deals and when you find them just snap
and pull the trigger
that's how you do it so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this big vlog and
ultimately I enjoy objective feedback as
well but I want to lastly I mean I know
it's sort of it's a bit how to say
contradictive of fanboys but I also like
subjectivity as well I mean as long as
it's print presented in the right way
right as long as you're not abusing
people or insulting people but so
subjective feedback is really good
because it's this is same subjective
feedback ultimately that caused AMD it
will caused other people to look further
into the AMD frame rating issue because
everyone wanted to test this myth is
aimed as Nvidia smoother than AMD and it
was this subjective opinion that
everyone had a lot of subjective
opinions that made people test the AMD
graphics cards and actually find out
that there was a problem so I really
respect that I really think that was a
cool thing that the you know that that
was something that subjectivity brought
out so anyway ultimately I like I like
both objective opinions and subjective
opinions so you know keep it flowing
guys as long as it's you know an
intelligent discussion then it's always
gonna get a thumbs-up and it's always
gonna be awesome to just to talk about
things with you guys anyway I've been
mumbling on for too long and I will
catch you guys in the next UK budget
build very soon but until then the dark
doctor ez is signing out and I'll catch
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
