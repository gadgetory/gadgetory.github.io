extreme for version 1.2 I'm just going
to try and overclock this video so I
haven't overclocked for actually like
three years so I'm on water cooling on a
sip water cool earth absolutes 290
that's the model name
basically when I overclock I like to
okay I'm going to leave it on 34
I'm not going to overclock first I'm
going to find out what my processor is
like so basically when you get a
processor you have different kinds of
processes some are better than others
even though they're the same model so
basically this one I'm going to find out
how good it is basically so where is my
this is my first time even just looking
in these settings so try to find my
voltage settings CPU voltage there we
are so let's um fixed mode well okay
okay
fixed voltage let's try that so let's
try and take it down 2.9 just to see if
it runs right um fixed mode yeah let's
give this guys what I remember I haven't
used it for a while so we've got CPU
voltage at 0.9 volts at stock speeds so
let's give this a go see if it even
boots up
well it's booting but I think it is
unstable no it's actually building at
point nine volts which they actually is
the first time running it in maximum
heat power some sunshine yet that's the
one we'll get and you know so we clocked
at normal speeds and we are just
basically finding out we're at normal
speeds and see the voltage there 0.85 so
it's actually looking like this
processor is automatically a I got a
pretty good run of the dye so looks like
it's pretty good
I'm under clocked at point eight five
six volts at three point four gigahertz
at the moment so that's positive that's
pretty positive um now I'm going to pray
and keep taking it down until I get
there basically until it crashes and
that'll show me where my minimum sort of
voltages at stock speeds so let's get
core temp loaded give you a look what my
calls are at so in core temp I am
getting this is running the stress test
so obviously I opened core temp before
or like after the stress testing so
obviously this is load temps at the
moment so maximum I gots 47 degrees
Celsius load temp so yeah okay I'll just
kind of quickly I'm just going to keep
testing it so keep testing this computer
and basically yeah find out where the
lowest level is and then from there what
I'm going to do is find out I want about
a 4.2 gig ahead of o'clock I'm not too
keen to overclock to four and a half
just yet because of the fact that it's a
brand-new model Ivybridge
and I want to wait until other people
overclock to like four and a half and
stability issues and see how it goes so
I'm going to go for a four point two and
yeah probably I'm aiming looks of this
at the moment point eight five volt at
three point four gear
Kirk and I could do about 4.2 it 1.05 so
hopefully that's hoping so anyway I'm
gonna update this video we're going to
keep it like I'm going to edit it and
cut it in and out so yeah okay so we are
in BIOS and we are going for a 4.2
gigahertz overclock on the Ivy Bridge
so first off I'm just going to load the
folds up and basically I want to go
fixed mode level one load calibration
now the busy load line calibration if
you look at the graph that is exactly
does what it says so if you leave a
level one your voltage is not going to
drop down after the vehicle goes up or
loading off the loading so level once is
going to keep you at a fixed voltage
percent all the time and not see this is
the thing I don't know about IP bridge
yet I'm not too sure about the I GPU
voltage and what that should be honest
I'm going to leave that on all that for
now and we're going obviously we're
going to go for a 4.2 gigahertz
overclock so we'll go all cause I
recommend see you guys are not familiar
with this then do what I do because I'm
not familiar with it yet so I'm just
showing you guys right now we'll try to
open up core temp see what the idle is
so my now my temps are about yeah I got
a different call one is maxed out 36 so
my my spread of temperatures is a bit
different like got a bit of an imbalance
CPU but that who cares I'm not going for
super big overclocks anyway I'll do that
cpu-z
I'll show you guys what I'm at home at
4:00 yeah see it's underclocking
but the voltage isn't dropping at fixed
voltage will drop that up
we are back in BIOS and basically I
found it is stable at about one point
one six I mean sighs this stay at 4.2
gigahertz was stable at one point one
voltage roughly but auto actually sets
it all the way up to one point two five
so everything else is on auto load like
CPU load line calibration zon level one
I found that to be the best setting for
me we're going to do CPU voltage offset
now and we are going to minus point one
probably about one one for first yeah
makes that sense point one for maybe
point one five will try and we just
stuff around with that and save that and
let's give that a boot
obviously your clocks are going to be
different to mine but I'm just showing
you what settings I'm tweaking with so I
might go for higher and when it gets to
winter I might try for some higher
clocks but I'm pretty comfortable floor
point two at the moment save an expert
and see how we go
love you
and we're loadings so far so good
nope nope nope I have to change it again
okay so I'm just going to tuile it
around with okay now we've done the
offset now so we're in running Prime for
workers maximum heat you know the second
test and I am getting heat of about 66
degrees max and I'm getting at the
moment 4.2 gigahertz at 1.12 voltage so
that's an offset for me of 0.12 I
actually found this a sweet spot of
about 0.12 not negative minus 0.12
offset for me so and then if I stop the
tests it shall go she'll go all the way
down to 0.8 at 1600 0.7 it's a bit
erratic but it's going down to 1600
megahertz and pretty low voltage so
that's me guys that's my 4.2 gigahertz
overclock if you got any questions leave
in the comments below
um if you have course subscribe get
Brian easygoing but yeah that's um
that's my results at the moment I'm not
going any higher and especially with
summer coming up and I don't really know
the Ivybridge
too much it's only just been released so
I'm at 4.2 gigahertz imma z77 extreme
for and yeah if you want to post your
overclocks person in the comments too so
I'm basically offset minus one point
sorry minus 0.12 and everything else is
auto except for core at all core at 42
multiplier so here guys it's my results
and I'm happy with that so yeah peace
out for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
