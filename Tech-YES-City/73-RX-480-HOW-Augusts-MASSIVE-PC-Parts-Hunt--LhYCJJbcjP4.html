month and we did some massive parts
hunts while all over the world we're in
Italy hit that up failed Austria was
amazing Japan good as always that we're
back in Australian were like okay we've
done the parts hunts technically for the
month but I thought to myself why stop
there
I mean I love doing this so we're gonna
give you guys another parts on this
month let's get into it we've got some
deals to go pick up right now we're
heading off to Brisbane because there
are some deals to chuck in not only a
big van I'm going with the king of the
coast but I've also picked up a deal for
900 Ozzy dollars for a PC with an i7 16
gigabytes of RAM and a gtx 1070 I think
this RTX announcement may already be
flowing through and the deals are just
there to be had
so got back and we got a heap of deals
also picked up the PC it is looking like
it's got a lot of potential but I'm
gonna check it out in the morning also
got a heap of monitors and some pcs as
well off less one of which I had to pull
apart already
cuz there was another order for a gaming
PC so it's just been crazy I'm gonna get
some sleep crash out and I'll catch you
guys in the morning
Oh we'll even if I have to come back
tomorrow and the next day so here we are
the next day and we've got three
Lenovo's I actually got four off flares
for about six hundred ninety dollars in
total so they have I 545 70s in them
they've also got the motherboards hard
drives this is a hard drive that I
pulled out this is an SS HD 500 gigabyte
let's also had an i5 6400 pick this off
for 120 AUD I actually need this piece
for another build and then of course he
gave us a monitor we got this for $40
because it had a little scratch on it so
that like and you can't even see it once
the monitors turned on so that's a 23
inch 1080p IPS display for 40 AUD
absolute bargains galore here but behind
it is the real prize this is the $900
AUD pieces of a go with the gtx 1070
really good power supply i 747 90 k 60
watts of ram 360 ml right at the top
tempered glass case we're really going
to make a separate video for this
because it's one of those metas that
doesn't go away especially with the RT x
mm
cases and pcs like this are going to be
going on sale because just people want
to just buy new everything and so you
can pick up an absolute bug we're going
to show you how dirty this thing is now
and what we're going to turn it into
before we flip it
anyway they I'm fun to charge I had to
quickly clean up the tackiest studio it
was getting to be really messy again but
we've found another deal and this is on
gumtree I haven't had time to call this
person this is a rx 580 sapphire nitro 8
gigabyte edition for 230 AUD so he's
accepted my offer
clearly popped in an offer because there
was no number to call anyway and now
he's texted me with the address and time
and I'm going to go get it right now
because it's actually a really good deal
at that price and then when we get back
we'll try and pull up some other deals
see what we can get and maybe even put
on that bogan accent since a lot of you
guys have been requesting now
so we've pulled up a heap of deals now
and there's two deals that I'm mainly
interested in that I have a good chance
of getting and they've got numbers there
so I'm gonna call these immediately and
that is a gtx 1066 gigabytes tricks
they're asking a 290 AUD for it and then
there's also a gtx 1070 for 420 so i'll
probably call this first with an offer
of say 380 if I can get that that'll be
around 270 US which is an absolute
bargain for a 1070 so let's get on the
phone okay so they didn't pick up that
phone but I just sent them a text
message so hopefully they reply pretty
soon let's get the GTX 1060 on the phone
though okay so they didn't pick up their
phone again let's try and get another
deal here on the phone because I know
you guys want to hear the bogan okay so
I sent Tom a message he had two kits of
memory available 16gb by a kid of ddr3
and also an Iggy bye kid and what I
wanted to offer him was if I bought his
six thank you bike it would he throw in
the end gigabytes for free and then
that's pretty fair price I do need ddr3
memory and that would make it a pretty
good deal so next up here we've got a
gtx 980ti and this is actually really
good because they've custom mounted a
280 mm meter Corsair water cooler to it
so you've got the graphics card but you
also got the cooler kit and the cooler
itself so you're getting a lot of value
out of this graphics card it will
perform really well a lot better than a
standard 980 I and also they're only
asking 380 au 350 sorry AUD for this
card so if we pick this up it's a
bargain even at the asking price I don't
usually pay asking price but this is
worth it and I do have a friend in
Brisbane that could pick this up if I
score this deal so let's give it a call
hello is this Tim with the 980ti from
Gumtree yep
I made I have you still got it
hello yeah so here you might have you
still got this one I do yes you could I
come pick her up today maybe in the
afternoon like a little bit later say 4
o'clock or something would that be wrong
yeah that's fun I'll just text you the
address and then just give me a
forwarding to do thanks mate sounds
great ok see it Tim why mate hey man I
don't know if he knew if he knew the
bogan or not that was a pretty weird
light you just pause and he's like he
probably thought maybe it was the bogan
from GAM tree I don't know anyway we
scored that deal 350 is still got it I
don't know if I'll be picking it up
exactly I'm not too sure I got to work
things out but even at 350 a VD it's
really good so maybe we can piece
together some other deals while we're up
there and go for a big drive it always
seems like the good deals are always a
big drive away but anyway so next up
we're gonna pull up some deals that I'm
really not too keen on but I'll just
drop off is on anyway because I'm gonna
go in lower and these are kind of low
balls cuz they're approaching Half Price
so gtx 745 a 4 gigabyte little
interesting card I do want to check this
out so I dropped in $20 I think it
performs similar to a GT 1030 but at 20
bucks that's certainly one cheap GT 1030
a mining setup now they're asking way
too much for this you go 7 graphics
cards are x5 80s and a couple of other
power suppliers I mean I might just
offer them in 1550s about the max I
would go because it does have the
rmx-1000 watt power supplies and you'll
be getting an rx 584 about 200 of pop I
mean I don't know if they would even
bother accepting that but that's about
all I'm willing to pay so especially
since their mind cards and then you know
the other gear would kind of make up the
rest of that crux same here we've got
like our x5 70s with with extra gear on
top so I'm not really too sure what the
deal is here I know
they've paid a lot 2,900 but because the
market says so
a thousand bucks is all I'm willing to
offer so I know some of these people are
gonna be like no probably not but then
after a while they might consider the
offer and say hey I might take it if
it's the highest offer available so next
time people got a 90 to 90 I do like the
cooler on this is the direct see you -
and the iron 290 still does get up and
boogie in 2018 170 seems like about a
good price maybe before the only offer
that he has he will probably accept that
also another mention that's a little bit
too far away as a GTX 760 in Toowoomba
for $60 that's a really good price I'd
even pay asking price at that this is
dirt cheap there's also an online 390
but you're going to drop in a 184 see if
they keen on that and lastly as an RX
480 a gigabyte g1 gaming so if we pick
that up for 180
that'll be definitely worth it so now a
little bit of an update before we get
going rx 480 is confirmed 180 Australian
dollars the guy got back to me I'm gonna
go pick that up soon also around that
area there's a Lenovo ThinkCentre with
an i-5 2400 a gigabytes of RAM some good
specs in it I got that for a hundred and
forty AUD so I'm gonna go pick that up
as well
we've got the 980 TI he never messaged
me back so I don't know what's going on
there but we've got two good deals gonna
go pick them up also some of the other
people as well with the RAM and also
some of the mining deals they got back
to me and they were kind of like not
interested at all with my offers so
nonetheless I let's go get these deals
so here we are we just got back from
that drive from South Brisbane and the
garden 980ti just never got back to me
so I guess he doesn't like the bogan but
what we got here is a 180 AUD RX 488
gigabyte bargain but the best thing
about it was he also had one more when I
rocked up and he only wanted $100
because it had no input output shit I
was like man I'll take that straight
away so absolute bargain completely
scored there and then we had two power
supplies he also had two power supplies
a $30 each so - 750 watt corsair power
supplies I was like man I'll take them
absolutely no problems because one
Australian dollar is a lot weaker than a
US dollar so everything I'm talking
about here is Aussie dollars and then of
course we've got that earlier today and
then we have a Lenovo PC here as well we
picked this up for a hundred and forty
dollars and it's got I five a gigabytes
around one terabyte hard drive I think
we can't use the model board because
it's like BTX but even then all the
stuff inside is pretty juicy especially
consider where pain I was used for it so
last thing is king of the coast he also
picked up a deal we met up with a viewer
as well that was really cool awesome
meeting up yes sir all will be revealed
soon but that particular person knows
who the king of the coast is now but
yeah he also gave us a stick of ddr4
memory for nothing and an LED strip I
mean who doesn't like an LED strip but
here it all is here guys I'll put this
whole tally of how much I spent on all
this stuff here on the desk on a total
for the screen and because it's just off
the memory wears so many different deals
it's just so hard to piece it together
here but off the top of my head I would
have paid I'm guessing close to $2,000
for all this Australian dollars but
again it's just so much value here on
the table it's unbelievable but it's
been a massive whole this month I hope
you guys have enjoyed this one and I'm
getting a lot of comments about my hair
yes I will get a haircut very soon
people are worried about me being tired
and looking like I'm just completely
worn out or I went partying and for five
nights in a row or something and I'm on
a bender and then I'm making videos no I
mean I've have
heard that from anyone in real life
everyone says I'm looking good I'm
feeling I'm feeling good
so this shouldn't be anything wrong with
the contest anyway I hope you guys have
enjoyed this one if you did then be sure
to hit that like button and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon also
let us know in the description below
what was your favorite deal in today's
news PC parts hunt and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
