the yester series where you guys ask
questions and I try to answer them as
best as possible for example this first
question is overclocking mspaint safe
and I'm pretty sure it is your mileage
may vary but one thing I do like about
mspaint is that I actually use it
sometimes to resize a lot of my images
especially coming from Photoshop where
some of these images can come out at
like 15 megabytes and they come out as a
PNG form and you just drop them into
paint and then yuri save as a JPEG and
it drops it down to like 250 kilobytes
so you can then avoid some of those
maximum upload limits on a lot of
different sites so mspaint
still it's not too bad next question we
got up here is is doing surgery on a
grape safe depends on the grape my
friend depends on the grape
next up here we have Ricki V says hey
Brian I've always wondered about your
comparison of us a verse
ozzie prices maybe discuss that on your
next check yes answers video other than
that good info here I want to see car
videos broom vroom so car videos I will
try and release something maybe at
Christmas time but in terms of Ozzie vs.
USA pricing I think they're pretty
similar a lot nowadays we talked about
the tax structure some places in the
u.s. I believe you don't have to pay
taxes and then as variable tax rates
which aren't actually charged on to the
final price that you see sometimes then
you go into the checkout and you've got
to pay those extra taxes in Oz
everything on pricing has to include GST
if it's a new shop retailer selling a
graphics card for example and I do like
this law better in Australia because at
least you know exactly what you're gonna
pay before you check out and you can
kind of gauge prices in terms of use
parts you don't have to pay GST on that
because obviously a lot of people are
just selling stuff in their back yard
but when it comes to place like Japan
for example they currently have an 8
percent tax rate and I think that's
moving up to like 10 percent in 2019 and
the problem with Japan for example is
they don't charge tax on anything until
you get to the final price so they
advertise all the prices without tax and
so if you're a foreigner and you go over
there you're like wow this stuff is so
cheap and then you get slugged with 8%
on the end bill and it sort of brings
the tech to around the same level so in
terms of Aussie vs. u.s. pricing always
just convert your money 1 USD to AUD and
you'll find out roughly how much that is
in comparative terms because at least on
face value a lot of the stuff looks
cheaper in the States but when you
convert it ah see pricing isn't too bad
a purchase that virtually mint hpz 400
for 200 euro shipped it's the six ramp
slut version and comes with six four
gigabyte sticks installed storage was
taken out but otherwise everything
appears to be a am I'll be out of the
country for a few months but I'll have a
Zeon W 30 680 waiting for me when I get
back and since you've made it this far
did you know the z400 was available with
an all-in-one CPU water cooler and it
seems to be the cooling the current CPU
just fine with its
rather quiet system I haven't done any
stress test but so far the CPU pulled a
reported 144 watts and hasn't even hit
the mid 50s so I actually didn't know
about this water cooler thanks for
sharing that with me I love sort of
seeing cool stuff like that in terms of
the z400 I believe those motherboards
inside a locked down so you won't be
able to overclock your cpu at least from
as far as I know so you do want to in
that case get the highest multiplier CPU
you can buy and try maybe stack it up
with value for money so the W 3680 is
definitely a good choice and then put
that water cooler on there and have
happy days I have dealt with Z for
hundreds in the past and usually Oh what
I'll do is I'll just put a decent GPU in
because the motherboards support all
those different graphics cards without a
secure boot or whatever and then I'll
put in like an i7 960 or 950 that I have
lying around that a lot of people pretty
much give away and you get yourself a
really good gaming PC especially on a
budget next up Lucas Peugeot he says
Brian I've seen a post in the internet
about editing biases on old 60 series
Intel chipsets so that's like the h-60
one and stuff to allow the motherboard
to boot from the PCIe slot and recognize
nvme SSDs could you make a video about
that it'd be nice to use nvme SSDs and
all the systems that don't support it
natively I just watched your video is
x58 still relevant 2018 and you
mentioned PCIe will solve every problem
that's why I'm asking that thanks and
events great vids and so in terms of
booting off nvme it's definitely
possible on my x79 zeus board i'm using
a two terabyte evo and that's the boot
drive and it works absolutely flawless
that's absolutely amazing but I did have
to go get a hacked BIOS from a forum
from someone who made that up in terms
of programming the bias itself I'd have
to learn how to do that and add in the
nvme options it could be a little bit
more difficult depending on the BIOS
maker and the motherboard in question
but it's definitely possible to do that
just depends on how you're going to get
that BIOS on that motherboard and
whether it's going to work a hundred
percent with no faults but in terms of
breathing life back into these older
chipsets definitely I think x79 at the
moment for example is a real big sweet
spot having no disadvantages compared to
the newer architecture
and still giving such good performance
next up here mike lounder he's following
up from the previous episode where he
said the 10 series had a problem with an
update that messed up the display ports
it's a bios fix so I'm guessing you
update the VGA bios and that may help
with your problem in the previous
episode where the person was having some
DisplayPort issues I mentioned another
suggestion which is one that I'm
personally coming into a problem where
the ports themselves from mining they've
sort of got a little bit of rust on them
so wd-40 and just keep reinserting that
cable and it fixes it absolutely no
problems next up here Caesar until he
says how can you say your ex 79 is your
main editing rig when you have other
than your hardware isn't it just months
ago you showed videos of two thousand
nine hundred thread rippers eighth and
ninth gen Intel's current second gen
rising stuff maybe just like really old
systems but would you rather prefer the
modern and capable hardware to what you
currently have right now
so this is a question I knew I was gonna
get asked a sooner or later and it
relates to a few different things the
first being the passion of the channel
and as I said written the travel video
put that up here if you haven't seen it
already everything I do on this channel
just relates to what I love doing
and hopefully you guys enjoy watching
the content too and part of that x79
thing is that I'd love use
price-performance it's just a big
passion of mine extracting the most out
of the older stuff and showing that you
really don't have to upgrade and waste
money on your hardware but at the same
time I do like testing out all the newer
stuff and seeing how it compares to the
older stuff as well not to mention the
companies they want their products
reviewed and they know that I'm more
than capable of reviewing those products
whether it be giving it fancy shiny
b-roll and then overclocking it and also
giving them feedback on their products
behind the scenes I do kind of beta test
especially for motherboard companies if
there's problems before they release
their motherboards I do let them know
hey fix this fix that before it comes to
market these are some really cool things
that go on with the new parts as well
and I guess in when it really comes down
to it they both need each other the new
parts market will always keep the used
price performance in check and also the
user
performance will always keep the new
parts in check so honestly it's just a
really cool trade-off one that just is
so balanced and I love being at the
forefront of that and also showing
people how to get those really good
deals that stuff it does really excite
me but also as well there's something
else and that is the ddr3 the low-caste
latencies I do believe it just makes
your system just that little bit
snappier if everything else is
considered and so that's something we're
going to be looking at soon with
thousand FPS camera testing the x79
versus the 99 hundred K versus the 2700
X Jarrod's Tex says I say is Zeus the
same way I spoke to someone who works
there and they noticed they pronounced
it the same no regrets
Jared's tech I love you right now next
up Deon Ellis says I like this set is
this the couch in the corner RGB
background lights look nice yes it is
the couch in the corner and just we
thought we'd do a little bit of a
different setup where we don't have to
rely on the condenser mica are causing
some little hissing and stuff like that
Plus yeah if you guys like it we'll
continue recording on this set here next
up the outsider of paradise says hey
tech why don't you just go to the
e-waste they're dumping iSeries
computers with ram nowadays very good
question i've tried in the past
especially on the Gold Coast I've tried
going around to different tips and it's
sad because they've got computers
sitting there like sometimes more than
10 computers sitting there and it really
frustrates me because apparently there's
this law now where you can't take those
computers and it's just like wow I mean
people can use those computers
especially people who don't have money
like younger teens and stuff who have
time on their hands could go pick those
things up and sort of just I guess try
and make a really cheap gaming PC so it
really sucks the laws at the moment
especially on in Queensland surrounding
a waste and it being able to pick up
those computers from the scrap yard I
don't know what other countries and
their laws are like I've definitely
heard some people in the US have been
getting some really good deals at a
waste centers because some of those
centers will actually resell the parts
at really low prices so I'm looking
forward to finding a place
that does sort of do reselling I have
had some people email me from interstate
saying that they've got parts and they
could wholesale them to me and stuff
like that but in terms of me doing
videos locally maybe if I can get some
special license or something that
definitely be something I'd look into
next up Chuck's zeal says can't wait for
the water cooling vids bud been flipping
pcs for years myself and as you can
guess I tend to lean more to previous
gen pots in turn you can find really
good water cooling gear secondhand for
the older PC part so I've finally
water-cooled all but two of my builds
with top notch gear from ek a danger den
Barrow to name a few and Barrow is
actually a really interesting company
they're on Aliexpress and they sort of
do I guess high-end water cooling parts
but without all those fancy brand names
associated with them so I'm definitely
looking into getting some Barrow parts
but that's RAM vrm CPUs GPUs and HD DS
no colored fluid just deionized water
with fazer based corrosion inhibitor and
PT new fireside and it's happy years not
really any maintenance needed before the
upgrade time and it's cool and quiet at
max OC so great value thanks for sharing
that tip I mean a lot of people have
problems with custom water cooling gear
and that they have to flush it out and
clean it every so often so I'm guessing
a lot of people who actually just want
to extract value for money out of water
cooling will definitely take that into
consideration I have to say that I'm
really liking the way AMD is going with
their new Zen and Navi series of chips
so it might be a new system for the
first time ever soon keep up the great
content buddy that take a break if you
need it
we like the honest upbeat vibes and stay
healthy thank you very much
and as for Rison yes I am looking
forward to the next seven nanometer
chips just as much as anyone else is
whether they're going to be the 16 cores
or 12 cores I honestly think they're
gonna be 12 cores
I don't think we're ready for 16 cores
just yet and this as I said in that
previous video I did I just think it's
too much too soon from AMD I mean what
are they gonna do after that they're not
just gonna put all their cards out on
the table when they don't need to so I
think a 12 core part if they release
that it would be so awesome I'd
personally
probably changed my main rig over to it
as well that's how much I'm looking
forward to it but in terms of AMD
they've definitely had a great year for
2018 with their CPUs GPUs is an absolute
mess I've been speaking to people behind
the scenes and the GPU market honestly
the cryptocurrency mining it's even
worse than I thought it was and I
thought it was really bad
so that's how bad cryptocurrency with
the GPUs has messed up the market at the
moment rage against the toy machine says
what are your thoughts on Walmart's new
overpowered line of gaming PC's I'm not
planning to buy one or anything I'm just
curious as to what your opinion on them
I call them overpriced my sentiments
exactly I've been taking a look at what
bit wet and gamers Nexus have been doing
with these things and they just look
like they're complete garbage for the
money yeah skimping out like 8700 on a
h3 10 I mean it's a little bit too much
like at least put a B 360 motherboard in
there please people deserve that if
they're getting an 8700 so there's just
you look at that you just like damn I
would not recommend this to anyone the
case looks like it's absolute garbage so
for the money they're charging I do
expect a lot better and since it's
Walmart I'm sure they could get some
real good economies of scale deals going
and give people some really good value
so it's just shame to see them go down
that route and say hey if you want a
gaming PC with fancy lights and an 8700
and a GTX or r-tx gravis card we've got
you covered except they don't have you
covered and they're preying on those
people that really I guess just walk
into Walmart and don't have a whole lot
of time they're on their smartphone
they're like oh this might be a decent
deal when it's actually not a decent
deal at all yes definitely overpriced
next up few years behind says on the
topic of Zeon's on I'll Express you can
find an e3 1280 v1 476 USD and a P 67
motherboard for $65 III 1280 is four
cores eight thread sandy and has clocked
to three point six gigs on all cores out
of the box with p67 chipset you can set
the maximum 39 multiplier to all cores
and it will give you 3.9 gigahertz and
then you can set bus speed a few
megahertz higher to say 105 and it will
give you 4.1 on pure performance 11 56
Zeon's are better but 4.1 easy overclock
on sandy just makes me happy that's
actually a really good tip thanks for
that few years behind because yeah if
you can get a four gigahertz overclock I
guess on a non overclockable CPU just by
a few tweaks then that's really good
value for money I love it when you can
find those motherboards with a
particular BIOS that allows you to hit
that max multiplier speed I know for
instance in the past when I've had a
Xeon I think it was the e3 1230 V to the
underappreciated there was a be 85 pro
gamer motherboard and you could set the
max multiplier as well only on one BIOS
so it's definitely cool what you can do
with a motherboard and Xeon combo in
terms of extracting performance next up
Farnley he says could you make a bill
with a core i7 4720 HQ compare it to the
normal 4770 I found it on turbo I'll
expressive China for $90 it has modded 2
years of the normal mode over like be 85
I think Linus already did a video on
that one it's the isn't that the laptop
CPU it looks pretty cool like I
definitely want to get that testing done
for you guys but there's just so much on
the plate at the moment so maybe next
year if we've got some time we'll take a
look at that for you guys but in terms
of what it is and sort of like the
practicality of it for the normal person
it is gonna be one of those more real
niche things
next up grow Tacoma he says I love my
gaming PC but I edit videos for my job
and fun fun for YouTube and I use a Mac
I edit with Final Cut Pro After Effects
and Premiere and never get crashes just
wish I could do tinkering on my imax
hardware speaking of Premiere Pro and
crashing it's it's so crazy I mean it
just seems like every time Adobe
released an update there's some weird
thing that'll crash for instance we can
force Adobe to crash if we are set in
for instance a constant power on the
audio and drop that all the way to zero
and we can just replicate this easy and
bang Adobe crashes so definitely if
you're using Premiere Pro do me a favor
go to the autosave settings and set it
to at least
two minutes you'll thank me later next
up rebel without a clue says could you
look at om x58 next seven nine boards as
sometimes those deals pop up and the
cooling and BRM is in question along
with the overclock ability would be
interested due to you working on om
machines a fair bit we've actually got
an X 79 board that's come in this is
called the running and as always I just
check this stuff out you check the
feedback and there's one Russian guy in
there going hard is like yep this board
is the one to get a 5 16 50 v 2 and then
you get that 2 4 point 2 gigahertz with
some ECC registered memory this could be
the new meta for those people who want a
6 core 12 thread and living
internationally and can't get access to
Rison for example I'm definitely looking
at this combo at the moment and stay
tuned because it might be that REM board
is sort of the better of the boards
there I did take a look at the one and
board for the X 79 I thought that was
madessa to get on x79 to get that board
because it just didn't make any sense
this one on the other hand actually does
have quad channel memory next up are J
games he says I got a question I have an
Intel 9 ATX and EVGA classified x58
motherboard what would I gain from
upping to one of the new six core rise
in CPUs as to what I have now and that's
a really good question in itself but it
depends on what you're doing
if you've overclocked this CPU and
you've got a gtx 1070 for example and
all you do is play games i'd say there's
absolutely no reason to upgrade at all
but if you're doing things like Adobe
Premiere Pro the Rison 5 a 2600 when you
do overclock it you will get some gains
plus you'll get some better power
efficiency so whether you need the
productivity out of Rison or whether you
just need to keep it for gaming then
overclocked for gaming it'll perform
pretty similar to a Verizon 520 600 even
in 2018 if you want to check out more
between these two CPUs in terms of
gaming I'll put a link up here for you
guys
but also of course the rosin new series
has USB front out and all those fancy
features you'd get from newer chipsets
see of course that may be a factor as
well in terms of upgrading if you need
those new features
next up shampoo time says address the
yes question think you may have answered
this before but
do you do any local fan meet ups ups
public events store promos lands risky I
know with Internet crazies huh yeah yeah
it's funny yeah we do we were kind of
going to have a barbecue a while ago
it's just I've honestly just been super
busy it's been it's just too much but I
guess in ways when I think about that I
will be making a fan meeting probably
after Christmas maybe an end of January
that'd be great just all meet up on the
Gold Coast have a barbecue
have some drinks talk to you guys so
I'll definitely see what I can do in
terms of that and in terms of just the
busyness itself I guess the way I look
at it it's like hey I've sort of worked
on YouTube for so long it's been
actually and you guys as well I've been
so loyal to me that I don't want to let
you down now things are starting to go
pretty well so I was like I'm just gonna
put my foot to the floor on the
accelerator and just keep the awesome
content coming for you guys so if you've
got suggestions - be sure to drop a
comment below
next up god of sand says I bought a
black reference design ZOTAC GTX 1070 it
has a weird problem on my main rig where
neither the motherboard on Windows will
detect the GPU however have my late
uncle's PC and it works absolutely fine
on that machine the only conclusion I
can come to is that something is wrong
with the motherboard itself any
suggestions and yes it is the
motherboard and it's to do with secure
boot problems I definitely have come
into a lot of these headaches with OEM
boards like HP's and Dells for instance
and they just won't support in video
graphics cards to boot but if you can
get into the boss with a for instance an
old AMD card which I find usually works
on any single motherboard then you can
go into the secure boot options and try
and play around with those settings and
then change that and then try and put
your gtx 1070 back in and then see if it
boots up if it doesn't have that option
then unfortunately you're generally Sol
so yeah get another motherboard if
that's the case next time people got
quasi song he says great and awesome
content as always I have a question for
the next yes episode I have quite a lot
of headphones I'm weird
I like to keep them and not weird at all
man that's I guess you just may be an
audiophile they
consists of audio technica ath m20 a
venturi audition Logitech G 433 Razer
Electra and so on
but I'm wondering if buying and spending
money on an amp will be a good idea many
of them saying an imp will help us to
get the best out of these headphones
just wondering if they'll make any
difference for the headphones I have in
terms of the headphones you currently
have they do look like they're sort of
mid-range more budget orientated options
depends on what you're using at the
moment if you're using them with a
motherboard with good onboard audio for
example then you unfortunately won't get
much of a difference
now generally amps where they make the
biggest difference especially a DAC am
combo is when you've got higher-end
headphones that are harder to drive for
instance although dynamics but of course
they will make a little bit of a
difference and if you see yourself
definitely stepping it up in terms of
better headphones in the future than
getting a DAC amp solution now that's a
good one
is always an investment for the future
especially if you like listening to
music it's always a trade-off I guess
with anything like we've got pcs for
example match a good GPU with a good
power supply good CPU match a budget GPU
with the budget power supply and a
budget CPU I guess that's like the tiers
of PC parts you've got the tiers of
audio where you want to match all your
good gear and not have one really bad
link in the chain next I'd be a line of
truth ministries he says I love the
channel and your style very personable I
recently switched from Mac and built my
own PC and your channel has been a great
blessing my family and I spent a year in
Australia and your accent brings back
good vibes blessings a lot of truth
ministries thank you so much for this
comment it's the reason why I love doing
YouTube is just reading comments like
these I hope you have a Merry Christmas
and all the best
next up five falcon says could you
please do some more dual socket or quad
socket intel xeon AMD operatin or epic
videos actually I'm not too keen on
doing dual socket or even quad socket
videos because in the past I've used a
dual socket Z onboard as my main PC for
quite a while and its perks
were that of course it was great maximum
performance especially for the money but
the negatives were that there was
noticeable latency over a single
overclock
CPU and so that's why I went back to a
single socket solution because of those
issues plus there was other issues where
games wouldn't work properly some of the
time and the FPS was actually lower
compared to that too of a single CPU
variant of the same CPUs in dual socket
mode so in terms of me doing future
content with dual sockets I don't really
believe in it and I don't think the
majority of single and desktop users
especially power users that need to get
a lot of things done at once would
benefit from a dual socket CPU solution
next time gray wolf Chow says another
great video always gravity reform you
hope that thumb is healing well yeah it
is healing well I guess there's this
really weird bump of scar tissue and
it's actually really annoying to try and
use my thumb like I used it before I cut
it so if you guys have any good tips and
tricks that work well for reducing that
scar tissue then I'd love reading your
comments on that next up shower med says
hey Brian peter baelish mustache and
goatee how's that for an idea we can
always give it a go
thanks and that about wraps up this
episode of address the yes I hope you
guys enjoyed it if you did then be sure
