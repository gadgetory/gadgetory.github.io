of a different vlog and show you guys
behind the scenes of all the used parts
that have been building up around the
channel and damn there is quite a lot of
this stuff here so let's get through it
all
welcome back to the channel guys this is
brian coming to you guys today with a
little vlog where I'm just showing you
behind the scenes of what's been going
on with tech s city and as you probably
know if you've seen in the past I broke
my toes so that actually sent me back a
lot in terms of time because I had
bed-bound for a few days and even then
I'm pretty slow even now so it'd be
another couple of weeks until I'm fully
functional again but we've got here just
a lot of live what's been going on in
the last few weeks as I've found myself
having all these parts but not having
sort of extra parts to finish the build
so what I did was I ordered a heap of
different drives like hard drives off
the options
I ordered a heap of different coolers
heap of power supplies heap of cases and
so pretty much when I get like a
graphics card like this in which is like
a 69 70 and I go like saying for
instance a combo like the p55 I can then
just go and bang out a build for you
guys without having to worry about what
parts I need now the best part of all
this is probably over here this is kinda
like my special table this here is
actually going to be a bill that I'm
really looking forward to with the seven
nine seven T and the X 58 in the year
56:14 is going to be like the king of
price performance in my opinion going to
be doing that and I'm going to be doing
a giveaway for you guys so that's sort
of like the project that I'm really
lying off the money a lot of people want
to see this one as well this is the e
526 75th reasons the Haswell one I've
actually booted this up already so it is
confirmed working it works perfectly
with this motherboard I've just ordered
in some ram there which actually memory
prices are really cheap at the moment so
they're kind of like what they were
before that factory floor and all the
prices went up so it's actually a good
time to buy memory now and back there
we've got kind of like ddr3 memory which
I've just ordered in to find myself
needing a lot of that stuff as well over
there is kind of like a junk motherboard
I don't know why I've kept this but I
just have because I'm waiting on a BIOS
chip to come in so I can test it out and
see if it was the bias that was corrupt
on that motherboard from that previous
build in the past but anyway that's
what's been going on in this room I've
actually got some power supplies in the
work not checked so I figured you guys
would probably want to check in with me
and we'll see if these things are junk
or fun baby okay so here's the test bed
over here we actually got this 850 watt
power supply it's an Oran purse of the
gold rated power supply and now I'm
going to be hooking this up to my trusty
server board which I got for like 30
bucks I absolutely love this thing
because it's a pretty stop board and it
has all the beep codes built on so
doesn't it you don't need an extra
speaker it just reads it all out from
this thing here so awesome let's get on
with the tests all right look at that 12
all right four different lines there
with 25 days on each rail this thing go
to work all right so it's finally time
we're gonna switch this little bad boy
on now I actually didn't realize this
was another one that I ordered in I
don't know why this one got in faster I
guess the guys just really quick on his
shipping so that beep is a good sound we
didn't hear any popping but we're just
going to boot it up and see if it works
I think it's one of these pins I forget
which one it actually is one of these
pins boots it up and
so looks like it's working this is the a
spell interesting brand I've got it I
mean I vaguely remember this brand I
haven't heard of them lately so maybe
they went out of business but anyway we
get a signal out of the single wife as
soon as the signal comes on then we know
our power supply is pretty much good to
go you guys are just seeing this light
this is like behind-the-scenes stuff
this is how I usually test off so
nothing really much to hide here
it's got my little test bench over here
and you should be putting on that
shingle there is that took ages like
literally that took ages so next up here
we have a 500 watt power supply this is
from the a spell as well back bill it's
got 470 watts on the 12 volt one so I
like this I picked this up for around
about ten dollars but there's just one
little problem it's like when I smell it
it just smells a little bit off so
anyway let's just test it let's test it
out all right it's time for the moment
of truth with the a spell now hopefully
we hear the beep okay that's it that's a
good sound that's a good sound of you
let's just start this thing up
like I really forgot which pin it was I
remember I checked on the net but it's
one of these in the middle all right
cool
so yeah this power supply works I don't
know what the little smell was what that
was about but maybe it's just a new
power supply I mean if we look closely
like man it looks like it hasn't even
been used once so brand new like 500
watt power supply for ten bucks I'll
take I'll take that damn this monitor
takes a long time to play get out of
signal 2 so I'm hoping the signal comes
through soon but other it is cool all
right sweet this power supply works too
so yeah we've got to funks so far and no
junk now this was this motherboard that
I got completely hosed on I actually had
to seal it in this cabinet here because
it reached like it absolutely stank this
thing is a health hazard like a
legitimate health hazard and um I'm
actually going to go to the police when
I get some time and report this guy for
fraud because he didn't even like in his
auctions he didn't mention like at the
back of the board here it's severely
crisp and like it's toast there and when
I pulled this heatsink off it was mainly
actually back of the board as well there
is some serious damage to this modern
board just here as well I'm like he
actually put up photos of a new
motherboard for like one that had
absolutely
problems at all so ya gonna report this
guy so you know it's not always
appropriate thinking oh you get lucky
with the parts no like i get seriously
hosed some of the time
so I actually gotta close this thing up
because it just reeks oh my God look
what just came in the mail this is that
850 watt power supply that I was talking
about before I actually wasn't home when
it tried to come so we are gonna jump in
the car and we're gonna go get it
car locks actually got to turn the
exposure down damn it's like I mean why
doesn't man that's cool so I think the
exposures set just about the right level
and we're gonna talk about hardware for
you guys so GTX 780 I have put one on
bid so hopefully I'll win the bid and
then I'm gonna be doing that video for
you guys because I've got a heap of
archive benchmarks that I can
cross-reference and when I do that I'll
be able to tell you what it exactly is
going on with the drivers because I've
got the exact same settings I've got the
exact same levels and you know what I
mean all those settings are consistent
so I can pull them up and then I can
redo the benchmarks for you guys and
tell you what's exactly is going on
behind the scenes with Kepler as well as
the fact that I do want to test the GTX
780 in Premiere Pro because there's this
big rumor flying around it you know
they're supported the officially
supported cards work a lot better than
say your GTX 970 your maxwell base cards
so i'll be doing that test as well and
there's just so many tests to come that
i figured would you guys prefer if i
sort of lower the quality and get more
content out or just keep up that high
quality that I've been doing in the past
because it's just so hard because I you
know I spent hours and
was editing videos to get the look right
and if I can't get the look right then
you know the video is going to be
unprofessional so I don't know this is
why I wanted to vlog about it and sort
of talk to you guys directly and see
what you wanted to get out of the video
also another thing I wanted to talk
about was the upgraders edge I thought I
used to be diagnosed with that problem
like I thought that was my problem you
know I just had to constantly upgrade my
stuff otherwise I would feel like there
was something empty inside
however after doing these used builds I
have been feeding an addiction that has
been so satisfying that I don't think
it's the upgrade is it I just think it's
doing something different inch and you
know especially since I have been doing
things like downgrading technically
right I went from x99 to AC 602 for my
main rig and I've been loving that so
much more than x99 it's been so much
more fun to work with just something
different right the server motherboard
with all those different settings on
there so that's another video I'll be
getting done as well how to tune your C
602 chipset so stay tuned for that
the 851 cosplay the last thing I want to
talk about in the car was the direction
of the channel and where we've been
going lately Amanda views and subs have
been really aggressive lately it's been
explode and thank you guys a lot and you
know with that I'm sort of going to keep
that keeping a real attitude where I
just test things and I really don't care
what the internet says like for instance
like spreading pace with my finger I
know some people are against it and I
know there's all these reasons but I've
tested that and it's like the most
consistent method of spreading pace not
only does it save a lot of time but my
temperatures just always seem to be the
most consistent when of course I clean
my finger before I spread it but it's
just things like that you know then
there's other rumors on threads you
can't overclock ECC memory I'm having
some of the best results with ECC memory
I'm talking like mediocre over clocks on
the memory but when I'm doing that I'm
getting some really good results like
for instance on the server motherboard
we had memory from 2012 I think it was
ddr3 memory now this stuff is getting up
to 866 mega Hertz at 1.4 friggin volts
now that is incredible I've never really
heard about that especially for memory
made back in 2012 I was just blown away
anyway so that goes to show that you
know some of these things guys some of
these threads that are on the internet
are just full of like complete
so anyway that's sort of the things I'm
just going to keep testing and seeing of
course you can't overclock ECC memory
that much right there's going to be a
level where it just starts to get too
bit reading right errors and then just a
whole system or crap
so you've got to be wary of that when
you overclock is easy memory but when it
comes to like you know Lydell meteor
overgrowth clocks you can definitely get
a lot out of it also another thing about
ECC memory is you know it comes in two
forms registered and unregistered and I
found the registered portion does not
make a difference and in some
motherboards you can actually turn the
ECC portion of the memory off and that's
exactly what I did on the server memory
so I turned it off and that allowed me
to get up to eighteen hundred and sixty
six megahertz so that being said ddr3l
is actually really good bin memory
that's all it is so don't worry about it
being one point three five fold it's
really good stuff
so here is a place called coins home I
actually go here a little bit when I
need some little like hardware things
kind of like fittings or whatever I
actually got some of the parts
especially a brake cleaner actually got
some of the parts for the 650d case that
I did on the dual CPU build from here
some little hard things that allow me to
lock the case down on the right side or
the motherboard to the case however this
time around I'm just gonna get some
alcohol wipes because I've ran out so
let's go in and I mean what good would a
vlog be without a cabinet I mean come on
so here he is here have you ever met
like those people that like put on
different voices when they see animals
kind of like this yeah yeah that's my
sister guys she does that
so here it is this is the 851 and it's
called an Orem pro yeah that's what it's
called so it has 70 amps on the 12 volt
rail which is pretty damn good so let's
see if this thing works all right so
we're just about to get this thing
powered up and apparently we need a
proprietary power cable for this power
supply like what the actual is going on
here so we won't be able to test this
thing out today so it's kind of in but
in the middle between junk and funk it's
not a dunk and being like more like a
bug and here's the final stop of the
behind-the-scenes look here so I've got
here my x79
overclocked gigabyte motherboard now
this thing is insane is a great
motherboard you can see there it's
actually got two CPU eight pins there so
I'm gonna have a lot of fun with this
thing once I get a cooler slapped on it
and I bought a 16 gigabytes of ddr3
memory for around about 70 bucks so I'm
gonna see how that performs in
dual-channel when I test it against the
skylight 6600 K in dual channel because
I want to test that with mid-range cards
and just see how far we've come and
compares something sort of a similar
price something of similar price
actually this is a little bit cheaper
cuz I got the CPU for like 170 dollars
and also the motherboard 470 as opposed
to the CPU which cost like 280 alone so
anyway we'll be testing that I can't
wait to give you guys that this is the
zelmans e9 case that I picked up for
this is why I got this for 20 bucks I've
already cleaned it up as you can see
it's looking beautiful and we are going
to put all the parts in that and get
that
crack-a-lackin' so here's the actual old
set that I used to record on for you
guys you probably remember it's a blue
backdrop I actually still use it it's
just that it's been really cold in
winter so I kind of just wanted to stay
downstairs because I got the gas heater
down there and electrical power is just
so expensive in winter so yeah but as
there's a set there I'm actually
thinking depending on how this performs
in the sky like benchmarks I'm actually
thinking of selling it if this thing
comes close especially with the
mid-range graphics cards I'm probably
gonna sell that building so yeah it's
the downgrade as each baby and then
lastly here I've just got a review
sample of the creative over I've been
meaning to do this for a while I was
pretty much just going to get onto it
and then I broke my toes so that's gonna
be out in the next few days actually the
review of this so expect that really
soon so anyway that's about it for me
today guys if you liked this videos and
be sure to hit that like button and also
let me know what you guys think about
this vlog style it's sort of like a
great way for me to test things and sort
of relay things that are on my mind that
I couldn't otherwise do in a dedicated
video because it just look really weird
and it sort of digress from the topic
way too much so look forward to your
comments in the comment section below
and I'm also filming off this camera
that I actually picked up down the junk
store for like sixty percent of the
original price this is the WX 970m from
Panasonic so it's got image
stabilization it's 4k and I'm actually
using the onboard microphones to record
audio so I kind of wanted something
where I could get quick and easy shots
that wouldn't sort of stop my workflow
too much so let me know what you think
about the video quality as well so I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye
yeah guys this is a new thing on the
internet called I roll so in tacky-ass
city fashion we are not going to let the
power supply win we're going to change
over this proprietary crap with a
standard Jack and then we're going to
see if this power supply works ok so
I've just sold it on a different actual
power connector on the rear here so
we're gonna test if this power supply
actually works now alright so here we go
we're gonna turn this on now and you
know see if it works
Oh
that's a good sign so far I'm just going
to get my pair of scissors and try and
start this computer up now
all right let's hope this thing starts
up so this is the last part in our quest
for glory okay cool
the fan is spinning the fan is spinning
on this too and the thermal insulated
glove is on now can we get a signal
$50.00 power supply is complete funk so
he's gonna wake us again that's so the
board the weight is just gruesome it's a
painful almost it says ah it works
ladies and gentlemen the power supply is
working so we are good to go our $50 850
watt gold power supply the FSP Orem pro
is now perfect it's working job done
jobs done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
