skylake architecture for a hundred bucks
you may be wondering how and why well
let's answer those questions for you
guys when it subscriber informed me
about a $100 chip going on aliexpress it
was essentially an i7 skylake
engineering sample I immediately
purchased one and then started doing a
lot of research about the chip there
were two chips in main supply with the
codenames
qh 8 g the one that i purchased and qhq
g which is a little more expensive
both have base clocks of 2.2 gigahertz
so that isn't a problem on any z170
motherboard that can overclock by the
base clock however the qh8 g code name
chip features a zero stepping in other
words it is the first production run of
these chips it is so infant in
production in fact that it has the I GPU
portion disabled and also runs up to PC
a 2.0 only reiterations before this qh8
e and q HAF are rumored to not work on
any consumer motherboards at all the qhq
g chip however is q0 stepping and has
the a GPU enabled and also has CCA 3.0
so not only will it overclock better
since it is a leader revision but it
also has more features enabled and will
also work with many more motherboards
and biases hence the higher price though
for a bargain hunter like myself the
$100 qh8 G was very appealing after all
I always loved me a good bargain
so after delving into the depths of many
Google translated Russian forums I
finally stumbled upon a link to a Korean
website that was in Korean that had all
the biases which supported the skylake
Engineering sample chips and from there
I bought a motherboard listed on this
website the azrog v 170 proof 4 after
getting this board home I updated or for
better lack of the term back dated the
bastard version 2.8 and lo and behold
the chip booted up and we were now good
to go
but one thing to keep strongly in mind
is that although this chip works on my
motherboard I'm not sure what
motherboard and bass combinations this
or other engineering sample will
pacifically work on though I will put
some links in the description
for you guys and after I started
overclocking this chip I managed to get
it to around three point five five
gigahertz stable at one point three nine
volts via base clock overclocking and
you are probably wondering this is very
low compared to any retail i7 skylake or
cable a chip and that is very true when
we heard about intel delaying their 14
nanometer architecture back in 2013 this
chip here is the exact reason why if
Intel were to release a processor that
could not overclock anywhere near its
predecessor the i7 4790k then they would
become the complete laughingstock of the
tech world though tech enthusiasts even
caught a glimpse of this phenomena on
the Broadwell II versa haswell-e chip
that is most 5820k CPUs will overclock
higher than 6,800 K CPUs making many
architectural improvements virtually no
land void to the end-user so how does
this 100-dollar i7 at three point five
five gigahertz compare versus an i7 7700
K at five point one gigahertz let's find
out
so with my 980ti overclocked to the
brink both these CPUs at 1080p performed
extremely well there wasn't much of a
difference there to be honest and even
running some multiplayer tests in
battlefield one both these cards handled
the overclocked 980ti with no problems
whatsoever and if going up to higher
resolutions is your thing then there's
going to be even less of a difference
ultimately though this chip is a bargain
so you will have to know how to
overclock and be aware that this will
only work with a certain number of
motherboards and within that a certain
bias reiteration also I'm sure there
will be a lot of people that will say
that you can't sell engineering samples
and that may be true though I'm not sure
on the rules there as I quite simply
have not entered into any agreements
with Intel and in Australia where I live
there are no federal laws regarding
Intel CPUs unlike weapons and drugs for
example this means that for most
consumers purchasing one of these CPUs
should be absolutely fine though again
your mileage may vary and lovely is for
the awesome viewers who let us know
about CPUs like this one thank you guys
so much I love getting these things in
researching and then sharing this video
with you guys so if you like this video
then be sure to leave us a like if you
dislike the video - then be sure to slam
that dislike button and let us know in
the comment section below what do you
think of the 100-dollar i7 would love to
hear your thoughts and opinions as
always and if you want to know more
information about this cpu then be sure
to head over to the tech city forums WWH
cdtv slash formed and there'll be a
whole thread on there where you can find
out more information about this CPU
anyway guys I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
