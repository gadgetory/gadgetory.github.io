is a little bit of a weird one because
this is a Z 390 motherboard and it's
coming out a while after XIII 90s
already released and I was put under NDA
for it so if that gives you any
indication then maybe Intel's refreshing
chips this year so yeah there's that but
anyway as work with this board this is
the phantom gaming seven they have the
ascetics pretty much the main focus and
it's pretty interesting because they've
got the input/output shield pre-attached
now to the board itself and I must admit
this is a trend that is welcomed in the
industry I do like this personally it
makes it look clean
makes it look flush and when you install
it you don't have to worry about
forgetting IO shields honestly the
amount of use builds I've come in to
where the people don't include the IO
shield when they sell the motherboard is
so numerous and this will definitely
eliminate that problem for future
generations of used PC parts hustlers
but with that aside as with any tech yes
city motherboard review will go from top
to bottom with this thing starting with
the vrm and here they're using a PWM
controller known as the Intersil is l69
one three eight with the MAS driver
being the Intersil six six one seven
eight for the actual vrm power phases
they're going with an eight plus two
phase power design where the eight
phases are doubled and for the high and
low side MOSFETs they're using vishay
SSC six three four
and also si si six five four MOSFETs for
the chokes we've got magic sixty AB
chokes and then our capacitors we've got
twelve K's from Nietzsche con this is
attached to a heatsink that weighs in at
about a hundred and sixty six grams
though when I put my ninety nine hundred
K to five gigahertz at one point three
six volt and yes I know a lot of you
guys in the comments are telling me
about how your ninety nine hundred K
gets the five gigahertz at a lot lower
voltages this is an NGO sample and it
did kind of lose the silicon lottery
can't even boot at five point one
gigahertz so it's a good thing for
testing multiple VRMs however because it
is like a worst case scenario and in
this case mine will juice over a hundred
and eighty watts have five gigahertz and
this in turn will stress the V RMS so I
was happy to report that it did pass
this stress test the V RMS however did
get a little bit uncomfortably hot as I
would say I like to keep it down
under 90 degrees for the surface
temperatures when I put the IR camera
over it this was going up to 98 max with
a 25 degree C ambient environment the
heat sink is doing a great job with that
getting the 72 degrees C so if you do
put a fan over it it will cool extremely
well so the V RMS decent will handle a 5
gigahertz overclocked off your more
serious about overclocking may wish to
consider the Taichi or the phantom
gaming 9 which comes equipped with a
better vrm then moving on to the onboard
audio this was very interesting because
this is I keep saying in every review is
like usually yeah well on board alia
keeps getting better and better this
does have a slight improvement but there
was a catch there using the realtek ALC
12:20 solution though does require a
creative driver to get it to function at
100% so if you don't install the
creative driver there will be noticeable
noise past the 2k frequency range and
also the crosstalk will introduce some
leakage with the default driver though
once you install that creative driver
not only do you unlock the Sound Blaster
cinema 5 software package which is
actually pretty solid for DSP especially
if I want to play some RPG titles it
does add a level of immersion but after
we installed this driver the line was
looking in the main frequencies pretty
much perfectly flat there was a little
bit of a roll off after 10k this depends
on the maker and how they want you to
perceive the sound and under 20 Hertz we
had 20 to 10 Hertz having only a point
one decibel drop off it was so minimal
that you would see the line looking a
little bit awkward but really nothing to
worry about when we've got 10 to zero
Hertz looking lights got a minus one
decibel roll off so basically the
onboard audio solution is really good
and the crosstalk after you installed
the driver is literally going to minus
90 DB at a hundred volume level so it
doesn't have that problem where I've
seen a lot of motherboards in the past
year especially have a leakage problem
after a volume level of 90 under the mic
import this has got a clear amount of
noise suppression so it is great if you
want your mates to hear you easily while
you're playing games but on the same
token if you want to do anything
professional in terms of recording I'd
suggest getting a different solution so
your voice isn't getting nerfed that is
depending on how strong the noise
suppression is it will take a frequency
out of your vocal range and make your
voice sound essential
more tinnier than otherwise would
anywhere going through more of the
features on this board we've got three
PCIe 16 speed slots on the surface there
looking at the rear of the board you can
see that once in x16 slot one's an x8
one's an X 4 and then you've got X ones
in between also PCIe nvme 3.0 X 4 you
get two of those slots so you can raid 0
nvme m dot two drives if you wish to the
board itself also over SATA 3 supports
raid 0 1 5 and 10 so it does have a lot
of features in terms of what you can do
off the onboard chipset itself they're
putting the speeds and the temperatures
to the test pass with flying colors also
USB 3 speeds are fine and you get a
jewel Nix solution where one of those
solutions is the Intel I to one night
and fee the speeds tested out fine on
that and then you get also a real tech
2.5 g solution so a little bit faster
than your one g solution and coming in
as a budget choice so I guess it doesn't
cost as much as putting 10 G on board so
that's an as rock-solid solution
especially if you've got those NASA's
that support three gigabit transfers
look at the rear of the board you get
HDMI and display out you also get two
USB 3.0 gen 2 one of those being a Type
C one of those being a type 8 and I do
apologize this the new terminology is
sending me a little bit crazy there was
no need for the name changes that will
grow with it as it seems to be printed
everywhere on the box and you also get
two USB 3.0 gen ones as well as your
front USB 3 outs you get two of those as
well as a Type C out moving the
Azeroth's bias nothing's really changed
here but on that note nothing really
needs to change it's got all your easy
support for overclocking you've got the
advanced features for overclocking as
well as internet flash for your BIOS so
if you don't want to go to a website and
download it through Windows you can do
it via this method you've also got
fantastic tuning software which enables
you to control each of the port hubs you
do get five PWM controlled fan headers
on this board and you can control the
RGB within the bias via the 5 volt
addressable RGB header you've also got
two 12-volt RGB headers on board two to
control RGB but I have noticed asrock
have been adding more options to the
polychrome RGB software where the North
&amp;amp; South Bridge of this heatsink do get
RGB features integrated from the get-go
and it does look very subtle very easy
on the eyes as well as giving them
motherboard a little bit of
extra flare though will point out so far
that this is my favorite solution for
RGB control in the bias where you don't
have to load up any software in Windows
which can impact performance I have
tested some of this RGB software from
other manufacturers and it can impact
CPU performance so if you guys want RGB
control but you don't want anything
affecting your games then polychrome is
currently the best option in my opinion
and in closing some of the last features
to go over you get a power and reset
button at the top a doctor debug led
down the bottom so you know if there's a
BIOS read out problem with the board you
can quickly diagnose it and there's the
option to add an m dot to Wi-Fi if you
need Wi-Fi on your motherboard but with
all that out of the way we are now
moving on to the most important thing
with an enthusiast tech product and that
of course is the price tag 195 USD I
will update the description with the AUD
pricing because I currently can't find a
tag on that at the moment but at this
price tag you get everything in between
on a motherboard it's got a nice thick
PCB decent vrm amazing onboard audio
dual necks the ability to raid 0 nvme x
4 speeds and also of course the updated
ascetic and RGB bling and I must say
this is one of my favorite looking as
well boards that has come through here
to date and also I do welcome that new
edition of the integrated i/o shield I
think it looks really nice really handy
to have though although this board does
look like it has everything I will say
one thing and that is the V RM itself is
a mid-range solution so if you are
looking to go real high end on your
overclock so you want to go for a 5.2
gigahertz overclock or you have a 9900 K
that's as bad as mine then you may wish
to step things up to like a phantom
gaming 9 or a Taichi or a Taichi
ultimate where there are equipped with
more phases and a slightly better vrm
this one however will handle 9900 K
overclocks
at 5 gigahertz fine though if you do
want to step it up then keep in mind
that this is kind of like a mid-range
vrm solution and of course everything
else on this board is high-end I do like
the 2.5 g solution for the NIC as well
really nice to touch and that onboard
audio is just simply phenomenal and you
guys hope you enjoyed today's video if
you did - be sure to hit that like
button for us also let us know in the
comment section below
do you like what as rocks done here with
the aesthetics and all the feature set
or would you rather them take away from
that and just simply go for a
and vrm at a mid-range price love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always and without said I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon peace
