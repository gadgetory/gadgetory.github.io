where we're going to go use PC parts
hunting but also already this month and
between this time in the last PC parts
on we've got some really good deals
already went to Thailand picked up a
heap of different motherboards that was
a special edition that I did for you
guys I'll put a link for that and also
off my friend Luke who we did an episode
of PC house call with we've got two
really good computers for an absolute
bargain $200 Australian each of pop and
then the last deal that we got was
actually a deal that came to me this was
a used Alienware laptop they bought a PC
off me and they said the Alienware
laptop was broken and upon booting it up
it was indeed broken the hard drive in
it was just crashing out it would fail
to boot because the sectors are really
bad and damaged and so with that I took
the hard drive out and the SSD still
works so it technically is a working
laptop still we just need to put in a
new hard drive or at least a used one
which were going to be hunting for today
and we've got that for 50 dollars
because I swapped that for a $50 monitor
that I picked up a 27 inch 1080p monitor
and so the Warner was actually worth
around $100 so they wanted $100 for the
laptop so we swapped the monitor for the
laptop and that was an incredibly good
deal but with that said let the part
hunt begin
welcome back to check yet City and today
we're gonna be hunting for a bit of
everything
last month we got a heap of graphics
cards of all practically only hunting
for gravis cards but this month all bets
are off we're going for any deal that we
can pick up as we kind of need a bit of
everything this month and with that said
there are some other players now on the
Gold Coast who are entering the game one
guy message me directly and he said that
he would give me a hand if I needed it
so thank you very much
but I know there's some other players
out there hunting deals on the Gold
Coast now so competition has picked up
but with that said we're gonna do our
best and we're also gonna put on an
accent this time we're switching it up
we're not going with the bogan because I
think people are aware of the bogan now
we're gonna go instead with an American
tourist who is on the Gold Coast and
he's looking to build a cheap PC on the
budget so now this first deal we got up
here is a little bit of practice for my
American accent and it's a hundred and
fifty dollars and it's got an Intel i3
with four gigabytes of RAM now if we add
another four gigabytes to this system
and put a graphics card in it then we
should be able to make an awesome gaming
PC so let's give this a call okay so the
first deal for this desktop Warren did
not pick up the phone so we're just
gonna drop in an offer of $100 and see
if he'll take that since next year we
got up here is the cooler master half
computer case and they're asking 50
Australian dollars for it which would be
like 35 USD but we're gonna try and drop
it down to 35 Ozzie and the good thing
about this is although it's a little bit
old a little bit dirty it includes a lot
of fans I think they said 320 centimeter
fans which is huge but there's also a
super flower power supply in there which
I'm pretty sure is a decent 500 watt
power supply that's hopefully still
working so if we can get this for a
bargain it will actually be a really
good pickup for a used build hey James I
saw your advertisement on a gam tree for
a cool master half computer case yeah
yeah would you be interested in taking
maybe $35 for it back in until after
Christmas I won't be on the Gulf Coast
near Christmas at this point oh really
oh okay
when I get back I can pick it up then
when I'll be back
I'm not sure I'll be back on the 21st of
this week actually whatever you like
yeah I'm just okay that yeah that sounds
pretty good I mean I'm leaving away for
Christmas too so like I'll be back
around that time as well like a bit
after if you still got it yeah you're
the second person that's inquired about
her and I really just want the space
back so yeah you didn't certainly
brought that much okay and also the
other guy bought it oh and then I say
the map they wanted that ship to
Victoria or something oh wow yeah I can
pick it up I'm just like ten minutes
away okay yeah I'll be your new okay man
no worries I'll look forward to it
yeah all right James thanks for that
okay bye
so there it is James is pretty good he's
willing to take $35 I guess but he won't
be back until after Christmas so that's
kind of a long time to wait for the case
I mean if he's back on the 21st which is
four days and we can go pick that up but
hopefully that's a deal in the bag
hopefully so the next deal we got up
here is an r9 380 for gigabyte edition
so it's not a bad deal if we can pick
this up for say $80 so we're gonna drop
in and offer see if they'll take it of
course the lower the better but I think
$80 is a fair price since he's asking
100 and at $80 will be a pretty good
deal
hi Rach Karina I'm trying to look fine
at the moment but just like
message and bring me a number and I'll
give you a call back thank you bye
hey Karina I saw your advertisement on
gam tree comdata you for a graphics card
I'm just looking I got cash and I'm just
looking to pick this thing up if you're
interested in selling it so I just give
me a buzz back bye so that's two out of
three people who haven't picked up their
phone now and hopefully I'm not
butchering this accent too much but I
think it's working out I mean we did get
that first deal we just left a message
on this second deal because I kind of
got to move on I'll drop in an offer of
$80 as well on the website and so the
next day we're pulling up here is a gtx
780 Ti and there's actually no phone
number on it so we're just gonna have to
drop in an offer of a hundred eighty
Australian dollars so they're asking two
hundred and thirty but this card is an
absolute beast and it will overclock
pretty high as I believe they are indeed
Bend the GTX 780 Ti Hall of Fame's not
only that they've got a massive cooler
on them and a backplate which was great
for this error of gravis card not to
mention that this card will still kick
it very hard in today's titles and I'd
love to test one of these cards out
because I have mingled in the past with
GTX 780 s but actually haven't mingled
with a 780ti for quite some time okay
that was the fastest reply I've ever had
they just replied yes 180 strain dollars
so it's a trip to Brisbane but hopefully
there's some other deals here that are
up in Brisbane which is about 80
kilometres up from where I live so it's
gonna be a bit of a drive but if we can
get some other deals up in Brisbane then
that'll be worth the drive so we've
really got an awesome deal here that
we've landed let's check out some others
so another deal that's in the close
vicinity of the 780ti Hall of Fame is a
780ti gigabyte wind force Edition so
kind of similar a little bit inferior to
the Hall of Fame but if we can pick this
up for say 160 Australian and that'll be
a really good deal so let's give this a
call so that's the third person who
hasn't picked up their phone and it is a
Sunday I usually
on a Saturday or Sunday kind of Sunday
being the most preferred day because I
think people would pick up their phones
but maybe I've just got to start hunting
on a Monday or something so try making
an offer of 160 and it's put in an auto
bar
I will then went up to 170 even 175 and
they barred me both times so I mean it
$180 if I offer that for this version
it's kind of like not worth it because
the Hall of Fame oh wait here we go
we're gonna pull right on the spot
hello Hey and I'm just inquiring about
an advertisement on a wwm tree comdata
you for a gigabyte gtx 780 Ti oh yeah
yep yeah would you be interested in
taking say a hundred and sixty dollars
if I came pick it up cash buying it but
I'm just waiting to hear back from
because I did say that we're gonna pick
it up this weekend but I haven't had
anything but you're gonna get back free
blood today
we can definitely do that for you okay
no worries it's just I'm coming from the
Gold Coast and like I'm picking up
another GTX 780 Ti a Hall of Fame
Edition and that's I getting that for
$180 that's a really good one and that's
in Brisbane - so I'll be going through
that area and if you're interested then
yeah I'll pop through man give you some
cash and it's all good yeah yeah I'll be
doing that in a couple of hours I'll be
leaving in say 2 or 3 hours well so just
if I'm driving up that way do you want
me to give you another call or send you
a text yeah okay man no worries thanks
for the call back ed oh that's all right
dude
all right I'll catch you later dude so
hopefully we'll pick up this gratis Cod
for $160 if we can it will make the trip
very worth it
indeed and also with that said we've got
now another two deals left to go one of
those now being a samsung laptop and
this is a pretty interesting deal
because I'm not really interested in the
actual laptop itself I'm interested in
the description where it says that if
you need a hard drive for the laptop or
an upgrade he'll do it for a small fee
so we're gonna give Josh a call and see
if he'll sell the 2.5 inch hard drive
separately and then we can use that to
put in our alien where laptop and fix
that up for really cheap so let's give
that a go now so now there's one more
person who didn't pick up their phone
and this person I'm not really gonna put
in an offer because I actually want to
talk to them and as I said before trying
it the hard drive that they have spare
instead of the actual laptop itself
because I've gotten no use of this
laptop even though if you could pick up
this laptop for a hundred bucks a strain
it wouldn't be a bad deal at all even
then but I don't need a laptop at all at
the moment now the last day we got up
here is a gtx 750ti now we have got one
of these in the past for a hundred and
ten Australian dollars absolute bargain
and this time around it's they're asking
hundred and fifty but if we could go
down to 110 again it would be worth the
drive now the problem is is the drivers
like 80 kilometers that way and
brisbin's that way so if we did indeed
agree on a price on this it would just
be a mammoth amount of driving but to be
honest it would be worth it so let's
give it a call hey Daniel how are you
yeah I'm just inquiring about an
advertisement on a
w-w-w my common for a gigabyte yeah yeah
you say negotiable how negotiable are
you a little bit I've only just uploaded
it so I could probably go cut it up for
150 I could probably go down to 120 yeah
I'll just I'm coming from the gold cool
so like I could come and pick it up
today if you want say
ten cash I come pick it up yep okay yeah
yeah if you're coming all the way from
Gold Coast that's yeah fair enough I no
worries man just text me your address
and I'll uh I'll come and pick her up
now
okay all right Daniel thanks man see you
mate whoa so there it is guys another
GTX 1050 ti4 110 Australian dollars
which would be like 80 USD or something
incredibly good value for money and the
real good thing about this graphics card
is we can put it in practically any PC
and we've got an awesome gaming PC so
we're definitely gonna make the drive
and pick this up and it's gonna be
awesome so with that said I think we'd
get on our bike or at least in the hole
of national we're getting the whole Nash
draw and we go pick up these deals also
let me know in the comment section below
what you think of my botched up American
accent because it is working baby
it's working
so then we have you guys we've now
picked up three graphics cards we got
the GTX 780 Ti the wind force we've got
the Hall of Fame down there and then we
also picked up that 1050 Ti and I'm now
in an area that's really close to my
sister's house so I'm gonna go pay her a
visit probably grab a quick feed while
I'm there and then I've got to go pick
up the next deal as well which is that
PC that I put in a hundred dollars for
they said yes without the monitor and
the keyboard and mouse so that'll be a
pretty good deal as well if I can piece
together a gaming PC for that
so go back in late last night and I was
just so burnt out and tired that it's
went straight to bed and I did spend
some time with my sister she's about an
hour away from me and I was close to
hunting one of those deals and I just
gave her a cold dropped in she hooked us
up a feed gave us a drink it was really
cool because I'm just one of those
people if I'm really hungry as well I
just can't work I don't know if that's a
condition or not but so she hooked us up
with a feed and we just take care of
each other that's what family do guys I
love my family it's really cool I've
taken care of her in the past with the
fixing up pcs they even gave her a
really good deal on a PC as well but
also the deals I've got like the
opposite to a hangover this morning it's
really cool look into this we got a 1050
GI for a hundred and ten Australian
dollars and then we got a GTX 780 Ti
from galaxy I believe this is the last
galaxy card before they've rebranded to
Galax it's also got a missile launch
button a backplate this thing just looks
so cool I can't wait to put this in a
build and speaking of the bills we got
that I three build and that's got a h 55
motherboard from gigabyte a very solid
motherboard unit so I could go get a
Xeon X 34 40 maybe I haven't tested that
one out yet go get one of those and they
coupled out with a 780ti and a more
powerful power supply and we got
ourselves one crazy price performance
build though if you're on a budget you
could and I say could just drop in a
7870 for example an extra four gigabytes
of ram a two sadhas to a six pin or
eight pin and you got yourself a gaming
PC that you could up tick for 250
Australian dollars so order for a
hundred put in some extra parts we could
resell that as a gaming PC for around
350 your strand dollars so that's if you
want to make a quick buck you could do
that as well though to top things off
this PC that I picked up late last night
has a power of man power supply now I
recently used one of these power
supplies never heard of the brand or
name before but now we've seen the
second one here so that was really cool
to see that this PC had a Power Man
power supply in it and also the last day
we got the GTX 780 Ti win for sedition
pick that up for a hundred and sixty
Australian dollars now when I met up
with Ed he said that he had chucked out
an x58 motherboard and so I when I heard
this I was just so debo
I couldn't believe he did this and he
was like damn
he couldn't believe he did it either
after I'd said how good those
motherboards were so it was really cool
just to travel around and get the deals
I mean it seems like there's a lot of PC
parts hunters on the Gold Coast now and
so a lot of the parts are drying up in
my main city but that's not to worry
because I just absolutely love it's one
of my passions and hobbies is just
driving with the windows down listening
to music so I think we traveled about
350 kilometers in total and got some
really good deals probably dropped about
$35 in gas and it was just an epic time
I had a really good time on the road
last night also an update with the new
studio I'm gonna be releasing two vlogs
so they'll be part 2.5 out of three
where we finished the construction and
then there'll be the final part which
would be part three where we're setting
up the tables and all the rigs and stuff
like that so there's still a bit of work
to be done but we've done the painting
on the main walls looks really good for
us I think it does anyway so we all
picked out the colors me Dad man and the
rest of the family so yeah that's coming
along and also in a recent video I did
PC house cool I had to reload that video
too because it had some weird sound
problem where the stereo sound was out
of phase and now I check this on my PC
and what I did was I copied the left
channel to the right channel and then I
saw a shift in the right channel so
there was something but the audio being
out of phase I've never seen this
problem before but basically I think
it's when the left and the right channel
get mixed to mono they cancel each other
out of something so this is our problem
but it's always good to learn these
things for future reference but yeah we
also got one more deal this month and
this was on a thermal imaging camera
from a company called FLIR this is the
one Pro I picked this off the 330 strain
dolls it's brand new type C Android
connection for my mate 10 and in the
States this thing goes for 400 US brand
new so crazy good deal on this you guys
will definitely be able to see more
accurately now temperatures when I do
things like vrm analysis on the channel
so can't wait to put this thing in
practice I've actually already used it
very briefly in the Thunderbolt GTX 1060
video so I'll put a link in the
description below for that that's about
it for today's parts hunt video I hope
you guys enjoyed this one if you did
then be sure to hit that like button and
let me know in the comment section below
you think about the new fake American
accent do you think people were ready
for it also when I met up with the
people I just completely drop the act
and no one says anything I don't think
anyone really cares
especially around where I live I mean
yeah I've never been questioned about it
I've ER I've had a weird look from some
dudes in the past but no one's really
cared I guess also as well we've got
dead graphics cards as well something
I'm going to talk about in an upcoming
episode of can yes fix it so you want to
stay tuned for some of the contents
coming up on the channel and with that
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out peace out for now
