plex media server application which can
be pretty much installed on any device
that I can think of ladies and gentlemen
welcome back to techie ICT this is brian
coming back to you guys today with a
review of an interesting application
called plex media server now when they
reached out to me and asked me to do a
review of their service i thought hey
why not i'll take a look at it and it's
at first glance I kind of got confused
about what the actual service did but
upon installing it and actually using it
I was very impressed with its features
and so today I'm going to talk about how
this affects me and how I get the
benefits out of Plex and who this
application might benefit so essentially
what Plex is is an application that will
install on the said device and once its
installed it will enable that device to
stream all the music movies photos and
videos to other devices that have the
application installed now there's a lot
of benefits to this however I'm going to
talk about my experience and how it
benefits me in my life and the biggest
thing it does benefit me is when I'm
using my smart phone which only has 8
gigabytes of storage now since I've
installed this on my windows 8 NASA I'm
able to leave that on 24 hours a day and
when I go to the gym I can then access
any music file I can from that and
stream it to my Android device now
another added benefit of this as well is
that the said device will do all the
processing as well so in other words
it's not only giving me an access to a
plethora of music and movies that I
couldn't otherwise store on my Android
phone it's also saving my Android device
battery as well because it's not having
to use the CPU power from this device
also some other features that I do like
about the plex media server is that I
can install different music channels on
my device so I can pretty much play any
different music from those channels at
any given time if I get bored of my
current selection of music
another feature worth mentioning is the
ability to sync up as well to a cloud
service like Google Drive and then you
can upload your media files there and
play them at any
given time without having the need for a
dedicated device so what's the catch to
all this well there isn't many I mean if
you want to triplex today you can try it
for free now keep in mind though on the
free membership you will incur ads which
is a little bit annoying though they do
have the monthly option there to try it
out for five dollars which is a good
thing if you just wish to give it a test
drive and then they've got the option
there for a yearly membership for forty
dollars and then the lifetime one-time
fee of a hundred and fifty dollars which
they provided me with for free in order
to do this review however that being
said once you get a lifetime membership
I really can seeing this being useful
for many other applications than me just
going to the gym and playing music for
instance if you've got a heap of friends
and you want to make a big
interconnected Nath storage for music
and movies then you could all chip in
together and make that nest and also all
chip in for the lifetime membership of
the actual plex media subscription the
legal ramifications of which I don't
know also getting into the software and
the UI itself it's very easy to set up a
very clean-looking UI and you can add
your files with just a few clicks of a
button whether it be music movies or
photos and besides that playing music is
just simple as selecting it and then
putting it on the device and you're good
to go now if there was anything I had to
critique about this service it's not a
whole lot I would say one thing to Plex
though and that is I would like to see a
more simple what does this do for me on
their front page because when I first
looked at the plex media server I'd had
no idea what it was I thought it was a
cloud-based storage and then I started
using it for myself and started getting
into it and I realized what it was so it
is a niche product however I'm certain
that it will fulfill a niche desire so
kudos to plex for making an excellent
application which I can highly recommend
and if you guys have a need for going to
the gym and wanting to play things from
your Android smartphone or traveling and
wanting to access a lot of movies from
your tablet and you hooked up to the
Internet then you can do so install
with just on the thing at home like
you're nasty so anyway you guys if you
have any questions or comments about the
Flex media service application please
drop a comment in the comment section
below and I'll get back to you as soon
as I can
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
