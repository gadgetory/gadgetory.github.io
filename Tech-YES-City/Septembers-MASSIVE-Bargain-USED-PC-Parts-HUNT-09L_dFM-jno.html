we're going use PC parts hunting and
last month we managed to get a HD 6950
and also an all-in-one PC for pretty
good prices this month yet again we're
gonna be looking for some used GPUs and
see if we can snap up some bargains
welcome back to tech yes City and let's
pull up those deals
so the first tear would pulled up here
I'm really excited about it's a GTX 690
now I've never tried one of these cards
personally I've always wanted to get one
and now it looks like the price is right
Reed is selling one of these for a
hundred and sixty-five Australian
dollars and that is in u.s. dollars
about a hundred and thirty-two dollars
so it's a really good price even for
what he's asking at the moment because
one Australian dollar is weaker than a
US dollar it's like 80 US cents so we're
gonna give him a call of course and try
and even put in a little bit lower of an
offer maybe pick it up for a hundred and
fifty Australian dollars even so let's
put on that bogan voice and see if we
can get the deal okay right there you go
mate yeah good yeah I saw you add on
gumtree for a GTX 690 yeah yeah mate
would you take 150 for one of them I see
some posing for three Andy yeah so two
694 three and a you ain't gonna laugh I
know and I'm I just always trying to get
deal you know you know I just I'll come
pick them up 3-under you just take such
a dress mate and tell me what time to
pick them up all right
thanks mate bye so we just got off the
phone to read and he only wanted to sell
both the cars for 300 ashran dollars
which is like 240 USD and honestly I'm
not gonna argue with that price I'm just
gonna take it because if I don't someone
else will definitely pick that up
because that is a really good deal at
its current price so we're gonna move on
to the next deal which is a GTX 970 now
the seller wants 280 Australian dollars
for it we're gonna drop in an offer of
$200 since of course the GTX 1060 is
already out and that's already good
performance for the doll
hello hey race here you go mate
what y'all saw yet on gumtree for a GTX
970 correct yeah would you take 200 for
just that there's the GTX 1060 s that
are out and they go for around three
hundred so the three gigabyte ones
literally the 970 in the 1063 gigabyte
but the ninth series or four gigabyte so
yeah I just I said I thought they had
3.5 what the nine seven is yeah god says
on the box for geeks okay mate no
worries
yeah all right yeah 250 is pretty good
night all right thanks for that bye
so we just got off the phone to Rhys and
he wanted 250 Australian for his 970 and
that's not really a good deal at that
price and what I said on the phone was
pretty much the truth a 1060 at 300 with
three gigabytes uses less power it's
also got warranty and I believe it'll
actually perform better on average than
a 10 and then a 970 will anyway so yeah
that's kind of a miss on that deal so
before we move on to the next deal I
wanted to talk about today's video
sponsor audible with audial you can
download any of your favourite books and
then just simply listen to them across
many different platforms like iOS
windows and Android and all you have to
do is sign up and you get a 30-day free
trial with a credit which will be able
to purchase a book completely free I
decided to use the credit on my favorite
book of all time how to win friends and
influence people it's an incredible book
it should actually be called how to
communicate with people and better
yourself as a person because that's what
this book does it's incredible for
making new friends talking to people and
just in general making yourself a better
person I've read this book and now I'm
listening to it on audible so in the
modern day age if you don't
time to read or you just simply don't
like reading then audio is a really good
solution there's also tons of different
categories like sci-fi mystery romance
that you can browse through download
these books and just simply listen to
them rather than reading they've also
got the option to share books between
friends and also many other different
configurations that you can use on this
website so if you want to trial it for
free then head on into the link I'll put
it in the description below audio book
comm slash tech yes City for a free
30-day trial you can cancel at any time
in those 30 days if you don't like the
service so there's nothing to lose and a
lot to gain anyway guys link is in the
description below let's get back to
those deals so the next deal we've got
up here is another GTX 970 this is a
Strix Edition he's asking $250 for it
but unfortunately there is no number to
call so we're just gonna drop in an
offer of 200 see if they'll take it so
the next deal I'm pulling up here is an
R 9 280 and I believe they're similar in
performance to a HD 7950 this is a three
gig model very good card for gaming he's
asking a 140 Australian dollars for it I
put in an offer of a hundred straddles
which would be about 80 USD and he
doesn't have a number to call again so
now the last deal we got up here for
graphics cards is 2 GTX 780 windforce
editions and now the seller is asking
200 astraying dollars each for one of
these cards I'm gonna put in an offer of
300 of strandos for the pair which is
about 240 USD see if he takes that and
again there's no number to call here so
guessing there's maybe a bit of a trend
going on with gum trend that is people
don't want bogans like myself calling up
so besides the graphics cards there's
now two other deals that I'm pulling up
here the first is ddr3 memory always
need ddr3 memory for a good build and
the seller is asking $80 for 16
gigabytes of ddr3 memory we're gonna
drop in and give them a call and drop in
an offer of 60 or strainers which like
48 US dollars for four sticks of ddr3
memory and see how it goes hello Kai how
are you good mate I uh saw your
advertisement on gumtree for
ddr3 for gigabyte memory yeah that's
right
would you take $15 for one stick yeah
okay make just text me your address and
I'll come pick her up yeah that's fine
mate just text me the time and the
address thanks Kai bye so Kai said that
he already sold three sticks of memory
so again I put in an offer with the
price scaling to my original offer and
he accepted that so we're gonna go
collect that a little bit later so now
the last thing we got up here is a
desktop PC with LGA 1156 and eight
gigabytes of memory so it doesn't look
too bad it's an OEM PC they're asking a
hundred and seventy-five astraying
dollars for it we're gonna try and drop
in an offer of a hundred strain dollars
which will be about 80 USD and if we can
get it for that price it'll be a pretty
good pickup I hello Karen how are you
yeah I saw your advertisement on a gum
tree dot-com do you for a desktop
computer yeah I just need the the box
like the actual computer so would you
like take a hundred for it yeah hundred
bucks a when could I pick her up
no worries well I'm just making a few
rounds so if you could just Texas your
address and I'll come through and pick
her up
all right thanks Karen
all right so we just off the phone and
we got that for a hundred Australian
dollars like 80 USD so now we've got
three deals confirmed I'm just waiting
for all the text
to come through with the times that's
actually coming through now so just
waiting for a few more texts and
addresses and times to come through then
I'm gonna go pick up all these parts a
bit later on we're also waiting on those
offers to come back for two of those
gratis cards that I sent by a gum tree
so hopefully they come back before the
afternoon when we go to pick up some of
these parts and of course I want to go
and test out all these parts to make
sure that we don't get hosed also a big
thank you for some of you guys who have
sent in some pots completely free over
the last few months some of them which
you'd like me to test so I'm gonna be
making a dedicated video to that one of
the most curious parts is a rise in CPU
with bent pins on it which is crazy like
a lot of these pins are bent so I'm
gonna be having a fun time seeing if I
can fix this up and seeing if it works
still so now it's time to go pick up
some of these deals and the guy with the
GTX 780 s actually got back to me and
said he accepted my offer so we're gonna
go pick up that as well unfortunately
the GTX 690 s he hasn't messaged me back
yet but he did say he was at work so
hopefully when he's on the road he'll
message us and we can go pick them up as
well but let's get out of here because
I'm
so you got back now from picking up
three of the four deals the 690 guy I'm
still waiting on a reply from him so
hopefully it replies before dinner if it
goes long after dinner then I guess he's
just not keen and he's maybe found
another deal or something loud but we've
got here two seven 80s pick these up for
300 a strand or two 40 USD gonna clean
it up and see if they work this here is
the desktop PC that we got for 180 or 80
USD now the lady was kind enough to show
us this thing fully working so we know
it's awesome we know it works and she
even throw in the windows 7 ultimate so
we should be out I pray this to Windows
10 it should be all good then we've got
a free keyboard and mouse you threw in
Cherry throwing a monitor as well now
usually I wouldn't take the monitor but
I will be building a nasan and something
like this is perfect for an ass you
don't need any fancy monitors just for
an ass system so that would be really
good and then the ddr3 memory we can
actually just drop this in this rig and
see if it works so that's an easy fix
but let's get on to cleaning up these
parts and making them look a little bit
better than they are now
so we're cleaning up this PC now and it
is by far one of the dirtiest pcs of sin
in my life
the fans were just filthy it was covered
in dust and the good news is we've
cleaned it all up now and it's got a p55
zeus motherboard in there for core 750
i5 a gigabytes of memory and a 500 watt
cooler master power supply so this is
really good value for money none of that
sort of 1 terabyte hard drive it also
has a 9600 GT which is a completely
useless graphics card so we're gonna put
in something like a 750 Ti because
ironically enough this power supply
doesn't have any PCI Express cables even
though it's got a good June 20 and 12
volt rail which is really odd but let's
put this thing back together and make it
shine
so now what you're gonna test the first
crabbers card and see if this boots up
and even after that I actually want to
stress it in UniGene heaven to see if we
need to change the thermal paste as well
but because there's a 780 it should be
okay I think it should be fine
so the first gtx 780 we have up here is
running absolutely fine it's working
perfectly it's hovering around 70
degrees and the fans are really quiet I
think that's normal but it might benefit
from a thermal paste change and this GTX
780 is running perfectly fine as well
one interesting thing to note is that
this one is not the GHz Edition and
doesn't have the back plate either so it
is a little bit slower but it does have
the same cooling solution so with that
it should be as you can see here running
a little bit cooler than the GHz Edition
which it is and now for this last part
we've got this PC that we cleaned up and
we've also put the 750 Ti in and that
four gigabyte stick that we bought
earlier so hopefully we can kill two
birds with one stone we have a signal we
are working and it looks like everything
is good to go the fans are a little bit
noisy however one of these fans will
definitely need to be replaced well I
think we found the culprit so all the
parts we picked up here today are
working perfectly fine and also some
really awesome uses of the guy with the
GTX 690 s has gotten back to me or be
it's pretty late at night so we're gonna
go pick these up now and see how good
they are
so I just got back from meeting up with
Reid and he had the two gtx 690 s for
$300 we'll test them out soon just to
make sure that they work although he
said that they did work and they were
perfectly finally actually showed me a
screenshot of him working but also i
talked to him on the phone and he was
also keen for an RGB keyboard and I told
him I had a cool master of master keys
Pro L laying around and he started to
offer me parts like an x58 motherboard
10 gigabytes of ddr3 memory i-79 ATX a
corsair case and at this stage I was
like yeah definitely I take this
keyboard off my hands I want these parts
and even threw in some ek waterblock
fittings as well so that was really cool
so I was really happy with that other
deal that I got on top of the GTX 690 s
but let's go quickly test these out make
sure they work and it's actually really
late at night but we'll just quickly try
and boot up this x58 board as well
so there it is guys all the parts we've
got through here today are working and
they're working perfectly fine I am just
amazed everything we've gone through
here is not missing a beat except for
one of the gtx 690 s you may have seen
in the footage that one of the cause was
going over 90 degrees so i'll have to
pull this apart and replace the thermal
paste and then recheck the temperatures
and i think that goes for every use
graphics card i'm gonna pick up from now
I think I'll just replace the thermal
paste anyway it's not only gonna get you
better temperatures in some cases a lot
better temperatures but it's just great
for peace of mind going forward I find
usually in half the cases of use GPUs I
have to replace the thermal paste to get
the GPU working fine so I should just
make it a practice to do it on every
used GPU that I buy from here on in but
when it all comes down to it we got four
graphics cards today two GTX 780 s 2 GTX
6 90s which I've never even laid hands
on in my life before and we've got them
for a really good price really good deal
got a whole PC with the p55 motherboard
good power supply a gigabytes of memory
I 5 754 core overclockable decent case
all this in a stick of ddr3 memory some
water block fittings and i7 980 X and
x58 motherboard and 10 gigabytes of ddr3
memory on that all for 715 Australian
dollars man this is easily like the best
day of used parts PC hunting in my life
this is crazy good I'm stoked
I hope you guys have enjoyed today's
video and with that said a big thank you
to today's sponsor audible and if you

so was it so check that out the GTX 690
actually doesn't have a HDMI port so I
had to use a DisplayPort to HDMI or
actually a mini DisplayPort to
DisplayPort to HDMI ports that's two
adapters just to get a signal to make
capture card that's crazy and also a big
thank you to you guys on Twitter I asked
you guys what parts I should go
searching for some mentioned like gtx
1060 s 1050 TI's and some other things
like an online fury I couldn't find any
of those parts I did search for them so
thanks for your suggestions however one
of the suggestions of gtx 690 was a gold
suggestion so thanks for that also a cab
from Tech's showdown mentioned that I
should look for a FX 95 90 i mean we're
coming out of winter here in australia
so I'm not ready jokes aside I'm not
ready to put a heater in my house</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
