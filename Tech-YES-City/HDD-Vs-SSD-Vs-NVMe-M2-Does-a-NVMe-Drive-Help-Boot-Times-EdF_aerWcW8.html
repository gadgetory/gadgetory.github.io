you've either experienced or heard of a
thing called an MDMA and got to drive
though do you actually need one of these
drives today I'm going to be testing
this M 2 versus an SSD this is a hard
disk drive to see what's really going on
lower the text CD this is brian coming
to you guys today with some real-world
benchmarks except one of them which is a
synthetic but going on with the
contenders first we've got here a 5400
rpm Western Digital hard drive now hard
drives are still very popular to this
date so it's actually good to include
one of these and see how worse it fares
compared to the other two that being
said though we have an SSD which is a
crucial MX 300 and then we have an m dot
to drive here which actually uses the
PCIe lanes to transfer data as opposed
to the hard disk drive and solid-state
disk which also transfer via a thing
called side of three so getting on into
the first benchmark here we have
synthetic benchmark called a s SSD we
can see that the nvme drive did score a
major victory over the other to the SSD
did hammer the hard drive and the hard
drive just really couldn't complete this
benchmark it took me like an hour to do
this benchmark on the hard disk drive
and it's not really intended for these
drives but anyway next benchmark we had
it was the boot test and the SSD in BO
cm to drive pulled well ahead of the
hard disk drive though the difference
between the nvme drive in the SSD was
virtually little with the m2 actually
getting edged out by the SSD so the SSD
was the fastest in this test and that
probably came from the PCIe MDOC truth
having utilized an extra layer of
initialization there the next benchmark
we had here was booting up a game we had
battlefield 1 and the nvme SSDs again
scored very similar there was nothing
between these two drives and also the
hard disk drive coming well behind those
other two moving on to the next
benchmark loading up a browser with five
different tabs from a fresh boot this
was in Chrome and we can see here that
the nvme and SSD really scored in the
same league and then the hard drive
again falling a little bit behind so
then I decided to do some more intense
benchmarks which I guess would favor
people who are doing productivity and we
would look at the file transfers when
within the drive itself we see the m2
ahead of the S
then in the SSD pulled ahead of the hard
disk drive and the same goes when we
decided to do the next benchmark which
is Adobe Premiere Pro and this had to do
with loading files into a fresh project
on Premiere Pro we can see here that the
nvme actually scored a victory here by a
little bit compared to the SSD and the
SSD and the nvme both came well ahead of
the hard disk drive those you guys saw
in the benchmarks the hard drive was
well behind the m-dot to drive the SSD
so if you are on a budget then a hard
drive is still going to be a pretty good
choice
keep in mind as well this was a 5400 rpm
drive which is actually quite a bit
slower than a 7200 rpm drive also on
that note if you are a gamer then you're
not going to generally get extra FPS out
of using an SSD versus a hard drive
though if you are then there might be
something wrong with your computer
though if you can afford an SSD then I
highly recommend them even if it is a 32
gigabyte drive that they're going really
cheap on Amazon as they'll make your OS
boot a lot faster make your browser and
all your core files load up a lot
quicker as opposed to a standard hard
drive so now it's time to answer that
final question of who actually needs an
nvme drive and as you saw on those
benchmarks the boot test in the game
boot test there really wasn't anything
or any difference between the SSD and
MDOT 2 that is if you're a gamer you're
not really going to benefit from buying
an nvme drive except for those extra
synthetic speeds the weather did come
into play was when I did those file
transfers and also that Premiere Pro
boot and load in test with those files
so you can see in a Productivity
environment when you actually really
need those raw speeds that's when the m2
darts to become of good value so that we
have it if you guys are gamers then
you're probably best off saving your
money and just going with an SSD versus
MDOT to drive though if you are doing
productivity work and you need something
that's really fast and you need to save
time for example you need a fast dump
drive for Premiere Pro then you may want
to go with an nvme drive and of course
if you're on a budget then nothing is
going to beat the hard drive for raw
data for the money and I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did then be
sure to hit that like button and let me
know in the comment section below what
setup are you running for data
configuration at the moment we'd love to
hear your comments as always and I'll
catch you in the next tech video very
soon peace out for now bye
and the hard disk drive which both use
sided to 0-3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
