PC gaming is expensive to get into and
now this can be true if you're buying
new parts especially in today's market
though today I'm going to show you guys
an alternative something that I built
this month that's very easy to do it's
inexpensive and of course at worst all
you have to do is probably change a
graphics card and maybe even clean out
your computer and for under $200 you can
have something that can play the latest
titles of 1080p and play it very well
even titles like pop G at 1080p 60fps
and get a very smooth experience also
other titles like overwatch csgo and
dota 2 are no problems to so let's take
a look at this PC that I built welcome
back to tech yes City this is brian
coming to you guys today with a video on
the cheapest and easiest way to get into
PC gaming now this month when I was out
deal hunting I picked up a PC for 80 US
dollars now this thing was pretty dirty
when I got a home I cleaned it up
however I noticed that it had pretty
good parts in it had a 4 core i5 one
terabyte hard drive a gigabytes of ddr3
memory motherboard decent power supply
and decent case with 2 included fans and
a heatsink already on there and now it
was already working I confirmed this
when I go to buy it so if you guys are
gonna do what I do in this video and I
do recommend it then I do stress this do
make sure that the parts are working
before you go buy them one thing with
use parts and one thing that's a big
headache is when you buy a part and it
just simply doesn't work ie you got
hosed though a good hosing aside if you
manage to pick up a PC like I have here
and you put in a graphics card like a
gtx 750ti
then you'll have a really good gaming
experience now the gtx 750ti was a very
popular graphics card when it was
released a few years ago
however since there's new cards out like
the 1050 1050 TI a lot of people who
want to upgrade to the latest and
greatest will now be selling this 750
eyes
so in some cases you can pick them up
for around 50 to $100 and at this price
it's a pretty good deal you add this in
and it doesn't need any PCIe connectors
and you can have a decent game
experience now the PC that I bought here
actually came with a gravis card it's a
really old gravis gosselin
9600 GT which is very old it'll play
terribly in today's titles so I then
took this graphics card out which is
very easy you may need a screwdriver
depending on the PC and then put the
750ti in and I was good to go
I was now ready to play games however
before I did that I also like to
overclock now that's something that a
lot a lot of people can do I'm sure if
you're just getting into PC gaming it's
gonna be very confusing for you but the
computer that I had here and an i5 750
which is a 4 core and it's actually
quite old to today's standards I believe
it's a seven year old CPU however it's
still very good and it can still play
games at 1080p take for example when we
go into pub G I had this cpu running at
3.5 7 gigahertz on all 4 cores which is
a sizable boost over the out-of-the-box
2.6 6 gigahertz also on the graphics
card I managed to give that an ear extra
200 megahertz on the core and also
around 250 megahertz on the memory and
at these overclocks I was getting really
good performance we take for example pub
G 1080p I was getting very low settings
around 60 fps at all times and now very
low is what a lot of pros like to use in
this game it definitely the foilage and
stuff like that in battles you'll also
get less dips and this is exactly what
was happening especially when it came to
gunfights I was getting no problems
whatsoever doing those clutch plays so
overclocking is something that if you
can do then I highly recommend it here
on the channel now continuing on with
the titles when I do budget builds a lot
of people seem to request GTA 5 so
booting this up running it at 1080p
normal settings we're getting near
hundred frames alot of the time
sometimes going even higher very smooth
experience not many dips I mean there is
the occasional dip that's inherent to
GTA 5 itself but besides that very
smooth experience now next up here we
had a popular multiplayer eSports title
from Blizzard this was overwatch at all
times were pretty much getting over 80
FPS at 1080p high settings a lot of the
times it was going into a hundred fps so
is a very smooth experience one that
this 150 dollar PC was handling
perfectly fine and of course not to
forget about csgo which is another very
popular title we're on dear
dust2 with a high-low blend which is how
I like to play this game especially at
1080p at these settings will getting
over 200 FPS at practically all times
extremely smooth experience one which
someone would love when they're playing
csgo especially competitive gamers and
the last title we've got up here is dota
2 one which I used to be good at now I
kind of suck because I don't play that
much anymore but at 1080p high settings
will getting near again a hundred FPS at
practically old times there was no dips
even in battles very smooth experience
so if you guys are looking for a PC that
can get into 1080p gaming and it's not
gonna give you dips when you're on those
clutch plays which is arguably the most
important time when you need your
computer to perform then something like
this on a budget is highly recommended I
absolutely love it and even the month
before that I picked up a computer for a
little bit more but it did have again a
four core eight gigabytes of memory the
whole package so all you have to do a
lot of the times is adding the gtx 750ti
now if you're in australia you can get
these for around sixty Australian
dollars if you're in the u.s. they're up
on eBay all the time around fifty to a
hundred dollars really when it gets to a
hundred dollars you could think about
getting a gtx 1050 which is on amazon
and you can pick them up for around
about a hundred and ten used so if you
want to get a modern-day card than a gtx
1050 will definitely perform even better
than the 750ti that i've featured here
today though with a computer like this
what about maintenance and what about
keeping those temperatures low well in
this case we're using a low powered
750ti so it doesn't put out much heat to
begin with so really with these graphics
cards that don't require PCI connectors
you don't have to worry about them as
the terms of the CPU it's a four core it
doesn't use much power on its own
however I did overclock it to three
point five seven gigahertz on the stock
cooler and even then in a twenty eight
degree ambient environment the
temperatures were going to ninety
degrees so we still had an extra 10
degrees Headroom on a stock cooler which
is arguably one of the worst things you
can put on this I 5 750 but one big
question I get asked and this is that
this PC looks good it's cheap how did
you get this thing for so cheap and the
trick is that you have
to ask for the deals you have to search
for those deals no ASCII no Getty that's
a general rule of thumb so a lot of the
times I only hunt once a month in
Australia and like literally on that day
I'll just pull up the deals and go
hunting and I seem to be doing very well
in Australia now I was in Japan before
getting really good deals and when I was
over there a lot of people said when you
go back to Australia you're not going to
get the deals dude and I seem to keep
getting the deals and I'm sure if I was
in the US or frawls in the UK where
there's a lot of you spots I'm pretty
sure that I could get the deals again
you've just got a not to look for and
get those deals and today I'm showing
you guys a very good formula if you want
to get into PC gaming just look for an
OEM computer I'll put some links and
some search titles in the description
below on what to look for now this just
wouldn't really be much of a techie a
city video if I didn't give you guys
some specific recommendations so in eBay
or in Craigslist or in Gumtree you can
type in some simple searches like
desktop computer or desktop PC and from
here you can look around and see what
comes up ideally we're looking for a
fork or something with an i5 2400 or an
i5 750 or an i5 3470 these are for cause
their budget and usually pcs with these
specifications on them will come with a
fork or a gigabytes of RAM one terabyte
hard drive power supply motherboard
whole case and all you have to do like
we said before is add in a graphics card
however when you do type in desktop
computer or desktop PC it can bring up a
lot of old dinosaurs things which won't
even perform well in today's games
they're just a complete waste of time
and so if you do want to save a bit of
time you can type in more specific
searches for instance like I 5 2400 PC o
i5 750 PC I 530 470 PC though another
trick if you are on a budget you can
type in AI 5 550 PC and what this will
do is will bring up a cheaper version
that you can then put AZ on in for
instance an X 30 450 or an X 34 70 which
is a CPU you can get for around about
$35 put that in this PC if you're
interchanging a CPU and you now
have one fork or eight threaded beast on
a budget as well however another thing
on that note when you're looking for the
PC parts make sure you don't get scammed
when I was looking at 750ti is I noticed
that there was literally fake 750 T is
even one of the ads was sponsored I
can't believe eBay allows this to happen
I'm actually gonna send eBay a message
and ask him while they're allowing
sellers to do this as I think it's
ridiculous and you can tell straight
away it's there's a hundred and ninety
two bit wide bit bus this is not cool
this is essentially I believe a five
series graphics card like a GTX 560 Ti
I'm not too sure but something like that
will perform a lot slower than a 750 Ti
so essentially you're getting hosed on
this deal a 750ti has a 128-bit wide bit
bus I believe so that grab is card if
you're looking for it take a look at the
photos and also just check the
information and make sure it checks out
make sure you're not getting hosed you
can always ask in the comment section
below
where a lot of people will be glad to
help you out anyway guys if you enjoyed
today's video then be sure to give it a
big thumbs up and let me know in the
comment section below what some of the
best deals you've picked up lately and
also if you've got any other
alternatives be sure to post them in the
comment section below or if you have any
questions about today's build and how I
get these things so clean and also on
that note when I do clean my pcs I just
use alcohol wipes a lot of the time
sometimes I'll use a rag and wd-40 to
give it a nice shiny finish anyway guys
if you're dealing with electronics as
well make sure the powers switched off
and all the powers drain - and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
