1440p build and some of my viewers got
me really excited in the comments
particularly one when he mentioned an ex
5650 and I was like what was this CPU so
I started researching it more and I
found that it's pretty much the best
bang for buck CPU you can get at the
moment it's a 32 nanometer six core
twelve threaded CPU that's going from
anywhere from sixty to a hundred dollars
and the best thing is it's overclockable
so I thought I'd turn this video into a
vlog sort of what parts I've got and
sort of like a precursor to an upcoming
video where I'm going to build two
workstations four hundred five hundred
dollars used anyway let's get on with it
recently my boss found out about my
youtube channel and he's kind of he was
impressed he was like man I want you to
do some of the stuff that you're doing
on your YouTube channel for me at work
and I was like okay cool no problems
however all the computers at work
they've got all the Japanese proprietary
software installed and you know they've
got the ad the IT guy he kinda doesn't
like me even though my boss loves me so
he's like nah man you can't install your
programs on our computer so I was kind
of like well I'll just build my own
workstation and I don't have to answer
to anyone so I decided to do that and
since I found this fractal to fine I
forth like $20 it was just at some
random second-hand store in the middle
of nowhere I never thought I'd find it
enthusiastic bro there when I saw it for
20 bucks I instantly grabbed it cleaned
it up and then that power splay there
that's $10 as well so I'm just going to
go through all the bargains I've got
here today and what I'm going to do with
all these parts but pretty much I've got
all this stuff here for like under 500
bucks and I'm going to put two
workstations together so what we've got
here is a GTX 285 that's this came with
this whole case and everything here so
everything you see in this frame here
was like a hundred and I think $80
delivered so I got like three gigabytes
of ddr3 memory which will go on the off
rig
I got an i7 920 which I'm probably going
to sell and I got this GTX 285 which I'm
probably going to sell and then I got a
650 watt power supply - which has 40
amps on the 12 volt rail and then I got
here an x58 SLI platinum so this is the
key ingredient you need to get an X 58
if you want to get the six core 12
threaded beast going you have to get a
motherboard that supports it and there's
not all not all the x58 motherboard
support the CPU so you got to pick one
carefully and so this was the one that I
found it'll do probably up to 4.2 gigs
if I'm lucky so I got all this for a
hundred one hundred and eighty dollars I
think posted so motherboard we even got
he's even got a DVD drive there and a
hard drive and the best thing is this
case has also got one of these these are
so convenient if you're doing video work
you've got the memory card reader as
well so it's got that as well even
though the case looks like junk so this
case and all the
both parts will be gone to my wife since
she wants a computer but she never uses
a computer so I figured I'll build a one
for like a hundred bucks anyway these
are the parts that are going to go in my
workstation this is the Xeon I'm sorry
that's the Xeon w 35:20 now that's a
really cheap CPU I got that for ten
dollars and it's going to replace the i7
920 even though it's the same thing so I
can sell the i7 924 more winning and
then we've got here the X 5650 it's
still packaged up but this is a six core
12 threaded B so this is going to be
going in this motherboard this
motherboard is beginning going to go in
this case and this power supply is going
to go in this case too because it's
power supplies a little bit weaker so
anyway we've got the 650 Ti boost this
is going to be the workstation card I
mean it's got 2 gigabytes of vram which
is pretty good this is the reason why I
picked it it's also got shadowplay as
well which is pretty important
especially for me I like I should you
not I've been using shadow place so much
for a lot of the content I've been
making instead of taking screenshots I
just hit the key bang bring it into
Premiere Pro good to go so that saves me
so much time as well as taking all these
temperatures and all these schools and
stuff like that really good so something
with shadow play was pretty crucial I
picked it off for $70 so 650 Ti boosts
which is pretty much like a 750 Ti
you can even sli these things that's
pretty cool as well so $70 let's move on
to this you probably wonder what this
bad boy is I got this for $5 it was junk
had no fans on it so I'm going to
basically zip tie off to fans I think
I've got them down here I'm going to zip
tie off to fans here and put them on
this CPU cooler and then put it on the
x58 SLI Platinum so this cooler it means
chunky it's good Ailes surprised to pick
that off so cheap this here is a x58
board it's a tea power from Biostar I
think now the problem with this board is
it doesn't support the six core 12
threads Aeons I don't think from what I
was researching but I'm going to update
the boss and give it a try anyway I've
got the W 50 35 20 which is going to go
in here anyway
if that doesn't work but this port
actually looks pretty damn cool like I
gotta say the gold sort of black Styles
not like not too bad for an old-school
x58 motherboard which I'm kind of
surprised like this actually looks
pretty cool I don't wonder what these
guys aren't making motherboards anymore
I thought this board kind of looks cool
maybe the BIOS or maybe the support was
pretty crap who knows I never used a
biased on motherboard in my life so this
is going to be first anyway that's the
motherboard there so that's about it I
mean I've got to get some more memory
I've got this drive as well as a 750
gigabyte 5400 rpm drive so that'll be
going in the off rig since it's pretty
slow and it's pretty junky came out of a
brick the laptop so but I've got the
hard drive out and it's got like it's in
these enclosed kind of cases I've really
got no idea what the person was thinking
with this like this is just you pity I
mean you're suffocating your hard drive
yeah sure you've got some sound
deadening going on but I mean look at
this like I'm surprised these drives
made it through a summer if they did so
that's crazy so anyway that's like this
hard drive encasement here that sort of
I don't know what it's designed to do
kill the hard drive or something so
hopefully the drive still works
hopefully you get something out of this
bad boy let's hit the power button first
time fingers crossed everything's hooked
up now fans of spin can we get a signal
can we get a signal
come on me a signal give me a signal
baby oh yes we got a signal success okay
we're going to try and restart this and
hook up a keyboard mouse and here's the
final test so we're going to test this
other power supply we're to test this
we're using the same memory from the
other rig because I know it works and we
just got a that's right as The Naked CPU
just sitting on the top of the CPU just
for testing anyway I've got the GTX 285
year got the motherboard so we're going
to fire it up and I mean I already fired
it up but interestingly enough it didn't
work with memory in the first bank so
that was really weird
so this it's posting fine and I mean
we've got a screen so I guess the first
triple lane channel there is not working
because I mean it says on the
motherboard a one is the lighter beige
color so that's pretty weird anyway I
have to look into that a little bit more
bit regardless even with only three
banks I'm still happy because I've paid
next to nothing for this motherboard and
the CPU so this is really cool like
awesome stuff so we got the the Xeon
works as well the 15 who later $13 CPU
that's working and so even the hard
drives working so that's everything I've
tested everything now I have to test the
six core 12 threaded CPU but I've got to
update the BIOS on the MSI board in
order to test that and update the BIOS
on this board as well to see if it works
ok so we've got the 12 threaded 6 core
beefed in hand it's ready to go
so anyway here's these Siskel er here
you can brucey already from the video
that there's the front half here is like
silver coloured and then this is like
copper colored so they're putting a
coating of something on the actual
copper base plate which I mean I don't
really think it's a good thing I just
rather just a pure copper base plate and
feels like they're putting some kind of
lacquer on the actual like honestly like
a Lac attack on there so to make that
seem like it's a mirror finish I don't
know just it's weird so anyway I just
lapped it and to me it it I think it'll
perform better than before that's just
my gut feeling um you can see here like
if I scratch this and then I flip it
around and I scratch the top you hear
the difference like I can hear the
difference anyway so it's as if they put
some kind of crap all over their product
that is sort of hindrance to performance
I think anyway you know just I just
rather have the base especially nice and
raw and uncut x50 650 is confirmed and
working now you're probably wondering
why those temperatures are so low you
probably like oh the temp sensor is
actually wrong and I don't think it is
because I just like 10 minutes ago I
just lapped it and sprayed it down with
brake cleaner and brake the brake
cleaner I use has this frosting effect
kind of thing on the cooler so it's like
15 degrees in here if you can see that
but it's actually the CPU cooler is
actually colder than the ambient
temperatures which usually is not the
case but in this case it is because the
cooler was sprayed with brake cleaner
but anyway you can see that that IOH
temperature that's a lot better when I
tested that last night it was like 82 83
degrees so it's running 17 degrees lower
than it was before which is really good
so everything looks pretty decent now so
I'm going to start getting things ready
whoo all right so now we're in the BIOS
here I've been playing around with it
for
three two hours now and I've it's really
good like this is an absolute blast of
the past and this is kind of in ways
this is how overclocking should be I'm
just in the BIOS here and I've actually
been playing around this is really
interesting right if you want to get
these CPUs up over four gigs then you
have to lower your qpi from six point
four to four point eight and then after
that you have to give like the qpi
voltage a big bump my max I mean I could
get it I'd ran a Cinebench run at four
point one gig on all cores but that's
pretty much as max as it'll go and the
diminishing returns like after one
hundred and ninety megahertz on the B
clock like here manages goes through the
roof
so even 200 I don't even know if I'm
comfortable running that I'm just going
to still play with it for another couple
of hours and sort of fine tune
everything but it is running at full gig
on all caused pretty smoothly so I'm
going to find out what I'm going to do
so we're just going to play around with
a little bit more and yeah guys so
that's its I mean I'll pull up the
Cinebench score for you guys as well
show you so there's pretty much running
faster than a four 770 K so that's
really impressive for a hundred-dollar
CPU so I mean if you guys want to know
more but I'm still just tweaking
everything I'm learning what each
voltage does CPU PLL that actually
affects power consumption quite a bit on
this platform as well the sad thing is I
never actually got to try this platform
I went straight from the q9 550 straight
to the Ivy Bridge so this was actually
this is really fun this is a lot of fun
so I can recommend you guys you guys
might want to get on this and you know
especially for a hundred bucks so I'll
be definitely making a good upcoming
second hand used computer guide for a
workstation very soon because this is
pretty awesome but anyway I'm still
tweaking this and stuff like that but
man it's a lot of fun it's a lot of fun
so I'm still like finding out what every
single detail does so anyway guys let's
try and just get it playing some games
and do some benchmarks too
we've managed to get to four point one
gigs though I dropped it down to four
gigs to get as stable as it is stable at
four gigs I still got to play around
with a memory a little bit and I got to
put that front 140 millimeter fan down
there as you can see there is no drives
in the drive bays I've actually run
these wires here and sort of flipped
them out the back because it's going to
be my hot plug computer so that's just
because like the last time I brought a
computer to work the kids broke my
bloody windows Password so and then like
they didn't just break it they like
dither a restore point and it just
wrecked my whole computer and wasting so
much time was like yeah I'm not doing
that again so this time I'm going to
carry an SSD with me and we're gonna
have a problem I know I said I was going
to use the hard drive was like now I got
to be x100 line around wise we use it so
anyway let's restart it so we're in the
BIOS now so we're going to just quickly
show you guys the settings that we're
going to use here so run through what we
ended up finishing with and let me know
in the comments do you guys like these
full nerdy vlogs and yes this is a Dell
monitor these things are gone for like a
hundred and eighty dollars - I got one
for 180 bucks delivered it's IPS is
1080p and it's got some of the best
input lag or lowest input lag you can
get from a monitor not only that is the
panel for an IPS panel is actually
pretty responsive - I'll put the link
for the review on the description below
if you want a really good monitor
anyway so let's have a look here we've
got 2,200 on the base clock so I managed
to just pip out I got to 205 206 max but
I managed to I'm just going to keep it
at 200 and see how long that goes on for
but memory ratios for the Ankur Asia is
nine we've got here the CPU voltage
it's practically pretty low from what
I'm reading I'd quickly cross-reference
my results that's not too bad one point
two four on the CPU called especially
since I'm using a pretty random power
supply on this so CPU PLL a voltage we
managed to go just up to eight one point
eight three that's when that got stable
qpi 0.26 and
and voltage actually went flat at 1.5
that was interesting because I went down
to four point one point four eight
because I want to drop power consumption
as much as possible because I don't want
to put too much stress on this power
supplies yeah I don't really trust it
that much but it's one point five a top
down the actual timings on the RAM are
really bad at the moment this is why
I've got to tweak the memory so it's 2n
1111 31 like that's the max it'll go on
the TRS as well so anyway that's that
done and then we're moving down here and
yeah the Northbridge voltage didn't need
much at all like I think it was stable
at one point one but I was just quickly
tweaking and so when I was doing like
when it was almost stable I just bumped
this this and this up these were my last
three results so I mean I still can
fine-tune it a little bit it's just is
worth the time probably not so anyway
that's our save we can say that it's a
number 4 now that's a 24/7 or not we
haven't tested it for 24 hours yet so we
don't even know if it's 24/7 but let's
just jump into Windows and we will run a
Cinebench live for you guys and then I'm
going to go eat some dinner watch some
error because there's a new episode
amazing I'm gonna watch it on season 3
just hooked on it and then now I'm going
to go to bed so I don't even know if I'm
going to edit this video tonight but
it's a vlog so it shouldn't be hard I'm
just going to pop it all together this
is random vlogs you just keep talking
come on computer hurry up start you guys
want to just sit right you're gonna want
to see it from start to finish so we're
going to show it let's go open i-264
let's get it cracking come on Ida I'm
not do sorry just the ace of panels no I
was running some input lag tests and the
Dells I'm gonna give you guys this funny
thing about a vlog you guys can hear
some of my other testing I did this
panel was the fastest panel I've got
here though only through the DVI dual
link port like when I ran this monitor
this Delma
through the VGA port it was actually
slower than the a saw so I'm just
curious to see if I ran the ACE because
the DVI port unfortunately is dead like
the DVI socket on this ace is dead and
so I am like I don't know like yeah
maybe the Acer is faster I don't know
but yeah anyway so we're just going to
run a quick
we actually just changed monitors yeah
just hot switch the monitors we're just
running a Cinebench for you guys I want
to show you how this performs but the
Acer monitor is actually like it was
fight it's pretty fast but the Dells
slower on a VGA port or a HDMI port as
opposed to this one but when I put it
through the dual link port and same with
the Korean monitor behind it I don't
know if you could just see it behind it
that's faster than the Acer as well when
I put it through the dual DVI link port
so I don't know what's going on there
exactly but now it's dual CPU run and
you guys can see this four gigs monster
I should be cpuid as well but yeah I'm
sure you guys trust me so it says there
actually it says there four gigs so
anyway you guys saw all the settings in
the boss so this is it's legit like I'm
actually pretty happy man like this rig
all the parts I mean I did cheat a
little bit but all the parts are
probably like three to four hundred
dollars I should go tally up the cost
and I can sell some of the stuff like
you saw that genius
here it is here this beast GTX 285 I'm
going to try and sell that for a little
bit to some MacBook Pro user or
something
there we go 944 944 legit that's faster
than like a for 770 K for like $60 CPU
like are you kidding me this thing is
just a workstation budget workstation
person's dream I mean like I'll sing
people running at FX 8350 s2 5 gig and
they're only getting 800 like this thing
man definitely tops the cake for value
for money
thanks to my viewers for recommending
this CPU as in Japan I managed to pick
the motherboard up as I said before like
just the whole thing for just an
absolute bargain so that's pretty crazy
anyway so good job I'll be having a
little good job to the viewers thanks
you guys a lot but I'll be having
another video very soon about the about
this whole build like it's finished and
I just got to turn it up and then I'll
actually do a proper guy but this is
just a video log for you guys who wanted
like no no who are interested in seeing
so all the behind the scene the behind
the firing line scenes and stuff like
that so but yeah anyway it's dinner time
and I'm hungry peace out for now guys if
you like this video then please give it
a thumbs up if you like them flogs and
let me know and I'll try and do some
more while I'm testing stuff and going
crazy in here so yeah not too long I
mean I built it this morning and
finished it all up today so it's all
good
when when win-win anyone going now he's
over now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
