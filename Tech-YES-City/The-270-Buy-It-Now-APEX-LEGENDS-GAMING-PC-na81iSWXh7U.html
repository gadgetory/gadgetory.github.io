battle royale game that's been released
on the EA origins platform and the
minimum specs required that you need an
i3 6300 or an FX
4350 for the CPU six gigabytes of RAM
and also a GT 640 or a HD 7770 this game
on a budget but today we're more or less
gonna try and go for those recommended
specs to get a better gaming experience
which state that you need an i5 35 70 K
which is a four core four threaded
processor a gigabytes of RAM and also a
gtx 970 or an i-9 290 so guys what are
we waiting for let's put this PC
together
so here's what I've got so far for this
build now the good thing is about
today's video is I've put together a
list for you guys if you don't want to
go out and look for deals like I've done
here on these parts I've got a list
where I'll put the links in the
description below where you can buy it
now on a lot of these parts and still
get really good deals but first off here
rx 570 I got this for around 50 US
dollars 70 Australian dollars and it's
such a good deal is priced as a 4
gigabyte version on eBay at the moment
you can currently get this for 90 US
dollars free shipping in the US for the
8 gigabyte version absolute bargain and
then we've got the CPU here which is the
ex 34 40 this is for cos 8 threads and
it's overclockable you can pick these up
for 18 US dollars of Aliexpress and then
for the cooler I got this thrown in with
the deal when I was in the USA but
apparently word on the street is the new
meta for CPU coolers is the vowel on
aliexpress for 13 US dollars which would
do a fine job of overclocking this CPU
now for memory forgot here 8 gigabytes
of ddr3 memory I picked this up on a
deal when I was on the road challenging
Christopher Yi in the United States and
then for the SSD they're so cheap at the
moment 20 US dollars for a brand new SSD
that's going to make our system so far
so responsive when it comes to loading
up games and just using Windows and then
we've got the pals play I got this
thrown in with a deal but currently you
can get a power supply for around about
30 US dollars brand-new so if you don't
like risking it with use power supplies
and go with the new option but I've
always dealt with these use power
supplies and they don't present any
problems to me usually fingers crossed
anyway guys I've still got to pick up a
motherboard which in this case we need
an H 55 motherboard I'm getting one on a
deal for 40 ozzie dollars which is about
28 USD but if you can't wait and you've
got to buy one now you can currently get
them for around $49 shipped so there's a
little bit expensive for the motherboard
that everything else on this build is so
cheap that this motherboard really makes
this build worth it and then we've got
last of all the case I've found one for
10 Aussie dollars this is an old-school
case and I actually need one with the
power supply mounted up the top because
our power supply itself has
short cable runs but ever guys let's go
pick up the rest of the pots and make
one epic budget gaming PC but before we
do go get these deals if you want a
website hosted for as little as
seventeen US dollars a year or a dollar
forty five a month then today's video
sponsor hosting is bringing you just
that with over 99.9% uptime included
emails and an easy website builder you
can have something so cheap up and
running in no time for your business
whether you're a young getting into the
game or whether you've got a sole trader
business and you just need something
that's informational out there on the
web hosting have you covered it's that
good that I've recently ported my whole
tech yes City website over to this
service because it's so competitive you
also on the cloud hosting services get a
dedicated machine and a free domain
registration included if you sign up for
one year and what makes it even better
is if you're a tech yes City viewer
they're throwing in 15% off these
already really good prices what are you
waiting for links in description below
but let's get back to those deals
so we just got back to the tackiest
studio picked up the motherboard and
while I was there the person's name was
Nick he also showed me a 7950 which I
picked up as well for an additional 40
Ozzie dollars so that's a pretty good
deal considering I need it for the
legacy BIOS which I believe it has as
opposed to a UEFI bias and then another
lovely viewer donated this to the
channel some thermal grisly hydronaut
for an upcoming comparison with all
different thermal paste but here we are
here with the main prize we picked up
the case and I gotta say not bad for a
banger like it looks pretty good it's
all ready to rock and roll but these
parts even though I've got all the gear
we've got to give it now summat Tyl and
that is tech yes lovin that's where I
get some brake clean a multi-purpose
spray and the data vac hose it all down
clean it all up and make it look brand
new
so some really bad news but I got this
motherboard in and had a tissue over it
now I've actually never seen a tissue
over a socket cover before so I didn't
really expect it to be damaged but then
I took the tissue off and all the pins
were just munted so Nick please never do
this to a motherboard again because Nick
said it was working I took his word for
it and I'm guessing he put the tissue in
afterwards and then closed off the
socket and then didn't really look at it
ever again so I've tried bending all the
pins back they do look pretty decent but
again with that many bent pins all's you
need is a few little micro bends in the
wrong spots and the system won't boot or
at least the CPU won't be recognized
properly so there's only one thing left
to do with this board and that's just
give it some tacky ass lovin
so even after hearin some Tyl and just
trying to have a closer look this is
where the problem is here the top pin is
sort of like missing its head and then
the one below its is completely gone so
that board is officially not with us
anymore I'm gonna have to actually get a
refund at Old Nick and he was like oh
damn my bad I'll give you a refund so
that's okay it's just it's a lot of time
wasted but there is still one way we can
save this budget build and that is to
call up the one the only the king of the
coasts let's go check out what he's got
for us
so hallelujah this build is finally
working but the problem here is is that
this case is well it's so rusty inside
and that fan is just like on its way out
it's really noisy so I kind of blame
myself I should have opened this case up
when I went to buy it and check inside
and just refused it because this is like
two pots now that I should have checked
and there the two pots that I picked up
today and they're just not up to par in
my opinion like they're not even worth
the money I paid like definitely for the
motherboard that doesn't even work and
then for the case like I don't even know
if that's worth ten bucks but anywhere
all that aside let's get some beauty
roll of this thing overclock it and then
finally start installing apex Legends
so we've just finished up doing the
benchmarks on Apex legends and the
results are really good with medium and
low settings 1080p we're getting over a
hundred average fps and the one percent
in point one percent lows are really
good if we want to step it up to high
settings with the RX 570 and this four
core CPU we're getting still over 60
average FPS which is really good we've
played some other games as well Resident
Evil 2 we're getting over 90 average fps
and then shadows of the Tomb Raider in
the benchmark we got over 50 FPS on high
settings so basically this little Z on
here the x34 40 it's no joke it's a
really good CPU even in 2019 playing
some of the latest titles and getting
some really good fps now in all of
today's titles the CPU wasn't going a
hundred percent either which means it
we're still GPU bound by the RX 570 so
that's really good news I'm actually
shocked at how well this CPU does if you
guys want to know how to overclock the
CPU then it's super easy I've made a
whole tutorial dedicated to this
motherboard and CPU combo I'll put the
link up here for you guys what all you
have to do is change a few settings put
a good cooler on it and then you shall
have some great speeds great fps and
more importantly amazing price
performance so there it is guys this PC
behind me is just geared up to play
1080p games even in 2019 with the latest
titles if you want to play csgo
dota 2 league of Legends and this thing
will just easily do so well in those
titles but anyway guys if you enjoyed
today's video then you know to do hit
that like button let us know in the
comment section below what you think of
apex legends have you played it yet I
know my gameplay was pretty bad I mainly
just testing out the parts and seeing
the performance of this particular rig
and this combination of PC parts but
other than that it did really well I
look forward to playing this game it's
actually quite enjoyable and it's free
to play as well Souls you need to do is
go get the PC parts install windows and
in this case I was pretty lucky the
motherboard I got off king of the coast
that had a Windows 10 Pro activated
license already
installed on that motherboard but no
