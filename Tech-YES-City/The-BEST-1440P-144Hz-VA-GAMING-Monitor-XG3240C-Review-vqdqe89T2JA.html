monitor that is definitely drawing the
line with the Great Divide it is on the
side of a gaming monitor so if you're a
video editor or you're looking for color
accurate
this monitor is probably not going to be
for you but if you are a gamer and you
do want one of if not the best gaming
experiences money can buy and on that
note of what money can buy this price
tag is actually not bad at all it's 700
Australian dollars retail though in my
deals video it did go down to 640 or
strained dolls sad news is though
currently it's not available in the US
so when it does get available in the US
I will update the description and I will
ask for you sonic when this thing is
hitting those shelves over in the United
States of America because it is a very
good gaming monitor though with that
aside jump on out of the yes 'mobile if
you're ready on board come over - yes
land and jump on the yes coaster because
today I'm gonna take you through a tool
with this monitor of all the ups and
downs I'm even gonna talk about it
compared to the Samsung 32-inch curved
monitor which is currently out there and
I'm gonna tell you why I believe this
monitor is actually even better than
that monitor so let's get this show on
the road
welcome back to tech yesterday this
brang coming to you guys today with a
review of the XG 32 40 C which is view
Sonic's 144 Hertz VA paneled gaming
monitor now has a curvature of 1800 R
and also will get straight into the
deets as well it's ghosting is really
good for a VA panel there's practically
none and also comparing it against the
IPS monitor it has extremely low input
lag now I did do a few different tests
at a thousand fps and again this is some
of the lowest I believe it's the lowest
on any monitor I've had come through it
input lag that I've seen in my life so
comparing it against the 4k monitor did
do exactly the same at 60 Hertz so I had
to have these duplicated at 60 Hertz but
one thing when it was at 144 Hertz it's
going to draw a frame faster so it could
be anywhere from 8 to 10 milliseconds
faster than the 4k monitor had come
through here and that was already
incredibly good with its low input lag
but one thing you'll notice from this
video piece also is that the ghosting is
better than the IPS panel so this VA
panel is extremely responsive so you've
heard these tales of VA panels being
terrible and having bad ghosting well
this one is definitely different to
those terrible VA panels now keep in
mind there are different overdrive
settings there's five different settings
I like to use the ultra fast setting
though some people will like to use the
faster setting as the ultra fast setting
will introduce a little bit of overshoot
which is slightly noticeable but in my
opinion you will get a more sharper
picture faster does look a little bit
better to the eyes but there was for me
personally noticeable blurring
especially in dota 2 now I use this game
with my own tests that I sort of have
been using for years now it's called the
name tracking test and that's when a
character is moving I like to try and
read that name as it's moving and I
noticed the ultra fast setting was
easier to read than the faster response
time setting and also on that note the
high refresh rates do help out here so
if you're on a 60 Hertz panel you can
load up dota 2 or here is a new s
they're both great MOBAs and then you
can just track people's names as they're
moving if you can't read that name
properly
then I would recommend either getting a
monitor with higher refresh rates or
better response times and or both but
one thing was definite and that was dota
2 was an amazing experience on this
monitor
moving over to csgo high FPS FPS game
double FPS but what we saw here was
again the results were phenomenal
I could actually play csgo really well
and haven't played it for a while so I
got the good old dak dak and I know some
people are gonna hate me in the audience
but got the dak dak and I was getting
some frags on this monitor it was
phenomenal now we did again test the
ultra fast setting versus the faster
setting because I'm really picky about
my monitors and the settings I use and I
found in this game the response time of
ultra fast was a little bit better than
the faster setting and again that
overshoot was slightly noticeable and of
course the last test I did with the
response times was to put it through the
UFO test and my eyes were telling me
what the camera was seeing as well so
that ultra fast setting I believe is the
best in slot for this monitor now for
settings personally you've got 220 CCD
brightness out of the box they do
advertised 250 but the X ray colour
calibrator I have here told me was 220
so dropping the brightness down to 74
gave me 180 this is where I like a
gaming monitor or general use monitor to
be in this vicinity so if you're an end
user you probably want this monitor from
anywhere from 60 to 80 brightness now
you can change the color temperatures on
this monitor you can also change the
color settings individually with red
green blue control and I will say the
OSD is phenomenal too they actually must
have heard my feedback but must have
heard it a long time ago before they
even made the monitor so they went to
the future saw my 4k monitor review and
then they went back in time and they put
in the directional OSD button which
makes things very easy to use so
flicking through this OSD is really easy
you can set three different custom
profiles if you wish to within that you
can set your colors you can set your
saturation levels black levels even your
gamma settings and there is a lot of
different gamma settings too I like it
at 2.4 gamma setting I also like the
saturation and contrast
at their settings out-of-the-box and I
found the colors were very good
out-of-the-box - except for the
temperature at the out-of-the-box native
setting it was very yellowish if I could
say that so I changed this the cool and
it went away now this is where this
monitor does get that great divide as I
was talking about in the intro it is a
gaming monitor so it's not gonna be for
photo accurate work or when if you need
a video edit for instance if you want a
really good video editing monitor check
out my 4k monitor review even though
that's expensive you're gonna get really
good results out of that thing I haven't
had one complaint of someone telling me
I'm looking like a lobster this monitor
however out of the box it does have that
contrast II saturated look so if you
start editing videos on this thing you
may end up looking like a lobster to
your audience and I have had this happen
in the past before so this monitor is
prone to lobstering if you're in the
video editing or color accurate work
although continuing on that note however
my X right color calibrator
did show some results that were very far
off the out-of-the-box settings so
further proving that this is not a color
grading monitor however the black
backlight bleed levels and also the
white uniformity on this monitor were
really good they weren't perfect but
they'll definitely over that of an
acceptable everyday use level I wouldn't
notice this on any application or any
sort of gaming or even movie watching so
really good to see that of course the 4k
monitor that was near-perfect but you'd
want that to be for the extra price
you're paying so what you've got here
with the XG 30 to 40 C is a
out-of-the-box setting that is saturated
that is contrast II that does have those
deep blacks it is phenomenal for the
end-user who wants to watch movies or
play video games and I absolutely love
the look of this thing out of the box
except I'll just of course change the
response time so ultra fast drop the
brightness to 74 and change that color
temperature to cool moving on with some
other features of this monitor it does
support free sync from 48 to 144 Hertz
so very generous range so if you have an
AMD graphics card you will get adaptive
sync technology supported me personally
I don't use any sync technologies
whether it's G
sink freesync I just used NSYNC which is
no sink and I've been doing that for
years I love my high refresh rates
throwing the frames but possible and
we've also got an 1800 our curvature
which is very nice it does add to a
little bit more of that immersive
experience for gaming of course
contrasting that to video editing in
photo accurate work not really the bests
also cross-hatching on this monitor was
non-existent pulling up an orange
background it was very smooth and this
was at the max 144 Hertz setting and
then lastly of course talking about the
build quality itself you've got a very
thin bezel on this monitor though
compared to the 4k monitor there is a
bottom drop there with the view sonic
logo I would have liked to have seen
this have the same frame as the 4k
monitor because I did dual mount two of
these view sonic monitors together for
my main setup one being the video
editing monitor and one being the gaming
monitor but also backing as a second
monitor when I need to pull up files and
I need to drop and drag things into
video editing quick and easy as well as
pulling up support shadowplay on this
computer also you do get a power brick
and 2 meter display port cable there is
4 USB ports on the back as well as 2
HDMI ports and one DisplayPort in there
is included audio the audio is a little
bit tinny I wouldn't really use it
unless you absolutely have to though if
you have to you will get a decent
experience out of it similar to that of
a smart phone though the included stand
was a little bit of a mystery I did like
the build quality it was hide adjustable
up to around about 13 centimeters
it did have a tilt and swivel control
but when we were trying to essentially
change the rotation of this monitor even
at its max height it will hit the desk
so it was a little bit of a mystery
there with the rotation but everything
else on this monitor stand was really
good of course me personally I do like
my monitors sitting very high so if you
did want to use this monitor at the same
height as I did then I'd recommend
putting it on a box or mounting it with
a vase a compatible mount and that's
another thing as well
it does have the screws on the back to
mount this on the wall or on a stand if
you wish to it has in conclusion with
wrapping up the review of the viewsonic
XG
to 40c absolutely phenomenal monitor for
gaming high refresh rate 144 Hertz you
can also drop it down to a hundred Hertz
if you wish or sixty Hertz it does have
a very responsive VA panel now the
viewing angles are very good on this
thing
much better than ten of course a little
bit behind that of an IPS panel though
the colors are gorgeous the black levels
are very deep deeper than that of an IPS
panel and as well the added on benefit
is those response times as you saw in
those tests it was beating that of the
IPS panels very sharp one of the best VA
panels I've seen to date it also got
free sync you've also got complete
control from the OSD to change things
like the overdrive settings you've also
got color control and when we look at
the Samsung variant there is that
Samsung variant that is going around
does feature quantum dots so that is an
advantage that that has but when I
looked at TFT Central's review of it
which they do phenomenal monitor reviews
they said it had no overdrive settings
they also said it was flickering I
couldn't find any flickering on the
vsonic model and also using Samsung
monitors in the past the input lag isn't
the best that's at least with my own
testing so I would go for the viewsonic
over the Samsung monitor any day of the
week especially that overdrive setting
that did it for me
the Samsung does have the ultra low
motion blur though again you're going to
lose brightness I think it goes down to
around about 120 I like my brightness up
at 180 this is where this monitor is at
and it can do all that and it can do it
extremely well so if you're an end-user
you're a gamer who doesn't need photo
accurate or video editing work to be
done on this monitor then this is going
to give you that awesome gaming
experience now of course what about an
ultra wide gaming monitor that's going
to be a divide that you're gonna have to
decide if you want to get an ultra wide
gaming monitor or not me personally
using both the ultra wide gaming monitor
does give you a little bit more of an
immersive experience but the problem is
finding a game that supports 21 by 9
natively is so hard a lot of the games
don't support it and they don't really
care to support it either which is
frustrating so this is where this makes
the XG 30 to 40 see such a good monitor
you're going to get every
Ingle game that goes out on this monitor
is gonna look phenomenal and it's gonna
do an awesome job anyway guys hope you
enjoyed the review of the XG 30 to 40
see if you did then be sure to hit that
like button I've got my new favorite
gaming monitor here and I'm gonna
probably go enjoy some games because the
weekend is coming up and I'll catch you
on another one very soon peace out for
now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
