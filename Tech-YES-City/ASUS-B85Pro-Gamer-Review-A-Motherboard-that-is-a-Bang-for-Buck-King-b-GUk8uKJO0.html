motherboard in my computer and I'm now a
pro gamer like I just lit them - under
Pro gaming because I installed this pro
gamer motherboard welcome back to techie
see this is the rank I'm about to you
guys today with a review of the b85 pro
gamer from a Zeus now if you guys have
followed me recently you'll know that I
put this in my ultimate build guide as
it was just simply a phenomenal bang for
buck motherboard and let's quickly go
over the features of this motherboard
and I'll talk about what I like about
this motherboard and then I'll go on to
a quick mic test for you guys talk about
the audio and then I'll go to a
conclusion so here's the b85 pro gamer
here from a Zeus now this is actually a
new one that I've got I've actually got
two of these motherboards because they
were going out at $80 in Japan where I
live
absolutely phenomenal value for money
considering you get the supreme FX
onboard audio with this motherboard this
is kind of the first time that the Zeus
have put their premium onboard audio on
a budget motherboard and this is kind of
what I really like when companies do
this they give these sort of premium
features couple on things that you don't
really need on a motherboard giving you
awesome value for money for certain
types of segments or target markets in
this case me I don't use our cell light
because I don't I prefer one video card
over not having SLI so taking out SLI on
a motherboard makes a lot of sense for
me because I don't want to pay Nvidia
five dollars every time I buy a
motherboard that's right AMD fanboys
every time you buy any motherboard with
an SLI badge on it you're given Nvidia
money so looking the motherboard closely
though we can see the azusa decided to
go with the red and black theme here
covering up four phases of the vrm with
one heatsink and another four phases of
the vrm with another heatsink this in
total gives us an eight phase-- vrm for
the cpu and looking at the left of the
board we've got two phases which are cut
down for the four banks of memory
they're supporting up to 32 gigabytes of
RAM though it doesn't really matter with
the vrm for the rambler because we can
only with a b85 chipset go up to 16
under megahertz of RAM which is
perfectly fine though even in today's
world of workstation in gaming with a
fork or CPU looking further down the
board we've got for cider three ports
here as well as to solder two ports here
more than enough for the average user
even mean editing videos a lot for you
guys
I only take up three to four SATA ports
on average so that's pretty cool it's
enough solder ports for me I'm pretty
sure it's enough solder ports for most
people out there looking to the right of
the SATA ports we've also got a big
chunky heatsink here covering up the
platform chipset hub looking to the
right here we've got our one PCI 3
Express 16 speed slot here as well as
two extra PCI mini slots there and it
looks like a legacy PCI slot they've
decided to throw three of these on the
board I guess they've got to get rid of
them that's the only thing I can think
of as well as getting an extra PCI slot
down here which can support crossfire I
believe so that's an interesting thing
from a Zeus in this board so looking
down the bottom of the board here we've
got our standard input/output headers as
well as support for for USB USB to outs
over to ports you've got your standard
got a chassis fan there a comp and there
and also a TPM connector there as well
as a clear CMOS header there as well as
an SPDIF
out and a front audio out there as well
now let's look to the right of the board
this is the supreme FX audio now they've
decided to go with Elna capacitors which
are considered pretty high-end in the
audiophile realm so I like the fact that
they've gone with Eleanor capacitors
there you've got a shield on there as
well covering up the supreme FX chip
though ultimately it's just a real tech
1150 as I'll talk about this when I'm
benchmarking the audio for you guys so
moving up the top of the board here
we've got two peers two outs therefore
one for a mouse one for a keyboard we've
also got a HDMI out there as well as an
optical out there for audio we've also
got a DVI port there and also a VGA port
there for the support for the onboard
Intel graphics there below that we've
got four USB 2 outs as well as 2 USB 3
outs and then we've got the Intel eye 2
1 7 V which is a great solution
especially for a b85 chips
this is one of my favorite on board
implementations I'd prefer probably the
i2 one 8v but it doesn't really matter
they're pretty much similar great
solution there for gaming as well as for
workstation application moving down here
we've got support for 5.1 out analog as
well as support for our mic in lining
and headphone outs here as well okay so
here is a quick test of what the
microphone sounds like with no snow
suppression on now for some odd reason
when I first got this motherboard and
when I tested it then the noise was a
lot worse but when I tested it this time
around and I listened to it I was like
hey that actually isn't too bad at all
so my sweet spot settings for the
microphone are generally 50 with plus 20
decibel now it depends on the microphone
you are using if you've got a less
sensitive microphone you may have to
turn that up so if you do turn it up to
30 decibels and you do turn the levels
up higher then you'll find yourself
incurring more noise but for what it's
worth it doesn't actually introduce a
lot of noise which is actually pretty
impressive now let's talk about the
audio out when I tested this with a
variety of rock tracks either from the
80s old-school transformers 1986 I mean
I was just left rocking on these
headphones
I think the impedance actually matches
the headphones a lot better than other
onboard audio solutions do and that will
cause not to have those spikes
especially around 7k so the audio for
this is pretty good though one thing I
will mention is the crosstalk isn't
phenomenal I guess the Achilles heel of
this onboard audio would be the
crosstalk though again for an $80.00
motherboard I can't really critique that
a whole lot let's move on now to some
other things benchmarking this
motherboard I mean power consumption was
fantastic I don't really have any other
b85 motherboards compared to but I will
say out of all the motherboards I've
tested on the BA dhat 797 line basically
the LGA 1150 sockets this has the lowest
power consumption of them all so what
this means is that as Zeus are using
quality parts on the VRM and it's
showing in these results as for
benchmarks I mean how does this
motherboard compare in terms of
performance I'd like to think that
there's not a lot of differences
between motherboards in terms of
performance though for what it's worth
this motherboard performed exceptionally
well especially when I was doing SSD
benchmarks as well as when I did my 3d
mark firestrike benchmarks I was scoring
pretty much the best scores for people
with Zeon's and a single GTX 970 so that
just shows that this motherboard
definitely has what it takes to compete
with even higher-end motherboards like
z97 s and stuff like that so kudos to
azuz for making a great motherboard that
performs well in pretty much all the
areas where I want it to perform well
anyway but that being said let's move on
now to a conclusion where I'll sum up
everything I'd like and some of the
things that I actually don't like about
this motherboard as well so it's
conclusion time and I'll talk about a
few extra things as well things that I
really liked about this motherboard
things that I didn't like as well that I
haven't mentioned earlier those things
that I really like fantastic value for
money I mean a Zeus have got it right
with this motherboard it's got a great
VRM I mean when I did power consumption
figures this thing was just a champion
the board was also staying so cool with
the Xeon at 3.8 gigs
also the BIOS allows me to overclock my
Z on to the max turbo clock which is a
really good thing it was the initial
BIOS revision on this as well so if
you're going to get one of these
motherboards make sure you download that
BIOS revision before it gets taken down
if it is going to get taken down is when
I installed a new version of the boss
essentially I wasn't able to get my
three point eight gigs anymore so it's
cool that you can do that anyway so it's
a great thing that you can get three
point eight gigs higher your max turbo
clock on your respective CPU and it
supports the Haswell refresh is no
problems though I'm not sure about
Devil's Canyon which is more facility to
4690k
and the for 790 K however let's get back
to the motherboard itself the audio out
was absolutely phenomenal especially on
a board that came in at $80 it's pretty
much on par with the asrock extreme 6 X
99 now the mic in it's something that
was not good it wasn't that as pretty
crap actually but I don't expect it to
be good on a motherboard of this price
range and when you turn on noise
suppression which a lot of people will
do the voice was completely audible as
well
the line-in is actually pretty good
though it does introduce some noise
after volume levels of 75 with me having
a mic preamp this is no problems and
generally if you're going to use a mic
preamp you will want to turn that volume
down that was opposed to other better
variants out there you can generally hit
it up to 100 and have no problems and
most other motherboards though again on
an $80 month would I'm not going to
critique that too heavily another thing
that I did like was the subtle red
lighting it wasn't too excessive I would
have liked to have seen him go away with
that and it will as well as going away
with some things like the PCI Legacy
slots there's three of them there which
I mean one of them would have been okay
but three is a bit excessive as well as
the rear HDMI DVI and VGA ports I would
have liked to have seen maybe just the
VGA and HDMI or vice for just maybe just
only HDMI I mean I believe they can cut
down costs even further and then give us
things like a clear CMOS button on the
rear as well as bring the cost down of
this board even further which would be
cool though things that I liked about it
just was a solid board though on that
note of solid boards I felt like when I
was installing the memory I maybe if I
applied too much pressure I could have
broken the PCB so maybe I think I caught
it on camera and I'll see if I can show
you in slow motion so I do think the PCB
is a little bit thinner especially
compared to the gigabyte b85 that I had
come through that thing felt really
solid so maybe they've gone Costco today
or maybe they're cutting costs on the
PCB size in order to make the board
cheaper which is fine with me I mean
just be careful though if you are going
to install things on this board it's not
as strong as other boards that I've
tested on the PCB size so just keep that
and note on other things though I mean
it's just a solid board it looks pretty
good it's got great audio out it's got a
great and I see it's got a great vrm
which are the first three things that I
look at when I'm grading a motherboard
and this three and this motherboard has
just hit all those marks and it's just
cut down like you're not you don't for
those people who don't use SLI you don't
you get that feature for people who
don't overclock you can still overclock
on this board though and you can see
you're not paying that for that feature
to Intel which is a great thing and then
you're paying for less solder ports the
right to use less sided ports so you're
just saving money on this chipset and
that's why this chipset makes a lot of
sense especially for most in-home users
even for people using a workstation
things like I'm doing so ultimately I
like this board a lot and I can highly
recommend it if you can't get it though
the scarcity of this board is
interesting it's actually pretty rare to
find this board at solid prices I mean I
looked in the US and the cheapest you
get this board for 140 USD as opposed to
the fatality from asrock which looks
like on paper it looks like it has
similar features which is only a hundred
dollars so maybe if you're looking for
an alternative then the asrock fatality
definitely looks like a good option as
well so you might want to check that out
but all in all I can highly recommend
this board I absolutely had an amazing
experience with it and yeah I'm just
blown away so this board it just I mean
companies have to do this they have to
say look this is what the end user or
the average average end user wants they
don't want to pay for features that
they're not using and this board I'm not
paying for features that I'm not using
if that makes any sense so it's good I
like it in that regards and kudos to
azuz so if you have any questions about
