right on the desk here we've got a
monitor sent in from a company that I've
actually never had any experience before
with and that is vaio tech they've sent
out their new GN 27c 2 which is 1080p
144 Hertz VA panels it uses a Samsung
panel three display inputs as well
DisplayPort and also to HDMI 2.1 but the
main thing is is this good value for
money it comes in at 240 US dollars in
the US I can't find it for sale anywhere
in Australia but like with always with
the monitor reviews around here we're
gonna go through all the paces response
times input lag all that goodness so
strap on in but I will say before we
strap on in one thing I already found a
useful with this monitor is I can use it
as like a sparring instrument like it's
really lightweight so I can pick it up
in like box with it so it's pretty cool
and here we are with all the testing
done and dusted on the biotech monitor
some things I have to point out about
this panel first of all the overdrive
there's three different settings besides
off so four in total you've got low
medium and fast the fast is the only
setting you would want to use on this
monitor and in fact it's still even bad
at that the average response times were
what we were recording with thousand fps
camera in csgo on transitions was around
13 to 14 milliseconds and now with a 144
Hertz panel you've got around an average
of seven milliseconds before the next
frames introduced which means that you
will see three different images in one
frame on this monitor we just took a
look at the film's monitor and on the
faster setting there it was able to
still transition and it still had a
really fast response time with a VA
panel so this VA panel it may be okay
but the way they've implemented the
overdrive is not that good the input lag
however is phenomenal it's really good
this virtually none total system input
lag was 8 milliseconds on the worst
frame 24 milliseconds on the best frame
so anywhere between 0 to 10 milliseconds
on this panel which is really good but
going through the OSD it's a basic OSD
has 5 buttons
you've got the crosshair as well you've
got only 5 different modes to choose
from there's no real option to make
saturation or change the gamma so it's
very basic there's also free sync
support built into the monitor plus of
course you've got no option for low
input lag it's just set on by default
there's also your basic brightness
settings and contrast settings and your
red green and blues if you wish to
change a color profile towards your own
liking
but of course taking a look at that
brightness setting with the water meter
we measured 34 watts with a hundred
brightness max CCD which went up to 290
and then on 48 which is where I like to
have my monitors 160 ccd this was using
up around 24 watts at 144 Hertz so it
does have low power consumption
relatively low power consumption for a
monitor the curve is 1800 R as well and
moving through some other tests on this
monitor we have the orange background
showing a little bit of visible cross
hatching when
looked at it closely we did get this on
camera so you can see this and this is
at 144 Hertz to change this to 60 Hertz
didn't make a difference so I'm not
entirely sure if this is due to the
matte coating on it which is anti glare
and does have anti glare properties or
if it's the actual panel implemented
itself whether it be B grade stock or
not but moving on with a black
background we've got here
no backlight bleed which is great to see
and the whites were very uniform across
the whole panel slight shift to the
bottom left on this particular panel the
grays and the dark grays as well
matching that now there is no srgb
option out of the box so there's no
profile for that so what you have to do
if you want to calibrate this is you
have to change the settings quite
considerably with my X right device tool
I found that the lows mid and high keys
were all off as well as pretty much
every color so if you're using this for
video work and you needed accurate video
work on a budget
I wouldn't recommend this monitor as it
is a little bit off for colors
brightness and accuracy now moving on to
some other intricacies with this monitor
we have a flicker free panel this was
shown with the camera going all the way
up to 4,000 Hertz exhibiting absolutely
no flicker at all speakers that does
include speakers and they are so tinny I
wouldn't even probably use these for a
Skype call I literally this is probably
the worst because I've heard on a
monitor so do not rely on these for a
regular everyday audio even at a hundred
volume I couldn't really hear much
coming out of these and again it was so
tinny it was like they've just put a
tweeter in this thing
there's no HDR option but that's a good
thing on an 8-bit panel like this I'd
rather save some money and not have that
implemented because I just pretty much
looks terrible on any of these VA panels
that have come through here at the
moment but now moving on to the last
thing we've got to talk about with this
monitor is base amount Abul so you can
take the stand off and then put the
bracket on and mount it to the wall or
another monitor stand which I actually
would recommend if you want to purchase
this even just getting like a ten or
twenty dollar stand because the included
stand is so flimsy the monitor is just
shaking there's no height adjustment
there's no tilt adjustment no swivel
it's just a stand that makes it so
lightweight that as you saw in the intro
I could use this thing as
probably a sparring tool and yeah it's
that light which is weird for a monitor
I just pick this up I was like wow
where's the weight in this and after all
this testing and tinkering this leaves
us to conclusion time with the vo-tech
GN to 7c - you're getting a lot of panel
for your money $240 144 Hertz VA 1080p
27-inch curved as well 1800 our
curvature has good viewing angles
backlight bleed is not noticeable great
white uniformity colors are good but the
response times are some of the worst
I've seen for a 144 Hertz a VA panel so
the implementation of the overdrive just
seems like it's probably not even there
it's just a fake overdrive I don't even
know because we had a response time of
13 to 14 milliseconds and at those times
it can even get a little bit worse than
that and sometimes it's even slightly
worse than that because sometimes you're
seeing three images on one frame so if
you like motion blur automatically on
default when you're playing any single
game at 144 Hertz then you're gonna get
that with this vo-tech monitor I
recently reviewed the Philips monitor
and although it's of course more
expensive it has a much better overdrive
feature and implementation of that now
however the input lag is really good
it's low it's extremely low some of the
best I've seen yet but the build quality
really is the main thing that's stopping
me from making this a solid
recommendation
it is easily the most flimsiest and
cheap feeling monitor that I have had
come through here and actually owned or
experienced in the last decade for
instance when I was using this as well
after testing it there's this little
smell coming out of the top of the
monitor - smells like something's
burning a little bit - and the power
consumption isn't even that high it's
actually really good at 34 watts max and
so now this leads me to the
recommendation of unfortunately no with
this monitor but I can see the appeal of
it it does have a really good panel for
the money but there's just a couple of
problems mixed in the main being the
slow response times even
on the best overdrive setting it's just
too slow in my opinion for a hundred and
forty-four Hertz and that coupled with
the poor build quality I mean just look
at this thing it's just wobbles so
easily and there's absolutely no
adjustments on the included stand itself
leaves me just feeling like they could
have done a lot better even just for a
little bit more and on top of all that
they only give out a one year warranty
with this monitor but let me know what
you guys think in the comment section
below what do you think of the vo-tech
gn2 7c ii would love to read your
thoughts and opinions and I hope you
enjoyed this review if you did then be
sure to hit that like button and I'll
catch you in another tech review very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
