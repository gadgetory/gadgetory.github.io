addressed the yes where you guys ask
questions in the comments and I answer
them as best as I can and without
further ado let's get on with the first
question here from Hara he's asking now
that you're back in Australia how do you
feel about the crashing prices of paths
I guess use parts over here compared to
deals in Japan from a few years ago and
that's a very good question because the
two markets are very different I feel
like Japan for instance there was a lot
of good deals on just random pots and I
feel like there was a lot more variety
in Japan as opposed to Australia where
there's a lot more better deals I guess
on mainstream parts like I Five's i7s
even Rison 1000 g TX 10 series cards for
example and so the two different markets
are different but ultimately I did
in hindsight enjoy Japan a bit more
because it was just more I guess you
could spot out those bargains easier as
opposed to Australia at least now in
2018 it's a lot more saturated I also
feel like in Australia a lot of people
would just chuck these parts out if they
were too unique and they just put them
up for sale and probably no one wants to
buy them as opposed to Japan they just
offload them to the junk store and then
they reflect them for a thousand percent
profit but still nothing because they
give the person ten cents for it and
then they sell it for like a dollar or
ten dollars and sometimes you can really
pick up some good gems but also on the
flipside in Japan for example if you've
got a miner who's offloading ten gravis
cars he will generally not sell them to
the public and he'll just go to a store
and trade them in and be like y'all take
all my gravis cards and then that store
will then sell them for pretty much
close to retail so in a nutshell I think
in Australia can get better deals on
mainstream stuff and in Japan you can
get better deals on sort of more niche
type products
next up tech Canucks says how do you
prefer editing your videos I'm using
DaVinci Resolve I'm finding it fairly
dry to edit videos because there's lots
of cuts I'm needing to do and a little
bit of a silly a question how do you do
but text in a video do you just add text
into the timeline or do you use a clear
screen and add text on that and put it
in the timeline so I haven't tried to
Vinci resolve I've tried Vegas and
there's some things I like about the
software other than
dobe but when it comes down to I work so
efficient in Adobe and because I got to
get a video out every day I just I
literally tried these other editing
programs and I just can't use them I
can't get used to them because I'm so
used to cutting videos in Premiere Pro
that I couldn't use anything else even
though Premiere Pro is I believe it's a
ripoff like they don't improve the
software properly like it crashes still
and it's just the randomest crashes you
try to import something oh no you get
that circle so if you're using Adobe
Premiere Pro if you're using any video
editing software for that matter do put
your autosave on like one or two minutes
I find that alleviates a lot of
frustrations but in terms of adding text
into the timeline oh yeah we just
pressed the T button when we're editing
and we'll just add text and then we'll
make it all fancy you can add effects to
it and so that's pretty easy to do i
don't use After Effects pretty much at
all but I know some other tech tubers
out there do next up here we got SGA he
says have you had any issues with any
Pascal cards where when using any
DisplayPort connector it will cause
artifacts when booting or using the
hardware button to restart the PC in my
case the HDMI connection is fine and
there are no issues when using it
compared to the DisplayPort and when in
general use after boot using it with the
display board is fine I checked the
cable with DisplayPort on my motherboard
and it was fine and I don't know what
else to try any help would be great in
terms of connection ports the only
issues I've had in the past is either
one of three things a you've got
something broken on the Graham Scott
itself or something's faulty and that's
causing the artifacting to it's either
the cable and you said it's not the
cable or three it's actually the port
itself so in the case of this I for
example I picked up some mining cards
recently and the HDMI signal just
wouldn't come out of one of these
graphics cards and so what we needed to
do was just quickly reinsert the HDMI
cord like a hundred times and it started
working again so it might actually be
the port itself maybe it has a little
tiny speck of rust on it or something
like that so you might want to check
that out
try reinserting the DisplayPort cable
yeah maybe 50 50 times see if it fixes
it
next up Lexi's er says what's up with
the constant crackling in this exact
video of yours so he's referring to the
previous episode and unfortunately
during that episode my audio interface
it's rest in peace it's it's
unfortunately we tested it out after
that episode and we found it was not the
mics because we've got two different
condenser mics it was actually the audio
interface that is unfortunately on its
way out and I loved that audio interface
because it's got a compressor built on
it so they're getting really hard to
find and I picked that one up on a
bargain for like 20 USD so it's painful
don't worry it's painful but we've fixed
it now next up here Ernest 10:27 says
have you ever had to help a customer
troubleshoot their PC after you sold it
to them are you responsible for
maintaining the pcs after you flip them
and yes we've actually had quite a few
times where people buy them and it's a
lot of the times at simple things like
they'll plug the DVI cable or the HDMI
cable off the motherboard port instead
of the gratis card and they'll be like
why is the FPS so low so we help them
out with that sometimes it's a rarer
issue where it's actually the customers
fault where they'll actually blow up the
motherboard by sticking a USB port in an
HDMI connector or something has that
happened once but other than that yeah
of course I provide support if someone's
buying a PC of me I provide them support
because if I bought a PC of someone and
I paid decent money I would want them to
help me out if I had a problem you got
to put yourself in other people's shoes
is like a lot of people buying pcs off
you are buying because they don't know
how to build pcs so if they come into
any trouble
it'd just be a good thing to help them
out and in turn that gives you good word
of mouth helps your reputation and and I
guess a good rule of thumb is I mean I
offer three months guarantee on my pcs
but of course I don't guarantee user
error which does happen so in the case
of the person blowing up their
motherboard I charge them for a new
motherboard next up we've got Roman
batchly says what car you driving at the
moment and what are you looking to buy
I'll answer the latter I'm not looking
to buy any other cars at the moment I
have a caller really like it the
the Astra broke down that was my
previous car and now I've got something
that I'm riding off against the business
but I'm gonna reveal that in an upcoming
video because I love this car it's
really cool people who've met me in real
life know what it is and I got it for a
really good deal as well so I'll spoil
it in a video
next up rax he says need more budget PCI
Express Xeon hacks videos yes men much
love from Sweden and much love to Sweden
talking of Zeon's we've got a lot in the
works for Xeon we're talking X 58 X 79
might even try some other stuff people
are recommending I buy some Aliexpress
boards again we've already tried one on
boards but there's some other cool
unique niche sort of boards out there so
it would definitely give them a look try
them out but yes stay tuned make sure
you sub with those notification bells
turned on because you're not gonna want
to miss some of the content that's
coming out no other channel is gonna do
anything like this I promise you that
next up leaky space boot says Brian was
wondering if you have considered having
a few automotive based videos I remember
a video that was posted about two years
ago we were talking about a car someone
let you borrow you seem to be very
interested in cars as well use car
hustle time I think you might have been
talking about the Lancer that was my
brothers and he sold it since then that
was a very fast car it had a lot of
modifications done to it in terms of
cars it I do have a history with cars
especially growing up as a teenager and
in my young 20s lots of history to it
but unfortunately I feel like now in a
straight up driving a modified vehicle
is just not worth it police will defect
you if you get pulled over statistically
you get pulled over a lot more than you
would just driving a normal car normal
looking car it's just really like we
call it in Australia cop magnet and I
it's just sort of ruined the fun back
when we were like teenagers it was so
much fun driving modified cars nowadays
I think the scene is definitely sort of
dropped off a bit and so it's more of a
I guess you've got to look out over your
shoulder and it's like look I get enough
stress having to keep up the work flow I
don't need to dress when I'm out driving
my car but since a lot of you guys do
seem interested in cars then I'll
definitely make a video on my current
car for you and also in that same video
talk about my history with used car
parts hustle there is some history there
don't worry
next up faff dust he says how do you
like your x79 system I desperately need
to know not gonna really spoil the x79
video but I'll give you a teaser it is
my main video editing workstation at the
moment and I absolutely love it that's
the 1680 v2 which is a very rare breed
of zeal so yes I can recommend it but
don't go out and overpay for some of the
motherboards and CPUs and parts
next up Southern Cross Tech says hi mate
just wondering what microphone are you
using for these episodes also are you
recording the audio director the camera
so usually I've got two different setups
for my microphones on previous episodes
of addressed the yes I'd be either using
a bearing of b1 or an M XL I think it's
V 67 G and that was going through my
audio interface and that since broken
down so we're now using my lavalier mic
which is a Stoney lav edge and that's
plugged directly into my sony a7s suit
but usually I love recording audio
direct into the source because I hate
syncing up audio with video post it's so
annoying for me I don't know why some
people can do it easy I just I really
don't like doing it for some reason so
next up Tom Martin and Excalibur they
both talked about the coil whining
crackling in the video we addressed that
earlier it's yeah it's fixed now don't
worry Thomas William says hey Brian love
in this series my question is what's a
good way to keep a brushed aluminium
case looking good I've got my Rison
system in an old sim wave master which
is still going strong you guys should
know the answer by now bit a degrees or
a multipurpose spray a data vac and also
a rag as well does help get the dust off
and if it's that dirty really dirty then
you may want to even consider some brake
cleaner but there's also a limini and
polish if you want to go that extra step
I've never actually used it on a PC case
before because the other ingredients
have worked so well next time we got
Lewis field here says addressed the yes
is FX 6300 still worth it in 2018 and
also a Corsair 650m a reliable power
supply the CX 650 M I will clearly
answer that I haven't had any problems
with CX series power supplies nor for
that matter ever had any problems with
Corsair power supplies in the past we've
even used like vs 350 s on builds that
we've sold here in ours and they work
absolutely fine some people have
reported though that the CX series I
think was the first generation weren't
that good so depends on what series it
is but what it's worth I haven't had any
bad experiences with corset power
supplies so I'd recommend it if the
price is right
in terms of the FX 6300 is it still
worth it you've got to give me a price
point because it depends is anything
worth it it all depends on the price
really if you pick up an FX 6300 for
cheap enough like 10 dolls for example
I'd say yeah it's definitely worth it
next up we've got palsy he says been a
sub since 2016 and love the channel
thanks a lot and also I was wondering
what your thoughts are on the tariffs
that have started in the USA on Chinese
products do you think that Aussies might
be affected at all thanks and keep up
the great work in terms of my thoughts
on the tariffs itself it's one of those
trade offs I mean you guys have Donald
Trump as your president at the moment
and as a very touchy subject and it
looks like the statistics for
unemployment and all the economy is
going very well at least from what I can
tell I don't live in America but what's
the trade-off you've got to pay higher
prices for local goods
it is painful I know but if people who
don't usually buy luxury items are
better off as a consequence of that then
maybe that's better for the greater good
of society again it's a touchy subject
and there really is no band-aid solution
for it so it doesn't matter which way
you go there's going to be pain either
you sell out your country to China or in
the long term you try and fix it but
face the short-term pain and that's
higher prices of local goods in terms of
Australia being affected that's really
not going to happen because we import a
lot of our tech products from either
China or Taiwan directly I believe from
Taiwanese companies direct to Australia
there's no import taxes like GST so
in terms of Aussie prices you may see
them even being cheaper than that of the
USA at least in the next year I know a
lot of companies that want to sell to oz
will go from China to Taiwan and then
export their products now to Australia
to avoid those import duties so it's
definitely not bad being in Australia
for tech products as much as people have
Wednesd about it the prices are pretty
good when you look at the fact that the
Aussie dollar is weaker to the US dollar
and we really pay 10% GST when we
purchase from a retailer
next up phony B he says what is the best
bench testing software programs you use
me
I have Nova and Cinebench what else do
you recommend thanks mate so it does a
benchmarking if there's so many
different programs you can use for me
personally if I had to only pick two
benchmarks to use they'd be Cinebench
and also fire strike now fire strikes
really good it gives you a GPU score
which I find it's very accurate for
giving you a broad measure on how games
will perform with that particular
graphics card and also Cinebench of
course is going to give you that max
theoretical score on how it's going to
perform if a game was perfectly threaded
but also you've got the single threaded
score which will tell you if the game is
only single threaded orientated it'll
relate very well to that single threaded
score so they're the two programs I
mainly focus on of course when I'm
testing CPUs there'll be a lot more
synthetics like 7-zip blender and all
that other stuff that I'll throw into
the mix for you guys but they're the two
main ones that I have that I always rely
on if I'm doing a used build or I'm
stress testing something and I want to
make sure it's running 100% next up here
we got frigo he says hey Brian question
for the next addresses yes what do you
think about the azouz RX 470 mining
edition with only one DVI output would
you buy it and what would you pay for it
also there is any chances of soul during
a haitch d mi to it I can't find any
detailed photos of the PCB I actually
never knew there was an RX 470 mining
edition with only one DVI port that as
with anything is that if the price is
right then yeah go buy one depends on
how much it's coming under retail if it
was like only $10 under retail I'd
probably go for the one with the
reports because in the past I've
actually had a gravis card that's had
one DVI port blow out but you still been
able to use the HDMI port and it's a
very weird problem it's rare but that
big said it it is what it is if the
price is right get one other than that
soldiering on a HDMI port man seriously
I wouldn't try that personally I just
think it'd be a gigantic waste of time
next up here we have Hydra he says hey
peter baelish how do you stay so damn
positive and charismatic in every video
also what have you done with Brian
basically I Peter came in and he casted
Brian off in the game of thrones into
the switcheroonie because he got on I
didn't want to spoil it for you guys but
in terms of staying positive and
charismatic if you guys haven't seen the
health videos we've done already part 1
2 &amp;amp; 3 is basically how I stay so
positive I definitely want to keep up
your diet definitely want to keep up
your exercise and I guess after you just
you go through a lot of bad experiences
in life and I guess it's the mistakes
that you learned from like I've had a
lot of crap happen in my past if you
guys followed me even through the
YouTube days there's just been crap
that's been afflicted on me and I know
the thing is though when I look at it
now even cutting my thumb up really
badly I'm still fine like I'm still a
hundred percent healthy and I'm still
I'm just grateful for having the life
that I have and it's a real weird thing
because there are other people out there
that have been afflicted with much worse
than I have been in the past my stuff is
repairable there's people who come back
from irreparable things whether you lose
a really close one at a young age or
you're permanently disabled but a lot of
these people I've met in real life
they're lovely people and they've still
managed to enjoy their lives so whatever
you do in life whatever situation you're
in try to make the most out of it try
and make the best out of it and live the
best life you can and I guess maybe that
comes through in the videos next up Nash
Goering he says hey Brian I have another
question I recently bought some Rx for
80s when I put them in I'm guessing when
he turns them on and puts them in the
computer they all have error code 43
I've tried uninstalling or installing
drivers but nothing has worked do you
ever get error code 43 if you do how
have you fixed
thanks for the great content I haven't
seen error code 43 but we've had a very
weird problem with our X 480 s actually
in particular where you load up a
benchmark or you load up fortnight and
the whole computer dish switches off and
essentially what was happening was the
software was locking out the rx 480 so
it wouldn't engage the fans so the
temperatures just stuck and so the fans
are just on silent and then they coddle
overheat and lock-in it's a hardware
safety mechanism to switch the whole
computer off and how we fix this was we
installed afterburner set the fan speeds
manually to either 60 or 80 percent lock
that into a profile booted up with
Windows and then every time you boot up
windows it's gonna lock in a manual 60
percent fan speed for example and then
when the games start playing it's not
gonna matter because those fans keep
spinning and you're gonna have happy
days so try that see if it works that's
the only solution I had for the cards
that I had on hand here next time people
got Alessandro Falco he asked have you
tried Aliexpress custom water cooling I
don't think you've done any water
cooling ever since I started following
you but it would fit super well with the
type of content you do definitely worth
checking out thanks for your work so
quite a while ago we did do an eBay
water cooling loop I'll put the link up
here for that it didn't turn out too
well even though it was very cheap but
we do want to step up the budget and I
guess get some quality Aliexpress water
cooling pots but I will do that once
we've got ahead of schedule because I
got this injury but also we've just been
bogged down with a lot of work so maybe
after Christmas cuz I gotta go to CES as
well after Christmas we'll get some
really cool interesting content like
that because I do have a lot of
Aliexpress videos planned for you guys
ordered a lot of cool stuff in there's
also some other really cool use
price-performance stuff coming but also
on that note we've got Darth Jar Jar in
the works that is a custom hardline
water-tube build from Ethan from tag
mods we're teaming up and that is in the
works right now and speaking of backlogs
we've already done the health videos
there's lots of cool stuff that I'm
finally catching up on for you guys and
this one right here I'll Express water
cooling I'll get that done in say
January or February of next year next
time people got paradox designs he says
yet again it's pronounced the Zeus the
same way Pegasus has said
as the company was originally named
Pegasus basically when it comes to it
now Google's algorithm actually
recognizes it as ASIS so when I start
off a review of an azuz product I'm
basically gonna say like for example
today we're checking out the asus strix
20 80 or something like that and then
just revert back to a Zeus because
that's what I'm programmed to do if that
makes any sense because I've been saying
a Zeus since I was a teenager and I was
using tech products next up here Erik
asks hi Brian is it true what they say
about overclocking that it may shorten
the lifespan of your processor or GPU
thanks man love your channel keep up the
good work it is true to a certain degree
it depends on who you're asking
like overworking any component whether
you overworking a car engine or anything
will reduce the life but in terms of
CPUs and GPUs if you're using a computer
a few hours a day like I always
overclock my gear but I don't overclock
it to stupid levels there's basically
sweet spot levels is what I call it
where you overclock it to a certain
point and after that you won't get
linear gains it'll start requiring a lot
more voltage and that CPU will just
start hitting a brick wall it's at that
stage where I do recommend just taking
it down a little bit and then just
having happy days with either your CPU
or your GPU because not only will that
reduce the heat but it'll just help
prolong the life of your components
because heat in my opinion is the number
one destroyer of PC parts I've got lots
of tutorials when it comes to
overclocking GPUs and CPUs if you want
to check them out then just go in the
search bar check your city CPU and then
overclocking tutorial hopefully
something pulls up for you there but in
terms of overclocking just make sure you
watch your temperatures and have some
good airflow good cooling for your
components and you'll have happy days
because the extra performance is
definitely worth it
next up here Elder pass says woo first
and RGB increases frame rates by 1000
fps at 4k so why wouldn't it sell builds
he's referring to the previous sort of
episodes where I said that LED lights in
your computers help sell builds it's a
little trick and I can tell you as they
deftly
but in terms of increasing your FPS
there's no factual evidence I'm just
going by hearsay
next up DIY Tex says some years later we
might be looking at RGB as neon under
cars I've definitely thought about
putting some igb under my car that would
be pretty cool especially if you loaded
up the IQ software could definitely get
some cool effects going on and then
lastly we've got inky Steve he says I'm
61 and I watch your channel when the
nurse lets me make sure you say a big
thank you to that nurse she's awesome

little bit more tech yes City because
