cheap keyboards on either Aliexpress or
eBay saying that they were really good
Bay for money so recently I decided to
buy three of these keyboards and put
them to the test and see if they're
worth your money welcome back to tech
yes City this is Brian the yes man
coming to you guys today with a video on
cheap mechanical keyboard off eBay now
the first contender we have up here is
the e blue
k7 5/3 I picked this off the 25 US
dollars shipped to my door so incredibly
cheap and it features blue switches
which is from a brand called jwh very
weird brand never heard of the switches
before and then the next contender we
have up here is the s100 this features
brown switches and the switch of the
design from a company called a long wire
again never heard of this brand before
and it features unique key caps because
I wanted to try something a little bit
different for my money and then the last
contender we have up here is the zero
this features switches from a company
called C a so all these switches in
these keyboards today never heard of
them before though the first keyboard
we're going to talk a little bit more
in-depth about is the e blue k7 5/3
which comes in at $25 and from what I've
seen the prices can fluctuate between 25
to 35 dollars and now this is a full 104
key keyboard with the numpad on the end
and why I'm going to be recommending
this keyboard is that it is so
consistent I was shocked at not only how
consistently actuation was on the kids
themselves but also how thick the ABS
key caps were for a $25.00 keyboard the
blue switches are from a company called
jwh whom i've never heard of before but
they did the job and did so very well
never missing a stroke and only actuated
after the double feedback on the blue
switch was realized the backlighting was
a rainbow like effect and had a
different color of LEDs through each
rose which went coupled with the
translucent key caps allowed seeing
letters and numbers at night very easy
the keyboard also had four different
levels of brightness and had different
hardware
controlled mode lighting effects and the
anti-ghosting if that proved to be okay
when I did my full yes-man BAM test when
pulling off the key caps the keys
themselves had support on both left and
right sides of the switches which I
believed help with the rigidity of the
key to overall very impressive this
keyboard and easily one of the best blue
switch keyboards I have typed on so not
only is it a bargain but it is a quality
product in itself it even came with a
braided cable and key cap puller on the
rear of the keyboard though the only
drawback to the e blue itself was the
switch is being used and that's the blue
switches which will be very loud so if
you need a quiet switch then you might
want to avoid this keyboard the next
keyboard we have up here is the brown
switched s100 which is a 10 keyless
design and cost 36 dollars delivered to
my door also opted to try out the new
key caps which were a little bit funky
but honestly we're probably not for
everyday typing the brown switches which
have one level of feedback but from a
company called wah wah again never heard
of it but in practice this worked quite
well and when typing I noticed that the
keys were pretty consistent not as good
as the Blues that's still pretty solid
there were some times actuated and
missing the click after actuated but
when they were pressed more than 2/3 of
the way down they never missed a beat
also the anti a ghosting effects work is
intended to and after the infamous
yes-men spam test it again never missed
a stroke the s100 also comes with white
LED backlighting which has three
different levels of brightness and also
has different lighting effects though
not too shabby in practice and certainly
not for the money though I found the
s100 implementation of the brown
switches were not as good as the
original Cherry MX browns so with this
keyboard really what you're getting is a
mediocre keyboard at a budget price and
now the last keyboard we have up here is
by far the worst this is the zero which
came in at 35 USD posted to my door it
is a 10 keyless design with red switches
from a company called CA never heard of
the company and honestly after this
never wish I did as this was the loosest
red switch I have ever typed on in my
life
typos were plenty abound and to top that
off the key caps
with the cheapest and thinnest abs caps
I have ever seen in my life which just
made the keys feel like you were typing
on cloud nine - the nine so cloud zero
the backlighting was a rainbow like
effect with translucent key caps that
had three different levels of brightness
and had different Hardware controlled
effects and modes actuation was a little
inconsistent and the keys had the most
flex out of any keyboard I have around
my house
the last Kinder Surprise again - the
kinder was the fact the zero couldn't
survive the yes man spam test missing
keys regularly during the test
so for $35 in my opinion the zero is not
even worth that
so in conclusion to sum up these three
keyboards the zero well that lived up to
its name scoring a well deserved zero
yes 100 that was pretty mediocre and in
my opinion would be more suited to
someone looking for more of a fashion
accessory that's decent for typing or
for traveling as all the keyboards here
today were pretty lightweight coming in
around 600 to 750 grams in total with
the e blue being the heaviest at around
about 750 grams though the star of the
show was that a blue K 75 3 which really
punched above its weight it's a full 104
mechanical key keyboard and has a really
nice feel to it and the switches and key
caps were really consistent this is the
only keyboard of the group that I can
properly recommend and also if you are
looking for a cheap wrist rest and
aliexpress does have these $4 wrist
rests that work really well in practice
so if you're looking for a budget
keyboard to type on 24/7 and also game
on then the K 75 3 plus the wrist rest
definitely gets the victory out of
today's video anyway guys I hope you
enjoyed this video and I'll catch you in
the next one peace out for now bye
just now do something do something
whatever do whatever so dad man do you
want to try three keyboards today and
then tell everyone which one do you
think is the best yes I would like to do
that
okay keyboard number one just press a
few buttons okay yep
keyboard number two for number two right
okay so which one did you like the best
I like keyboard number three simply
because you don't have to be a
weightlifter to lift it and you've got
the springboard effect fantastic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
