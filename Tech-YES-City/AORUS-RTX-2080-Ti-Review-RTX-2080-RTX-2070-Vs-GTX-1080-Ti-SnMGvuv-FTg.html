r-tx lineup of gravis cards and here on
Tokyo City we've reviewed quite a few
already ranging from the gigabyte to the
Zeus ROG and now here on the table we've
got the Auris lineup which is a step up
from the gigabyte models in not just
ascetics but also build quality as well
as overclocking so these models here
these are the X editions so out of the
factory they will come with a pre
overclock that essentially will make
them faster than other RT X cards out on
the market but all that aside let's take
a look at these cards verse a stack of
other cards in the similar price range
welcome back to tech yes city and let's
get straight into those gaming
benchmarks where we've tested both 1440p
and also 4k ultra numbers which I
believe these three cards here on the
bench will lie in terms of their sweet
spot performance and the first title is
battlefield 5 and here we saw both the
RT X xx and T is coming out in front of
the 1080 TI but also the 2080 scoring of
victory over the 1080i to the Auris 20
ati out of the box does beat the azuz
ROG variant and this is something that
we'll see as a trend going with some of
the other games here also a battlefield
5 we decided to test with our TX off
even though the new cards support this
feature it just really affected
performance to the point where it was
literally a joke but also stepping back
to 1440 people can see the RT X 2070 was
also giving the 1080i a run for its
money and this is a latest in greatest
title and this trend will be up and down
throughout these benchmarks for instance
GTA 5 on the flipside does favor the
1080i at least compared to battlefield 5
in terms of performance getting close to
that of the RT X 2080 GI numbers and
beating out the 2080 in the 2070 and
again however the 2080 ti from Horace is
a leading that scoreboard with that
factory overclocked out of the box with
the FPS gap however between the 2080 Ti
and everything else I sort of widen I
guess that GDD are six with eight times
MSAA on does help this card I pull ahead
by quite a bit
at 4k but now moving over to forza
horizon for we could see at both 1440p
Ultra and 4k ultra results the r-tx 2080
was beating out the gtx 980ti and also
the RTS 2080 TI the horas model beating
the Strix again but beating everything
else and then the RTS 2070 did give the
1080 TI a run for its money and also the
28 even a run for its money and as I
said in the past I do think the RT X
2070 is a great value proposition here
and these titles do show that it is
sweet spot at least in terms of price
performance
moving on now to Rainbow six siege a
competitive multiplayer title and we
finally fixed the inconsistencies were
getting with these benchmark numbers and
that had to do with the taa setting in
anti-aliasing and a 1440p ultra we saw
the 2070 coming awfully close to the
1080 Ti and then also 2080 pulling ahead
but then when we went to 4k we saw a big
stretch between the 20 atti and
practically everything here on the
benchmark suite and of course that hora
speeding out the irish tricks yet again
out of the box and now moving over to
Assassin's Creed origins and 1440p max
settings we saw the 2080 beating out a
1080i and then sort of the 2070 coming
close and then of course stepping up to
the 28 ETA that did score quite a
victory but I was kind of surprised I
thought the 2080 did pretty well here
out of this range just like Forza
horizon for I thought it was coming a
little bit closer to the 20 atti than it
was to the 2070 so what's kind of
spreading its wings in this title yet
again and so moving up to 4k showed
similar results so the Auris 28 he was
going very hard at least out of the box
and we'll talk about the overclocks a
little bit later because it is quite
interesting but it is sort of redeeming
the 2080 at least in its difficult price
performance spot but movie I would call
the duty black ops 4 we saw a 1440p the
2080 beating that of the 1080 Ti and
then of course the RT X xx atti beasting
pretty much everything but when we look
at the for Kane umbers the 1080 T I did
score pretty much a tie with the 2080
and then the 2070 was coming a little
bit behind but still beating that of the
1080 so for the games when it comes to
GTX 1000 series versus RT x 2006 it
depends on the game and I guess a
general trend that you will see is the
old of the game I guess the more it'll
favor the 1000 series in terms of price
performance but when we move to newer
titles that's when the RT X mm to pull a
little bit ahead as shown in some of
these synthetic benchmarks here we'll
pull up
first of all fire strike where the 1080
TI does do pretty well in this
particular benchmark beating that of the
2080 by a comfortable margin but the 27
t does beat that still of the 1080 in
this benchmark and the 2080 ti does beat
that of the 1080 TI the overclocked
numbers here and this is where I'm going
to show all the overclocks showed that
the horas card was beating the Strix by
a little bit but out of the box you can
see that the numbers on the Auris x
series cards across all lines here on
the 20 70 20 80 and 28 ETA were favoring
them with
prefatory overclocks which are a little
bit aggressive especially on the 2080
which we didn't get that much out off in
terms of core clocks the other to the
2017 also 2080 a we've got over a
hundred megahertz boost the 2080 we had
to get only ninety-one megahertz on
total boost hence why in those
benchmarks in some titles it was coming
closer to the TI model than it was to
the 2070 but when we move over to time
spike stream for example this is where
the r-tx cards really shine compared to
the ten series cards pulling comfortably
ahead with the 2070 surprisingly coming
very close to that up to 1080 TI and the
overclocks here on the 2070 in
particular were quite impressive also on
the 28th e TI and the RT x 2080 not
going as high as the others in terms of
actual margins so basically now with the
performance numbers all three of these
cards are very impressive and they've
got massive coolers on them one point
four or five kilos for the 2080 ti that
also features a 16 + 3 phase vr m and
then we move to the 2080 that's got a 12
+ 2 phase vr m on a twelve hundred and
fifty gram total weight and then the 27
t has 150 grams and that has a ten plus
two phase vr m so they're all built with
beefy coolers in mind you also get a
four year warranty on all three of these
cards so Oris have definitely stepped it
up like gigabyte have and they're
putting their money where their mouth is
they think they have a superior product
in all ways shapes and forms and pulling
up the temperature numbers here the 2070
did do very well with this cooler they
got three 100 mil fans and even at a
hundred percent fan speeds they weren't
getting that loud it wasn't that
annoying I'd say 60 percent is really
quiet it's the quietest 60 percent I've
ever heard on any graphics card but also
stepping it up to 80 percent I fell over
20 ATT I did need 80 percent in order to
keep the temperature under control the
other two cards however were very
comfortable at 60% and then if you left
it on auto especially the 2070 that was
getting 43% this was just totally
whisper-quiet
and of course the biggest thing of this
graphics card to talk about is those
three ring blade LED fans and honestly
they're one of the coolest looking
implementations of RGB I've seen in the
long
you can customize the profiles with the
Auris engine and make three different
colors in the tribe blade and it does
look really gorgeous at night so if you
do want to vertically mount one of these
grabs carts then they will look really
cool inside of any build and we also saw
them in packs for example in the C T and
T built in Alex from simple mods builds
and they were looking very schmick so
you don't get the bling with these cards
aside and also the rear also have the
RGB Taurus logo which you can change in
tandem with the ring blade fans and for
the rear of these cards the input/output
is very impressive even though they've
gone away over the DVI port they have
accounted for that with three HDMI outs
as well as three display outs and a USB
type-c which will support display as
well so that's seven ports in total
across all three of these graphics cards
making the 2070 definitely a great play
if you need a lot of output there's also
some other things to talk about with
this card you get an included GPU
support bracket as well as the fact that
the PCB itself they've made a note that
they use aerospace-grade PCB material
which essentially makes it moisture
proof as well as dust proof so if you do
put this in a water cooling build and
you have a water loop that leaks these
PCBs here will protect you against a
short-circuit which is a very good thing
to have if you're going full enthusiast
but beside all that here's conclusion
time and I guess we're going to get down
to the question of first of all with the
2080 ti Oris versus the ROG Strix which
should you go for and why I think
they're both going to come in with a
premium in terms of their price points
this actually isn't the sale in the US
yet I can't find it at least anywhere at
least on Newegg or Amazon in Australia
is coming in at two thousand one hundred
and forty nine dollars which is a step
up above even the gigabyte 2080 TI for
example so if you do want to pay that
premium you will get a bigger cooler you
will get a beefed-up PCB with more
phases you also get a pre overclock out
of the factory if you get the ex Edition
as well as some other cool things like
RGB ring fans hundred mil fans and the
stand but in terms of the ROG Strix
itself that has I believe a heavier
cooler
kula and I believe when you're
overclocking both these models it will
run a little bit quieter so I believe in
terms of comparisons between that and
this your overclocks really aren't gonna
go that much higher on either model I
guess it's going to come down to Silicon
Lottery but what you will get on the
Strix is a quite a fan speed at least
for handling the temperatures and then
on this I believe you'll get a better
aesthetic with some really cool RGB
bling but as for the two cards that are
available in the US there's a twenty
seventy and the twenty eighty and just
like the gigabyte 2070 I really like the
Auris 2070 it's coming in a 599 US so it
does have a premium at least over the
current price of the gigabyte variant
that also has a four year warranty so I
was pretty impressed with that but this
one you get a beefier cooler that will
run so quiet and will be overclocked out
of the box with some very impressive
numbers as well as getting all the bling
and the inputs and outputs on the rear
of the card seven in total in Australia
to set you back 1039 AUD and then move
over to the 2080 that's a similar story
to the 2070 except you get more power
and at least in this sample that we got
here a more aggressive overclock did
have a power limit of one hundred and
twenty seven percent twenty eight et I
did have one hundred twenty two percent
and this only unfortunately had a
hundred and nine percent so I would like
to see the limits lifted on that perhaps
nvidia has deliberately limited the 27 t
has to not make it too good a value for
money a proposition but the twenty
eighty definitely performs better than
twenty seventy it also costs more coming
in a 789 us and then also in a stray of
fourteen hundred and sixty two aussie so
I will have to critique the Aussie
pricing at least on both these models
here it is a little bit more expensive
than I'm used to seeing at least when we
compare the Aussie dollar to the US
dollar in relation to what people in the
US can get these gravis cards for but
lastly in terms of these graphics cards
the Auris lineup is the premium option
the gigabyte is your value for money
option and I can say after spending a
quite a bit of time with these I am in
love with these RGB ring-like LED fans I
think it's something that's really cool
but also Oris themselves have done a
really good job of keeping the thermals
under control as well as the over clocks
out of the factory are rock-solid now in
terms of also before I get on any of the
twenty atti Auto
overclock a new feature that's been
introduced with the RT x-series was that
it found an overclock that really wasn't
that much better than this one out of
the box also my manual overclock beat
both the out-of-the-box overclock and
also the auto AI overclock by quite a
bit so that's anything to go by if you
guys like manual overclocking definitely
go for it and extract more performance
especially with weather conditions being
a summer or winter
you should always set a winter overclock
versus a summer overclock and get the
most out of your hardware but also know
I didn't answer the question completely
what I picked this all this ROG Strix
and you can't do that to me guys you
can't put me on the spot I'd honestly
just pick whichever is best for you I
honestly I love the ring fans they just
look so cool what what am i becoming in
2018 you are becoming an RGB fanboy
Brian you need to stop now before it's
too late anyway if you enjoyed today's
video be sure to hit that like button
and let us know in the comment section
below what you think of the new Oris
cards and their RGB bling well as the
performance and feature said love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon these are for now
