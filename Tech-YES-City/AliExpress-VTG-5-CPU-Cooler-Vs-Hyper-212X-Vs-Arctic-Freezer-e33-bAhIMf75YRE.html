been touting this cooler right here the
VT g5 which is an ollie Express special
you can get it for at least you could
get it for $25 now the price has gone up
to around about $34 does come with two
fans and it is a beast at least when I
tested it on a 3770k in the past I could
get that 3770k up to four point eight
gigahertz and it was in less than ideal
temperatures in terms of ambience now
we've got two other choices here of
course the cooler master 212 hyper 212 X
$30.00 shipped to your door from Amazon
so it does come in a little bit cheaper
down in the VT g5 and it's been a staple
cooler for years this thing is pretty
much the go-to recommendation when
you're looking for a really good value
for money for an air cooler and of
course last of all we got here the
Arctic eSports freezer 33 now you can
get this in different color schemes it's
black and you can get the white cooler
that they sent out here you can get it
in a green also I believe that's a blue
and some other colors available now this
comes in also at $30 now the good thing
about this cooler is it will support am
4 out of the box so you can install this
have no problems with a Verizon 5 1606
core for example and get some pretty
good overclocks of course though people
are wondering which one is the best in
terms of performance how well does it
cool well today I'm going to be throwing
all three of these coolers on a 70 900 X
at 4 gigahertz because of 4.5 gigahertz
I pretty much know that all three of
these coolers will get overloaded with
that amount of heat and pressure
however at 4 gigahertz our juices around
about 160 to 170 watts so it is a pretty
intense benchmark still for these three
coolers and of course we'll see how they
hold up now another one you guys have
requested is the vtg 240 ml water cooler
these things about 58 dollars shipped to
your door comes with two fans included
but of course people hearing about how
good the vtg 5 air cooler is they wanted
to know if the vtg water cooler will do
just as well or even better of course
since it's a water cooler it cost more
is it going to perform better now also
I've thrown in the H 110 i GT from
corsair of course it's a lot more
expensive than all the coolers I'm
featuring here today but it is a bench
and laced in the past when I've tested
this it's been pretty much the best
all-in-one cooler you can get so how
does it all fare let's get on with those
results welcome back to tokyo city this
is your yes-man Brian come and do you
guys with the cooler comparison one
might say it is a cool comparison but
anyway let's run these benchmarks what
we got here 40 minutes after testing in
i-264 now one thing I will point out
these are delta adjusted results because
I've got no aircon in the studio at the
moment I did have to adjust the
temperatures with the ambient
temperatures throughout the day so what
you're seeing here is sort of like as
close to the gets to apples-to-apples
comparison when it comes to changing
temperatures throughout the day with
ambience but also we tested with I 264
and the reason we test without a 64 at
least around my channel is because I
believe it's really a good real-world
benchmark to use when you want to get
the maximum temperatures for things like
people editing videos in Adobe Premiere
Pro well people just gaming on a CPU
intense benchmark that utilizes all
those cores and threads of course people
would be like well why don't you test
with prime95 I found prime95 just to be
an absolute monster in terms of how much
power can draw out of a CPU especially
if that CPU has SMT or hyper threading
so kind of not really that real-world if
you ask me when it comes to prime95 with
that aside what we saw here was the VT
g5 air cooler it did indeed win on those
benchmarks it came in with a max
temperature of 77 degrees of course with
one fan off it came in at 83 degrees so
did lose a bit of its edge when we took
off one of those fans what you could see
also with the noise it was a little bit
noisier than these other two coolers
here on the bench I'll let you guys take
a listen
and next up here on the test bench we
had the eSports freeze the 33 from
Arctic
so with Arctic they do make really good
GPU coolers in the past I've used them
on my graphics cards for example that
have had reference coolers and the
results have been a phenomenal I was
really surprised to see this coming in
at 78 degrees so there's only one degree
Delta adjusted hotter than the VT g5 but
it made a lot less noise I'll let you
guys take a listen so with the freezer
33 you get the aesthetics you also get
the performance and now it's funny
because when I first tested this cooler
I thought it was gonna come in last
because it was the smallest cooler but
when I started weighing up all three of
these coolers this one weighed in about
700 grams with the fan attached the v2
g5 with one fan attached weighed in the
ground 720 grams and then the cooler
master 212 ex came in about 580 grams
though the weight wasn't too much of a
problem with the 212 actually might
think as always a little bit less it
will perform less as well but that came
in at 79 degrees
Delta adjusted so the performance was
really good on the cooler master 212 X
as well I'll let you guys take a listen
to the noise as I believe it was the
quietest out of all three of these so
when it comes down to it between all
these three air coolers they all did
exceptionally well I can recommend all
three of them I would like to see the VT
g5 calmed down a little bit in price I
loved it at 25 dollars especially
internationally shipped $34 shipped
around the world it's still a really
good deal for people in remote areas
that can't get access to these other two
coolers so it still gets a
recommendation I just like to see it
dropped a little bit in price the
eSports Freeza 33 $30 exceptional value
for money except for one thing I didn't
like the mounting system with the fan I
thought it was real tedious if you
couldn't get your head underneath and
installed the actual fan clips it just
kept coming off it was very hard to work
with when the test bed was already set
up and I was trying to put the cooler
and so if you are installing this on a
new build get your cpu in there
get this cooler on first thing before
you insert your memory or you do
anything like that as for memory
clearance I believe it all three coolers
kind of did have a little bit of a
problem here
fitting on that raised vengeance led
memory also that that aside we've got
the V T G water cooler 240 millimeters
this thing really didn't impress me at
all I was surprised because the v2 g5
air cooler did really well but this
thing didn't do that well at all I was
kind of shocked it did it came in very
quiet I'll let you guys take a quick
listen to the noise before a water
cooler it was really lackluster and also
I didn't really like the build quality I
thought the pipes attaching the actual
CPU block to the radiator were very
flimsy so I would kind of recommend
avoiding this one if possible also the
LED fans however did look exceptionally
good those ring glow fans did look as
good as they look on camera they just
look beautiful but they only come in
blue I believe so 57 dollars at least
that's where you can get it for if
you're game enough you can try one out
I'd recommend maybe upping the fan
speeds because all these four coolers
out of the box even the H 110 as well
and we get onto that in a second they're
all tested without at the box settings
now with the H 110 I of course that's
what you can expect when you pay three
fold these air coolers of course it
gives you better performance it does
have that extra Headroom but of course
it does cost more and that's about it
for today's video
I did buy both the v TG coolers off
Aliexpress I will put the links in the
description below
Arctic sent out there freezer 33 for me
to take a look at so thank you for
Arctic and if you enjoyed this video
then be sure to hit that like button and
let me know in the comments section
below
which of these coolers you liked the
best out of the bunch and also I did
have to buy the hyper 212 X which I'll
be putting in a client's build in the
near future anyway guys that's about it
for me today and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
