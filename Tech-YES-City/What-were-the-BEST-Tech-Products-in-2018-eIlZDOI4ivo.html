worst tech products of 2018 if you
haven't checked that out already I'll
put the link up here but today is the
best products that I've come into
personally whether it's a value for
money play or it's just a really good
product in general and for instance the
first value for money play here is the
risin 5 2600 this comes with a cooler it
has six cores 12 threads decent IPC and
atop all that off you can overclock it
on budget be 350 motherboards the value
for money here was simply phenomenal and
it still is right up until this
Christmas date coming in at around about
160 to 170 dollars or if you know
straight you can pick these up as low as
210 ozzie dollars this is certainly
going to be a CPU that'll please you if
you are building a new PC though what
else is on the yes list let's take a
look
welcome back to techy a city in the next
product that I came into in 2018 was the
Intel knocked the Hades Canyon version
with the RX Vega integrated graphics
this was simply phenomenal in that it
wasn't so much a value for money play
but it was more so a convenience thing
if you guys noticed sometimes I'll
travel overseas I'll be doing vlogs and
I'll need to edit this 4k footage on the
road fairly quickly and the nook just
gave me for cause eight threads that was
able to be clocked quite high but then
we coupled that in with the Vega
graphics and then I could do other
things as well like OpenGL support in
Adobe Premiere Pro but also on top of
that if I needed to play a game on the
road I could get 1080p gaming on this
small package that was easy to fit in my
backpack and it just packed some serious
power and portability next up on the
list is a product that came in early
2018 and it just changed my life like
literally it saved me so much time when
it came to cleaning up used builds and
this was the data vac it's essentially a
strong electric duster and it's also
anti-static as well so for those people
who go crazy over static discharge this
one isn't gonna do anything so it was
safe but it also just saved me so much
time when I was cleaning up PCs I even
developed a method where I was using the
data vac and degreaser at the same time
and it was just getting such a good
finished product that was honestly
looking better than brand-new the data
vac intern gave way to the term tech
yest loving but also I noticed that on
bit Wits channel he was a secret lover
of this and finally came out of the
Woodworks and told people that this was
a good product currently now however the
problem with the data vac is it has gone
up in price substantially from when I
first started using it but if they do
come down to $80 or under then they're
definitely worth picking up if you like
to clean out your rig every six months
or if you're building and flipping PC's
a lot next up is the apu solution from
AMD this is the Rison 2200 g it came in
with 4 cores 4 threads and it honestly
offered phenomenal value for money for
someone who just wanted to make a small
compact machine
whether it be a home theater PC or a
gaming PC that could play easy to play
multiplayer titles for instance it could
play fortnight at 720p it could also
play counter-strike at 1080p and also
dota 2 this was a nice little unit
especially since it came
and what made this APU even that much
sweeter is it comes under $100 also
comes with a cooler and it can be
overclocked moving on with the list
isn't really a value for money play this
time around but more so a cooler that
impressed me so much just out of the box
and that was the H 15 IR GB platinum it
basically comes with two magnetic
levitating fans that are super quiet out
of the box I was surprised I couldn't
even hear these things when we turn the
cooler on and this was on a 99 hundred K
also when we overclock the 19 100 K to 5
gigahertz the fan still remained super
quiet just like they were in idle and
this made for good over clocks but also
ridiculously low noise also personally
liked the look of the implementation of
the RGB itself however the price tag is
a little bit expensive for an all-in-one
but it's definitely a product that
impressed me next up here is the NASS
that came through the studio this is the
azuz 280 4004 and unfortunately I can't
actually find it for sale on Amazon or
all on static ice in Australia at the
moment but it is a really good option
for someone looking for an ass that has
good value for money but also has a
really good feature set for all the pcs
that come through the studio here even
my workstation included we just simply
install the control center app and then
the nasa is hooked up to that particular
pc you can then start sharing files and
it just is super smooth it's never
dropped out on us and the best thing as
well as if you need faster than 1
gigabits per second speeds it's got the
option to essentially bridge the
connections together to give you 3
gigabits per second everyone with
another reduced product that's more of a
premium monitor this was the XG 35 this
is a 100 hertz 1440p ultra wide VA panel
and when i put it through the motions it
was just good on every single aspect the
input lag was phenomenally low the
response times were very good for a VA
panel and furthermore when it came to
the column modes implemented into the
monitor itself it just had this one mode
called cinema mode that really just made
everything pop watching youtube or
movies and then going over to gaming
everything
looked ridiculously good on this monitor
in terms of value for money you'll
probably find cheaper ultra-wide 1440p
monitors out there however this one in
my opinion is just a cut above the rest
move through the list was the corsair HS
70 wireless headphones now I'm not
usually into gaming headsets and usually
most the time they have porous sound
quality than any typical audiophile
headphone at the same price
however this headset came in and it was
just really good value for money but it
actually had really good sound coming
out of it too not to mention it was just
super comfortable the wireless option
makes it really handy if you need to
walk around without a cable and then the
included tinny microphone made it so you
could talk to people on skype or your
favorite games but if you did want to
use this for professional recordings
they're not definitely get a nother
microphone next up is a product that was
released over seven years ago but even
to this date it's still for sale and you
can still purchase it and I purchased
mine in 2018 and I started using it and
honestly it is the one tech product in
the studio that just gets the work out
every single day and this is the
Logitech Z 906 surround sound setup you
currently get these in America for under
$300 in Aussie you can expect to pay
around 350 ozzie delivered and it's a
5.1 setup with a dedicated subwoofer
that really shakes the house not to
mention if you're editing audio in
videos these are very accurate for
getting a good balance in terms of the
colouring of course they are a little
bit treble heavy but you can always EQ
that out with software and honestly with
these speakers I just enjoy them so much
and I don't even consider myself an
audiophile I just literally listen to
80s rock while I'm building a PC or if
I'm in front of my computer I'll be
listening to more 80s rock and even if I
want to listen to a new-age rap song or
a bit of EDM this definitely can deliver
all single formats of music and sound
really good next up on the list is a
blue Yeti nano this came in and at first
I thought it was decent but the more I
use it and the more I appreciate it the
more I realize it's actually a really
good buy if you need a microphone for
voice over work or for streaming or for
traveling especially and this is where
it comes into my workflow really well is
that it's a small
impact unit but the voice coming out of
it is really accurate and it's nice and
warm it doesn't sound tinny or anything
like that it's also got a built-in ADC
and DAC so you can use it with a pair of
headphones to supplement poor onboard
audio but on top of that it won't break
the bank
either coming in under a hundred dollars
and then the last product here really
isn't for enthusiasts tech but it's more
for people who maybe want to film or get
into YouTube or making videos and this
is the a 6300 from Sony and actually I
filmed this I interchange it with the
a7s2 and no one's noticed to this date
that I've been switching around the
cameras and so this is a camera that
comes in under a thousand dollars as
opposed to the a7s2 which comes well
over two thousand dollars it also
carries a 1.6 crop sensor has a wider
range of lens to support it and the
built in a DC if you just want to plug a
lavalier microphone straight into it
will give you decent voice quality
anyway guys hope you enjoyed today's
video and this wraps up all the tech
products that have come through here in
2018 that have impressed me let me know
in the comments section below some other
tech products you've come into that have
impressed you and why has a love reading
in thoughts and opinions as always also
if you've got a spare few seconds
hitting that like button would be much
appreciated and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now but I didn't know my air 540
could talk to me no look dude look when
I bought you I didn't know you could
talk to me I'm just going to see us like
gonna check out where they got maybe
there's a successor to you with a bit of
tempered glass on G being stuff this is
kind of getting a little bit weird I'm
out man good night
