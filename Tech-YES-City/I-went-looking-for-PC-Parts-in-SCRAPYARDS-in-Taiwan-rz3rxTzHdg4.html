what's their plans for it they're just
selling the aluminium and copper out of
it basically they get it for dirt what
about all these printers and TVs same
thing these TVs and monitors are broken
so because of that they use it just sell
the gold if they can't find an easy way
to fix it and make more money then they
just toss it okay in those cases over
there there's packed full of parts yes
so they just haven't gone to them yet so
they're going to pull them apart pretty
much either they're gonna build them and
sell them or yeah okay interesting if
you guys have followed us for a while
you know that I love yous price
performance and since I'm over in Taiwan
for a big event called Computex I came
here a few days early to look for use
price performance but after I finished
the deals hunt which I'll put the link
up here if you haven't seen that already
it then gonna be thinking about going to
recycling centers and I'm now here at
the first location where this is a
completely different thing altogether
what these locations do is that they
simply work off volume and in that
they'll just get a heap of parts that
are simply untested and they will go
through them so quickly and test if they
work if they don't work then they will
use them for scrap metal and try and
also get the gold off those particular
parts and the first location I'm at here
now is the part where I'm coming to and
I'm simply going to check it out see
what parts they have inside and also
analyze everything inside this place to
see how they exactly operate and what
the conclusion is if anyone wants to
come over to Taiwan and try and get used
parts from recycling centers put that
aside let's go find out what this place
is all about
so here's the hard drives that they're
testing out now they're using a program
called M HDD and this is just running
through and checking essentially the
health of the drives so if they come out
and pass the tests and they're healthy
then they can then resell them but also
whilst they're doing these tests they're
testing out a different power supply
they're also testing out a different CPU
motherboard and memory just for
longevity so some of those coolers that
you see in mass on sale on eBay or
Aliexpress for example this is
essentially where they come from and now
if they don't sell them over long
periods of time they then melt them down
for the scrap metal and that right there
ladies and gentlemen is an old AMD LGA
socket pretty cool when you think about
it so this is the test bench over here
and this is where they test the products
out but also show the potential
customers if they work or not and the
customers can then confirm if that's the
board they want and if so then you come
to a bargain but this store here is a
little bit different they essentially
work off weight and they'll buy in
volume off much bigger centers that
don't even have time to test this stuff
at all so this is essentially the
middleman I guess you'd call it in
between them selling to other computer
stores or selling direct to the
customers so we just finished up inside
and the place actually doesn't even have
an official name so I don't even know
how to name it I can show you guys the
location on the map if you want to come
and check it out but I ended up picking
up three motherboards which were LGA
1156 and they tested them on the spot
but they also did a really good price
because I said to them look I'm going
back to Australia
very soon no risk sale so in other words
after I take these motherboards out of
here I can't claim anything back in that
when I get them back to Australia if
they don't work anymore then I'm Sol but
that being said they took the cooler off
one of the motherboards they sold me and
I was like oh could actually use that
cooler and they said no we're actually
not going to give you that cooler
because we can use our for scrap metal
so the ideology behind here is just
simply we sell what works and we sell
what doesn't work and they go through so
many things every day here testing out
hard drives testing out memory testing
out motherboards so I was actually lucky
that I scored these three boards for a
grand total of 1,400 NTD which would be
about 40 US dollars
the three motherboards that all work but
that's the first location we've been to
now let's go to an even bigger recycling
center and see if they have any good
deals that I can get or find out what
they're all about so right beside me is
now the epicenter of where a wholesale
deal starts this is essentially ladies
and gentlemen a scrapping center in the
middle of Taiwan well it's actually
about 40 minutes outside the city but
this is where trucks will come in with a
heap of different junk and of course
some of those being used PC parts and
then way the truck in and then after
they dump everything on the way out
they'll weigh their truck again and
they'll get paid the difference in
weight per kilo
so from these places people like me for
instance or businesses may come in and
then bargain for these use PC pots but
let's take a look at what they've got
inside and see why exactly a place like
this can be so good to get a deal so
right here we've got a heap of hard
drives a lot of these look like they're
just simply exposed to the open weather
and so once they get rained on a lot of
these micro electronics will no longer
be any use but the good thing is a lot
of these computers even if they do get
rained on if their CPUs inside they'll
still be salvageable and some of the
components in fact will be salvageable
as well but this in the meantime looks
like some of these parts may or may not
work but we're gonna talk to them very
soon and see what we can get so the
first PC we're pulling apart here they
just given us a screwdriver and they
said look you can check through all
these different systems and basically
what we're gonna do is start pulling out
some of these parts and then we can then
barter with the individual who owns this
yard and work out a price so what we're
going to do now is actually pull apart a
few different systems and since I do
this quite a lot I'm not to look out for
the first thing we're going to do is at
least make sure it has a Windows 7
sticker on the computer that way we know
it's hardware isn't that
old with that in mind we've got this H
55 motherboard that were pulling out
this is essentially the juice of this
build the case is pretty much worthless
the power supply is really mediocre but
the motherboard itself is definitely
worth a few dollars so that's the first
system we're gonna see what they'll take
for this and then after that if the
price is right we'll then pull a few
more systems apart and see what we can
get another very valuable thing on these
systems is the windows 7 pro licenses
they can essentially be upgraded with in
tandem the motherboard that you pick out
of the system to Windows 10 Pro and
yuvan now got a refurbished system with
a legitimate Windows 10 Pro license
going through some of these parts here
these are essentially worthless right
something like this is definitely not
going to work as it's been heavily
rained on since this area is exposed to
the open nature and with that when it
does rain some of these pcs are going to
get quite damaged however the main
purpose of a place like this keeping a
lot of this hardware is that they're
actually going to melt it down for the
rare metals inside and especially with
the older parts in the older generations
of used PC parts there was a lot more of
these rare metals used before the prices
hiked on exchanges now another thing
going on here is this kingston memory if
you guys remember when they advertised
this stuff at least back when this stuff
was available
it had lifetime warranties so a lot of
people will come just places like this
and not have to worry about the memory
being faulty because since it does carry
a lifetime warranty they can go get it
replaced especially in a place like
Taiwan where Kingston has a service
center in the main electronics hub so
now we've picked out a heap of parts
that we're curious about we're going to
try and barter with them and see what
prices we can come up with and what we
have in total is for hard drives for
motherboards
and we don't know exactly what CPUs
these will have inside but regardless of
what CPU is inside if the price is right
then the price is right so we ended up
just getting out of that scrapyard and
it ended up being pretty good now here's
where things are gonna take a little
turn in a different direction I guess I
did notice the body language between
Marko who's my translator for this video
and the guy who owned the store at least
the shift worker who was in charge of
that scrapyard and I noticed his body
language was I guess he didn't really
want to deal with outsiders people who
weren't regular customers perhaps and I
have seen this in the past over ten
years ago when I dealt with car parts in
Japan I found a very big scrapyard for
where that scrapping car parts and I was
getting some really good deals
time after time but then they changed
management and all the sudden I didn't
get access to any deals anymore so it's
always an important thing that the
individual or in this case the seller
just naturally likes you and wants to
deal with you and strike a good bargain
so what exactly happened with the parcel
we got here well it ended up being a
little bit back and forth where we
didn't strike a deal initially and I
ended up walking because they wanted
about 1,500 NTD for the four sets of
motherboards and the four CPUs and a
little bit of memory and some hard
drives but for those CPUs in those
motherboards were potato CPUs no one
really wants them in a used gaming PC
everyone either wants an i-5 or an i7 so
they all had AI threes or Pentiums so
that was pretty much useless the stock
coolers they weren't really worth it so
that 1500 MTD which in u.s. dollar terms
would be about 50 US dollars wasn't that
good of a deal considering we don't know
at all if these parts work and since
we're after the motherboards that's
usually in a used PC that's trash
like this is probably going to be the
most common problem or most problematic
part that isn't going to work
so I'd like to think of it as almost a
50% gamble that these motherboards
actually won't work at all and since we
just came from a place where we're
getting 500 MTD and 400 NTD for a
motherboard I guess about 350 anti-d
aboard that we don't know works isn't
really worth it
especially since I do have to then lug
those boards back to Australia so what I
decided to do was come back with an
offer of hey you can take the CPUs out
since I know they have the most rare
metals in them compared to any other
part and you can also take the memory
since they're only 2 gigabyte sticks and
they're not really worth that much at
all and the coolers and we'll just take
the motherboards for 900 NTD for 4
motherboards he then thought about it
and he thought about it for a long time
and then he said sure so he ended up
giving us 900 NTD for for untested
motherboards so it was a pretty good
deal but of course I've still got to
test them and I will report back in the
description and the comments on whether
these boards or which ones end up
working in which ones don't
now another thing that I noticed with
this place was they didn't know the
prices of parts all too well so when I
asked him afterwards how much they would
take for the hard drives he said a
hundred NTD or about three US dollars
for each hard drive and of course having
all varying sizes you want to get the
one that's the biggest size when it
comes to computer parts so I ended up
getting a one terabyte hard drive for
three dollars and I had a lot of fun
doing this it was a new experience I
hope you guys enjoyed the journey we did
do a lot of traveling and it's funny the
further you go out of the city the more
you're going to find places like we
found today where you can get some
really good deals deals that Trump that
of the internet deals that Trump that of
some of the places in the city and the
places like for instance the first place
we went to they didn't even ask more
initially they just said look you can
have these boards for 500 NTD which was
cheaper than some of the other parts
that we got in the used parts hunt
vlogged so out of the city you don't
even need to hustle and you'll get
really good prices of course I didn't
really want to try my luck because I
thought they were already doing me a
really good deal and there were
see those parts out right in front of me
but ultimately when it comes to getting
deals it's always looking for the things
that other people aren't doing and going
to a scrapyard or in this case the
source of where all these used parts
come from in my opinion or at least the
real good deals come from that's
definitely gonna be an avenue if you
want to build a cheap gaming PC for even
cheaper then I could build a fourth and
lastly a big thanks to Marco who's a
friend of mine who speaks Chinese and he
found all these places for us and it was
quite a difficult task so make sure you
guys show him some love yet again in the
comments because this content otherwise
wouldn't be happening without him and
without aside I'll
so I just tested out all four of these
motherboards and all four of them worked
absolutely fine so that is shockingly
good value for money in the case of
hitting up the recycling center
the hard drive as well we're gonna talk
about that first because that's the most
scarier of the five parts that I got
from the recycling center and what was
so scary about it was that the
particular person who dumped it or
company they left all the data on board
this disk drive and I've always said in
the past and I think a lot of you guys
already know that you should always
erase all the data on a drive before you
sell it or get rid of it
and in this case this had like all
information on business-to-business
Trading's of like AMD Nvidia graphics
cards and stuff like that and some of it
was quite scary because you could see
minimum order quantity prices you could
see sample prices and it's just stuff
that should not be getting to the public
eye and in the case of me it's right up
my alley with enthusiast tech and saying
with you guys
we all understand this enthusiast Tech
and what it means and so it's just
ironic that a person in enthusiast tech
who found this drive it's got all
information loaded with this stuff on it
would have been a little bit funny if it
was loaded up with like I don't know
maybe cat cages or something and some
other completely different business but
this is right down our alley in so I was
really shocked to see all this
information still on the drive so yeah
definitely want to delete all this
private information next time guys
before you get rid of a drive but of
course the good news one terabyte hard
drive for $3 us I think it's really good
price I got it for a hundred new Taiwan
dollars which is just a ridiculously
good price for a one terabyte hard drive
of this caliber the other 1 terabyte
hard drive I got in the parts hunt as
well that works absolutely fine I did
come back and I have tested that but now
on to the motherboards where we got 3h
55 ms and these all worked absolutely
fine
they all worked in little bit different
ways where one of them had a dead CMOS
battery the other had a load operating
system flashing then the other one
looked like it just was waiting for the
operating system but regardless all
these three boards from the gigabytes
things will work absolutely fine because
I've seen all these boot screens before
so that was a really good deal we got on
those three boards the as rock board
itself was a little bit bizarre in that
when I first initially booted it I had a
memory stick in a one and it wouldn't
boot then I changed over to be one and
it booted fine and then once I had two
sticks in it would boot as well so that
was a little bit bizarre maybe they
didn't spend a whole lot of time writing
the BIOS on this particular board and B
one should have been a one and that's
why it wouldn't boot off a one initially
if that makes any sense but never seen a
h7t one before and it's quite surprising
to see a skew like this actually existed
and the form factor is definitely a
little bit weird but regardless it does
work fine and that's the main thing and
it will hopefully power up a gaming
system coming to your sub box as soon
but I think the biggest thing to come
out of today's video is the fact that
recycling centers at least in the Taiwan
and in Asia can be an absolute goldmine
for picking up used parts and in the
cases of a lot of these businesses they
just don't have time to sell these
things to the public so they dump them
and a lot of the times they just load it
up with new parts now I'm pretty sure
part of that dumping is probably like Oh
make sure this data is all erased and it
doesn't get to the public so maybe I was
a one-off I'm not too sure if you guys
have heard of any stories or any
experiences like this and be sure to let
us know in the comment section below but
this was just a crazy experience where I
got the best deals of the best deals in
Taiwan from the scrap yards and going in
there and hustling as well as getting
four legit Windows licenses to go along
with all these four motherboards I think
that's one of the best things to come
out of it and the boards themselves only
costed me like under 10 US dollars a pop
so really good value for money of course
they did want a bit more money for all
these CPUs in memory if they came with
that but in terms of the CPUs the
coolers in the memory I decided to pass
on that because they did want a bit of
money for them and they were really bad
CPUs by i35 50s stuff that you could not
use in gaming PCs and get realistically
good value for flipping when you can add
like a next 3440 and then that costs
about nine dollars and you can then re
flip that and make much more money than
you would with an i3 550 that makes any
sense but ultimately scavenging through
a junkyard and getting PC parts was a
massive success I thought one of these
boards would have been faulty or one of
these parts would have been faulty but
they weren't and I guess something to
look out for would be make sure the
parts look good on the surface because
if they got rust on them or if they look
like they've been sitting outside in the
rain I would have passed on them these
sort of were like looking like that
fresh parts that had came in that day
possibly even in the morning and pretty
much I just went to town on them and got
all the good stuff out and even though I
didn't have enough time and in my
suitcase was really limited because I
already picked up a heap of used parts
before that I would have loved to have
gone back there and sort of cleaned the
whole place out the next day but yeah in
terms of my suitcase and how I pack
things if you guys want to see a
separate video on that then I can
definitely do that but essentially how
it works was I used all the clothes that
are dirty and wrapped the parts in for
cushioning so that way I get my clothes
in the suitcase I get the parts in the
suitcase and as you can see in this vlog
they all come back
absolutely fine there's no damage to
them so really good experience in terms
of hustling getting the best deals but
at the same time it's also a lot of fun
so if you guys want to go out of the
city especially in Taiwan and do the
same thing then also be prepared to not
only budget a lot of time because it did
take me an hour and a half to get out
there but also have someone who speaks
the local lingo I can't stress how
important this is if I didn't have
someone like Marco who spoke Chinese I
wouldn't have been able to communicate
at all or do any sort of bargaining it
would have been impossible because they
didn't even speak like any basic words
of English and I wouldn't expect them to
it is their country that's their
language but in the case of Thailand for
example when I went bargain hunting by
myself there was always someone close by
that the person didn't speak English
that would be able to translate or speak
a bit of English and you'd be able to
negotiate and come to an agreement and
you guys that's it for the junkyard
scavenge if
you guys enjoyed this one then be sure
to hit that like button also let us know
in the comment section below obviously a
favorite deal in today's pic and also if
you saw anything that you thought was
cool in the background or anything like
that let us know in the comments but I
know you guys love this use price
performance stuff and these boards and
this hard drive it's definitely going to
be part of an upcoming build coming to
your sub box I don't know when as I've
got a lot going on but it's definitely
gonna be hitting hard the price
performance and I'm probably gonna have
to order a few Zeon's off Aliexpress to
accommodate these boards but with that
aside I'll catch you in a nother tech
video very soon if you enjoy this one be
sure to slap that like button and I'll
see you next time peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
