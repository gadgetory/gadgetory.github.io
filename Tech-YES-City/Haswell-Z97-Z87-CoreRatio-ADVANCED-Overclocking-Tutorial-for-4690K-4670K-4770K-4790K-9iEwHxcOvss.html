coming back to you guys today finally
with the intermediate / advanced
overclocking tutorial 4 has well now
this guide is going to be assuming that
you already have some knowledge of
overclocking because there's going to be
things that I'm going to do in this
overclock tutorial that if you don't
know anything about overclocking is not
going to make sense so explain all the
basic things but I'm going to explain
the more advanced things now this
overclocking j'adore is something that I
kind of stumbled on upon when I was
doing my 5 gig overclock and basically
let's get into it anyway so you need
three programs cpu-z prime95 real temp
and you guys know you can use whichever
ones you want if you want to use burn
test or if you want to use OC CT
anything you want to use that's fine
restart your computer and jump straight
into BIOS now I have been playing around
with this because it is tricky and I'm
going to explain it on different
motherboards there will be different
ways to do this this is for the MSI
motherboard more specifically but
basically everything I'm explaining here
can be done in the tutorial so basically
here guys I haven't actually found my
sweet spot and I'm going to find it
while I'm doing this video for you which
is actually going to be awesome as you
can see that I go through all the
frustrating things now the important
thing is to leave if you're on the MSI
g45 which are not for you you guys are
you're going to leave your CPU ratio on
auto that's right you're gonna leave it
on auto but you have to turn make sure
that enhanced turbo is enabled so this
is important don't leave this on auto
make sure this is on enabled now for
your ring buzz ring ratio I suggest
leaving it at this sweet spot my I've
already found my ring ratio sweet spot
and that's a 4.1 gig I like leaving it
there generally for all my overclocked
even if I'm going up to 4.6 which is my
general daily overclock before I'm doing
this tutorial now basically what I'm
going to do is as you guys know my 4.6
gig overclocked is my sweet spot
overclocked for my CPU and this is done
at one point two five volt and I
generally give it a little bit more
juice on the offset so I do a plus
offset with point zero zero five just to
make sure it's completely stable if I
leave this on this I did get
occasionally I did you know maybe once
in five days I got a blue screen so that
little bit extra just made a 24 so
stable for me now what I'm going to do
today is I'm going to be trying to
extract the most out of my 4.6 good
overclock so this is a thing called CPU
core ratio and basically this will be in
different parts of the BIOS so as you
can see here I was testing it with
different settings so I was testing it
with four gig and just to make sure that
it worked so the important thing is I'll
go over that one more time quickly for
you guys is that you want to make sure
that your enhancer adjust CPU ratios on
auto and then you want to make sure
enhanced turbo is enabled as well so
that's the two things in order to get
this to work you have to do CPU PCI
power PLL I suggest booting that off the
Southbridge I noticed it made my
overclock fully stable as well that's
something I recommend as well feel free
to copy any of these settings in my boss
if you wish to but let's get on straight
away now to the main juice of it's so
active processor processor cores that
what you want to do is you want to
change this to one because this is I
know you bring in what the hell but this
is directly related to how this works
basically you're going to find out which
core on your CPU is the weakest link and
unfortunately if it's core number one
then this tutorial is not going to work
pretty much at all but there's a 75%
chance that you're going to be able to
get something extra out of your CPU as
opposed to what you have now there's a
lot of people saying look I've got four
point to Google one point two five volt
and so this tutorial for you guys you to
be able to find out if your core can go
up if your core can go up to four point
eight for example so that's what we're
going to do first off is we're going to
set this at one core active processor
cores I've only got one core and it's
going to go all the way up to four point
eight gigahertz we're not going to worry
about these two for now because I know
that they run a 4.6 I know the other
cause all run at four point six so I'm
going to try and get four point eight
out of my first core and then I'm going
to find out which core doesn't like to
be run at four point eight gigs if that
makes any sense so I've got one
processor core active so there's only
going to be booting on one core and now
if it can boot at one if you can boot at
four point eight gigs on one core then I
know core number one is a pretty damn
good core
I can boot 4.8 gigs at one point to 5
volt what I'm going to be testing though
is if it can boot on two cores at 4.8
gigs then i know'd core number two is
really good as well and then I
eventually go down to three cores four
cores and I find out which core cannot
run basically which core can't run at
four point eight gigs and hopefully it's
call number four that way I'll be able
to get when only three as you can see
here we've got four point eight gigs and
we're only at one point two five volt so
now we'll just run a quick benchmark and
I'm going to be very quick because this
is a tutorial and I want to get onto the
that's sort of the teaching side of
things but basically core number one as
we can see here core one can run a four
point eight gigs at one point two five
volt one point two five five so it's a
really good core number one on my CPU is
really good as you guys know with my
five gig overclock but one thing I did
learn about the five you go clock and
I'll talk about at the end was that that
5p go like I did on air was technically
five gig on all caused because of the
fact that I did the dynamic ratio I
dialed that in manually anyway let's get
on now to so we got four point eight gig
one call and it's working okay so that's
really cool so what we're going to do
now is we're going to restart the
computer and I now know that you know I
mean I'm assuming that I've tested this
for a lot longer on the stability test
but I now know that I mean quote with
the rabbit fingers this now runs on one
core one point two five five volt so I
know some of this is you know some of
you guys know I won't and it's slow down
and explain it a bit more but I'm again
I'm assuming you guys are sort of cat
keeping up with me here so now we're
going to go to the second chord we're
going to find out if two chords can run
at four point eight now so basically I
want to resize you see here BIOS is said
look there's only one chord gone so
where are they going to say you've got
one Corbitt basically you've got to
restart again and you're going to enter
BIOS again because you're going to say
look I want to cause now and I want to
see if two cores can run at four point
eight gig so I haven't tested this as
well and like this is you guys know me
I've always always give you guys honest
opinions I'm gonna be basically this
guide might take 40 minutes I don't know
but I'm going to basically nail down my
sweet spot overclock you
using the core ratios now it's not
basically this doesn't work basically
what this means I'm going to go a little
bit more into explanation here it's
basically what this core rate show means
is it's not basically one core one isn't
running at four point eight gigs and
quarters running at four point seven
it's basically when two one cause in use
it will go up to four point eight when
two cores are in use it'll go up to if
you set it in here four point seven the
first two cores will go up to four point
seven so if you're running all threads
if you're running for cause it'll only
go up to what you set the four core
ratio are if that makes any sense but
it's in it's in effect it is a good
thing if you can cascade it down into
basically so I'm going to dial in four
point out there anyway so we're going to
keep going a bit it's a good thing if
you cascade it down and you find out
which core is the weakest so anyway I
mean I'll get onto the explanation a bit
later but basically you just want to
find out which core is the weak core at
one point two five volt so for me as you
guys can see core one is a beautiful
core it loves running at four point
eight at one point two five let's see if
core number two is the same story
okay so we're opening up CPU Z now and
we go four point eight so there it is
four point eight seems to be working as
well so it's doing the stress test and
we've got two workers there and it's
working I mean it's actually working I
mean I on it now okay there we go
blue screen of death so what I'm going
to do now is I'm going to dial this down
to four point seven I now know core two
is not as good as core one and I'm glad
you guys saw that because I now know
that core two is not as good as core one
and I'm going to dial that down to four
point seven and so I found my little
weak core now so here's not as good as
cool basically called twos like no man I
can't do this I can't run at four point
eight gigs and so I'm going to drop him
down to four point seven and see if he
can run at four point seven I've kind of
got a feeling that core to maybe my bad
core I haven't actually tested this out
for you guys as you know
here to make sure you set your hard
drive another thing to make sure you
don't have all those caching options
enabled as well make sure if you do this
you make sure that yeah your data can't
be corrupted as always I did recommend
that in the beginners guide that's the
first thing I recommend but I sure I've
already done it so it goes without
saying let's move in now cpu-z four
point seven okay two cores are running
up to four point seven gig so basically
those again I'm saying with this call
ratio thing now that two cores are in
use it'll drop down to four point seven
on the two cores so you can see here
that's running a four point seven
ok I'm going to assume that this is OK I
mean I obviously I want to test this a
lot longer but since I'm doing the
tutorial for you guys it seems to be ok
at four point seven it's saying look ok
we're all good here we can run I mean
you can check for temps too but I know
for a fact that my temps aren't a
problem at these at these settings we'll
get will have a look here so we've got
two cores here I mean yeah the damn in
temperatures are probably about twenty
degrees in here I've got my heater going
at the moment and we can see the
temperatures are only 51 and 54 so again
get that cooler boy toys liquid Pro outs
really good stuff let's move on now
we're going to restart our computer and
we're going to do three cores now so
we're going to move on to three coolers
so we know that two cores at four point
seven seems to be ok I mean let's just
pretend that I did stress test this for
four hours or so we're going to be fast
tracking it for you guys so there's two
cores at four point seven gig now let's
move on now to three cores and yeah I'm
going to discover while I'm doing the
cheater I'm going to discover how good
my CPU really is so again we'll go to
three cores now save an exit and we're
going to see if three cores can run at
four point seven so we can't go any
higher if you go higher on the three
core ratio limit what happens is in the
MSI bias I don't know about the Zeus
boss but in the amount MSI bias it'll
basically revert to the to court ratio
it'll say hey look to cause
in use anyway and since that's lower
than the three core so to basically if I
do this it'll basically void all the
core ratios and I believe it actually
resets back to order from what I quickly
tested before so now we're going to try
this at four point seven now and four
point seven and we're going to see if it
boots and if it runs as smooth as it did
the last time and you know as you guys
know it's just extracting that little
bit extra out of your computer so you're
just getting that little bit extra of
performance and it's always a good thing
right free performance hell yeah and so
it is it is one thing I like about house
well I honestly I would like to see them
implement an individual core clock where
you could set the core clock on each
individual processor manually that'd be
really cool
that's something I look forward to in
the future if they did that but this is
you know it's definitely a way to get a
little bit of extra performance so it
does seem to be working now four point
seven gig on three calls so it's saying
look Brian for you know this is my
computer's my little CPU saying look we
are working really easily I've been
doing this fun 55 degrees not a problem
when getting my burning up a bit more
power and a bit more heat and yeah so
it's working I mean three cores is fine
you see here the stress test is working
I mean this is real rough again like I
said I'll be rendering videos playing
games for honest for real stability
testing but this is just fast tracking
so we've got four point eight four point
seven on to call ratio four point seven
on the three Correggio let's now try
four four point seven on the four core
ratio and I believe this may this may
crash on the four point seven so I may
have to drop this down to four point six
on the four core ratio but then let's
find out anyway so we've got this going
it seems to be pretty sweet yeah okay
that it's worth it for the better part
it's working so we're going to restart
our computer and we're just going to say
look for point seven
No what the hell just happened there
okay something happened there I think it
just crashed out so four-point-seven is
a no-go Wow okay wait to sleep alright
wait for point seven is a did I I'm
accidentally hit sleep anyway you saw
that noob mistake so let's continue on
so it actually does work a 4.7 so we're
going to drive four point seven on the
last clock but since I already know that
my computer can't do four point seven on
all four cores at this level I'm going
to say that core four is basically core
four can only run it for point six so
I'm going to do four point eight four
point seven four point seven four point
six and then I've found the sweet spot
for my CPU so that's that's that guys
that's basically the tutorial for you
guys to extract the maximum out of yeah
megahertz out of your CPU so here we go
here four point eight 4.7 4.7 four point
six and so there's pretty much my sweet
spot for my CPU I may just try four
point nine just because I don't know
actually I really don't know how good
core one really is core one could be an
absolute beast I'm not too sure of that
so what I want to do is actually I'm
going to find out if call one is a beast
finally I mean so if you guys want to
see this live and all sort of I'll talk
while I'm doing this so since I found
basically this is the end of the
tutorial here I found my sweet spot here
and this basically is it here I mean
four point eight 4.7 4.7 four point six
and I'm going to go at the end of this
no do it now I'll explain a little bit
more basically when one cause in use so
I've got core one two three four and
when only one core is in use which will
be call one it'll go up to four point
eight gigs so from running a one
threaded application
all the way up to four points four point
eight gigs now if I'm required to run a
two threaded application it'll go up to
four point seven gigs and now if I'm
required to run a 3-quart or three
threaded application we'll go up to four
point seven gigs and then if I require
to use all cores that will go up to only
four point six gigs and it'll do it in
the order of using the cores based on
their number basically call one tool to
call three core four in that order so
call one will get used the most out of
anything so that's how it usually works
anyway let's just test this and then I
will just do a four point nine on the
one core just to see if it works and of
course I just do want to quickly do a
stability test on this to make sure that
this works and that's basically the
tutorial guys so if you have any
questions please leave a comment the
comment section below
I'll also be submitting this to Tom's
for a tutorial they asked me to submit a
tutorial form and they're really nice
the guy the guys name's Joe fish guy
he's a really nice guy messaged me and
he said look you know please submit a
tutorial and I did so this is the
tutorial I'm submitting I would submit a
few more if I had the time I just really
don't have time on my hands at the
moment so as you see here that the
overclocks actually running fine it's
since 4.6 gigs now on all cause it's
running sweet and that's a good
overclock so I mean I've extracted an
extra technically I've extracted an
extra two hundred megahertz out of my
CPU for what it's worth I've got an
extra two hundred megahertz when it's on
one core I've got an extra hundred
megahertz when it's on two or three Fred
threats which is awesome so now I'm just
going to talk lastly so yeah if you
haven't go if you haven't already guys
please hit the like button as well I'm
just you know I'm dedicating my time to
doing this tutorial for you but if you
have any questions please send me a PM
if it's urgent as well I want to talk
about this a bit more and I want you
guys to generally show me what your
capabilities capable of because a lot of
guys are telling me again they're
getting 4.2 gig 'its and they can only
do that at one point to 5 volt they're
saying that their CPUs at dog
overclockers this may enable you to get
a little bit more out of say core 1 &amp;amp; 2
if they're if they're really good cause
as you can see with my core it's really
good core 1 going up
4.8 gig if cool one and two on your CPUs
are really good then you may be able to
get four point six out of them four
point seven and if core four is a dog
then that might be the one that's
holding back all your other cause so
basically this core ratio will say look
all right when all four cores are needed
we'll drop it down to four point two but
in the meantime if there's only a three
threaded or two threaded application or
one threaded application we can gain
some extra speed so let's use here this
is my sweet spot overclock this is going
to be my new overclock that I'm going to
use from here on so it's that's how it
is I've taught myself something and I've
taught you guys something as well so you
guys have already you can hit that sub
button subscribe to tech s city and I'll
be coming back in the new year with some
more tutorials and stuff like that so if
you have any tutorials that you really
want please a please submit it in the
comments or send me a PM I will be
getting an AMD FX 8350 70 K I want to
put them head-to-head and I want to see
how good this cpu really is I mean
there's I'm just hearing so many
conflicting reports I just hear so much
everything you know one says one says
the 4670 k's a lot better people say are
the 8350 s just as good i want to grab
this FX 8320 and grab it in my hands and
test it against this for 670 k because
i've used a lot of CPUs in my time
except i haven't actually got to gotten
a hold of the FX 8350 or a FX 8320 i
would like to test it in the flesh but
anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this CPU
tutorial if you did yeah I'm going to
sorry I'm like sound like a broken
record but yeah just sub to take a city
and then I'm going to catch you guys
soon and I hope you enjoyed this
tutorial took me a little bit of you
know I'm just doing the stress test
making sure it all runs good if you guys
also want to know I will put the I'll
put the D lid I'm going to make a full D
lid tutorial next year when I get some
time but basically in the mid dump I do
recommend deleting your CPU as you can
see here my CPU 20 degrees ambience
roughly and I mean it's not even
clocking 60 degrees at you know full
load this is prime 95 this is something
that stresses the hell out of your CPU
you see here my maximum temps are
beautiful so anyway guys I hope you
enjoyed this tutorial and yeah if I've
enjoyed it as well because I've
basically discovered better overclock
for myself as well
it has peace out for now Maran easy wait</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
