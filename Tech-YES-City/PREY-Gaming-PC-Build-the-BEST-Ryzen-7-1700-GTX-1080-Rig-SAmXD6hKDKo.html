pcs with rising CPUs in them in this
first PC I have here is the 8 core 16
threaded Rison 7 1700 build we're using
a GTX 1080 and the performance is
amazing
welcome back to tech city this is the
yes-man Brian continue guys today with
the first of many rising builds now
razzin is hit hard when it was released
with price-performance and the updates
that have been spiraling through have
only kept increasing the performance to
the point where it's a really good
recommendation not just for
single-player games but now for
multiplayer games too and you'll find
out today when I do some of those
benchmarks but as with all the PCs that
get built around here we'll start off
with the build then we'll do the
benchmarks for today's popplers we're
going with the risin 7 1700 which is an
8 core 16 threaded CPU from AMD
it's overclockable and it offers some of
the best price performance out there in
the CPU market today and then on the
graphics card we have the GTX 1080 from
Strix which is really cool it's really
quiet in an overclocked extremely well
and then to overclock all this we need
to be six-fifty from Coolermaster gold
rated power supply huge amount of amps
on the 12 volt line and then we're
putting all that in a cooler master 5 T
Pro which is a really premium case that
features tempered glass and then the
cooler CPU we're using the 240
millimeter pro version of cooler masters
latest CPU coolers and then on the
storage we have a 2 terabyte sshd from
Seagate which carries a five-year
warranty and is a really good budget
option if you want a lot of storage and
you still want to keep things sped up as
for the motherboard we are using the x3
70 Carbon gaming Pro from MSI which is a
very solid price performer in the lineup
of x3 70 motherboards and then lastly on
the memory we have 16 gigabytes of ddr4
from Gil the Evo X this is RGB memory
that also has two profiles of overclocks
in there one being 29 33 megahertz and
the other being 3200 now this brings the
whole total of this build to 16 hundred
and eighty-seven US dollars or if you're
in Australia brings it to two thousand
three hundred and eighty-five Australian
dollars
then I'm going to do quickly talk about
overclock the GPU the GTX 1080 I put in
here this managed to go over 2.1
gigahertz stable and it did so with very
low temperatures the cpu in this case it
only managed to hit three point eight
five gigahertz on all cords it sells a
little bit disappointed with considering
on another configuration with this exact
same cpu I managed to get this CPU up to
four gigahertz stable so I'm not
entirely sure what's going on here with
this setup so with that said let's run
the benchmark
so there it is the PC is complete and it
was running every single game I threw it
at 1440p with exceptional frame rates
even that latest title prey managed to
get around about 140 FPS now I asked you
guys on Twitter which games you wanted
me to benchmark prey was one of those
but also people requested Rainbow six
siege so I threw that in there and did
the in-house benchmark and again a 1440p
ultra this PC managed to pull off around
140 frames so if you are at 1440p and
you do have a high refresh rate monitor
like some of those high-end 144 hertz
IPS panels then you can get some really
good frame rates out of a setup pretty
much identical to this the GT x 1080
that thing is still a beast even of the
1080p eyes out genichi is really an
overkill graphics card in a lot of cases
and this build just shows that the 1080
even when it's overclocked it just gives
you guys exceptional frame rates and
coupled with that r7 1700 when you
overclock that the frame rates are also
very high although the goodness doesn't
just stop there with this bill one thing
that really blew me away was the
performance now in dota 2 so when I went
to the AMD conference in Sydney they
were telling me that they were working
with the game developers to optimize
their multiplayer titles two of those
being csgo and dota 2 and I must say
when I tested both these games the frame
rates were exceptionally high dota 2
even at 1440p which I should have been
probably testing at lower settings it
was still managing to score now in the
200 FPS Markum i know when i tested this
a couple of months ago it was getting
around lo 100 souls really surprised and
really happy to see that the rising CPUs
are also getting optimizations for
multiplayer games and this is also
another reason why I've held back part
three of my comparison with the 7700 K
versus the r7 1700 versus the jewels
Xeon because I wanted to let the updates
flow through not just with the hardware
but also with the games to let rise and
perform at its absolute best before I
made a solid recommendation on those
CPUs also some things that I wanted to
touch on before I get out of here some
of those build samples that were sent
over for this build
the MSI X 370 carbon is a pretty solid
motherboard it's not as
some of the more expensive options out
there but if you're looking to get on
the horizon on an ex 370 board then it
certainly does look really good and it
performs pretty decent if you're on a
budget also Coolermaster did send out
their 240 millimeter per cooler that did
a pretty good job I didn't see
temperatures rise over around about 77
degrees that was the max with this
overclock at around 1.4 volts and also
their cool the master v6 50 power supply
did do a pretty good job of providing
all these parts of power nothing really
shut off or anything didn't really get
close to getting near the limit of this
power supply as you can see there with
the power consumption in a fire strike
combined benchmark and also the last
part that they sent out was the cooler
master 5 T Pro this is a really
exceptional case albeit it is very
expensive too it's going to be usually
double what you would expect to pay for
a case however on that note it does have
tempered glass it does come with 3 140
millimeter fans and it just honestly has
a really good premium feel to everything
I didn't have one problem building in
this case and the final look is
absolutely gorgeous
anyway guys if you enjoyed today's video
to be sure to hit that like button and
let me know in the comments section
below what would you do differently if
you had a similar budget and also on
that note I will be putting an extra
list in the description below to some
people who want to get similar parts but
don't have as much money as today build
I'll be putting in some cheaper pipes in
there where you can save on things but
still get that r7 1700 and also still
get that GTS 1080 so I look forward to
your comments as always and I'll catch
you guys in another tech video very soon
peace out for now - bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
