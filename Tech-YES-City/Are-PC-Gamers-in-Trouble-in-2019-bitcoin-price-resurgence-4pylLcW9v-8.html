its way back into the news
with a recent price
surge from Bitcoin itself
and then that sort of flowed
on to all those other alt coins
but as a gamer should you be worried
about those cryptocurrency
miners buying up
all your graphics cards
like we saw in 2017.
Well, we're gonna answer those questions
and talk about the market in
general with cryptocurrency
as I haven't delved into
it for quite some time.
But let's lay out those facts
for all the yes men and women out there.
And this right here is actually
a very old graphics card,
it has nothing to do with
cryptocurrency mining
and in fact if you were
to mine on a GTX 650,
you'd probably be losing money.
(rock music)
So cryptocurrency mining,
it first made an appearance
using gaming grade hardware
back in 2012 and 2013
with AMD Radeon cards mining for Bitcoin.
After that came a big demand
for a thing called an ASIC miner
which is an application-specific
integrated circuit
which was dedicated to doing one thing
and that's mining the Bitcoin algorithm.
So with that it was much more efficient
at mining this cryptocurrency
than gaming graphics cards
ever were and ever could be.
However after this break,
cryptocurrency then saw it
as penetrating the world market
and this is where we saw a severe shortage
in gaming graphics cards in the market
to the point where MSRPs
were being affected
on new graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD
and that's when there
was a popular resurgence
in used hardware for people
looking to get into PC gaming.
Now in relation to the
last boom we saw in 2017,
this was related to alt coins.
In other words, cryptocurrencies
that weren't Bitcoin
and they were in demand.
Popular cryptocurrencies
like Ethereum and then Z cash
and ZenCash really made a
demand for these graphics cards
and their mining
capabilities and with that,
I think a lot of gamers
saw it as a safe bet,
myself included because if
cryptocurrency went bust,
you then had a fallback
where you could sell
your hardware to gamers.
If we look at the other side of the fence
in relation to ASIC miners,
once they're redundant,
they're pretty much useless.
That hardware is as good as useless.
It can't do any gaming,
can't do really anything
besides collect dust.
Now here's where things start to split off
in two different directions
and why I don't think
you have to worry in 2019
if you're a gamer looking
to upgrade your system
or get into PC gaming
and the first being is that
the actual profitability
of using a gaming graphics
card to mine cryptocurrencies
is so little and it's actually reliant
on how much it costs you to
use electricity in your area.
For instance, if we go on watttomine.com,
and look at an RX 570 which
can be had for very cheap
at the moment on the used market.
Those cards, if you were paying
10 cents a kilowatt-hour USD
would give you 20 cents
per day profitability
which basically isn't even
worth your time and hassle
considering that's a 24-hour
calculation every day, all day
and so after that timeframe of
you getting your money back,
your graphics card is probably
going to run into problems
before it even completes this cycle
of getting your money back.
If we look at new cards like
our RTX 2070s, RTX 2080 TIs,
they pretty much fall
into the same category
where a cryptocurrency
called Ravencoin is coming up
with giving you around 60
cents plus on an RTX 2070
than on a 2080 TI you can get up
to over one dollar per day
which would take it over three years
for you to get your investment back
considering you didn't
run into any problems
in the mean time.
So we can see from this,
this is it's pretty much not profitable
to use a gaming graphics
card to mine cryptocurrency
and that's considering you
can get power that cheap.
Where I live in Australia,
it's about 20 cents per kilowatt-hour USD
so I'd actually be losing money
if I was mining cryptocurrencies
on gaming graphics cards.
Now I don't think there's going
to be a whole lot of demand
for gaming great graphics cards in 2019
for cryptocurrency mining and that's
because a lot of the alt
coins that were competing
with Bitcoin have now cemented themselves
and they too are using ASIC miners.
So there's really no demand
for gaming graphics cards
when it comes to cryptocurrencies
and then even off that branch,
if we get new cryptocurrencies,
are people going to trust
them and what do they have
to offer of the already flooded market
of alt coins that already exists.
So basically I feel like
there's a dwindling demand
for new cryptocurrencies
that are alt coins
that have anything better
to offer than the plethora
of cryptocurrencies that
are already out there
on the market and then if
we look at correlations
between things like the Dow
Jones Industrial Average
for example having
pretty much a bull market
at the same time with
a cryptocurrency market
that is now plateauing off at a level
where I feel like we may
be entering a recession
in terms of stock markets
which I feel would be heavily correlated
to cryptocurrencies.
So there is a lot of
uncertainty out there in 2019
about the direction of
money markets themselves.
And then the last observation
I've made is relation
to ZenCash, a previous cryptocurrency
that I was interested in is
now sort of breaking lower
than Bitcoin's average.
In other words, there's pent-up
demand more so for Bitcoin,
the main cryptocurrency than there is
for other alt coins, at
least in this case ZenCash
with us breaking down and
away and lower in price
in comparison to Bitcoin than
it is to other alt coins.
So as I said in my previous
cryptocurrency videos,
trends are always your friend
and you should always crack on to them
and in this case, I
feel like Bitcoin itself
has made strides and since then,
I've noticed Bitcoin has
had a lot of upgrades.
They've improved the infrastructure a lot
and so I can definitely
see that cryptocurrency
remaining toppdogg for
quite some time yet.
So in a nutshell, if you are a PC gamer
and you're in the market
for a gaming graphics card,
I feel like in 2019, you
don't have a whole lot
to worry about like what we saw in 2017.
But there are some arguments
as to why cryptocurrency mining
on graphics cards could see a resurgence
and that is because people like using
their gaming graphics
card to support hashing
while they're not gaming and
that's always been an argument
to say, hey I can support
some kind of cause
while I'm not gaming and I
can utilize this hardware
to hash or make money but at
the moment as we said before,
it's really not profitable
to be doing that
on a gaming graphics card.
Then maybe the last
argument for the resurgence
of cryptocurrency mining
on gaming graphics cards
could be sentiment.
Over this in my opinion
is a bigger against
than it is a for.
Simply put, it I feel like
the market has changed
and that there's a lot of
actual negative sentiment
towards cryptocurrency rather than for it
especially in relation to alt coins
and mining on gaming grade hardware.
I know for a fact that a lot
of my friends who set out
to mine on gaming grade hardware
actually ended up losing money overall
but not only that ended
up losing their time
and so these are a lot of tech enthusiasts
who knew how to set up this
hardware and get into it
and if they're not making
money then their word of mouth
is gonna spread around and so
I do feel like going forward
and although sentiment
can change very quickly,
I feel like it's a very strong build up
against mining on gaming grade hardware.
So these are the main factors
when we revisit cryptocurrency in 2019.
Why I don't think we're
gonna see that big blow up
that we saw in 2017 and if anything,
we could just see a main
focus on what already exists.
Things like Ripple, Ethereum and Bitcoin
could be those main drivers
that have already proven
themselves in the market
and have real-world uses and
so they're going to continue
to go up and break away
from some of these alt coins
which will then continue to go down
and lose market sentiment
as well as value.
Anyway guys, that's about
it for today's video.
I hope you enjoyed this one.
If you did, be sure to
hit that like button.
Let us know though in
the comment section below
what do you think will
happen with cryptocurrency
and gaming graphics cards in 2019.
I think we're honestly at a safe level
and I think with other
economic conditions happening,
this year sort of leaves my
stomach a little bit uneasy
and so that's just my gut feeling.
I've learned to trust
this thing right here
and that's an awesome shirt
if you want to get that,
there's a link in the description below
for that tech, yes, love and merch
and with that said, love each
and every one of you guys
and with that said too, don't
believe everything you see
on the news in relation
to Bitcoin and price.
There's this article going on.
The trading volumes up four-fold,
but when you look at the trading volume
verse a few years ago,
it's down massively.
So users news, I don't
take it too seriously.
I just listen to instinct
as weird as that sounds
and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon.
Rejoice, your gaming
graphics cards are safe.
Peace out for now, bye.
