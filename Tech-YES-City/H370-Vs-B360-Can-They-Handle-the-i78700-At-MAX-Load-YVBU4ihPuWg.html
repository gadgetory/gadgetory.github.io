motherboards are now upon us in the wild
and are they what you're looking for
especially if you're looking to get a
non overclockable cpu whack it in even
use the stock cooler and extract more
value because previously the z3 70
motherboards were released and they were
the only motherboards on the shelves for
quite a while and people who just wanted
to get an eighty seven hundred for
example didn't need that Z license and
you may be wondering what are the
differences between these and of course
is e360 motherboards well the biggest
difference between this and of course
the z series is you can't overclock on
these motherboards and in fact on all
three motherboards the max memory
multiplier you can achieve is 20 666 but
here we've got a h3 70 and Wi-Fi from
gigabyte B 360 or is gaming 3 and also a
h3 70 MITx from asrock and you're
probably wondering can these
motherboards handle and 8700 K at 4.3
gigahertz which is essentially the same
as in 8700 without throttling on the vrm
and the answer that question is yes so
I've tested all these motherboards
with the FLIR one pro camera and we can
see that the gigabyte got around 85
degrees the h3 70 and this was after a
sizable stress test of over 15 minutes
in I 264 on all cores and all threads
and I was actually pleasantly surprised
to see that this motherboard was doing
so well we've got a little bit of
headroom there on the vrm they're using
a 4 + 2 phase power design with on
semiconductors 34 amps on the high side
and 52 amps on the low side this is at
80 degrees this is right where it's
getting stressed at now the ambient
temperatures were about 24 degrees when
I was doing the testing and moving along
with the B 360 motherboard here it's
using the same vrm at least for the CPU
except it has a 4 plus three-phase power
design and you've got again four phases
dedicated towards the CPU so no surprise
when I did the vrm temperature test on
this it scored basically the same since
they both have heat sinks and I was
getting around 85 degrees as well on
full load moving over to the h3 70 M
from asrock they're using a semi child
for the MOSFETs there the dual ends so
they packed it all into one box there
with the MOSFETs and you're getting a
MOSFET that's rated at 25 amps now when
I tested the 8700 K on this as well the
erm temperatures did go just above a
hundred degrees so it was a little bit
worried about what I'll sing but the
actual MOSFETs themselves were okay so
all three of these boards I was happy to
report that there was no throttling when
you're maxing out an 8700 K but of
course what about all the other bells
and whistles on these three motherboards
let's take a look
welcome back to check yet City this is
Brian coming to you guys today with a
look at these three multiples that you
see on the table now I did previously
take a look at the B 360 M the prime
series from Zeus I'll put the link up
here that was okay I mean within 8400
the vrm was getting a little bit hard
and I unfortunately couldn't even test
my 8700 K on that actual motherboard
I've got to figure that out I am gonna
go get another 8700 K retail sample and
go try that out on that motherboard to
see if it works but I was happy to say
that my engineering sample did work on
all these and they were juicing over a
hundred watts and the CPU alone so if
the vrm can handle it on the 8700 k then
it can handle it on any of the other
SKUs on the 8th gen coffee like CPUs now
the good thing is as well the audio on
all three of these motherboards is
actually pretty good I was surprised to
see that gigabyte have addressed and
also as rock as well that crosstalk
problem when we look at the asrock here
that's pretty much the same as it's
always been with the LC 1220 except this
time around there's that crosstalk it's
not leaking all the way up to a hundred
so cross talks really good frequency
response curve is really good as well
pretty much flat throughout the hallway
of course under 20 Hertz you do get a
little bit of a drop-off with that bass
but great for mid-range cans of course
if you're going for higher-end cans you
may wish to get a dedicated audio
solution the mic input itself was pretty
good the noise is pretty much on par
with all previous asrock motherboards so
you can use it with a decent mic and now
moving over to the B 360 mother body of
the gaming 3 they've also addressed that
crosstalk problem it's no longer
existent all the way up to 100 volume
however on this motherboard / - in
particular there was a 1.5 decibel
difference between the left and right
channel I couldn't balance that out
unless I manually set the right channel
at a bit of the less volume so I managed
to balance it out manually but out of
the box it was a little bit off the left
and right channel
crosstalk of course was really good
however when we're moving in the
frequency response curve that was a
little bit off as well at the higher
frequencies the bass roll-off was very
well controlled like 2.5 decibels on to
20 Hertz very nice will work pretty well
with mid-range cans and you
you have more volume on this as opposed
to the Z 370 which I previously took a
look at just last month and then moving
over now to the H 370 n here's where
things get interesting with the onboard
audio because the mic input showed
absolutely no noise all the way up to a
hundred with plus 30 dB
so I do believe they're using noise
suppression however with the audio it
was extremely loud I had to drop the
volume down to 25 just to get an
accurate reading on this motherboard
with the audio and the frequency
response curve did show some really
solid numbers the base drop-off was a
little bit more than these other two
boards but that's probably because I
lowered the volume that much that it may
have affected that base so the volume is
extremely loud on this motherboard the
mic input is really good too however
above a volume level of 95 there was
that crosstalk leaking problem that is
rearing its head again so if you are
using onboard audio with this and you do
have mid-range cans you may wish to set
the volume level to 95 or below and also
the mic import on the B 360 is pretty
much the same as the h3 70 from asrock
so pretty solid keep the volume at
either 50 with plus 20 DB or plus 30 DB
and you should be good to go with no
noise now the last thing with the audio
there is no coax optical out so if you
like me and you use a logitech Z 906
none of these motherboards are gonna
provide that so it was a little bit
disappointed to see that not being
present on all three boards but let's
look at the feature set on each of these
motherboards h3 70 and Wi-Fi of course
includes Wi-Fi tested the speeds on the
necks as well on all three boards they
all checked out all have consistent
speeds across Wi-Fi and the signal
strengths are really good
the asrock includes the antennas these
two here include a separate module
however the B 360 gaming you need a
plug-in device down in the middle of the
board so you do get that included with
the motherboard itself now with the USB
ports we've got five USB ports on the H
370 n also got a Type C as well and
you've got USB 3 though when I did test
the USB 3 speeds on some of the ports
they were only giving around USB 2
speeds so I'm not entirely sure what's
going on there
B 360 or is gaming was phenomenal and
saying with the Azeroth board these both
have
eight USB ports one of these being a
type see the asrock not having a type C
port both the Mini ITX boards
surprisingly have dual necks on board
too now the last thing is with
Thunderbolt support none of these
support Thunderbolt from the motherboard
directly though you can add in a card
and connect it up to the on board
connectors if you wish to the H 370 and
and the B 360 from gigabyte they include
RGB headers and so you can sync your RGB
with your motherboard via the BIOS or
the utility if you wish to be 360 has
four slots onboard here for up to 64
gigabytes of unbuffered memory these two
mini ITX ports have up to 32 gigabytes
support
there's also USB 3 headers on each of
the three motherboards and also if
you're going to be using outputs for
onboard video then the both the mini ITX
solutions have HDMI to out hdmi 1.4 and
DVI out the B 360 only has DVI and HDMI
1.4 out onboard and now the last thing
to talk about with the feature set
itself is the generous amount of fan
headers included on all three models
Mini ITX boards here they both have
three PWM fan header outs the B 360
gaming has five so that is impressive to
see if you want to use this in a full
fledge build then you know you're gonna
have a lot of fan header outs the B 360
also has to RGB outs and it also has the
ability to switch between 5 and 12 volt
control and now it's time to talk about
the last difference between all these
motherboards the B 360 versus the H 370
the chipset license itself the B 360 has
the Intel obtain rst driver control on
it the H 370 has the rst premium just
like the z3 70 and now with the z3 70
and the H 370 you can essentially raid0
nvme drives so even this little H 370 in
here from gigabyte you can get to nvm a
PCIe drives and then raid 0 since it
does actually have 2 m dot 2 slots one
on the front and one of the rear of the
board fantastic design the h3 70 from
asrock only has one so you won't be
doing any raid 0 and the B 360 although
it has 2 since you've got that license
with only the
not the premium you can't unfortunately
raid0 the drives on this motherboard so
now we're gonna move on to conclusion
time and of course the biggest thing
when you're buying any product is going
to be the price the H 370 n on Amazon at
the moment is a hundred and thirty US so
pretty well priced for a mini ITX board
that basically features everything that
I'd want out of a mini ITX board it's
even got that option to raid0 those nvme
drives the onboard audio is fantastic
it's also even got RGB control on board
though not too sure how you'd get too
much RGB bling on a mini ITX build in
Australia it's 215 AUD so the Australian
pricing is a little bit off I'd like to
see that fixed if possible move over to
the B 360 gaming 3 120 us or a hundred
and 80 Australian so it's actually
pretty well priced at least better price
than the H 370 N and of course you do
get actually the m2 shield as well I
forgot to mention this have tested this
before does actually make a difference
unlike other brands that are putting m
dot 2 shields on their boards this does
drop the temperatures of your m2 drive
does spread that heat out so it is great
if you're doing a lot of video editing
or doing massive file transfers and you
want to make sure that your nvme drives
gonna stay a bit cooler so overall
pretty solid unit as well as the V RMS
on both the gigabyte solutions max was
85 degrees on the worst case scenario as
well the bias itself as well was very
nice on these two solutions did have all
the options that you would want and was
very easy to configure out of the box
both on easy mode and advanced mode now
lastly we're moving on to the h3 7 TM
here from Ezra coming in at 115 US
dollars or if in Australia 170 AUD so
the Australian pricing is better in
comparison to the gigabyte boards and
also it's coming in $15 cheaper than the
gigabyte ITX solution the biggest
difference is is this has more USB ports
on the back you get eight standard USB
ports you don't have type C a native
connector on there but the gigabyte
you've only got four USB standard
connectors and of course that extra type
see the vrm did get a little bit hot I
did read up to 105 degrees but it still
did not throttle at all so will handle
an 8700 absolutely fine but
you do put it in a mini ITX built and if
you don't have air flow on that mini ITX
build then it could be a little bit of a
problem so just keep that in mind it was
a little bit hotter than the gigabyte
solutions here but ultimately it is
coming in cheaper and also if you want
to do what I did with the EM when
chopping with that hundred watt power
supply 8400 this would be the best bet
for you so really when it comes down to
it they've all got their feature sets
and they all are priced to where they
should be and yeah they all check out
guys so if you enjoyed this review then
be sure to hit that like button and let
me know in the comments section below
what do you think about the h3 semi and
B 360 motherboards also with a h3 10
motherboard I do want to take a look at
one of those so I'll see what I can do
and maybe pair with an 8100 though if
the VRMs are any weaker than these then
I probably wouldn't pair them with the
8700 the h3 tens are looking like
they'll handle an 8400 fine which is
where that budget price to performance
match up with the motherboard and the
CPUs is definitely going to sit for
sweet spot people who want to build
those gaming rigs out there anyway guys
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye
a little bit on semiconductors with the
high side rated at should research that
34 inch and you're getting well cut will
cost that out till the end
