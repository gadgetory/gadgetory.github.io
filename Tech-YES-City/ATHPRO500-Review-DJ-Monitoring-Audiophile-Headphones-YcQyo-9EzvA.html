he just coming back to you guys today
with a review of the audio technica ath
- per 500 headphones now the first thing
you will notice here is the box and
unlike other boxes guys this box is
actually very useful
I find unpacking the headphones was very
easy and actually found a little bonus
of this box is that you may want to keep
it as it is very easy to repack your
headphones and move them and store them
or whatever you want to do with them so
kudos to Audio Technica for making a
good box okay guys now moving on to the
headphones you can see that they are
fully adjustable a 90 degrees both to
the right and to the left which makes
them a full 180 degrees adjustable on
both earpieces they also tilt up and
down 90 degrees which makes them very
flexible and as you can see with me I
like to quality chest a juror do a
durability test on these headphones and
they pass the test with flying colors
guys they're very durable very
well-built and they feel absolutely
awesome to hold so the quality of these
things is second to none they're really
good guys as for sound quality guys
these have 40 millimeter neo dynein
magnets in them and as you can see me
with my fingers I'm showing you how
thick the headphones are themselves as
you can see they have very good speakers
built into them and they feel kind of
heavy so their quality speakers guys
that they put into these headphones and
I have quality tested them but I'll get
onto that later now let's look at the
actual headphones that you get so this
is the silver model guys and as you can
see here when I told it to the right it
has a th - Pro 500 written on both ears
guys has the nice audio technica symbol
and mine says the monitor headphones are
safe for DJs the cord itself - is
fixated to the headphones as well and
it's non detachable and for me that's no
problem the bezel around the ears is
made of like a leather I think it's real
leather feels like it and it's very
comfortable on your ears guys the inside
of the speaker has got a little foam
over the speaker however that is a
little bit hard and the actual plastic
and the feel of the headphones
themselves feels really really really
solid okay I can't stress this enough
these things feel awesome okay as to the
fit of these headphones
they are adjustable on both sides and
the band is steel now they will fit
small to large heads however you need to
be careful with ear size guys so the
cups are reasonably small it's about six
centimeters they fit my ears fine I have
average ears but if you have large ears
you may wish to be pretty careful with
these headphones as for comfortability
guys these headphones clearly are a
winner I have worn mine for four hours
straight and they're really really
comfortable and they don't hurt your
ears and also on the top of the
headphones so not this the ear pieces
but the top of the headphones also have
a nice comfortable leather there as well
as for the cord guys the cord is 1.2
meters long and is a retractable coiled
cord it also comes with a six point
three millimeter stereo jack adapter
which is gold-plated and it does screw
off it feels really well built and as
you can see here I'm screwing off which
allows it to go to a 3.5 millimeter jack
and I can screw it back on but I like to
use it in steerage and as an added in
bonus Audio Technica also throw in a
leather case which I think in my opinion
adds to the overall qualitative feel of
this product and it is awesome ok guys
in closing I want to talk about the
sound quality and comfort of these
headphones again and as I mentioned
before they have 40 millimeter neodymium
magnets the sound pressure level is a
hundred decibels and the frequency
response is ten Hertz all the way up to
thirty thousand Hertz which is a great
frequency response
now the impedance is thirty-eight ohms
and the weight without the cord is 280
grams and that being said the 280 grams
of these headphones makes these really
comfortable for long sessions where
you're listening to music or you're
gaming whether it be one of the other or
both now lastly guys I want to say that
I went from a razor carcase headset to
these headphones and the difference was
night and day these really are great
headphones and I'm not an audio kind of
guy I don't really know the difference
between good headphones and bad ones but
I can certainly notice a difference here
and these are phenomenally better than
my razor
in terms of sound quality they have
clear eyes clear mids and very
responsive and sensitive Bates was
sucking here so I could really hear the
bass when I was playing games and it
sort of changed it was like rumbling my
ears it was really cool and I highly
recommend these headphones guys so if
you'd like this review please give it a
thumbs up and if you like my other
videos please subscribe if you have any
questions please leave them in the
comment section below so any guys peace
out for now bronies Ebates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
