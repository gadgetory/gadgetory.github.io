I've seen the reviews I'm yet to do my
own because the cards were sent so far
after NDA was lifted that I just haven't
had time to do a proper review yet
that'll be coming but I did watch bit
Wits video where he coupled it with an
OEM system and although he had some
troubles he did eventually get it
working and it was an option if you were
looking to get into PC gaming but since
2014 and when the 750ti launched a lot
of those options for sort of going with
OEMs can present problems there are a
lot of boards out there that just simply
won't support the 750ti the 1050 Ti or
the 1650 but since 2014 as well things
have changed big time where a lot of
people aren't even looking for an OEM
system they're just simply too ugly
aesthetics is playing a big role and
honestly you can get aesthetics for real
cheap on a build nowadays as well as
power supplies being relatively
inexpensive now one thing I will
critique about the 1650 straightaway
though is where is the low profile
option I've looked around everywhere
and I can't see one maker that's made
the thinner version that would go in
some of those OEMs that are going out
really cheap but today I'm gonna try and
find a purpose for this card and that is
coupling it with the recent budget combo
I got for 120 bucks if you guys haven't
seen that video I'll put the link up
here where an actual big benefit of this
system which had a cease cause Eon was
that it was using under 90 watts from
the wall and also coupled with the GTX
1660 and the performance was
surprisingly really good so let's chuck
this in we're also gonna chuck in an Rx
570 and see what performance we can get
for the wattage do you sometimes want to
be camouflaged and you like fancy RGB
lights but you still want good
components onboard your motherboard well
if so the z3 90 still legend from asrock
has you covered coming in with a decent
price point - it's one for a serious
contender for someone looking to get on
the intel knife gent it's links in
description below so what we've got now
is three different cards here two gtx
1650s one of them being the Galax
Virginia other being the no PCIe 6 pin
gigabyte edition
so if anything we're gonna see which of
these uses law power compared to one
another honestly my bet is on the galaxy
card because in the last year all the
cards have sent through here have been
very power efficient and then we've got
the RX 570 which I picked up on a deal
for $80 this is really good value for
money practically not going to get much
better than this considering these are
on the used market everywhere and even
brand new they're really good price
performance and that's been the biggest
detriment to the 16:50 so far is that
this exists and the price for it is
really inexpensive but without a side
let's put these three cards through this
little rig right here and see how much
power they use for what performance
numbers they give out
so we just now finished the testing with
three different graphics cards testing
out Apex legends as well as Monster
Hunter Woolwich from the previous video
you guys requested that I test this is
it was cpu-intensive and then we also
tested out a shadow of the Tomb Raider
and the numbers are as expected the RX
570 is coming well ahead of the GTX 1650
it is doing so though on average with
about 80 to 85 watts more power
consumption depending on the benchmark
now the difference between the Giga Byte
and the galaxy card surprisingly was
virtually nothing both across the
numbers and the power consumption so I
guess on this particular gigabyte model
with no PCIe 6 pin requirement and same
with the guys card
they have tune these v biases for
efficiency as there are some other
models out there that do require the 6
pin and I'm guessing they use a little
bit more power than these two cards
otherwise would now in terms of
measuring both these cards up they come
just under 200 mil in length so you will
need to accommodate for that but one
thing I can't get my head around is just
there is no low profile option for
either of these cards and now with the
1050 Ti we did see that low profile
option and that gives us the option to
then put it in some of these small
form-factor sleepers as you otherwise
would know them as if you put this card
inside because the performance is pretty
decent I mean 1080p high settings across
shadow of the Tomb Raider getting 50 fps
and then moving over to Apex legends
again high settings getting 60fps and
having good one percent point one
percent lows is nothing to laugh at as
well as monster hunter world playing
quite well I mean if you drop the
settings down to say a blend of high and
medium on the other two titles you will
get that 60fps figure and you'll do so
with the whole power consumption coming
under 150 watts so to pretty much run
with any single power supply out there
and this combination I guess the only
person it would be good for is someone
who is maybe wants to save the
environment but has an addiction to PC
gaming but as we can see with the
numbers here with the rx 570 that thing
is coming
with more performance it's currently
cheaper both on the new market and the
used market I mean with the use market
you can pick these things up for next to
nothing I mean I got one for about 60
USD we'll actually got quite a few for
60 USD not just one and at this price
their phenomenal value for money and I
mean is that 80 watts worth it I mean
most gamers on average I'd say would
game for about three to four hours a day
some would game a lot more some would
game a lot less so I'm guessing if
you're a World of Warcraft addict and I
guess you play this game 16 hours a day
then that power consumption could add up
quite quickly and you could save some
money actually in the long term going
with the 16 50 over an Rx 570 but it
would take a while I mean you'd have to
do the math on how much you pay for
power and where you are in the world but
in Australia per kilowatt-hour it is a
little bit expensive but again that
price difference 60 USD on the use
market for an RX 570 which is what I go
for versus a hundred and fifty USD on
the new market for a 1650 that's a big
price difference and also coupled with
the fact that there's no low profile
option it's kind of getting a little bit
hard to see where the 1650s sort of
slotting in because the 16 60 TI even
though it costs more is using GD r6 so
in ways it's actually a more efficient
card in the total power performance
arguments there's also the argument that
cheering cos don't perform a whole lot
better than Pascal cos and you're only
getting just over a hundred cuda cores
with the 1650 versus the 1050 TI
and you're still getting four gigabytes
of vram and 14 nanometer down to 12
nanometer so not a whole lot has changed
in that time since when the 1050 TI was
released in the 1650 came out so I would
have liked to have seen a bit more out
of this graphics card but I guess we'll
have to wait for a video to drop down to
seven nanometer as well as to see what
AMD does with their Navi solution to see
if it can sort of compete what for what
with these performance numbers because
they are pretty good it's just that the
rx 570 at its price performance argument
is currently offering more
that's already been out for quite some
time so all the arguments that you guys
have heard currently they pretty much
ring true I personally think for how
long it's been since the 1050 TI was
released and since this is released I am
NOT that impressed at all with that said
I will be adding a lot more graphics
cards into the mix throwing it onto the
9900 ke test bench and then giving you
guys a full fledge review for these 1650
Galax cards - stay tuned for that if you

section below love writing them as
always and I'll catch you guys in
