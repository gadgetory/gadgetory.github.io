what is crack-a-lackin' today here we
have a metro Exodus PC and we're going
to be using two parts in this build that
a new the rest is going to be used
price-performance but before we take a
look at what we got on the table here
let's take a look at the minimum and
recommended specs of this game to get an
idea of where we want to come in with
this PC
so Metro Exodus is the third installment
in the series coming after Metro last
light which was released quite some time
ago and the minimum requirements for
that was like a Core 2 Duo and a quad
core of no name in particular but this
time around they are being a little bit
more specific with what they want your
CPU and GPU configurations to be for
instance the minimum requirements are an
i-5 44 40 which is a quad core and they
also recommend you come in with either a
GTX 670 or a Radeon HD 7870 and then for
recommended specs they're asking for an
i7 4770k a gtx 1070 or in RTX 2060 now
the ITX card is apparently important
here because this game does support some
of those r-tx features but we'll be
testing that out later in the video
let's take a look at what parts we have
on the table now here's what we've got
on the table here we've got a case
that's over 10 years old is from 2008 I
got this on a bargain for 80 or z
dollars now some of the other used deals
that I got they were really good was
this power supply and also CPU cooler in
a combo package for 30-odd Z dollars
we've also got a used SSD used hard
drive and used 16 gigabytes of RAM as
well as an i7 3930k now this is a 6
quart 12 threaded CPU that is
overclockable however this motherboard
here doesn't allow us to overclock but I
am curious to see how this CPU will
perform in Metro Exodus once we compare
it with the 9900 can we'll do that a
little bit later in the video because we
are going to be using the latest and
greatest RT X 2060 which is a decent
card for $350 but we'll be finding out
how well it plays in this game now if
you guys are itching to put something
together that's similar to this build
then I'll put some links in the
description below with that aside let's
get this build on the way
so now we've completed this build and I
am just so impressed with this case I
mean 2008
it's got RGB on it so you can actually
change the colors on the side here to
whichever color you want and you can
turn it off if you want and the fan does
a really good job of cooling down the
whole motherboard and your whole system
and then underneath that you've even got
a really quiet small fan to cool your
hard drives and your SSDs so this case I
just think it was ahead of its time the
form factor of it it's pretty small as
well if you guys know the Aero cool
strike X this thing's like literally
half the size and I mean the only
critique I can think about it is
probably that it is hard to build in but
once you building this thing it just
looks phenomenal it's amazing it's so
quiet - to the point where my rig over
there I can hear my main rig on idle is
actually louder than this from where I'm
standing and it's honestly just
impressed me that much I mean with a bit
of fiddling we managed to get the
Coolermaster to 12 X just fit it inside
here and the graphics card the r-tx 2060
just fit as well so you will have
problems if you try to fit an extended
PCB on the graphics card in this case
and in this case I actually had to pull
the shroud out off the top so I could
screw the cooler in and once that's out
that thing's not going back in so it's
pretty cool though I can just sort of
have a little hurricane up the top of my
case now the law other side is finally
time to install Metro Exeter's I'll also
install Apex legends and we'll see how
this thing performs and then we'll chuck
the r-tx 2060 on the 9900 Kay and see
the difference between this rig and a
9,900 cape - these two particular games
so the build and the benchmarks are here
and we've got a lot to talk about first
of all Metro Exodus how did this bill
perform versus the r-tx
2060 in the 9900 K well the results are
looking pretty good
I found an area where I could get high
FPS and then replicate the scenario and
here we got 147 average with the 3930k
and 94 and 74 17.1% lows versus the 9900
K which got 163 105 and 98 respectively
in dx12 now I did manage to switch over
to DX 11 and I didn't really notice much
of a difference here it got a little bit
higher FPS 167 105 and hundred
respectively but when it came to this
game itself and trying to test out RTX
features and DL SS it was actually
broken that's the best way to describe
it at first I thought it was the ex 79
system and the 3930k is like okay maybe
you got to get on the latest and
greatest hardware for this to work but
sure enough changed over to that rig and
that was having problems as well the 99
hundred K again when I go to turn on DL
SS it would just automatically turn it
off and then I turn on RT X and the same
things were happening it was just
automatically turning them off and
apparently there's some hard fixes for
it but it's like guys if you're spending
eighty to Aussie dollars or 62 u.s.
dollars on a video game
you shouldn't have to fix anything the
game should be fixed without the public
being beta testers for your particular
video game so that annoyed me but in
terms of Metro Exodus itself the
storyline already had that flare I am
getting a little bit sucked into it it
is an enjoyable game so far so I look
forward to playing it a little bit more
and the performance is pretty smooth as
we see with those 1% and 0.1% lows this
game does play pretty smooth providing
you have a good hardware but it will run
on lower and Hardware absolutely fine as
well providing you turn down some of the
settings here we're playing at 1080p
Ultra even turned it up to 1440p Ultra
and the results are still very good also
in the open area because I did test
inside when I was doing the direct
comparison in the open area
the FPS does drop a little bit more but
moving on now to Apex legends and the
difference between the two rigs this
time was even less the 3930k with the
RTS 2060 scored 115 average FPS 73 and
62.1% lows and then we move over the
9900 Kay and that got 119 84 and 71 now
there's a little bit of variance here
since it is a multiplayer title but this
game is very well optimised for the CPU
end and it is very GPU intensive so it
was good to see that the RT X 2060 I'm
pretty much very high in high settings
was doing very well but of course guys
what about the costs of the build and
what should you do if you're in the
market for something like this rig well
I tallied together what you could expect
to pay if you bought this same rig at
market prices sort of like Buy It Now
and you're looking around at eight
hundred and forty US dollars or in
Australia around about twelve hundred
and forty Aussie dollars now this is
where I save money because I go get used
deals I tallied up that I saved around
two hundred and thirty
Aussie dollars by getting a used cpu
that was cheaper than market price used
Ram and also that power supply and
cooler combo as well as the hard drive
and SSD so I did save a lot of money
here on these deals and that really
brings the price down without affecting
performance whatsoever but if you're in
the market to build this PC at Buy It
Now prices this is where I would suggest
changing the motherboard CPU and RAM to
something like Rison 526 hundred because
I tallied up the costs and it's pretty
much exactly the same money that you
would be spending if you were to go out
and pay a hundred US dollars for a 3930k
for example or the zealand equivalent
the e5 1650 the ram you'd be paying
around 72 US dollars when the ddr4 costs
one hundred US dollars for a 16 gigabyte
kit and then the motherboard in this
case we're using the running x79 that
costs one hundred and thirty US dollars
and then a B 450 for example can be had
for eighty US dollars so you're saving
money on the motherboard you're spending
an extra fifty US dollars on the horizon
five twenty six hundred and then you get
a cooler included with that so you don't
have to go out and buy a cooler master
212 for
so there it Elizabeth the r-tx 2060 and
the i7 3930k that cpu is still
absolutely fine for playing titles in
2019 and as you saw this running board
it could only get the CPU up to 3.9
gigahertz across those 12 threads and
six cores so if you were able to
overclock it higher on a better x79
multiple that you got on a deal for
example you could expect the gap between
that and the 9900 K with an RT X 2060 to
become even smaller so it was very small
to begin with but also I will quickly
reiterate if you guys are in the market
for something similar to this then
definitely go out and buy rise at 5:00
2600 and don't pay those asking prices
unless of course you live on a remote
island where you can't get access to
those amazon.com prices for new parts on
rising systems but of course the last
thing to talk about before I get on out
here is that an Tek skeleton that case
just really impressed me that 20
centimeter fan just over your
motherboard it's BRM your graphics card
your CPU cooler
it just gives that airflow that I think
is just amazing since it's so quiet it's
so efficient and it just does a good job
of prolonging your component now I know
people are gonna say this case is
difficult to use as a benchmark system
and I agree I wouldn't be using this
thing as a benchmark test system I'd be
using it as a personal rig that you're
not gonna change the components on much
in terms of dust just go out and get a
data vac or something like that
especially if you're into PC building a
lot and you just hose it down every six
months with some good airflow but in
terms of the case itself I think it's
got a really small footprint especially
if you compare it to something like the
Aero cool strike act it's literally half
the size and it gets the job done
exactly the same and you can still get
this case I had to look on eBay
especially in the u.s. is someone
selling one for forty five US dollars
I'd actually pick one up for that it's a
pretty good price in Australia it's a
little bit more expensive from what I
researched but I'll put some links in
the description below for you guys for
everything featured in today's video and
also let us know in the comment section
below what you think of today's build
what would you change personally or put
in place off the case or the grand
