motherboards you hear of all these fancy
terms eight plus four phase power design
for example or even six plus three but
today I've got a special for you guys
never heard of it before and eight minus
four phase power delivery here on this
gigabyte motherboards so the story
behind this was in the previous can yes
fix it episode came into a motherboard
that had a blown up MOSFET and so what
we did with this and a lot of people
recommended I do this in the comments
was just completely knock out the face
but upon closer inspection the face I
saw that a few of the phases were
damaged so I decided to knock the whole
top line off and let's see if it works
all right now here it goes and that's a
complete fail
welcome back to tech yestiny this is
Brad coming to you guys today with
another episode of can yes fix it the
episode where you guys send in your
broken PC parts and you try and get me
to get them to work so we saw there with
that motherboard that motherboard was a
complete fail did not work even with an
8 - 4 phase power delivery no chance of
getting that working so I don't know if
there's something else I need to do to
get that motherboard working let me know
in the comment section below but also we
have a heap of different graphics cards
in the background there now the story
with these graphs cards was when I moved
out of my previous house I used the oven
to oven bake all these computer parts
because people were like dude throw all
these Burke and gravis cards that you
have and you've collected over the last
year throw them in the oven and I've got
hosed on these deals a lot of this but
deals by the way throw them in the oven
and just see if you can get them working
so we've got four graphics cards here
and as I said before a oven baked them I
believe it a hundred and eighty-five -
or 190 degrees for like 10 minutes so I
did follow a guide where someone said
they got their oven baked card fixed so
I followed that guy to a tee because
I've tried this in the past and it just
hasn't worked but they did come out all
all the cards did come out looking
pretty good it looked like that a solder
had rigged flowed so we'll see if that
fixes the problem but I did suspect that
at least on two of the cards the memory
was the problem so if you had a bad
memory chip I don't think I've been
baking that would bring it back to life
but hopefully some of these other cards
here will work I don't remember
specifically which card had which
problem but anyway we'll quickly fire it
up and if we get a signal out of it then
we'll put the cooler back on because if
we're gonna go to the whole trouble of
just putting the cooler back on and it
doesn't work then that's just a heap of
wasted time as well as thermal paste and
not only that if the card doesn't work
then we can just keep the cooler as well
because some of these GPU coolers do
come in handy but let's try and fly this
thing up
so this card actually was giving us a
signal to the capture card so we're
going to sideline this put the cooler
back on and then inspect that one after
we test the other three
so as we saw there with the galaxy card
that had the same problem as it had last
time and that was just the picture
coming out of it was just completely
munted so we're gonna chuck that on the
trash pile
so this is I believe is 7970 it was
broken last time and it's still broken
I've tried both the bar switches at the
back and the weird thing in two was
there was just really no heat coming out
of the GPU dye itself so perhaps one of
the phases is busted on the vrm not too
sure but that one that will be going in
the junk pile and we'll test the last
graphics card now so we did get a signal
out of this one but I'm pretty sure last
time this graphics card here was the i9
to ATO believable some of that I saw
when I got hosed on with a gum tree deal
but as soon as you boot it up into
Windows and installed a driver the
graphics car became buggy which I would
suspect it would be the one of the
memory chips but anyway it was booting
up again so we're gonna put the cooler
back on this card and also this graphics
card here which I think is the most
promising because I believe this didn't
give out a signal last time and it was
giving out a signal this time
so there are these guys the 7870 is now
back to life and to be honest I'm really
shocked I didn't think the oven baking
method would work on any of these cards
but at least one of the four cards is
now fixed by doing this up and bake
method so that is really cool so yeah I
guess the oven baked method it can work
and as other people have stated it is a
last resort method but we now have a
revived 7870 the r9 280 however as you
saw it just tried to boot up and once it
got to Windows it crashed out that was
the same problem I was having and since
the driver was already installed from
the 7870 it was installed after this got
in stalled and yeah it just clunk out so
this is the dud as well so we've got
three cards now that are duds but this
one here is working but let's check out
what other parts we can try and fix up
because we got a motherboard sent in
from Tim it has an i7 870 and it came in
a little bit dirty but they're just
saying that it didn't work so we quickly
gave it a cleanup with an alcohol wipe
and now it's looking pretty damn schmick
so we're gonna put this on the test bed
and see if we can get this to work
so there it is guys the motherboard here
is toast it is not working and this chip
here does have a bit of rust on it so
that could be the problem the i7 870
however that does work and that's
working really well so we got something
out of this thanks a lot Tim for sending
that in and this stick here the one
gigabyte stick surprisingly didn't work
on the gigabyte motherboard but the 8
gigabyte stick did so that was a little
bit weird but let's get onto the next
prize that we have here and this was
sent in sort of like it was pre broken
and there is two sticks of ddr3 memory
on it the Pentium it's got a pentium g
620 so I'm not too sure if that is any
good even if it does work I'm pretty
sure I couldn't really use a pentium g
620 on anything it's not that good of a
CPU at all especially when you've got
your ex 34 30s for seven bucks which
have doubled the cause and of course can
overclock this here so hopefully we can
pull some memory out of this if the
board doesn't work but let's fire this
up and see if we can get a signal out of
it
so there it is the h-60 one motherboard
the RAM and the CPU they all work
absolutely fine so perhaps it was just a
bad power supply or a bad graphics card
now the saddest thing is I forgot who
sent this in and I'm so sorry it's been
sitting on the shelves for quite a while
and I've just yeah I've been extremely
busy trying to set up the studio and a
huge backlog it won't happen again and I
promise that but this is working thanks
for that and I'll put this to good use
let's move on now to the next thing that
we have here and that is a I 546 70 K
and a stick of memory sent in from Dean
so he said this didn't work it might
have been a bad overclock or it might
just the motherboard might have been
toast but he wanted me to take a look at
it so we're gonna fire this up and see
if it does work
and testing the 4670 k out it looks like
it's indeed toast and there's no
physical signs of damage or anything
smoked up so what can happen sometimes
with CPUs like these is especially if
your auto overclocking some of the VTT
voltages can be set aggressively higher
like your memory controller chip for
example and it might not actually be the
CPU that dies it's actually one of the
controllers on board and so just be
careful with Auto voltages guys you
really have to be careful with that I do
suspect that's what happened here the 4
gigabyte memory stick however that works
absolutely fine so thanks for that Dean
this however is pretty much no coming
back from a warp to die so now the last
motherboard we have up here is a really
special case I got this sent in and I'm
not gonna name the person's name just
cuz it's it's just one of those things
that happens and the whole CPU socket
here was just cracked I've never seen
anything like it it was yeah the whole
thing was just cracked off so I thought
maybe if I position the CPU in the right
manner I can then try and get a signal
out of it and started up however that
was not to be the case this was
unfortunately just completely toast this
motherboard of course it is a really
nice motherboard it had the FX 8350 in
it so what I did for the person was they
came around and they swapped the
motherboard for a working 970
motherboard so this one just yeah just
be careful with your CPUs guys and how
you mount them and how much mounting
pressure you do place on the CPU socket
I'm not sure how they cracked this whole
socket cover off and the mechanism for
it but it just all came apart and yeah
there's really not much you can do with
that because CPU sockets if you replace
them they're extremely difficult to
replace you need some real specialized
equipment there are people in the world
that can do it but again for the for the
individual like you and me it's pretty
much completely out of the picture
especially for the amount of time and
the specialized gear that you need to
actually replace the CPU socket so this
one is unfortunately tow
as well so we're gonna drop that in the
bin as well and then we're just gonna
take a look what happened here today
however before we move on to a recap
right behind me here I have a special
guest on the channel this is the EVGA
sr2 LGA 1366 dual sockets with 2 X 56
90s I just want to boot it up see it
living and breathing in the flesh I have
to do it so the EVGA SR 2 that is
booting up absolutely fine we've got 12
cores 24 threads now I did have to shut
that down pretty quickly because when I
got into the blast one of the CPUs was
saying was at 96 degrees of course I'm
just free mounting the fans which I
usually never recommend anyone do unless
you're quickly booting up to see if
something boots or not that's generally
when you frame out just coolers because
saves a lot of time so in this case the
SR 2 and the 2 CPUs are working
absolutely fine
looks like the Rams are working too so
look forward to doing a build in that
I'm not sure when that will come because
it's gonna take a lot of times I want to
do something really special with that
but also a big thank you to you guys for
sending in the PC parts some of them
work some of them don't but the ones
that work you just salvage it and that's
what it's all about especially if you
come into broken pcs just salvage some
of the parts of work and then you can
mix and match and you'll have yourself a
really cheap gaming PC that's 7870 we've
got to stop here because the oven-baked
method did work I am shocked
I thought it would never work I've tried
it in the past but this time around one
of the four cards is now revived it's
now working and it was playing fortnight
absolutely fine so the oven-baked method
it can work as the last resort that's a
testament to that so give it a go if
you've got nothing else to lose and you
don't mind stinking up your house and
your oven by the way it does reek when
you do it so be careful maybe use an
oven that you're not used to using but
with that guys if you have any pea
see parts that you don't no longer need
or you just want to send them in and
they're broken and you want to see if I
can fix them and have a laugh then I'll
put my p.o box in the description below
and thank you all for watching and also
let me know in the comment section below
if you're digging the 8 - 4 phase power
design but also in there note of the
broken phases if you guys have removed
them and you have brought a motherboard
back to life let me know if there's
anything else I can do to try at the
motherboard working again because of
course bringing a whole motherboard back
to life is always a good thing the micro
soldiering is you guys saw the 2400 G
the Reisen I failed but I am sending
that off to someone in the u.s. they're
going to show me their micro soldiering
skills and they reckon they can get it
working again as when we personally have
tried micro soldiering in the past and I
am just hopeless at it it's such a hard
trait to learn and it's a lot easier
said than done in my opinion one of
those things I would like to learn
however but just take a lot of time to
learn properly but anyway guys hope you
enjoyed today's video if you did the me
sure to hit that like button and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
