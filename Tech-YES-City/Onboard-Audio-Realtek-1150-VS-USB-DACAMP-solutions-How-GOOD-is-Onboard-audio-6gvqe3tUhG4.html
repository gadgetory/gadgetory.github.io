how friggin good it is nowadays
welcome back to tech yes City ladies and
gentlemen this is brian coming back to
you guys today with a video on onboard
audio and just how freakin good it is
nowadays so when i recently performed a
review on the sound blaster a5 i was
doing some objective measurements with
room eq that's a program where you can
do an eq sweep but you can also test out
crosstalk as well and when I did the
crosstalk figures on when I did the
crosstalk tests on the onboard fatality
purity sound I found that that was
really good like we're talking less than
60 DB of difference there I mean more
than 260 DB of different sound crosstalk
which is really good figures that means
you guys probably wondering what's
crosstalk well cross talks essentially
when you're playing a signal through
your left channel for example and some
of that's leaking over to the right so
the less of the less crosstalk you have
the more true a stereo experience you
are going to get so if you've got really
high levels of crosstalk you're
essentially just going to be getting one
crap mono experience so when I'm judge
audio products nowadays I actually
really take a big focus on crosstalk so
whether you consciously up
subconsciously notice it I don't know
but you definitely subconsciously will
notice that so anyway this is one thing
that I had to get out of the way with so
onboard audio has come really far
especially the purity sound that's it
blew me away and then we got to get onto
the EQ when I did a room EQ sweep with
this motherboard I was surprised at just
how balanced it was now there was a
little bit of bass roll-off but when I
actually used a program called equalizer
Apo I could give the bass a nice 4 DB
boost there and that pretty much
eliminated the bass roll-off and so that
problem can be fixed with a free
downloaded program and I'll put that in
the link description below for you guys
so you can just download that I've got a
full tutorial for how to use equalizer a
peel as well if you're wondering how to
use it so that's pretty much the nuts
and bolts of this video is that onboard
audio nowadays especially the fatality
that recently reviewed the crosstalk is
freaky
Lo and it's like pretty much competing
with the USB decamp solution not only
that you get low input lag since it's
your onboard audio and yeah it's got a
good mic input which I'm recording from
now so I mean I'm just really impressed
with how far it's come and I just had to
share this with you guys and another
thing on that note as well is that the
Sound Blaster a5 that's got really low
crosstalk as well and that's a good unit
in its own so stay tuned for that review
there's definitely a lot of features in
this bad boy as well but anyway guys
that's onboard audio really damn good
it's come a long way and if someone
tells you that onboard audio is crap
then you may wish to ask them which
onboard audio solution are you talking
about because obviously on cheaper
boards there's going to be poorer
onboard audio solutions implemented on
those motherboards when we're talking
high in motherboards definitely from a
Xerox front they get a big thumbs up
from me
because I was just shocked when I saw
these objective figures you guys I hope
you enjoyed this video if you did please
give it a thumbs up and if you have any
questions or comments about this video
