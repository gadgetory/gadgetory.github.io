we do a episode called can yes fix it
and here we've got some more donations
sent in from you guys where you send in
broken pots or pots you just don't know
if they work and then I test them and if
they work I keep them I use them in
builds or if they don't work I do more
crazy stuff on them and try and get them
to the work to the point where I pull my
hair out but what we got here is five
different boxes from three different
people George is sent over a heap of
stuff again in the previous episode he
sent over a really nice x58 motherboard
he comes from a website JDM sales and if
you're an Australian you want some epic
used goodness then you might want to go
check out his website and also we've got
Ben as well as Edward they're sending
some goodies but I will say before we
check out these parts and what's in the
box I will give a big thanks to Bret
from above I T who donated a heap of
different parts last month and also the
king of the coast who will be getting
his own separate video because he's a
really good PC parts hustler he's
definitely on my level and the good
thing is he doesn't have to do any
camera work he's off camera so he's just
always on the grind so I look forward to
giving you guys that video with that
aside let's start digging in to this
package right here
so here's the first massive shipment
here from George and some of the stuff
is really crazy I haven't seen a power
supply that big before I don't know what
exactly this is like there's my hand
bang will quickly show you guys a
reference ATX power supply as well this
thing is gigantic and it's only 850
watts to so kind of a little bit
interesting definitely gonna try and put
a maybe a jumbo sized PC I've definitely
got a case for it as well
perfect case for that LED fans always
good to have we'll put them in the
stockpile I'm not entirely sure why this
got sent over it's 80 400 GS this thing
is a potato like in all shapes and form
so I don't know what I'm gonna do with
it about a HDMI port I could use it as a
testing motherboard scrappers car but
it's not even this case here really cool
cable extensions are absolutely amazing
we've got some coolers here as well and
a really weird cooler here and what is
this just like plug into your PC I port
and it just absorbs air like I don't
know it's a little bit weird a little
bit funky definitely we'll put that in
the build with the Jumbo jumbotron and
we've got here a really cool device as
well hard drive 3.5 inch docking bay so
instead of me having to always use SSDs
I can now just use one massive harddrive
store on my stuff on plug this into any
computer and I can get data off it
that's actually really handy got here a
Bitcoin as well I don't think it's the
real Bitcoin if it was I mean wow that'd
be a jackpot absolutely amazing got more
cables more thermal paste I'll add that
to the pile of already crazy amounts of
thermal paste that I already have and
then we've got some ddr2 memory here and
it's the overclockable kind so we've got
a lot of LGA 775 motherboards here so
I'm kind of guessing George wants me to
overclock some core to quads which is
exactly what we will do in some of these
builds of some of these LGA 775 boards
check out
so what we've got here now is from
Edward he's also sent in a letter we'll
quickly read that out but we've got RGB
strips a floor gigabyte ddr4 stick as
well it's always gold a little brown
horse awesome and the candy stick and
this here is really cool it's an AM four
server cooler but it's really low
profile it's really heavy too so if we
put this in a mini ITX build I'm
wondering if it'll cool like even a 2400
G for example that would be really
interesting to see but let's quickly
also there's some what they look like
decals here so we know put them on
something if we put them on builds maybe
they'll look cool but here's what the
letter reads hey Brian I'm Edward T from
the UK I've been a longtime fan of your
channel love every video you do
especially the parts on sand trips to
other countries you do keep up the good
work yeah bogan yeah mate thanks to you
I've learned so much that two years ago
I built my first gaming rig and have
since been hustling them used parts and
made some money buying selling and
building budget slash mid-range rigs I'm
also pursuing a job working with PC
servers etc I've sent you something you
might be able to use I picked up this
a.m. for cervical it's super low profile
and could help out with the in wind
chopin case perhaps or another mini ITX
rig God knows I won't need it I've also
included a sticker for gigabytes of ddr4
Ram that I purchased and seemed to be
dead on arrival don't know if you can
try reviving it I packed in some RGB
goodness for you to to add to your next
budget bill maybe and a toy from my work
I work breeding horses and also a stick
of rock from my local seaside town I
hope you enjoy the little gift box and
everything arrives in good conditions
kind regards Ed Wood big thanks to Ed
Wood we'll be testing out this ddr4
memory stick right here and it also is
the in wind Chopin let's roll that
dictionary
sharpen and last up here on the desk
we've got from ben is a b-1 50m bazooka
plus motherboard and also a letter so
we're gonna read this out quickly
hi Brian sorry it has taken me a little
longer than a couple of days since I
spoke to you on messenger this
motherboard came out of a prion gaming
system that I picked up from an IT
salvage auction it was the victim of a
failed all in one and some mishandling
I'd also like to thank you for the
inspiration to build my own gaming
system earlier this year I even featured
on my youtube channel Southern Cross
Tech you also inspired me to start
flipping used pcs and parts thanks again
I hope you can make use of this board
Ben mosey think about that right so now
we've got here on the desk some parts
that need to be tested we've also got a
lot of motherboards that we have to go
through donated from both the king of
the coast and Brett from above IT so
let's get through this massive gauntlet
so we went through a heap of different
motherboards tested out a lot of those
seven seven five boards worked some of
them did not so I've just chucked them
straight in the bin I'm not gonna waste
time with them because they were just
giving out no signal whatsoever if they
were giving out sort of like a half bias
boat I'd put them to the side and keep
them but one thing I did do with the
Zeus board is since it did have the same
BIOS as a previous 775 board I've got I
decided to pull the boss out of that the
chip and put it in that other
motherboard because I've been waiting
for this day this was the motherboard
that started all this used
price-performance hustle back in the day
I got this whole PC for $20 if you guys
don't remember then I'll put the link up
here to that video is just a vlog and it
sort of started the whole used price
performance hustle and we're gonna see
if that works at the end of this video
but what we got right here on the table
is the ddr4 motherboards mainly be 150 s
and H 110 which I picked up in a deal
this has an a 360 102 got this for $30
now we're gonna use some Nighthawk
memory here as well because we know this
stuff works it's brand-new and if this
CPU and RAM works then we can test out
these other model boards and make sure
they're okay or if they need a bit of
tacky-ass lovin we can give them that
too so this board we are getting a
signal out of it which is great news
because now we can just port the CPU and
RAM over to this motherboard here and
see if this works when I got this
donated to the channel they originally
had a G 45 60 in it and so since it was
a be 150 it just needed a BIOS update to
support that Pentium so the i3 6100 now
enables this to work we're gonna test
out that four gigabyte of ddr4 memory
and see if that works
so this ballistic stick here just kept
cycling it does not work
so we've just quickly bent back probably
over around ten pins now and I always
use a tooth pick it's my method of
choice also clean this out gave it just
maybe a phase-one techie ass lovin
that's just you know there's three
different phases phase one being just a
quick and easy phase 2 been somewhere
between and phase 3 being the whole
night yeah
but let's put the CPU in and see if this
thing from fire motherboard right here
ladies and gentlemen it is working
absolutely fine so that is the power of
even just a phase one tech yes 11 so
here we are now we have booted it up
after giving that vrm and nice cleaning
with the toothbrush because a little bit
of thermal paste did come off and we are
now booting baby so really when it comes
down to it I mean in the previous video
where I used a toothbrush
I was copping some insults from a couple
of dudes they thought it was funny you
know trying to rip into me this guy
doesn't know what he's talking about
yeah yeah I mean yeah just saved a two
hundred dollar board clearly I don't
know anything
so now we are finally here on the grand
finale this is the XFX
LGA 775 motherboard with ddr3 memory
support I am really hoping this thing
can do
so this board here we were almost ready
to give up on it we thought there was no
life in it it even had the ffs going on
but now we've put a heap of different
memory in tried swapping CPUs gave it a
bit of a data vac and now in the third
dim slot we are in the BIOS we are
posting so I think there was just a
little bit of life in it and it just was
surrounded by a heap of negative bad
energy bad voodoo perhaps bad mojo bad
juju
and once the yes was around at giving it
that positive energy it's absorbing it
all and now it is working again
one day he will rise again ladies and
gentlemen but today is not that day
and I was just about to head over to a
conclusion but another parcel rocked up
here from Justin Evans this is just in
time for the can yes fix it now he has a
gtx 980ti he says it doesn't work and he
wants me to try and get it working so
we're gonna give that a shot and check
if there's anything else in this box as
well and there is there's a a vga 450
watt power supply thanks heaps
so just clean the scraps cut up the
980ti
and we are getting a signal which is a
really good sign because that was only
just a phase one is what I'm talking
about the phases here today if a tech
yes loving or a tech yes cleanse now
that's really good news is the 980ti
it's working which is phenomenal and I
just can't believe it I was going to
resort to trying a new method of ironing
it that there's no need because
obviously it's such an expensive
graphics card you wouldn't want to risk
breaking it now that actually works so
we're just testing out the mumbo jumbo
tron power supply and it is working
absolutely fine and yes that is an RGB
power cable going into this mumbo jumbo
tron and here we are at the conclusion
of episode three of can yes fix it and
this one was easily the best so far that
x79 board got that working again that
980ti
got that working again and of course a
lot of those other motherboards went
through them a lot of them did end up
working and it was good because the ones
that I wanted to work at the very least
worked so I was really happy about that
and then some of that memory we went
through that quickly got it all done but
some of the other memories well did end
up working so that was really good we
salvaged some memory both on ddr2 and
ddr3 and finally that'd be 150 gigabyte
board that got sent in a long time ago
actually does work just needed a BIOS
update for that G 45 60 and
of course that ms:i be 150 I did not
think that would work at all but
laughter I bent back over ten pins and I
gave it a bit of a clean it did indeed
work again so that was you guys a bit of
magic a bit of patience and a bit of
time can definitely get some of these PC
parts working again a breathe new life
into them and I hope you all enjoyed
this one if you did then be sure to hit
that like button if you want to send us
some broken parts in stuff that no
longer works P o box will be in the
description below or I'll just put it up
here for you guys and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
do like a meme or whatever we can do a
