is the dark finally coming back to you
guys on the AMD platforms with an
overclocking tutorial now today I'm
going to be going over a four point two
gig overclock and a 4.4 gig overclock
and this is for all the people on the FX
6300 or the FX 8320 s or 8350 s as well
and first of all let's get on with it
anyway so I'm going to be going over a
lot of things but I'm going to be
keeping it as simple as possible as well
so the first two programs you're going
to need I recommend getting is Ida 64
extreme and prime95 now Ida 64 you get
you do get a it's a 30-day trial but
that is honestly more than enough for
finding a stable overclock and prime95
it's optional you actually don't need it
but I always liked it because it it
takes the temperatures higher than Ida
64 does however be careful with this
some people don't recommend it on AMD
platforms and then another optional
program here is Heroes of Newerth which
I find works great on both Intel and AMD
for finding unstable overclocks really
quickly and the good thing about this is
the game won't crash the game won't
crash I mean sorry the game only the
game will crash not your whole Windows
setup so anyway let's move on now put
the download link of these three
programs in the description below for
you guys so feel free to check them out
anyway let's restart the computer and
let's go into BIOS now something too
important to remember is that this is an
MSI motherboard so if you've got in a
Zeus motherboard a gigabyte motherboard
and asrock motherboard there may be
different names for things there may be
different settings so as soon as your
computer boots up you want to press
Delete
I also recommend having knowing how to
reset your CMOS that's an important
feature on this motherboard it does have
a clear CMOS button so you can just turn
off your computer hit that button and
reset all your defaults back to normal
if you come into a bad overclock so
let's move on now so this is the
motherboard I recommend putting it on
standard that's just got all the options
there
and this is if you're on MSI now update
to the latest BIOS if you haven't
already and basically I want you to go
into overclock so this is important and
today we're not going to be a test we're
not going to be touching CPU FSB
frequency or we're not going to be
touching RAM speeds because I don't
think I think those two settings are for
each other I honestly only found a
performance difference when I
overclocked the FSB speeds and it
increased my RAM speeds so Ram speeds
are pretty important for AMD and I mean
I will quickly show you at the end of
the tutorial what my custom Ram speeds
are for this rig but it's pretty simple
and it's not hard to do but anyway today
we're going to be focusing on the adjust
CPU ratio and we're going to be focusing
on adjust the CPU Northbridge ratio and
also the hyper thread link speed so
these three settings here are important
and they've also got three voltages that
are relative to them this is the CPU
voltage the CPU Northbridge voltage and
the Northbridge voltage I'll also be
talking about what settings to disable
and what settings you can keep are on
and what settings are optimal for gaming
also I highly recommend that you have an
aftermarket CPU cooler if you go to
overclock and you also have a decent
motherboard this is a mid-range
motherboard it's the 990 FX GD 65 from
MSI and actually if you're on another
motherboard manufacturer and it's a
mid-range or a high-end board you can
pretty much copy my settings today and
I'm pretty sure your overclock work and
that's because I'll get onto that later
that but mainly it's because the MS I
don't have a V group function on this
motherboard and that essentially is when
the CPU is under load the voltage drops
down and there's no function to
accommodate that and up the voltage when
that happens this motherboard doesn't
feature that which is one negative one
actual quite big one big negative with
this motherboard anyway let's move on
now so today we're going to be gift
firstly we're going to be going for a
4.2 gig overclock and now you'll want to
use your numpad and you are going to go
to 4.2 here and then we're going to
adjust now this
is important so 4.2 is a nice overclock
a lot of pretty sure that anyone on an
FX 8320 will be able to obtain this
overclock I haven't heard of someone not
being able to obtain a 4.2 gig overclock
on a decent motherboard with a decent
CPU cooler this should be obtainable on
anyone's rig let's look at the CPU
Northbridge ratio now even though 2200
megahertz is fine when I was doing my
testing I found that putting this to two
thousand four hundred megahertz made a
difference in games
so especially Skyrim which was the most
one of the most CPU intensive benchmarks
I did so putting this 212 made a
difference of three percent or two to
three percent in frame rates so I
recommend putting this 212 if you can if
your overclocks unstable you may wish to
dial this back down to 2200 megahertz
but that's up to you I do recommend
putting it to 2400 however CPU core
control we can leave that alone that's
if you want to disable cause manually
you can do that
Andy turbo core technology now I want to
disable this because pretty much when my
CPUs under load
I want it going to 4.2 gigs and when
it's not on load I want it clocking all
the way down to fourteen hundred
megahertz so you want to disable this
and put in I'll show you the other
features that you can put in later to
accommodate for this DRAM frequency I
put this to 1866 and I'll show you at
the end of the video but if you want to
overclock your ram I've got a ram
overclocking tutorial
it honestly Ram overclocking is pretty
much identical on the Intel's and AMD s
so I'll put my RAM overclocking tutorial
in the link below as I've already to
spend a lot of time doing Ram
overclocking tutorials and it honestly
takes a good 40 minutes which I keep
away honestly quick and dirty if you've
got XMP profiles you can just enable
them enable your best profile there your
higher speeds and that'll give you
should give you a performance bump over
the auto settings anyway let's move on
now to DRAM timing I like to put that on
anyway and I'll be overclocking my
memory later at the end of the video
just quickly showing you my settings but
let's move on now to the hyper thread
link speed this I found having this at
2600 was absolutely fine it doesn't go
any higher anyway on this motherboard so
you want to put this to 2600 putting it
down to 2400 I actually didn't make a
difference but I'd like to leave it as
high as it can go so I will in control
we don't have to touch that there
settings that I think it's like 8-bit
and 16-bit you'd have to bother touching
them leaving them on auto is absolutely
fine now CPU voltage this is the most
important feature because every chip
every single chip out there is going to
behave differently every single chip is
going to need a different optimum
voltage to run out I mean some chips can
run at lower voltage on the same clocks
than other chips for instance you could
have a chip that could run a 4.6 gig at
only one point three eight volts you
could be that lucky guy for me
personally I found that my chip at four
point two gigs runs at one point four
volt however keep in mind with the V
group on this CPU it does drop down to
about one point three seven volts and
I'll show you that later in the
stability testing so having this a one
point four five one point four volt
isn't not much to worry about MSI on
their motherboards actually have a limit
I actually have a safe limit threshold
so if you go over one point four five
volt your computer just won't simply
boot so keep that in mind I would say
one point four five volt is also pretty
much the safe limit for 24/7 overclocks
you wouldn't really want to go over that
anyway so it's not much of a
disadvantage of having an MSI board but
the Vedra p-- is that is one thing that
does annoy me because honestly if your
CPU can run at four point four gigs it
and it takes one point four four volt
under load then you won't be able to get
that on this motherboard because it
can't go up to one point four eight volt
which I would be perfectly happy running
with I am
I'll talk about it later but I am lucky
to have a motherboard that runs at 1.4
4.9 and V groups down to about 1.4 to
volt at 4.4 so I'm lucky than my chip
does just cut the limit at 4.4 but some
people might not be as lucky I mean some
people might be even luckier so this is
all a silicon lottery and I'm spending a
lot of time talking about this because
it's important to note that every chip
on this CPU voltage setting is going to
run is going to need different CPU
voltages so am I going to be better some
are going to be worse
however 4.2 gigs I imagine everyone
should be able to just dial in the CPU
voltage setting and they should be good
to go let's talk about this CPU
Northbridge voltage now honestly you can
just put this to 1.2 and leave it that's
pretty much for any overclock up to 4.2
gigs or up to 4.4 the putting this to
1.2 should be absolutely fine also this
one here I like to put this to 1.15 volt
as it runs pretty you know everything
runs pretty cool my motherboard doesn't
get hot at all and I like to give this
is pretty much safe settings you don't
have to worry about anything burning out
or and just but you when you're over
going 4.4 at least you'll know if you
put these to these limits you'll know
that they're not limiting you in any way
so having this at one point two and one
point one five is absolutely fine
that's not a problem at all let's move
now down to the extra features because
it is important you've also got
overclocking profiles here which will
save after we've confirmed that our
overclocks
are stable but let's move down down to
down to CPU features okay AMD cool and
quiet we do want this enabled
essentially when I was benchmarking I
did disable it however for general usage
you're going to want this enabled so
when you basically when you're gaming
your CPU ramped up when you're on the
desktop maybe just browsing internet
your CPU will ramp down in speeds which
will save you power it'll save your CPU
heat as
well I won't be putting out as much heat
so it's actually a good feature c1e this
is mainly for I like to use this on the
Intel's I don't like to use this on the
AMD's so keep that in mind the SVM mode
I disabled that I think it's a server
feature same with the iommu mode core 6
c6 state if you want your computer to be
able to hibernate that I recommend
leaving this enabled so excuse the
voices in the background someone's just
yeah that'll probably happen a little
bit throughout this tutorial but course
c6 state we want this disabled and hpc
mode we want this enabled this is AMD's
pretty much HPC mode is AMD's version of
c1e basically so this is the setting
that will ramp down your CPU to 1 volt
when it's not in use so it's actually
really good and I recommend it cause c6
state you can have this again you have
this enabled if you want your computer
to hibernate or sleep I generally don't
bother I don't if I'm not using my
computer for long times I turn it off
anyway so it's up to you guys but I
disable it ok so now with those settings
we are good to go
we're ready to boot into Windows and
start our stress testing you can save
this if you want to but since it's not
stable for me yet actually I will say
that I will save it because if it
crashes after say 5 or 10 minutes I can
then come back to this and quickly load
it up and then just tweak the CPU
voltage a little bit so we'll go here
we'll set the name and we'll call it 4.2
tests and then we'll save the
overclocking profile to overclock and
profile 1 okay so let's reboot this now
and go into Windows and start stress
testing that's what we're going to start
doing now so let's let's get in let's
get on with it so as you guys know with
all my overclocking tutorials I like to
do them uncut just to basically you know
show you that these are legit settings
and there
working everything's working perfectly
fine because I know and again I I know
there's going to be people out there who
are going to get frustrated and they're
not going to be able to obtain a certain
overclock but just when you take your
time and honestly I recommend watching
this whole tutorial and if you need help
put a comment in the comment section
below and I'll get back to you as soon
as I can so now that we're in Windows
we've seen and booted up absolutely fine
if your computer does not boot up then
you may need to give it more voltage or
you may not have your CPU cooler
adequately placed so anyway let's move
on now to sensor so we want to go down
to sensor here so we open i-264 up we go
down a sensor and it will display your
CPU this is the one I want you guys to
focus on also keep in mind your
motherboard as well the CPU call one I
believe these are readings are faulty
they're not actually right 90 as you see
there went down it's going down to 12
degrees I'm telling you now the ambient
temperatures in here are pretty much I
think they're there somewhere from 15 to
20 degrees I don't have an ambient
temperature checker so I can't tell you
guys exactly what the ambient
temperatures are in here but I
definitely tell you that these these
readings aren't correct I mean there's
no way that's eight degrees and so this
is the one you want to focus on 32
degrees and 24 degrees these two seem
about accurate and you don't want to
take it too much over that so anyway
with that being said let's move on now
we'll open up a thing called CPU Z so
Ida has its own CPU Z and I find it's
absolutely fine and then we want to open
up the stress test as well the system
stability test now you can use prime if
you want to but some and as I said
before some people say don't recommend
it on AMD's I mean I found it fine it's
a stability test if it can't run it then
your computer's not stable right so
anyway let's do this let's start it now
and you can see here it's clocking up to
4.2 gigs you want to just leave all
these settings ticked as well stress the
CPU stress the floating-point units
stress the case justice
just a memory I mean you want to stress
it all at the same time and and see here
we're going up to use 37 degrees which I
mean it's about what I mean it's if I
had to guess what the exact ambient
temperatures were in here I'd say I'd be
about 18 degrees so at the moment we're
running about 19 degrees over Delta
which is absolutely fine I mean this
overclock will be fine for the summer as
well I'd have no problems running this
overclock in the summer and also the
elapsed time so we'll run this for about
two minutes
honestly I recommend running it for a
good 10 minutes at least and then you
can start moving into games preferably
heroes in u.s. like I said before I
recommend this game it'll quickly find
an unstable overclock you may wish to
render a video as well that's also
another great way a real-world test to
see if your CPU is actually 100% stable
so with stress tests my main concern is
just quickly testing if the overclock is
near stable and testing that the
temperatures don't go to high so this is
my main two concerns when I do my
initial stress tests also we can see
here as I said to you guys before the
Vedra on this motherboard is actually
pretty weird and so even though I set in
1.4 volt you can see it's going down to
one point three seven one point as in
one point three six as well I mean there
we go it's going down so the V group on
this motherboard is a little bit weird
I see why people sort of stay away from
this motherboard but honestly it's a it
was a good value board it was actually
the only motherboard they had in stock I
got the Azusa on the board but that
unfortunately did not work properly so I
had to change and I got this MSI
motherboard and it works fine I mean for
a 4.4 gig overclock it absolutely worked
absolutely fine so here it is here so
CPU is running pretty good I mean we're
at 2 minutes we'll take it up to 4.4 now
that if I was testing this 4.2 for
myself I'd be opening up here as a new
earth and then playing a few games and
then maybe
during a video that's what I'd be doing
so but this I mean honestly this looks
pretty good to go the max temperatures
there are 40 degrees so not bad at all
we can stop that now so yeah again I'd
be trusting this here I'd be trusting
this one I don't think this one's
accurate maybe someone who's been a
longtime guru and AMD CPUs might want to
comment on this but I'd be trusting this
CPU score over these scores just make
sure that this apparently AMD recommends
not exceeding around about 60 degrees
Celsius so keep that in mind as well
don't go over 60 degrees on these FX
CPUs Intel's I mean they're all Intel's
are pretty much good up to 90 degrees I
think you can even take into a hundred
degrees they're just different
architectures so with the AMD you want
to make sure you're not going over 60
degrees
now that overclocked is pretty much
confirmed we can restart our computer
now if your computer crashes again if it
doesn't boot or if it crashes then all
you have to do is clear the CMOS so you
can do that via two methods if you're
but if your computer has a clear CMOS
button you can hit that or you can use a
C clear CMOS jumper on your motherboard
it's up to you guys so there actually is
two ways to do it there's a third way as
well that's the last method you should
use and that's just to take the power
cord out of your power supply turn your
computer on make sure the power is
drained and then take the CMOS battery
out as well that'll reset your CMOS as
well so anyway let's move on now so
we've done the 4.2 overclock okay so
that I mean theoretically that's stable
right I'm trying to save you guys a
little bit of time so we can say okay
overclocking profile one set nine four
point two what's going on here four
point two stable there we go so we've
got four point two stable we can save
that and then we can go and begin our
next overclock so if we go here now we
want to go for a four point four and I
mean if you want to I mean the good
thing is right if you're stable
if you do this the first time around and
you are completely stable you can maybe
bump it down maybe to a three 1.38
because you ultimately want to find the
lowest CPU voltage where your computer
is stable because that's going to save
you a bit of power it's going to save
you a bit of heat and also it's going to
give you if your overclock and give you
the highest speeds so you can do what
I've done here and you can if it's
completely stable the first time around
you can maybe bump it down to and if
it's not stable bump it back up one and
find your sweet spot for your CPU so
this is what this guy is all about is
finding the best voltage that your CPU
can run out now sometimes as well this
is the next overclock we're going for
and now this is important to note at 4.4
gigs I believe I have heard I mean it's
pretty rare but I have heard of some FX
83 20s and some FX 6300 s not being able
to run at 4.2 gigs so you might want to
go to full point maybe try 4.3 gig
overclock but keep in mind that if
you're an unlucky person and you lost
the silicon lottery you may not be able
to get to 4.4 like you can give it as
much voltage as you can you go to 1.45
and it just your computer just simply
doesn't work like it'll fail a stress
test or it'll crash occasionally and
that just means that your CPU just can't
even though it can boot at those
settings it ultimately just can't run
24/7 stable at 4.4 gigs and so that's
when you can use the CPU FSB frequency
to maybe tune out a 4.3 gig overclock or
something like that
that's up to you that's a little bit
more advanced but today I just want to
show you guys the basics on how to get
that extra 10% 20% out of your processor
especially on the FX 8320 which base
clock is only 3.5 gig so as we see if we
get up to 4.4 we're getting a
significant increase in speeds anyway
let's move on now so we're getting four
point four gigs 22 ratio again keep
these the same keep the Northbridge CPU
Northbridge frequency at 2400 keep this
at 13 so we're going to use the same
settings
we did with the 4.2 but all we're
changing this time is pretty much the
cpu ratio to 4.4 and we're giving it
more CPU voltage that's all we are doing
if I go to one point five one point four
five my computer just won't boot that's
MSI's hard limit and so keep that in
mind I'm just showing you guys now
anyone should be able to attain this
four point four gig overclock if you're
unlucky you may not be able to obtain
this so you can copy feel free to copy
my settings again we'll go down to the
overclocking profiles and we'll save
this as 4.4 tests so 4.4 tests and we'll
save that and then we will exit and we
will test this overclock out so that's a
let's move on down to the stress testing
this time around I will do prime95 as
I'll show you guys that it does get a
few degrees hotter on prime than it does
on Ida system stability test so that's
something important to keep in mind so
yeah I mean I'm again 4.4 is a nice I
think it's a sweet spot on the FX 8320
with mid-range boards maybe if you've
got a high-end motherboard you may wish
to go to 4.6 I hear 4.6 is what a lot of
people run their FX 8350 s at so
regardless you know you you guys I'm
just teaching guys simple the simple
ropes and you guys should be able to get
at least something extra out of your
CPUs on a stock cooler I mean that
people ask me what can I get on a stock
cooler I don't know I didn't like as
soon as I got my FX 8320 I didn't even
bother using the stock cooler because I
just pretty much got this CPU for
testing against the Intel so let's move
on now so we're going to get again we're
going to load up our CPU and we're going
to see the vault we want to check out
this CPU temperature here and you're
probably wondering are Brian you know in
your Intel overclocks use real temp and
prime and yes that's because real temp
only works on Intel's when I load it up
I was surprised to learn that it didn't
work on AMD rigs and
like okay that's cool but anyway so we
load up the stability test here we can
load up cpuid and we'll just do two
minutes of stress testing here again
okay so let's see we see here that our
computer is running fine after a little
while it should I mean if we close that
down it should clock down to one thing
about this is it should clock down to
fourteen hundred megahertz so the
multiplier should go down to seven when
the computers not load it up so we'll
we'll test that out I just want to show
ya there we go so you can see that when
you're not winning a pewter is not in
use it'll bump down to fourteen hundred
megahertz and the multiplier will go
down to seven that's when it's not when
your computer's not doesn't have any
load on it so that's a good feature you
see there the voltage drops down to one
volt as well which I recommend for if
you using this for a long time if this
is your main gaming rig anyway we'll go
back to senses we will get the stability
test rockin and let's start er up so
let's go hit start and we shall see one
hundred percent load oh yeah so again
keep these four ticked you don't have to
stress your hard drives or your GPU I'm
not doing a max power consumption test
here I'm just doing CPU overclocking so
look this time around it should go a
little bit higher I mean I imagine the
CPU should go to around about 30 I'd say
40 degrees it should probably hit 40
degrees maybe 22 degree Delta that's
what it hit when I mean it hit about a
twenty degree Delta when I was on my
strike X open air test bed and that was
I think the cooling is a little bit
better on that rig than it is on the
zelmans III plus I only slight I mean
not that much better it's not night and
day but it's a little bit better anyway
so we got here I'd say we've got it
we're going to reach a delta of about 22
degrees if we did this for 10 minutes
and may go up to 41 degrees and yeah so
just keep that on keep yeah so be
mindful of your motherboard and your CPU
temps and make sure they don't go to
high this being pretty good I mean this
APU temp here being pretty good I would
honestly just this would probably be
good for summer as well this overclock
here should be good for summer so anyway
that's that guys we're going to wait
another 40 seconds quickly and then
we'll boot up prime95 and you can see
here the video is going down as low as 1
point 4 volts so I think it usually sits
around one point for 2 volt in games ok
oh sorry it's dry in here yeah okay so
we wait for two minutes and we'll stop
that oh god okay I've got the plague so
we'll stop that that was fine we'll
start up Prime now and we'll run small
FFTs this is our pretty much RAM not
testing much so we don't need to test
Ram we just basically want to test the
CPU oh sorry
terribly sorry about this cough but um
we can see here that the Prime actually
loads up the CPU even heavier than Ida
does and so we can see here this V group
is actually pretty damn bad in prime95
so this is me this may be why you want
to run prime95 instead of actually
instead of idle because it's a real
intense CPU benchmark so as we can see
here the temperatures what going down to
43 probably will go up to 44 degrees as
well so that's something you want to be
mindful of I honestly I do like to use
prime even though piece so I've read
that people don't recommend prime for a
MDS
I think it's absolutely fine I actually
recommend it to find out what that max
CPU temp is going to go to so see here
44 degrees it's it's good to go so yeah
I mean my CPU is pretty good at this
setting so would I maybe I'd try in the
settings to tone it down a little bit
see what my CPU optimally can run 4.4
gig out but that would be for me to test
you guys as well you can find that out
and test it but I'll quickly show you
guys now also I'll quickly show you guys
now my ram overclocks as well so and
anything that I may have missed I will
talk about it quickly
so if you guys have any questions as
well again ask me and I'll reply as soon
as I can and you know if I if I don't
see your comment make sure you send me a
PM and I'll help you out as well so
sorry about my voices well it's dry in
here and I'm still I've got a bit of hay
fever as well oh god I missed a hit I
miss the del key God will restart that
one so anyway let's do this in camera so
this is on an SSD at the moment as well
the computer's boot boots up really
quickly on if you don't have an SSD I do
recommend getting one so sorry my
computer oh my dears a lot actually
overheated before I could before I could
actually get in to show you guys the RAM
speeds so that being I didn't even
notice like I did everything and then
later what my camera turned off so as
you can see I've already dial it all in
but I will show you what it's like on
default so here we go default 1333 now
that honestly for an AMD with the mid to
mid-range GPU I would honestly be put
special like a GTX 670 I'd be pushing
this to 1866 because in some cpu-bound
games I've found that if you tune your
ram especially as opposed to auto you
can pick up almost like even in Skyrim
you can pick up almost a 10% fps
increase that's what I found with I
found that out in the past when I was
actually testing Ram speed stock versus
even just XMP profiles so it's important
to get your X and P profiles in even if
you don't know how to overclock memory
but I'll quickly show you guys what my
memory speed this is a different memory
to what I'm actually using in my main
rig and what I did my testing on so this
Ram will behave a little bit differently
to my main ram ultimately though a
minutes it's standard I think the stuffs
a little bit worse too so I mean I've
got the timings in here to t90 10 to 90
and I like
to have the tier ass as I've tested in
the past I like to have the TRS relaxed
a little bit the sum of all these three
plus one or two seems to be the best
setting for the tier ass now you guys
are welcome to copy my ramp settings
like please by all means if you want to
have a try at overclocking ramp you can
copy my settings here and however I will
point out though with DRAM voltage so
this is usually 1.5 volt
I do recommend not going over one point
six five volts so honestly keep it safe
don't go over that even one point six
volt around about one point six volt I
don't recommend going over especially in
summer it's just one more component that
may fail if your RAM gets I've heard of
people frame their RAM at one point
seven volts so just be mindful of that
honestly one point six volt should be
good though should be safe definitely
should be a safe level for any ddr3
memory so again that's you guys welcome
to try mine ddr3 settings and I mean
this stuff that I'm using in this rig is
actually not that good it's got no heat
sinks at all it's like even the XMP
profile here is like sixteen hundred
eleven eleven twenty eight which is
pretty much the worst Ram you can get so
this stuff here I mean the fact that it
goes to ddr3 at you know two nine ten
nine thirty you guys should be able to
copy those settings and the voltages and
your RAM should work if it doesn't then
maybe give it a little bit more voltage
or maybe just put it back to 1600 and
give 1600 ago but you definitely don't
want it on 1333 that's not that good in
my opinion so anyway we'll give this a
whirl we'll save this we'll save this in
overclocking profiles as our final
whatever we can set name for it four
point four gigs
final sweet sweet sweet OC and we can
save that and we can then jump into
Windows and we are good to go so yeah
I'm going to close out this video by
saying if you
does have any questions at all about
this CPU overclocking tutorial then
please leave a comment in the comment
section below if I don't get back to you
on its urgent then send me a PM as well
and I'll get back to you as well so yeah
definitely
ok this uh yeah I think this Ram isn't
even stable at one point six volt ok so
we're gonna I'm glad you guys could see
this because pretty much you just what I
do if something like this happens I just
hold my power button down I then what
I'll do now is I'll then hit my clear
CMOS button at the back turn it back on
and the computer should work absolutely
fine I mean so yeah there we go make
sure we hit that Delete key
I'm glad I'm actually glad you guys
could see this um it just what happens
is is that yeah it doesn't the RAM
obviously the RAM here wasn't stable at
one point six volt which was surprising
so we can put all our CPU will put our
CPU ratio back to I mean all we can just
this is the good thing about
overclocking profiles right you can just
load your overclocking profile we had it
here oh sorry there's that nasty plague
coming back again let me give it a bit
more voltage I mean maybe one point six
one volt give it a little bit extra
voltage and just make sure that I'm
going to make sure that XMP was disabled
as well ok yep disabled okay so let's
try this now I mean it should work ok
save configuration we're given the RAM a
little bit more voltage and hopefully it
runs might have to relax the timings a
little bit too but not there it is so
the RAM obviously it wanted a little bit
more voltage than 1.6
yeah start Windows normally it wanted a
little bit more voltage than 1.6 and I
gave it that and it was all good to go
so there we go that's now that's that's
my red guy so that's stable at one point
four point four gigs and so yeah if you
have any questions please leave a
comment in the comment section below and
I really look forward to your feedback
if you enjoyed this video and if it
helped you get some extra speeds out of
your am deed and please give it a thumbs
up and if you haven't really subscribed
attack your city and I'll be coming back
to you guys with some more tech video
quality isn't the best I'm using my cam
made my DSLR mirrorless DSLR and I'm
pretty much recording just you know from
the desk with the camera facing the TV
so I mean if I could get a HDMI capture
card with an output input I would get
one but you know it's like two hundred
dollars and I really I don't do many
tutorials like this usually most much
tutorials are on the desktop where I can
use Camtasia or I can use shadowplay you
know so for games so yeah these are sort
of like I don't do a lot of these over
going tutorials and so I can't justify
you know I'm a small tech channel I
don't have a lot of money I can't really
justify spending $200 on a HDMI capture
card just for a little bit of better
video quality on some my over crunchy
tours but again I apologize for the
video quality not being as good as some
other tutorials out there but I hope the
content was good and that's the main
thing I want to keep giving you guys at
tech yes City anyway I yea want to hear
your feedback and peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
