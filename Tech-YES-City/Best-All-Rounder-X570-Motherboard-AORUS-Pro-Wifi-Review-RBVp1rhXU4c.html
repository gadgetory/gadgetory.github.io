review though this time it's from Oris
with their x5 70 pro Wi-Fi except the
one I have here on the test bench
doesn't have Wi-Fi and I'm told it
doesn't have a price tag so we're gonna
treat it like it's the Wi-Fi which is
coming in at 269 USD and if your
interest rate of 469 Aussie dollars now
I know there's some people out there in
the audience they're gonna be saying it
was a dates give me the dates and that's
exactly what we're gonna be doing here
today going over the VRM testing that
with the 3900 X at 4.30 that's all cool
over clocks and testing out onboard
audio testing out the nick speeds USB 3
speeds and unfortunately though since
this board here doesn't have Wi-Fi I
can't test out the Wi-Fi speeds for you
but I would assume that they are all a
ok or I mean a horas ok and with us
let's check out this board
welcome back to take your city and
without wasting any more of your
precious time we've got a fourteen phase
vrm where 12 of the phases are doubled
that's for the CPUs we're looking at a 2
by 6 solution there with the double of
being the Infinia and I are three five
nine nine and then for the PWM
controller they're using the IR three
five two zero one then for the MOSFETs
we've got the dr. Maas direct drive
MOSFETs this is the Infinia an IR pal
our stage 40 amp MOSFETs and then for
the SOC they're using two direct phases
these are known as the P pack to h2l
MOSFETs now for the chokes these were a
little bit of a tricky bugger to find
some information on from what I gather
they are TDK 50 amp inductors and then
for the capacitors we're looking at a
pack five K capacitors now of course the
main thing with of erm is testing out
the overclocks and we've got here a 3900
X juicing about 140 watts and this put
on the heatsink a 52-degree surface
temperature none of the MOSFETs I was
reading 62 degrees so everything is
absolutely fine on this vrm it'll be
easily geared up towards the 39 50 X
overclocked on air or water and also in
that regard the heatsink itself has a
fin design over the CPU vrm section and
weighs in at 149 grams now speaking of
heat sinks have also got these over the
two nvme slots which are PCIe 4x4 and
testing out the speeds they'll
absolutely find the heat sink ways in a
31 grams the temperatures with this
heatsink arm was 54 degrees on the
surface and then 60 degrees in the
software
having no heatsink on in this board saw
the temperatures on the surface go to 92
degrees and then 81 degrees in the
software this is repeatedly spamming it
and an odd thing about that too is if
you don't have the heatsink on it will
throttle so it's highly advised to use
the nvme drive especially on the pci gen
4 solutions with a heatsink on
so overall the vrm on this board does
check out of course what I've seen with
the trend with the X 570 boards and what
I've least spoken to with the
motherboard manufacturers is they are
simply over engineered and they're all
looking at high overclock 16 core in
mind in terms of what they can support
up to so 3900 X just like the Taichi I
recently reviewed absolutely no problems
on this board you won't need any active
cooling solution though on that note of
active cooling solutions that
is a small fan on the platform chipset
hub and I didn't report on this on the X
570 Tai Chi review so I'm sorry for that
I forgot but the noise is so inaudible
so both horas on this board with the pro
Wi-Fi and also asrock with their Taiji
I've done a good job of implementing
something that is of low noise now what
about the onboard audio here they're
using the realtek ALC 1220 - VB and I
found with a frequency response curve
the numbers were absolutely phenomenal 0
to 20 Hertz well should I say 0 to 10
Hertz only saw a negative 2 decibel
drop-off and then between 10 and 20
Hertz so literally like a point 0 5
decibel drop off so phenomenal figures
the rest of the line was pretty much
flat throughout the whole frequency
response curve with a little bit of a
dip though from 10 K to 20 K of only
about point 2 decibels so this solution
will be pretty much great for powering
any sorts of cans whether they're
mid-range high end if they're not
although dynamics I did try to use the
headphone amplifier built-in to power
some auto dynamics and it was so close
to getting them at least at a functional
level but unfortunately it was not to be
quite yet so if you do want to power
things like auto dynamics I would
recommend a discreet amp now speaking of
the crosstalk this is phenomenal to -91
decibels and the hundred volume up to
this level there's absolutely no leakage
whatsoever so that is perfect the
balance between the left and right
channels is also perfect and then the
mic import at least for onboard audio is
the best I've seen yet with having
absolutely no noise even with noise
suppression turned off and that's
bumping it up to 30 decibels 100 volume
so basically this means you can use this
for streaming or use it for audio
recordings of course if you do want to
step it up to a professional level I
would recommend getting a professional
solution for recording but as it stands
if you want to stream on this mic import
and play games with the audio out it's
gonna be absolutely phenomenal
so the vrm checks out the onboard audio
checks out going through the rest of the
features we've got five PCIe Gen 4 slots
three of those being 16 X 2 of those
being X 1 and this will support
crossfire 3-way and also MV Quad SLI
with envy link now this board will also
support thunderbolt if you get the
adding card it has the thunderbolt
adding connected down the bottom of the
motherboard and now going over the rear
of the motherboard we've got 4 USB 2
ports and below that HDMI port and then
for USB 3.2 gen 1 and then 1 USB 3.2 gen
to Taipei and then a type C and then
above that is an Intel Gigabit LAN which
I tested the speeds out on this
absolutely fine and then below that is
your optical out and your manual 5.1
Jack's with your headphone out mic in
and also line in now going through some
of the other features onboard this
motherboard they've got cue flash plus
otherwise known as BIOS flashback a
thing that's coming out on pretty much
every X 570 motherboard you've got 7 PWM
fan headers as well as your 12 volt and
5 volt addressable RGB headers for RGB
control however on this board you will
have to install the RGB synchronization
software RGB fusion to which I have made
an update to but I will critique this I
do like the BIOS implementation for
instance on the X 570 tight you the
asrock implemented and I'd like to see
gigabyte doing that there stopping
through the BIOS which is a very
important part of any motherboard and
it's great to see gigabyte and horas
have stepped up their game at least on
this motherboard in particular it's a
lot easier to navigate now you don't
have any plus or minus voltages you just
lock in that particular voltage it's
easy to get to those settings and you
can save up to seven different profiles
and control the fan headers individually
making your own custom fan profiles and
applying that to the rest of the fan
profiles if you wish to now go through
some of the finer details on this board
the top to 16x slots have what they call
PCIe steel armor so if you're into
bending unsecure graphics cards and
trying to break PCIe slots this is going
to be a great solution for you there's
also a neat feature that they're
offering two USB 3 outs for a total of
four USB ports on a front panel and also
in addition to that two USB 2 out
headers for a total of four USB to ports
and then a Type C out on top of that now
going over all these details and testing
out everything from the USB speeds to
the neck to the onboard audio to the vrm
leaves us to conclusion time with this
motherboard and what do I think of it
for 269 US dollars well it's coming in
with a solid price point especially when
it comes to the vrm in onboard audio
which I think someone getting a
motherboard for this price will want
those two things and they'll want them
to work extremely well and also doing an
exceptional job of taking both those
boxes
however like I said in the Tai Chi
review you are getting PCIe gen 4 and
you are paying for this generation
around and exactly how many people are
going to be using this verse how many
people going to be paying the premium
for it I'd say there'd be a big
discrepancy there but that aside
everything checks out on this board the
BIOS it's great to see that Oris have
done a good job upgrading that all X 570
board's support precision boost
overdrive - and in the case of the Auris
Pro here it did a fine job of pretty
much finding the sweet spot on the 3900
X so basically if you're not into
overclocking but you want the best
performance out of your rise and 3,000
chip then this motherboard can do that
just like all the other X 570 boards
there for me there was only some very
minor things to critique I'd like to see
a clear CMOS button on the back of the
board as well as possibly a power button
and debug LED light on the bottom of the
board there for 269 USD or 469 ozzie
they have made a board that works and it
works exceptionally well and with that
aside I hope you guys enjoyed today's
review if you did then be sure to hit
that like button and keep in mind this
is for the Wi-Fi version what I'm
pointing with the prices so as for the
non Wi-Fi version I'm told it may not
even be sold in Australia so I'm not
sure there I will update the description
for you guys but also on that note let
us know in the comment section below
what you think of this motherboard what
you think of the Taichi I'm getting the
X 570 motherboard reviews done for you
guys and I hope you're enjoying them
with that aside I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon but on your
way out if you're enjoying the videos
enough sub button ring the bell it's
down there and I'll see you next time
peace out for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
