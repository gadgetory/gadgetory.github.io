a representative for AMD I am going to
get a replacement sample sent over as
the one I had here may be faulty I will
update you guys in about a week's time
as the sample I had here did go through
another channel before it came to me for
a review and with that I will update
again in about a week's time once the
replacement sample comes in I'll do some
thorough testing for it but in terms of
today's video from hearing I'm gonna
leave it as is as there still is a lot
of inconsistencies with the Radeon seven
cards from other youtubers from other
media so hope you guys enjoy the video
so the Radeon seven reviews have been
released and I guess there's just a
flood of videos and articles out there
probably overwhelming and one thing to
come out of it definitely in the comment
section where I was reading up is you
guys are saying the numbers were
inconsistent for instance J's two cents
got hit man numbers that different from
mine but when I watched back his results
it did say hit man and not hit man - in
my defense and also when I looked at say
for instance bit with numbers he got
different results in resident evil we
had the twenty eighty beating the Radeon
seven and look at the hardware on boxes
numbers and he had the Radeon 7 just
crushing the twenty seventy in some of
these benchmarks so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna retest these two cards which
were the main cards in my benchmarks
that I recommended while saying that in
the new market of gravis cards the RT X
2070 is definitely a car that you'd want
to consider especially if you want to
save money against the RT X 2080
and also the Radeon seven but the Radeon
seven it was a decent card
I felt like although it lost in raw
performance against the RT X 2080 it did
make up for that by having sixteen
gigabytes of frame buffer which is a big
advantage over the eight gigabytes the
RT X 2080 has when that's coming in at
$500 but regardless I'm gonna show you
guys how I benchmark as well and I will
say one thing I do agree with Jays two
cents when he says if you're serious
about buying this graphics card then
definitely go check out a heap of
different reviews make an informed
purchasing decision because one thing
I've noticed this is probably one of the
most inconsistent releases where I'm
looking at results in there
over the place now I did test in 21 by 9
1440p which puts more of a strain on the
GPU then 1440p wood or even 1080p and I
don't believe at testing 1080p in this
regards because of the fact that you
could run into a CPU bottleneck since
these graphics cards are quite powerful
now in terms of my test bench I'm using
a 9900 KF 5 gigahertz it's got a custom
water cooler on a Z 390 Taichi with some
vengeance Pro and 16 gigabytes of memory
in dual channel configuration using the
XMP profiles but without a side let's
update the drivers and whack this thing
on the test bench and see if the numbers
change in two of the titles in
particular that I got called out for and
that was hitman 2 as well as battlefield
5
so now just finished testing battlefield
5 and also hitman 2 and then I changed
over to my RT X 2070 and my 2070 numbers
were right on the money hitman 2 was
right on the money with the Radeon 7
with the new drivers and then the
battlefield 5 numbers were actually a
bit off so that sort of plays into that
inconsistency part with all the numbers
and all the reviews you're seeing but to
add further
I guess problems is that this card
doesn't boot anymore and I had this
issue on the first day that I got it and
I emailed AMD and I said look I've got
this problem where it doesn't boot and
they assured me that it wouldn't be a
problem on day 1 release they said
they've identified the issue with PCIe
connectivity and it not booting on
certain motherboards and that'll be
fixed on day 1 and it's now day 1 I've
got my latest driver the public release
driver and it's still doing it so at
this stage I'm very annoyed because yeah
Dean you took my word and then you sort
of I don't know if you lied to me or
whatever but I've still got the problem
and I should have informed my viewers in
that review about it and it really hurts
me personally because my viewers are
everything to me and if I'm gonna leave
something like that out and you promise
me it's a non-issue then it's a
non-issue but it is an issue clearly and
with that I'm going to completely agree
with gamers Nexus this thing is not
ready for launch and it's obviously an
issue that's worse than drivers so I
wouldn't buy this card at the moment I'd
say stay on the fence and I'm gonna
revisit it I don't know when but this
card is just not fit for sale at the
moment and that's my honest opinion with
it and now that's me changing my opinion
now after watching others reviews and
are saying that they're saying there
having problems as well so clearly this
in my opinion is worse than a driver
issue and there's also too many
inconsistent numbers out there with me
experiencing my own inconsistencies with
battlefield 5 and I wanted to go back
and recheck some of the numbers in all
the other games but I can't even boot
the Kart up now you see here it's
running in the background I've tried
different cables I've tried changing to
another graphics card at the same time
booting up the computer and then trying
to change the display port nothing's
happening so there's a bigger issue than
just drivers with this gravis card so
guys watch other reviews out there I've
changed my initial title I've updated
the description and also pinned a
comment in my previous review about
Radeon 7 and I do apologize for letting
you guys down on my day 1 review however
I did only have two days to completely
test the card and it's sometimes it's
just not enough time that I get my
review sample late and I try to do the
best job I could and I thought I did do
the best job in hindsight but obviously
I was led astray by the words in an
email so I'm a little bit pissed off
about that and yeah I mean this is
serious stuff right I mean someone
spending a thousand bucks on a graphics
card or $700 us on a graphics card and
they take my word for it and then they
go buy it and then they come back to me
and say hey it's not working properly
that that to me is a big issue that's
sort of stuff that I hate personally I
hate it when I buy a product off another
person's recommendation and they've
misled me so I don't like misleading my
audience one bit I found out about this
issue now post driver release is not
working I don't think it's the right
thing to do and of course as soon as I
found out about this and the
inconsistencies and also all the other
reviews having inconsistencies as well
I'm letting you guys know now let us
know in the comments what you think
about Radeon 7 and this whole launch
it's actually getting worse and worse
and I'm definitely going to make a
minimum for myself to test cards now and
give myself at least maybe four days
instead of two to go back and
double-check my own numbers run more
tests maybe leave the card on for a day
and then go back and retest some numbers
just to get to the bottom of
and it's funny that the overclocking is
completely broken de Barras saying that
game as Nexus is saying that and pretty
much every other reviewer Linus
detectives as well said they couldn't
overclock the card one bit so that sort
of relates to my overclocks as well
where I just max I could get was a 5%
power limit slider up and that was it
anyway guys this stuff is kind of
stressful I'm just gonna get back to
testing out the jewels Elan rig and
making another use PC as well as just
sort of trying to train up the wild
magpie out on my porch I hope you guys
enjoyed the video if you did hit the
thumbs up button and of course I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon
love reading your comments make sure you
comment on this so I know what you guys
are thinking but yeah this cards just
it's not it's a no-go at the moment and
I'm just updating that and I'll update
it again I'll make another video in
another week or another two weeks or
whatever but this is going to be I think
a bigger issue then I once anticipated
of course it could be a faulty card but
when that many other people are having
issues with the graphics card - then
there's something else going on that's
just my opinion anyway guys peace out
for now bye
