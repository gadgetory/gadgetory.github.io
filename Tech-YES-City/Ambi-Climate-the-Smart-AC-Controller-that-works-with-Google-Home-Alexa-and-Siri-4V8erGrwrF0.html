featured Ambi climate who was seriously
changing the game when it came to aircon
and not only just aircon comfort and
they did this fire a smart system a
control device that you set instead of
having your aircon remote and then you
can control your whole aircon via your
smartphone whether it's iOS or it's
Android however this year they are
innovating even more in that they are
linking it up to Google home and Amazon
Alexa as well as having it hooked up to
Siri so you can just voice activate
whatever comfort profile you want now
the benefits of this of course power
savings but also comfort so you don't
have to worry about going out for a
whole day's work and coming home
especially in a humid climate and things
are just really ridiculously hot where
you are however that aside we're gonna
go over to Julian now who's gonna tell
us a little bit more about this device
and how it's been innovating over the
last couple of years and what it can do
for you so that one of the key concepts
of a me climate is that now you know
comfort is not just about temperature
alone and we nowadays with your remote
control that's pretty much all you can
set but actually you know there are many
other factors that affect human comfort
like humidity or sunlight coming in the
room changing weather outside things
like that and it's not really just a
single factor or it's not just these
practice and isolations that are
important is the combination of these
factors as a brief example you know like
we know for many of our users like in
Hong Kong if we take this to like
temperature and humidity many of our
users are comfortable at 25 degrees
Celsius and about 70% humidity but if
you increase that humidity to say 80%
it's gonna start feeling a bit stuffy or
if you drop it to like 50 percent some
people are gonna start feeling cold all
at the same 25 degrees so the key
concept of a me climate is that we use
AI to kind of monitor and track all of
these factors together and then more in
a holistic way sort of control your air
conditioner to get you comfortable so
another new feature that we have
introduced is the multi user comfort
which is something that we've you know
it's one of the most requested features
for us because after all who lives in
isolation right so you know when you
through this screen here you can
indicate who is in the room and the
system will order
balance your comfort and you can also
visualize what that looks like so let's
say now if we start off with let's say
you know this one particular user here
that user would be feeling a bit warm
but and as you check in other users you
can actually see you know how their
comfort level on average for all the
people in the room would change and you
can you know check-in people not just
through this interface but also by each
user giving feedback through their
account so if you also have like a
Google home speaker you know Google Home
has a voice match so that means that you
know it will actually recognize who is
in the room and then by them giving the
feedback it will also automatically
check them into the room as well so you
know key goal here is to get like
everyone in your family or even in if
it's in your workplace your colleagues
getting everyone comfortable so it's
part of this new feature we also help
you visualize how the comfort profiles
of different users vary so in this case
you can see that for this user their
comfort profile which is sort of green
teal sort of color that is quite
different from the average profile which
is the gray color in the background so
there it is for ambi climate and thank
you for your time Julien it was really
good learning about the new updates and
improvements but if you guys want ambi
climate in your home today and want to
connect it to your smartphone then it's
actually available already on amazon.com
and if you're in australia or other
parts of the world then amazon.com will
ship this item internationally so you'd
have to worry about not having to go
through distribution chains in Australia
but I am told that they will roll it out
to other distribution chains because
already in places like Japan they are
rolling it out in bit camera and
obviously in places like Japan where
humidity is a problem something like
ambi climate where it saves the power
and gets the right temperatures is so
important especially for Japanese
businesses but in the case of me and
doing technology it's very important to
keep humidity down when I'm doing my
temperature tests for you guys that's
one thing we don't talk about here at
Tech SCD a whole lot is that you can
have 25 degrees but if humidity is
really high that's gonna be a hot 25
degrees if humidity is low then it's
gonna be a cool 25 degrees but without a
side hope you guys enjoyed today's video
if you did then be sure to hit that like
button and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon but also big thanks
to Julian and Emmy climate for having us
here today and I'll catch you in the
next one peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
