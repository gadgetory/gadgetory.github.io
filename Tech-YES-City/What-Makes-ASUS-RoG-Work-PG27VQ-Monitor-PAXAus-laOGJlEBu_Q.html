the azuz booth here and we're gonna go
in through with the market share
dominance that a zeus has currently did
for instance in motherboards they're
telling me they got 45 percent market
share so i'm gonna go through here with
jack today how you doing good how's
everything really good i'm lovin packs
so far very spacious lots to do absolute
pleasure with pax Australia you guys if
you aren't seeing it then you actually
missing out but hopefully I'll cover
enough that you wouldn't have regretted
not being here but we're gonna go
through the tough questions here today
with Jack and he's going to go through
with us here today through some of the
motherboards monitors and grammar scales
but well first off we'll start up with
the motherboards what makes this
different to other motherboard
manufacturers out there what's its azusa
side okay first I with the motherboard
for take a smile smart boy is ping well
known for being the most reliable and
most compatible we solar / Bros and key
parts that you can actually plan on the
market
this is many because we have streak
validation process and we also exchange
our paths with all these keep up vendors
to ensure that we post cowork for the
maximum compatibility and we have streak
validation process to ensure that our
products will last well I know I know
sure whether you're actually familiar
with this feature but this is the first
in the world feature to be able to
actually update your bios without a
working environment
no CPU no memory you don't even need to
actually power out the system you
actually use your stable power to after
your BIOS safe and security that means
if you guys buy a new CPU and it's not
even compatible with the motherboard for
instance was not I mean not compatible
in that it doesn't support the new CPUs
you can then update the boss and not
have to go out and buy an older CPU to
update that boss right definitely yes
even if okay even if you actually scared
of BIOS update will actually kill the
motherboard or actually prick the mother
but in anyways USB bass fresh back will
allow you to actually up there to
infinite eyes so that you don't have to
worry about if you fail just redo it so
there you go guys just redo it if you
fail that's really good feature I'm sure
it's gonna save a lot of headaches for
people who are only buying one
motherboard and one CPU
there's also the aura sync lighting you
guys have been pushing that a lot it's
very good if you want to get your whole
system synced up with RGB lighting but
also tell us about the secret sauce
involved with the graphics cards the
streaks graphics guys I love streaks
Kravis cards and they're very
good-looking they've got the RGB
implemented now 2017 I think that's a
must and also they've got the low noise
what's some of the details of how you
get that going
alright the main focus of the Strix
series is not only on the look it's also
on the he sink design okay we actually
have our unique piecing designs to make
sure they actually dissipate the most
heat from your sister from the cooler
and square s square as your fans the
Strix series she come with IP Phi X dust
proof fence so that when you actually
walk when you actually walk wish then
they while she lasts long and they won't
actually quit they were she died outs in
the shop here of time that what you
normally see with old days with old days
plus we actually have a special routing
of the of the hissing so lad Oh most of
the weights will actually be on the
left-hand side of your card and will
actually be supported by this to screw
some on the peg iOS that way you are
she'd be able to prevents the card from
actually sagging that's an awesome
feature now the last part is the
monitors here the ROG monitors they've
hit the market really hard
they've got g-sync now I believe you
guys were some of the first to implement
g-sync
in monitors entirely within video right
that's correct we are the first to
Ashley Cole work with NVIDIA which the
Department of the G sync feature RGB
monitor sound well known to be the best
on the market for the the best of the
class refreshment rates spiked collar
anything you can actually think up that
we actually benefit your gaming expenses
there we go guys there's a little lesson
with azuz and why they're dominating at
the moment with with that dominance
they're also getting into the peripheral
scene so we're gonna take a quick look
at what they're cooking up in terms of
peripherals and what's hitting the
market right now so here I am I am
joined here by Alex how you doing man
yeah good thanks how are you really good
dude I love unpacked so far and what we
got behind me is some new peripherals
here named Li a headset yeah so this is
our new ROG Strix fusion 300
point one surround you can plug this
into your mobile phones your consoles
you know buy a three point five mil or
you'd auxilary and you can also have
plugin through USB so you actually get
the lighting effect on the side of the
the headset itself so it kind of breeze
a red connor color inside the box there
so it comes with Leverkusen and it also
comes with a cloth one so you can
actually change it around kind of like a
DIY kind of headset yeah so what we're
talking about here is customization bit
of RGB adding to the aesthetics of
course I think ROG and the Zeus they
love doing that with headsets but also
right here below me is a new mousepad
coming out very pretty
and what's different about though this
mousepad compared to other mouse pads
well with these ones here it's a
vertical mousepad and probably saw that
you've seen some around with our design
here we're actually done the anti fray
edge stitching so it won't actually
found the edges color-coded as well with
our og shrieks kinda oral kind of
lighting effect but yeah that's that's
pretty much it non-slip base as well so
won't sleep around when you're actually
playing your games all right Alex thanks
for that and we're gonna move around and
check out some more products here the
Zeus booth thanks for your time so now
I'm back here with Jack and we are
looking at a brand new monitor that's
going to hit the shelves from a Zeus do
you want to tell us what makes this
monitor so special even first your
previous models alright so this is
pretty much a new segments okay this is
a new segment for RPG series where we
actually we actually keep you the
privilege to be able to actually have
done Singapore lighting effects with the
rest of your sister this is the very
first get me monitor delay will actually
be able to sync to synchronize these
colors with respect to legit to no
change of colors in so your sis is on
your sister and your peripherals plus
I'll talk about that this is a this is a
perfect curb 37 inch monitor okay we 165
Hertz so what are we looking at with the
r-value of this monitor well this coin
is at 1800 R okay which 165 Hertz
refreshment rate one mini say what
milliseconds great to gray and also is
three sink which precinct and pre
collaborators on their square so you are
looking at
you actually looking at a brilliant
color okay brilliant speed and that at
the right shape for you to actually
immerse more into your games okay so
we're talking a low input lag as well of
course coming out of his loose monitors
and this monitor here actually does look
very good for a TN panel so that's about
it from the azuz booth here today I do
have another video where I'm checking
out their new Z 370 lineup so make sure
you subscribe with notifications on for
that because I'm gonna be asking some
pretty cool questions and also a big
THANK YOU for Jack for coming out today
and showing us the new products and
talking about them and I'll catch you
guys in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
