of cool products some of which I've
already covered here on the channel
ranging from motherboards to graphics
cards and they have five new be 450
motherboards hitting the market this
range is from the B 450 pro 4 and also
the M model
they've also got the B 450 gaming ITX AC
great little budget choice if you want
to do an AMD mini ITX build there's also
the gaming k4 which is for that
particular someone who wants to
overclock but also wants to keep value
in mind this has a 10 phase vrm and also
all these motherboards released from AMD
carry a free store in my license too so
you don't have to go out and pay extra
on that and then we've got the cheapest
model the HDV this is gonna come in and
around MSRP of $60 so you can overclock
on this but of course since it is a
budget model you do still have to be
careful and then that ranges all the way
up to the gaming k4 which is slated to
be around 125 dollars MSRP so asrock are
really covering all bases when it comes
to be 450 motherboards now let's take a
look at what else they've also got on
display
welcome back to tech yes City and if you
guys liked the desk mini then there's a
few new variants being released there's
actually prototypes of a slim version
coming into 2.2 liters and also an X L
version coming in at 3 liters now the XL
version you're probably thinking why do
they need to go bigger they've already
got out in the wild a 2.7 liter version
which features an 8700 or at least
support for an 8700 on a Z 370 and also
a GTX 1080 MX and model but the trick is
they do tell me a rumor that an
eight-core and a Z 390 is going to be
released and something like this
prototype is definitely something that
could support with that extra Headroom
so that it doesn't thermal throttle with
a 95 watt TDP but as for the good old
wait there's more we did take a look
already at the RX 580 phantom gaming now
people did critique this as having no
backplate that was one of the biggest
things that people wanted to see
especially on an Rx 588 gig model now
asrock do assure me they didn't give me
any specific dates that they will be
releasing a revision with a backplate
installed and also on display they had a
lot of these rx5 80s in a mining setup
to new products they're bringing to the
market in terms of mining motherboards
is one on the AMD side the X 370 Pro BTC
plus this aims to use an AMD CPU but
still give you a lot of slots for mining
if you wish to not use a riser cable
though it still has USB support and
molex support to add in additional
risers on top and it is a very long
board beside that is still a long board
but one that is slated towards people
who don't care about the CPU they don't
care about memory and this is the J 34
55 pro BTC plus it already has a CPU
installed that is the G 34 55 and it
uses ddr3 or 3l so dim laptop memory so
you can get away with using a cheap
stick of memory and still be able to
stack a heap of graphics cards in a
mining setup now the good thing about
this display or if bad thing at the
if you're into mining or not was that
all these cards when I put out the
thermal-imaging camera they were all
running extremely cool keep in mind the
case was suited towards mining but it
was good to see these cards were only
hovering up to 50 degrees while they
were mining hardcore earth in terms of
their prices that is yet to be confirmed
by as rock but they do tell me that they
will be coming out towards late July for
both these massive mining motherboards
though speaking of graphics cards as
rock have decided to increase their
current stack and instead of just having
an rx 580 as the top model they now have
a Vega 56 card which will come in at an
MSRP of $500 this includes a phantom
gaming backplate and it does look pretty
cool of course it's going to run very
similar to your Vega 56 reference model
since that is what it is based off of
you know guys that about wraps it up for
what's coming out in the next few months
from as rocked
let me know in the comments section
below and also don't forget to hit that
like button about what you thought was
the coolest product here on display
I definitely like those new Vega cards
coming out especially with that phantom
gaming backplate but also that desk mini
with the GTX 1080 and the support for
the six quartz wolf thread was really
cool too and then you've got the B 450
motherboards which are really kicking it
hard in terms of value for money I don't
know which product I like the best let
me know your thoughts and opinions and
also there is a big rumor about graphics
cards from asrock being able to be sold
in Europe they are working on that
there's no specific dates yet so stay
tuned for that but that will be coming
don't know when exactly but they do tell
me they are working on it anyway guys
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
