market with the MX 300 series SSDs
though is this enough to compete with
some of those aggressive competitors out
there in the market let's find out
welcome back to tech yet City this is
brian coming to you guys today with a
review of crucial MX 300 750 gigabyte
SSD which is currently hitting the
market at around 299 AUD and also you
can pick it up on Amazon over in the
states for around about 180 USD now for
a 750 gigabyte SSD with a Marvell
controller that does represent good
value for money though we still have to
run it through the paces test the
quality of the product and see if it is
indeed worth that money so the product
itself comes in steel casing on a blue
PCB now the steel casings not only for
cosmetics but it also functions as a
cooler for the Marvel controller
situated on the SSD besides that you've
also got SLC caching on this drive also
got data encryption and also power loss
protection as well as a three year
warranty now interestingly enough with
this drive crucial have decided to start
using 3d NAND teals
see now you've got eight individual dies
there each packing 96 gigabytes of
capacity which comes together to give
you 750 gigabytes if you're using 1000
megabytes per gigabyte they're using the
standard 1024 megabytes per gigabyte the
readout and windows actually become
something like 698 gigabytes
though enough of the product let's get
on to the benchmarks themselves in the
first benchmark I'm going to pull up
here is a SSD which is a very intense
benchmark and the MX 300 scored very
consistently across all figures here I
wasn't disappointed in any one figure
but at the same time I have seen faster
performance in the past with this Drive
scoring on average around about thousand
and sixty points and the inputs and
outputs per second we're very pleasing
as well as great to see it they were
pretty much as advertised on the Box
coming in at around about 90 mm max
inputs outputs per second they're moving
on to the next benchmark which is the HD
tune Pro benchmark which I do a massive
file transfer to see how good the write
and read consistencies are across this
drive and I was very pleased to see that
the writes did not drop at any point
below 300 megabytes per second which
means that the Marvell controller is
doing its job and it is a very good
implementation for any SSD out there so
there we have it the MX 300 is a very
solid Drive it's not the best performer
though when we look at the consistency
of the performance
for me when I'm looking at an SSD I do
pay very particular attention to was
very impressive on this drive and that's
partly or actually mostly due to that
Marvel controller so when you get an SSD
one thing that I do look out for
personally is a Marvel control so I'm
very pleased to see that crucial have
gone back and used the Marvel controller
on their SSDs again and this means that
you guys if you buy an SSD like this
you're going to get very consistent
performance and that's what it is about
for me when I'm playing video games or
if I'm doing work I'm always going to
get reliable performance out of my SSD
the one thing about this drive that I
will critique is the endurance rating
now it is rated at 220 terabytes
over the lifetime of the drive and
though you do have a three-year warranty
I would like to see it rated up to five
years especially on the 750 gigabyte
model since a lot of the other
competitors out there even on their
cheaper drives are offering five year
warranties so in conclusion I'm very
pleased that crucial have gone with a
competitive product that uses the
Marvell controller and with that said
I'm going to be recommending this
product today if you guys are out in the
market for an SSD that performs very
consistently it might not be the best
performance you've ever seen from an SSD
but I guarantee you it will be one
consistent workhorse for whether it's
gaming or productivity anyway that's
about it for me today guys if you
enjoyed this video then be sure to hit
that like button if you have any
questions or comments about the MX 300
then be sure to drop a comment comment
section below and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can
also this unit was provided as a review
sample though as you guys know that does
not change my outcome on any products
that I review around the channel and
I'll catch you in another tech videos
very soon he's out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
