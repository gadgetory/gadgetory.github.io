motherboard I just couldn't take my eyes
off the x99s slide + motherboard it
basically it came in as the cheapest
motherboard here in Japan it also came
with more features than I could ever
want from a motherboard this is the
quick review of the x99 slide place
mother board from MSI let's get on with
it
so as you guys may or may not know my
previous motherboard was a z87 g45
gaming motherboard from MSI and I had an
absolutely fantastic experience on it
the onboard audio was good it survived a
lightning strike it overclocked like a
monster
especially at overclock my for 670 K Jen
Hwan has well 2 5 gigs on air that's a
I've actually got a video on that as
well if you wish to sit this however is
a different kettle of fish this is the
x99 platform which is the LGA 2011
socket now this motherboard comes in at
around $250 it features eight DIMM slots
it also features a dual handle on the
cpu so when you're going to install the
CPU you've actually got to install two
kind of crank it down with two levers
which was actually an interesting thing
the motherboard itself it comes pretty
much laid out so clearly and easy to
read even a dummy could install a CPU in
this thing and especially the RAM as
well looking at the features of the
motherboard I couldn't help but be
impressed with every little detail on
this motherboard it features 10 SATA
ports 6 which support raid 0 2 raid 1
raid 5 I believe 2 which support IDE and
AHCA mode and another 2 facade are
Express it also comes onboard with an M
2 SATA Express which is the latest
solder from n2 if you've got one of
those little drives you wish to plug
into your motherboard and be drive free
sort of the big 2.5 or 3.5 inch drive
base then you can do that with this
motherboard also this motherboard
features two heat sinks and also it
looks like it features a 10 plus 5 phase
power design so it does have ample power
for the CPU and now I have been using
this motherboard for quite a look for a
little over a few days now and it
honestly it overclocks my 5820k
very comfortably at around 4 point 4
gigs however personally I did tuned it
down to 4.2 gigs
just as I'm going to be using this 24/7
and I like to take care of my my gear so
looking over to the rear of the
motherboard we can see that MSI have
included and Intel I to 1/8 Gigabit LAN
this is a really good onboard solution
it's actually one of the best and
probably my personal favorite for an
onboard ni C I'm glad they included that
the audio is mediocre at best with the
realtek
eight nine - if it was one thing I would
to critique about this motherboard it
would be the audio personally I could
notice a slight difference between the
realtek 1150 and the realtek of 89 - on
this motherboard compared to my z87 so
continuing on with this motherboard it
features three buttons on the
motherboard itself one is the overclock
genie button if you press that it'll
pretty much lock in an automatic
overclock straight away without you
doing anything I find this to be
personally not my favorite way of
overclocking I love manually tweaking
and getting the best possible overclock
myself however it is good for people who
are just starting with enthusiast tech
and it gives them a great I guess a
great sort of overall understanding of
how their particular CPU will run which
is actually a good thing it also has a
power button reset button which is great
if you're using this as a test bench and
my favorite thing about this is the
clear CMOS or clear the maus out of the
C button which is on the back of the
motherboard and that also lights up blue
and if you click it in the light will
come off it's a very intuitive design I
love it so you actually know when you're
hitting that button and you know that
everything's been reset kudos to MSI for
that that is like literally my favorite
clear CMOS button in the world also
looking a little bit to the right of the
motherboard we see that they've included
a dual BIOS feature with a switch as
well so you can switch between bosses so
if you're flashing your boss and you
come into a bad flash you can switch and
then you can update the router where it
gets reflash that bad boss and you're
back in business really cool I love that
feature especially on an entry-level x99
motherboard so looking at the PCI
Express slots we have four PCI 316 speed
slots and we have two PCI two one speed
slots so if you want to sli this on this
motherboard then this motherboard will
only support up to 3-way SLI and also if
you're on a 5820k then all support it in
16 speed 8 speed for two-way or 16 speed
8 speed 8 speed for 3-way if you're on a
59 30 K then you will get 16 speed and
16 speed on two-way SLI and 16 speed 16
speed 8 speed on 3-way SLI so the other
board also features eight ddr4 quad
channel slots for memory
all the way up to 64 gigabytes of memory
looking at the rear of the motherboard
we have a ps2 port we have two USB to
ports and eight USB 3 ports which all
run off MSI's solid power delivery for
Bitcoin mining technology where it
pretty much supplies a constant voltage
to the USB ports so if you have a
Bitcoin miner you don't have to worry
about your asag miners dropping out so
that's I guess that's a cool feature if
you're a Bitcoin miner looking at the
audio jacks we have five audio jacks and
one extra optical out there the audio
jacks being support from manual 5.1
surround as well as a line in and a mic
in and also a headphone out there
there's also the Intel Ethernet I - one
a Gigabit LAN port there and the clear
CMOS button which I've talked about
before so moving back onto the
motherboard there's also two USB three
outs there's also two USB 2 outs so you
can have an extra eight USB ports on the
front panel or wherever you want to put
them looking at the CPU fan connectors
we have two four pin CPU fan connectors
as well as three system fan connectors
which are four pin as well the also
features a front panel audio out and
also one TPM connector so let's move on
now to the conclusion I'll do a quick
mic test as well you guys can hear if
there's any noise on the ADC coming into
this mic and I'll talk about a few
little different things as well so
here's a quick test on the amp on the
ADC and the ADC itself this is just
using my razor carcast headset a lot of
you guys probably have headsets and
you're gaming so this is on a volume of
50 with the plus 20 decibel feature it
does have the noise suppression as well
so if noises a problem you can just turn
that on however your voice quality will
be affected if you use that setting but
honestly if people can't hear you can
just turn up within decibels and then
you can just put on the noise
suppression but all in all it's not too
bad let's move on now to a conclusion
and I'll talk about some negatives with
this motherboard as well so let's move
on now to a conclusion with the x99s
slide + motherboard and the first
there's only a negative really the only
negative that can point out with this
motherboard is the first PCI Express 16
speed slot is slow close to the second
PCI Express 16 slot
that'll make people with two air-cooling
gtx 97
for example have a bit of heat output
there so they're clumped up so close
together I would have liked to have seen
an extra slot in between these two PCI
Express 16 speed slots but it's not too
much of a problem especially for people
water cooling or people on a 5820k who
can't get 16 speed 16 speed anyway you
can just move the second grabs card down
to the third slot however it is a
problem for someone who got a 59 30 K
and if they get to beast grabs cards in
the future and they want to SLI them
then they want 16 speed 16 speed PCI 3
so that's something that I kind of it is
a bummer with this motherboard I mean
ultimately people getting the x99s
motherboard I believe they will want to
be putting two grams cards in SLI or
most people will be I probably will be
in the future just not at the moment I'm
only using one 1440p monitor but on the
side note the USB 3 slot I would have
liked to have seen them with the USB 2
front panel out ports as well however
they are in a decent position and I do
like the intuitive design that MSI has
brought with this motherboard I mean
they put the all this side up ports are
angled where the graphics cards come
over them also that USB 3 port is angled
as well with it grabs card goes over it
and then the one that's not near the
graphics card is angled up so it doesn't
have a lot of options there a lot of
features and ultimately yeah when I got
this motherboard out of the box I was
surprised at how heavy it was it felt
really good I mean it felt really heavy
it felt solid
it just came feature-packed I was like
wow okay this is actually worth the
money so if you're looking for a
motherboard that's good Bay for money on
the x99 platform if that could be said
good value on x9 then this is certainly
it you're getting just feature packed
motherboard it comes with all these
buttons on board the month the
motherboard as well like a power button
OC Genie button reset button you're also
getting a bias switch button there which
is a really cool impotent implementation
and the best clear CMOS button I've ever
seen in the world so kudos to MSI for
that this motherboard honestly it is
pretty good bang for buck the real tech
alc 819 it's not that bad I mean if
you're an audiophile you're most likely
going to have audiophile grade gear
anyway so that's not even going to be a
problem for the average person like me
who's not an audiophile it really
doesn't matter and the mic in I mean the
Lycans not bad the line
I'm actually recording off it now so you
guys can let me know how it sounded
sounds in the comments below I've tested
it before I think it sounds absolutely
fine other than that the the actual
Intel I to 1/8 V they're on board ni C
is really good for gaming so if you're a
gamer you are going to love the onboard
implementation of the N I see with this
motherboard other than that I mean yeah
it hasn't been proved problematic they
have to update the BIOS with the B clock
strap that is something that's a bit of
a problem at the moment as in the BIOS I
can't find anywhere to unlock the big
clock strap feature so I believe they
will update that in a future boss other
than that the mother wood is a solid
overclocker it meaning overclocks my
5820k
really well the temps minutes at 4.2
gigs at the moment and it's just running
powering along the heat sinks aren't
even getting warm though when I did
overclocked at 4.5 gigahertz at one
point like 3-2 volt or something like
that it was getting pretty hot the heat
sinks were getting pretty borderline hot
so if you're on a 59 6 DX and you want
to go this motherboard just be careful
when you're overclocking that's just a
little caution there other than that
yeah it's just an amazing board I can
highly recommend it to people who is
value minded and they want to jump on
the x99 platform
