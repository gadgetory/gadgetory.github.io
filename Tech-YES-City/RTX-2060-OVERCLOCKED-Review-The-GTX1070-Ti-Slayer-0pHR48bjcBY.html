we have a Nvidia's RTX 2060 graphics card
and I've gotta say this is
going to be my first time
actually hands on with a founder's
edition 2000 series card.
Now, there has been a bit of controversy
surrounding this graphics card.
It came out at $349 and people are saying
it's too expensive compared to
the predecessor the GTX 1060,
and also the one before that, the GTX 960.
Now, my biggest critique before
even going into this review
is that it's got 6GB of VRAM,
when it's stacking up against the GTX 1070
and also the 1070 TI and 1080
and those graphics cards had 8GB of VRAM.
Now, of course it does have
GDDR6 versus 5X on those cards
but that extra frame buffer
on those predecessors
does make it more attractive
especially if you're
playing at 1440p with ultra
textures on in some titles,
it can get pretty demanding.
But regardless we will be
taking a look at that today.
We'll be comparing it against the RTX 2070
and also the GTX 1070 TI hall-of-fame.
This is one of the best 1070
TI's you can get out there
and also another thing
is this will be my first
founder's edition card
for the RTX 2000 series
I've had come through the channel here.
So, we're gonna take it hands on
and see what this card's
all about first, physically,
and then we'll get on to the
numbers when we benchmark it.
(upbeat electronic music)
So, here's the graphics card, right here,
measures in at 23 centimeters long,
it's a dual slot cooler
and weighs in just under one kilogram,
coming in at roughly 975 grams.
It's got a steel
backplate that encompasses
the whole card itself with
two fans on the bottom,
RTX 2060 logo branding, as
well as the back of the card
you get a 8 pin PCIE connector.
And then for inputs and outputs,
I do like what they've done here.
One dual DVI-I link as
well as a USB type-C,
two display ports and
one HDMI 2 connector,
not to mention these cards
from the driver updates now
will support freesync monitors,
which we will be quickly
testing in this review too.
Also, included the box
is a little extra box,
which just has two little manuals in it.
Nothing to get excited about.
Now in terms of this
card, specifically itself,
it's got 1,920 touring cuticles
as well as six gigabytes of GDR 6 VRAM
as we mentioned before.
And it's got 37T of ray
tracing power available.
So, it will support ray
tracing and DLSS features
in certain games that do support it.
With all that aside,
let's whack this thing
on the test bench and see how
well it does indeed perform,
as well as overclock.
(upbeat electronic music)
So, now we just finished
testing out the RTX 2060
through five different
games and also two different
simulated bench marks.
Now, I did manage to overclock
this card, and quite well.
We gotta an extra 170 megahertz
roughly on the core clock
and also 870 megahertz on the memory.
This enabled us, not only
to get those games in those
simulated benchmarks but this
also scaled over very well
to the five different
games that we tested here.
However, before I test the
other graphics cards out
I did manage to test out the fan speeds
and also the temperatures
on this graphics card.
And I'll pull up a
graph here for you guys,
where the sweet spot is
definitely 60% fan speed.
So, if you put this on and
this is, the good news is here
is we actually overclocked
this graphics card for doing
these fan speed and
noise temperature tests.
So, this is pretty much
a worse case scenario
and this is doing extremely well.
This is in a 28 degree
ambient environment.
So, the founder's edition
card for the RTX 2060,
is performing extremely well.
It's gonna be very quiet.
So, you're looking at 42 decibels of noise
and I'm actually sitting
right beside it here now,
it's 60% fan speed.
So, this is what you can expect
gaming all day, everyday,
with an overclock and pretty
bad ambient temperatures.
So, that's the sweet spot for it.
If you leave the fan speeds on auto
and you just want to overclock, the
max you'll see is a 64% fan speed level
and this gets you around 43 decibels
and this will pretty much
hold the same temperatures.
I measured 64 degrees in Unigine Heaven
after about 10 minutes.
And then look here, 80%,
there's a massive jump here,
from 51 decibels up from either 42 or 43
and this enabled us to get
a five degree drop down
to 59 degrees during Unigine Heaven.
Upping this to 100% fan speeds,
we managed to get 55 degrees.
So, this scored 57 decibels.
So, basically, in a nutshell
with the founder's edition card,
the cooler that they've implemented
does a phenomenal job of
cooling, keeping the noise down
and also keeping the temperatures down,
even when it's overclocked.
But, with that aside,
we've still got another
three different graphics cards
here to test and overclock.
So let's get that done for you guys.
(upbeat electronic music)
And here we are now with
all the testing done.
It actually took me a lot longer than
the quick B roll cut that we did,
showing the cards being tested.
But, we've got now for you guys,
normal and overclocked figures
and we'll pull up here
Shadows of The Tomb Raider
because here is where things
actually get very interesting
for the RTX 2060.
It's comfortably beating out the 1070 TI,
the RX 590 is behind but that's
in a different price bracket
and we'll talk about
that in the conclusion
and then we've got the
RTX 2070 pulling ahead.
So, all these cards in this
graph are very important
for the conclusion.
But the interesting thing
here was the overclocks
on the RTX 2060 were performing very well
at both 1080p and 1440p
and it was beating out the 1070 TI
and that was the hall-of-fame edition,
this thing here is an absolute beast.
It overclocks extremely well, getting over
200 megahertz on the core clock
and coming in pretty much
with similar performance
to a 1080 once it's overclocked.
But moving over now to the next
graph, 3DMark Fire Striker.
It's important to look at these results
because here we saw the RTX 2060
only getting around a 10% gain
with the overclocks and 1070
I did score a victory here.
It's probably the only victory it scored
versus the 2060 in today's video.
But we look at also times by
extreme, we can see a 10% gain.
And so, these figures were
a little but weird for me
because I've never seen this,
when I've been testing graphics cards.
And that is that the
overclocked figures in games
were performing better than
they were in synthetics.
And so we go back to
Shadows of The Tomb Raider,
the RTX 2060 performing about 13% better
with the overclock versus the 10%
in the synthetic Fire Strike
and also the times by extreme.
So, it was just a weird thing.
If you guys know why this
is happening with this card
then let us know in the
comment section below.
Maybe, it's got something
to do with the dual cores
just breathing a lot better with GDR6
but I don't really know
the exact reason why
but it's a great thing for gamers
because this cards going
to respond very well,
getting pretty much 1080
levels once you overclock it.
But, moving on now to the next game.
We've got here, Far Cry
5, this is pretty much
an even score between the 1070 TI
and also the RTX 2060,
RX590 and also the RTX
are different fields,
different price leagues.
But, the founder's edition
card, once we overclocked it,
did edge out the 1070 TI both at 1080p
and also at 1440p, so this was
a good result for the 2060.
And moving into the next
game, Rainbow Six Siege,
here straight away we saw
at 1080 p that 2070 was actually starting
to get a little bit CPU bound.
So, it didn't respond
that well to overclocks.
But the 2060 did pull
comfortably ahead of the 1070 TI
which then did pull comfortably
ahead of the RX 590.
So, this was a good game to display,
I guess the flexing of the 2060 over
the hall-of-fame 1070 TI
and both 1080p and 1440p
saw these numbers and this trend.
And move over to Battlefield
5, I saw a similar story
with the 2060, yet again
pulling ahead at stock levels
and also overclocked levels
versus the 1070 TI hall-of-fame.
But, what about the last
game we've got up here
for you guys at 1080p and also 1440p,
this is Hitman 2 and the RTX
2060 is scoring some very good
numbers here, ultra settings.
1440p numbers were also
showing that this graphics card
was scaling very well in
comparison to the 1070 TI,
actually slightly losing.
Which now leads us on to the last graph
and that is the power consumption,
these two graphics cards
here, this was interesting,
the 1070 TI is actually pulling
the lowest power consumption
out of all the 4 cards here tested today.
Coming in at around 250 watts
then 275 watts overclocked.
RTX 2060 is scoring around 300
watts when you overclock it
and about 270 out of the box.
Then the RX 590 actually
scoring around similar levels.
And then the RTX 2070
with its high performance
is also juicing more power,
getting around 350 watts overclocked.
But now we're moving on
to conclusion time here,
with the price and this is
where things get pretty tricky
because I'm going to be
different recommendations
for Australia versus the USA.
If you're in America, $350 US,
it's a decent price,
it's not the best price and
it's not the worst price
I've seen on a graphics card
but it is a decent price
considering that's what you
can get it for on Amazon.com.
Stock is readily available,
not just for the founders
edition card but also for the B partners,
have their cards out.
I'm actually very keen
to try the gigabyte mini
which comes in at 170 mil
length for a special project.
But this card itself, the
founder's edition card,
for the lack of the two gigabytes of VRAM,
it does make up for that big
time with the build quality,
with the thermals and
also those overclocks.
So, if you get one of these
cards you can comfortably
overclock it and not have to worry
about the card getting hot
and also not making much noise at all.
But also on top of that
you are paying extra money
for that silicone which
a lot of people arguably
wouldn't need.
But you do get DLSS
support, ray tracing support
and that is starting to
make its way into games.
Qwate 2 recently got a massive update
full of ray tracing support.
Battlefield 5 is also
starting to play smoother.
But the best thing coming
out of the latest update
and I've tested with this
card, specifically is the
G sync compatibility on the XG35 monitor.
The 1440p ultra-wide 100 hertz from Asus,
this card worked flawlessly
in Battlefield 5,
it was working with that adaptive sync.
So, that is another bonus I guess
that Nvidia have recently thrown in.
Which I honestly thought is long overdue.
But, I'm glad to see that
now you get adaptive sync
on all those good value for money monitors
and it works with Nvidia graphics cards.
So, basically, if you're
in the US at $350,
this card is decent, it
definitely would be the card
that I would buy, personally.
It's the leader in its
performance segment.
It beats out the RX 590 comfortably,
that cost $290 or $280,
currently on Amazon and it even beats out,
will beat out, I believe a
Vega 56, comfortably as well
and that costs more
than this graphics card.
So, the competition do need to step it up
in this performance segment.
As for the 1070 TI, this
thing beats it out comfortably
as well, but it just
has 2 GB of less VRAM.
So, it is a decent buy in
the USA but here's where
we gonna move over to Australia now,
where if you pay $600 Aussie,
I don't think it's simply worth it.
We've put the RTX 2070
in there for a reason
because you can pick one of these up
for a little over $700 Aussie,
which for that extra
price, I believe it offers
better value for money.
And so I would like to
see Nvidia in Australia
at the very least, drop the
card to 500 asking price.
I think that would be
a better starting point
because the AIB partners on static ice,
they're charging around $620 Australian.
Which I feel is just a
little bit over priced
for what you're getting in Australia
and especially when you compare $350 US
converted to Aussie dollars.
It comes well under $600
even if you account for GST.
I know the argument of us living overseas,
it's more expensive for the parts
is a pretty moot point in this case
when the RTX 2070 can be had
for the price that it's at.
So, anyways that was
definitely a weird review.
I've seen the gaming
numbers pull out ahead
with the overclocks versus the synthetics.
We've seen this be a decent
buy in America for 350 US
but in Australia, I'd go for the RTX 2070.

Bye.
But, I've sort of just been
illustrating these cards
the whole review by holding them up
and I'm pretty jet lagged as well.
It's a weird feeling getting
back from the US to Australia.
This jet lag hit me hard, man.
And, I've got this accounting to do
and, anyway, catch you in the next one.
Bye.
