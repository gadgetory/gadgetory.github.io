where are my results well there was a
mixup and I was supposed to be sent a
CPU with my motherboard but that didn't
happen and then there's another source
where I'm getting another CPU
motherboard from and that's delayed as
well so in the meantime I'll have my
results out in the next few days but I
also wanted to talk about what's out
there at the moment and there's some
very solid results already been released
of course and I want to talk about the
coffee lake situation in general the
first thing of course is the scarcity of
these CPUs and it's looking like this is
very true and it's the first time where
I've seen an overclockable I 5 variant
not being released side by side it's Big
Brother the i7 so in this case we have
the 80 600 k not really in stock
anywhere but we've got the i7 8700 k
that's been released and it's been sold
out already however there's also two
CPUs that I really like from this lineup
that's the i5 8400 and also the i7 8700
K however that first problem the
scarcity this could be a double-edged
sword for Intel we're in that if they
don't have the supplies available that
unimaginable Ike well I'm not gonna buy
a cabbie like CPU because the coffee
like the new CPUs a much better value
for money and so if they can't buy a
coffee like CPU then this may in fact
drive sales towards Rison which is
currently in supply stocks are really
good and also the value for money is
really good so the second problem I
wanted to talk about before we talk
about the CPUs themselves is the fact
that they've only released one
motherboard and that's a Z 370 lineup
and they haven't released the cheaper
variants like the beef 360 or the
cheaper H variants and this spells a
little bit of a problem especially for
people getting into PC gaming and they
want good value for money and they want
to buy that I 580 400 which is easily
looking like it's really good value for
money and may end up being the best CPU
and the coffee like line up I just have
to test the numbers I can't wait to do
that but if they can't couple that with
the chief of motherboard like you count
risin for instance you can get a risin 5
1600 a be 350 motherboard if you can't
do that on the Intel lineup then this
could score problems for Intel
especially in the next
months so these cheaper motherboards are
rumored to come out in the next three
months however in the meantime you can
only buy an i-5 8400 and a Z 370
motherboard which is kind of pointless
if you don't want to overclock and you
have no intentions of overclocking then
you can save some money and especially
if you're buying an 8400 it's an on
overclockable cpu so those two points
aside though let's talk about the i-5
8400 first this is looking like it's my
favorite CPU of the lineup as its going
to be bringing some strict competition
to the horizon 5 1600 which is a v6 core
12 threaded variant and this was easily
my favorite CPU of the whole Verizon
lineup it was just the balanced King
it's so relevant in 2017 it's so good
for productivity for people on a budget
it's also really good for gaming and so
the i5 8400 in ways spells competition
to this Rison v 1600 variant it's really
good value for money getting sick cause
6 threads but you're also getting that
better IPC from Intel's lineup
however with clock speeds are gonna be
checking this out doing a lot of gaming
benchmarks and seeing how it stacks up
against the horizon 5 1600 both stock
and overclock and I believe this will be
a very good comparison for you guys but
in the meantime with the scarcity of
coffee like CPUs and if you wanted to
build a new piece in you wanted to go
the Intel route then I'd probably
recommend buying the CPU now the 8400 so
it doesn't get sold out later on holding
on to it and then waiting for a chief of
motherboard if you want some of the best
value for money and you want to go with
that Intel option so the next thing I
wanted to talk about was the i7 8700 K
this is definitely going to be a
competitive CPU in the market for people
looking for that productivity CPU but
also something that it will be easily
the gaming king it has the IPC the same
as the 7700 K but in a lot of ways it is
looking like it is overclocking a bit
higher on average I've heard of a lot of
people already getting 5.2 gigahertz and
even without D letting so I can't wait
to get mine deal it at see how high can
overclock it and also on that note I
believe this CPU is gonna be
cannibalizing Intel's
own higher-end
cpu's I can't imagine anyone going out
and buying a 7800 X or a 78 20x now that
the coffee lake 8700 K is released and
in way as the 7900 X is also a big ask
as well if you need those extra PCIe
lands and you want to go Intel then that
CPU is a lot more expensive over $700
more expensive than the coffee lake
variant and it doesn't perform a whole
lot better and in some ways it won't
perform as good even in productivity
where some applications are still single
and not multi-threaded supported like
for instance Adobe Audition
if you want to edit audio that's still
or noise removal for example that's
still single thread independent so in
ways the 8700 K won't just be the gaming
king it may in some ways be the
productivity king for some people with
some applications however on that note
even though it's cannibalizing intel's
own line up it will be a very
competitive cpu we've already seen the
numbers coming out with the Cinebench
scores people are getting around 1600 if
they overclock a high enough they get
near 1700 points this is coming into the
horizon 7 1800 X territory when it's
overclocked and risin 7 the 8 core
variant was indeed AMD's balance King in
my opinion it did gaming very well and
it also does streaming and productivity
very well and it is a lot cheaper than
the horizon thread Ripper CPUs and it
also does gaming better than the risin
thread ripper sea views on the run
thread versus abusive warning at the
same performance you have to disable
your cause which I did disagree with
doing on the X 399 line up so 2017 is
stacking up to be one of the best years
in tech history for the consumers we're
all winning here when competition comes
around we're all gonna be definitely
loving the value for money we're getting
risin 5 1600 now we've got the Intel
coffee like response and they are pretty
good value for money as well however
they do have some problems which of
outlined in today's video and how this
is gonna spell in the next three months
is anyone's guess I do think it will be
a little bit of a problem especially if
people wanting to get on the Intel
lineup and if they can't get the CPUs I
mean for instance they're already sold
out in Australia and these supplies are
reported to be very limited so whether
this actually drives more sales
towards Verizon as well remains to be
seen or whether people are that patient
and they're going to wait until
suppliers come back in or if people want
to get for instance the i3 8100 Intel's
budget for core which actually looks
like it's coming in at a very good price
as well and wait for a very cheap $50
motherboard from Intel remains to be
seen so anyway guys I hope you enjoyed
my thoughts and opinions video today on
coffee like if you did then be sure to
give it a big thumbs up if you have any
questions or comments and be sure to
drop a comma in the comment section
below I mean what do you guys think of
the new coffee late release I mean I
think it's a great thing for consumers
but in the other hand if the supplies
are very limited yeah this could be a
double-edged sword for Intel remains to
be seen what's going to play out but I
love reading your comments as always and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
