month and I'm running out of coolers so
I've got to use an Aliexpress $25 cooler
and I'm running out of power supplies
too this is the last ten dollar budget
power supply that I have on hand and
with that I've got to get a new hard
drive to ran out of hard drives but we
do have an x58 motherboard this is the
Zeus X 58 de motherboard absolutely
amazing really good vrm I just love this
thing and it's already pretty clean - so
we're gonna have to give that a cleanse
but what we will have to do with it is
take off the Northbridge heatsink
because they usually get pretty bad
after a while and that can affect
performance of these motherboards and
overclocking though the graphics card
that is dirty so that will be getting a
cleanse and let's take a look at the
prices that we paid for all this gear
now some of it I did get donated for
free but I will press it up on current
market prices on what you could go and
buy it for so we've got ddr3 memory 12
gigabyte kit and get this for around 60
USD 1 terabyte hard drive 45 USD X 56 70
41 USD motherboard and x58 motherboard
pick this up the $60 and then the gratis
card the GTX 780 we've got this for a
hundred and seventeen dollars in a used
parts on that cooler of course $25 as I
said in the intro and the power splay
ten dollars and the last piece of the
puzzle you probably saw the thumbnail
we've ran out of cases too so we had to
chop up an old Dell case hence the term
for this build is called bottoms up now
with all that aside let's build
ourselves a 350 eight dollar gaming PC
or if you're in Australia of 457 AUD
gaming PC
welcome back to tag yes city so you're
probably wondering what is going on with
this build here and we've got a full
sized ATX
x58 motherboard now this is all I've got
in stock I don't have any micro ATX
boards on hand and we've got a micro ATX
case and it's a Sunday so I can't go out
and buy a case either and honestly this
is the whole thing this is what the
channel is about is making something
unique so what we've done here is we've
grind it off the bottom of this case and
then pretty much stuck it bottoms up and
hence the name for today's build but now
it's time to put this thing together
so we just finished bottoms up now and
you guys are probably wondering what
exactly is this abomination right here
and this is a do whatever it takes to
get the best price performance and also
the best overclocks on a budget so let's
tune this thing and see how hard she can
go
so what we could see in those benchmarks
was phenomenal performance I was really
blown away by how good the Zeeland is
holding up in 2017 now granted I did
overclock it to 4.3 gigahertz but that
is why I generally like to choose the X
5670 variant over the X 5650 doesn't put
as much of a strain on your motherboard
does give you a bit of flexibility
especially with that multiplier and then
of course that $25 Aliexpress cooler I
think I'll have to make a dedicated
video on this thing it blew me away I
couldn't believe that I was getting 4.3
gigahertz with a 25-dollar air cooler
off Aliexpress so actually both the CPU
and the cooler you can buy them at any
time so these aren't really deals that I
get off deal hunting they're just deals
you can get off Aliexpress so I'll put
the links in the description below if
you want to check them out it was for
the other parts of course the
motherboard is what makes this build
complete we picked that up for 60 USD
not generally is a really good deal on
an x58 motherboard but keep in mind when
I searched on gumtree for example I
found a $80 X 58 board with a cooler
included that's an extremely good deal
it even had an i7 920 included so you
get that board by that zero and off
Aliexpress and you could have happy days
like I've got right beside me however
the graphics card pretty decent deal for
a GTX 780 my viewers on Twitter have
told me that they got better deals on
Twitter with a GTX 780 however this is
the GHz Edition and it did go very hard
out of the box it overclocked quite high
and that Power Man power supply I was
shocked that thing powered this build
absolutely fine gtx 780 overclocked x50
670 overclocked they even the memory was
overclocked as well and now with the
memory this is what makes x58 so
impressive triple channel memory back in
the day people said it was kind of
pointless it was useless but
fast-forward 9 or 10 years and now
triple channel memory especially on this
PC is so much more relevant especially
if you want to use this thing for
competitive gaming on a budget and
that's where this PC really shines we
can see in those benchmarks
what we were getting was phenomenal
performance I mean I did drop the
settings to stress the CPU a little bit
more and I will be doing an upcoming
comparison comparing this to an r5 1600
and also the brand new 8400 so stay
tuned for that but what we saw in DotA 2
for example was something that could get
near 200 FPS most the times now I did
drop the gravity settings down to medium
and then put them back up to high which
did stress the GTX 780 but the
performance but dota 2 was incredible
csgo of course here was a game that was
doing really well - nowhere near as good
as the new coffee-like variants and I
think the rise in CPU will even beat it
in this game but seriously for a $40.00
CPU and hardware they sold it was
kicking it getting near 300 FPS most the
time walls playing this game now granted
in the comparison I will be using a GTX
1080 Ti to remove any GPU bottlenecks
but moving on to another title we had
pub G very popular at the moment this
thing on very low settings at 1080p was
kicking at so hard all surprises going
over a hundred fps a lot of the times
and this is just where this Xeon really
starts to shine and we look at that
Cinebench score I recently did my
comparison with the new copy Lake CPUs
versus the 1800 X and the 8400 scored
around the similar Cinebench score this
actually be the Cinebench score I was
getting on the 8400 so again this CPU
represents phenomenal value on a $25
cooler as well I know people are gonna
be like look you need a water cooler to
overclock this thing no you don't this
cooler is extremely good and I'm
probably giving it a dedicated video of
its own because it's just that damn good
for the money
but on that note if you're looking for
something to play the new car mechanic
simulator this PC did an extremely good
job again playing 1080p decent settings
will get in good frame rates really
solid experience I was actually
surprised because the car mechanic
simulator does require some decent
hardware to run so car mechanic
simulator 2018 was no problems for this
PC though two other titles I wanted to
take a quick look at overwatch again
1080p this thing just absolutely
destroyed those frame rates really
shocked at what we were getting and also
when it came to Far Cry primal one
benchmark that's actually raised
curiosity a lot lately because of how it
is and how
spawns with the lower latencies on CPUs
this thing scored in a hundred FPS at
1080p they keep in mind I did test it
with the GTX 780 though what we got in
tandem was something that's cheaper than
a brand new coffee like CPU which is out
of stock everywhere and you can't even
buy it and this thing came in cheaper
and this is a whole PC so if you guys
are into PC gaming on a budget and
you're looking for the enthusiast option
this is what you can do if you're on a
strict budget now keep in mind I did use
a brand new Hydra I did price up ddr3
memory on what you could get it off on
Amazon so a lot of the deals here aren't
really deals that I hunt for from
month-to-month so I probably could get
this thing even cheaper if I was really
hunting for some good deals though what
you're looking at with a machine like
this you could probably price it between
300 USD to 400 USD and honestly nothing
that's brand new will beat this thing in
terms of price performance it just won't
happen you've got such good power on the
CPU and the GPU and keep in mind the
power supply is still decent anything
from a reputable brand with decent
voltage on the 12 volt line is going to
do you pretty well keep in mind there
are some bad power supplies out there
however so I will put a list in the
description below
generally the Tom's Hardware list of
power supplies is a good guide to go by
also before I get on out of here yes
this is the enthusiast option if you're
into tuning PC parts and building your
own thing and of course hacking up a
case slightly like this is going to be
awesome
however of course if you're not into
that you just want something more simple
but you want really good price
performance then you can pick up those
HP's those deals and then just drop
something like a gtx 1050 or a GT 1030
in there and you'll be having a decent
experience something like this really
represents my passion it's what I'm all
about
I just love the look of this thing even
though it looks hideous it's got this
power button right up the top here as
well so I don't even need the power
button from this Dell case to turn this
thing on and of course since it's open
air it does actually a really good job
on cooling since the graphics card and
the CPU both have an adequate amount of
fans installed and of course the RPM is
pretty high so anything I had to
critique about this build though I would
say it's a little bit noisy the
aliexpress cooler and it was a little
bit difficult to install but of course
the perform
for that 25 bucks is insane also I did
make one massive mistake with this bill
if you guys are watching up until now
and you haven't noticed then I will say
it because I don't want you guys to
repeat this mistake essentially when I
was installing the motherboard in this
case the two bottom mounts for the micro
ATX motherboard were actually touching
the motherboard which is a full-size ATX
case and that can cause shorting so
initially I couldn't boot the PC and I
did have to update the boss anyway but
it's something that I noticed as well
and so how I managed to fix this was put
some electrical tape and then a bit of
cardboard and then some more electrical
tape in between and of course the
motherboard is working fine though I
could have had a damaged and busted
motherboard on my hands so something
that I did want to tell you guys about
and just warn you if you do want to hack
up cases like I'm doing just be careful
of that that was one thing I just
completely forgot about it blew over my
mind because I've never really dealt
with a full sized ATX board cutting up a
micro ATX board before I have cut up a
mini ITX case and put a micro ATX board
in and that was absolutely fine that was
the dank box I really loved that PC you
guys loved it as well and this kind of
is like the bigger version of the dank
box not only is a bigger in size it's
also more powerful - anyway guys with
that said I hope you enjoyed today's
video if you did then be sure to hit
that like button and let me know in the

drop on the channel anyway guys I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
