Oh begun the guns welcome back to tech
yes it is a bank i'm about you yesterday
with some gameplay footage and also a
review of Call of Duty advanced warfare
now going to be comparing this game to
black ops 2 the pc version as i believe
these two are the most viable sort of
Call of Duty's to play on the pc at the
moment I won't be comparing it to ghosts
as I believe ghost was just one big fail
especially for the PC I mean it started
like crazy when they first released it I
just thought they would have fixed these
problems naturally so late I gave it
unfortunately I gave it a good review I
should have gave it a bad review but
they just abandoned the game did not
update it the game still stutters to
this day so for what it's worth I'm not
going to be throwing in any comparisons
to call of duty black ops or it goes as
I don't believe that's a worthy purchase
if you're on the pc however call of duty
black ops 2 that was a very enjoyable
game so I will be comparing it to call
of duty advanced warfare but first off
let's start off with a few basic things
i purchased this game for 45 australian
dollars very good purchase for that
price the game does not start up the
multiplayer is enjoyable and ultimately
it is a different experience to what
black ops 2 is on the pc so let's start
off by saying the game is essentially
different to call of duty black ops 2
they can't really directly compare them
mainly because this game has new
abilities as you can see here I'm just
dashing forward and dashing back and
that essentially makes it a lot harder
in my opinion to aim in this game I mean
since people are dashing forward all
over the place it's called EXO abilities
anyway it makes it harder to aim and so
I believe this is more of a run-and-gun
type game where you'll find yourself
especially using a Kimbo weapons that's
weapons where you don't aim down the
site more so than you ever did in black
ops 2callofduty so this game I mean
ultimately I'm loving it is a good
experience it is smooth as you can see
here the gameplay is actually really
smooth in multiplayer so they've done a
good job of making the game
smooth the guns I mean I'd have to give
them about the same rating as black ops
2 they feel like they've just
essentially copied some of the guns and
just changed the names for instance this
a k-12 bleeder it feels a lot like the
scar-h does in black ops 2 and i love
that gun in black ops 2 so essentially
i'm using it in this gameplay but you
can see it like the guns that are pretty
bad but they're pretty balanced the
sounds are pretty distinguishable except
in my opinion the silenced guns in black
ops 2 sounded better than the silence
guns in call of duty advanced warfare I
mean in this game all the silence guns
kind of sound the same so let's talk
about some kill streaks in Call of Duty
advanced warfare now they've got a whole
different subset of kill streaks in this
game now it is sort of not kill streaks
though it is based on the black ops 2
system of score streaks where you get
points for whatever your objectives are
especially in team domination and so the
more points you get you are able to get
essentially a score streak so it works
kind of like black ops 2 does except the
streaks are a little bit different
especially as you go towards the higher
end of the spectrum there personally i
do think these score streaks in Call of
Duty advanced warfare are not as fun as
they are in black ops 2 especially the
higher end where you've got the a lot of
passive skill streaks there so your
score streaks sorry and they're a lot
more fun I just think I like to roll
around with passive scorestreaks as
opposed to actives even though the
actives are fun to roll around with I do
prefer playing this game and just quick
just keep running and gunning people
it's essentially the style that I like
so in a nutshell the score streaks are
pretty good I do prefer though these
score streaks in black ops 2 so let's
quickly talk about the maps and the
spawns and one thing I will get out of
the way first is the spawns they are
absolutely crazy in this game I think it
kind of needs to be fixed in that people
just literally spawn all over the map so
that's one crazy thing about this game
so if you're playing it just be keep
your ears I mean you will want to sound
whore in this game and by that I mean
turn up the sound and here with
footsteps are and essentially that will
allow you to get a higher kill streaks
in my opinion but let's put weather maps
quickly the maps are entirely new
especially commander the other call of
duty's there are a lot of fun they give
way to
lot of run-and-gun style matchups I
think in my opinion I mean if you want
to go with a rifle like I'm doing then
you kind of will want to stay at a
distance so this map is one of those
maps that can be favored towards staying
at a distance as you can see here I'm
trying to like stay in open spaces
because a lot of people roll akimbo
weapons and when they do that you'll
want to roll a rifle especially on this
map so it's up to you guys you can roll
this so many different things you can do
but the maps for what it's worth they're
very good they've got a lot of in closed
doors to get a lot of open spaces
they're dynamic as well in that
sometimes the map will change halfway
through the game was all which is also a
lot of fun that gives rise to a lot of
camping strategies though but all in all
the games a lot of fun i can highly
recommend it to you guys especially if
you just want him looking for a fun time
I mean the pc player base is obviously
not as big as it is on the console so if
you're looking to I guess play against a
lot of people especially a lot of
different modes I mean on PC think team
domination and team deathmatch up only
the only two modes that are pretty much
only people play so I'd like to see a
bigger player base on the pc before it's
worth if you're serious about playing
this game and this is your life then you
want might want to get it on ps4 I think
that's the way to roll with a call of
duty advanced warfare but it's a lot of
fun I do like this game and so i can
highly recommend it to people just
looking for a fight a lot of fun the
campaign's a bit of fun as well if
you're looking to play that that'll sort
of teach you the ins and outs as for the
EXO abilities i personally love XO mute
especially in the asian service where
people sound hall XO mutes my favorite
XO cloaks also worthy of a pretty good
mention as well especially if you're
using a rifle the others i don't really
like too much especially like XO stem
for example takes time to activate it so
in a battle you're kind of like not
using it properly anyway but anyway guys
if you enjoyed this gameplay and this
review kind of sort of commentary about
advanced warfare and please give it a
thumbs up and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon anyway
peace out for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
