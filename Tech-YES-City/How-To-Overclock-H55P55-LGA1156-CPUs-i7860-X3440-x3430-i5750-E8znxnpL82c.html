gentlemen right here on the desk we've
got a p55 motherboard it's even got an
i7 860 processor which is worse than the
Zeon's
and today we're gonna be overclocking it
I'm gonna be taking you guys through a
step-by-step tutorial on how you can
extract the most value out of these CPUs
now the Aliexpress Zeon's the X 34 40 s
they're a really good play in terms of
value for money there's the X 30 for 30s
all that will apply in today's tutorial
if you're buying a cheap P 55 or H 55
motherboard now you can also deal it
these CPUs as well if you want to use a
little bit of liquid metal to get even
better temps and possibly more
performance but with that aside let's
start clocking this thing to kingdom
come
welcome back to take your city and here
we have on the desktop first things
first my two favorite programs for
overclocking Cinebench and also I 264
and get a gist trial without a 64 for 30
days
links in the description Bloods all you
need to overclock so you'd have to go
out and buy a license it's a really good
program and this here Cinebench it's a
good program for getting just
performance numbers making sure the
final overclock is giving you those
numbers that you want
so after you've downloaded both these we
just hit restart and then we hit that
delete or f2 depends on your motherboard
I usually just hit them both at the same
time and we need to get into the BIOS so
now in the boss I'm going to be up in
the top right hand corner here guiding
y'all through this process and we've got
to go into a motherboard intelligent
weak and now if you're in a zoo or msi
boss it might look a little bit
different or a naturopath but generally
there's gonna be all the same settings
there and we're gonna go through all
them so this is a gigabyte boss and we
just have to go to motherboard
intelligent Tweaker and then from here
we click the down arrow on the arrow
keys and then we go to advanced
frequency settings and click enter
now overclocking is best done on a full
104 keyboard with a numpad it's just
easier to do that with your right hand
so we've got here the i7 960 now before
we get into this over long tutorials
important to point out the differences I
7 960 is not I'm sorry 860 is not as
efficient as the xeon a xeon shield will
generally get to a higher overclock on
lower voltages because it's a better bin
so basically what that means is if
you've got a 0 on a file express the
next 34 40 or something then you can
copy my settings and you should be okay
but what we've got here on this i 7 860
though is an extra multiplier cuz you
can see here it goes up to 22 but the
x34 40 being so popular has a multiplier
of 20 max so that's what we're gonna use
here today and now there's some pretty
crazy inverse features we'd have to
worry about these here the
whose tech generally works absolutely
fine in my experience this one here at
c3 c6 state I actually like to turn it
off because I only really use c1e which
I like to keep on that just clocks it
down to that state when it's not being
utilized so if you go afk it's quickly
down clocking your CPU this is the one
you want to keep enabled but going back
here qpi clock ratio I like to keep this
on 32 as opposed to 36 that just gives
us a little bit more head room when
we're overclocking on the B clock which
is just down here we can see here B
clock we click enter and then click
enabled and now we can unlock this
magical setting here now
generally most I found most people so if
we hit 190 on our numpad we can enter
most people will be able to get to 190
megahertz here you should be able to get
to 200 though we'll talk a little bit
about that later because it does involve
increasing a certain voltage and this is
the one thing about this platform that's
different to x58
and this is why I don't like this
platform as much as X 58 that's because
you can see this uncor ratio here in the
middle is just shadowed you can't
control it and I believe it's the reason
why a lot of over clocks just get
unstable especially past 3.5 gigahertz
the young core is pretty much a hit and
miss you'll see some guys like in their
overclocking shooter's locking in 200
here and they're like yo anyone can get
this but really this uncor ratio you see
there it just changes the 3.6 gigahertz
it becomes unstable on some CPUs 190 and
a higher multiply for example will get
you to 4 gigahertz and you won't have to
pump as much voltage through the qpi
voltage which is what we'll get onto
later but for what it's worth we'll
leave that at 20 because we don't for a
3.8 gigahertz overclock initially at 190
and now let's go down a system memory
multiply here hit enter and hit 6 now
we're gonna be putting this on the
lowest setting first we don't want to
mess with memory until we've found how
high our CPU can go always an important
thing I always recommend doing this so
once we set those settings we can hit
Gate key go back a notch and then go
down to advanced memory settings because
on this board for some reason it changes
the timings automatically so we go down
to D Ram timing selectable hit enter and
then we just go to quick quick and dirty
that's how generally a lot of people
like it nowadays and we go down to
channel eight timing settings hit enter
again and we're just gonna bang in 10 10
10 and 30 pretty generic timings here
and also a command rate of 2 just to
keep things safe again we don't want
memory to be a factor affecting our over
clocks we know it's one less thing to
worry about when we're overclocking our
CPU so we hit escape a hit escape again
get back to this advanced voltage
setting this is important this one
really important you'll hit enter now we
go here load line calibration I
generally like to enable this I've never
had a problem with it enabled disabled
though could be causing some issues it
could be V droop and very hard
that's essentially when you like put
your foot on the throttle and you got
that initial gap time probably maybe if
you watch the x58 tutorial may have
heard me talk about this now this is an
i7 860 again it's not as good as a Xeon
it's gonna need close to like literally
close to 1.4 volt to keep this
overclocked stable at 4 gigahertz so if
you're on a zero and you might want to
just go to 1.3 5 volt you should be ok
especially with load line calibration
enabled but I'm just gonna go for a
little bit more because I'm on an i7 860
now qpi voltage at 190 you're going to
want close to 1.3 you just might want to
set this to 1.3 and walk away if you're
going for 200 megahertz on the base
clock we'll get to that later you might
want to even go similar to your CPU v
core 1.35 or 1.37 keep in mind the
higher this setting goes as you see here
it's in purple because it's getting
dangerous one point one point sorry the
time and I mean one point two seven
should be okay but we will just give it
a little bit more around 1.3 just to
make sure cuz again I 7 860 not a Z on
these voltages will need a little bit
more because it's not as good as a pin
as that
Zeon chips Oh seal means that platform
chips at hub we'd have to worry about
that again it's like your input/output
your USBs and stuff like that CPU PLL
important setting as well especially
since we're going for a bit more on the
CPU here want to give this 1.86 if
you're going for four gigahertz you may
have to want to give this one point nine
one point eight the one point eight six
should be fine and then D round voltage
one point five and we're gonna be good
to go so now we've got our voltage is
set in one ninety be o'clock means that
we have to up this if you're going down
to like one eighty you should be okay
around these settings one point two one
should be okay one point two three other
because we go on to one ninety we should
need about one point three and we don't
have one point three exactly so we're
gonna go a little bit more and let's
just try lock this in and see if we can
get so xscape escape and then we just
save exit and hit enter and then we
should be going to windows so now we've
made it into the Windows boot screen
absolutely fine and again we did give
these voltages a little bit more that we
probably should have but that's because
it's an overclocked retour and I know
there's going to be people copying my
settings here so we're gonna open up I
to 64 here left double click this open
it up click yes and we're gonna go for a
stress test here and once we stress test
this out we should be okay so tools left
click tools I 264 CPU bring that up it's
gonna tell us our voltages we had a
stability test
no one's gonna hit start all these
selected very real world and we're gonna
leave that going for 10 minutes and if
it passes then we don't need to do
anything more if it crashes then we're
good to go back into the boss and do a
little bit of troubleshooting again
so now it's 10 minutes and it's finished
it's past the stress test it is all good
we're gonna quickly run a Cinebench
score just to make sure the results are
lining up off the top of my memory we
should be getting around of close to 600
points and the score there is right on
the money so let's restart and get back
into that BIOS so here we are back again
we're gonna hit enter and go to advanced
frequency settings so now we're here
we're looking for a two hundred base
clock overclock so press two hundred on
our numpad or we can press + or - it's
up to you and this is essentially like
we seen here we're gonna get four
gigahertz but as I said before that
problem of that Ankur frequency some
people may not be just able to get here
no matter how much voltage they pumped
into their gear whether it be cooling is
this whether they have an air cooler or
a water cooler I just find sometimes you
just don't get to this 200 megahertz
it's just my experience and again I
believe it's because this shadow setting
here that we can't touch is affecting
our performance memory we're never
worried about that yet because we want
to get to the four gigahertz and I want
to show you what's important so we go
down to the voltage settings here and
the CPU should be fine I mean I eat I
Jack this voltage up to one point 375
with load line calibration usually
that's absolutely fine for a four
gigahertz overclock usually you can do
it at one point three five four four
gigahertz but because it's an i7 860
it's like literally the worst bin of the
full koi rated CPUs so we're going to go
I'll leave that at one point three seven
five and we should be good at four key
goods but this sitting here this is a
very important one so if you've got that
higher multiplier you'll be able to
leave this for instance you'll be able
to go with the 180 and leave this at one
point two and go for like a four point
you know whatever four point one four
gigahertz overclock with higher honor
x34 seventy for example but because
we've got this CPU at 200 megahertz base
clock on the motherboard we literally
need to go around
point three five volt possibly one point
three seven or if you CPUs a lot better
it's a Xeon it may get there one point
three one Wow round one point three ish
but we're gonna go for one point three
five here just to test the waters and
we're gonna save that so they're the two
there are two very important voltages
here so don't forget that
QPR vtt actually relates to the base
clock over Club itself because you're
overclocking morph variables in here
like qpi I believe encore is tied to
that even though it's a shadow voltage
and uncor just caps out to so once we're
ready there we're gonna save and exit
get back into Windows and see if this
passes the stress test alright so here
we are back in the BIOS and we're gonna
get back into em be intelligent Tweaker
MIT go down to advanced frequency
settings and here we're just trying to
tweak the memory a little bit now I've
got some real mediocre memory I'm gonna
change this here so click enter on the
memory multiplier go down to eight hit
enter again and now we're at 1600
megahertz we can see that it's shadowed
in and this should be okay we should be
able to achieve this but again we're
gonna click escape and go back into
advanced memory settings click enter and
go down to here
DRAM timing and make sure that's on
quick like we did before and then go to
just channel eight timings and we should
be okay with these timings 10 10 10 and
30 is pretty generous now if you want to
overclock memory guys you can change
this to 1 you can change this to 9 10 10
10 28 for example and you can go from
here memory overclocking takes a little
bit of time to perfectly get right but
we're gonna go for 1600 megahertz now if
you've got the right memory you can even
up this to 10 and get it to 2,000
megahertz but we're just gonna go for
1600 megahertz and 4 gigahertz on the
CPU
and that is a very solid overclock if it
works which it should I've haven't had
much memory not go to 1600 meters and
now here we are on the desktop and
basically with memory overclocking if
you get to the desktop you're really
close or you've either made it most the
time you've made it the overclock should
be fine memories usually cut and dry and
we can just load up I 264 again because
there's a specific benchmark we can use
to test the memory itself so back in the
system stability test we can just
uncheck these boxes here and just go to
stress memory now you can leave this on
for ten minutes but again it should be
okay because it did boot into Windows
absolutely fine and with that said that
pretty much wraps up today's
overclocking tutorial now with these
CPUs they they top out at about 4
gigahertz after that you need
significantly more voltage so what we
can do here today is we can try quickly
before we close out the video just going
for a 4.2 gigahertz overclock but as I
mentioned before if you're having
trouble with stability you can drop a
comment in the comment section below or
join our discord server there's a lot of
cool people there that will help you out
a really good community also if you
enjoyed this one then be sure to hit
that like button and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon also if you
want to get an ex 3440 or a age 55
motherboard I'll put some links in the
description below for you guys and also
the links for Cinebench and I 264 now
basically with the p55 also and the age
55 motherboards and the Zeon's it all
comes down to your gear as well if
you've got a really bad power supply
that can affect your overclocks
especially if it's a super cheap budget
one it has a lot of ripple that can be
up to a hundred millivolts and in really
bizarre cases so that could affect your
overclocks also your cooling as well you
always want to get a decent cooler I'll
Express have like a $30 cooler that you
can use from different CPU to
motherboard and get really good value
it's a twin tower cool it does
exceptional performance in terms of
dealing you don't have to deal it but
it's always a better thing to deal with
to get those temperatures down and also
if your motherboard has no vrm cooling
you can always just get some really
cheap heat sinks
and put a fan on those heat sinks as
well especially if your ambient
temperatures are pretty hot
my ambient temperatures here today we're
about 22 degrees and now with the cpu's
we didn't even go anywhere near 70
degrees like we were staying under 70
degrees that's because we've got a water
cooler 240ml water cooler and also I
have a deleted the CPU - and use liquid
metal I know guys hope this all helped
you catch you in the next Tech video
peace out for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
