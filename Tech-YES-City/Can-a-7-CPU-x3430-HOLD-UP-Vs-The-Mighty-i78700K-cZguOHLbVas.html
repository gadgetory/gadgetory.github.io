really cheap CPU to put into a budget PC
which I do build here quite often on the
channel I came across the X 34:30 which
is a four core four threaded Xeon
similar in comparison to an i5 750
however it was only seven dollars and
this made a world of a difference
especially for people looking to get
into gaming on a mid-range graphics card
like a gtx 1060 so today i'm going to be
comparing this cpu the seven dollar x 34
30 versus the i7 8700 K at 4.9 gigahertz
however the difference is that we're
going to use it with the mid-range
graphics card the GTX 780 which performs
very similar to the GTX 970 which also
performs pretty similar to the GTX 1063
gigabyte edition though how does it fare
in games let's find out welcome back to
tokyo city this is brian coming to you
guys today with a video on extreme price
performance versus the best currently
out there and the x30 430 we got this
thing to 3.8 gigahertz for this
comparison though if you are coupling it
with a very inexpensive motherboard like
a budget h fifty-five motherboard but
you can generally pick up from 30 to 50
dollars if you do have a bit of extra
money if you do get lucky you can get a
good p55 motherboard that will overclock
this thing even higher to perhaps 4
gigahertz however for what it's worth
today's comparison we are running it at
3.8 gigahertz and we're comparing it NC
8700 k now this thing is clock to 5
gigahertz and it is an absolute beast in
gaming this is the currently the best 6
core 12 threaded CPU you can get out
there and it does come in at a whopping
$400 even though it should come in a
little bit cheaper retails are currently
upping the price due to the high demand
of this CPU but with that aside here
today we're testing five different games
dota 2 GTA 5 csgo destiny 2 and pub G
which I've done a little bit of research
on the settings that people use and I'm
using popular competitive settings with
a GTX 780 which can be had for very
cheap I picked up two GTX 780 s in last
month's part hunt for around about 120
Australian which
be like 90 USD each so they are very
inexpensive and they do give great price
performance as well and I have
overclocked this card slightly so it is
running at around one point one
gigahertz on the core and a little bit
more on the memory though with that
aside getting straight into the results
dota 2 we did see quite a big difference
here it was about 33% in favor of the
8700 K and this is one of the worst
results for the X 34:30 here today but
even so one would look at the results
1080p high settings 146 average FPS is
extremely good for a CPU that cost $7
the next game moving on to GTA 5 we had
88 average FPS versus around about a
hundred and seven on the 8700 K itself
so the 8700 K did score another victory
and it was about 25% this time around
csgo looking at this we did decide to
opt the shadow quality to the highest
possible as this is what pros do prefer
when they want to spot enemies so thank
you guys for that recommendation you
told me to change out the settings a
little bit so I did look around and I
found out these were the most popular
settings and what we saw with csgo was
348 average FPS versus 268 see the 8700
K was beating this by again a little
over 35% in this benchmark however
what's interesting to note that the 0.1%
lows did hit practically the same level
and this is due to the graphics I
believe with that shadow quality because
when I usually do this graphics
benchmark on different quality settings
the 0.1% lows are usually quite a bit
higher so if you are gaming on csgo then
you may wish to be careful with that
shadow quality because if it does
stutter in clutch moments then that
could mean the difference between
getting that win for your team and
losing out there next up we had destiny
- and here was the best score for the X
30 for 30 I used quality settings that
really gave me a nice experience at
1080p with the GTX 780 and it would be
good for competitive gaming too so we
saw 122 FPS versus a hundred and 25
average FPS is only a difference of
three fps
at this resolution with the GTX 780 so
this is probably the best result here
for the X 30 for 30 and then we had last
up pub G a very popular game actually
probably the most popular title out
there at the moment with the X 30 for 30
scoring an impressive 90 FPS for the
0.1% low of 58 fps versus the 8700 K
which scored 92 and 8.1 percent low of
61 so keep in mind there is a little bit
of variance in this bench market is a
multi player benchmark so you're never
gonna get a true apples to apples
comparison here but I do test on the
ruins and we did test on very low
settings at 1080p and the results were
actually very impressive for this little
Xeon for core so what does all this mean
well I'll try my best to put this into
perspective for you I believe when
you're going for a mid-range graphics
card even if you want to buy a new
mid-range graphics card like a GTX 1063
gigabyte card for example which run
around $200 then you don't need to go
out and buy a brand new CPU and
motherboard which can cost in excess of
$200 something that I've shown here for
$7 and a cheap motherboard and
inexpensive ddr3 memory could make for a
perfect match with that mid-range
graphics card and the great thing about
this is as well it's not only gonna save
a lot of money you can get into
overclocking and learn how to overclock
because in the future if you do want to
step it up and you've got a bit more
money and you want to get something like
an 80 700 K and a GTX 1080 Ti then
you'll know how to overclock and you'll
be able to extract even more performance
out of your 1080 Ti and your 8700 K but
I must say before I get on out of here
for $7.00 this CPU is just so damn
impressive I was kind of shocked I mean
yes it is only 4 cores 4 threads and
maybe not every single game will support
it or be optimal for it in the future
but honestly for $7 it is a freaking
bargain I think it's the best price
performance beating that of even my ex
5670 Zeon's which are currently one of
my favorite price performance used CPUs
and they're like 6 cores 12 threads
there an actual beast and they'll be
getting a dedicated video of their own
very soon so stay tuned for that and of
course if you like this video - be sure
to hit that like button and let me
no in the comment section below what you
think of this little budget CPU and if
you want to see any more tests like this
and I love reading your comments as
always and if you like the content then
be sure to subscribe and I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
