am at the final run here at the deep
cool booth and they have a new product
and they're also teasing their cases
which will be released in January but
first off year RGB fans these are the RF
120 they come included with coolers but
also with that you can now buy a 3-pack
on their own 49 bucks not bad at all
considering what the competition out
there is asking for their fans you can
get them here they look amazing I've
already tested one with the deep cool
gamax GT cooler these are really nice
RGB fans and I know you guys some of you
guys don't like the RGB factor but if
you're into RGB then these fans
definitely look good and they're not too
overpriced for what they are now moving
on to the cases here behind me we got
the quad Stella this is $4.99 Australian
dollar so it's very expensive but it is
their flagship case now ggf events did a
custom build in this case he's already
showcased it on his channel I'll put the
link in the description below for you
guys but this thing has customization by
app control it also has four different
compartments for the components of your
rig expect this thing to hit the market
in January it is one beast of a case I'm
actually kind of looking forward to
seeing if I can do a build in one of
these myself so now I'm right here
beside the magnetic levitation or fans
these are the MF 120 s they'll be
released in January to $99 for a set of
three and they're also able to be
controlled by a smartphone app as well
and now with these they're an open-air
design but they do have a lot of air
flow you can pull the blades off very
easy they're very sturdy too so it will
be easy to clean these things as well so
to the left of me here we got the
bearing case liquid now this is a case I
saw at Computex has had some slight
refinements made to it and it looks
better than in my opinion than it did
back then and not only that it's
tempered glass but it also comes with a
120 millimeter all-in-one cooler and you
can see at the front here the pump is
displayed live so you can see the liquid
being pumped through it this thing will
hit as well in January for 199
Australian and also 139 USD so now to
the right of me we've got the new arc 90
this is going to be released in January
as well 299 USD price point and if
you're in Australia 329 Aug comes
included with a 280 mm
a radiator three fans calling it RGB RGB
fan in the rear and the RGB lighting
covering the power spliced route so not
as he's gonna be easy to work with but
it's also got three pieces of tempered
glass to get those aesthetics really
cracking and at the front they've got
the reservoir open display with RGB
lighting too you can control this on the
top of the case change the colors or
turn it off if you wish now some of you
guys I think in the Computex video you
said you didn't like the look of this
case something you didn't like about it
I think it looks gorgeous especially in
person and if you didn't like it let me
know what you didn't like about I'd love
to hear your thoughts and comments as
well so that's about it for our coverage
of pax Australia and deep cool booth
they've also been getting into the
atmosphere by giving away cases having
competitions it's really good the vibe
here is awesome I love the deep cooler
getting involved and if you guys enjoyed
this video then be sure to hit that like
button and of course if you have any
questions about today's video or any
other products on display be sure to
drop a coma in the comment section below
and I or someone from deep core will get
back to you as soon as we can and I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
which will be the normal roster very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
