motherboard and you don't know which one
you want to get whether it be an horas
and azuz as rock or an MSI motherboard
well you've come to the right video
because today I'm gonna be comparing all
four against each other we're gonna go
through the vrm temps overclocking the
BIOS the next the onboard audio and also
a big request from you guys on Twitter
to check out the auto overclocking
features as well so exactly who's gonna
be the winner find out at Tech yes
welcome back and here we have for
mammoth XIII 70 motherboards from four
different vendors first up the MSI
gaming Pro carbon AC which comes in at
$200 or if you're in ours three hundred
and thirty dollars so the price is a
little bit off there for us Aziz though
second is the Zeus Strix II which comes
in at 210 us and isn't available in oz
yet
then there's the azrog Z 370 gaming
professional which is two hundred and
seventy dollars though for what it's
worth the Z 370 tachi is the exact same
thing - the ten gigabits per second
Ethernet port and that comes in a 210 or
270 ozzie so it's very well priced in
Australia in terms of Triple P then the
last competitor we have is the
courageous and I say that deliberately
because they and that's
Oris wanted me to put their 140 dollar
ultra gaming board up against the rest
they were confident it compete and you
got to respect that though the Aussie
pricing is a little off costing 250
Australian in comparison though let's
get this show on the road and first up
the V RMS and temperatures here we use
the i7 8700 K at 5 gigahertz and an Ida
60 for stress test for at least 10
minutes to warm up those heat sinks and
really old boards scored roughly the
same here as I tested throughout the day
with slight variations in ambient
temperatures
first up the Ezra came in with its
impressive 12 phase BRM at 70 point 8
degrees at 28 degrees ambient at 1.33
volt and level 1 max LLC drawing around
a hundred and eighty-five watts for
total from the wall and since the Ida
readings were inaccurate for this
motherboard in particular I used
hardware monitor which showed the
voltages were all pun intended
rock-solid this board also managed to
get a stable 5.1 gigahertz at 1.4 volt
winning the max OC as well as
overclocking to 5 gigahertz with the
lowest voltage measured in hardware
monitor post stress testing the Zeus
Trixie however came in very close with a
one point three four volt stable at 5
gigahertz at level 6 LLC which is the
second highest on its smooth 10 phase
vrm wattage was very similar to the as
report and vrm temperatures maxed out at
sixty eight point nine degrees at 26
degrees ambience so virtually the same
and lastly this board managed to pull
the 8700 K into five point one
at one point for two volt and then next
up we had the Auris ultra gaming coming
in with also a smooth criminal' istic
1.34 volt at five gigahertz with a turbo
which essentially means the max level
more on this later LLC setting and also
being able to hit 5.1 gigas at one point
for two volt the vrm temperatures were
sixty eight point eight degrees at 26
degrees ambience on its eight phase--
vrm so what it's from the wall and
temperatures were virtually identical to
the other two last up we have the MSI
gaming Pro carbon a/c coming in with its
10 phase vrm and being able to hit 5
gigahertz at one point 3 5 volt with an
LLC of level for overclocking was a
little strange on the 8700 K on this
board I only just managed to hit 5
gigahertz stable and it did so with only
drawing an extra roughly 10 watts from
the wall so did fall slightly behind the
other three boards here and it couldn't
hit 5.1 gets on the corsair h 110 a
cooler no matter what i did with it v RM
temperatures however were quite good
coming at a 65 point one degrees at 24
degrees ambience so for this first
segment as ROC does score a slight
victory here having a 12 phase v arm
that delivers slightly better on the
overclocked
with albeit the same heat and wattage
which all factors equal is a slightly
better thing the all four boards were
good for a manual 5 gigahertz overclock
on a deal it at i7 8700 K
now under part two here we're gonna take
a look at the BIOS settings and the
performance on these boards and they all
showed Cinebench scores that were all
roughly the same and the memory latency
timings showed the same - so nothing to
really gain in terms of hidden
performance by buying one motherboard
over the other at the same clock
settings however I will say that the m2
slot provided by the azuz Strix II did
actually work and it worked
exceptionally well dropping the nvme SSD
temperatures running on full load after
10 minutes by a whopping 20 degrees
great to see an implementation of this
that actually works
the MSI m2 shield on the other hand
actually increased temperatures by
roughly four degrees and not to mention
it's right near where a hot GPU
backplate would be sitting and stuck in
between a CPU and it's cooler this does
need some improvement MSI so I'd like to
see this fixed in a future release those
this does get props for implementing
something that not only works really
well but also looks very pleasing to the
other two boards from as rock and Oris
just had naked nvme slots which gives
the victory to a Zeus here Zeus also has
the option to mount a fan a 40
millimeter one over the vrm heatsink -
with the vrm bracket included there is
also a CPU installation help kit to
guide your cpu in especially handy if
this is going to be your first day lid
now what about all the different biases
this is where the azuz and Ezreal boards
scored a victory here having all the
settings I could personally want and
also having the option to quickly and
easily update your boss via routed
internet connection all four boards have
backup biases and it was impressive to
see that the boss update methods on all
four boards manually reset your PC
revert to safe default settings and then
update which is a general improvement
all round though I'd like to see both
MSI and ORS offer the option to update
the blast via Internet in the future the
overclocking settings on the Auris -
were quite tedious some of the
vocabulary used could definitely use
some work changing things like the LLC
labeling - levels from one to five for
example with diagrams would be great to
help first-time overclockers instead of
just having standard turbo and rocket
boost settings as the labels the msi did
score some props here for having
everything you need to overclock all on
the same
this is very easy for first-time
overclockers and I've found locking in
the settings here were quick and easy so
the Emma sidebars is great for you guys
if it's your first 8700 K or your 8600 K
and you're gonna get into overclocking
though switching gears over to the azouz
board it had an extra feature that I
noticed and that was live memory
overclocking which is very useful for
people trying to fast track a high
memory overclock since memory over
clocks usually just have a bar if you
are over that bar you're stable under
and your system will freeze so nice
addition on the Strix II last up we have
asrock here we have the simplicity mixed
in with detail asrock biases always
offer everything I need with laid out
descriptions the offset setting I found
is great for stability too on the 8700 K
at 5.1 gigahertz and they offer the RGB
lighting control direct from the bias
itself so you don't need to install any
extra apps and lastly smart fan control
across all four boards was exceptional
here too
though segue into this next test is one
that you guys requested I do on Twitter
the auto overclocking here the winner
was horas with their gaming ultra board
I lucked in the 5 gigahertz Auto OC
setting and to my surprise this worked
first go and it was completely stable
albeit the voltage was at one point
three nine volt versus one point three
four volt so it was roughly 50 milli
volt higher than the manual tune but it
was the only board here to lock in a
usable 5 gigahertz table off the auto IC
feature the azouz board did have a 5
gigahertz - but I found the clocks were
all over the place and the Cinebench
score reflected this as well so this
will probably get better in a future
blast update however there was an easy
tuning function and this was interesting
to say the least when I opened it up it
had three different settings and I found
that the actual box coolest setting
included was the one that worked and
worked extremely well the water cooler
and the air coolers actually crashed the
computer so they weren't stable at all
but the Box cooler setting managed to
lock in a four point nine five gigahertz
overclock which was stable and it worked
really well then next up we had asrock
with their 5 gigahertz auto OC they also
had different settings as well going
from 4.4 to 4.8% abyss it through the
voltage up to 1.5 volt and out of the
wall it was juicing way too much wattage
so although stable it was a potential
CPU melting stable one which I can't
recommend at all the 4.8 gigahertz auto
OC however was rock stable at one point
three nine volt so it was overloading
the CPU way too much but that said
however this 4.8 gigahertz should work
on any 8700 K I don't imagine one that
it wouldn't work on the msi board also
had the auto overclock feature labeled
as game boost and upon turning that on
it got two windows and started the
stress test and then going back down to
4.4 gigahertz so it was ultimately just
a hundred megahertz boost this also
showed up in the cinnamon scores as well
very odd is in the previous generation I
am positive that it was Emma sized board
that hit the most amazing Auto overclock
I've seen in my life
this got made 7700 K to 5 gigahertz at
pretty much the manual overclocked
settings that are locked in myself so
I mean MSI if you fired that guy doing
the overclocks in your bias division you
need to bring him back please he did
some amazing work last generation though
anyways surprisingly the lowest-cost
board here came in with the best auto
overclock so kudos to orous I guess that
confidence is starting to build up a
little bit now it's time to talk about
aesthetics audio and extra features and
aesthetics is really going to be
subjective I'm gonna say just take a
look at the b-roll and see which one
looks best for you I honestly love the
RGB lighting on the Auris it looks
gorgeous at night though it does come at
the expense of having no AC Wireless
unlike the other three boards here and
also there is no clear CMOS on the back
so some features have been sacrificed
for that spicy lighting though the audio
was very good having roughly minus 80
decibels of crosstalk and all
motherboards had very low crosstalk and
they're all pretty much using the same
Realtek ALC 12:20 despite the naming
differences though the differences here
in the crosstalk itself between the azuz
horas and asrock boards is that they all
had a slight leaking of crosstalk at a
volume level over 90 and then the MSI
board exhibited the same leaking at a
volume level over 95 so basically keep
the volume at 90 or under if you are in
one of the Triple A motherboards and 95
and under if you're on the MSI board
frequency response curve showed that all
four boards were exceptional here with
under 10 Hertz only having roughly a -3
decibel drop-off this is the sub base so
you shouldn't even notice it and it
shouldn't be any different to normal
headphones unless you like some shake in
your headphones which I do as for RGB
control they all have their own apps for
controlling RGB lighting however Zeus
does have the widest supported options
with the aura sync lighting and has two
headers for 5 volt and 12 volt options
though as for the mic imports I will let
you guys have a listen we're gonna start
this microphone test off with the v-moda
burn pro plugged directly into the Z 3
70s rock fatality gaming Pro with the
volume level of 85 and +10 DB so here is
the Z 370 East Rick's motherboard I'm
just gonna quickly stop the fans
manually with
hands and you guys can hear four there's
any noise here's a sound test on the Z
370 carbon pro AC from MSI with the
v-moda burn pro at the same levels as
you heard before
here's quick mic test on the Z 370 horas
ultra gaming motherboard with a volume
level of 80 and plus 10 decibels and as
stated before the Auris board doesn't
carry wireless unfortunately though the
MSI carbon series has an add-in PCIe
wireless and the Strix AM fatality
boards carry this onboard with their AC
and bluetooth features all three had
strong signal strength to boot
connecting to my router with all having
five bars at 2.4 gigahertz and all
having three bars at five gigahertz the
router is roughly ten meters away on the
floor below so it does have to travel
through a few walls all four boards
carry programs to adjust things like RGB
lighting and adjust clocks in Windows if
you wish to as well this is where as
well the DPC latency app from MSI adds
to simplicity on overclocking with the
MSI boards though ultimately for this
category there really isn't a winner
it's more a subjective thing that way
we'll say the Azeroth board does have
dual onboard one gigabit NICs even on
the Taichi and in the case of the
fatality it has a further third NIC that
is 10 gigabits per second which and a
$70 premium over the Taichi isn't bad
going at all though the people who would
utilize this I am sure are far and few
however one thing the Azeroth board does
have which I love is a clear CMOS button
the other three boards don't have this
on the rear and this is honestly the
best spot for this button especially
once you put all your components in a
case and you want to start overclocking
there is also a debug LED readout that
can double down as a CPU temperature
readout which I found is really cool in
operation and lossy compatibility on all
four boards was fine with the corsair 16
gigabyte to buy a kit that i used and i
did use the latest biased revisions
before testing these boards throughout
the 12th and 13th of November 2017
so now it's time for the conclusion
which Z 370 should you buy which is the
best well they are all good for an
overclocked 8700 k and they all have
exceptionally good onboard audio and
performed well at 5 gigahertz with a 3
gigahertz XMP corsair memory kit though
they all have their strengths and
weaknesses
first off the Auris ultra gaming
budget-friendly impressive aesthetics in
my opinion solid auto OC which took this
to 5 gigahertz and also a max manual
overclock did hit 5.1 gigahertz -
however BIOS features and labeling could
use some improvement and there is also
no wireless onboard the chipset itself
next up is the Strix II intricate bias
and some features not seen on the other
three boards great manual overclocking
and the m-dot - heatsink worked
exceptionally well 5.1 gigahertz was
also obtainable - however the 5
gigahertz auto OC and also some of the
easy tuning pitches could use some
touching up and it was quite wonky and
I'm sure a Zeus will update this soon
however the first auto OC option did
work really well scoring four point nine
five gigahertz so coming very close to
the Auris board though RGB options and
the aesthetics were also smooth to third
in line we have the MSI gaming Pro
carbon a/c this had the strength of
having a very beginner friendly BIOS
great if it's your first time
overclocking manually and also the apps
in Windows make this super easy to
include a PCIe Wireless is nice you can
port this over to future builds or sell
it separately if you don't need it
however the implementation of the vrm
and the power delivery was slightly
behind the other three boards I thought
just slightly and I managed to hit five
gigahertz stable though 5.1 gigahertz
wasn't obtainable and the game Boost
auto IC was near useless only giving an
extra 100 megahertz over a stock 8700 K
factory clock and the included m2 shield
made temperatures of the m2 SSD hotter
so that definitely needs to get fixed
now last up we have the Azeroth fatality
professional and as I said before
however I will be basing this off the
Tai Chi which I feel is more practical
for most people it was the most
expensive at $210 however it was the
winner in today's comparison at least
for me and I'm not saying this because
they're a channel sponsor asrock have
been completely on point with their
motherboards since the x99 days this is
e 370 is no different feature packed and
all about control it has a 12 phase vrm
and the bias is awesome to work with and
you even have the option to control your
RGB and other options that just makes
sense for overclockers looking to get
the most out of the CPUs on either air
or water over clocks without breaking
the bank the auto OSI feature also
worked third best in this comparison
with the 4.8 gigahertz being a stable
medium however asrock you need to fix
that 5 gigahertz Auto SC setting as it
was locking in some very dangerous
settings which I can't recommend anyone
put in though that aside a clear CMOS
button in a handy debug LED that can
double down as the CPU temp readout of
it also has three MDOT two slots to boot
and you guys that's it for today and
also last night Z 370 comparison if you
enjoyed this video then don't forget to
hit that like button this one took me a
long time to do also if you have any
comments about today's video or you have
any comments on overclocking in general
then drop a comment the comment section
below a lot of people are pretty
experienced around here they'll be able
to help you out straight away if not
I'll be sure to drop a reply in myself
or if you want to ask me a question
directly you can follow me on Twitter I
usually reply pretty quickly there and
with that aside let me know in the
comments - what was your favorite board
out of today's comparison and why I love
reading your comments as always and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
