to me and asked me to take a look at
some of their CPU coolers I thought hell
yes I love anything tech enthusiast
related and then not sure at the same
time also told me to take a look at
their you 12s and then use 14s so I took
this as an opportunity to compare the
gold standard knock schewe up against
the new up come or even and what we've
got for you guys today is one CPU cooler
showdown welcome back to tech city this
is brian coming to you guys today with
kind of like a review slash showdown of
four different coolers going
head-to-head with contestants knock
schewe and a new up comer in the market
cold or even now before I did this video
I'd never heard of reven and they kind
of got this whole black and yellow theme
going on they've also got a variety of
different coolers and the two that I got
here are the akeno's which is like their
big bad boy that competes with the d15
and the assassin and then they've got
like a mini ITX solution called the
stair opes which is kind of like 60 mil
tall is quiet and also is meant to be
for a mini ITX build but without a side
we'll get on to the temperature test and
take a look at how these things fed
against my mill storm 360 all in one
water cooler on my deep cooled genome
so looking at these results we can see
that the youth 14s scored the best
results of all these four different air
coolers and this is against the mill
storm 360 which is an all-in-one
solution with three different fans on
there and it is a water cooler and that
came in about 4 degrees low with ambient
temperatures of around about 25 degrees
now one thing that impressed me as well
was the U 12s which is quite a small
solution and even on the x99 solution it
was going up to max 86 degrees which is
still acceptable at a four point four
gigahertz overclock now looking at the
akeno's now that thing actually scored
pretty bad in my opinion it only came in
two degrees better than the u 12s though
the sheer size of this thing is in the
likes of that of a D 15 and also the
deep cool assassin which both those
coolers in my opinion not only have
better installation but also do a better
job of cooling it lost to the U 14s by
about 4 degrees and the new 14s isn't
even as good as the D 14 nor the D 15 so
it goes to show that the reven akeno's
is really not that good of a solution
especially coming in around $73 there I
think I'd rather go with the deep cool
assassin or the D 14 which is on Amazon
at the moment for around about the same
price if you want to step it up to the
best in the business that would be the D
15 though next we'll get onto the
steroids because this was a very
interesting solution and unlike the
akeno's I really liked this unit I
thought installation was a breeze I
thought the build quality of this unit
was phenomenal and also when you got
this unit work and you also had behind
that fan there some really cool sort of
looking artwork there if you'd call it
that now not to mention the temperatures
of the stirrups this thing did really
well when I tested it on my 4.6
gigahertz overclock 2500 K in the
background here which is arguably some
of the most pressure that you'd want for
this mini ITX cooler it scored
phenomenally well
I love the temperature 70's 9 degrees
maximum at 27 degrees ambient
temperatures not to mention the noise
was really quiet let's have a listen
and with that said that was honestly the
loudest that any of these solutions got
here so I will give credit to all four
coolers that I tested here today or
actually in the last week that they're
all quite low on noise so anyone with a
bit of OCD will love any of these
solutions that I've talked about here
today but this tariffs really stood out
with $50 price tag the looks in the
cosmetics were really good installation
was a breeze and also the temperatures
were phenomenal if I had to critique it
one thing about the syrups I would like
to see LGA 2011 support there as I
believe this thing could quite easily
handle a 5820k for instance at 4
gigahertz and still fit in a Mini ITX
rig with a clearance height of 60 mil it
will fit in a lot of low sort of form
factor solutions there if you're using
it or if you want to use it for a mini
ITX build so its conclusion time knock
shew a gold standard as usual you 12 su
14s just more solutions in their product
lineup great installation on both these
kids very straightforward also the
springs and things like that everything
included in this kit is just a breeze
not to mention the performance is really
good on any of noxious coolers when you
consider the size to performance ratio
the price is a little bit up there but
again that's what you pay for quality
you get what you pay for in this world
and not sure it as always is the gold
standard when it comes to CPU air
cooling the one thing I will critique
about not schewe is I would love to see
them include from the get-go from the
factory the black and white cooling
solution there on the fan is I think it
looks much better than the beige and
sort of brown look that they've got
going on there and I think in 2016 I
would like to see them drop that beige
and brown fan look out of the box and
maybe even start powder coating black
and white on their fan solutions to give
people a little bit of an option there
when it comes to cosmetics because as
far as the performance and the noise is
concerned they're pretty much the best
in the business though ultimately with
the knock Shore products I can highly
recommend them for what they are you get
the you 12s coming in around about $60
and you've also got the you 14s coming
in around about $70 I'd probably go
through the you 14s if you had the size
as it was just a beast of a cooler and
it was still smaller than those very
large solutions but still did a very
similar job in terms of performance now
let's talk about reven the newcomer in
the market I like the black and yellow
theme especially the seraphs that thing
looks as sexy as hell I love it
performance is good noises low
installations a breeze and the price is
decent of fifty dollars the akeno's I
think that needs a lot of work
especially when you've got competitors
out there like the deep cool assassin
like the D 14 and D 15 that do a better
job of not only price but also
performance and installation as well so
I'd like to see them improve on the
akeno's or maybe even drop it down to
$60 which I think at that price I could
probably recommend it though its current
price of around $73 at least that's what
I see it for on you egg I can't
recommend it anyway that's it for me
today if you guys enjoyed this review
showdown between these four different
coolers from R even and not sure then be
sure to hit that like button if you have
any questions or comments about any of
these coolers or if you've tried them or
whatnot then be sure to drop a cone in
the comment section below let's discuss
things about Raven and both not sure
love to hear your thoughts and comments
there and I'll catch you in the next
Tech video very soon he's out for now
