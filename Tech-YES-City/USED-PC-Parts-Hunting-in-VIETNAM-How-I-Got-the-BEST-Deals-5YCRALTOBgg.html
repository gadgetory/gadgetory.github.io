- Whoa!
Finally we are in
Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh city
and I've ducked in here and we're gonna do
some used PC parts hunting before we get
on with the Galax Overclock Events,
so stay tuned for that,
it's gonna be crazy.
But, we're in the magical city
and a lot has happened since I just first
ducked in here a day ago and I'll probably
make a dedicated video towards that
but if you guys are looking for used
PC parts hunts here, I've already
sort of started sourcing things out.
Shpock, that app on your smartphone,
absolute bust, also Let Go,
absolute bust, but Facebook
Marketplace, now we're talking.
We're gonna line up some deals.
But before we've lined up those deals,
which I've already got a DTX 750Ti
and apparently I've already got
a GTX 1060 as well, we can talk
about those prices later,
we're gonna go check
out some used computer
stores in Ho Chi Minh city here
with my driver and translator Daisy.
So let's get it on.
- [Daisy] Hello.
- Do you constantly find yourself
strapped for time in a rush to do things
and sometimes you might
forget your passwords?
Well if you're that kind of person
then today's video sponsor, LastPass
has an extension that you can install
on any popular browser
on a wide range of OS's, ranging
from Windows to MacOS to Linux.
It essentially acts as a friend
that you have one master account for
where you can put those details in
and then they'll remember
all those passwords
for all those sites that you may visit
but you don't really frequently visit them
and you may often find
yourself forgetting passwords for.
I use this on my travel PC,
my personal PC and it
just saves so much time,
especially for the sites that I just
don't really care for and it's also free
to use for individual use.
So what are you waiting for?
Check out the link in
the description below.
Let's get back to the hustle.
(inspirational tech music)
(inspirational tech music)
- So we're now outside
the first tech store.
This place is called Phong Vu
and I've been recommended
this from Google.
So let's just go in and check it out
and see what they've got.
(inspirational tech music)
(inspirational tech music)
(inspirational tech music)
- So we just got out of that place.
Ended up being a complete bust
both through and through.
New parts were overpriced and also
the used parts, in regards to some used
cases that were there, even then they
were still pretty overpriced.
I mean some of them you could get
for 15 Aussie dollars but again
we've picked up better deals in the past
and honestly when it comes to cases,
we're not gonna have any room in the
suitcase to fit these things in so,
we're just going to keep tooling around
this district because it does look like
there's a lot of computer stores.
I'm just going to ask if they've got
any used parts that are
for sale and if they do,
we're gonna see if we can strike a deal.
(inspirational tech music)
(inspirational tech music)
(inspirational tech music)
(inspirational tech music)
(inspirational tech music)
- So we had to interrupt the shopping
because right here on the desk I have
the first deal, so we
have completely broken
the spell of a drought in Vietnam
and we got this for two million dong
which would be about a 115
Aussie dollars or something like that,
somewhere along the lines of 85 USD.
So it's actually a Biostar
GTX1063 gigabyte, now
I didn't know Biostar
sold 1060's but again
a 1060 is a 1060, I'm
not going to discriminate
and that is one deal in the bag.
So Vietnam, used PC parts scene
is looking good already 'cause we got
this deal on Facebook Marketplace
and also the guy delivered
it to us as well.
So, delivered right to us, bang!
Amazing deal, let's keep shopping.
(upbeat tech music)

(upbeat tech music)
(upbeat tech music)

(upbeat tech music)
- So we're now back at the same spot
that we were at before with the Phong Vu
except we went looking around now
another street where there's just a lot
of different PC part
places but there seems
to be a trend going on
here where there's a lot
of Xeon's, old Xeon systems for sale.
And so it's kind of like
there's hustler's specials.
Where they'll get the old Z280's and put
a Xeon in there, registered memory
and then also besides that, they'll
put a graphics card in and you got
yourself a gaming PC.
But when we saw the
prices of the new parts,
they were really expensive.
And some of the stores here for example
want around 750 US dollars for a
GTX 1080 and that's like that's
a used 1080, it's not
really a good deal at all.
But, we just walked
out of this store here,
its's called Truong
Giang and I walked inside
and I'm just like,
'cause I'm going around all these places
and say, used PC parts, cash, straight up
bang on the table and they had
a GTX 750 Ti and they
wanted 900,000 for it,
I'm like, well how about we just
do a little bit of bargaining here.
He said, &quot;One month warranty.&quot;
I said, &quot;Well I'm flying back,
&quot;no one month warranty, 800,000,
&quot;put the cash on the table.&quot;
I actually kind of put
it down with authority.
And he was like, &quot;Yep,
okay we've got a deal.&quot;
So there's a 750 Ti in the bag
which is about 47 Aussie dollars,
in US dollars it'd be close
to like 30-something, 33 USD maybe.
Very good price for a 750 Ti.
So now we're gonna continue around
this street here and see
if we can find anymore deals.
And yes, I am embracing the Vietnamese
culture with this hat right here.
I got it for about two,
two dollars I think.
(upbeat tech music)
(upbeat tech music)
(upbeat tech music)
(upbeat tech music)
(upbeat tech music)
- So we have just been up and down
the last couple of hours around
the streets of Ho Chi Minh city trying
to get those deals.
I've been completely sweating my butt off
so if you could just hit
that like button for us.
That'd be greatly appreciated.
But besides that, what we came into
after the 750 Ti was
essentially nothing so far.
It's been a complete bust
where I've been writing
down with a pen and paper if they
didn't speak English.
I was writing down like I7 2600,
3770 GTX 7 series, 9 series, 10 series,
motherboards, you name it.
I was trying to get deals on it.
And so, basically the deal of hustling is,
if they're talking around
your ballpark figure,
then you keep talking.
But if they don't then you just walk.
It's a pretty simple thing and basically
with the I 7, even an I 7 2600, they were
trying to ask like four million dong
for that and I just laughed.
I said, &quot;What, that's like
&quot;220 Aussie dollars for a I 7 2600.&quot;
And I told them, &quot;Look
I gotta Ryzen 5 2600
&quot;for cheaper than that,
brand new in the box.&quot;
And they were like, &quot;Oh,
okay I guess this guy
&quot;knows what's up now,
&quot;we're trying to rip him off.&quot;
So, I'm not sure if
that's just because I'm
a foreigner in Vietnam,
they're just trying
to jack the price up.
But also another thing as well, was they
wanted even some stores,
1050 Ti's they wanted
about 220 US dollars for that.
I sort of said, &quot;Okay is
that brand new or used?&quot;
I think they said it was
new, but the box looked
like it was pre-opened as well and it
seemed to be every store
I went around here,
had a GTX 1050 Ti
Cerberus, so this kind of
reminded me of Thailand when they had
all those motherboards that were Zeus,
the B360's I think and those old pre-NDA.
So maybe that stuff's coming off
the back of the truck, who knows?
But another thing too, my translator,
she speaks a little bit of English,
but she doesn't really
know PC parts at all,
so when I'm talking to her about PC parts,
she's just scratching her head.
But essentially what we're gonna do now
is we're going to head over now about
eight kilometers out away
from here on the bike.
We're gonna from what Google says is
a used computer store and it's got
five star reviews.
So we're gonna go check that out
and then later on in the night
hopefully pick up some more deals
off Facebook Marketplace.
So, let's get movin'.
(inspirational tech music)
(inspirational tech music)
(inspirational tech music)
(inspirational tech music)
- So now we've rocked
up at the destination
for this buying and selling used
computer parts except there's actually
just one big problem.
That is, the store doesn't even exist.
And so I'm looking for this place
and the the neighbors are
telling my translator,
&quot;Yo, this place doesn't even exist here.
&quot;I don't know why you're here.&quot;
And I was like, &quot;okay&quot;.
So at that time, I'm thinking well why
don't we just try another
computer store in the area.
So we went to another place
and again there was just no
physical store that exists.
So, I'm gonna try go to
another place close by.
So we'll try one more store and if that
doesn't exist then we're
just going to go back
into District One because
everyone's just kind of
looking at me around
here like, &quot;yo, why are
you even in this area?&quot;.
So, who knows?
(upbeat tech music)
(upbeat tech music)
(upbeat tech music)
(upbeat tech music)
(upbeat tech music)
- So now, at the last place, PC World,
that was a complete bust, a waste of time.
They had just, I guess
old, real old LGA775 stuff
there, so basically just gonna go back now
to the city, kick around until this next
Facebook deal comes along
from the marketplace.
And then after that, we'll tally up what
we got in Vietnam.
I guess some of these
places outside of the city,
they fix up real sort
of dinosaur old parts
and I couldn't even find
the first two stores
and we just looked around
everywhere around there.
So I don't know what
exactly is going on there.
But we'll keep you guys updated as we keep
this parts hunt live and it's kind of,
maybe I'm in a weird part of town, 'cause
kind of getting an
audience out here as well,
so it's pretty cool.
So, yeah, hey!
Say hello.
(inspirational tech music)
(inspirational tech music)
(inspirational tech music)
(inspirational tech music)
- So here we are now.
Just picked up the 750
Ti, so we've got two
GTX 750 Ti's and this
time around, this one
had no fan on it, but he
assures me that it works.
He's shown me pictures of it working.
And I got that for 750,000 dong which
is about 43 Aussie dollars I'd say
or yeah, so pretty much 30 USD flat.
So it's a little bit
cheaper than the other one
but it doesn't have a fan which is not
a problem because I do believe that I have
a broken 750 Ti that I
should be able to take
the heat sync from that
and plug it into this one.
Anyway, that aside, I've got three awesome
deals already on Gravis cards.
We're gonna get back to the hotel as well
and sort of sum up everything because
I have been on Messenger and I have been
scouring the rest of the deals that
are out there and we'll talk about that
as well as talking about, I guess the Meta
in Vietnam if you're looking to build
a PC on the cheap.
(inspirational tech music)
(inspirational tech music)
- So I'm back at the hotel and I've got
three Gravis cards here on the table that
are just incredible deals.
These are better deals than I would've got
back in Oz which is why I picked them up.
This is Vietnam.
It's been a success for deals hunting.
In terms of getting the other stuff
like motherboards and
CPUs and even memory,
I still think you're better off maybe
going off AliExpress, hence why I didn't
I guess pick up any of those deals here
because a lot of the
parts they were trying
to overcharge for them.
For instance even on Facebook Messenger,
there was a guy trying
to sell me a 1240 Xeon,
Sandy Bridge essentially
like a I 7 2600, trying
to sell me that for like 90 USD.
I'm like, &quot;Hey, man I
can get this off Ali,
'shipped to my door for 60.&quot;
And he kind of didn't respond
and I was like, &quot;Okay, whatever.&quot;
Also in terms of Metas in Vietnam
putting together a super budget
1080P gaming rig, we've got the 750 Ti's,
you can pick them up
for pretty cheap here.
And then you can slam
them in a I5 OEM desktop
like a HP or a Dell, which I did see going
for about 2.4 million dong, which would
still be under a 100 USD.
They'll still have nine
five, and also RAM,
a hard drive, pass by, all that stuff.
So if you got one of them, put a 750Ti in
you'd have a really good budget gaming PC
for under 200 USD, in Australian dollars
it would just over 200 AUD.
So you definitely put yourself together
something really good and even then
you could probably go
get a I7 Xeon equivalent
off AliExpress and
you'd just have yourself
some awesome 1080P gaming.
You could play all
those competitive titles
and still be ahead.
So in terms of new PC
parts here in Vietnam,
I do think it's a bit of a bust.
Prices are better in Australia
and also in the US so it's not really
one place to go to get new PC parts.
But definitely when it comes to used
PC parts this place is crackin'
It's mainly the Facebook
Marketplace though
I did find a store in the city where I did
pick up a pretty solid deal.
Anyways I hope you enjoyed
today's used PC parts.
I'm in Vietnam and if you did
be sure to hit that like button.
Also in another video,
I will be detailing all
the behind scenes hustles
that's gone on here into making this vlog,
as well as just Vietnam itself.
It's been an absolute blast being here.
I've just enjoyed it so much
and it's the craziest
thing is it's just gone
from absolute chaos in the first day where
I even lost my suitcase
and I'll be talking
about that in the next video.
And it's gone from that that to just
being so epic now.
And that's where the translator comes in,
in case you're wondering.
You're probably like,
&quot;Damn, Brian, you got this
&quot;young, cute girl driving you around.&quot;
But she was actually a lifesaver
in that she helped with a few different
things and I thought I
came into this country
being like, &quot;Yeah,
everyone speaks English,
&quot;it will be fine.&quot;
But no guys, actually a lot less people
speak English in this
country, for example,
than they would in Thailand,
at least in the main city.
So, I actually came into some really
weird stuff and I'll detail
that all in the next video.
But other than that, also stay tuned
because we got the Galax OC event
where we're gonna be overclocking
Gravis cards, RTX cards on LN2.
It's gonna be crazy.
I'm gonna make sure you guys
have a really good
experience with that video.
And also on that note,
don't forget to check
out today's video sponsor
LastPass, helping remember your passwords
so you never have to
forget a password again.
The link is in the description below.
And with that, I'll catch you
in another video very soon.
Hope you enjoyed this one.
Peace out for now. Bye.
