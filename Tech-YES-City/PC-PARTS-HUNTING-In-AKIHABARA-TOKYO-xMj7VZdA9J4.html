city just got into Tokyo and the first
thing I am going to start doing is
hunting those used parts and we're going
to do two videos while I'm here this is
the first of them go on our key harbour
to try and find a new case it's a unique
case and I'll try and find it if it
tears from a company called Jon's oh but
I'm also going to look for those use
parts deals so let's get on with it but
I got to eat sighs I'm starving so let's
go get some sushi or something so if you
guys are in Tokyo and you're looking for
a new computer the knocking hover is
definitely the place to come they've
actually got the best deals that can
even beat out the internet in terms of
prices when you come into Akihabara
however there are some places here that
do sell use parts so we're going to go
into one place called Gumo they've
actually got a whole floor with two core
parts and that means use parts in
Japanese you want to head in there first
and then go check out if they've got any
good deals and if they do of course
we're going to buy them but keep in mind
with Tokyo you're not really going to
get the best deals possible man it's so
hard to film in tokyo sometimes
so we just left school oh then and I
picked up the gravis card which I bought
years ago the GTX 670 from galaxy this
is actually not the galaxy brand it's
actually a gallery and so I got that for
$60 about 60 us for a GTX 670 so not bad
at all they did have some other deals in
there but I didn't really check them out
they weren't that good so I'm going to
go around to another few places now and
see if they've got the deals as always
but now we're probably at one of my
favorite spots in Akihabara because to
the right of me they got a place called
buy more and then to the left of me
they've got a place called soft map and
now in this soft map they've got some
really good deals especially on youth
parts but also new parts too and then
this place here has some actually really
good one time deal on new parts so let's
go into the new spots first and check
that out
and then we go into the new part this is
actually pretty cool here's a $50
tempered glass case so I would buy it if
I was living here that you know since
I'm not living here and I have to travel
I'd easily break the tempered glass so
if anyone wants to achieve case and $50
in sofmap in tokyo alright guys so we
just finished in soft map and they told
me as well like don't film inside and
I'm like and then I just found out some
excuse like I just want to remember the
prices later suck and chicken but they
ended up being a boss I mean there
wasn't any good deals in there I did
find actually something that I've never
seen in the flesh before and that was a
q77 chipset so I'm not actually sure if
they are support overclocking or not
from memory but I have to check later
but they have a GTX 760 for like 110
dollars and I was like nah that's not a
deal at all the 670 was a much better
deal and on that note in scoobo they
actually have one more 670 for $60 so if
anyone's in Tokyo they can go check that
out
so we just got out of buy more and this
place is definitely cracking if you guys
want to pick up some new parts they
didn't have really any use parts besides
like a b-grade deck for the gigabyte
motherboard but in there I was seriously
considering building a mini ITX Rison PC
they had this deal going with a BIOS
table be 350 and I don't know what the
deal was there because they had the BIOS
that x3 70-minute idx border they looked
exactly the same so I don't know what
the difference there was I thought the X
370 had like a few extra features which
you didn't get on the mini ATX board and
so it doesn't really matter so inside I
was like wow so they got the hundred
dollars for the mini ITX Biostar be
thrifty board and then they've got a
rising CPU for about two hundred and
something and then a gtx 1050 TI which
requires no 6-pin connector going for
like a hundred and twenty-five dollars
or something like that and then they've
got this awesome case inside called the
Ragin tech Medus or something and that's
like only about $60 so I'm seriously
considering at this point building a
mini ITX rig because the last one I
built in America I got built that for
like a thousand dollars and then when I
go back to Australia just did a hock job
on it and I made some money on it too so
it's a really cool experience is always
to build the PC and then sell it make
some money but of course I want to check
around and see you know what else my
budget truck but then I want to check
out the rest of our key harbour in terms
of the hot spots to use part before I do
make this decision but it's going to be
on my mind so let's go check out these
other place okay so we just got out of
dose power and then got to different
stores so that one's for new parts but
the cool thing is about that place was I
found the Mini ITX case that I was
thinking about before for like ten
dollars cheaper so the cool thing about
our key hover is you can look around all
the different stores and check out the
best prices on each then of all the
individual parts that you want and then
you can just really probably save like
fifty dollars even on the already cheap
prices here and get the best best deal
you can as opposed to just buying it
from one store also another thing I
found out is that I do want
Wireless if I am to build this mini ITX
PC I'm definitely don't want Wireless on
that Mini ITX motherboard integrated or
after that place behind me called arc PC
I just went in there and it was a bust
they didn't have any used parts and also
the prices of the new parts were
expensive as well now one thing I did
see is that the rx 570 and 580 craze has
actually hit Tokyo as well so the
graphics cards getting sold out but one
thing I did see here is the Bitcoin
mining motherboard which have like 13
PCIe slots that support all the graphics
card Rises and that will go on for about
a hundred and forty dollars which I
think if you got them and sold them on
eBay you could make a quick buck I'm
just not too sure and how much they go
for on eBay but and I'm not really in
the mood because I'm on travel and I
don't have enough room in my suitcase so
I'm not really in the mood to flip
things like that but let's go to that
dos para now and see if they've got the
use part okay so we just got out of dos
power the place that sold used parts and
that was a complete bust you know at the
bus when the graphics card you just
bought is like twenty dollars cheaper
this place so they had some all in ones
as well and that was the boss as well
the prices are just too high
so this stage I'm going to try one more
place see if I get some good use deals
there if not the first place that we
went to was probably the best and I'm
probably going to pull the trigger on
that Mini ITX rig now so I just get out
of this place it used to be soft map now
it's called bit camera and the whole
place has been like commercialized now
and there's even no PC parts in this
store I don't know what's going on in
Akihabara but it feels like all the
hermit's are leaving this place they're
abandoning it
there's just no like real price
performance enthusiast deals especially
on the use part all the Japanese Hermits
like dying of rigor mortis or something
like what is going on I'm just confused
Akihabara is just not feeling hermit
anymore anyway the
so it's pretty hot around here I've been
doing a lot of walking and I found a
place called shop inverse now if you
guys are looking to just get an
all-in-one PC that actually turns on it
works it's got an i7 in it a decent
power supply and you pick it up for
around one hundred and thirty dollars
which is a really good price considering
yeah it's got all the parts you need you
just whack a decent graphics card in
like a GTX 670 maybe and you know you've
got a gaming PC kind of something maybe
even a little bit better than the bang
job that I built on the channel but this
was a really cool find I think that's
probably like all the hunting I've done
here and it's really not that much but
you can still get a decent deal in Tokyo
on use part but I just got to the bus
stop now ended up finishing up in Tokyo
and it was crazy and I mean I couldn't
film in all these stores like I did
sneak a bit of footage and I do it a
little sneak in there you know got some
footage but a lot of the places they
just said no filming no filming buy or
even roll you some footage now ah and so
man it must be like the invasion of
YouTube is in Akihabara because
everywhere I went just Hawking on me
straight up so I'd love to get you guys
footage in the stores and just you know
go ham in there but I couldn't but
anyway got you guys updated on all the
latest deals ended up pulling the
trigger on some of the mini ITX gear I
got my tax off as well because I'm on a
three-month traveling visa now if you
come to Tokyo and you're on a
three-month visa that you automatically
get if you're from like the UK or
Australia or the US I'm pretty sure you
want to actually get it and you can get
your tax so eight percent off all the
items at a lot of places and it actually
makes a big difference like I think some
of the parts I got here today
I like the cheapest in the world at
least for the prices I could find them
for so hence why I'm building this mini
ITX rig here I've showcased it on the
channel and also you know if I don't use
it for a few months I can do a hock job
make some money back - so pretty awesome
deals the GTX 670 was really good
there's also still another one there I
was going to pick it up it's late now I
don't be too greedy
so it's not what the GTX 670 and
all-in-one that I showed before that's a
really good combo for like 200 bucks see
behind late last night instead of being
a noisy intruder I decided to film it in
the morning and a good thing guys is ya
get that passport if you come here and
you're traveling get the passport
because you will get a really good
discount you get eight percent off on
all your stuff and that made that ten
fifty TI like literally a hundred and
twenty bucks that was incredible for a
new graphics card like a 1050 TI and it
doesn't even need a six pin as well so
that's awesome some other really cool
things about Tokyo I noticed was there
was like new products there that I
haven't seen those this 27 millimeter
low-profile all-metal fan from thermal
tape that was really cool there was also
a sister I know a lot of people like
Brian is pronounced slice it's like I
don't care there was this sis cooler
that was kind of like it was really
cheap of $12 or something and it looked
really cool I think that'd be good in a
mini ITX PC where you just got to stock
cooler or you've got a CPU that doesn't
overclock and then also there was this
keyboard from real force that had
anything that said it had a polling rate
of two and a half thousand Hertz to five
thousand Hertz
now I know it's practically useless but
it's always cool to just see these new
things and go and get refreshed there's
also 144 Hertz ultrawide monitor that
was hitting the shelves from LG and also
if you thought RGB was just getting too
much I think lepers now releasing like
these choppa fans with all these fancy
LED effects going through so expect the
invasion of that pretty soon so now I
went into Tokyo expecting to get like
some good used deals and I did get that
GTX 670 but really when we compare that
to the new 1050 Ti it's not even half
the price and it doesn't even perform as
well not to mention it's old it's used
so I was kind of like surprised the new
deals in Akihabara were much better than
the used deals now of course we're going
to go in part two the second video I do
we're going to be hunting the country
where they're the real deals we're going
to get the real deals out there so I
can't wait for that but also on that
note I'm going to
be building a mini ITX PC in Japan this
will be my editing workstation for
traveling and it's good to see AMD back
in the game where they're a viable
option now for pretty much everything in
PC so it's great the competitions back
I'm loving the new Rison 5 1600 is the
best CPU man I knew the CPU would be the
goldmine of the whole lot Rison 3 review
will be coming soon - stay tuned for
that I'm going to be comparing that
mainly against the G 45 60 because I
think that's where it's going to be the
focal point of that you know overclock
that because it can be overclocked and
then see how it compares and the thing
is it's getting cheaper so you're gonna
have to sort of couple it up with
cheaper graphics cards I think that's
the idea of rising 3 because if you've
got more money again I agree with a lot
of other people if you've got that
little bit extra money step it up to
that Verizon v 1600 because you won't
regret it and one thing that blew me
away as well was at soft map they now
accept bitcoins as a legitimate source
of payment for computer parts so if
you've got a cryptocurrency and you
exchange for bitcoins you can then use
those bitcoins to buy PC parts that was
really like I don't know if it's scary
if it's really cool but then like
cryptocurrencies are gaining traction I
mean it has taken them a long time in my
opinion but they are gaining traction to
the point where you can legitimately buy
things from stores now
at least in Japan anyways I think
Bitcoin is now officially recognized as
a currency in Japan so also with Japan
they've got some really cool cases now
this is the Ragin tech I couldn't resist
this is all metal construction look how
small it is Mini ITX case I absolutely
love it USB 3 as well love the design of
this case I couldn't resist originally I
was going to go get a case from John's
boat called the RM 2 now if you guys saw
my video on the big mini concept over a
year ago it's pretty much identical to
that just it looks a lot better and so I
was really surprised like damn I want to
get this case but then I saw this one
and I just had to pick up this so
there's definitely some really cool
cases on display in Japan and if you
guys want to build a full-sized ATX case
that's really small and you probably
travel with it then definitely John's
though looking like they're coming into
the competition pretty hard so I love
coming to Japan checking out all the
products because you get to see what's
hot at the moment and what
not any guys that's enough of me talking
if you enjoyed this video be sure to hit
that like button also if you have any
requests when I'm out on the road
hunting then be sure to drop a comma in
the comment section below and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye
so so another cool thing about Japan's
you just drink literally anywhere like
alcohol and you can get it so cheap at
the convenience stores just walk in
there grab a beer and cheers guys
plus and one of the places is right
behind me it's called skimmers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
