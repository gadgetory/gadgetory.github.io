coming to you guys today with a look at
as rocks latest refresh on their x99
motherboard this is the Tai Chi which is
essentially and cosmetically overhauled
motherboard from Azeroth coming in a
very aggressive price point so let's
have a look at the features and then
I'll do some tests for you guys and give
you my personal opinion on this board
though straight away getting straight
into the cosmedix of this board which
will probably be the first thing you
guys have noticed they've gone with a
black and white themed clockwork sort of
steampunk look here and I must say that
paid very particular attention to detail
here with even things like the
input/output shield having those same
markings there and even the screw holes
having those similar markings there as
well now one thing I will say is kudos
to asrock for changing those clips there
and making them the same color as the
DIMM slots so in terms of cosmetics I
think this board is a real hit they
straight away getting into the power
delivery we've got a 12 phase design
here with eight phases dedicated to the
CPU and then two phases dedicated to
each of those four dimm slots on either
side now there is a black heatsink with
X 99 branding covering that power
delivery and I noticed that in practice
when I started overclocking with pretty
aggressive overclocks on air the vrm
temps did get a little bit hot I managed
to get in after about two hours of
running a benchmark there on the CPU at
about 55 degrees so a little on the high
side though just above that you've got
your 8 pin connector and then to the
side you got your 24 pin connector and
in between there you've got your fan
connectors now this board has a total of
five different fan connectors there and
one of them up the top there being
dedicated to water pumps providing an
additional two amps and 24 watts of
power as opposed to the one amp 12 watt
power for Cingular fans moving down the
board you've got two USB front out then
you've got 10 SATA connections there and
also an additional sadr Express
connector moving on to the MDOT two
configurations we've got two of those
one conveniently located in the middle
of the board and then one down the
bottom right now both these connectors
will fit up to five different
configurations of MDOT two and different
sizes then moving down the board there
you've got your doctor debug led as well
as a comport header or TPM header and as
well as a power LED and speaker header
as well as your front audio out and also
your front two USB ports there there's
also a bias selection switch down the
bottom which allows you to select
between two different biases if you had
a bad update or if you just want to test
out a new bias to see if it fixes your
problem
then moving on to the left side of the
board there we've got that armor they're
covering the purity sound three which is
as rocks implementation of the realtek
LC 1150 audio codec now there's good
thing about this is they put good amps
on not only the audio out there which is
a Texas Instruments any five five three
two headphone amplifier but they've also
put in a decent amp on the mic in so
I'll let you guys quickly listen to that
so here's a little test for you guys on
the x99 taichi mic import here with a
volume level of 50 at 20 DB boost here
this is my sweet spot generally for
motherboard onboard audio so you can
tell the asrock actually has a really
decent mic in port so if you were using
it for streaming or whatnot or even just
want good clarity and games then this
mic input is definitely going to deliver
that and the microphone I am using is
the V mode of boom Pro crosstalk was
also extremely low on this motherboard
and also when I was listening to music
with my v motor headphones I noticed the
separation was really good and is pretty
much as good as it gets for onboard
audio and then glancing over the center
of the motherboard that we got that
clockwork theme as well as 5 PCI Express
ports there two of those being one speed
and three of those being 16 speed the 16
speed ports there do have the steel
reinforced armor as as where I call it I
think it's more of a cosmetic thing as
I've never busted a PCIe port due to
savagery and believe me I'm a savage
when it comes to handling PC parts
though depending on your CPU and the
PCIe leans available there you will be
able to do either x16 x16 or x8 x8 x8
then moving on to the side of the
motherboard there we've got two USB 2's
appears to point them below that you've
got a dual band wireless there which
actually works really well in practice
below that you've got your clear CMOS
button USB 3.1 a and C connectors then
below you've got an additional three USB
3 ports and an additional USB 2 port all
connected to those dual Intel ni C's
there which are the two one atvs and
then below that you've got your 7.1
Audio HD connections there which also
has an optical out so let's take a look
at what I like and don't like about the
taichi now moving straight into the boss
I will give kudos here to asrock for
bringing that clockwork theme into the
boss and also having a simple setup
there if you're new to overclock and you
can lock in and easy overclock you got
all your settings on one page so if you
hit f6
you change to Advanced Mode where this
is what
used to and you just got all your
settings there you can tweak voltages
change different over clocks change the
PCI Express to the beer clock clock
ratio there and you can even update the
bias itself within the bios if you just
have an internet connection from a
router it'll download the firmware and
then i'll do the rest for you and then
you've also got the fantastic tuner
there which allows you to tweak all your
different fans that are connected to the
motherboard and change the speeds of
those if they are TPM connections there
how about the actual overclocks that
this motherboard was able to obtain well
with my 5820k i had the extreme 6
previously here that got 4.5 gigahertz
this was no different it scored another
4.5 gigahertz overclock stable there so
very good motherboard for overclocking
pretty solid though as I mentioned
before those vrm temperatures we're a
little bit high especially for 24/7 use
and this was in a 25-degree controlled
environment here also as I said before
those crosstalk levels in the making on
the sound there is really good then
you've got those dual intel n ICS which
work really well in practice and then
besides that you've really got not a lot
to not like about this motherboard also
other things here you've just got so
much expandability on this motherboard
and i think it comes in at $219 so the
only graph that I had with this
motherboard was that it was missing a
power button which I'm kind of used to
since I use it in a lot of test bed
scenario setups so I'd like to see them
add that though really isn't a big
winning and losing point of this
motherboard since a lot of people are
going to be putting these in cases and I
will say the cosmetics is an absolutely
hit out of the park here I love what
asrock have done with this motherboard
now I believe it is coming in at 219
u.s. MSRP which is incredible
considering the feature set you're
getting on this motherboard as well as
the fact that they've added in things
like Wireless and they haven't gone with
fancy RGB LEDs and making you guys pay
for it while skimping on things like
sound so in conclusion asrock are just
getting it right they're hitting home
runs when it comes to motherboards
nowadays they know what people want and
that is a really solid motherboard also
one thing I forgot to mention was the
motherboard itself actually feels really
damn solid and really sturdy I think
they've gone with an eighth layer PCB
design here so very good job with asrock
and I can highly recommend this
motherboard for someone looking for not
only in sort of the best motherboard a
nice
use out there but also someone looking
for the best value for money don't you
guys that's about it for me if you like
these videos and be sure to give it a
big thumbs up if you have any questions
or comments about the Azeroth taichi
then be sure to drop a comment in the
comment section below and I'll get back
to you as soon as I can and yeah this
thing is definitely going to be making
its way into a build very soon and also
I was provided this as a review sample
from asrock if there is any ambiguity in
the air out there then I hope that
clears it off there is hope to see you
another take video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
