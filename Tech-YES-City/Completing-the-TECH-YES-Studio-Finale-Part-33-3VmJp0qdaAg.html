here it is finally complete at least to
the stage where I can now work here and
I gotta say before we get on to this
video big thank you to all you guys have
watched the videos hit that like button
support the channel and also a special
thank you to the patron viewers as well
this is what I've been working so hard
for in the last year to complete and
just get everything ready and here it
finally is the new studio and the
content is now going to be coming out in
mass so get your sub boxes ready but
this is the massive vlog of completing
the studio so let's get on with it
what about detective sent in today is
the final vlog for the construction of
the new tech yes studio and we've got to
essentially lay all the carpet down and
then install the desks get all the
hardware down here and set everything up
so this is going to be quite a bit of
work still to go but I'm sure you guys
just want to see us get into it and
start finishing this thing off so this
hole here it has to be filled up with
mortar and the outsides we've got to
drop a bucket of water on that just to
make sure there's no more leaks coming
in and then we are ready to lay the
carpet
so now behind me this little concrete
room and we've actually cleaned all this
out and I put four little shelves in
here that are already lying around so
I'm gonna put a lot of products in there
that sort of don't really get used that
much but I could use them if I need to
do a build or if I just need products
that I'm searching for from time to time
so they'll be like this will be like a
storage room for all the stuff that
rarely gets used but let's get the
streaming desk down you know we're gonna
be using two 24 inch monitors on this
monitor arm and a 32 inch IPS monitor
for the subject so when we're
live-streaming since the co-host of
course is not going to be anywhere near
me we're gonna have to sort of make do
and now I know Gordon from PC world uses
a monitor for their subject on their
live show and they've got an extremely
good channel so this monitor here is
going to be awesome
once we set that up along with these two
thank you monitors
so there it is that's the basic look of
the stream desk obviously lighting has
to get a bit of improvement because I'm
only using the top lights there and
they're in a weird configuration as it
is but that's what's gonna look like
you're gonna have the subject on the
right and then you're gonna have the two
monitors where I'm got all the details
for the stream and then I'll be just in
that spot there so there it is guys
stream set up all ready to go I just got
to of course connect all the monitors up
to the rig and then decorate the
background with some sound tiles and the
YouTube silver play button too so also
another thing that you guys notice from
a previous vlog was this view behind me
and yes it is absolutely gorgeous we
live about 15 minutes out from town on a
like a peak mountain and yeah it's just
so nice up here it's really peaceful and
quiet and of course the view is really
beautiful I'll let you guys take a quick
look
so when he is kind of like gonna be a
storage room a little bit of storage we
actually had to pull out a heap of wood
and you can maybe even see it at the end
there
the wood was like stuck to the concrete
dad man forgot to pull this out so that
was a massive mission pulling all that
out in itself and we actually damaged
the walls inside here doing so like so
now it's time to build the little shelf
cabinet for this area here and we got
this from office works for about 240
Ozzie dollars so let's build this and
get on with the show
last night
cuz I couldn't close my eyes and see you
I drove myself crazy singing you take my
wildest dreams and tear them all to the
ground
to destroy
so there we have it that's the shelf now
the white shelf with the white drawer is
in there and that's gonna be really cool
now for organization oh yeah and we've
got the two power points on the right
they're just fitting absolutely fine so
I'll probably be getting to six outlet
boards and then have total of 12 that'll
be for all the camera battery charges
and everything else that sort of utility
brought him out
so we set up the TV over there it is all
done it just needs a little bit more
work just especially underneath the TV I
need to raise it a little bit so I'll
probably get some foam tiles just for
that and then probably put a sound bar
run from Labbit
so now next up here we've got tables we
picked this up off gum tree for ten
bucks
it's got like black and red legs it's a
really weird color so I actually have a
bottle of white spray paint that I never
used in a previous video I think I was
gonna spray some heatsinks up so I'll
use that and this will be the bench for
outside here
for when I do the outside b-roll so I
need a camera for outside and that'll be
the one where I can get the shots and if
it gets weathered it's ten dollars so it
really doesn't matter if it gets beaten
up but another desk we've got here is
this one here we picked this up off gum
tree for a hundred and eighty strand
dollars absolutely crazy good deal
because the wood itself is so nice this
is gonna be a really good sort of build
desk it's really sturdy and it's a
really cool pattern for building I think
so one problem with it though is of the
hide it only goes up to around 60
centimeters so I do want to raise it
about 20 centimeters so I'll have to put
wood underneath the legs and that'll
also help but not eat into the carpet so
much because it kind of does have metal
sharp legs there and then on top we can
put another piece of wood and that
should raise it up 200 mil and give us
about that 800 perfect height for
building I think
alright so there's the b-roll table
there it's a little bit dark it's
actually overcast at the moment and
there's a guy outside with the lawn
mower as well so I'm just shooting
quickly inside but yeah ten dollars guys
and that's gonna be shooting products
outside you can still see it's a little
bit wet but that'll be for the outside
product shoots and if the desk gets
damaged from weather outside then again
ten dollars it's nothing to lose really
so here's the build desk it is now
complete and this is where the b-roll
and also the building of computers and
everything else in between is going to
be conducted so maybe let's just take a
bit of b-roll of this course
a57 TX that has no panels on it at all
and see how that turns out
so now here's the new tech yes so far we
got this on a deal though asking around
14-hundred australia for it
I dropped him down at bargain and down
to 1200 baby this has got a chaise in it
but the good thing about the chase is it
acts like a bed on this sofa so I'll be
able to sleep down here when I'm doing
those busy nights if it's benchmarking
new products or whatever I'm just so
tired
I'll just crash out on that yes so far
and then get back to work
so there's a couch there it is looking
mighty fine I the exact positioning I'm
still gonna think about all that it does
look a little bit awkward in the
position the TV's not Center and it's
really close to that wall and there's no
real sort of exact entrance etiquette
desk
so there we have it there's the two
shelves done and I don't know if I'm
going to move them over a little bit to
the left and then have maybe a filing
cabinet to the right and then move these
couches a little bit away from that door
but here is the big mess so far like
damn all these boxes but the good thing
is now that these shelves are done I can
now put all those products sitting over
there the motherboards on this shelf
here because inside here we've got a
heap of products still so there's a few
products there and that's they're all in
the shelves so lots of different things
in there and it's pretty dark so and
there's actually no light in here at the
moment either so still gonna put a light
inside this little storage room but
still it's holding all the products so
here we are early morning and we've got
the sound tiles now so today I wanted to
put up some of these sound tiles on the
walls but I might just start with this
red pod in the background there first
and then after that I'll probably put
the ones on the roots the white ones but
the black tiles are really thick they're
actually really nice quality the one
upstairs the white ones they feel really
thin and flimsy so I mean technically
they should all work really well for
reducing echo and reverb but in terms of
our the better panel to touch and feel
these black ones definitely a thick and
they definitely feel a lot better then
there's white ones but any what we're
gonna do here is stick some cardboard to
stripes of cardboard on each of these
and then after that we can put the
double sided tape on those two stripes
of cardboard and this will allow us to
stick it to the walls where we want it
and of course get the sound tiles not
falling off the wall
so there's a black sound tiles they're
absolutely phenomenal good quality I'll
put the link in the description below
for those cuz they're really good that
was a good buy these white ones here
however I I'm getting nervous about them
because you see some of them will need a
Wilder shape and I'm actually worried
that they might not even shape like full
you know might become a full flat square
so I can actually stick them on the roof
so I mean I'll give these a day if they
don't shape properly within a day I'm
gonna get pretty angry and this one here
as well this one became pre yellowed I
don't know how that happened but some
people were warning me about the white
sound tiles becoming yellow in the
comment section but I figured because I
was going to put them on a roof they
really wouldn't see hardly any sunlight
at all at least the rack sunlight and so
I think they should be fine on the roof
but again we've got those previous
problems that I mentioned and that is if
they'll even shape so we'll come back to
these
so here's the course at t1 race and I've
had this for a while now and I requested
the white and black one it looks really
nice in my opinion and also it is super
comfortable of course the downside being
that is actually quite expensive for a
chair
however on that note it is just really
comfortable I'd say out of all the
gaming chairs I've tried for a guy like
me five foot ten
this thing just melds into you it is
extremely comfortable I'd say if you
about six foot one and under this chairs
gonna be really nice for you if you're a
really tall guy if you're a beast and
you're feasting all the time like six
foot four this chair is probably too
small for you that if it's super
comfortable this lumbar support here is
working really well too
it's just it's a really nice chair
really easy to set up and also sorry to
call Sarah as well they sent this chair
out a while ago to me and it just took
me a long time I was just moving houses
and now obviously moving down to the
studio and also I feel like I wasn't
worthy of this chairs just so good I
mean working out of a shoe box that just
didn't do this chair justice but now in
the new studio this chair is gonna be
the main bread and butter for when I'm
editing videos well actually a Premiere
Pro on the main editing week is gonna be
the bread and butter for that but this
thing's going to be awesome support
so here is now the build desk this is
gonna be huge I think about five meters
in total this will allow me to have an
edit rig two different benchmark rigs
and of course things like the PC build
of the month can go on the end here so
the problem we've had we've put all the
brackets on that was pretty
straightforward but the problem we had
was the walls not perfectly flush so
we've had to like literally cut so many
cuts this way and this way to sort of
give it a slightly odd angle so
everything will be flush in the ends so
that is this coming along now now also
the sound tiles we've got three of them
just as a test subject setup and there
they're working really well so we're
gonna put decorations in the middle of
all three of that but the black ones as
I said before they're really good the
white ones are sort of sort of coming to
take shape but I mean I'm just really
the black sound tiles these ones here
they're just so much better I recommend
buying these over those the pattern you
see on those white ones they just
there's white ones are so flimsy like
they're just mistakes and also here
we've got the speaker's set up in all
four corners of the room and they are
looking pretty good they just fit
especially this one up here just managed
to fit you can proceed a little bit
speaker wire hanging out there and we've
got the last piece here the base unit
and the amp that'll go down there just
underneath the table and the center
speaker will go right there still gonna
figure out how to hook up the center
speaker I'm probably gonna do that last
as I'm not sure where the main I think
the main build the MA editing station
will go here with the NASS beside it and
I'm just gonna see how it all works out
so I can get my center speaker flush
with where I'm gonna be sitting so now
we're just outside doing some
woodworking here on the ten dollar desk
this thing is actually coming more handy
than I thought it ever would so we're
using it as like a work desk outside so
all the
debris doesn't fly back in but here it
is here right now we're gonna put some
holes underneath the desk to connect all
the three pieces of wood together so
that can sit flush and then give us that
final screw off okay so we can finally
fit the desk and of course move those
pcs down so here it is guys phase one of
the tackiest studio is now complete
we've got the deaths in five meter
editing desk I even managed to have some
spares left over for another standing
desk so there's just a lot more things
now to give you guys better content keep
delivering the content and also we still
have to do a bit of work like I'm pretty
sure I'll be putting sound tiles up
there and then above that another shelf
but that's all in due time I can now
bring my computer down here but before
we do that I have to start cleaning up
because there's actually a big mess here
and also gonna say thank you to two
special people as well who have helped
us with this studio so first up we've
got dad man you guys probably seen him
on the channel a lot before do you have
anything you have to say to the viewers
this took us over a good week to
complete pretty much like from stuff
from the last face from the pot 2.5 so
we've done a lot of work we spend a lot
of hours in this studio it's now
complete and we've got it so big thank
you to dad man he's the best
I'll give him a big kiss - well next up
we got shan AKA shan for the fam
do you have anything you have to say to
the viewers before we go
so here it is guys right behind me the
new tech yes studio is complete at least
the initial stage and it costs all up
about sixteen thousand dollars so far so
that's from empty concrete filthy room
to what you see behind me all the
shelves and desks and couches everything
included so davon and I together we've
saved a lot of money on this studio it's
been huge
I'd say easily like twenty thousand
dollars if you had to pay everyone to
come in go do the stuff set everything
up so I guess that's what it's all about
taking a city the hustle and it's not
just on the job as well it's behind the
scenes as well - always hustling always
getting the best deals and even on parts
in this studio as well I got the best
deals - so some more things that have to
go down with the studio of course I've
ordered some aircon in I've got a deal
on that as well 7.1 kilowatt panasonic
air conditioner got a deal on that got
to get it installed and some blinds as
well vertical blinds because the
vertical blinds allow you to control the
light so I'll need that as I love using
sunlight in the shots but let me know in
the comment section below what you think
of the new see if there's any ideas you
want to see happen because there's gonna
be a lot of transforming going on with
this place in the next couple of months
- this is only the preliminary blueprint
of what's gonna happen with the studio
but basically guys
gaze up box is ready because this is
gonna be a lot of content coming to you
guys in the next few months or 2018 is
gonna be crazy and I'll catch you all in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
so now a quick walk through the studios
got some cases are going to use soon
very soon got the LG OLED TV got the
couch for that these are foam that tiles
they actually kind of are after two days
they're sort of starting to form so I
guess I'll give them another two days
and see if they can flatten out like
some of them have kind of flattened out
well so we'll give them a chance
except that yellow one there that's like
been worthy already then we've got here
the shelves so got a lot of used
motherboards this will be in an episode
of can yes fix it as well look forward
to giving you guys that just so many
cool things I'm going to use of course
the EVGA x58 that is going to be in a
build as well custom build all these
promises as well they're all going to be
fulfilled so stay tuned that's the
shelves of that's the Shelf of promises
pretty much and then we've got here of
course there's a beautiful view out
there and there's two sliding doors for
the view got the build desk of course we
built this for a massive deal that was
crazy and we've got the standing desk
got that super cheap as well all the
sound tiles she got them under deal as
well so just deals disease got set up
here this is what I'm gonna be working
off until I decide where the actual
monitor arms are gonna go on the wall so
I'm gonna be wall mounting to 34 inch
monitors and then over there will be the
benchmark rigs and then of course PC of
the month build over there go the
surround sound set up it sounds
absolutely amazing when I do a studio
tour when I'm when I finished this
studio like there's lots more plans here
I'll give you guys a studio tour and let
you hear what this sound system sounds
like but it's pretty much a nightclub in
this small area here and I had surround
sound in Japan it sounds really awesome
too so over your stream desk I'm
thinking after initially setting this up
this monitor here I'll probably downsize
to like a 24 inch monitor because the 32
inch monitor doesn't go well on this
desk so sound tiles of the back
decorating over here organizations shed
there it is there all the stuffs pretty
much been filled already but at least
now I'm really organized
I've even got little labels on the
drawers as well so that's organization
101 and that's the whole studio guys
that's pretty much
ready to go no we can't forget about the
$10 bill desk
even though Dedmon did take a big chunk
out of it already sir I think this desk
actually saved his whole hand because
when he was chopping the blade went up
and probably wasn't for this desk you
might have chopped his hand off so $10
desk guys never give up on it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
