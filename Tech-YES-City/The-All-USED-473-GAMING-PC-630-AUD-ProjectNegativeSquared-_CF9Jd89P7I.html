csgo dota to a really high frame rates
not just for competitive gamers but can
also play some of the later titles of
course GTA 5 and mafia 3 as well very
playable on this rig so let's take a
look at what we've got welcome back to
tech city and this month PC is one
that's been put together with all use
parts so we're not doing that news meets
you or anything like that this month is
a special one and it's also very special
because man I had a heap of different
problems this month from the memory to
the motherboard to the CPU to the GPU
and I just got there in the end but as
we go along we'll talk about some of the
problems with with that said let's take
a look at all the prices of the
components then we'll do the build and
then the benchmarks
you
so usually when I do my PC builds I make
sure that all the components are usually
working off camera but this actual piece
of hardware the all the combination here
had so many problems first of all the
motherboard the actual two out of memory
slots won't work at all with any memory
in them even if the memory modules are
perfectly working so the motherboard had
a problem to begin with and then I
actually had three different memory
modules here from the swap that didn't
work at all either so these three are
bricked memory modules so essentially at
the moment I've got two different eight
gigabyte memory modules in tandem and I
mean I just hopefully I can get the best
out of all this so we've got memory
problems and motherboard problems but in
the end this whole thing is still
working the graphics card boots up the
motherboards working with the CPU so now
we can put together the build
all the things that have changed me
internally
Hill
so that we have a guys all those games
in those benchmarks are running a really
good frame rate of 1080p high which is
where I like to have my settings
generally even at any resolution high
gives you that really good frame rate
for the performance however I did notice
mafia 3 ran terribly I had to drop that
down to low settings and then we got
around 60 fps in that game though I will
say that game runs like pretty much off
on any configuration that I know of at
least speaking to everyone else in the
TAC scene they say that this game is
extremely hard to run so mafia 3 kind of
an outlier there but this machine man
have managed to go up to 4.8 gigahertz
even though I did have to turn it down
after the benchmarks just because it's
really not a healthy overclock to be
running 24/7 the graphics card that
managed to get up to one point one
gigahertz however at this 290x is so
damn hot I was really surprised at how
hot this thing is I mean the even the
Excel or that I put on there was
starting to cap out and I've never seen
a graphics card cap out in Excel or
cooler this thing's got three fans on it
the fan speeds were ramped up and this
thing's still making the temperatures
rise so I could only imagine how much
the thermal throttling would happen on
the stock cooler which is really the
same cooler as a 7970 cooler and the 290
X's just has a massive die on there and
it puts out a lot more power than a 79
70 so you guys might be wondering a
little bit more about those problems
that we had on the way I mean the memory
man that just didn't work some of those
sticks that I got traded actually the
majority of those sticks didn't work I
only managed to find two sticks in the
end that did work and put them together
on a motherboard which had two dead DIMM
slots and for the CPU anything other
than the stock settings were just
thermal throttling which I was really
surprised with I managed to get it up to
four point five gigahertz but then it
was thermal throttling and then my D
lead kit that was worn out like I've
actually got to put in a dispute for
that because the things broken after two
D lids and I can't even use it anymore
so I quickly went down my hardware store
just said hey can I take a look at your
vices and test them out and they said
sure so I quickly deleted the CPU down a
warehouse which was pretty cool it did
do the job and then we got that working
the temperatures were phenomenally low
on the CPU after I deal it at the same
four point five gigahertz I believe the
temperatures dropped a good 40 degrees
which is incredible so if you guys
haven't deal with it already then some
of these CPUs I highly recommend
deleting them if you want to overclock
and then moving on with the problems
list the cables didn't extend far enough
from the power supply so I decided to
throw in some extensions I had lying
around I've had these for actually quite
some time they're not as good as the
game of chief extensions and so I
decided to use them and spice up the
build in the process but anyway in the
end everything just worked out I mean if
it didn't I would be a lot more angrier
so we do have a build that works even
though the motherboard and the memory a
lot of that memory didn't work so I was
really surprised but we got there in the
end and we now have a build that plays
games really damn well which I'm glad
I'm proud of but with that said it was a
long time and it was a very tedious
process so I hope you guys enjoyed this
one if you have any questions or
comments and be sure to drop a comment
the comment section below about this rig
I don't even know what to call it I
might be thinking of a name for it maybe
the scraper by era
yes I don't know something crazy but let
me know in the comment section below and
I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
