70 basically the 2000 series cards
codenamed cheering from Nvidia you guys
wanted me to go deep and today we will
be going pretty deep I'll be splitting
this into three parts in fact as I am
still in the dark about any insight
information myself so I only know as
much as anyone else out there
given the current information we have at
this moment so these cards were
announced in Germany just this Monday
and after that there has been a big
storm about the whole pre-ordering and
really what has been displayed or put
out there so far with performance anyway
today's video let's talk about
performance the first thing the most
important topic for a gamer the biggest
question on display here how will these
new cards perform well to be blunt I
believe these cards will perform quite a
lot faster than the previous series that
is these will be much more than a
refresh Turing is a new architecture at
the core and also benefits from a node
trend going from 16 nanometer to 12
nanometer plus from Pascal deterring
royal gains in current titles are
looking like they will see a boost of
roughly 30 to 50 percent over their
previous predecessor and here is where
things get tricky as in video themselves
have shown a slide showing such
performance gains but have also released
data in the way of how the cause inside
the r-tx series itself works now
utilizing one Nvidia calls tensor cause
with the technology called DL SS or deep
learning super sampling this essentially
is a smart AI that helps smooth an image
and hence the Laois for a greater
performance gains in terms of frames per
second and at least with the LS s
enabled some games are reported to be
achieving over double the FPS over the
previous 1000 series counterparts
impressive if they can achieve this in
popular multiplayer titles and also RPGs
though how many titles will mass adopt
this technology and also what about
titles like the recently released World
of Warcraft expansion are they going to
utilize the new RT x series to its full
potential this remains to be seen
of course with these kind of sudden
performance gains being announced and
yes we have waited over two years for
the 2000 series cards of course comes an
increase in price and we will talk about
this more in depth
part three but basically they now
currently have these cards listed in at
1200 USD for a pre-order for a r-tx 20
ATT I found this Edition comes with a
285 watt TDP 18 point six billion
transistors over one of the biggest dies
implemented on a consumer greatest card
in date and also a new custom dual blade
fan cooler which honestly looks pretty
clean
I'll leave the final judgment of course
until I see one outside of the matrix
though I believe it's 1980 here in the
magical land of Australia and viddy have
stated this card will be released on
September 20th which is when the
founders cards themselves will be
released and they'll be available from
$1,000 from the board partners that this
is a starting from price as well that's
guys like a Zeus EVGA galaxies etc so we
don't actually know how much the 20 atti
variants from the board partners will
cost exactly but they also have the RT x
2080 with an $800 pre-order price tag
and from $700 retail pricing off to
September 20th and the RT X 2070 which
is yet to have its release date
confirmed though speculation has it at
sometime late October and that will have
a preorder price of $600 and from retail
pricing of $500 so ultimately this is a
significant boost in pricing to what we
are used to having seen on a flagship TI
single dice solution however we have
4352 cuda cores on the RT x 20 ati up
over 20% over the 1080 TI's 3584 calls
and 29:44 cores on the r TX 2080 up over
15% over the gtx 1080s to 560 and lastly
2,304 on the RTS 2070 up over 20% over
the gtx 1070 to nineteen hundred and
twenty cause though it is important to
note that we can't compare these core
counts directly as an indicator
performance since they are a newer
architecture they will most likely be
more efficient in that the amount of
compute power available per core is more
than that of the previous 1000 series
cards though four clock speeds they look
to be roughly around the same levels
though one interesting observation this
time around is that the founders cards
will actually have an increase in speeds
over
of the board partner cards perhaps
enticing people to buy directly from
Nvidia rather than going through the
retail board partners like azuz etc the
last important feature to note is that
the RT X cars will now use GDR 6 which
has significantly more data throughput
available then either gddr5 and also 5x
so memory bandwidth per se shouldn't be
a problem so how well do these cards
ultimately perform well this also segues
into part 2 and that leads us into
marketing much higher prices than what
we are used to and also why the name
changing from GTX to party X well to
answer that first question and also why
I believe will have a much higher
performing card this time around than
the previous generation is that firstly
because there are many points it creates
new value in a market where there
otherwise was none essentially Nvidia is
creating a new market for themselves and
also for the consumer and this is in
itself I believe is the reason for the
name change to RTX from GTX if they had
a cold at the GTX 20/80 for example then
people would think it's nothing more
than just the performance boost so this
way RTX allows the opportunity for
people to research what is different and
in ways allows in video automatically to
justify the higher price tag whilst
people are researching this brand new
card Nvidia is ultimately showcasing
their new technologies and getting free
marketing and what I believe will be
high performance for rural gamers though
why the new market I thought about this
last night quite a lot and it struck me
almost like gaben had come down from the
heavens and showed me the light now this
is only my opinion but I believe this
series of gravis cards was actually a
contingency plan enacted in case of a
flailing cryptocurrency demand which for
NVIDIA I believe we have seen a worse
case scenario that could have happened
with GPU mining literally falling flat
within the span of a few months not only
do they have a lot of 1000 series cards
still on hand but they also have to
compete with disgruntled miners that
bought tens hundreds and even thousands
of cards at a time that no longer have a
need for these gaming graphics cards and
hence can't compete with the ramped up
of a Sigma's so they are selling these
cards in an attempt to recoup some of
the money they initially outlaid
so the r-tx series as a contingency plan
for cryptocurrency catastrophe actually
makes a whole lot of sense at least to
me it goes above the whole field and
also allows people who can't afford the
new 2000 series cards to seriously
consider the now lower priced 1000
series cards so Nvidia have clearly
accounted for this and now have in place
what I would call a great business plan
one that enables them to dominate
however let's move on to part three the
big one should you preorder and I'm
gonna preface this firstly by saying you
can do what you want to do with your
money ultimately it's your decision I'm
not gonna tell you what you can and
can't do though I will give you as my
thoughts and opinions and of course
there are certainly a lot of foreign
against type arguments here though let
me say the against verse so I don't call
much hate in the comments we don't know
how much the performance of these cards
is exactly just yet we've only seen a
graph and some fancy demos and the
enthusiasts performance numbers we
wanted to see were very vague and we
don't have a direct comparison per se to
the GTX 1000 series cards you know the
direct apples to apples screen
comparisons that even amateurs with
bandicam know how to cap for their first
time I'd like to see some solid
performance figures and more
side-by-side comparisons of the cards
with FPS numbers at the same settings
across a variety of resolutions before
pre-ordering a product though this is
now the for I would hazard a guess that
Nvidia is going to deliver why well it
comes back to the name itself Nvidia
Jensen loves his company it's not just a
company to him it is his Rockstar child
he wouldn't put a product in a position
where it is not going to impress that
would lose loyalty that would hurt
people on a personal and financial level
and that could potentially make a burn
that could leave scarring nvidia does
not want this and hence this is why i
believe ultimately the RT x 2006 cards
will deliver but lastly what if you are
the guy wants to preorder one of these
cards
I mean honestly so what I know guys that
waste tens of thousands of dollars
modding cars
what's $1200 for something that is going
to give you months and possibly years of
entertainment and in my opinion some of
the best entertainment you can get
that's coming from a PC gamer that is a
service that no one really puts a price
tag on and what is that extra
performance extra features and
ultimately
experience going to mean to you is it
worth $1200 is it worth $800 is it worth
$600 is it less is it more well that's
up for you to decide not for me I'm not
gonna tell you what you can and can't do
with your money
so if pre-ordering is the thing that you
want to do then go ahead and go get
yourself one of course me personally I
would wait just to see the exact
performance figures I believe these
cards even if you miss out on day one
with a pre-order that sold out you'll
still be able to get one in a month's
time but regardless of that I will have
day one coverage for you guys here on
the tech yeah City channel so stay tuned
don't forget to hit that like button if
you enjoyed today's video also let me
know in the comments section below do
you think in videos going to deliver
with the 2000 series also what do you
think this whole pitch is about love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
