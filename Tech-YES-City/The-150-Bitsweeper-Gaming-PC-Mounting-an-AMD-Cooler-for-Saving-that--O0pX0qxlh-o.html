gonna be putting together a PC for a
hundred and fifty bucks or if you're in
Australia two hundred Australian dollars
roughly and we're gonna see if we can
play the new title
Kingdom Come deliverance so what we've
got here is a seventy eight fifty now we
pick this up on a deal from cash
converters a twenty five bucks we've got
here the Aliexpress X thirty four thirty
now these CPUs are so cheap they're four
cores four threads and you can see here
I've delivered this now these are the
first gen I five seven 50s so I didn't
even know that you could deal live these
things so I'm gonna see if the
temperatures here today are actually
pretty good now you may notice there is
an AMD cooler here on the table because
I'm gonna attempt to do something pretty
stupid here today might be awesome give
or take and if it works I'll make a
separate video on it but we're gonna try
and mount an AMD cooler to this
motherboard because I kind of don't want
to put a new cooler on which costs
around 30 bucks or so because it'll blow
the budget out a little bit and also I
just think would look really cool if you
could use these handy coolers that come
included with your new Verizon CPUs on
something like this where it would
really make a perfect combination so
also you guys have been telling me the
car from bid wit he made a video where
he went and bought a PC off Craigslist
they used PC for $550 now I'm subscribed
to him i watch the video and yeah he did
overpay big time for that PC so I mean
if it's these first time buying
something off Craigslist then I wish him
luck it's a lot of fun I hope he gets
into the deal hunting thing and soda
joins the already awesome community
there's a lot of youtubers out there and
myself included we do deals hunting we
love hunting use parts and the price
performance it brings to offer but it
does remain to be seen what he will do
with that rig he did hint at the end of
his video that he was going to compare
it to a new PC I just hope he's not
gonna go out and buy like one hundred
and forty dollar gtx 1050 put together a
new PC for a similar price and then say
the new PC so much better because it
wouldn't really be fair to pick up the
cheapest new parts and then compare that
to literally the most expensive used
parts out there but with all that aside
let's take apart this PC here clean all
these parts individually down and then
put it back together overclocked at hope
and get this thing to fit too and yes I
know this thing's upside down I just
don't really know why I haven't bothered
to put it down side up
so we just pulled the motherboard out
it's a little bit dirty we're gonna give
it a clean soon as well as the case but
the cpu in here is an i5 650 now these
were the only generation of i5 desktop
SKUs that had to cause says if you are
swapping it for is the Xeon x34 30 now
this is very similar to the i5 750 it's
got four cores four threads and we'll do
a better job of overclocking especially
after we've deleted it so in the
previous bill we pulled out these two 2
gigabyte sticks of memory and you may
have noticed that we put in a 4 gigabyte
stick well in this bill we're doing the
exact same thing now we're putting in 2
4 gigabyte sticks of memory and taking
out the 2 to you buy sticks and so
essentially what we're doing is we're
not losing any memory out of our stack
we're just changing it around so if we
do come in to a 4 slot motherboard we
can then put a gigabytes of RAM in now
since this only has two slots of memory
we'll go with the two for give us sticks
and that will give it a gigabytes of
memory and make it still able to be
viable for playing the games
so now the motherboard in case they're
already pretty clean Sol's out of
Dewar's give it a quick data vac and now
it's looking really good but now we've
got to put the deleted CPU on but that
needs it clean first you can see I've
only deleted it and this glue is still
around the edges so we're going to take
that off with a plastic card and then
we're going to insert this put the
liquid metal on and see if we can
install that AMD cooler
we wise will use all that excess on this
GPU die here so at least we're not
putting it to waste
this is a put liquid metal on the CPU
die and also the GPU die I'm actually
just gonna test this out to make sure
everything's booting up okay even check
the temperatures in the boss because the
CPU cooler even though it's mounted with
two screws diagonally it is touching the
capacitors so just want to make sure
everything's checking out okay and the
temperatures final the CPU and then
we'll put the whole build together so
we've got the rig booted up it is giving
a signal on the capture card and we're
also in the BIOS here and the
temperatures are looking absolutely fine
so thunderbirds are go
so we're the overclocks working now and
we got the GPU to 1050 megahertz on the
core got the memory overclocked on that
too that's absolutely fine but the CPU
is overheating a little bit more not
throttling yet but it's getting very
close to throttling so that does
indicate that the cooler is maybe even
just like one mill off contacting the
CPU heatsink so we're going to take this
apart and see if we can maybe just do a
quick bang job and bang that side of the
cooler down so it fits over those
capacitors easier
so we've just overclock the CPU and
that's the 3.8 gigahertz gives us the
score of around 450 Cinebench points and
the GPU is also overclocked max on the
sliders with the current bias now the
liquid metal on the GPU die as well is
helping I believe the temperatures on
this particular model it's running
really well you can see in the graphs
it's and this is with a fan profile
that's actually a custom fan profile so
it's not even that loud you can hear
this is about as loud as the system gets
even when it's running games so
impressive for the acoustics but we've
ran the first benchmark here Metro last
light and we've got a score of 59
average FPS with the same settings as
what Carl said he used in his so we do
have the performance that is bidding an
average FPS but we can see there would
the point 1 percent low as you can
automatically see that they're going to
be somewhere around 10 which is actually
quite low so his PC is running a little
bit smoother and if anything I'd
probably have to attribute that to this
hard drive that's in here it is a little
bit slow if there's one thing I would
replace in this system it would be the
hard drive but something that's at least
from 2013 as this hard drive is from
2010 it's a little bit slow with that
aside let's see if this PC behind me can
run Kingdom Come deliverance because it
says the minimum specs are 78 70 but I
believe this machine is overclocked as
it is with that AMD cooler on it could
run this game
so behind me now we've got the rig
actually running Kingdom Come
deliverance is the 720p upscale to 1080p
and it's on low settings but we're
getting over 60 fps in this game and
it's actually really smooth so the below
minimum spec requirements is running
this game absolutely fine well with that
said let's move over to a conclusion now
so there it is guys the $150 PC
everything is out on the table we pulled
this thing apart put it back together
again
with an AMD cooler and keep in mind we
changed all the thermal paste around
about the CPU GPU even dealer to that
CPU and the results in the end were
actually really impressive because we
used a cooler that would otherwise be
sitting around like I said before
collecting dust and we made it work for
us instead of having to go out and buy a
$30 cooler like the cooler master 212 or
the Aliexpress BT g5 we were actually
able to extract the maximum performance
on this motherboard which is the H 55 M
and the X 34 30 because it has a pretty
low multiplier on the CPU over logging
this thing to 3.8 gigahertz is about
only really where you can expect this
thing to go even with a better cooler on
board so the AMD cooler impressed me at
90 degrees it is running a little bit
hot in the benchmarks but in games it's
going around 80 degrees and that's
absolutely fine considering we're just
coming out of summer here and the
ambience are quite high but of course
what about gaming well we did overclock
the GPU and we did put some liquid metal
on there because we put too much on the
CPU and in this case the liquid metal
did a really good job the fans were not
too noisy there on a custom fan profile
but they'll still keeping the graphics
card around about 60 degrees which was
very impressive and the GPU was near
100% all the time and this was on the
max overclocks for the current boss so
it couldn't really get better in terms
of the GPU cooling and also the CPU in
terms of their overclocks they did
really well on both fronts and we did it
on an extremely low budget and when we
contrast that to bit wits computer we
did get performance in Metro last slide
that did beat it on the average FPS the
points and lows in the mumps and lows
we're a little bit
and that's mainly because I think Karl's
machine didn't have an SSD in it so that
would make a difference especially on
this PC where the hard drive is a little
bit slow it can cause problems if
background processes are loading and
causing stuttering especially in those
games but Kingdom Come deliverance that
was extremely smooth I was absolutely
blown away by the performance this is an
latest and greatest title and we're
running at below minimum recommended
specs and we've got it running over
60fps at 1080p now keep in mind it is
upscale from 720p to 1080p but really
none the wiser six or seven year old
hardware it's running this game
absolutely fine
anyway if it's one thing to take out
there's will two things it is first of
all bit wet I look forward to seeing
more content that you're doing on use
price performance there's a whole
community out here it's phenomenal it's
a lot of fun I hope to see you have a
lot of fun with these type of videos
sooo and another thing as well is if you
guys look at these videos when you've
got these neglected parts and I'll put a
link to a build I recently did up here
if you get these parts that people think
are just old and they don't work
properly anymore and you take them and
you extract all the good out of them
then you can really put together
something that just runs the latest
titles absolutely fine with smooth FPS
as we saw that Kingdom Come deliverance
that actually shocked me and how well it
was playing the game so I could have an
enjoyable experience on this thing and I
could do it for 150 bucks anyway guys if
you enjoyed today's video then be sure
to hit that like button if you have any
questions or comments then be sure to
drop them in the comments section below
let me know what you think of that AMD
cooler on the Intel motherboard I guess
I'll have to make a separate video
outline the process of doing that as it
was a bit of a hack and slash method it
didn't take too long but the results
were quite impressive when we compared
it especially to the previous stock
Intel cooler which is much smaller and
much lighter so I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye
anyway the message at the end of the day
I've got a PC here behind me that I can
go on flip and make a couple of hundred
bucks on so man I did it again
too much like this thermal grizzly stuff
it just ah it's like you've got to have
surgeon hands just to pull a little bit
of it out and yes I know this thing's
upside down I just don't know really why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
