where's the PC builds at and today we
have a three hundred and fifty dollar
gaming PC that will be able to play GTA
5 at 1080p so let's get on with it
so with the recent release of GTA 5
causing a huge buzz in the PC world I
thought I'd build you guys a cookie
cutter entry level budget PC for $350
they'll be able to play this game at
1080p on medium to high settings and
it'll do a good job of that so let's
take a look at what's in the cart so for
the CPU we're going with an intel
pentium g 32:58 this thing comes in at
$65 and it is pretty much one of the
best bang for buck CPUs you can get now
the good thing about the CPU is you can
overclock it to around about four gigs
even on the stock cooler so you don't
have to spend money on an aftermarket
cooler another great benefit of this CPU
is that it's got the Haswell
architecture so it's fast and snappy not
only for games that would be great for
an overall good desktop experience the
one drawback of this CPU is it won't be
able to play some of those games that
have a four core requirement that's
where one company's paid off another
company to introduce a four core
requirement even though with a hotfix
the G 32:58 still plays those games
though for what it's worth
GTA 5 will run absolutely fine on this
CPU at 1080p so for the model we're
going with an entry-level H 81 and P 33
motherboard from MSI this board comes in
just a little bit over $40 that will do
a fine job of supporting that G 32:58
and overclocking it and supporting one
graphics card so really good value for
money there so for the memory we're
going with some g.skill one stick of a
gigabytes ddr3 memory that comes clocked
in at 1600 megahertz if you enable the
XMP profile which is really easy to do
now a good thing about this memory is
you've also got the option to use it in
another build in the future if you want
to add another a gigabyte stick you know
16 gigabytes of memory
so there's giving you a little bit of
options anyway let's move on now to the
next part so for the hard drive we're
going with a Hitachi ultra star 750
gigabyte hard drive which comes in at
$40 you've got a lot of storage there at
7200 rpm Drive sort of perform pretty
well and I'll do a good job of holding a
lot of games as well as acting as a
backup drive if you want to use it in a
future project so with the graphics card
this is hands-down the most important
part of the build so you'll want to set
aside the biggest
option of your budget for the graphics
card with that being said we going with
the zotac gtx 750ti
which comes in at around about 130
dollars though this price this card
performs really well it'll do an
absolutely fine job of playing pretty
much any game at 1080p at least on
medium to high settings I've even used
this graphics card at 1440p and it's
done a fine job of playing like heroes
and new earth and league of legends on
Ultra settings at 1440p so for GTA 5 at
1080p this graphics card will do an
absolutely fine job so for the second
last part of the build we're going with
an EVGA 400 watt power supply which will
do an absolutely fine job of powering
these components especially because
we've got a gtx 750ti and a pentium
32:58 they're not going to be requiring
much power anyway so a 400 watt power
supply especially at $24 makes a lot of
sense you can save money for other
things like the graphs card the CPU and
your home and host now the last part of
the build this is going to be a little
bit controversial but at this price
point I believe I this is something that
I would go with personally and that is
for the case we're not going with the
case instead we're just going on eBay
we're going to go buy a power button for
one dollar and then we're going to put
our build on a cardboard box and that's
going to be our rig and I'm no jokes
this is a cookie cutter build you want
to put as much money into your
components as possible so if you need to
get a case then spend an extra twenty
dollars and grab yourself a decent case
though personally me first I'll just
save the money and get no case and put
it towards the things that matter like
the CPU on the graph Scott anyway guys I
hope you enjoyed this budget build if
you did please give it a big thumbs up
if you have any questions or comments
about this 350 dollar monster that we
just built today then please drop a
comment a conversation below and if you
haven't already subscribed attack your
city where there's going to be more tech
videos coming to you also the OSD the
buttons everything on this monitor was
very good until I noticed one big
problem and you guys probably want to
know what that is so we'll get straight
on to it and it's a thing called cross
