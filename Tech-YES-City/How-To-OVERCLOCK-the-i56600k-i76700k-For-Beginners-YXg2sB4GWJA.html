how to overclock your skylake CPU and
I'm going to do this in a megaman shirt
ok so let's get straight on with this
overclocking tutorial and the first
thing you want to do is grab a program
called aida64 now put the link in the
description below and where you can
download this but essentially it's a
program that will allow you to monitor
your voltage and also stress your CPU to
sort of ascertain whether you've got a
stable overclock or not so after you've
got this program and installed it and
got it already you can then click power
and then just restart your computer and
now once you've restarted your computer
upon booting it up you just press the
Delete key or the f2 key depending on
the BIOS or the maker of your
motherboard now something that I will
stress about overclocking is that the
BIOS on my motherboard is the MSI bias
if you've got an asrock motherboard or
in a Zeus model order a gigabyte
motherboard it's going to look a little
bit different to you to what I'm using
but it will have a lot of the same
features whether they just be under
similar names or slightly different
names so once you're in the boss it'll
look like this if you're in the MSI boss
you can then press f7 and that'll change
it to the advanced view this is the view
that I like to use here and so the first
thing you want to go to is overclock and
now there should be a list of options
here so for the purposes of this
tutorial I'll leave it on Explorer mode
normal even though I do like to use
expert but for what's worth will just
put it on normal here and then with your
numpad so this is one thing you have to
make sure is that you're using your
numpad I don't know how many people
message me saying Brian I can't
overclock I can't set any settings in
manually that's because you have to use
your numpad on your keyboard so with
that being said we're going to go for a
4.2 gigahertz overclock which is pretty
much a base overclock and it's
guaranteed on pretty much any 6600 K or
any 6700 K so on the cpu ratio there
just press 42 on your numpad and press
the Enter key on your numpad so now the
Ring ratio this is something going to
stress don't worry about
is if you're a beginner it's not really
worth it as long as you can see here as
long as the core the ring ratio is below
the CPU ratios you can see here it's at
3.9 gigahertz or 339 hundred megahertz
that's going to be perfectly fine we
don't have to touch that setting and
then we can go down here to the actual
voltages the CPU core voltage I'm going
to guess I'm just going to say 1.25 volt
should be easily obtainable on any 6600
Cal 6700 K to get a 4.2 gigahertz
overclock though if it's not you might
want to give it a little bit more
voltage by pressing the plus key on your
numpad so you can get the designated
voltage there but one thing to keep in
mind is a you can just set that to one
point two five volt and that's all you
really have to worry about with a basic
overclock so let's try that out
we'll just restart our computer now so
we go up to the X symbol here you can
also use your mouse as well if that's
plugged in and you just go yes so save
configuration yes and now upon rebooting
our computer we just take it into i-264
stress test it if it's crashing if your
computer is crashing then you will want
to go back into this bias by pressing
delete and then giving that voltage just
a little bit more one thing to keep in
mind is that I do not recommend going
past one point three five volt on the
CPU core this is on Windows 10 at the
moment so I'm using Windows 10 and on
the skylake architecture so once you're
on the desktop here you just open up I
264 and you go yes and then once we're
in the program here we can then sorry
that's that's just my computer I
upgraded to Windows 10 so it's a little
bit buggy we'll forget about that you go
up once you're into either 64 we just go
up to tools here and then we just go up
to system to ability tests so we open
that one up go up to tools again and
open up I 264 CPU ID so what this will
do is this will give you an idea of how
much voltage your CPU is running at and
also your if you stress test it what
temperatures you will get so once we've
got those two loaded up we can then
click on start here so hits
art and as you see here it's loading up
the CPU to its maximum capability there
so stress testing it in other words and
you want to run this for at least a good
ten minutes I find after about ten
minutes you're really homing in on
either stable or near stable though
honestly if you've got a full stable
overclock and you can't risk anything
crashing then you're obviously going to
want to do some real-world benchmarks
because I've found that I can run
benchmarks like prime95 like I 264 for a
good 24 hours and my programs still
crash occasionally and so I've had to up
the CPU voltage anyway so one thing to
keep in mind with these stress tests is
is that they won't give you a complete
guarantee sometimes of a 24/7 or 24
hours a day seven days a week
overclock so what we've got here is
pretty much like I'm pretty sure that
this overclock should be okay so we're
just going to test this out for ten
minutes and then we'll jump back to see
if it did pass the test so as you can
see here after about ten minutes of
passing the stress test it's still
running fine at 4.2 gigahertz at one
point two five volt now one thing you
will want to take a look at quickly as
well are your temperatures as you can
see here I just got over 50 degrees on
one of my cores here so that's really
good temperatures I'd say once you start
going around about 80 degrees 85 degrees
that's when you have to worry because
your CPU will actually start to throttle
and that'll mean reduce performance
though at these temperatures my CPU is
perfectly fine it's not going to
throttle at all so there you have it
guys that is a 4.2 gigahertz overclock
done very easily now one thing I will do
just to assure that this is a stable
overclock is I will load up some games
play some games obviously start doing
maybe a little light render just the
test and make sure that the overclock is
okay though if it does start crashing I
will want to go back into the BIOS and
just give it a little more voltage also
before we go out I'll quickly recommend
some other popular overclocks maybe 4.4
gigahertz at 1.3 volts so that's another
popular overclock however keep in mind
and the
is one thing I'm going to stress before
we close out is that every CPU is
different some CPUs may be able to get
to 4.6 gigahertz at 1.3 volt some may
only be able to get to 4.2 so as I was
saying before if that 4.2 gigahertz
crashes you might have to give it a
little bit more voltage here so it
really is just a matter of testing out
your own CPU and finding the overclocks
with this correlation here between
voltages and the CPU ratio so however my
CPU does get to 4.6 gigahertz at one
point three five volts I don't know what
happened there one point three five
volts so that's how that's about where
my CPU tops out at I can't get it to
boot at four point eight I can get it
just to boot at four point seven though
it isn't stable at those speeds however
four point six gigahertz is highly
satisfiable and I'm really happy with
this overclock so we'll just close out
there you can also yeah quickly mention
four point four at one point three volt
so there's some popular over clocks for
you guys however I'm just going to close
out at four point six and see if that
runs for you guys and then we'll move
over to a quick conclusion so that we
have it there guys that is a four point
six gigahertz overclock and that's a one
point three five volt now also about
memory I would recommend for the better
part just locking in those XMP profiles
and I'll put in a guide in the
description below a link where you can
check it out on how to lock in X and P
profiles for your memory but that is
very straightforward as well so with
that being said we'll move on now to a
quick conclusion so there you have it
guys that is a real basic oh sure
so that you have a guy that is a real
basic how-to on how to overclock your
skylake CPU that's the 6600 K or the
6700 K and honestly they're not going to
differ when it comes to overclocking
they're going to pretty much require the
same voltages to get to the same speed
on average so anyway guys if you have
any questions on how to overclock your
skylake CPU or anything you wish
no further then drop a comment in the
comment section below and I'll get back
to you as soon as I can and also don't
forget to leave a like and subscribe to
take your city you want to see more tech
news and reviews but that being said I'm
gonna peace out and I'll catch you later
