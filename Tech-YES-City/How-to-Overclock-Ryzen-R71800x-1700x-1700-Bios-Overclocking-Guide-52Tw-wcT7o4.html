Rison our seven CPUs and this is
basically going to be a guide for you
guys out there so you can get the most
performance out of your eight core CPUs
from AMD welcome back to tech city this
is brian coming to you guys today with
an overclocking tutorial and i'm going
to be up in the top right hand corner
this entire time guiding you guys
through this and this is going to be the
first part where I'm basically locking
in a very simple overclock but pretty
much anyone should be guaranteed to do
they keep in mind you will have to have
a decent cooler
a decent motherboard and a decent power
supply which I always recommend for
overclocking myself here I have a k2 40
predator also on an x3 70 asrock Taichi
and I've also got some ddr4 memory from
Corsair the RGB type and with that said
let's move into the boss here now the
first thing I will say is that the
bosses are different between different
motherboard manufacturers for instance
Zeus gigabyte MSI that will have
different looking biases to the asrock
taichi so especially for this first part
a lot of the settings should be very
similar for the advanced part which is
part twos and that's when things will
probably start to change a bit so if you
have an Azeroth board you will have an
easier time to deserve a clocking
tutorial though with that said we up the
top here we hit the left and right keys
we can move around in the settings here
in the first place we want to go to is
the OC Tweaker tab and now in here
basically we've got the CPU frequency
and voltage change hit enter and then
change that to manual and then we've got
here 3.6 gigahertz already there since
this is an 1800 X I believe it's 1700 X
is 3.4 gigahertz this is the old core
frequency essentially so what we want to
do here is we can hit the minus or plus
keys to change those values in 50
megahertz increments so we want to do is
boot this up or boost this up to 3.8
gigahertz this is the clock that we're
going to be going with and should work
for the majority of people and so we
lock that in there and then we go down
here to load XMP settings now I would
recommend trying this later because the
Rison plat for the am floor platform is
still in its infant stages so memory
overclocks is very
unstable on some boards especially with
some brands of memory for instance when
I first got my boarding I couldn't even
get to twenty-six hundred megahertz on
the memory so now I can actually lock it
in and get a solid twenty nine thirty
three but I'd recommend just leaving
this off for now until you've got
everything else working and for advanced
food training I like to disable this as
I find it just helps with even if you've
got an unstable overclock you can kind
of get away with booting back into the
BIOS and quickly changing things
otherwise you have to reset the CMOS and
that can be kind of a pain in the ass on
some of these motherboards down here
voltage mode we click this enter we want
to change that to overclock mode and
then down here to CPU V core voltage is
very important setting probably the most
important setting along with your clock
speeds is setting in a voltage for the
CPU to run out now we hit enter and we
go down here to fixed mode and you see
here I've actually already booked in the
voltage that you guys should be
operating this overclock at if you just
want guaranteed results of course every
CPU will differ for instance my CPU here
at 3.8 gigas can do it at around 1.3
volt which is a lot lower so if you have
the time to custom tune your CPU to its
voltage since it's a thing called just a
silicon lottery where you can get a CPU
that clocks higher to certain volts
another then I recommend you doing that
but if you just in your first time
overclocking you just want to get some
extra performance out of raisin and I
just recommend darling in 1.37 there and
also CPU load line calibration I don't
know what's going on here it was set on
auto now it's like going back to level
one I guess that's a bios bug that we're
live diagnosing here buddy we want to
change that to level two so on both
fronts here both the system-on-chip
load line calibration changes to level
two and on the cpu load line and
calibrations level two as well now this
book this is interesting because you see
a level one I found in the past and even
on this board it does like to over volt
just a little bit so level two I find is
a great balance so when you're loading
up the CPU you get a thing called V
droop essentially the CPU drops down
this can cause crashing on overclock so
level two I find just keeps that voltage
delivery just so smooth to the CPU so
we've got locked those in both level two
both three point seven they're
overclocked mode on the voltage and then
we
we're not going to touch the over
voltage or over current protection these
are put in place to protect you guys
from damaging your hardware so I
recommend leaving them on enabled unless
you're a very advanced overclocking
you're probably not going to be here if
you are but here we go here we've got D
Ram voltage we can leave it on auto
because we're not locking in that mp4
Hall and all the other voltages here you
guys can feel free to just copy my
settings copy/paste and put them in even
though they are believe this stock
voltages on these ones so once you guys
have locked in those settings I then
want you to go to the Advanced tab up
here and go to CPU configuration now
this is just a personal thing I find it
just helps with stability so much on
even the am-3 platforms when I was
overclocking them go to c6 mode and just
disable that and essentially because
we've got AMD cool and quiet already in
place that's AMD's version of down
clocking the cpu when it's not in use so
you want to disable that and then go
down here to AMD CBS and then going to
then common options and now down here
we'll see global sea state control I
also like to disable this completely to
as I find I have had some problems in
the past even when I was testing Rison
initially where games would crash with
these things on so now that we're done
there we can go to exit Save Changes in
exit and then reboot our computer into
Windows now if you also can't boot into
Windows at these settings you might want
to lower the clock speeds just a little
bit and then all and all raise the
voltage just a little bit more so now
that we're in Windows we can essentially
stress test our CPU to make sure things
are working properly so I like to open
up a program called Hardware monitor so
this is free to download it's easy you
don't have to pay anything for it and
all essentially tell you what your CPU
speed what the anti CPU speeds are
running out so easy is three-point aigis
all cause it's doing its job and if we
run into Cinebench we can then start a
Cinebench run just to check that it's
working of course you would want to get
a stress test program and run it for
quite some time to make sure things are
really stable now you can also jump into
games but I find Cinebench even just
running a quick Cinebench run is going
to tell you if your computer's either
completely unstable or near stable
so if it completes this run its either
stable or near stable which is a really
good thing considering how quick you can
get a reaction out of it so to speak so
once we've done that we can get our CPU
score there we can see it's pretty
strong
16:24 that's the first part of this
guide done so the guys out there who
just want to get a quick overclock get
some quick results that's it so now
we're going to move over to part two
where we're jumping into the boss and
we're going to get advance baby so now
it's time for part two or the advanced
part this is where things start to get a
little tricky so if you start getting
stressed don't guys I don't want you to
get stressed because then you start
losing your hair and and you know
generally all the ball guys I know they
don't want to go bald so I don't want
you guys to go bald again so try not to
get stressed or gadget is so first light
here we're going to overclock quicker
and we're actually going to set this
stuff that we did before back to auto
CPU frequency and voltage change change
that back to audio Ram screens I'm not
going to touch that just yet because we
do that last after we've done our
overclock and then here we can go to
overclock mode leave that there go down
to CPU V core voltage change that back
to auto then change this back to level 2
I don't know why it changed back to auto
and then jet that's about all we do in
that time so essentially resetting what
we did before in some parts and keeping
some other settings in place now we're
going to the Advanced tab here and we go
to CPU note 3 we go down to AMD CBS then
we go to Zen common options and they
move in here to a thing called custom
called P States and we go except so this
is getting tricky now guys so basically
what you want to do is I like to disable
from custom T state 3 on would like to
disable that and we go into custom piece
a0 first and go to custom here so this
is essentially where you're getting into
the root of the CPU itself these state 0
is essentially that single core boosting
methodology with access arbors because
we can take control of this and set
manually set it with T state one being
the same values that we'll get onto that
later we essentially lock all calls in
at our highest overclock for 24/7
stability so what we've got here is
essentially looking at a heap of numbers
and they're essentially to do with
thirty two hacks sequence so with the
values range from 0 0 to s F 0 0 being
the lowest and FS being the highest and
it's weird because in P state 0 VI D it
actually works in an inverse
relationship if you go down in these
values you get the lowest denominator I
mean sorry if you go down in value you
get a higher V call so it's kind of
interesting there but what we're going
to do is we're going to lock in fluency
here we change from one eight two one
seven and we keep going down and the
values here essentially I'll put these
in the description below this is getting
tricky all these values will set in a
number of frequency and also voltage so
to get your head around it I'll just put
a list in the description below you can
read from there but essentially it works
with hex and you can for instance lock
in a one and get a four point zero to
five gigahertz overclock or if we can go
down to a zero we should be getting a
four gig overclock now before that I
think it will be nine F will be three
point nine seven five gigahertz
overclock so we're going down in the
value and it's responding with the
overclock the mid volume here the D ID
we generally don't want to touch that as
I mean personally I've found that it
running at the state B clock is
essentially like your B clock setting
this that the state value of eight is
working perfectly fine everything's
butter smooth I have no need to change
this if you want to change this though
you may get C as we as we go up in value
here to actually lower the clock rate
stairs so it's the values are a little
bit tricky there too so as you do that
you can change the B clock essentially I
can leave it at eight and essentially if
you do changes just remember that it may
change in memory clock soo so I'd like
to leave that one alone so we're just
going to focus on F ID and VI D and here
we're going to block in your desired
overclock so for instance if you want a
90 verse overclock it will be nine C and
we get three point nine gears overclock
or if you want to lock in my max
overclock it's a 1 so that's where my
CPU topped out out guys
was four point zero to five gigahertz
and the voltage for that I believe was
three point
9 3 3 point 1 3 9 3 volts so that's
where I ended up with my sweet spot you
guys will have to tinker this to where
you can find your max CPU speed and
where it's sweet spot is for voltage
that's up to you guys to find that this
is where mine's at and again I'll put
those codes in the description below so
you can try and lock them in yourself so
once we've done that once we found that
with P state 0 we can then go down to P
state 1 and do the exact same thing for
this value here and lock that in
manually and what we'll have here is the
exact same overclock with P state 1 as
pcs 0 and then for this last one we can
also just leave that on custom and we
can then have a 2.2 gigahertz down clock
so essentially when the CPU is not in
use it will start throttling down and
essentially using less power which is a
good thing if you guys are going to be
using this thing 24/7 anything below
that I generally don't find the need for
personally I just find it could
sometimes cause problems and headaches
which you don't need when you're editing
videos or anything like that so that's
my custom settings that I find it runs
smooth as butter even in the infant
stages of Verizon this thing is running
so well so once we're done with that we
can then save changes and boot into
Windows so now we're going to move on
into the benchmark here f1 2016 which is
actually a great benchmark for CPU and
GPU at the same time especially at 1080p
so we've got here the graphics options
here and video mode we've got with SMA a
on and also 16 speed and SEO tropic
filtering and vsync offers course and
then we go here for the Settings
ultra-high let's see how the AMD Rison
CPU handles this at 1080p let's get in
there and put that on benchmark mode and
while we're doing this I'll actually
test talked about some extra things
arising so firstly the memory if you
guys have your CPU locked in at its
sweet spot overclock then what you want
to do after that is go back in and try
an get your Ram as high as possible
which on the am4 platform does make a
little bit more of a difference
does to the Intel platform so you do
this easily by just enabling the XMP
profile first up that's the best thing
you're going to get if you can't do that
then drop your timings thrown I mean
drop your megahertz a little bit on the
memory stay down to 220 66 that doesn't
work drop it down to 2,400 I did have
this problem initially when I got the
AMD CPU in with Azeroth gaming case 4
where I couldn't even move my memory up
at 2,600 megahertz so I had to drop it
down to 2,400 mega lo and behold a few
BIOS updates later I can now run over
29:33 so you can see with the micro code
updates coming into place memory speed
should only get better and better which
is the great thing also another thing is
if you are crashing if your computer is
crashing and you just getting frustrated
just take a breather it's normal guys
especially when you're overclocking so
make sure all your hardware is connected
properly things like a CPU that's not
connected properly can cause bone damage
so if you have everything connected
properly then all you have to do is
clear the CMOS with the pin the jumper
just push that to the right and then
back to the left or the clear CMOS
button or website so now you can just
take out the battery turn everything off
a little circular battery and you should
be back to normal again remember these
settings around these over clocks you're
not going to damage anything if
everything's set up properly because
there's over voltage protections in
place that protect your parts from
getting damaged anyway so I actually
haven't come into any problems ever
dealing with sort of pre sweet spot
overclock so that's a really good thing
don't be too afraid but it may get
frustrating at times just keep that in
mind also there is the high performance
mode in Windows which you will want to
turn on and for me personally I also
like to turn off the USB suspend setting
which I have had on the aim for platform
so far my keyboard cutting out sometimes
just randomly so when I disabled this I
no longer had any problems with my
keyboard or mouse cutting out so I
recommend you do that and also if you
want to I highly recommend tweaking your
windows for performance I've got a
Windows 10 optimization guide I'll put a
link in the description below for you
guys awesome if you want to get that
just a little bit more performance out
there and get your windows running as
best
can other settings like high-performance
H Pet I'm not going to test that yet as
again my computer is running really well
at the moment I don't need to really
change anything it's running completely
smooth so anyway let's move on now to
the next benchmark and for the last
benchmark is for autumn we're going to
run this at 1080p at Ultra settings or
extreme settings here you probably hear
that GTX 1080p I reference blasting in
the background but I'm also going to
talk about some final minute things with
benchmarking Rison and games as always
is why I'm running the games for you
guys they're a fantastic way to test
ability on your overclock now if you get
a CPU zero zero error that's most likely
because you either need to drop the
clock speed and/or increase the voltages
so just keep that in mind another thing
too is that when you are seeing these
results on YouTube like you're probably
seeing it's a little bit choppy but
trust me guys on the monitors I'm
looking at right now it is so damn
smooth it's just smooth as butter and on
the previous benchmark I did really one
thing about Rison is it does play
extremely smooth in games so that's one
thing I'm liking about this CPU at the
moment this is even with a GTX 1080p I
you see there the GPU is being utilized
near 100% which is great news for me
personally I'm going to be using this as
a workstation CPU and also on my 1440p
ultrawide monitor at 100 Hertz so if I
get over 100 Hertz or 100 FPS average
not going to be completely happy with
that as I'm not really a competitive
gamer nowadays so I'm pretty much it has
been but with that said guys if you
enjoyed this overclocking tutorial then
be sure to hit that like button and if
you have any frustrations or anything
that you have during the overclock then
be sure to drop a comment the comment
section below or check out the website
WWE TV flash forum and we'll have some
threads over there in terms of rising
overclocking let's say guys I'm going to
get on out of here and I'll catch you
guys in another SEC videos very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
