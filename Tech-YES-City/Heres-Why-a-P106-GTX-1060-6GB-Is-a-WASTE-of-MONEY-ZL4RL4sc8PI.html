This is NVIDIA's P106
graphics card that was made
specifically for crypto currency mining.
And the reason why crypto currency miners
I guess wanted to buy these
up, was because they were
cheaper than the gaming
graphics card variants,
the GTX 1066 Gigabytes.
Not only that, from the factory they had a
pre-optimized bios for
crypto currency mining.
And so, this made it more
efficient, plus it was cheaper.
I guess the appeal was there initially.
But, now it comes to resale time with the
crypto currency bust being
upon these graphics cards.
And was it really worth
those crypto currency miners
to get this sort of variant, and if so,
can these be used in
gaming PC's? Lets find out.
(upbeat music)
Welcome back to Tech Yes City.
And right here I have a Zotac P106 mining
graphics card, with no display-outs.
It's got 6 Gigabytes of DDR5 memory,
and the same dye as a GTX 1066 Gigabyte,
with 128 streamed processes.
However, there is a big difference,
This doesn't support
DirectX 12, and it also
doesn't have the PCI-Express
3.0 support built in.
So it is a cut down version in more ways
than just the display connectors.
NVIDIA have also aggressively locked these
at a firmware level.
And this is going to be the precursor
to the later part of the
video, where I've already
tried my hardest to flash
a GTX 1066 Gigabyte bios,
even from the same board partner, Zotac.
And it just was met with
failure after failure.
The closest I got was loading
up a, I guess, edited version
of NVFLASH off Reddit, and in
particular only one version
of that would enable me to get passed
the subsystem ID mismatch.
And even then, after those two checks,
I then still got met with
a board mismatch error.
So, basically flashing
these things to anything
other than another P106, is impossible.
At least from what I gather.
But apparently there is a
seller on Taobao, and uh
we will quickly interlude with a
little bit of a rap tune,
for that pronunciation.
(rap tune)
That are selling these graphics
cards for around 400 Yuan.
Which would be around about 60 USD.
Which is actually what I paid for
this when I was over in Vietnam.
I paid 1.3 million Dong, which I guess
would be around 60 USD,
or 80 Australian Dollars.
And so immediately the appeal for this
graphics card at the price
range, seems, and I put
a big emphasis on seems,
very good at first.
Imagine getting GTX 1066
Gigabyte performance,
even for half the value of that of a
used GTX 1066 Gigabyte retail version.
That is what it seems like at face value.
Until I started going
through all the steps.
And if you want to do
this, then perhaps you
may wish to get one off
the seller on Taobao,
instead of getting this one right here.
Because, this one I had right here,
I couldn't flash it again,
I came into problems.
But when I followed
the step-by-step guide,
and the first thing you
need to do in order to
get this working properly,
is reset your computer,
click on that option, and then
go into advanced settings,
and then click into start-up your computer
with advanced options.
And then upon rebooting your computer,
you can then select option
7, either via pressing
the 7, or F7 key, and this
will ignore driver enforcement.
And so you can then use the custom driver
that is posted on the internet.
I only managed to get
this driver off a person
who speaks Chinese on the
Linus Tech Tip forums,
who actually uploaded it to Google Drive.
So, big thank you to that individual.
He also posted up the REG Edit hack.
So, once you've restarted your computer
after doing that ignore
driver enforcement,
you can then install the hacked driver,
and then also the REG
Edit hack after that.
And essentially what this does is it will
utilize the GPU's main source of power,
and combine it with the
motherboard onboard graphics.
And then essentially use that
output on your motherboard
to then play games whilst utilizing the
power from the graphics card itself.
It's actually designed for laptops,
via NVIDIA's Optimus technology.
Except there was just a
few big problems with this
when I started doing
this, and I did get it to
work initially, and I thought
wow, this might actually work.
But after that, it started
coming into problems
where I tried out Rainbow Six:
Siege and it wouldn't boot
because it detected an unsigned driver.
And then I tried to load up
DOTA 2, and this was really
crazy because it just crashed.
And then when I tried to load it up again,
the performance was really bad.
And then I went back into
the application settings,
where the preferences
are, and I no longer had
the option to select the graphics card
as the high performance mode.
So essentially Steam
must have done something
where it detected it and locked it out.
So for me, this was very unsuccessful.
In that I thought I got it working,
but it just didn't work in the end.
And then I've been going through some of
the comment sections as well,
in relation to this P106,
and it seems like a few other people
are having issues with their games.
Not to mention the future
validity of this method,
I mean you are using an unsigned driver.
And, whether people want
to keep freely hacking
those drivers for future
reference, after they've
sold off all those P106's,
is another story altogether.
So, I think maybe the
Taobao seller who is selling
this particular model, they
do claim in their listing
that the Gigabyte version is able
to work better than the other version.
So perhaps they've loaded up some sort of
custom hack on the graphics card itself.
And they're able to get it detected as
a normal GTX 1066 Gigabyte,
that would explain
if they got theirs working fine.
But you've still got that unsigned driver,
which will cause problems, especially
in competitive multiplayer titles.
So moving through the
steps with this Zotac P106,
it was unsuccessful and it is a shame.
I mean ultimately, I would
have loved to have seen
maybe one display out
on this graphics card.
And if you then could hack
a GTX 1066 Gigabyte bias
into these, then there's
no reason after that
why it wouldn't work just
like a normal GTX 1060.
For instance, when we looked at the RX470
in the previous video I
have done, where I actually
flashed a normal RX470
bias onto that mining card,
that then worked like an RX470 in games.
And it's going to have no problems
going into the future whatsoever.
So ultimately when it
comes down to this method,
I can't recommend it, at least
with the sample I have here,
which is the Zotac version.
Perhaps the Taobao sellers have theirs
working successfully, with more games.
And they have more consistency.
But at least with what I've got here,
I can't recommend this, and for the price
it sort of makes sense,
it is coming very cheap
in terms of what they're selling those
graphics cards for, compared
to what other GTX 1066
Gigabytes are listed for,
even on the website itself.
So ultimately when it comes down to it,
the P106's, initially
when I heard about them,
I didn't advise anyone buy these,
even if they were crypto currency miners.
Because this was the problem
I did foresee in the past.
I mean, if there's a crypto currency bust,
and then these things
can't be used for gaming,
then they're essentially worthless now.
I mean they might be good to someone who's
re-soldering and tinkering graphics cards
that are GTX 1060's and
have legit problems,
where they might have a dead memory bank
and they're re-soldering, but even then,
those people aren't going to be paying
much at all for these cards.
If there are people out there who can
solder on display outputs to these,
and then manage to
somehow put a custom bias
from a GTX 1066 Gigabyte on here,
then that may be a good work around.
So there may be some more
to come with the P106's.
But as it stands, buying one
of these in it's current form,
and trying to do this
method, I cannot recommend it
at this stage.
And I guess when it came down to it,
using it in the real
world, and digging deeper,
and trying many different things,
it just became more of a pain in the A.
