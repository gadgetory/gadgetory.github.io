coming back to you guys today with a
memory speed comparison for AP use
testing 1866 speed memory versus 1600
speed memory and motive li testing
whether this makes a difference for FPS
now I'm testing at 1080p and I'm also
testing under 3/8 70 K which isn't as
fast as the 5800 of the 6800 k but it's
still a decent APU now I'll be giving
showing you guys the benchmarks and also
be showing you guys a recommended bios
tweak at the end and also give you guys
my thoughts and opinions on what I think
you know but in regards to this APU and
memory speeds so anyway let's get on
with the benchmarks alright so looking
at the first benchmark here we have
Batman Arkham Asylum this is at 1080p
and medium quality settings and we can
see here that there's virtually no
difference the only difference was in
the average frames per second which was
like point to 2 frames per second higher
which is pretty much put that down to
variance the minimum and the maximum
were the same now looking at black ops 2
at medium quality settings at 1080p
again we had almost virtually the same
results with the maximum banks just one
frame higher at 1866 and the average
being slightly lower at 1866 but again
you can put this down to variance so
virtually the same with black ops 2 now
skyrim this is 1080p ultra now this is a
setting that I know is stressful for
CPUs and RAM because when I did these
tests on my Intel it did net results
between different Ram speeds and again
that does net different results at 1080p
on Ultra for an APU so at 1866 the
maximum is were the same but the minimum
was one FPS higher 14 dresses 13 and the
average frames per second was 17 point
one two verses sixteen point five two
now although that's not much of a
difference in broad numbers in
percentage terms it's I think roughly I
don't know maybe you're almost five
percent I'd have to do the calculations
but again it made it a bit of a
difference but ultimately the biggest
difference that was was made in terms of
AP use performance for AP use was
changing the amount of dedicated ram in
the BIOS so the auto it's scary to note
that the auto setting for this is 200
fifty-six megabytes on the three at 70 K
the 5800 K in the 6800 K I think it's
512 but you want to at least max this
out so I'll show you those this tweak
right now and basically when this was on
auto at 256 megabytes of dedicated DDR
Ram for the air for the GPU portion of
the APU we saw a fourteen point fourteen
point four four frames per second in
Skyrim with a minimum of seven and this
was really horrible screen tearing this
was unplayable like completely
unplayable the maximum was also low as
well when we changed this to 512 which I
did on my tests on 512 dedicated
megabytes of RAM we had here the average
as you saw in the benchmark before
sixteen point five two so that was a
pretty quite a big difference quite a
significant difference so let's move on
now I'll show you guys how to do this
involves how to change the dedicated
memory for the APU in the bus so I want
you to guys to start up your computer
and enter BIOS bar there hitting the f2
or the Delete key and now once you're in
BIOS will notice straight away that it
just as it says here 256 megabytes of
shared memory that is the auto setting
now we're going to want to change this
and also one important thing to note is
that different motherboard manufacturers
will have different looking biases so
this is the asrock UEFI bias for the fn1
motherboard so once we've done that I
want you guys to go over to the Advanced
tab and into North Bridge configuration
now once we so hit enter and once you
enter here you can go down to share
memory and you can see here it's on
order I want you guys to change this to
either 512 megabytes or higher if you
can and basically what this will do
would give you it'll give you the best
performance increase as opposed to
memory speeds per se so after you've
done that just hit Save Changes and exit
and you're good to go
so in conclusion I will say that I do
not recommend spending money on faster
memory for an APU in order to get an FPS
increase I would honestly just save that
money and put that money into a
dedicated graphics card and I'm gonna be
releasing a video pretty soon that shows
the difference between APU and a
dedicated gaming rig like my own rig so
I'll be doing some
benchmarks apples to apples however keep
in mind that you know my rig is
overclocked and you know the APU rig is
not overclocked but it just goes to show
this the next the next video that I will
bring out will go to show that you know
apos really aren't as they're nowhere
near as good as a dedicated CPU and a
dedicated graphics card so you know if
you guys want to go with an APU
pacifically for gaming then I only
suggest doing so if you can't if you
can't spend the extra money like if you
can only go with like a 300 dollar
budget because if you can get like a 400
dollar budget you can get something like
a 77070 and that will kick the pants off
any APU out there at the moment for
gaming so guys I hope you enjoyed this
video if you did please give it a thumbs
up and if you have any questions about
this video please leave a comment the
comment section below and I'll get back
to you guys as soon as I can anyway I
hope you enjoyed this video and peace
