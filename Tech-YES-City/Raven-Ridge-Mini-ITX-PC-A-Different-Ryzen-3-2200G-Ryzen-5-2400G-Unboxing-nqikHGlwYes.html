massive reviewers kid this is for the
highly anticipated upcoming risin AP use
now these are the ones that have the
rise in CPU cause not the previous APU
that really no one cared about these
ones you're getting Vega graphics rising
CPU cores people want to know how they
perform now in this video I can't show
you how they perform until the end EA
lifts but keep in mind I will give you
the numbers as soon as they're available
and I will and today actually I want to
get your feedback as well what testing
do you want to see so let me know in the
comment section below what testing you
want to see with both these AP use you
can see you have already unboxed the
contents so basically inside this
massive box I got a mini ITX motherboard
a USB stick two of these CPUs and they
both have Wraith stealth coolers with
them I'm guessing the whole theme of the
risin AP uses that AMD now has a really
nice mini ITX solution now we'll be
building a PC in this video a little bit
later out laying all the costs but we've
also got here main focus is the 2400 G
and the 2200 g20 400 G it's gonna come
in at 169 USD or if you're in Australia
235 or strain dolls 2200 g 99 US dollars
so it's extremely cheap and you're gonna
be able to get an interest rate for a
hundred and thirty-nine AUD so the
pricing is very competitive especially
if you compare to the current rise and
CPUs that are out there for instance the
1500 X I believe comes in at the same
price as the 2400 G the biggest
difference being this has a graphics
dedicated portion on it but the 2400 G
only has four megabytes of level 3 cache
versus the 1500 X which has 16 megabytes
I believe the Verizon 5 1400 which comes
at $150 that has 8 megabytes of level 3
cache I believe so you are getting a
little less level 3 cache but of course
you are getting those Vega cores on this
dedicated APU and that's gonna make a
world of a difference for some people if
you want to get a graphics solution on a
budget but also want to make mini ITX
Verizon's solutions right beside it is
its little brother the 2200 G now you
got 4 cores 4 threads and sorry I should
have mentioned you've got 4 course 8
threads 3.6 gigahertz on all cores out
of the box and you can overclock that as
well
2200 G you
got four cores four threads so very
similar to the risin three 1200
especially in price as well
so 99 US dollars you get the same case
structure as the 2400 G but of course
you don't have SMT just like the Verizon
3 1200 or the 1300 X but you do have a
3.5 gigahertz base clock which is
actually quite aggressive I think it's
more than the Rison 3 1200 out of the
box so this one's gonna be a little
winner in my opinion actually both going
to be really good but this one in
particular here the 2200 G you're gonna
get a lot of value out of this if you
couple it with an a320 motherboard
that's just my opinion but of course
these CPUs here we'll take a look at
them in the review also inside the box
we got this Mini ITX motherboard from
MSI a be 350 motherboard has Wireless
built in and also on the back has that
nvme slot as well so this is gonna be
great for mini ITX builders and also
that g.skill memory clean black
aesthetic and it's also got those 3200
XMP profiles which work out of the box
so they're extremely fast and if you're
on a rising CPU you will know just how
important memory speeds are for this
architecture so what we're gonna do now
is put together this little mini ITX PC
and then we're gonna take a look at it
so now here's the bill complete a mini
ITX solution with a rising CPU and an
APU in it 2400 G $169 really kicking it
in terms of its price point and then
we've got 480 dollars the in win chopin
i like to call it the in win chopped and
personal because i believe it's a
chopped and up to the competition then
we've got the core set MP 500 500
gigabytes this comes in around two
hundred twenty eight dollars currently
so pretty fair price a pretty decent
nvme solution very fast by the way and
then we've got for one hundred and ten
dollars i believe this is the price for
the msi be 350 i pro AC and then lastly
of course is the most expensive thing
this is the memory so ddr4 prices at the
moment ridiculously expensive two
hundred and sixty five dollars for this
kit of memory so this leaves the whole
total is built to around eight hundred
and fifty dollars in much better times
when ddr4 prices were lower you'd
probably expect to pay around seven
hundred and fifty dollars for something
like this so power supply is integrated
into this unit it is a 100 watt power
supply and of course with the rise and
TDP settings printed on the box we've
got 45 watts and also 65 watts i believe
is a 65 watt figure is for everything
that's when you've got the graphics
going a full ball and you got the cpu
going at full ball as well 45 watt of
course if you don't want to use the apu
solution that would be a figure just for
the cpu so looks like it's going to be a
very low powered solution and how's it
going to perform i'm going to show you
guys in an upcoming video so stay tuned
and if you enjoy this video then be sure
to hit that like button and let me know
out of these two AP use which one are
you looking more forward to and why love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always and also let me know in the
comments section to what test you want
to see with both these AP use and i'll
make sure i get that done for you so
stay tuned for the upcoming review and
i'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
