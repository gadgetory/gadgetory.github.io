been following the channel and she's
seen some of the nice builds coming out
with RGB and tempered glass and she's
asked me Brian why don't I have a PC
like this and then it occurred to me
that the last PC er built her was quite
a while ago with a PC case called a vent
oh and that's not to be confused with
the Japanese bento which is like a lunch
box although they kind of do look
similar both being very plain and
simplistic
however the computer case that I have
here not only looked pretty bad it also
needs a serious clean it's got cobwebs
in it and when I saw this thing I was
like damn I'm gonna have to do a techie
ICT cleanse on it and then also install
it into a brand new case and this brings
us to the Cougar Panzer which is a
tempered glass case that comes in at 89
USD or if you're in Australia
ninety-nine Australian dollars so they
got the pricing right there however it
doesn't come with any fans in the front
however when I go to Aliexpress I can
then get a three kit of fans RGB with
the controller for under 20 US shipped
to your door and of course while we're
at it we wires will put in some custom
cable mods and make this thing look
absolutely pronto
welcome back to tech yes City this is
brian coming to you guys today with a
video on how to get a cheap cosmetic
upgrade for your pc so we've got three
parts here that have talent in it around
about 150 USD now i know you think
that's expensive and definitely in the
past i have built some computers that
perform pretty well for even this price
for the total build however they don't
look the best although for some people
they actually do look pretty good but
that's besides the point we've got here
RGB tempered glass and a pc build that's
going to look very clean and will suit a
modern house so from here on in we're
gonna take all these old pc parts out
put them in the new pc case but if
they're too old we may even upgrade them
even though the purpose of this build is
not for any performance upgrades it's
just simply cosmetics my mum is the type
of person who will literally just use a
computer to use word excel check emails
or even place spider solitaire and the
graphics card that we have in there is a
seventy eight seventy which of course is
perfectly fine for a constant smooth
60fps in spider solitaire so now it's
time to get this whole process in motion
when it comes to cleaning out my builds
I always use a combination of brake
cleaner and wd-40 the brake cleaner
really tends to give those parts a
really deep clean and then the wd-40
gives it that nice new look shine
however some of the parts are just
simply too old for instance we've only
got four gigabytes of RAM and it's not
even a symmetrical configuration so
we're gonna change that upgrade it to
eight gigabytes of RAM and also change
the graphics card from a 78 70 to a GTX
670 and the reason for this is that I
had this exact GTX 670 same model from
Galaxy before they became Galax and I
was using that to produce my earlier
content on tech yes City so it's kind of
a sentimental upgrade if anything even
though it's not such a big performance
upgrade so gonna be inserting that into
the build and then for the custom cables
we're using game of chief cables in
Australia you can pick these up for a
whole kit like this for around about 50
Australian dollars shipped to your door
so it's very cheap they also come with
pre combed cables to save any hassles
and they'll fit on a relatively
inexpensive PC and now the fans for
under $20 you can get a really good kit
of RGB fan
three fans also comes with an RGB
controller and now onto the last
component of today's build which takes
up most of the budget this is the Cougar
Panzer which is a mid-sized ATX case
with tempered glass
it also has support for three hundred
and sixty millimeter rads both on the
front and the top and on the rear you
can have a 120 mil rat and on the bottom
as well you also have support for two
3.5 inch hard drives for 2.5 inch SSDs
and on the top of the case there's two
USB three outs and also two USB 2 outs
so all in all great case with a lot of
expansion however let's get on to
building this PC and seeing how it turns
out
so I've got this bill beside me it is
complete it is looking really good and I
managed to give it a trial run in spite
of solitaire and for some odd reason it
just took me such a long time to win a
game of four suited spider solitaire and
I don't even know why I kept playing but
anyway let's get back to this build
really good cosmetics and of course
tempered glass if you're into that 2017
vibe this case will give it to you on a
budget but not only that it was just
really easy to work with I've really
nothing bad to say about this case keep
in mind though you don't get included
fans which is why at the start of the
video I showed that Aliexpress kit of
three fans for under 20 USD and it's
also RGB and they do a great job of
cooling and of course giving you a bit
of bling of course they are limited by
the controller I'm sure if you had a
better controller you could get more
colors and modes unlocked but seriously
for under $20 great Buy and then of
course we've got the custom slave cables
from Game achieve they do a great job
I'm not only making this build
color-coordinated but also extending the
cables on the power supply so they could
fit the sockets with ease so we've got
great expandability in this case and
we've now got great cosmetics for
literally a hundred and fifty US dollars
it is that cheap to get something that's
tempered-glass RGB and will just
completely look awesome if you're into
building new computers or if you want to
update your old specs and in the case of
this build here even though we're
running some older parts like a b85
asrock motherboard and also an i3 and
eight gigabytes of ram it's all my mum
will need for doing microsoft word and
also browsing the web and of course
playing her favorite game which is
spider solitaire
so from here on we're gonna show off
this build to my mum and see how she
reacts to it hey mom I got something to
show you do you want to come into the
office please look at their lives
oh that mine yeah
and mine with the light oh nice so you
said you want a better cosmetics and you
better come inside hmm well that's nice
it's got all the fancy lights and
they're in the glass all right exactly
see now the longer have to use the bento
the bento are the one I was using yeah
hmm oh this is lovely
can you there's the lights change like
there we have it I showed her this
computer and she absolutely loved it and
also got a big thank-you kiss so you
can't go wrong so onto this case beside
me the Cougar Panzer I absolutely loved
it and the reason being is because it's
for pretty much everyone out there
especially for people just getting into
PC gaming and the reason is is you've
got that case shroud over the power
supply so you can put in inexpensive
power supplies but generally have
ketchup and mustard cables and then
non-modular so you can hide all the
cables behind this shroud and also get
some cable extensions and make your
build still look aesthetically pleasing
and you've also got tempered glass to
really bring out any lighting that you
put inside the build now with cable
management so much room to work with
you're gonna have no problems doing any
cable management you also get some
included zip ties and things are going
to be extremely easy drive bays for 2.5
inch SSD bays they come out and install
the drives with these 3.5 inch drive
bays you got 2 of those and again very
easy to work with and then with the case
itself there was no sharp edges the
installation instructions were extremely
easy to follow and the case came off
very easy at the front so it was very
simple to install three fans and also
very quick
then what about negatives with the
Cougar Panzer and seriously for this
money $89 I could not fault one thing
about it of course you will have to add
your own fans I think the one exhaust
fan isn't enough though the tempered
glass if you are coming into PC gaming
and this is your first build to be very
careful with tempered glass if you do
break this stuff you're gonna have one
serious mess on your hands it's also a
little bit heavier of course then
something like acrylic now when it comes
down to it this is one case that I can
easily recommend to anyone so spacious
especially for a mid sized ATX tower and
then we
the Aliexpress fans we dropped in three
of those under $20 they did a fantastic
job of giving airflow to the case but
also giving it a bit more bling the
controller was a little bit limited in
its color range and also its modes
however I'm sure with a better
controller you could up your RGB game if
you so wanted to anyway guys that's
about it for me today if you enjoyed
this video then be sure to hit that like
button and let me know in the comment
section below what was your favorite
cosmetic upgrade of this PC today I'm
seriously liking all three parts
especially for the value that you get
out of them if you're upgrading and want
that really good look on your PC and
also sorry I haven't made a video in a
little while I've been quite ill I got a
flu again and I was moving and I put my
back out twice so it's been really rough
and also the new studio is coming along
as well I will make some progress
updates on that at the meantime I will
be recording from here and recording
some videos for you guys and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
