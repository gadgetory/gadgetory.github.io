time from Oris within nine gigabits per
second edition which as always I'll be
testing both stock and overclocked and
also comparing it with the rx 580 so
let's take a look welcome back to tech
yes City this is Brian and today we have
a heap of new games which I'm going to
be testing out with these two graphics
cards so without wasting any more time
let's get those benchmarks rollin
so we have a guys the benchmarks in the
games do all the talking like usual and
I find that the GTX 1060 when you
overclock it it does perform really well
and also in the case of the Auris card
it overclocked extremely well and this
is with fan speeds of 80% which keep the
card very cool I recorded a maximum
temperature of 52 degrees after running
heaven for half an hour and also that
80% is also really inaudible I'll let
you guys take a listen to the various
fan speed
so going back to those benchmarks that
the stock figures you can see that the
RX 580 and the gtx 1060 do indeed trade
blows so if you were to buy one you
probably at the moment by whichever one
you could actually get it retail as the
mining craze is pretty much sold out
every gtx 1060 and every rx 580 out
there so if you managed to pick up one
of these at retail value then you would
quite simply be winning at this point in
time however one thing I did this out in
my previous comparison whether the RX
580 does have freesync support which is
a technology implemented in monitors
that changes the monitors refresh rate
to the actual fps of the GPU so you can
get a smoother experience on the RX 580
on a budget
though as opposed to the gtx 1060 you do
get a card that has better performance
per watt and this enables the card to
essentially run cooler because it's
using less power and with that it also
enables the card to run quieter in my
opinion because of the fact that it's
running cooler I believe these things
are all related to one another and some
mystical triangle figure Illuminati
confirmed mid review there's a last
thing I'd like to mention without making
this a gtx 1060 versus RS 580 comparison
video is that i found that the gtx 1060
especially in the case of the Auris does
have a bit more overclocking Headroom at
least compared to the RX 574 morris that
i test itself there's one thing to make
apples-to-apples comparisons is that say
you do get a little bit more
overclocking Headroom on the nvidia
counterpart which in turn does help you
get better performance as seen in the
benchmarks those looking more closely at
the horas card it does have a steel
backplate with a copper fin on the rear
of the card now I actually haven't found
this to make any real difference in
real-world temperatures but I have found
with all the cards of amoris that have
come through here they have overclocked
marginally better than the competitors
in this case I did have the MSI GTX 1060
around and I found the fire strike
scores and also in the benchmarks the
GTX 1060 or did edge it out by just a
little bit even though the stock
settings were very much the same moving
over to the rear of the card in terms of
input and output you get one give eid
three display ports and
on hdmi 2.0 so this is plenty enough for
a triple monitor setup going over the
right side of the card there is one PCIe
eight pin in and also the Auris branding
which is RGB and can be controlled by
the software and it allows you to do
different effects you can also even put
in a rainbow or double flashing but my
favorite feature is the GPU temperature
monitor function which will change the
lighting according to how hot your
graphics card actually is at the time
also included in the software is the
ability to select from three different
preset modes silent which does drop the
fan speeds and drops the core clock
speed also gaming which is your preset
out of the factory setting and OC mode
which adds an extra 25 megahertz to the
core you can also manually change
settings like the fan speeds the
voltages and the clocks yourself and
save these to different profiles and
monitor three different settings at that
time though I do prefer for manual
overclocking still to use MSI
Afterburner with River tuner attached
and going back to the front of the card
the whole heatsink is cooled down by 380
millimeter fans which do have manual
control and also have fan stop
technology which will completely remain
quiet if the graphics card is in idle on
the desktop for example or the graphics
card is just not being used heavily and
it's judgment time for the GTX 1060 from
orison what do I think of it and would I
recommend it and currently and if you're
in Australia you can get this for around
470 Australian dollars so it is a little
bit expensive and it does commander
premium over previous ggf 1066 gigabyte
models they keep in mind though the
overclock on this thing are very
impressive and this is something that
I've found with a lot of Oris cards that
have come through here they have all
overclocked pretty well the power
consumption on this card is actually
really good as well it only uses up an
extra 5 watts compared to the MSI
version when they'll both overclock and
of course this does overclock a little
bit better than the MSI card did and
this was both at 25 degree ambient
temperatures so if you live in other
parts of the world this gtx 1060 I
believe is pretty much currently sold
out everywhere and this is the case with
a lot of other gtx 1060 s due to a
mining craze with crypto currencies
which is a different topic for a
different day which I'll be making a
video on so States
to that and really if you can pick up
one of these cards for retail price at
the moment I would recommend doing so if
you want to get into PC gaming because I
believe that the only cons that are
going for retail in a lot of parts of
the world at the moment
other gtx 1050 t is and also the gtx
1080s
there are these 1060 since they are
pretty good at mining certain crypto
currencies are selling out pretty much
everywhere and it's also I believe a
similar story with the GTX 10 70's and
1080 t eyes and of course the RX 5 80s
and RX 570 though when it all comes down
to it the gtx 1060 from taurus is a very
solid implementation it remained very
quiet over cost really well and also
remains really cool so I was very
impressed by this card and it's one that
I can definitely recommend as I said
before if you can pick it up for at
least retail price anyway guys I hope
you enjoyed this review and let me know
in the comments section below what you
think about the GTX 1061 rx5 ATS and the
whole mining craze and I'll catch you
guys in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
