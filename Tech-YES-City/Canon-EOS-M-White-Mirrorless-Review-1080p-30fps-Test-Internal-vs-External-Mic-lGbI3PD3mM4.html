burn as you coming back to you guys
today with an unboxing and review of the
Canon EOS m now this is a DSLR
mirrorless the SLR packed into a small
body so this camera this is the double
lens kit now first off the box comes
just a standard DSLR box I find most
DSLRs come very well packaged this being
no exception it comes very tightly
packaged and the boxing is very adequate
adequate and keeps your camera very
you're not going to cause any damage
because it's very good box so that's the
box very kudos to come in there now
comes with the manual so let's get the
boring part done first is the manual and
it comes with three CDs I have yet to
use any of this yet so don't really need
that and this is what it comes with so
this is the double kit and as you can
see here it comes with a lot of extras
the first being that it comes with the
pancake lenses the 22 millimeter pancake
lenses which if you couple this and this
together it makes for a very compact
DSLR that you can carry with you
anywhere now i will say first off that i
have tested this for a few days now and
it's an amazing camera yes the reviews
are right the autofocus is a little bit
slow but that being said everything else
about this camera is amazing especially
the auto there the auto on this camera
is just absolutely phenomenally good so
I'd have to put the battery in but
here's the battery it's a pretty small
battery I find the battery life on this
is actually very very good I the review
site said again that there was a rear
sights of a bashing the battery life but
I thought the battery life is absolutely
fine on this camera and the screen is
beautiful as a touchscreen obviously the
manual controls are not as good as a
real DSLR but look at the size of this
thing is really small for a DSLR camera
it is so compact as well very durable I
love the feel of this I think it's a
steel body and the white this is the
white version so it looks really amazing
i really like counting what they've done
with this camera now i got this for
about so i'll show you guys some shots
later on the screen but the screen is
really good i'll pull up some 1080p
scaled-down photos for you but the shots
on this thing is beautiful absolutely
amazing if you just put it on auto
cannon this this will pretty much get
you the right shot every time it's
justin
phenomenal camera even though the
autofocus is a little bit slow but for
video I find that the autofocus is
absolutely very good especially with
these lenses here the 18 to 55
millimeter lenses these lenses are very
good the image stabilization is good
they're very light the they make no
noise while they're adjusting and then
trying to focus so that's a very good
thing as well and I find most the time
I'm actually using these lenses rather
than the pancake lenses now it does come
with a canon adapter as well so you can
adapt your other canon lenses to the EOS
m if you have the bigger lenses from
other cameras and it will work fine so
that's a good cook so this is this only
comes with the double lens kit not with
the other single lens gets so i'm pretty
sure that comes only with the double n
skip this as well and now it doesn't
have a flash on board the camera yeah
but that's not too if you get the double
lens kit actually comes with a flash
this is the speedlight 90 x it comes
with a flash that is very bright it
works very well so it actually doesn't
come with the battery as well but you
have to buy your own battery separately
to that but it does come with a patch
for it as well which is very good it's a
genuine canon pouch now the strap here i
personally am not going to use a strap
with this camera so you can do what you
want with this you can sell it if you
want i'm actually going to sell mine
another good thing too is I probably
will sell this so if you guys don't
don't um I mean if you guys want the
cheapest camera possible I recommend
getting the double lens kit and then
filling all these accessories and you
can probably get about one hundred
dollars for this you probably get about
sixty dollars for the adapter and
probably about 120 dollars for the lens
so you can bring the cost down to this
camera by about two hundred and fifty
dollars and I got mine for five hundred
twenty dollars that would make this
camera about two hundred and seventy
dollars after you sell your stuff which
is absolutely phenomenally good for a
DSLR a mirrorless sort of compact camera
so two hundred seventy dollars if you
sell your accessories that you don't
need and yeah just bring the cost down
of this thing really well so now the
reason why I got this is because you
guys would probably know that the sony
camera i had a sony camera for doing
reviews and a lot of video and the sony
camera absolutely had a horrible
on-board audio the picture was pretty
good the image stabilization was pretty
good everything was good except for in
my opinion the on-board audio it was
horrible
couldn't adjust this I couldn't adjust
it but with the Canon you can actually
adjust the recording levels on the fly
you can set them manually so whatever
you want to record out you can change
the volume it also has the auto changing
as well so if your audios clipping it
will scale it down so it actually has an
auto adjustment as well which works
really well and the ADC the actual audio
digital converter on this camera is very
well very good so if you couple it with
an external microphone i have here the
89 9 42 audio-technica it's a cheap $40
Mon Ami but it works really good with
this camera fits really well on the
horseshoe and it does a very good job
I'll give you guys a quality test later
just to show you how good it is but
there this thing the on-board audio on
this thing is amazing I can't recommend
it enough is a lot of people a lot of
people get this for 1080p video and but
they don't like a lot of people buy
these dear sellers for 1080p video but
they don't realize that audio makes up
such a huge part of filming and so if
you guys have really crap audio it's
going to turn you off and as well as
going to tone viewers off if you have
bad audio so audio was a big thing for
me a lot of my reviews had previously
with the sony camera the audio i had to
edit it a lot even to get it sounding
decent the actual normal audio was just
clipping harder than a veterinarian so
flipping birds but you know this thing
is really good the on-board audio I
can't say enough good things about the
1080p video give you guys some sample
footage soon in low light and in normal
conditions now it comes with a USB cable
as well which is you know USB 2 so need
to transfer your files over to the
computer you can do that and a standard
charger you will most likely want to buy
a second battery as well so I always if
I have it any camera always have a
second battery backup battery because I
always run out of battery and I'm never
plan for it so having a backup batteries
always a good thing so anyway let's do
you guys probably wondering let's get
over to some footage and I will say that
the camera like the actual photos of
this thing i'll show you that first the
photos of this thing is phenomenal it
takes phenomenal photos for the size
especially with the kit lens the photo
quality is just amazing out of the box
so i can highly recommend this product
the only downside is probably
no on bill night onboard flash which
doesn't really bother me too much I
hardly ever use flash and the focus but
the focus is not that bad i mean if
you're going to sporting events at the
only time i can see the focus being
problem so anyway let's get on to the
actual tests anyway guys alright so I've
just got some taken some still photos
now and I have left every this is all on
auto so the camera has just got the auto
switch which I believe in like 95 or
more percent of cases this thing just
takes the right photo it gets the right
photo pretty much right all the time so
it's just amazing also I've done here is
taking the photo 18 megapixels jpg
scaled it down and then put it into the
video rendered it and then YouTube's
rear ended at eight megapixel and so if
this photo still looks amazing come the
time this video's you guys watching this
video then this thing just takes I'm
telling you now the quality of these
photos on my desktop of phenomenal I
dare say that this camera with this a 10
megapixel sensor and this kit lens takes
better photos than a 650d with its kit
lens that's just my guess I just think
this is the most amazing kit lens I've
ever seen especially on a budget 500
allah camera so anyway i hope you guys
enjoyed these stills and let's get on to
the video test ok guys so this is 1080p
video with at the moment we're going to
be is 30 frames per for a second and
it's on the internal mic on the canon
eos m so this is a stereo mic so it's
got two speakers recording and let's
change it over to the mono external mic
that had bought so give you guys a test
to see the sound difference ok guys
hopefully you can see me i'm testing
this with the external microphone now
and I've got the manual I've set the
manual input level to the middle and
yeah hopefully sounds good anyway the
video quality on this thing is
phenomenal the autofocus is actually
really good with the 18 to 55 millimeter
lens
is and you probably see it already now
it's getting my ugly face ugly yeah I'm
gonna put myself down my average face so
on in detail hopefully anyway I really
thought it's really at the bed but I
only gets reviewed on and this will be
coming soon the Intel 240 gigabyte SSD
review I'll be benchmarking this
unboxing it for you guys and also i'll
be unboxing live really unbox it but
i'll be reviewing this audio technica
994 to external microphone which is
currently situated on top of this EOS m
anyway look forward to catching you guys
soon so if you have any questions about
the EOS and please do come in the
comments section below and i'll get back
to you as soon as i can i will probably
be trying magic lantern as well and that
says a lot of enough different OS that
you can put on this camera and it
unlocks a bit of bit extra features so
it's actually really good i want to try
it but i have no need for it at the
moment i'm going to get more time time
time time and yet let's do a quick low
light test two so i'll quickly turn off
the lights if my battery permits is it's
running really low so let's get it on
there so you can get a bit of auto focus
so the pancake lenses to they don't do
that well in the video I finally have
focused hunting problems that these
lenses actually do very very well in
video so that's what i find the pancake
lenses do take phenomenal shots in low
light I mean they're just take really
good photos so this one I just think
this is the 18 to 55 million lenses is
like the all-round beast there we go so
I hope you enjoyed this review and I
look forward to catching you guys at
some of my other videos here's our for
now wait</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
