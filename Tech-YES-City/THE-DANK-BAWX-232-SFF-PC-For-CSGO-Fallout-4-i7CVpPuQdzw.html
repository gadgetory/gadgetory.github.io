things up can I get a and yes in the
comment section please oh and don't
forget what the dang Fox can do that's
right playing games like csgo go to
getting some of those later cause like
fallout 4 let's take a look welcome back
at Tech whoa City this is Brian coming
to you guys today with a build that
y'all been waiting for the use price
performance stuff that is the Builder is
it the hack and slash methodology that
you came to see anyway whatever it is
let's just take a look at what parts we
have in this gaming PC the prizes and
then benchmark this ugly or beautiful
depends how you look at it in some games
and you
Oh
- then
with
there it is the dank box and that penny
mg 32:58 really performs a 4.6 gigahertz
them with the gtx 770 i think it is a
great combo of course you'll run into
games that don't simply work unless you
have at least four threads but for every
other game which I think gives the
majority of titles then you are going to
be absolutely fine csgo dota 2 fallout 4
and even the cod remastered all-round
superb I was actually surprised at how
damn good this little H 81 and ear zeus
board was the overclocking was really
impressive even those of erm wasn't the
best the options for overclocking on
earth were phenomenal you had load line
calibration phase control and the
current limits are all available which
helped get this thing to 4.6 gigahertz
in the dead heat of summer I did manage
the boot of 4.7 and run a quick test but
it was just simply too hard for me to
try to pump more voltage into this thing
so I will say the difficult
Gabrielle cooler that I picked up from
the junk store in Japan a while ago did
a fantastic job this time around it even
had a cross threaded bolt in there so I
could only hammer it down diagonally
with two screws but it's still a did an
amazing job nonetheless and of course
the case cutting into that with the
Dremel worked out pretty well
but I would have personally would love
to send this case extended or even
pushed up a little bit to officially
accommodate micro ATX board but
regardless it is a nice little case that
is lightweight and pretty sturdy though
fitting that massive 7950 that I got
with 992 ATX as well in the previous
vlog if you haven't seen already I put a
link in the description below but if I
put either of those cards in it would
have been really hard to accomplish so I
just stuck with the gtx 770 and so on
that note it did a really good job
staying pretty quiet even when it was
overclocked and this is on the reference
cooler so I think you guys will want to
see a showdown between the gtx 770
versus the r9 280x so get onto that
after the mammoth amount of videos I
already have in the pipeline but anyway
guys if you enjoyed this video to be
sure to hit that like button and let me
know what you think of the dank box do
you like this little thing I personally
like it even though the side panels off
and I wouldn't maybe hack-and-slash that
up too but
as fun as it is it's actually working
really well it's really quiet and does a
great job so hope you enjoyed this youth
price performance PC and I'll catch you
in the next one very soon peace out for
now bye
oh yeah claim of this man it's pretty
clean so I'm gonna overclock my head now</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
