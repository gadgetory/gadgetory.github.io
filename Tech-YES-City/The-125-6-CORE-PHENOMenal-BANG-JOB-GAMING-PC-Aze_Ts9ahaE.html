all over the world today we have a used
build all news parks price-performance
to the max and we're using a first ever
on the channel s6 core AMD phenom i pick
this up in Taiwan before Computex
started for about 15 USD now we've got a
gtx 660ti as well
got this off gum tree gantry for about
sixty Australian dollars and we've got
this in Triple P terms for about forty
five USD some of the other parts include
a om case which I'm going to hack up
here today that cost me like next and I
think I think I've used it from a
previous build so we're going to count
that as pretty much for free cuz you can
get one of these I'm sure anywhere in
the world - nothing nobody wants them
and we've also got a gigabytes of ddr3
memory pick this up for around $20 a
cheap used hard drive for around $8 and
we've got a power supply which I picked
up for free and I cleaned up in my 200k
special so without further ado let's
noodle eight this case and fiddle these
parts in and get the build ready
there's a free Windows seven key if
anybody wants that as always take care
you guys
so pulled all the rubbish out of this
build we can see here is just a bit of
crap that came off the PC itself so
another really cool thing I pulled out
of this build is an 80 plus bronze Delta
electronics power supply now probably
like this would be really good in a home
theater PC so I'm going to keep hold on
this thing and see if I can use it in a
future build and now moving back to the
case itself we've got the hard drive in
the bottom bay which put that back on
and we've pretty much got a bare-bones
set up so we can practically start
building this thing now and if I come
into any hurdles I'll let you know how I
overcame them
so we just got the power supply and that
was actually really difficult we had to
fly out bend this out cut out the top
and then here we've got this piece
hanging out so for you car enthusiasts
you can even have a rear spoiler on your
PC case now it is possible
so here it is completed we've just got
to do a bit of cable management now in
this case is so awesome I mean forget
about RGB forget about all these $300
cases with tempered glass
this is cosmetics right here we even
have a spot up here in the top right to
do a bit of cable management
check yes give me 110 percent and I
actually turn it off because noisy okay
so that's much better now what do you
guys have been following the channel for
a long time we'll know that this build
here incorporates the heart and soul of
tear gas city 110 percent of all use
price performance and the performance is
pretty good especially for the money I
paid now this thing set me back
125 u.s. dollars roughly or about a
hundred and sixty Australian dollars
when I tallied up the cost and honestly
for the money it performs really well I
was actually surprised at the
performance after I overclocked it and
that's a big thing here after I
overthought before I overclocked it I
actually couldn't even get into the buff
and change settings I went into the bars
but apparently it had an OEM buy off the
motherboards actually called the CM 1630
and it's an OEM version of another board
called the M 78 LT or something like
that so initially I tried getting that
bios and flashing it on to this one and
it wouldn't let me and then I looked on
the internet and someone made a hax
playoffs and so I initially tried to
flash that through easy flash - and it
didn't work on oh no I have to overclock
because when I started testing this
thing out initially not overclocked on
pub G the performance was pretty bad it
was like it was ok it could run the game
it was running it like 30 to 40 FPS and
then in a gunfight it just choked out on
me and that's really unacceptable
especially for people who want to play
games like multiplayer games like pub G
so I went back to the chopping block I
got a food dose I then force flash the
BIOS and this is a risky procedure
because I have bricked a motherboard in
the past doing this method it's an OEM
board a counterpart of a retail version
and you force flash it and it can't work
sometimes so I made a DOS bootable and
then force flash this BIOS and it was
really good after that
I could now overclock and the default
setting was 2.9 gigahertz for this
processor however the memory was only
clocked to 1066 megahertz so I
overclocked the memory to see
300 megahertz on all four sticks
overclock the CPU to 3.5 gigahertz now
this is a stock fan and I wasn't sure if
this thing was going to handle it all
the motherboard and after I did it I was
actually really surprised the CPU was
thinking that it was hitting 128 degrees
all the time so the fan just ramped up
full speed and the performance was
actually really good we're getting over
500 points in Cinebench really
impressive that went back into pub G and
now this PC was performing really well I
was getting over 50 fps at 50 to 60 fps
and furthermore in gun battles
it wasn't choking anymore so pub G
really good this is 1080p medium
settings so after that I also decided to
overclock the graphics card a little bit
now this is a 660ti and honestly for the
price I paid it is a bargain I mean 45
USD and I overcooked it on the core
about a hundred and ten megahertz and
also on the memory about 300 megahertz
now this info strike got me a graphics
score of over six and a half thousand
points that's actually really good a
1050 Ti for example gets around 8,000
points and that's a $150 graphics card
so this thing for $45 is performing
exceptionally well this cards are really
old card as well I think it's like four
years old now it doesn't only have a 2
gigabyte frame buffer the 1050 Ti has a
full GUI but you can definitely micro
that to give IV buffer in today's games
and when we went into dota 2 and started
micro in those settings so 1080p high
settings we're getting a hundred FPS we
switched over to csgo over 200 FPS 1080p
again on high and low settings on de
dust2 and then we moved over to f1 2016
a really recent title I decided to set
it to medium settings and now this is
actually a pretty well optimized game
and I was getting over 70 FPS on average
on this game so I was actually really
impressed by the numbers this thing was
pulling out and I know there's one game
that a lot of you guys are going to ask
me to test and that's GTA 5 so I decided
to test that out 1080p at normal
settings and I was happy to report this
thing was smooth at all times 60 to 90
fps
now the old Phenom are actually really
good CPUs I came into this wanting to
test it out especially
against those four chords e on the
eighth threat of the x34 50s I know
there are very popular choice but I will
say this if you can get a really cheap
am-3 motherboard in a six core phenom
they do perform exceptionally well in
today's games especially for the money I
paid $50 for the motherboard CPU and
also the cooler and that's a really good
bargain in my opinion because you have
to overclock the signal to get really
good numbers out of it but once you
overclock it the gaming performance is
actually really impressive so good old
phenom are still valid in a lot of
today's titles if you're willing to
overclock and lovely I will say this
computer was a lot of fun to build
especially since everything worked I
didn't have any problems really except
that BIOS updated did take me a while to
figure out how to get around that but
besides that a lot of fun especially
with dad man on the angle grinder and
then figuring out how to get it all to
fit I mean as I said before we've even
got a rear spoiler on this thing for
cosmetics so I'm absolutely loving where
this build is going I probably I don't
even think I'll put it in another case I
just like the way it looks honestly it
just represents what I'd be doing if I
was just getting into PC gaming and I
didn't have any money this is what I'd
literally be doing unless of course
you've got animals around the place or
you've got a young toddler running
around or something like that then you
might have to reconsider some life
choices and maybe go out and get like a
$50 case or fully laid out of it other
than that performance awesome build
awesome let me know what you guys think
in the comments section below about this
thing and I'll get back to you as soon
as I can
as always love your work and if you

what is cracka lackin ladies and
gentlemen shut up Birds I'm trying to
film after we did a 24/7 go on in the
