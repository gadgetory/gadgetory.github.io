going with the lights on
so people have been requesting for a
while for me to feature AMD parts and
today I am doing an all AMD PC for you
guys that can play Borderlands 2
welcome back to tech st this is brian
coming to you guys today with a special
all AMD build now this build came about
because I found a phenom x2 4 core CPU
in a bargain used PC that was lying
around one of the used stores that I
picked up for around about fifteen
dollars and then I also found an AMD
engineering sample graphics card this is
an X 600 in a junk bin for $20 so those
two parts together are going to create
one beefy PC and we're going to add in a
few extra components but but that being
said let's take a look at the past list
then we'll move on to the clamps and
also look at any problems that we come
in along the way and then we'll do the
benchmarks
so upon getting this case in and looking
at it closely I can see that there was a
proprietary power supply now the brand
name is windy and I've never even heard
of them before but I'm guessing that's
why I've never even heard of them before
they probably went out of business with
this model but anyway we've got here
actually a really nice case besides this
power supply though it looks like from
first glance I'm going to have to put in
a power supply manually into this case
since it is a very interesting case
design especially for something this old
I mean it's made of all lightweight
aluminium
and it can fit a full-sized ATX
motherboard inside so let's take out all
the parts and clean it up and test if
they work so now we're pulling this case
apart and this is really freaking cool
like windy where are you guys nowadays I
mean - this proprietary cable this case
is legendary I mean some manufacturers
could really take some ideas from this I
mean look at that it slides out now good
easy access to do the build now I know
why this PC is in the junk section let's
there the cool is busted so first up
here we're going to test the AMD
graphics card just to see if it works
and we can actually get a signal out of
it now I'm not expecting too much here
but hopefully this all work
okay come on hopefully the same boots up
and it is a stupid signal to the monitor
there from their signal to the Martha
then we will be home in Ho's
okay cool awesome so this graphics card
is now working so we're getting a signal
to the monitor which is really awesome
news because we can now use this in our
build so we're now going to try and boot
this pc up and see if we can get a
signal and we just have to hope and pray
that the CPU is not bricked because as
you saw that completely loose heatsink
you know if they started off enough
times and you get a whoa Wow okay I am
NOT going to complain about my luck for
a long time because that right there is
a lot of life
so there you have it you've heard
stories about it on the internet now
you're seeing it in the flesh this is
the zip tied down cool
after looking at this case more closely
I realized it is just simply
one-of-a-kind I haven't seen a case like
this in a long time so what we're going
to do is we're going to utilize this in
a build at a later date I'm thinking
like bigger graphics card
X 99
you
okay so everything is hopefully working
now and we're gonna put together the
same day oh and a PC and it's gonna
hopefully take us that's if my zip tie
get a job didn't break them city
you
so there you have it the AMD PC was
doing really well at both 1080p and 720p
even though Borderlands 2 was a little
bit too far ahead for this PC at 1080p
it still managed to play it perfectly
fine at 720p and yes I have never played
Borderlands 2 before but I'm going to
play it from now because it looks like a
really fun game and I admittedly didn't
know what I was doing
I just wanted to benchmark the game to
give you guys some figures however I did
have a lot of fun building this PC and
it's actually really interesting when I
got into the benchmarks on Cinebench I
noticed that the x4 was scoring like 375
points overclocked and when I compared
that to something like an 8 60 K at
least the benchmarks I'm finding online
this CPU from 2009 is beating it's a 4
core from AMD it's beating in 4 core
from AMD in 2014
anyway it doesn't matter this CPU I got
in the background here the Phenom x2 is
a really good CPU on a budget if you can
pick it up for cheap and also the
graphics card a little bit dated I would
have liked to have put in something
different though when I saw an
engineering sample I just had to jump
the gun because I've never seen an
engineering sample graphics card in my
life so this is awesome to have one
available to me and also benchmark and
show you guys the figures and then
looking onto the zip tying of that
cooler on the motherboard socket that
was probably one of the most dodgiest
things i've done in the history of this
channel and it worked and it worked
extremely well I mean the temperatures
were really good we got a good overclock
out of this CPU on a real mediocre
motherboard like this thing didn't even
have a heatsink on the v RM it's that
budget so I was really happy with the
overclocked results and especially with
the zip-tie cooler I mean we didn't even
get over 45 degrees and the spread was
absolutely amazing across all the cause
there so I was really happy with the
zip-tie job and I mean even though it's
a last resort I can highly recommend it
so and one thing I will say also with
the socket is that since it's a PG a
socket that's where the pins are going
into the motherboard I was able to get
away with sort of being a bit loose with
the pressure
so if you're doing this on an LG a
socket then be very careful because it's
a lot more sensitive than a PGA socket
in my opinion also one final thing that
I'll stress is that a lot of these
builds begin with the motherboard so if
you're looking to build a used PC like
I'm doing then just remember that it all
begins with the motherboard and now
today I did get really lucky again and
that the motherboard worked also the CPU
worked and even the memory worked in
this budget pickup so I'm looking
forward to the day where I actually have
problems because I seem to just be
getting really lucky as of late but
anyway that being said if you guys
enjoyed this build be sure to give it a
big thumbs up and if you have any
questions or comments about today's
building be sure to drop a comment in
the comment section below this is the
all AMD build and I hope you guys
enjoyed it and I'll catch you in the
next one peace out for now bye I just
got this G 100 s in and way too much
glue on the box terrible</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
