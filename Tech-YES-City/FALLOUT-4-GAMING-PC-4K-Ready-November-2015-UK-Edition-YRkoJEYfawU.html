over in the UK a massive gaming PC and
this thing should be able to run fallout
for probably at 4k
gentlemen welcome back to November 2015
this is brian coming to you guys today
with a massive gaming pc which will also
serve as a great editing rig as well i'm
personally using these specs at the
moment and i'm blown away i play games
at 4k with no problems also I'll be
putting the links in the description
below for Australia and the US as well
so don't feel left out and with that
being said let's get on with it so for
the cpu we're going with the 5820k which
is a 6 core 12 threaded beast and it's
overclockable as well now this comes in
at 274 pounds and it will just mince any
game or it will just cha through any
production you throw it it also the
great thing is is that this is cheaper
than the 6700 K which is only a 4 core
even though it has an IPC improvement
it's not really that big and it's
specially not worth the price increase
so for the cooler I'm gonna give you
guys two choices here coming in first as
an air cooler which is the deep cooled
gam acts at 25 pounds this is great
value for money though if you wish to
cool the Haswell a little bit more and
get those really high overclocks
then you can go with something like a
Corsair H 100 GD X so for the
motherboard we're going with the X 99
extreme 6 now this comes in at 172
pounds and it's pretty much the best
value for money motherboard that I could
find it's got a Tim sockets there to fit
in up to 128 gigabytes of ddr4 memory
you've also got an amazing onboard audio
they're not just with the headphone out
but also with the mic in it is important
if you want to record and do streaming
and things like that and then you've
also got dual and IC support on there as
well so you can choose between the end
is the Qualcomm I think and the Intel ni
C's so for the memory we're going with
two eight gigabyte ddr4 sticks of
kingston memory now don't worry about it
being dual channel it will just run
absolutely fine plus you've got the
option there to add in more memory in
the future and a lot more of it as well
so this comes in at 78 pounds and it's
pretty decent value for money so for
storage we're going with an SSD here
from SanDisk this is a 240 gigabyte
solution and it is going to be fast
snappy and reliable and it comes in at
58 pounds represents great value for
money so this will be your main
drive and you'll be able to put those
games that you play a lot on this drive
as well also now for the secondary
storage we're going with the Toshiba 2
terabyte 7200 rpm Drive since games are
just getting so big nowadays you'll want
another drive there to put a lot of your
other games on there and as well serve
as a backup drive if you need to now for
the graphics card which is easily the
most important part of any gaming rig
we're going with the MSI 980ti which
comes in at 530 pounds now it is a bit
expensive however this card is currently
king of the hill and MSI's custom
solution is quiet and will do a good job
of keeping that graphics card cool plus
you'll be able to overclock it and get
even more performance out of this card
now for the case to house all that
hardware we're going with the very
popular NZXT s340 which is just getting
rave reviews all around the net for
being pretty much great value for money
in that it has good build quality great
cable management options there it's also
got things like USB 3 on the front as
well so you don't have to worry about
anything and you've also got a spacious
room inside there to fit your graphics
card with ease now for the power supply
which is another very important part of
any gaming rig we're going with the EVGA
g2 850 white gold rated pass play this
is modular as well as the fact that the
fan is very quiet and you have a 10 year
warranty thrown on top of this all that
495 pounds it does represent pretty good
value especially when you're getting
into quality power supplies which is
what you're going to want to put on this
rig as well as the option there to SLI
in the future if you wish to which is
another important thing for future
upgrade ability so that leaves the total
of this bill - thirteen hundred and
forty five pounds I've also included
those PC pop pick a links there for the
people in the US and also check them out
even though the prices rules vary
because the
see the difference anyway guys that's
about it if you have any questions about
this build throw a comment in the
comment section below and I'll get back
to you as soon as I can and if you like
this video please give a big fat light
and I'll be coming back to you guys with
more tech news and reviews peace out for
now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
