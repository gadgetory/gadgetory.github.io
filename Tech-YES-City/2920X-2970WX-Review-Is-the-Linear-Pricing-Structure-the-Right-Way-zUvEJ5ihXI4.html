CPUs introducing the thread Ripper
lineup from AMD this is the 29 20 X with
its 12 cores and 24 threads coming in at
650 US dollars or if you're in Australia
1019 AUD comes with a base clock of 3.5
gigahertz and the turbo of 4.3 gigahertz
and then they've got the 29 70 WX 24
cores 48 threads coming in at 1,300 US
dollars or in Australia 2040 AUD with a
base clock of 3 gigahertz on all cause
and turbos up to 4.2 gigahertz however
how do these compare against the current
stack of thread Ripper chips out there
namely the 29 50 X with this 16 cores
and 32 threads and also the 2990 WX with
its 32 cores in 64 threads well today
we're going to take these four thread
Ripper CPUs and compare it against the
2,700 X and also the 9900 K and the 79
ATX II and also overclocked them to what
I consider generalized overclock levels
to find out how well they perform in
both productivity and gaming benchmarks
welcome back to take you are sitting
right here on the test bench we are
using as rock boards across the whole
lineup whether it be the fatality or
gaming lineup on the X 399 pacifically
we use the fatality gaming board with
quad-channel memory with 32 gigabytes of
flair X 32 hundred megahertz CL 14
timings on the dual channel
configuration we still used the same
four sticks but of course it will be in
dual channel configuration we use the
Nano max cooler on the thread ripper
chips and then for the Corsair chips we
use the H 15 i probe anyway pulling up
those productivity scores first we you
guys we have the blender results showing
what the best-case scenario for the
thread ripper chips can be in an
application that can utilize all those
cores and threads within 2990 WX coming
out in front followed by the 2970 WX
Intel's chip the 79 80 XE still is
performing quite well slotting into the
results quiet nicely but I feel like the
29 20 X and also the 29 50 X kind of
represent a bit better value for money
here and then of course the 9900 K and
also 2700 X still doing very well moving
across now to Adobe Premiere Pro which
does paint a different picture which is
going to be important in the conclusion
of today's video because we can see here
that the Intel CPUs are winning in terms
of their core and thread count this is
because Intel have put money into Adobe
for them to optimize their software for
Intel CPUs AMD CPUs are still yet to
catch up with the 2950 X pretty much
being the max utilization of cores and
threads here after this the 24 core and
also the 32 core WX variants don't
really take advantage of those extra
quart and thread counts so essentially
if you're buying one of these WX chips
for the Adobe suite you'd be wasting
your money in my opinion then move over
to Cinebench which is the multi-threaded
benchmark showcases the max theoretical
performance of these chips 2990 WX does
do very well then the 2970 WX and also
the other thread ripper chips do scale
in tandem to the amount of cores and
threads they have moving right across to
the single threaded benchmarks this is
where the Intel chips do pull ahead
especially in the case of the 9900 K
with its higher single-threaded clock
speed as well as a slightly better IPC
in the movie across to v-ray another CPU
simulated benchmark this is where the
thread Ripper also the WX and even the
experience do score very well in
relation
their core and thread counts with the
2990 WX coming out on top followed by
the 29 70 WX and then on to the last of
the benchmarks here which does paint an
important picture in relation to the WX
versus the X chips and this is the
compression benchmark where we can see
the 29 50 X and also the 29 20 X pulled
ahead of the higher court and
thread-count WX brothers and this is
because they both utilize quite channel
memory and in the case of the WX chips
they link the dies together and they'll
each two channels off a to die as
opposed to the X variants which leads to
channels off of one die so we can see
here the memory is a limiting factor on
the WX in certain benchmarks and it can
be to the point where actually
bottlenecks the WX chips and they
perform less than the lower court and
thread-count variants this has to do
with the higher core counting threads
being hungry for that information but
being limited to the amount of data they
can pull through the memory itself the
Intel chips and also the 2,700 X do
quite well in this benchmark and then we
move over to the decompression
benchmarks and this is where I feel the
2970 WX does very well where the extra
cores and threads on the 2990 WX don't
do as well in relation to the 2970 WX so
it is good to see the 24 core 48
threaded chip doing very well in this
benchmark as well as the thread Ripper
and AMD chips in general pulling some
really high numbers so now we finished
the productivity benchmarks we'll
quickly sum up what's happening here the
WX chips are mainly for civic
applications that can utilize all those
cores and all those threads and that
quad-channel memory isn't going to limit
all those calls and all those threads so
if you're this person looking for this
CPU and you know you can utilize that
extra power then one of these CPUs will
represent good value for money but I
feel like for most people especially
power users whether you're using the
Adobe suite or you're streaming gaming
and doing a lot of tasks at the same
time I feel like the 2950 X does
represent the best value here and I feel
like the 29 20 X here and also the 29 70
WX for that matter are a little bit
overshadowed by their higher core count
variant brothers which scale in a linear
price range so you're not getting
rewarded for having those cut-down cores
on the thread Ripper dies in this case
usually when it comes to CPUs that are
at the absolute top and
have that flagship CPU they usually
command a premium for getting the most
performance out of them and ultimately
when we compare this linear pricing
structure of the 29 20 X to the 29 50 X
and also the 29 70 WX to the 2990 WX I
feel like you're not getting rewarded
for missing out on those cut-down dies
and that usually you get a discount
whether it be a GPU or a CPU in the case
of for instance an rx 570 versus an rx
580 you're getting a more of a discount
but you're not getting the performance
cut that you would in that price
differential if this is making any sense
and then we've got the other costs
associated with that as well the X 399
boards the coolers and all that other
jazz which then brings the total build
cost in favor of getting the 2950 X or
getting the 2990 WX and then of course
we have the Intel counterparts which
we'll talk about that later in the
conclusion after we rolled the gaming
benchmarks first up here we had csgo
1080p lowest settings this is mainly for
competitive gamers who need a
ridiculously high draw frame and they
don't mind playing at low res apparently
that helps them see enemies easier and
so in this case the 9900 K is doing the
best here but all the other chips are
still doing very well you're gonna be
out of competitively game on all these
chips shown in the graph and then when
we move it up to 1440p we can see the
results really come down to a small
differential here and that feel like me
and you like playing with higher
graphical settings on higher res
monitors and want to enjoy yourself then
it's not really gonna matter which CPU
you pick out of this bunch move it as a
Sanskrit origin however does paint a
little bit of a different scenario where
the 2700 X out of AMD's lineup is
performing the best and then the thread
ripper chips don't do as well the Intel
CPUs are coming out in top of the 9900 K
coming out best here and the movie wrote
of 1440p just like csgo
saw the difference being cut down yet
again and then move over to the dota 2
probably one of the most competitive
games with the biggest prize pool in
terms of tournaments getting high FPS
here is pretty important but the game is
capped at 240 FPS so what we saw at 1080
P lower settings was the 9900 K doing
well and also all the other chips were
doing very well too and then go into
1440p the RT x 2080 TI was not being
held
pretty much at all besides some 1% lows
which did throw out the numbers just by
a little bit compared to 1080p lower
settings but it is important to note
that these differences again are on a 20
atti which is pretty much the best
gaming graphics card out there not to
mention it's the Strix model which does
perform very well anyway the last of the
gaming benchmarks is GTA 5 where at
1080p lower settings the numbers on the
9900 K with such high FPS ashley effects
this to the point where it's apparently
breaking the engine of the game and that
causes the 1% loads to be lower due to
induce stuttering the other chips here
do very well very smooth experience
scoring better 1% lows then move over to
1440p highest settings we see the
differences are cut down dramatically to
the point where you're gonna have a good
experience on all of these CPUs
regardless of what GPU you have and now
here we are with conclusion time with
the fourth red river chips on the table
also some Intel counterparts when will
you want to go with AMD when will you
want to go with Intel well as we've seen
with the graphs and then we look at the
pricing structure the only thread ripper
chips represent phenomenal value for
money through and through then you will
look at the Intel counterparts that do
have their merits as well if you're
looking for something that it'll do well
in the Adobe suite or if you're looking
for something that it's going to be the
best competitive gaming CPU then the 79
80 XE and also the 9900 K are going to
do very well but they are expensive
chips at least compared to the AMD
counterparts but when look at the 29 20
X and the 29 70 WX we can see that
they're stuck in this weird
juxtaposition compared to the other
chips that Big Brother's naming Lee in
their pricing structure and this is what
sort of puts me off a little bit with
these chips I mean if you know that you
need this amount of cores and this
amount of threads for that application
and you're going to utilize this value
for money out of these chips then go for
it but if you're looking for sort of the
best in slot CPU for your X 399 board
then I'd rather go with the 29 50 X or
the 2990 WX that's just my opinion but
because you don't get a discount with
the 29 20 X or the 29 70 wx4 losing
those calls and threads it's in a linear
pricing structure and since you're
already getting a motherboard and a big
cooler and a power supply and all that
other jazz
think you would be better suited in my
opinion with going with that bigger
brother and getting that better
performance whether it be the best in
slot quad channel memory 16 courtship
the 29 50 X or the best in slot 32
course 64 threaded AMD 2990 WX they're
my two choices coming out of this and
then there may be the argument of while
I need more PCIe lanes and they offer 64
PCIe lanes which is a great benefit of
the thread ripper chips but if you need
that many PCA lanes and you don't care
for the performance of the CPU too much
then the 1900 X still represents
phenomenal value money that's coming in
at under four hundred US dollars and
still gives you access to all those PCIe
lanes so that maybe a CPU that you may
wish to consider if you need that 64
lanes of PCI usage but throwing another
curveball into this conclusion makes it
a little bit difficult here because the
29 20 X I do like it if you are into a
placeholder CPU for instance if you can
pick up a cheap X 399 board that's still
a very good quality and you want to hold
out for the 7 nanometer chips then this
12 core 24 threaded CPU definitely could
be for you I do like it in that sense
it's the cheapest 2000-series chip and
in my opinion I like the CPUs on the
2000 lineup whether it be Rison or
thread ripper a lot more than the 1000
series I think AMD has done a great job
in reducing the latencies so that may be
one reason why you'd want to go with the
29 20 WX chip if you are in the market
for it but when we compare them to the
Intel counterparts AMD thread ripper and
also Rison chips represent phenomenal
value for money through and through but
one more elephant in the room I guess
people are going to bring up is the
overclocking on these chips when it
comes to workstations and overclocking I
have my workstation here it's
overclocked I over clock it in the
winter the summer doesn't matter I
always get stable over clocks because
I've got good gear and I know how to get
those stable over clocks without
inducing crashing on my machines but
anyway in the case of today's video I
took these CPUs to what I consider safe
and decent over clocks and they're
generalized overclock and maybe the 9900
K is a little bit aggressive at 5
gigahertz but keep in mind this is
stable and what I've got here is
apparently a silicon loser and at least
when I compare it to what other people
are getting but regardless that aside if
you are on a workstation on you are a
single end-user then I recommend
overclocking people have critiqued me in
the comments and laughed at me even for
having a workstation that's overclocked
but I've been using this thing and all
my rigs before it in the last few years
and they've all been overclocked and
I've managed to get 4k videos done day
in day out and the benefits of
overclocking versus not overclocking has
saved me a lot of time so I'd recommend
it to anyone
if you have good gear and you can take
some time out to learn the settings
which will end up saving you a lot of
time in the long run especially if you
wish to keep these CPUs for a few years
but do keep in mind of course the
negative of overclocking is that you
will get increased power consumption and
as we can see with all these seven chips
that we've tested here today the power
consumption does go up with overclocking
and in the case of the WX chips they do
start to balloon out a bit so you will
want to get a really good cooler really
good power supply and really good
motherboard if you do wish to overclock
any of these chips seen on the desk here
I'd say the 2700 X is sort of an
exception you can get this out of the
box with a be 350 motherboard even two
very good levels and it won't use a
whole lot of power anyway in a nutshell
I do like the 29 20 X and also the 29 70
WX I just feel like they're a little bit
overshadowed by the linear pricing
structure for instance I would like to
see the 29 20 X dropped from 650 US
dollars to say 600 or even 550 US
dollars and then the 29 70 WX from 1300
to 1200 u.s. dollars I think this would
represent a great value for money
proposition and would reward people for
taking the cut down dies and getting
that extra value for money anyway let me
know in the comment section below which
chip would you go for out of the thread
Ripper lineup or would you just go with
the 27 hundred extra 9900 k-love reading
your thoughts and opinions as always and
also if you're feeling a little bit
adventurous might want to get some tech
ES City merch or if you enjoyed the
content coming out every single day
might want to jump on the patron
bandwagon for as little as $1 month you
