5650 I was surprised there was met with
a lot of positive feedback in the
comments and people said I want to see
more vlogs like this so today I'm gonna
be testing some our RAM with seven
different kinds of spray paint sprayed
on it to see if spray paint effects
circuitry and does it short-circuit your
computer components that's one thing
you're going to be testing and if that
does indeed succeed then I'm gonna be
spraying some oil based lubricant on the
actual PC and seeing if that short
circuits as well is something I want to
know these two things anyway let's get
on with the blog
so this is one of the rigs that I
recently built in my 500 old workstation
build guy this is the cheaper of the two
this was the hundred dollar rig and
unfortunately it doesn't function
properly in that four of the RAM slots
are actually faulty and that they don't
register the RAM in Windows though the
first two slots do register the RAM and
so I can put like four gigabytes of
memory in there though even at those
speeds that kind of the performance
really sucks so I figured with this PC I
should just I'm going to do some testing
that you know if it doesn't work then
I've got nothing to lose kind of thing
so I wanted one thing I wanted to notice
spray paint or kind of short-circuit
your circuitry and so what I've done
with this memory of us sprayed on seven
different kinds of spray paint so on the
right we got like white gold silver pink
black and white no I've just sprayed it
all on made sure I've got it on the
circuits there and so I'm just gonna put
this memory and save the computer boots
up so let's let's have a look we've got
the memory installed there the spray
paint memory is here in the first
channel and the we just got another
memory slot in there just to give it to
you about some memory so it doesn't take
two years to boot but anyway let's uh
let's fire that up and see if the spray
paint memory works with a nice rainbow
blend of spray paint on there let's have
a look okay do we have a signal okay we
don't have a signal there's no signal so
I mean nothing's like nothing's frying
at the moment like nothing's frying so
there's no sparks or anything like that
but we're not getting a signal at all so
let's just switch or just take the spray
paint memory out and see if it boots and
we get a signal
taking out the rainbow so here's the
rainbow here we've taken that out and
we're just gonna try and boot up the PC
this time and let's see if we get a
signal this time oh well okay some kind
of a
different noise cracking this top we we
we have a signal okay
this Rainbow Warrior does not work
that's confirmed so I guess that answers
that question that's the first question
I wanted to notice spray painted
circuits can you spray paint circuitry
and the answer's no I mean mind you I
did use seven different kinds of spray
paints so I mean one of these might work
but I'm not gonna risk or try my luck
but the good thing was it didn't like it
didn't fry anything like it didn't
short-circuit anything so we're just
gonna try and spray some CRC now on this
rig like let's just do this while let's
just do this while we have a signal here
so let's just then we got the signal so
we're just gonna grab some of this this
is the CRC 556 so let's just spray a bit
on here
okay so there's a CRC 556 lubricant that
has been applied
nothing's frying we'll just try and
reboot the computer to see if it's all
functioning normally got it like yeah
it's dry it's dripping like it's
dripping off the heatsink whoo let's
just go let's just reset it okay okay do
we are we getting a signal so we've
pretty much caked the oil-based
lubricant on and it's booting fine it's
it's fine so yeah I mean I thought the
oil-based lubricant wouldn't do you know
it's not conductive anyway so that's not
a problem I just needed to know that
because when I clean on my computer I
like to clean it up with this stuff and
so yeah it's good to know that I don't
have any anything to worry about there I
mean we're just try and just quickly
spray it in the RAM slots there yeah
okay nothing's happening so that's
pretty cool
so I answered two questions that I
really wanted to know so we'll just go
to a quick conclusion okay so in
conclusion sorry I had to put on a mask
because it stinks in this room so in
conclusion I don't spray paint spray
paint on your circuitry as we saw there
the RAM stick is now pretty much bricked
though one good thing was that it didn't
like short like fry anything so I guess
spray paint has a capacitive effect
rather than a conductive effect on your
hardware if I believe that should be the
case but this stuff here like you can
spray CRC 556 on your hardware to clean
it up and that won't have any effect at
all I mean I caked it on as you guys saw
and it didn't do anything like the
computer was still running perfectly
fine so let's conduct some more
experiments on a $100
cheapy so anyway guys if you like this
video please give it a thumbs up if you
have any questions about anything we did
in this vlog today the please drop a
comment the comment section below and
I'll catch you in another tech video bye
this is the part that really shocked me
because the most expensive pair of
glasses did not perform that well
and this is coming from a company that's
called gins in Japan they're very
reputable company and these were pretty
much like these are almost $50 so
expensive but they were inferior to the</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
