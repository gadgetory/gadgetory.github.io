over the states have some absolutely
amazing deals going on i'm going to
point out my favorites for you and also
build a whole computer in the process so
even if you don't have to build a new
computer there are some wicked deals in
this video today so let's get on with it
so punching on straight to the chase
here we have the first deal this is the
ASA 1080p monitor which is seventy
dollars 70 freaking dollars for a 1080p
monitor is a tan panel so it's got good
response times and ace are known to make
monitors with pretty low input lag off
the get-go so it's going to be a great
entry-level monitor for someone looking
to both have fun or be competitive as
well so for 70 bucks well this thing's
going to sell out quick thirty dollars
for a mechanical keyboard from Rose
world is the next item of half here like
well if I was in the states and I wish I
was I'd be snapping up all of these and
then like eBay and have something for
profits so I'd get on that quick of all
you guys thirty dollars mechanical
keyboard awesome next deal we have up
here is a logitech g400 to which is an
amazing mouse especially for thirty
dollars it's going to do a great job of
playing FPS and RTS since it is sort of
a medium sized mouse more of a palm grip
mouse but it's going to be a great mouse
anyway you're going to love this thing
in your certain especially with logitech
they know how to make mice and they do a
good job since it got very low input lag
anyway let's move on I'm running out of
breath here because it deals are just so
goood okay let's go FX 6300 and ninety
dollars six core processor overclockable
yeah what else is there to say it's
going to do a great job of playing games
at 1080p especially for $90 pretty much
some of the best value you can get out
there at the moment on a cpu I love it
at this price put it in your cart and
put that in your basket again next a
deal we got here is the r9 380 this is a
graphics card which for 170 dollars is
again a bargain especially since you've
got apparently a 30-dollar rebate there
which you can take advantage of now or
when you get the graphics card and then
get 30 bucks back so that will make the
whole total 140 dolls for graphics card
of this caliber very good value for
money get on that quick I mean this is
gonna do a mighty fine job of playing
games at 1080p awesome card for the
money love it let's get on with the next
deal I gotta take a moment here to get
my breath back 500 watt power supply
from EVGA twenty dollars after that
twenty dollar movie you can get it for
forty dollars be a giver 20 more mail in
rebate going to do a fine job of
powering all these components today no
problems you got an fx c300 there and an
hour 9 380 so it's pretty good
just get it twenty bucks damn next deal
we got here is an AMD 970 motherboard
which for sixty dollars is frickin good
value as well now by a star I have had a
biostar motherboard in the past and it
has worked that's all I can say this
one's got 9 reviews already and they all
seem pretty good so I'd take the gamble
on it looks pretty good especially for
sixty dollars it's got it looks like
it's got a decent vrm on it as well so
you shouldn't run into any problems
there especially its stock settings if
you want to overclock maybe look into
that a little bit more but it should do
a good job of running the FX 6300 next
deal sixty dollars for an SSD 240gb
bytes of SSD storage as well freaking
amazing deal get on that that's going to
boot up all your games gonna book boot
up your OS mighty fast and then let's
get on to the next deal here 16
gigabytes of ddr3 memory for $65 now a
lot of the games coming out now are
using up a chunk of storage a gigabytes
is still kind of the sweet spot but hey
16 gigabytes for $65 you can't go wrong
brother okay let's move on to the next
deal here thermaltake we all know
they're ripping off everyone else's
cases but at $32 who cares let's get
this case because it's just such a
bargain for today and $32 it'll fit that
graphics card no problems and it comes
with USB 3 on the front I don't think
this is actually a ripoff model to just
don't buy the rip-off models that's all
anyway $32 for a case bang we're
finished that brings the whole total so
if you guys get this build I did the
tally it's like five hundred and ninety
seven dollars after the rebates so
that's a whole build now if you want to
get windows head over to reddit i'll put
the link in the description below for
that you can get windows for like 10
bucks and yeah you get an OS for free

dollars and something that's going to be
1080p and it's going to run it perfectly
