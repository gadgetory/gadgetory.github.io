the HyperX butea joined by mock and he
has a very special produkter to announce
as well yes we are announcing our first
headset under fifty dollars in our
opinion this is the best gaming headset
under 49 99 and the reason I'm saying
that is for not just because I think
it's a great product because there are
certain features on it that are better
or comparable to almost any other
headset at this price point so we're
basically taking the mobile call the
HyperX DNA the basic features that are
on all of our cloud my headsets we're
using our ultra soft ear cups ear foam
we have it may look like just as basic
plastic headset but it's not it includes
the metal and so you have a better
durability as you can make use of it
taking along off your head slamming
against the wall whatever you happen to
be doing when you play games its a 50
millimeter drivers on a tilt so it gives
you a good angle into the ear very good
son quality and as far as the microphone
is concerned we added a unique feature
different from our other products that
it's a fixed Mike but it's a mute off in
up position and down position into a
microphone so basically from our opinion
based them over so far it packs the last
two days everybody thinks it's good or
better than anything else around 99
bucks well actually I try to recently
just before actually very comfortable
and the sound is actually really good I
noticed is that little spike in the
trouble there you've got that energetic
sound coming out and for fifty dollars i
must say you guys will have a winner on
your hands i think i was speaking before
is it due to come out on october 10th
yeah it's in the October time frame i
don't know if i can say the exact date
today but yet sometime in october you'll
be seeing these everywhere and said
that's on pre-order on amazon at the
moment is it will be pre order early in
october and available later on in
october were everyplace else so that's
the sting of guys now when I was a
teenager I used to be a stinger myself
so I might be picking up a pair of these
just for the name sounds good to me yeah
great
alright so now we just joined by Mark
again from hyperx and now they're
releasing a keyboard with the stinger
head said yes this is say roughly same
time frame both are in October this is
our very first gaming keyboard that
we're selling to the marketplace two and
a half years ago we started getting into
the headsets we now have four different
types of headsets on the market when our
nexus 7 surrey line is now keyboards so
with this is the cloud a low FPS keyword
yep so that's the cloud alloy FBS
keyboard and now we're talking about
cherry MX blues on this bad boy yes this
is the first product they're coming to
market is cherry MX blues I we're not
limited to blues but we felt that it was
a good product to start with for the
gamers and then we'll probably expand
out to two or three other colors next
year as well well definitely the right
switch choice i'm a big fan of cherry MX
blues as you guys know best switch out
there at the moment I wouldn't have it
any other way we've also got red
backlighting on this keyboard y and a
steel backplate included Yeah right wait
we have the the backplate we also have 5
profiles I can show you in a few minutes
in addition to that since it's for the
gamer there's a carrying case to put it
so you throw in your backpack you don't
get it all scratched up so it's a very
basic product for the market at around
about 99 bucks but it gets launched in
october but it's great for anyone that's
doing any kind of portable gaming and if
you're doing CS co or if you're doing
any kind of FBS you sometimes you want
to set the keyboard to the side and more
roof of the mouse perfect for that yeah
definitely i get the take with hyper
axes they're bringing very good value
for money to the enthusiast tax scene
with the peripherals the keyboards the
headsets I mean I guess they utilize
that economies of scale they're
definitely going to be hitting the
market hard with the fifty-dollar
headset and also now a $99 keyboard with
cherry MX switches included so stay
tuned for that yeah so I think that's
great that you can stop by and visit
packs fantastic if you have any
questions look at it said hyperx gaming
com visit high brix damn you know tom
guys and check that out we're also going
to have hopefully on the channel will
see us doing a review coming to you guys
and possibly a keyboard review as well
so stay tuned for that and if you guys
like this video you have any comments
either for me or mark to be sure to drop
a call in the comment section below and
i'll get back to you as soon as I
and stay tuned for the next tech video
piece up and out by
welcome to the Kingston booth I am
joined here by mark we going on bloopers
I just received a savage 64 gigabyte USB
thumb drive i'm gonna use this actually
quite a lot yeah i hope so i'm a fanboy
now because it transfers 4k video in
seconds so that's like an SSD based USB
yes it's a really fast down we've got
like a lot of different products coming
out from hybrid yes we do not just I
mean we've already we've been in this
business for a while so we do make
memory and we do make us be so we're now
getting to a keyboard so you never know
guys you might actually get the shirt as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
