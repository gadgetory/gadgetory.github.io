there is my main rig I used for video
editing 64 gigabytes of ram 8700 k GT X
1080 ta and of course three RGB fans
they really make performance go that
much better but it's a special day
because this rig right here I'm gonna be
departing with it and you're probably
wondering like why why would you be
departing with it because right there we
have the build that is gonna take its
place
that is X 79 Xeon 1680 v2 and ddr3
memory now after I complete this build
I'm gonna be conducting a heap of tests
comparing the 8700 K to the 1680 v2 and
we're not looking at just a Cinebench
school Cinebench score is is overrated
it just does it tells you as a
theoretical max best-case scenario if
that program in a perfect world could
use all those threads which we know it's
not a perfect world especially when it
comes to software and there's actually
other things that Cinebench doesn't tell
you like latency and that's one thing
i've been delving into in the last few
months so we're gonna build this pc then
we're gonna compare it with a thousand
FPS camera against the 8700 k and see
what differences we can extract at a
micro level yeah I think no milli level
because it's milliseconds
so today's gonna be the sort of
preparation or the prologue to the next
video where we'll be changing over my
main rig to the 1680 b2 in other words
we're upgrading our hardware from new to
use price performance I know a lot of
you guys gonna be loving that hitting
that thumbs up button because this is
going to mark a new journey plus a
statement as well for me personally a
lot of people criticize me of you know
flipping and sort of pushing people to
use price performance and not using it
myself so I figured well what better way
than to start editing 4k videos and do
my whole workflow on use price
performance and so what we're going to
do now is I'm going to get a case for
this whole build and nothing is better
than my opinion in the air 540 so I'm
gonna go pick up one of these I've
actually got to build a PC for someone
as well it's gonna be picking up two air
540s and also some other parts as well
I'm gonna be meeting up with the king of
the coast and we're gonna go get those
parts he's got to go get some other PC
parts as well so it's gonna be a little
cool vlog that you guys are gonna come
through with us today and see but in the
meantime I do have a massive rubbish
pile here and yes that is a shoe in the
rubbish pile as well because those shoes
are so dirty and that is an as rock
pillow behind that and they're a sponsor
of the channel good old as rock but with
all that aside let's go jump in the yes
'mobile and get things done
and now we are back at the lab the
studio the one and only now with two air
540's so favorite case of all times the
air series I love these cases so we got
one here gonna build out and then one is
gonna be the main rig which is gonna
start building out as well so two builds
gonna get done but also while we were
out there was some hustling that was
done right on the road so we went to
Brisbane to pick up these cases because
and that's like about an hour drive
because the Gold Coast store had none in
stock and I couldn't be bothered dealing
with the people on the coast and king of
the coast actually wanted comfort
drivers us and of course we're just
looking at deals as we're going to
Brisbane always on that hustle and grind
and we found a PC an x79 PC of the sale
and it was a pretty good price 650 and
so we went over there and it was a Diego
was a really nice guy we met up with him
he had a few pcs up for sale he ended up
throwing in a power supply for nothing
he said there's a little bit of wine so
I have to check that out in Kenya fix it
I pulled the cooler out of this and also
over here I got the x79 saber-tooth
motherboard so we kind of did a deal and
I sort of pulled this out I got this and
the cooler for 150 Australian dollars
but it did have a little bit of a
problem with it I think some of the dim
memory is not being recognized so I
don't know if this is a common problem
with sabertooth motherboards might be
somewhat of the PCB in the middle may be
bent down over time and the traces I
don't hit the CPU entirely not too sure
but we will check that out but whatever
the deal is this price for this
motherboard was ridiculously good ko TC
also ended up getting another PC with
the 280 X and an i-5 65 or 6400 and he
got that for 450 AUD so I ended up sort
of just going in for the motherboard
because I did the haggling and all that
and yeah now we're gonna put something
together and see what comes out of this
so it's now the next day and we've got
the main rig finally setup except it is
missing one little thing and that is
this right here
the 16 atv2 we just got this in the mail
so I Gregg from science studio I got to
send this to his house and then he then
forwarded that on to me because the eBay
seller who was selling this wouldn't
ship internationally so got that big
thanks to Greg we're gonna put this
thing in now this computer and then
we're gonna see how it performs so now
we're just finished putting these zeon
in and there's one more element to put
in this rig and since we did have a HD
60 pro capture card in there before
we're actually gonna be upgrading to the
4k 60 Pro so Elgato were kind enough to
send this out and this will essentially
enable some of the gameplay captures and
also some of the captures of the
benchmark rig or other rigs that I hook
up to this PC to get 4k footage now so
the quality of the videos when I get
capture footage will just be that much
better so this card here is about double
the price of this here the HD 60 pro but
of course you're getting over doubled
the capture with 4k 60fps so it's pretty
much the best of the best
now it does run across HDMI so you will
have to make sure that your cables have
the bandwidth to handle 4k 60fps if you
wish to choose that setting but also as
well that the interface or the graphics
card that you're running off has hdmi
2.0 support too so here they are
side-by-side and you can see that it's a
lot bigger and a lot heavier so there's
a lot more hardware going in the 4k 60
Pro but also the PCIe lanes looks like
it's using up double the PCIe lanes that
this is 1x this is 2x by the looks of it
so we're gonna drop this in the PC now
and see if it works because the box says
it does need a 6th gen Intel or better
and I mean the dizzyland we're putting
in the 1680 v2 is actually much more
powerful than a lot of six genin four
core CPUs so hopefully we can get it to
work if it doesn't we'll do some
troubleshooting and so we can get out of
this thing so here it is now the final
look at the main rig we're just actually
overclocking the x79 right now 4.6
gigahertz low latency memory I think I
got it like eight timings with nine nine
twenty four so a little bit not as what
I wanted on the ddr3 but not to worry
this rig here we're gonna do a quick
before and after with this just to show
you guys what's gonna happen around here
quickly but also as well I have done
some testing a thousand FPS on this rig
which I'll be using to compare with the
x79 behemoths here we are now after ten
minutes on the 1680 V 2 at 4.6 gigahertz
and we have a successful run here so the
temperatures are staying under 70
degrees really good since the fans are
on the auto noise profile - so Ivan even
set him at a static percentage the power
here it's using up about 180 watts and
Emma decree temperatures are about 22
degrees so this thing is really really
doing well so the ivy bridge-e 1680 v2z
on that is soldered as well from the dye
to the lid so it's just got everything I
want to use some GC extreme as well
using the H 110 I from Corsair so these
temperatures really well controlled
let's run some benchmarks
No
it's nap master flex which has got the
16-day TV too on the sabre-tooth which
isn't as good as a motherboard we were
getting for around 1.25 volt and that
was with 4.4 gigahertz so that was going
really well at those so you can see the
diminishing returns really kicks in
after 4.4 gigahertz or 4.5 gigahertz on
this particular CPU and so what we're
gonna do now is try and go for four
point five to see what temperature's and
what speeds we can get because another
thing as well as we've got a HX one
thousand powers apply here which is
really good especially for low ripple
and we've also got pretty much the best
multi board you can get on x79 so we've
got a 50% load line calibration which is
essentially helping so the highs there
you've got three different settings
you've got the height 50% and that's
allowing us to get these same voltages
was setting in and that's because it's a
really good motherboard and really good
power supply in combo so this combo is
pretty much the best for overclocking on
water and air and the temperatures are
really well too but let's see what 4.5
you go that's gonna be done at and to
the right of me now is the finished
build it is looking really good it's
also performing above my expectations
this Z on the air 1680 v2 it is really
good is legit x79 motherboard as well
it's got all those features that I'd
want USB front out I also got a plethora
of USB ports at the back and the BIOS is
so good to work with I sort of missed
these old school biases that just have
all the options and all the descriptions
and everything to just get to
overclocking nowadays it seems like
biases have all these fancy fans and RGB
control and I kind of missed this bias
right here it's just really the best of
the best it's just so many options I
can't stress that enough
this case is well the f5 40 I absolutely
love this it is my favorite case of all
time it flows really good and also the
noise is really low too and the capture
card I've got that working as well nvme
2 terabyte drive is working as a boot
drive too so big thanks to the stranger
on the internet who posted up that
modified bass I know a lot of you guys
want to see me
get nvme booting on older platforms I
will look into that and see what I can
do in terms of how to get that working
maybe make a tutorial for you guys and
now the last thing I'm going to talk
about with this rig is not just the
price performance but also the
performance so I did pick up a heap of
deals and the 1680 v2 that is a little
bit expensive people are gonna look at
that and they're gonna say okay costs
about the same as an 8700 K and you're
really getting the same performance when
you look at some of those simulated
benchmarks but when it comes down to it
this build isn't just about that price
performance like I could have got out
and used the x79 board that I got in
Japan and I could have used a lot
cheaper parts in this build and made
something that came in really low and
came in really hard in terms of value
for money but for me it's also about
getting the deals on something like this
is Zeus motherboard which is the rampage
is literally like the best board you can
get on x79 using that and doing what I
think in theory should be possibly the
best in slot CPU and multiple combo to
this date so that's gonna be coming in
part two and I can't wait to actually do
those numbers myself and research
everything but so far so good I'm really
enjoying this rig even after being on
for a day and I hope you guys enjoyed
this video if you did then be sure to
hit that like button and if you have any
questions comments about this PC I don't
even know what I'm gonna call it needs a
name still but I'm always open to
suggestions but this is a part one
concluding pretty much the prologue
where I've done the build showed you
guys some tees some performance numbers
but in part two I'm going to be making
the comparison against the 8700 K and
I'm gonna be going over the nitty
gritties I'm not going to be focusing on
things like Cinebench scores because
there's so much to tech than just the
Cinebench score and that's what I'm
starting to realize in the last over the
last year when I've been testing a lot
of different CPUs out and also test
driving them as my main rigs for a few
months at the very least so this rig is
going to be my new main rig for how long
I don't know
but it's already that snappiness it's
already taking me over and I'm loving it
and I hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you did then be sure to hit that like
button and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
