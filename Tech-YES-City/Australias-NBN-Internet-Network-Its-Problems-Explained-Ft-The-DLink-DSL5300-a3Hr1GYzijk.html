rolled out all across the country and
it's known as the NBN aka the National
Broadband Network and now I recently
just switched over from my adsl2 plus
connection which was very slow by the
way the speeds I was getting was about
10 megabits per second down and one
megabit per second off and I know right
tried doing a YouTube channel on one
megabit per second that's what I've been
doing for the last year it's been
brutally rough to get videos up I
usually just uploaded overnight went to
bed and then woke up and the video was
finished and I had to actually drop the
quality of my videos to account for that
now we fast forward to February 2018 I
have now been connected but my speeds
are only 14 megabits per second up and
40 megabits per second down which
compared to the rest of the world is
actually quite bad especially for a
first world country in 2018 so what is
going wrong with the NBN well today I'm
gonna explain four major factors that
could be affecting your connection with
the NBN as well as detailing this new
modem that was sent in via d-link which
we're going to take a quick look as well
so let's get on with it
welcome back to tag yes City this is
Bryan and the first reason why your
internet could be slow especially if
you've just hooked up to the NBN is a
thing known as ft T n fibre to the node
which originally when the mbm was
planned they were going to roll out
fibre to the premises that's where they
have the node which is usually about
anywhere from a hundred to two
kilometers away from your house they'll
run from that node then fibre to your
house and that will essentially mean
that the big internet hub in your city
you'll be connected to that via fiber
the whole way however in this case the
government decided to save money so they
rolled it out to the node from the major
hub in your city and then from the node
they rolled out well they actually used
the existing copper lines and then from
there you got internet so if those
copper lines are really old then your
speed could be degraded even if you live
quite close to this node however another
thing is if you live quite far from the
node you will get attenuation and that
will affect your speeds in my case I
live about 800 meters away from the node
and so I originally plan to get on a 100
megabits per second download speed and
40 megabits per second upload speed
however those plans have been changed as
in my case it's actually the distance
which is affecting my internet speeds
handsomer than getting 40 megabits per
second down and about 13 megabits per
second upload speeds however with that I
can change now my internet plan which I
originally planned for a hundred down
and forty up I can drop that down to 50
down and 20 up and save myself some
money every month and not have to worry
about changing speeds because I'm
theoretically capped by the copper line
running to that node now there are some
other existing acronyms out there for
technologies as HFC which is hybrid
fiber coaxial cable this is Telstra's
existing optic lines and they are
actually quite fast you'll generally
find that there are a lot better than ft
T n in your area there's also ft TB
which is fibre to the basement if you
live in an apartment block and of course
there's FTTP
fibre to the premises and fixed wireless
in the area where the distance is just
too far to lay any fiber out in the
ground this is usually in remote areas
so that's the first reason you could
be experiencing problems if you live too
far away from the node or if the actual
copper from the node is so bad to the
point where your internet speeds get
affected now the problem is here as well
is it's not really fair for the average
Australian guy someone who really needs
the Internet could live far away from
the node like myself and get affected
but then someone who lives really close
to the node might not even want to use
the internet at all and yet they get
much better speeds than I do so you can
see why now Australians are complaining
even just after the first reason but
let's move into the second reason why
the NBN speeds could be slow in your
area and that is data provisioning from
your internet service providers so
basically your internet service provider
will contract with the NBN and get
allocated a certain amount of bandwidth
now of course some networks are known
for pricing really cheap competitive
rates and then over provisioning what
the bandwidth they purchase from the NBN
in this case you could get throttled and
it is known that some Internet service
providers do overload the network and do
throttle their users and in that case
you might want to change network
providers especially if you can get into
your modem settings and configure
username and password and you've got a
friend on a different network you may
wish to try out their username and
password just quickly to do a speed test
and see if your speeds are different if
they're a lot better on your friends
network then you may wish to think about
changing your network in my case however
the internet speeds don't change
throughout the day and the beauty of
this modem is it actually tells me the
maximum download and upload rates
achievable so I have nothing to worry
about with my current internet service
provider so that could be the second
reason let's move on now to the third
reason so now here lies the weirdest of
the problems in number three
since ft TN + ft TB use existing copper
lines Telstra I believe which owns a lot
of the copper lines do give clients one
year to change over from their existing
landline telephones and also adsl2 plus
to the NBN Network however within that
one year if someone using the existing
telephone line complains of high-pitched
noises running through while they're
trying to talk to someone then Telstra
are obligated by law to then go to that
node and throttle it so the high-pitched
whining noises will go away so in this
case you may notice that your internet
speeds are really good
and then the next month they're just
terrible and this is the case it's just
a matter of luck you just got really
unlucky so you'll have to wait it out
until that years over and then they can
up the speeds again so that is probably
the most unluckiest of the problems I've
mentioned here today and there's really
nothing you can do about it because it's
Australian law however if you do notice
your speeds dropping out you can within
the modem itself and this is going to
sort of be number problem number four
sometimes the networks do get throttled
and your modem has a setting called
SRA or seamless rate adaption and now
this is sort of tying in with this
problem but also the sometimes the
networks will get throttled from being
over provisioned and so you can turn on
a setting called SRA and it will adapt
automatically to the slower rates hence
not dropping out your internet
especially if you're watching Netflix or
you're doing something really important
it could be a business conference call
and so this setting is actually crucial
if you don't want your internet dropping
out but you know your network is prone
to being throttled either by the ISPs or
if it's being throttled suddenly by an
unknown thing like Telstra capping the
solution for you anyway the great news
is all that aside I am grateful for
having a better internet connection then
I had before I now I have 13 times
better upload speeds than I previously
had so uploading videos is now a lot
better and also this modem here sent in
by d-link is the DSL 5300 it has eight
bands eight antennas which are high gain
antennas so they do give out a pretty
strong signal there's also three bands
for the wireless two of five gigahertz
one is 2.4 gigahertz the 2.4 gigahertz
generally has a bit more reach than the
5 gigahertz signals however this 5
gigahertz signals allow you to carry
2167 megabits per second as opposed to
the 2.4 which maximum speeds are
theoretically 1,000 megabits per second
now all three of these bands can be used
simultaneously hence why they advertise
the speeds as I think 5337 hence the
5300 in the name of the modem however
theoretically for a single device with a
single wireless connection
you really can only expect maximum 2167
megabits per second unless you've got
some crazy technology that bridges three
Wireless ports together in that case
you'd probably just want to spend the
money and get a faster wireless device
itself but also on the note of Wireless
some people complain about dealing
modems having cheap components and the
internet dropping out on the wireless I
did experience this problem myself
however I don't believe it was the
hardware inside at least this specific
model what I found was when I went to
the Advanced Settings in the wireless I
had to turn off roaming assistant once I
turned this off my wireless connection
was absolutely fine and didn't drop out
at all so I actually don't know why that
setting is enabled by default I would
like to see Deerling fix this because in
my experience everyone on this house in
this house was complaining to me and
saying the wireless was dropping out in
the Telstra modem we had before was not
dropping out please fix this so I did a
little bit of trial and error and I
found out it was this exact setting that
was causing the problem however on the
note of the wireless signal itself it's
a very strong signal coming in with a
better signal than my previous adsl2
plus telstra wireless modem however it
should since this retails for around 750
Australian dollars so that's a lot for a
modem and a router solution all in one
however you can pick it up off eBay for
around about 650 Australian dollars
currently and the good news is is that
it does have extra features like the QoS
or quality of service scheduling however
I will complain a little bit about the
QoS service it's mainly a simplistic
service it doesn't give you any advanced
options like specific speed throttling
on devices which I would like to see in
a future firmware update or future
reiteration of this modem especially the
firmware update at the moment you can
only have three different priority
levels where for instance I can put my
computer on high priority so that gets
allocated mostly bandwidth and I can put
everyone else on the medium setting not
that I would do that but this modem
allows you to only do that with the QoS
however there are a lot of advanced
features as well with this motor so you
can find you in this
modem with a lot of the advanced
settings however me personally I'm happy
with these speeds this thing is
delivering and of course the build
quality itself is quite good and also
before I get on out of here this modem
features a USB 2 port for a printer if
you want to attach a printer to it and
then share that around the whole network
and also a USB device for a USB Attached
storage which can then be again access
throughout the whole network so I was
pretty impressed with this modem however
it is quite expensive for what it is
though I have heard that a lot of other
people are doing some advanced testing
with it and they say that it will
extract the best speeds possible on the
NBN so if you guys are in an area where
you can get really good speeds from the
NBN then this might be the modem for you
just being keep in mind that it will be
quite expensive especially for what it
is though it is a really nice modem and
it does have really nice Hardware built
in for instance like the quad-core
cortex CPU and also the ability to
isolate your network with a guest
network as well so if you run a hotel
business and you've got your own private
living quarters at the hotel then you
can separate the guest network from your
own private network too so nice little
modem great touches and also the NBN I
hope you guys enjoyed the explanation on
what Australian internet is like what
some of the problems you could be facing
if you've got poor speeds at the moment
and you're on the NBN and with that guys
if you enjoyed the video - be sure to
hit that like button and let me know in
the comments section below
are you on the NBN or what internet
speeds are you getting in your country
love reading your thoughts and opinions
as always and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
