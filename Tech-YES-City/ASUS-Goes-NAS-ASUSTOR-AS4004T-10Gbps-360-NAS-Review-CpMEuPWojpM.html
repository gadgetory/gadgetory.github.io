for bein asked from a Zeus tour that's
right you heard that right a new
investment division from a Zeus tech
that makes motherboards graphics cards
all that goodness you used to and you
may even want to think of it as as you
store going a little bit different but
it's coming in at a really hard-hitting
price of three hundred and sixty US
dollars for based solution hot-swappable
supports raid zero one five six and ten
today we're going to configure this in
raid five and take you through a little
tour but if you're in astray it cost six
hundred Ozzie dollars now what makes
this so phenomenal in terms of its price
performance is the fact that it's got a
ten gigabit per second Ethernet switch
on board so you can use this for so many
more things than just simple file
transfers to and with those speeds you
can get much faster than your one
gigabit per second or one hundred twenty
five megabytes per second and with the
drive configuration we're using four
Seagate iron wolf pro six terabyte
drives and these are configured as we
said before in a raid five essentially
giving us three times the speed of a
standard hard drive but also giving us
backup in the form of parity across all
four drive so if one of the drives drops
out we still have all those files backed
up very interesting solution fantastic
for a Soho or even a small network at
home but when it all comes down to it I
think as you store files this solution
could be the best fit for a lot of
people out there in the audience let's
explain why
welcome to tacky-ass city and here we
have this little unit here it's actually
on at the moment and you can probably
hear how quiet it is the editor in the
background their use of his actually
using this at the moment and it's in
operation and that's how quiet this soar
benefit of that is you can manually
change the fan speeds in operation hot
swap the drives as we said before but
you can also create individual users
with ease limit their access privileges
of read and write operations or
read-only and DEA privileges with the
hardware inside you've got a Marvel
dual-core CPU 2 gigabytes of RAM and you
may be thinking ok the specs are a
little bit lower than what I'm used to
on an ass but I'm here to tell you that
this thing is so quick it's snappy it's
actually more responsive in my opinion
than the QNAP nice that we've recently
tested and that was boasting much higher
specs at least with it's a gigabytes of
RAM this thing is really quick it's
smooth on all devices we've tested it
you can use it from a smartphone whether
it be iOS or Android can also use it
from Linux Windows or a Mac computer
itself so it's got all the
configurations are readily available the
UI and feature set is so simple yet does
have all the features I would want from
an aspir sley the ability to distort
manual apps they've got a heap of
different apps to choose from as well
plex media server things like security
surveillance and you can hook up to 16
cameras up to this device at once not to
mention you can customize the GUI with
your own colors themes or even logos if
you're a business and back to the
hardware itself three switches through
one gigabit ports and also an
aquaintance your 10 gigabit per second
Ethernet cable now if you've only got a
1 gigabit per second switch but for
instance you've got a 10 gigabit nic in
your computer that you've been pouring
from build to build since 10 gigabit per
second switches can be very expensive
but you still want to get faster than 1
gigabit per second speeds then you can
aggregate all three of these NICs
into one and get essentially 3d bits per
second speeds both over your switch and
through this Nass itself and then to
your computer with its tangu bit per
second nic and you also get a three-year
warranty in the dimensions are 24
centimeters by 33 by 21 weighs in at 3.5
kilograms without drives installed it
also is a complete tooless installation
and you can remove the front cover with
ease that is magnetic
- so now moving through some of the more
intricate features with this nest you
can remotely access your files via when
address by setting up a user login you
can also individually map separate user
profiles as well as controlling LED
brightness and you can actively monitor
pretty much everything from different
computers all at the same time up to a
total of 512 connections to this NASA
itself it also supports xqz and you can
change the different hibernation
settings where the power consumption
itself is around fifty to sixty watts
when all four of these drives are in use
but on hibernation it goes under ten
watts power consumption which is very
impressive so you don't have to worry
about leaving this thing on it will do a
good job of still using little to no
power even while it's in a standby mode
you know the schedule is for daily
weekly or even monthly health checks or
even scans to optimize the drive
themselves to make them faster it also
give you a readout of the drives
perceived health and how much life it
has left so if you need to change it out
before it drops out you can do so now
with the little azuz thought there is no
wireless built in itself so I do
recommend if you get it something like
this hooking it up via a switch and then
having a wireless access point connected
to that switch that's of course
essentially Wireless now and now lastly
with the AS 4040 I really like the
robustness of this device you can use it
as a file storage server you can use it
as a surveillance camera App Center you
uses plex media server or you can even
just watch movies directly off it saving
you the need to have a home theater PC
as demonstrated when I hooked it up to
my LG TV and just access the NASS
through the web browser on that TV I was
able to play my favorite movies and
files with ease and it worked absolutely
fine it's also got a built-in VPN app so
you can use it across your network as a
VPN and it also supports live
transcoding so if you wish it to be
working for you while sitting idly
dormant but now it's time for the
conclusion 360 us this is the best thing
I like about this device it's coming in
with a 10 gigabit per second Ethernet
switch on board it also supports the
three link aggregation but moreover the
UI is so simple to use it's going to be
a great and perfect solution for those
budget-conscious but pretty much want
the best value when it comes to a soho
Nass and really when it comes down to I
can't really critique anything about
this device at all except maybe the side
of three limits of the transfer speeds
themselves not being able to fully
saturate the tank occur bits per second
connection but again at 360 u.s. or 600
ozzie dollars is that really going to be
something that you're looking for in a
unit so cheap but ultimately when it
comes down to it build quality it's
quiet it's just packed with features so
easy to use bang I love this thing it's
actually going to be replacing the QNAP
here which yeah that's how much I like
this thing and big thanks for a zoo
store for sending this unit out for a
review also big thanks to Seagate for
providing the hard drives installed in
this unit as well the six terabyte hard
drives are really high-quality I've been
using the 10 terabytes here on the QNAP
device and there have been flawless the
whole time this thing has been in my
studio so there are units that I can
recommend if you want to check out more
details then links will be in the
description below and that's about it
really guys I hope you enjoyed this
review if you did then be sure to hit
that like button let us know in the
comments section below if you have any
questions or comments about the azuz
tour is 4040 and i'll get back to as
soon as i can
also there is two USB 3.1 as well which
you can plug drives up to directly and
transfer files to the nasa that way or
you can hook up a printer to it if you
wish to but also there's no vga outputs
as well so you will have to access this
device through your switch router or
computer directly and it does hook up
directly to computers with ease - very
simple to use as opposed to other NASA's
that I've used in the past they have
been a little bit difficult to hook up
directly to computers more so than hook
up to a switch anyway I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
but let explain but letting azuz tech I
says we've tested here you can use it
from a smartphone whether it be a
Android or shut up whistle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
