up this is part 3 and I am going to be
building all these tables putting a rig
down here putting a 4k monitor down and
putting the PlayStation 4 down here hell
I'll even put a Super Nintendo down here
the stuff we're going to build this
chair and the desk and sort of orientate
how everything's going to go in this
room and then I am going to bring some
parts downstairs and we're going to
start making the 4k gaming rig as well
oh here's the chair and it's finished
and it's in all its glory so it's got a
bit of a red black theme going on which
is going to match the whole desk and
chair set up and also the computer setup
as well but the best thing the reason
and the main reason I got this chair was
because of his back rest in the middle
here it's actually really good for your
posture when I sat down and the chair
was only about seventy dollars so it's
also got like a head high rest there as
well so it's a full office back chair so
really cool i'm looking forward to
playing games in this working chair as
they call it here it was they're really
easy to set up it's pretty much just put
it on its back there get four poles
screw four poles in finished
alright so here it is so we've got about
three meters of death space here all in
the corner and we're going to start
setting things up booyaa and there's a
little chair ready to go okay so we have
all the gear set up now I'm just pretty
much putting my stuff where I want to
put it and I've got like the preamp
microphone preamp the mic there the
second monitor which is going to be for
the playstation 4 we've got my rig setup
there we've got my 4k monitor there and
you can see that there's like my TV set
up and stuff so it's really messy you
probably see all the retro consoles and
games there's something another project
in its own but we're going to get all
this cleaned up and then we're going to
make it look beautiful
you
so here's the final setup in all its
glory and I hope you guys have enjoyed
this now all the materials cost probably
around about four hundred dollars though
I did add a few extras in like I did get
some sofas in this room I did get a new
tripod and camera and also I mean
everything's come together now so this
is going to be the new setup that you
guys are going to see all the video is
on so anyway with that being said we're
going to move across and I'll show you
the hardware that I've got here as well
we'll quickly take a look at that and
then we'll finish up the video ok so
let's take a look at my main rig here
we've got an x 99 asrock fatality
motherboard and in that is a 58 20k
which is six core 12 threaded cpu
clocked at 4.2 gigahertz now cooling
that is the animax t40 now this is
actually the Black Edition though I've
used the fan that comes with the silver
edition and resprayed that red because
it's quieter and now on this we've got
16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory from crucial
though as you can see there I put some
black heat sinks on that just to make it
blend in better then for the cabling
we've got some cable extensions there
which are red and black sleeved and that
is connected to a super flower power
supply which you have she can't see
visits kind of at the back here hidden
away that's an 850 watt platinum power
supply now it's a very quiet power
supply it's been working fine so far
since i installed it so no problems
there the 980 TI is the hercules x3 from
inno3d which i've recently reviewed
beast of a graphics card and then for
the drives we have in here we have the
crucial 256 gigabyte SSD that's the MX
100 we've got a western digital one
terabyte blue and we've got a crucial be
x 100 which is a 500 gigabyte hard drive
now the headphones i am using the
Fidelio el ones so these are my favorite
headphones I love them they're great
all-rounders and I've touch that with a
V mode of boom Pro which makes it
essentially a gaming headset now this
case a lot of people have been asking
about the case this is the arrow cool
strike x
and it's essentially a hybrid case it's
like a open test bed / your own case and
it's done really the concept is amazing
and I'd love to see more case makers
make a case like this though they did
miss a few things like this side here
bends down and sort of the build quality
throughout the cases like there's just
things that are really good then there's
things that aren't that good I did a
whole review on it but overall it's a
really nice case though I do love it and
the fan here is a really big fan is a
20-centimeter fan that stays really
quiet so I don't know if you can pick
this case up anymore but it's actually a
really nice case for what it's worth now
over to the left here we've got the
peripherals and also the monitor so this
is the ace at x b 28 280 HK from asa
this is a 4k monitor and it's a really
nice 4k monitors the team panel as you
can see there the viewing angles
actually really good for a tan panel and
the response times are so crisp so 4k
gaming has never been better this
monitors awesome i highly recommend it i
actually got to do a review on it still
but as you heard there it's actually
pretty good so if you think about
pulling the trigger on one of these
babies then i can definitely recommend
it based on my experience so far we've
got there a razer goliathus mousepad and
on top of that @ g 302 which is my
second favorite mouse I still do love
the g3 just that little bit better in
terms of ergonomics but it is a really
good Mouse if you're into sort of a I
don't know what they call it nowadays I
just called the claw grip where I
grabbed it like that so we've got
editing software I'm actually editing
this video for you guys but I've just
decided to take this and put it in so we
go there cherry MX red keyboard that's
great for games and then at the back
there we've got also the bay ringer
xenyx 802 preamp and then over here
we've got a red and black chair which
you guys saw in part two and then over
there we have a 1080p acer monitor and
that's for tech gaming weekly and also
for the police station for we got soft
boxes and then all the way over here we
have a 80 2035 condenser microphone and
then to the right of all that we've got
a toshiba full HD 1080p
the TV which is 32 inch I don't need
anything bigger than that as I don't
watch a lot of TV she their destinies
going at the moment so and then below
that we've got a surround sound system
from Pioneer the retro cabinet there
which has got a nintendo entertainment
system in it and also a super nintendo a
playstation and a nintendo 64 so that's
about it for today guys if you enjoyed
