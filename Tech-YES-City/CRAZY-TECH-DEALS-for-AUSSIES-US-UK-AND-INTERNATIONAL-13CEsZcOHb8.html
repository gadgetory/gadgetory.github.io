likes deals for instance a $10 450 watt
power supply from EVGA and also if
you're in the u.s. there is the GTX 1080
finally back in stock for 510 us at
least in this cryptocurrency mining
craze it's not a bad deal if you want to
get into high-end gaming and then the
live deal is a four terabyte hard drive
from sigue going for a hundred bucks
however let's take a look at some
international deals and also deals for
my fellow Aussie you down under welcome
back to tech yes City and as you saw in
that intro we had some cool deals for
the guys in the states and also if
you're international at the moment there
is a H 55 motherboard on Aliexpress gone
for 45 us now you couple that with
avionics 3450 for around about $35 and
you've got yourself one really potent
combo not just for gaming before so
productivity on a budget now we're
starting to serve up the main dish and
that is for my fellow aziz with 20% off
on ebay you can currently get some
really good deals that come in cheaper
than some of the really already
competitive online retailers in
Australia for instance of risin 5 1606
core 12 threaded CPU you get this for
260 Australian dollars delivered to your
door now if you need a motherboard for
MSI have a be 350 going for around one
hundred and eleven dollars after you use
the coupon code but what about a
graphics card to couple with your new
CPU where you can actually get the GTX
1080 for around about 680 Australian
dollars which makes it a really good
deal especially in this current crypto
mining crease where all the Nvidia cards
and AMD cards are getting sold out or at
least the higher-end cards to be used
for mining so you get in with a deal and
you can start gaming today or if maybe
you're a minor I'm not going to go there
don't worry there's also the MSI gaming
experience which does have a custom
cooler and a fatter PCB so if you want
to get quieter noises and generally
lower temps then that's around about $70
more expensive than the gigabyte variant
thing often though if you want the
absolute highest end graphics card the
GTX 1080 Ti is currently available and
you can get this for around about $1,100
after a discount the cheapest one I
could find on static ice for the
twelve-hundred so you can save $100 if
you want to get into the absolute
highest end gaming performance only that
will do fine at 4k resolution too so if
you need some storage as well to go with
a new build and crucial MX 300 is also
on sale going for around about 124
dollars after the coupon code is uses
275 gigabyte Drive really good on the
performance because I've actually
reviewed this model in the past and the
MX 300 does a great job of being fast
and also affordable now if you need a
power supply for your new deal then
antec have a 500 watt power supply going
for forty seven dollars after the coupon
code is use I actually purchased one of
these myself as I love using them in
budget build and even for a gtx 1070 or
even a 1080 this power slave will be
perfectly fine so what if desktops
aren't your thing well there's actually
the HP 250 series laptop with a 15.6
inch screen and a 500 gigabyte hard
drive and a dual-core going for 310 au
delivered to your door really good if
all's you want to do is write a few
documents in Microsoft Word browse the
internet or even just watch some movies
on the go this thing will have you
covered however if you don't want to
watch movies on a 15.6 inch screen and
you want to step up your media game then
there's the sony bravia 55 inch HD r 4k
TV going for around about thirteen
hundred and thirty dollars posted to
your door in crazy price in australia
for a really good TV like this from Sony
I'd be buying one of these things if I
have the room I'm currently confined to
pretty much what is known as a shoebox
but in the future I'll be definitely
getting something like this if I can
afford it
but what about my viewers over in the UK
well there's currently two deals I could
find on Amazon and one of them is for 16
gigabytes of ddr4 memory from course
they're going for 125 pounds which I
believe isn't too bad for a 16 gig kit
with current ddr4 Ram prices being quite
high there's also a gtx 1050 2 gigabyte
model going for around about a hundred
pounds so if you want to get into gaming
on a budget then a gtx 1050 will do a
great job of playing those titles at
1080p and guys hope you enjoyed today's
video if you did then be sure to hit
that like button and let me know in the
comment section below what was your
favorite deal out of all these that i
presented today love reading your
comments as always and also if you found
some other good deals
to share them in the comments and I'll
update them and add them into the
description remember there's only a few
days especially for the Australian deals
and a lot of these other deals that I
presented you will get sold out pretty
quickly so you're going to be quick on
these and also be subscribed and turn
the notification bells on because when I
do release these deal videos a lot of
them quickly gets sold out and if I
guess I'll catch on another tag video
very soon peace out for now bye
oh now also if you're in the market for
a new graphics card I believe that's a
Vegas 64 780 dollars that's a deal right
there if you want to get scalped over
golf</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
