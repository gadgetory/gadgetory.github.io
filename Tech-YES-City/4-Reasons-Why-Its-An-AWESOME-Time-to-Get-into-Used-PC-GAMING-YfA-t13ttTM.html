videos on why it sucks to get into PC
gaming at the moment and Greg from
science studio made a video on the
economics involved in that and why GPU
prices are the way they are Paul from
Paul's hardware however made a video on
just in general why it sucks in relation
to ddr4 pricing and also GPU pricing and
why it's not really gonna come down
anytime soon the video in ways was a
negative outlook and I completely agree
with both videos it does indeed suck to
get into PC gaming at the moment if you
are buying new PC parts so today I'm
here to give you guys an alternative to
that and we're gonna look at some use
price performance and deals that you can
get so strap yourselves in and let's
jump aboard the yes libido welcome back
to tech yes City this brand coming to
you guys today with not just an
alternative to the hostile market for
new PC buyers but also an alternative to
the way we think about economics now in
Greg's video he showcases a model on
perfect competition and this is a
fantastic objective model but the
problem here is that humans are anything
but objective a lot of the times we are
very subjective and this relates to our
emotions and in turn that relates to
consumer behavior and now with consumer
behavior it's a very tricky thing and
this relates to what we're prepared to
pay for an item which in ways is
directly related to demand for an item
however what we're prepared to pay and
what we actually pay for an item are two
separate things have you ever seen
someone in an electronic store for
instance being not prepared to pay
something but eventually being conned by
a salesman and then ended up paying more
than not they'll prepared to pay this is
because the subjective or the emotional
side of the human allowed him to be
conned into paying extra money than what
he was prepared to pay and also
ironically enough what were prepared to
pay for an item is also directly
correlated to the innovation in that
particular field for instance if we were
prepared to pay more money for a CPU or
a GPU and also more people were getting
into enthusiast technology you would see
higher gains year-over-year than what
we're currently seeing however you look
at the GPU market for example what we
are seeing is a substantial increase
year-over-year in terms of graphical
performance this is because the increase
in enthusiast PC gamers has increased a
lot in the past few years however I
won't just stop there this next part
segues perfect
into the rest of this video and now with
consumer behavior and what we're
prepared to pay for an item is sometimes
overshadowed by supply or how much of an
item is in stock for instance if there's
too much of an item in stock we as
humans will perceive that as not being a
good deal and we can procrastinate and
then sometimes check back and the items
completely out of stock so this is a
factor that can stop you from getting
good deals when I hunt for deals I leave
out human emotion I'm prepared to pay a
price if I don't get it for that price I
go on to the next deal however unless
that's a gtx 690 then i went crazy in
one of my recent parts for that though
another example of this is the first
reason of my 4 points that i'm gonna
make here today and this is motherboards
in the use price performance sector on
aliexpress you can currently get AP 55
gigabyte motherboard for 55 US dollars
shipped anywhere in the world
it's incredible value for money when you
couple it with a Xeon X 30 for 50 for
example this is just over $30 it's a 4
core 8 threaded CPU with decent IPC and
at overclocks really well now ddr4
prices although they're ridiculously
expensive in a moment ITX build I did
rant about the prices there are three
hundred and fifteen dollars for a 32 gig
kit and I paid 115 dollars for that same
kit a year ago but with ddr3 memory
which is a generation beforehand the
prices are a lot less costlier for
instance you can get a 4 gigabyte stick
going on Amazon for $20 delivered to
your door so that's 40 dollars for an 8
gigabyte kit this will serve you really
well in a budget gaming PC and here's
reason number to grab his cards yes
cryptocurrency miners are snapping up a
lot of the new graphics cards however
cryptocurrency miners also demand
efficiency if something is not power
efficient and there is one better
graphics card out there there's more
power efficient for mining they will
generally take that grab a scar and that
graphics card will be in high demand so
with the older generation graphics cards
they're not as power efficient as the
newer graphics cards and a lot of people
want to upgrade to the latest and
greatest and with that we can get some
really good deals on gravis cards for
instance I just took a quick look I
could get a gtx 960 4 gigabytes for
probably around 100 Australian dollars
if I put in an offer that's around 80
USD for gigabyte model that will serve
me really well for gaming if I want to
play pub G at 1080 P overwatch or some
other competitive titles this gravis
card will serve me really
nicely a lot of my other budget bills as
well I've looked at graphics cards
spanning from r9 290x is the GTX 780 s
and they're all really good grammars
counts for the money I'll put some links
in the description below for you guys
and here we are with reason number three
everything else new is actually pretty
good for the money
and in fact since there's a lower demand
due to ddr4 memory prices storage for
instance cases power supplies and
coolers are actually pretty cheap at the
moment for instance if you're in
Australia you can get a cougar power
supply in case for $69 and actually the
included power supply the 500 watt power
supply I've tried this in the past and
it's exceptionally good value for money
for what you're getting so if you guys
are in the market you can pick up some
new parts and just know that you're
getting very good value for money you
get a one terabyte hard drive for just
over $40 you can get coolers for $25 and
also you can sometimes get decent 430
white power supplies for $20 and now
we're gonna get into the final reason on
why it's a good thing to get into the
used PC market and this is quite simply
overclocking when we look at a brand new
8700 k just tested this cpu out it went
to five gigahertz however out of the box
it will turbo up to 4.7 gigahertz in a
lot of cases so you're not even getting
a 10% boost in performance from your
factory clock settings however let's
rewind it back to the older generations
that I've talked about here today the
p55 and in particular one of my
favorites the x58 sometimes we can get a
40% boost in performance by overclocking
so if you guys do have a bit of time and
you want to learn how to overclock you
can gain some serious benefits from
overclocking on the older gear and with
that it will make it a very good
experience for instance the Xeon x34 50
that I mentioned you can sometimes
overclock these to 4 gigahertz on
25-dollar coolers and couple that with a
gtx 1060 for example and not only will
you be at no detriment on this cpu
versus a new cpu but you also have a
really good experience for the price and
performance that this thing will offer
anyways before I get on out of here I
went on good old gam tree and I pulled
up some deals this literally only took
me ten minutes to do and what I found
was a whole PC that I could piece
together if I called up all these people
so we had a build here for theoretically
around about 400 Australian dollars it
cost you around 300 US dollars and we've
got a motherboard cool
and CPU for around 80 Australian dollars
now we can change the CPU over 2 and Z
on X 56 70 which costs around 50
Australian dollars and then there was a
gratis Carter GTX 960 for gigabyte
they're asking $120 but I sure could
have dropped in an offer of a hundred
since they're negotiable and I reckon I
would have got it and now for memory
there's one guy selling to different
sales of ddr3 memories selling 14
gigabytes in total and since the x58
motherboards have six slots we could put
in 12 gigabytes of memory and would be
kitted out and ready for gaming I reckon
I could get this memory for at least $70
a strand really good deal now k some
power supply $69 brand-new from Newmont
we don't have to waste any time their
hard disk drive someone selling one for
$30 brand-new we could probably even get
one of these for a little bit cheaper if
we tried and then that brings the total
to 402 Australian dollars that's if I
just went out hunted this I could build
this PC and then start overclocking it
today
and that's about it for today if you
guys enjoyed today's video then be sure
to hit that like button and let me know
in the comments section below if you
agree or disagree with today's video
also if you're new to tech yes City then
there are a lot of people in the comment
section that can help you out if you
need tips on getting into use
price-performance well you want to buy
some new parts and you've got to build
list a lot of people in the comments are
very friendly around here and with that
said I'll catch you in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
