much requested video and that's how to
overclock your graphics card so today
I'm going to be using my GTX 1060 gaming
X from MSI and I'm going to be
overclocking this graphics card taking
you guys through a step-by-step basis so
the first two things you'll want to do
is download the program's MSI
Afterburner and also UniGene heaven so
put the links in the description below
so those two programs but let's get on
with it
so after you've installed both these
programs I want you guys to open up msi
afterburner and now in this program
there's going to be a heap of different
options that come up but don't worry
about that I'm going to be guiding you
guys through each of these settings and
giving you my own personal tips and
tricks on how to deal with them so now
this mechanical will here I want you
guys to left-click on that and I want
you to left-click start with Windows and
also start minimized and then over on
the unlock voltage control I want you to
left-click that and then go up to the
fan tab here so left click on that and
then left click enable user-defined
automatic fan control because what
happens out of the box with a graphics
cards and fan curves is that they're
generally set pretty low and that's the
load noise however with that low noise
and the low fan curve profiles is that
what we get is that the grabs card will
be running hotter and when the grabs
cars running hotter because the fans
aren't pushing enough air through
that'll mean lesser overclocks or not as
good overclock as you could have so
we're still going to retain those low
noise settings when the graphics card is
idling on the desktop by holding down
left click and dragging this little box
here and so I like that at 20 degrees I
like it at 20 percent we can even go a
little bit more and say 30 degrees can
have that at 30% then we hold this left
click this down and I want my graphics
card as soon as the game's booting up I
want this thing pretty aggressive so
we've got 60% fan speeds at 40 degrees C
and with 80 degrees we can have that at
50 I mean so 80% we can have that at 50
degrees and then we hold down the left
box here and drag that up to a hundred
percent at 70 degrees now once you guys
to click OK and then it'll ask you to
restart so you press you get
and now down the bottom right corner you
can left-click the little icon here and
the MSI Afterburner because we started
at minimized we can then open it up
again and we've got all these options
here with the core voltage now being
unlocked so we can slide that all the
way to the top here but do be careful
with this setting because some graphics
cards they just can't handle
overclocking with extra voltage and
extra heat so what we've got here is an
extra hundred millivolts on the graphics
card and so for instance make r9 290x
that I recently overclocked in a video I
couldn't actually set this to the
maximum because it was getting too hot
and also I had an induced rx 470 Strix
where I had to be very careful with this
to this setting here so depending on the
graphics card you will have to be
careful with it but for a lot of
graphics cards it should be okay to just
set this slider to the maximum also just
below that you can set the power limit
and the temp limit all the way to the
maximum - and now I'm using a GTX 1060
gaming X which is a pretty low powered
graphics card in terms of power
consumption but it is a pretty powerful
card in terms of performance so
something like this setting all these
maximum sliders here if you have a GTX
1060 or a gtx 1070 or even 1080 should
be absolutely fine now we go below that
core clock this is where things start to
get a little bit trickier because we're
going to have to find these out for our
own graphics card now every graphics
card is different so I want you guys
with the core clock to just play around
with it and I'm going to try straight up
200 megahertz which is really aggressive
on a GTX 1060 so we're going to lock
that in and then we're going to open up
heaven benchmark MSI Afterburner with
the heaven benchmark left-click run and
now if it crashes we'll see that our
screen will just flicker and all sorts
of crazy behavior will happen sometimes
we'll even have to restart our computer
so don't be afraid now we can see here
it's actually crashing now I'm recording
this on a different computer so you'll
see that my webcam won't actually crash
out so don't worry about that but it's
on your main computer you'll get this
behavior
exactly what's coming up on this screen
here so let me see here this 200
megahertz on the core it was just too
aggressive so we're going to try and get
back into the desktop now sometimes
you'll have to control or delete alt tab
as it's just yet going crazy at the
moment so and this is the one thing I've
wanted to show you guys overclocking can
get pretty confusing sometimes so there
it is stopped working so we could see
that that overclock was too aggressive
so we're going to try and lower that now
by a good 50 mega tree let's try 150 now
because that was just crashing straight
away there was no chance that that
overclock was going to work so we're
going to try this next one and the
reason we're using the heav'n benchmark
because it's not the most graphically
intensive benchmark but it's so quick to
load up and it's so quick to find an
unstable overclock like this so that's
why I'm using this first and later on
you're going to see I'm going to use
another benchmark to test for 100%
ability so this is kind of doing the
same behavior as before so a hundred and
fifty megahertz on the core clock is
probably not not possible hopefully we
can quit before it we might have
definitely control-alt-delete again just
to get out of this program because it's
crashing again so we're going to close
that window off and we're going to try
and lower now the overclocks by 50
megahertz again so we're going to try
for a hundred and 107 that should be
okay we'll try that and then we'll run
it let's lock that in and we'll run this
again one more time
so overloading I grabbed art I want you
guys to see some of the frustrations
because there's going to be a lot of
different guides out there where maybe
they just like okay lock it in it should
be okay but this is where you're going
to get a lot of people going to be
overcoming they're gonna be like okay my
computer's crashing I'm just not going
to overclock I'm just going to go back
to the default settings but I want to
show you guys that crashing is
completely normal your graphics card is
not going to be broken
Woori no a lot of people think oh my god
computer crash my whole thing's broken
know all these settings in MSI
Afterburner they're completely safe you
can't really break your graphics card
with these settings unless you're grabs
card the cooler is not attached to the
graphics card properly which is a
different problem altogether so we can
see here this is actually running okay
so if it is it's not crashing this time
around so what this means is that our
core clock we exit that now because
that's pretty good I mean usually I like
to run it for a lot longer because we're
doing a tutorial we're going to sort of
fast-track it a little bit so but what
this means is that our core clock on
this graph is card is somewhere around
here this is somewhere where our
graphics card is able to run without
crashing it'll probably be a little bit
less I imagine it'd be a little bit less
maybe somewhere around there but it
could be this as well that's the thing
so we've done the core clock now we're
going to move over to the memory clock
and now I usually like to just chuck
these up at 300 megahertz at a time so
we're going to try 300 megahertz lock
that in and see if it runs and you'll
get the same behavior if your graphics
card is crashing while you're doing this
it'll be the same as the core clock the
program will crash weird behavior will
come up but sometimes with the GPU
memory overclock you'll actually have to
restart your computer too so I found on
AMD cards as well especially on AMD
cards like my r9 290x when I was
overlooking the memory I had to restart
the whole computer quite a few times so
restarting and crashing guys is
completely normal so here the 300
megahertz overclocked is running
completely normal so far like for one
minute
so which isn't really a long time to be
stable bit let's talk more once we find
sort of more speeds so we're gonna go
back into msi afterburner and chuck
another 300 megahertz on that overclock
and then we're going to left-click run
and we're going to see if this runs at
600 megahertz so this is pretty
aggressive I'm pretty surprised if this
works I'll be pretty happy because this
is a pretty aggressive overclock on the
memory we're essentially getting near
gddr5 X means I believe and this is only
GDR five memory so that's pretty cool
now even you it's actually this is
pretty good this is running absolutely
fine as well so like I said before we're
going to kind of fast track so we're
going to lock in a higher memory
overclock here we're going to try for
900 megahertz that this will not work at
all I don't think this is really
aggressive if this works I have won the
silicon lottery in terms of memory
overclocking but I just want to show you
guys that crashing and show you guys
again like the core clock the pro well
okay there we got lines through that
this even before the benchmark loaded
this wasn't working so we can see here
just flat nothing so we're going to just
our control-alt-delete and yeah we even
got a fatal error there okay so that was
not stable at all so we're going to drop
this and we are going to up the we're
going to drop it down to 750 somewhere
in between so we had 600 before and now
we've got 900 so in a try for 750 and
we're going to see if we get any
problems so memory overclocked you don't
have to be too precise here the core
clock is always more important than the
memory clock keep that in mind that's
well okay so we assertively loaded up
the benchmark we had some problems here
this you can see there the art that's
called artifacting so essentially this
memory overclock is not stable so that's
the second problem you're going to have
the first problem is crashing if you
graphically crashes like it was before
then it's way off being stable if it
starts artifacting like it just did then
which is where all these weird things
come up that shouldn't be there you can
then know that you're probably pretty
close to being stable so now we were at
750
we can try maybe 650 and see if we have
any problems with this overclock so this
is also going to be the overclock that I
will be using for my upcoming showdown
between the 1060 and the rx 580 so this
will be interesting to see how high this
graphics card goes
so you can see here it's running okay so
far so good
but I usually like to give this a good
10 to 30 minutes at least in this
benchmark before I come back for you
guys and say if it's relatively stable
or not so we're going to let this run
for a good chunk of time and then I'm
going to come back and see how it went
so now we've been running the hebben
benchmarks for a good 30 minutes and
also decided to run the inbuilt
benchmark so which gives you a score and
we see here overclocked we're scoring
over 3,800 points and not overclocked
out-of-the-box settings are getting
around 3,500 so we're gaining a good
chunk of performance near a 10% increase
in this benchmark alone
however unity in heaven is only one
benchmark and it's not the most GPU
intense benchmark so now we're going to
move over to fire strike and test that
in that benchmark if that's really GPU
intensive and then we're going to see if
this overclock passes if it doesn't then
we're going to have to drop our
overclocks by a little bit more and then
we should be stable in most games though
keep in mind that this benchmark here
the UniGene heaven I use this because as
I set up before it just loads up so
quickly and it finds crashes really
quickly so we can sort of homed in on
our levels really quickly with this
program and then use fire straight for
the finishing touches so let's get over
to that benchmark so this is fire strike
it's a free program though you will get
a demo if you haven't purchased the
license which is fine you can just
download that I'll put the link in the
description below for you guys so
download this install this and then you
can click on run now I'm expecting this
to crash because every time I've found
like a relatively stable overclock in
heaven it's actually crashed in fire
strikes so hopefully this works as we
sit here this benchmark it just takes a
long time to load up which is generally
why I don't use it to test first stable
overclocks that good 20 seconds you're
just wasting is time you've got a waste
over and over again so and I expect it
to crash like pretty much either in the
second run or even in the combined score
so we'll see here that it's getting
through the benchmark
okay but I'm just like sitting here and
waiting for it okay then there we go it
actually crashed on me right now so
we've see there that this is actually
good for you guys to see that even
though it may appear stable in some
gains in some benchmarks it's actually
not a hundred percent stable so what
we're going to do is we're going to drop
that by a good fifty megahertz on the
memory and we're going to drop the core
clock by a good twenty five megahertz so
hopefully this passes the benchmark so
let's load that up and let's stress test
this and see if it works
okay so we just completed our benchmark
there with the lower settings that we
had on there so this is pretty much
close to being stable now we want to run
this benchmark a few times play a few
games but we may have to lower this just
by a little bit more or same with the
memory clocks as well in after lower
these just by a little bit more so we
see that we can lock that in and we can
go to let's click on the Save there and
we can save that to any number of these
profiles so we left-click on 3 and then
also you can left-click on start up so
essentially every time we boot the
computer now this program will load up
minimized and it'll lock in our
overclocks automatically so now we're
getting free performance all the time
all day every day so this is really
awesome it's so awesome in fact that you
may now have to wear PC glasses while
you are playing video games
so we finished the fire strike benchmark
and we've got a graphics score of over
15,000 if we compare that to the
original score we can still we've gained
a good chunk of performance and not only
this benchmark but also the heaven
benchmark and what this means is when
you're playing video games you're going
to get more FPS and for doing absolutely
nothing this is free performance in your
graphics card waiting to be utilized and
hopefully this tutorial has helped you
guys get that extra performance out of
your graphics card and if you appreciate
