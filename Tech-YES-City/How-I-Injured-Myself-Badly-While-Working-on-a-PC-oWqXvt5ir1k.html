on the channel for quite a few days now
it's probably the longest stretch I've
gone without uploading any videos for
you guys I did post up on social media
what happened but didn't exactly explain
how it happened and that's today we're
gonna talk about this mistake and how I
guess these things happen in tech these
freak accidents so I guess we should
just get into the gory deets so right
here is my thumb and it has a total of 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 stitches in it and this
happened when I was working on an
alienware case never had any experience
with this case before and I guess that's
the problem right there is when you're
delving in new things and of course me
being used to the way things go around
the channel I'm always building pcs
hustling making videos for you guys
getting deals and I guess I'm in a rush
and in the past I've broken my toe and
that was when I was in a rush as well
and then before that the only times I've
ever I guess broken bones or hurt my
body of course injuries when I've been
in a rush for instance when I was a
teenager I rushed into the fight and got
suplexed and broke my shoulder so if
it's anything to share with you guys I
guess the first thing to come out of
today's video is don't rush anything but
anyway catching this on camera I'm gonna
blur out some of the gory stuff because
I don't think YouTube allows you to show
it but I was working on this case and
essentially it just had this little
bracket inside the GPU area for some
reason whenever I try to fit gravis
cards on cases it's usually OEM cases
whether it be a Lenovo OEM Dell or
something like that they have these
little silver lining brackets and I find
the gravis cards especially decent
gravis cards like you have a IB board
partner cards just won't fit in properly
and so I usually take these brackets out
and then they fit in smooth and flush
and so here's what the problem began
they usually come out pretty easy except
this one was sort of like stuck in there
really hard and then to top that off it
is literally the sharpest edge I've ever
seen in a PC case and so those two
things coupled together I was trying to
pull it out and I slipped and it just
then sliced through my whole finger
right down to the bone and that was
pretty crazy because I immediately
what happened and I pretty much cut off
the blood circulation and then ran
upstairs and then got myself to a doctor
ASAP they then went to town on this
thumb and then put in some anaesthetic
stitched it up and then bandaged it and
it's now been five days since that
happened and I've got a little bit of
sensation back in my thumb now it still
does hurt and I can't properly work I've
tried putting together some pcs and it's
literally a one-armed affair at the
moment and really opened my eyes to just
how I guess grateful I am to be healthy
and also come out of this with a thumb
that's still going to be usable I just
don't know how long it's gonna take for
me to actually work properly again
because when I go to use it it does
sting quite hard and I do want it to
heal properly so that's that guys it's
just one of those freak accidents that
happens if you ask me if I ever see some
of these sharps silver lining brackets
again I'm definitely gonna be using a
pair of pliers to pull them out and I'm
not going anywhere near it because oddly
enough it actually sliced into my other
finger as well and it just seems that
it's lucky that the nail on this thing
too blocked it out from actually doing
any more damage to my other thing guys
so it could have been a lot worse it's
just I don't know out of it's just
really weird out of all the stuff I've
done here on the channel where I've
opened up power suppliers and all this
other crazy stuff it's a simple thing
like a bracket inside a PC case that
ends up doing the most damage to us but
every guys there'll be some cool content
coming I will actually still do a video
with that Alienware case it'll be an
interesting video where essentially it's
one of the worst case designs I think
I've seen yet not only is it small
form-factor so it's going to have a hard
time breathing but the top that off this
sort of like enclosed the whole case for
limited airflow so I do have some before
and after temperatures we've also got a
check yes hurricane going on around here
where we're going to be sort of clearing
out the studio just of all the old used
parts and sort of starting afresh again
and yes I have been having a break the
last five days I've been watching a bit
of drummer on Netflix and kicking back
and just relaxing but in ways it kind of
sucks because I'm just used to going at
a certain pace and just keeping up the
energy I haven't gone to the gym for
five days and so it has been good to
have a little bit
brave but at the same time I haven't
done anything I haven't gone to the gym
and just sort of been on lockdown and
that kind of sucks I kind of like kind
of enjoy the used parts hustle on all
the other videos so so for the prognosis
it's now a Saturday I did this last
Sunday so it's been about six days since
I did this accident prognosis I think I
get the stitches removed in four days
but after that I still have to be very
careful to make sure I don't reinjure it
in any way shape or form so it is quite
a messy and deep cut that I sustained
here certainly don't recommend it and
lastly I will say I always be careful of
sharp edges don't take anything for
granted I think that's something I've
learned for sure I'm used to just going
at 100 miles an hour when it comes to
everything PC related and I guess this
one just slipped up on me like quite
literally anyway I hope you enjoyed
today's video if you did be sure to hit
that like button let us know in the
comment section below what's the worst
I guess injury you've sustained while
building pcs or even if you've sustained
an injury in doing something else sort
of like some freak accident let us know
in the comment section below I love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon he's out for now
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
