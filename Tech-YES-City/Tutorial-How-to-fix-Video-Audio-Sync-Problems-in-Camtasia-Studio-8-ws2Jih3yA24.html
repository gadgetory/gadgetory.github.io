as you coming back to you guys today
with a tutorial on Camtasia Studio 8 and
now if you guys didn't know Camtasia
Studio 8 is basically a desktop
recording software but it also allows
you to use your webcam at the same time
which is very useful I use this program
pretty much does a lot of my videos for
currently for YouTube it is an amazing
program however I was having video audio
sync issues and since about 2 months ago
and lately I've actually been asked
quite a few times how to how how can I
fix audio/video sync problems in
Camtasia Studio 8 so today I'm going to
give you guys some tips that basically
fixed my problems and any problems I was
having in Camtasia Studio 8 and
basically guys overall I think part 2 is
the most important part part 1 I'm just
going to show you since my webcams on I
can actually show you part 1 and that's
going to be make sure your hard drives
are optimized ok for Camtasia Studio 8
so I want you to go to start menu and if
we go to control panel so click start
menu click control panel and now if your
view is different to mine so it look
doesn't look like mine I want you to
click up view by and small icons that'll
be easier to see everything and then I
want you to click on device manager so
this one here click on that and right
here disk drives ok so we go down to
disk drives first things first
whatever hard drive you are using to
record on I want you to right click on
that hard drive and click properties so
for me it's my Western Digital blacks I
actually use two of them in raid 0 so
basically that means two of them are
working together and basically I want
you to go here and check make sure both
these boxes are checked ok so I'll do
that again for you right click on the
hard drive click properties go to
policies tab up the top and make sure
both these boxes are checked ok enable
right casing on the device and turn off
Windows right casing buffer flashing on
the device make sure both these are
checked for the hard drives you are
using and that is the first step now the
second step here is to go to IDE ATA
atopy controllers and make sure that
this is up to date or more pacifically
it's the driver that is prescribed by
your motherboard manufacturer ok so for
me I have an AZ rock z77 motherboard
and now we want you to right-click
properties go to driver and now for mine
as you can see here it's 2012 it's the
most recent driver released ok from
Intel
so it's Intel 7 Series C 261 chipset
family sada h-hey CI controller now
basically this is the latest driver if I
didn't have this drive it would be like
a 2009 Windows driver or something like
that so if you have a 2009 driver on
there you may wish to you know just
update your driver have a check if you
can't find your the driver there you can
go on to google and search your
motherboard and chipset driver and
update it through that way this will
basically optimize it'll optimize the
controller for your hard disk so you'll
be getting the best speeds possible when
you're recording and that may help
things okay so that's part one of the
tutorial let's move on to part two and
I'll actually have to turn off my webcam
for this part okay guys we're coming
back now with part two of the tutorial
and this is the most important part okay
so I actually found the problem the
problem for me was the web camera itself
okay it wasn't camtasia studio it's
fault my web camera is AC 270 and
basically i'm going to show you now guys
so i want you to open up skype okay so
since i can't get there via my camtasia
menu because i'm currently recording
with it i'm going to show you another
way okay so if basically go to skype you
can go to tools options and it'll bring
up the menu here and i want you to go
down to video settings now I can see
myself hey woo now once you go to web
camera settings okay so it'll show you
like it will bring up your webcam you go
to web camera settings and now what I
found was it was actually two problems
that was occurring okay so basically the
first problem was the auto settings okay
so I want you to take off all these
check uncheck all these boxes here okay
uncheck right light uncheck auto auto
you can leave on anti flicker as it's a
constant thing okay so anything constant
is okay basically what happens with the
web camera control is these auto
settings they'll change and then they'll
sent they allow interrupt because
Camtasia basically captures the device
it holds on to your microphone it holds
on to your webcam and you can't if any
interacts with that it'll cause problems
and that's what exactly is happening I
believe for a lot of people it was
happening for me once I turned off these
auto settings I never had these big
video sync problems again however I will
go on to part two now I mean sorry I
will go on to step two and that is so
after you've done this and saved it and
basically after I did that I never had
my first video always recorded was
basically giving me or wait just
continually be fine the second video or
the third video would have these micro
stutters and now basically guys if
you're getting micro stutters all that
simply is as your webcam is overheating
okay yes that's right your webcam is
overheating so I don't know if you guys
have ever talked on skype before and
you've seen your webcam sort of flicker
that's just simply your webcam
overheating and getting it needs to cool
down and basically yeah if you want to
get really good videos you have to
obviously buy an expensive web camera I
will be buying a new one soon as this is
like a twenty dollar webcam even though
the quality is very good for the money
this is a very good webcam for the money
however it's not the best obviously
they're going to use cheap hardware in a
twenty dollar mic cam so basically yeah
it's either turn off these auto settings
and then after that I want you guys to
and if you're still having the problem
say the first video is fine the first
ten minute video is absolutely fine the
second and the third video start to have
these little micro stutters basically
that's just your webcam overheating and
so the only way to fix that is to buy a
good web camera okay and so guys I hope
this has helped you if you're having
frustrating video audio sync problems
and if you haven't guys please give this
video a like and subscribe to help me
out and if you have any questions about
camtasia studio 8 please leave comment
in the comment section below or send me
a personal message if it's urgent and
i'll get back to you as soon as I can
I hope this has helped you guys out and
yes Camtasia Studio is a fantastic
program is amazing ok and basically
that's the problems I were having I was
having so I'm having absolutely no more
problems with Camtasia Studio right now
I've figured out all my problems and the
program is working absolutely fine for
me it's an amazing program so I hope you
guys yeah you know this is very little
tedious problem but it's basically the
web cameras fault
so anyway peace out for now brain easy
