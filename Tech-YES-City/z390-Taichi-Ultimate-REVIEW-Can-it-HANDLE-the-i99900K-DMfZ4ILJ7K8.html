details are still out there in the wild
so we'll have to wait on those but in
particular in this review I can't talk
about any of those CPU details as just
yet but I can't say one thing and that
is I did test out a particular CPU that
puts out a lot of heat to stress this
vrm for this review and so what we've
got here is the Z 390 Taiji ultimate
from asrock which is essentially a step
up from the Z 370 I 7 professional
gaming series even though it features a
similar set they've gone with the Taichi
ultimate to implement that 10 gigabit
NIC for example as well as adding two
additional USB ports on the back and
then beefing things up on the
motherboard for instance they're giving
you eight PWM fan controller outs as
well as an additional four pin power
feed for the CPU but on that note of V
RMS and everything else with this
motherboard let's go in-depth and take a
look for you guys
welcome back to check your city and here
we have the Z 390 Tai Chi ultimate which
is as Rox flagship board for this
chipset in particular previously it was
the professionals I said in the intro Z
370 gaming i7 professional motherboard
they are pretty similar in terms of
their 12 phase vrm designs featured 12 K
capacitors from niche econ 60 amp chokes
as well as Texas Instruments next FETs
these effects that are true and tried in
the industry and they did a phenomenal
job of keeping a particular CPU under
wraps when it came to overclocking when
it wasn't overclocked we're looking at
about 79 degrees on that motherboard and
then 44 degrees on the heatsink the
heatsink they are using weighs in at
about 250 grams but I will say one thing
with this vrm it did handle the
particular CPU absolutely fine nothing
to worry about even with no vrm cooling
but in terms of efficiency the Maximus
hero 6 did do an ever so slight edge in
getting better efficiency numbers so
maybe as ROC will want to think about in
the next and lamentations of their
motherboards moving over to vishay
silicon X MOSFETs moving over to memory
over clocks this is 32 hundred megahertz
XMP profiles matched overclocked and
manually to 3,700 megahertz same as the
Maximus hero so the memory over clocks
at least in my experience with this
motherboard aren't going to be limited
by the motherboard itself more so your
memory
moving down the motherboard we've got
three nvme solutions here the bottom one
featuring a heat sink and this heatsink
does work and it works pretty well
dropping temperatures over 20 degrees so
when we had the heatsink we saw 72
degrees in the software itself doing a
100 gigabyte file transfer 58 degrees on
the heatsink then with the heatsink off
94 degrees on the PCB and then 97
degrees with it off keep in mind I am
doing my readings at particular points
in the test and that I'm comparing it
apples to apples in that same particular
test
so another motherboard reviews you may
see the results differ a little bit but
maybe through PCI solutions they've got
steel-reinforced slots on the 16x slots
even though one of them is only a true
16x slot the one below that is 8 X and
then the one below that 4x so if you are
getting to RTX 28 ET is then you may
wish to step it up to the X 299 or go
with AMD solutions for their
motherboards because you will be limited
a X Lots when it comes to putting those
motherboards in NV link which I haven't
tested yet but it may be cause for
concern since the 8-speed slot may just
limit the RT X 28 ETA I haven't tested
it yet so I can't confirm the movie
through other features we've got power
and reset buttons as well as a dr. debug
LED readout your front USB type-c out as
well as front USB three out and eight
SATA ports onboard so a lot of
connectivity as well as as we mentioned
before apt om fan controllers that can
be controlled via a software there's
also RGB lighting at the top-left
heatsink and also the bottom right
Taichi ultimate heat sink that can be
controlled via the polychrome RGB sync
software as well as having an additional
four pin and three pin outs for
connecting different devices and
controlling it via the motherboard
itself and now looking at as rocks on
board audio solution they called the
purity sound for it is phenomenal for an
onboard audio solution below seven Hertz
we saw a drop off there just like the
upcoming a Zeus review you see that the
onboard audio solutions are phenomenal
and we saw like literally maximum was
like a two decibel drop-off below seven
Hertz after that we saw the frequency
response curve being pretty much
perfectly flat the whole way through
those frequencies that your ears will
definitely need for a nice natural sound
under 80 decibels of crosstalk however
after a volume level of 90 there is a
little bit of audio leaking over from
the left channel to the right channel so
if you are using the realtek 1220
onboard audio solution for headphones or
speakers via analog output then in my
opinion you will want to keep that
volume level at 90 or below the balance
of the left and right channels compared
to each other was within point one
decibel spec which is phenomenal again
and looking at the onboard mic in or the
ADC we've got here 192 kilohertz 24-bit
as well as on that note the audio out
supports up to 192 kilohertz 32 bit
depth so you've got a lot of play room
there though with the mic in itself
we've got a hundred level + 30 DB and
there is noise suppression this is
visible when we were doing a focus
recording just from the mic in line
itself find no microphone you can see
that it's perfectly flat though when you
do change sometimes you can identify a
little boost while it's changing the
decibel levels that's essentially
noise suppression kicking in heavier the
more you raise the volume so for
professional recordings with this
onboard audio you'd only want to use the
line in but the mic in will be fine for
talking to your mates playing games and
keeping things noise free also one
notable thing with the audio out is the
volume levels have been raised
especially when I compared to that of
the Z 370 also covering some last-minute
things with this motherboard you've got
dual band AC Wireless with an included
antenna which is an external device me
personally I do prefer the antennas I
think they're more mobile and less
clutter on your desk but of course the
module is seems to be a way where the
higher end flagship boards are going and
look at the back of the board I must say
you've got a lot of different
connectivity here 8 USB ports one of
those are 3.1 one of those a type C as
well as six of those being 3.0
DisplayPort and HDMI outs as well as two
one gigabit per second NICs one of those
being a 2-1 9 V and the other being a
2-1 180 and then you've got an equator
10 gigabit NIC which in speed tests did
a phenomenal job and also on that note
testing the USB 3 speeds they showed no
slowdowns whatsoever you've also got a
clear CMOS button and a manual 5.1
analog out for your surround sound or an
optical out and I love those optical
outs especially if you're using
something like the Z 906 surround sound
which I'm using and I absolutely love it
and I do rely on those optical outs so
please never get rid of them and
touching on the UEFI bias you've got a
simple in advanced mode of course I'm so
used to advanced mode going through the
features here has everything I'd want
especially for air and water
overclockers nothing has really changed
up here compared to previous generations
of azeroth motherboards at least the
civically the z 370 or the Z 200 series
it has all the features I'm looking for
when it comes to overclocking CPU
control as well as voltage case ratios
ddr4 Ram speeds as well as having
presets there too but one thing I will
point out is maybe it could use an
aesthetic boost
I think the competitors are starting to
update their biases I would like to see
a little bit of a fresh update but one
thing I didn't find the polychrome RGB
software control in this particular boss
but keep in mind this is a pre-release
sample though there is the option to
automatically update it if you've got an
internet connection coming in via your
router you can also save overclocking
profiles individually and control each
of the PWM fan headers automatically or
manually
and now we're a conclusion time with the
XIII night Itachi ultimate and as always
as rock do a phenomenal job I guess of
bringing value into flagship this does
come in cheaper than the competitors
options or at least with the ultimate
since you're getting the 10 gigabit Nick
it comes in around the same as the
competitors solutions which are their
flagship motherboards if you take away
the ultimate and just get the Tai Chi
and you do save quite a bit of money and
it is my recommendation to go with the
normal Z 390 tai chi that should be
released with the same specs - one of
those 10 gigabit NICs
and so I've recommended this in the past
just grab yourself a tanking a bit Nick
if you need it and then port that over
to build a build since you do get that
for speed PC a slot down the bottom
which let's face it no one's going to be
going with 3-way SLI in 2018 or 2019
unless you're going for crazy
overclocked battles but even then
they're only using two cards but
currently the Z 370 Taichi and asteroid
comes in around 280 Ozzy in America it's
a lot cheaper as well so if coming into
the great price point the ultimate as I
said before does add around about 70 to
100 Ozzy dollars I don't have official
pricing just yet I will update the
description below
but basically for a flagship board it
definitely ticks all the boxes I'd want
and you would want to go with the Taichi
ultimate if you see yourself using this
for say the next five years and you do
utilize ten gigabits per second
solutions for the NIC itself so you do
have that on board you won't have to
worry about getting any adding cards so
that is the option as rocker offering
and it is a solid board through and
through from anything from the vrm to
the overclocking to the blast features
and to the onboard audio but more
importantly it can handle CPUs that do
put out a lot of heat with overclocks
that are very high I have confirmed with
a colleague of mine who lives up in
Brisbane about these overclocking Xand
this board civically and he was able to
get much better numbers than I was
through high-end custom overclocking
water cooling and he said that the VRM
on this particular board as well handled
the particular CPU that puts out a lot
of heat absolutely fine anyway guys hope
you enjoyed this review stay tuned I
will have the Maximus hero 6 coming out
as well hope you enjoyed this one if you
did then be sure to hit that like button
let me know in the comment section below
what you think about z3 90 and more
typically the Z 390 Tai Chi ultimate
love reading your thoughts and opinions
as always and I'll catch you on the next
tag video very soon peace out for now
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
