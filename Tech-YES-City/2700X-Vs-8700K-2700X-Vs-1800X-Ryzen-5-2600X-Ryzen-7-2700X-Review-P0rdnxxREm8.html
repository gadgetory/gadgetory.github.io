risin 7 mm series six and eight core
CPUs today we have a lot of benchmarks
to get through but of course answering
those most important questions first has
the IPC improved and also what about the
latency and x4 70's versus x3 70
motherboards first off with the IPC I
did notice an improvement testing on
Cinebench and also Far Cry primal going
with the 4 gigahertz 1,800 X comparing
it against the 2700 Expo the 4 gigahertz
both with the same memory speeds as well
with the same sticks of memory saw an
increase from 164 to 168
so those IPC claims are indeed true and
also moving over to Far Cry primal there
was a little bump in FPS as well so they
have improved IPC they have gone from 14
nanometer to 12 nanometer as well change
the lithography up and that has enabled
the CPUs in my opinion to clock on
average about 200 mega it's higher and
doing so with a little bit less voltage
however in Thailand I also managed to
test out a lot of these CPUs and found
that they hit brick walls at about four
point two five gigahertz after that you
had to give them a considerable amount
of voltage especially on air and water
to get the clocks higher even though I
did manage to get one of the CPUs to 4.3
gigahertz in Thailand here at the studio
the Mac's overclock was 4.25 gigahertz
however I did drop it down to 4.2
because of the diminishing returns
anyway with that aside is an X 470
motherboard going to make a difference
to performance not in my tests an X 370
and even a be 350 motherboard showed the
same memory clocks at least with the XMP
profiles and the SOC voltage with the
same CPU the 1600 X and the 2700 X
across both motherboards so no you don't
have to go out and buy a new motherboard
you can update your BIOS however do keep
in mind with some of the x4 70
motherboards they may have improved vrm
designs which may help with overclocks
especially at the higher end and now
moving on with the improvements on the
Zen tuas architecture AMD promised me at
the event that there were latency
reductions across the board level 1
level 2 level 3 cache and also the ddr4
memory latencies and when I put the CPUs
through their paces I did indeed notice
a massive reduction in the level 2
latency in particular level 1 didn't
change so much
three there was an improvement as well
and of course the ddr4 memory to the IMC
was improved too so that was great to
see however another thing that I did
notice was that since these chips do in
my opinion have a better integrated
memory controller at least compared to
my 1800 X that was a last year's initial
launch sample I noticed that I was able
to squeeze an extra two hundred and
sixty-six mega Hertz on the memory so I
went from thirty-two hundred with my
ddr4 g.skill kit to 34 66 so basically
AMD made promises and they delivered on
them and they were very transparent
about them that is a really good thing
that's getting a lot of respect from me
but the biggest thing of course as I
said before those Layton sees this is
why I'm gonna be recommending the rise
in CPUs here today in my opinion as soon
as I jumped on the 2700 X I just noticed
it was snappy and that's one thing I've
complained about in the past about the
1800 X I thought it wasn't as snappy as
the 8700 K but this here is a true
improvement and it's one that I can
recommend to enthusiasts not just for
gaming but also productivity because of
those latency reductions I don't know
for some reasons I notice it it's one of
those things this CPU architecture feels
snappy for that aside let's get on with
the other pathar of benchmarks that we
have to get through for you guys
welcome back to take us sitting before
we get on with those gaming and
productivity benchmarks I will say the
overclocks in these CPUs are enthusiast
levels what I call the sweet spot levels
I believe overclockers and enthusiasts
should be having their CPUs at these
levels or somewhere around these levels
so for the 2700 X 4 point 2 gigahertz
for the 2600 X 4 point 2 gigahertz for
the 1800 X 4 gigahertz and for the 8700
K 5 gigahertz now the cooler way using H
110 igt from Corsair and we're also
using a GTX 1080 GI from gal ax and
they're all at the same speeds and the
ambient temperatures were all at 25
degrees
during testing now I did validate these
results on the X 470 Oris and also the
Taichi board so validated on both the
motherboards just to weed out any
variance and lastly of course for the
memory we're using 2 8 gigabyte sticks
from g.skill this is 16 16 16 39 timings
for very tight timings at 3400 megahertz
now I did get these speeds up to 34 66
on the 8700 K 2700 X and 2600 X and on
the 1800 X I got up to 3.2 gigahertz to
do that imc limitations with that aside
let's roll those benchmarks
and as always the benchmarks paint the
biggest picture of all when it came to
productivity we saw the 2700 X and the
2600 X we're absolutely flooring it and
also in terms of value for money 329
bucks and this thing's posting up some
incredible Cinebench scores some great
post rendering times in Adobe Premiere
Pro and also included the new benchmark
v-ray which showed that the 2700 X is
indeed winning them out of the pack here
and so it is coming into the lower price
point than the 8700 K so if productivity
and saving time is something that you
need then the 2,700 X will provide that
especially like where the CPU is coming
out in my previous video I was already
knew I was going to like this thing
because the included Wraith prism cooler
looks really nice too it's an RGB cooler
managed to get the CPU up to four point
zero five gigahertz the 2600 X that's
coming in at $229 comes with a raised
spire that can get it up to 3.8
gigahertz now the Wraith stealth I did
manage to test this because this is the
cooler coming in with the horizon 520
609 X and I could only get this up to
3.4 gigahertz so I was a little bit
surprised to see that spire disappear on
the non x6 core variant that is sort of
like a little bit of a loss in chunk of
value so the risin 5 2600 those still at
$199 you just want to go buy yourself a
good cooler and get that thing up to 4
gigahertz + which can easily be done for
an extra $30 and of course you can still
couple of with the B 350 and notice no
detriment to performance so I'm really
liking with his new CPUs are coming into
the price point and it seems like AMD's
close the gap this time around to make
the 8 core more appealing in value for
money of course moving on with those
gaming benchmarks it was great to see an
improvement to the AMD CPUs this time
around last year they did get criticized
for having lackluster gaming performance
this year there's an improvement
there and of course I got to see
firsthand how much really good memory
makes a difference for this architecture
of course it will give a boost to the
Intel CPUs as well that's not to be
taken away from but another thing as
well as the 8700 K will still be the
king for gaming there's no denying that
my results here show that in some games
as well especially if they're
single-threaded IPC dependent games the
8700 K 5 gigahertz are still going to
floor it when it comes to gaming and if
you're a competitive gamer and you need
the best FPS possible that's still going
to be the choice for competitive gamers
but whether rising comes into a play is
that it's soldered from the die to the
IHS you get a really good cooler
especially the $329 2700 X and the
productivity benchmarks beat that of the
8700 K so if you want something that's
more balanced that's going to save you
time when it comes to working and can
still get up and play games really well
then the 2700 X is going to be my
recommendation 2600 X is still going to
be a good buy but since ddr4 Ram prices
are still expensive I would be
personally going for the 2700 X if I
have to choose and of course the 2700
it's clocked lower and it comes with the
spire RGB LED cooler which is inferior
to the prism and the prism looks really
good and even if you're not going to use
it on a build you can definitely sell
that thing for more than $30 that I'm
sure of you guys when it comes down to
it I know they'll probably be some
people out there who are disappointed
this only gets another 200 megahertz
over the 1,800 X on average and it only
has a 3% IPC improvement but for me I've
been harping on about the latency and
the snappiness
in the last year and that to me is the
biggest improvement of the 2700 X I feel
like AMD have absolutely nailed it in
making this CPU not only a Productivity
King and especially for the money but
also making it a snappy really low
latency fast driven CPU one that I can
certainly recommend and one that I'll
definitely be putting in my main rig and
making yet another switch but before I
do that I'll be doing some very deep
testing for you guys we'll be testing
some things don't worry about that and
also before I get on out here as well
the expo
70 motherboards do come with a sense in
my technology I wasn't provided the
driver to install that just yet so I
will be testing that when AMD are ready
to launch that but you do get the
license included with x4 70 motherboards
there are no B 450 motherboards yet I'm
not sure if AMD plans to release them
but I'm pretty sure they will later on
down the track but of course you can get
a be 350 motherboards we're very cheap
update the BIOS and get yourself a
really good value for money that's still
a good option available and I like that
AMD leaving that option open to
enthusiasts who want the best bang for
your buck and of course in those gaming
benchmarks we did see the 2600 X pool
ever so slightly ahead of the 2700 X and
as I said before it's probably due to it
having an allocation of more level 3
cache and also if you enjoyed this video
then be sure to hit that like button let
me know in the comments section below if
you have any questions or what you think
of the rise in 2000 series the new 12
nanometers n + chips Lovering your
thoughts and opinions as always and look
forward to a lot more comparisons
hitting the channel but to quickly recap
329 bucks a cause 16 threads with the
rays prism cooler it's hitting very hard
especially since they've soldered the
died of the IHS and also the 2600 X as
well that's hitting hard the way do
prefer the 2700 X and also the 8700 K
that's not going anywhere that's still
the king of IPC and single thread
performance coupled with this six cores
and twelve threads but of course
competition is here and it's happy days
and I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon
peace out for now bye
we're all improved and now putting this
Vinton so MDI welcome back to check es
city here we have the Gaines welcome
back to take your city and we're going
to get into the productivity and gaming
benchmarks but we did so as always the
benchmarks do a big painting of that
picture and what we've got here and as
always the benchmarks do all the
painting when it comes to finalizing
that picture for you guys um anyway
there it is AMD delivering so what can I
say</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
