Coolermaster booth and here we have
probably one of my favorite cases I've
seen either at least in the new design
concept this is the SL 600 M s L stands
for silent and the M stands for maker
now what's different about this case is
a few things will get that out of the
way
punched aluminum so it's really soft
aluminum they press it with so many
individual pieces of punching that it
gives this really different feel I
absolutely love it and dare I say I
prefer it over brushed aluminum or
aluminium for the guys in Aussie don't
worry I don't forget about you guys and
now here's where things get pretty
interesting with this case going inside
you've got two 20 centimeter fans
blowing that air up like a hurricane all
up through the case and at the top which
you can take the top off if you wish to
as well and then inside the case there's
an included bracket for the graphics
card you can mount that vertically or
horizontally whichever way you want to
do that you can do it of course mounting
it vertically does help with the air
flow and does give you lower
temperatures on the GPU or so I'm told
by Coolermaster another really cool
thing about the SL 600 M as you probably
saw it just light up it's actually
sensor based too so if you wipe your
hand over the USB ports these four
lights will light up so great if you're
watching movies in the dark but you
still need input and output you can
easily use that of course when it's not
in use the lights themselves will just
switch off and it'll be completely pitch
dark and now for the drive options we've
got the ability to mount four hard
drives 3.5 inch drives inside also 2
SSDs at the back and one SSD inside so a
total of seven drives external with this
case and that's coming in at 220 dollars
they're looking to release it in October
and I'm really looking forward to this
the SL 600 M but let's take a look at
what other products they got here
the year is 2018 and there's an event
called Computex in Taiwan Taipei and
this was brought to you by gigabyte and
cause Sam welcome back to take us City
right here we've got a new cosmos coming
out see 700 m you can open and close the
doors they swivel they got magnets on
them and it's tempered glass here and
business on the back with steel on the
front you can take it off oh so you got
the mesh front as well now our fully
open mesh if you wish to have that
addressable RGB which can be software
control because it does include a
software controller front top and on the
bottom of the case magnetic dust filters
throughout and you can also take the top
off as well for a different look and to
easily clean the top now going inside
this is where things get pretty crazy
with this case we've got here a swivel
mount for the graphics card which comes
included with the case so you can change
the look up and put your graphics card
in a different position than you're used
to up the top you can mount the
motherboard facing north or south so you
can have the input and output in two
different configurations so it's not
your standard configuration they're
definitely going with a different look
with this cosmos see 700 enclosed power
supply shroud and then for drive support
we've got 5 3.5 inch drives and also on
top of that and additional 4 SSDs so
they're bringing full options here in
such a large case which is coming in at
400 USD and early September so stay
tuned for that and let's move on now to
a very different power supply and this
is a really cool concept the XG 750 I
haven't seen anything like it it's still
in the really early concept development
stages they are looking to release it in
quarter 4 however and they don't even
have pricing yet but what we've got here
is a side panel on this bounce ply
itself it'll tell you temperatures it'll
tell you fan speeds automatically
without you doing anything and then it's
also able to connect up to your PC via
software and addressable RGB to on the
actual power supply so if you really
want to customize and go the extra mile
you can with this as well as being gold
rated and they are using Delta as the
OEM and Delta make phenomenal power wise
at least in the server industry - so you
know you're bringing over that
quality to a consumer-grade products and
that about wraps it up for the
coolermaster on cases and power supplies
stay tuned for another video where we're
going to be looking at a thermo electric
cooler that comes in at about three
hundred dollars but the best thing is
especially like having a refrigerator on
a cooler in a compact size that is
really cool stay tuned for that video
and if you enjoyed this one then be sure
to hit that like button and let us know
in the comment section below if you want
to find out anything more about these
two cases that we've featured here today
we're also this really cool power supply
and I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye
but you can change things up and then
and then at the rear of the case you've
got the option to at the front here
completely enclosing you're like what's
going on with air flow people are like
oh my god airflow airflow air flow now
going inside the case the orientation of
the drives themselves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
