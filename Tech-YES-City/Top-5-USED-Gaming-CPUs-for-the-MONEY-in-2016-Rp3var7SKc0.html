busy arguing which is better value for
money between the x-48 60k and the G
32:58 Pentium I'm here to present to you
guys some CPUs that'll beat both those
little bad boys in price and performance
ladies gentlemen welcome back to check
yes City this is my used CPU guide for
2016 where I'm going to give you guys
the recommendations on some of the best
value for money CPUs that are out there
for both gaming and workstation purposes
so without further ado let's get on with
the list 5 coming in at number 5 is the
i3 550 you can currently get the CPU for
around about $10 on eBay it's an
absolute beast for that price it comes
clocked in at 3.2 gigahertz it also has
4 threads and it supports the LGA 1156
motherboard socket so a lot of these
boards can be had for very cheap the non
overclockable ones even if you get them
that's pretty good since the 3.2
gigahertz clock speed is good enough for
most titles at 1080p for coming in at
number 4 is the X 54 50 which is
actually an LGA 771 CPU now you can get
this CPU for around about 20 dollars
though if you get it you will have to
get a little pad which costs an extra
dollar off eBay and then you will have
to cut some things on your motherboard
though with that said it is a fantastic
value for money CPU and it is
overclockable and it does have 4 true
cores on there 3 coming in at number 3
is the X 50 650 now this was making
rounds on the internet for being an
extremely good value for money CPU and
it still is it's a 6 core 12 threaded 32
nanometer beast which can be had for
around about $85 now the caveat to this
CPU is that the motherboards that
support it are generally pretty
expensive though if you do manage to
pick up a bargain on an x58 motherboard
and you do manage to get the CPU then
you can overclock it to around 4
gigahertz and you can get both great
performance in workstation purposes and
gaming as well - coming in at number 2
is my personal favorite this is the e 50
640 Zeon 32 nanometer 4 core 8 threaded
CPU now the good thing about this
it's only $15 and it actually doesn't
have an i7 variant though it will work
on consumer x58 motherboards and the
same caveat as the ex 5650 is that it
will need an expensive generally quite
expensive motherboard though that being
said one benefit of this CPU is that it
does have two less cos 4 or less threads
and it's easier to overclock on that x58
board as opposed to the ex 5650 which
generally needs a top-of-the-line board
to get really high overclocks 1 now
topping the list today is the e 20 670
this is the xeon sandy bridge chip the
turbos up to three point three gigahertz
now the CPU comes in at $70 at the
moment that's what you can get these for
and it has eight cores 16 threads
that's right $70 for eight cause 16
threads you just cannot beat the price
performance this thing brings to the
table now one thing about this CPU is
that it will need an expensive or
generally an expensive x78 motherboard
to work though me personally I've
ordered two of these things and I've
also ordered an asrock server board
which I'm going to be doing a project
for you guys in the near future though
it's $70 this thing easily tops out just
be sure that you get the retail samples
of these and not the engineering samples
as the engineering samples will only be
able to top out at 2.6 gigahertz which
if you generally want to be gaming and
doing workstation kind of things you
will want that extra CPU single-threaded
speed to go up to three point three
gigahertz which the retail samples do
anyway that's it for me today guys if
you have any questions or comments about
these CPUs then be sure to drop a
comment in the comment section below and
be sure to plug that thumbs up button
and I'll be coming back to you guys with
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
