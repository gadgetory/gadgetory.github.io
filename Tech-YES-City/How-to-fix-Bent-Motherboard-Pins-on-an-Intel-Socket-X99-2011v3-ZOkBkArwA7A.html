your computer freezes whoa
you know something's seriously wrong
when your computer starts freezing in
the files right so if you're one of
these people like me who had been
motherboard pin this video might be for
you
welcome back to tech L city ladies and
gentlemen is Brian coming back to you
guys today with a video on bent and
broken motherboard pins and what you
should do if you ever come into this
problem or this situation and now this
video is going to differ a little bit
too bent and broken CPU pins if you guys
didn't know AMD they use pins or they
put the pins on the CPU as opposed to
Intel generally with their motherboards
they have the pins on the socket or the
motherboard and so this means the big
difference here is that if there's a
broken pin on the motherboard you
generally can't fix it you're out of
luck just hope and pray if you do have a
broken pin on the motherboard just hope
and pray that it is in a crucial pin and
it's needed in order to work however the
CPU on the AMD side if there's a broken
pen if you guys haven't watched Linus's
video you can actually he actually
managed to put get the pin the broken
pin put it in the socket and then put
the CPU in there and it still worked so
that's the big difference though for
what it's worth I came into my x99
motherboard here in the background and
when I first got it it was man Nelson
serious problems going on so what
basically I was in the BIOS and things
were crashing in the BIOS and generally
if things start crashing in the BIOS you
know you've got a hardware problem
basically so what I did in this case was
the fact that it just freezes completely
and it did this in Windows as well when
you get complete frasier of your
computer then what you want to do is you
want to look at it and it's most likely
going to be the CPU because it can't
even process a blue screen of death and
so in this case I took everything out I
looked at the I mean I tried to all the
other to stand troubleshooting things
before I did it but I then took out the
motherboard looked closely at the socket
and I noticed there was two broken pins
and one bent pin and so I had to proceed
to bend that per hour the bent pin back
so before we get onto this though I will
say one thing and that is only do this
as a last-ditch attempt for me this is a
review sample I had nothing to lose so I
did try to do this first however if I
bought this as a brand new product I
would have shipped it back for a
replacement straight away so again only
do this as a last-ditch attempt you've
tried everything else and you'll notice
you've got some bent CPU pins you can't
replace it then you might want to give
this a shot but for it's worth I managed
to
have AUD for x99 motherboard here
already and so what I did was I put
these motherboards side by side and then
I could get a good real close look with
macrophotography
at the CPU pin layout and that gave me a
guide and I could see the two of the
pins were broken though they were
touching the other pins so I managed to
get these broken pins sort of out of the
way and then it took me about 15 minutes
but I slowly used this little pin here
it's just the wall pin with a little
nice grip there and I really took my
time to bend the pin that was in the
bottom region of the motherboard socket
back to its original position and
thankfully the two broken pins weren't
crucial I'm guessing they were in the
power delivery region of the motherboard
socket the bottom pin bent back to
normal and everything works perfectly
fine before I did the review I managed
to get this motherboard so I managed to
give it a good run make sure that this
problem wasn't affecting anything
anymore and so thank God it was working
really well
so in conclusion all I can say is if
you're going to try this seriously do it
as a last-ditch attempt and you've tried
everything else and then also while
you're doing it really be careful really
take your time for me as I said before I
took about 15 minutes to do this and I
bent the pin at the bottom pin back in
and I managed to get those other two
pins out of the way for me I was lucky
to have this other motherboard here
where I could use it as a reference
photograph however you guys if you don't
have another motherboy you may wish to
get a picture off google of the socket
and then just line it up and compare it
and so put all the pins back to normal
if you can so yeah that's about it guys
if you have any questions about bent or
broken motherboard pins and please leave
a comment : section below if you like
this video please give it a thumbs up
and I'll come back to you guys very soon
with another tech video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
