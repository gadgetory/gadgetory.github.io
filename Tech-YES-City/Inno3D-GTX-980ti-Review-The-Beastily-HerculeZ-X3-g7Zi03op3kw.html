finally time to give you guys a review
of this beastly gtx 980ti which is just
insanely beastly beast
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
tech yes it is Brian coming back to you
guys today with a long awaited review of
this in o3d 980ti now I've actually
never tried a card from you know 3d
before and a lot of you guys as well
when I posted the picture up on Twitter
you guys were like yeah I've never tried
a card so I can't wait for the review so
today I'm gonna be going over what the
card features gonna be running it
through some benchmarks doing some temps
tests and also testing out of the box
settings versus overclock settings which
especially is where this card shines so
anyway let's take a look at the card so
looking at the connectivity of the card
you get one joule DVI port there you
also get three display ports and you
also get one HDMI 2.0 there so you've
got some good connectivity there and
then you look over at the front of the
card you have this gunmetal gray black
sort of matte theme going on here even
though the black bits are kind of
semi-gloss and then it has three custom
fans here which have a no 3d stickers on
them also another good thing about these
fans are is that they are very quiet on
idle and we'll get onto a noise test
after the benchmarks and you'll be able
to hear just how loud it gets but at
idle they're very quiet though when they
speed up man can these things push some
air it's incredible like I'm sitting a
meter away from my computer and I can
feel the air from these fans so they put
some really good fans on them even
though they do get a little bit noisy
when you put on up to like a hundred
percent which I've never seen a gravis
card have fans that go up to a hundred
percent also a nice little touch on the
front of the card is the fact that
they've gone with this mechanical look
and then they're further added to that
by putting on some allen key bolts here
and eight of them in total which in my
opinion does give it this nice tough
look it's a real manly man beastly beast
look and I'm kind of impressed by it now
looking over the rear of the card you
get this semi-gloss backplate which is
made of metal and honestly it does add
to the feel of the car does make it feel
solid and way more rigid now another
good thing about it is that it does
actually do or has some input on cooling
because when I felt this card during
gaming it was getting pretty hot so I
imagine if he put a fan on it it might
be able to help with cooling somewhat
though it does have the Hercules II
design logo there and it does keep
things simple which
do appreciate a simple clean look
looking over the back of the card there
you can see it's got four heat pipes
there which run through the whole card
so continuing on to the side here you
have an eight plus six pin design here
which is the standard reference design
besides that you've got a heat sink
there covering the memory banks and the
vrm and you've got an eight phase-- vrm
on this card which is also the standard
reference design and for what it's worth
on an air-cooled overclock it does a
fine job of delivering power it also
exhibits no coil wound or this card in
particular doesn't so let's get on to
the pod that you've all been dying for
and that's the benchmarks now I had to
actually tune my CPU down because I've
only got a 630 white gold power supply
and when I had the CPU overclocked and
the graphs got overclocked I was hitting
like 880 Watts from the wall yeah that's
crazy right so anyway with that being
said I did manage to tune the CPU down a
little bit which didn't affect the
benchmarks I already confirmed it and I
managed to get the graphics card as high
as it can go so I got like an extra 200
megahertz on the core
anyway I'll put that information down in
the description below let's get on with
the benchmarks
so I'm just gonna do a noise test for
you guys and I'm gonna go through the
main levels that I've noticed with the
scraps car both out of the box and
overclocked also I'm sitting about 70 to
80 centimeters away from the card which
is where I usually sit when I'm playing
games so that's pretty real-world I
think so anyway the first setting is 32
percent and now this will be when you're
on the desktop or you're playing really
easy to play games that aren't too
graphically intensive so here's what
this sounds like so you can see that
whisper quiet and you probably hear the
case fans if anything overpowering the
three fans now will ramp it up to about
48 percent which is where I notice it
goes on the out-of-the-box settings so
you may be able to hear that I mean I
can hear it on my end it's a little bit
a little bit noisy it's not too bad so
out of the box settings it's pretty
quiet it's pretty good now if you're
going to overclock this graphics card
I've noticed that it can go as high as
about 80% or 78 percent 79 percent
that's where I noticed that it lapped up
too so I'll put that on now so as you
can see when you're overclocking the
graphics card the fans really step up
and they do become noisy so if you got
headphones on the isolated headphones
won't be a problem though if you are a
noise freak and you do want to over
close this graphs card then you're gonna
kind of be out of luck but anyway the
cool thing I do like about this grab
scars is the first thing I've seen this
is first time I've seen it the fans can
actually go to a hundred percent so will
that's 80 that's around 80% let's see
what a hundred percent sounds like
yeah that sounds like a jet like it's
really cool it's the first time like I
can literally feel the air flow coming
to me from where I'm sitting down it's
crazy
so these fans can really ramp up and
they do get loud so we'll go back
through it 80% and that's its high 80
percents about as high as it goes when
you're overclocking it and the
overclocks were really impressive but
let me go back down to 48 percent again
there we go so it's pretty quiet so out
of the box is gonna be pretty quiet and
then of course on your desktop it's
gonna be whisper quiet both on
overclocked and normal settings so hey
that's the noise test done let's move
over to the next part so in conclusion
what can I say about no.3 DS custom
cooled Hercules x3 980ti well actually a
lot of good this thing surprised me I
mean the performance figures right so
we'll talk about the 980ti first for a
980ti
it's a beast card it's absolutely huge I
mean you guys probably saw those
overclocked figures this thing can
handle 4k if you don't mind turning down
a few little settings and it will do it
so well you'll get an absolutely amazing
experience it'll do 1440p 144 Hertz as
well
phenomenal card now let's talk about the
actual card itself in terms of internet
3ds solution and this is kind of where
I'm like I'm for both I mean I'm really
impressed that it came in at the
cheapest it was the cheapest card I
could get it was like $100 cheaper than
MSI's twin fros oh and was 150 dollars
cheaper than gigabytes g1 and it was
about $80 cheaper than a reference
design where I live and this is what
it's all about it's about where you live
and what you can get this graphics card
for so if you can get this card a lot
cheaper than other competitors cards
then I would definitely go for it though
for me personally if I had the choice
and I don't know if there's any cards
right before I say this I don't know
even know if there's any cards that are
huge like the like the 780 lightning
that I had if I had the choice to pay an
extra 30 or $40 for say a 1.5 kilogram
cooler then I would because I had the
780 lightning in the past
even overclocked to the max that thing
was like whisper quiet and the surface
temperatures were really cool this thing
when you overclock it it starts to get
loud and the surface temperatures do
start to get pretty hot I've measured
about 60 degrees with my IR gun and so
it's kind of like you know you've got
that trade-off there it's a 1 kilogram
cooler it's just shy of one kilogram and
I think it's kind of not enough if you
want to overclock and have low noise
though if you're on a reference clock
and you're just happy playing a
reference clocks which I don't recommend
because there's a lot to be gained from
overclocking then you'll be happy you'll
be absolutely fine with this card it'll
stay quiet pretty much all the time
and do a good job of cooling this graphs
card and giving you a great experience
there for me since the overclocked gains
are just so big I would want to get a
bigger cooler just to keep the noise
down so anyway that being said though
the fans are phenomenal and it's the
reason why I could overclock so high
even though they get noisy they push so
much friggin
air like from where I was sitting down I
could feel the air from a meter away
it's some of these are some of the best
fans I've seen in my life they push so
much air even though they get noisy so
anyway let's get on with the review so
know I'm going to be giving this thing
four and a half stars out of five it
came in like a hundred dollars cheaper
than the nearest competitors products
and with that being said I don't even
know how the competitors products
perform they could get noisy when
overclocked as well I haven't tried them
so I can't tell you but for me this
thing honestly it hits that point it's a
beautiful 4k gaming card also when I
over clock it I'm usually wearing my
headphones so it washes out the
background noise anyway and then at idle
it remains whisper quiet so if you guys
are in the market for a graphics card
that is a beast and you know its
drawbacks and that is it gets a little
bit noise and when you're overclock it
then I can highly recommend this card so
