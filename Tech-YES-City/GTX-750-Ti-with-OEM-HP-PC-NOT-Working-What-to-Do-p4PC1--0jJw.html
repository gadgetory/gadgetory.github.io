brand coming to you guys today with a
video on incompatibility between certain
graphics cards and certain pcs behind me
I have a HP PC which I picked up around
two months ago Wiles out used PC parts
hunting and the problem it had was once
I cleaned it up and it does work
absolutely fine without the graphics
card in there but the problem I had was
once i installed a gtx 750ti in there it
just gets to this screen here where it
sits on the vga bios of the gtx 750ti
and it won't boot up into windows so
today we're gonna do some
troubleshooting see if we can get this
thing to work and try everything we can
but if we can't get it to work then
we'll have to find another purpose for
this PC other than gaming so now with
this PC the first thing we can try and
do is boot up and then try and update
the BIOS on this motherboard however
since we can't get into the boss itself
even when we boot up initially by
pressing f2 or delete we have to then
update the BIOS via Windows so we'll
need to go through some kind of
proprietary HP software in order to
update this so the first thing that came
to mind was to update the boss and
unfortunately in this case we already
have the latest boss and it doesn't work
so now what we can do from here is a few
other things I'm going to try another
power supply hook up a different power
supply a 850 watt gold power supply just
to rule that out as a factor since this
build only has a 220 watt power supply
to begin with and of course it could
cause problems although I'm pretty sure
that it's not the problem but let's hook
that up now and see if that is one thing
that we can eliminate
so now we've hooked up a much stronger
power supply and we're still getting the
exact same problem so this is clearly
not an issue with the power supply it's
clearly an issue between the motherboard
and the graphics card itself and
apparently after doing some further
digging and some further research it
spans from the fact that this
motherboard doesn't have secure boot
state-supported
and so graphics cards can have a problem
with this however after doing even more
research apparently the zotac models of
the GTX 750 and 70t eyes can work with
motherboards that do have this
unsupported state so in other words if
you get a ZOTAC gtx 750 or 730 i then
you can install that on any OEM and not
have problems or you shouldn't have any
problems it's just in the case of this
galaxy card it doesn't work with this
particular motherboard because HP
haven't bothered to update the BIOS now
I'm starting to worry because we're
coming into a bit of a problem we tried
updating the HP boss and this is the
latest BIOS and then we've also tried
changing around the power supply and it
still doesn't work and I've done a bit
of digging further and it's a Foxconn
motherboard however it's called a
Cupertino - and there's no BIOS updates
from Foxconn themselves on the
manufacturer website
so essentially Foxconn only made this
motherboard for HP they didn't make it
for their own market which means that
we're out of luck when it comes to
getting anymore BIOS updates because if
we try and force flash a different
Foxconn BIOS on this PC it'll just
completely brick it there's no coming
back from that also another thing we can
try is updating the VGA bars for this
gtx 750ti in just the hopes that galaxy
released a new bias that somehow
magically fix is the problem though it's
a very small chance so we didn't manage
to find a more up-to-date bias for this
galaxy gtx 750ti however the problem is
is that the device ID doesn't match so
the if the IDs don't match and you force
flash the BIOS then there's a real big
probability that you'll just brick the
gravis card of course you can come back
from
but it's a lot of messing around so
we're gonna try it one more thing and
that's just look for some other people
who have had this problem and what they
did to solve it so now we found some
other people in this problem there's a
guy who made a YouTube video about it
with the exact same motherboard that's
the Cupertino - and he had an induced
gtx 750 and he tried booting up and
holding alt and pressing f10 and that
worked for him others have reported
pressing f1 and others have reported
pressing f12 and having their pc
continue to boot so now we're gonna
spend a bit of time and just try these
methods out and see if they work and
we're still stuck at this vga bar
startup screen so guys with the pc
behind me i tried those fixes with f1
f12 f11 alt f10 i've tried everything
numerous times it just doesn't work the
trick with the f1 key however if you
look at the boss without a splash screen
that's that big HP logo that's a called
a splash screen one without that when
the f1 key prompt comes up that just
means you've changed hardware or you've
reset the CMOS and f1 essentially
continues on so in that case if you're
stuck at the boot screen hitting f1 may
indeed fix your problems but what you
see behind me is that it's just stuck
literally on the VGA bios screen so it
can't go past that so it's a problem
between this galaxy gtx 750ti
and the motherboard the HP cupertino - i
believe it is i don't know if it's the
three or the two I'm not too sure but we
couldn't update the boss I checked for a
BIOS update on both the Cupertino - and
the Cupertino 3 couldn't find anything
it's actually the latest boss that it
has already so this problem can't be
fixed from the motherboard manufacturer
unless HP come back around in 2017 and
decided to update it but also on that
note with the VGA BIOS
I tried looking for the VGA bus for this
750ti
and it's already up to date so as we
said before we were afraid that we'll be
Sol and we are indeed Sol with this
combination but not too worried with you
guys if you are in the market
all one of these combinations that's a
HP Dell Lenovo or IBM PC and you want to
slap in something like a 750ti then on
my website Tech City TV I'm going to put
up a list of all the different
combinations of motherboards and GPUs
that will work and ones that don't work
and ones that had problems and if it had
problems look out for that so if you
guys already have a combination like
this then let me know in the comment
section below and I'll update it for you
guys as soon as I can but with that said
the main for motherboard manufacturers
MSI Zeus gigabyte and asrock I've never
had a problem with installing a 750ti
or a 1050 TI or 1050 or anything like
that and having boot problems so if
you've got a computer and you buy it for
cheap and it has one of those main four
manufacturer motherboards in there then
you shouldn't have a problem anyway guys
I hope you enjoyed today's video if you
did then be sure to hit that like button
and don't forget to let me know in the
comments section below
if you know a combination that works
doesn't work or you had problems or you
have a friend that has a combination
like this as it's good to update and let
people know who are coming in to PC
gaming and make sure that they don't
have any problems when they want to get
a good gaming experience on a budget and
I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
