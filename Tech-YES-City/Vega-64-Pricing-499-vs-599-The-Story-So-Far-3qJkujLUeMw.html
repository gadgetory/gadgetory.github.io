being released and the MSRP is all over
the place but what is the cause for
these high prices seems everywhere I go
it's just he say and she say and I'm
just here to tell you guys what the
story is currently my thoughts on it and
how it's going to affect me going
forward as I want to review this card
but before I do I want to clear the air
and if someone says Brian but XYZ in the
comments in future Vega videos and I
just want to link them to this video to
save me some time
what a messy launch though new GPU
launches usually are messy however this
launch is also being clouded in scrutiny
from apparently and I'll emphasize that
again apparently as I have no proof of
anything in this video so take any of
this information of course with a spicy
grain a good old salt there are two very
strong rumors floating around and the
first will have it that AMD will under
supplying the standalone cards and over
supplying the games bundled cards in
this case otherwise known as the Radeon
black or Radeon aqua packs so these
packs are $100 more than standalone MSRP
prices and within those bundles you get
a copy of prey and Wolfenstein 2 and
also if you decide to buy a rise in 7
1700 X or 1800 X CPU and one of 3 X 370
motherboards the azusa rogue extreme
gigabyte gaming k7 or MSI gaming
titanium then you got an additional $100
discount off this combo though all three
motherboards cost easily over $200 and
not being able to buy a budget rise in
770 100 in this combo does start to see
less appeal especially for budget minded
consumers the last offer in these packs
is the option to buy samsung's new CF
791 ultrawide monitor and get a two
hundred dollar discount which is quite
enticing except for the fact that the
monitor costs over nine hundred dollars
the back itself apparently got
oversupplied and the standalone cards
were under supplied and if that's true
it doesn't make much sense at all since
the amount of people building an entire
system from the ground up would be a lot
less than people who just want to buy
the card I mean look at how slow CPU
clock speeds have come in the last five
years as opposed to GPUs and you can
definitely see the appeal of GPUs over
CPUs and hence the demand for buying a
grabs guard over building an entirely
new system
so apparently AMD wanted to sell those
bundles to get an extra $100 in the
hopes that most people wouldn't cash in
on any of the deals however I have heard
rumors that retailers are being told to
strip the cards out of the bundles and
sell them as standalone prices so again
I reiterate lots of he say and she say
out there at the moment though the
second rumors that the true MSRP prices
are really $100 from what am d have
initially stated and those initial $4.99
prices on Vegas 64 for example were
actually rebated to the retailer and/or
each Eller after they sold the card so
an example of this is that the retailer
sold the card for
99 bucks and got $100 back from AMD so
that would make up their shortcomings
and they would have effectively sold the
card for $5.99 and apparently this was
only on the first wave of very limited
supplied cards especially for the
standalone Edition this rebate I believe
has now effectively expired and in
gamers nexuses article when they pressed
the hard-hitting questioned AMD AMD
didn't have a direct response they just
said they couldn't control pricing and
danced around the main question by the
way Steve from games Nexus does some
awesome investigative journalism I'll
put the links to his articles in the
description below so anyway back to Vega
it was released an AMD have spoken on
the matter and they said that apparently
it's a simple case of supply and demand
and that they're doing their best to
make sure suppliers get stocked up which
in turn will hopefully get prices closer
to the suggested retail prices AMD
initially promised and in their defense
GPU launches in the last few years
especially hiring cards have typically
been sold out with prices that can go
well above that of MSRP for months so
like Steve from Hadron box said just
waited out a good month or two and also
wait for the atom board partner cards to
hit the shelves and then see how pricing
is from there if pricing comes down or
if it's a hundred dollars above retail
consistently in a month or two then
we'll know the truth though to further
complicate matters news on the internet
will have it that the hardware on those
cards is just simply too expensive to
sell the initial MSRP s promised by AMD
so retailers are forced to raise the
prices $100 higher or else nobody will
be making any money on these cards at
all though I will give you guys my two
cents I mean J already gave his two
cents in his boycotting AMD completely I
wouldn't go that far personally just yet
but the man does have his reasons and he
has stated why in his own video where he
says he has a trusted source that
confirms this whole fiasco however I
will give AMD the benefit of the doubt
for now I mean look at the Nvidia 3.5
gigabyte fiasco years ago apparently
there was a miscommunication internally
and honestly after going to events and
meeting some of the folks in tech
companies especially comput X with small
tech companies I'm not gonna name any
names but some of them only know
marketing they don't have a clue about
the actual tech itself so after you see
it in person then you do realize that
some of these defenses that may seem
impossible
they do start to seem plausible but
before throwing the hammer down on AMD
let's just give it a bit of time and the
main thing I wanted to throw into this
topic is quite simply us the consumer at
the end of the day we dictate the prices
with our wallets we always will if AMD
wants to charge too much for their
graphics cards well then I say let them
sit on the shelves personally I'm a
deals man and none of this faces me I
mean Intel Nvidia AMD they're all
publicly listed companies and their main
goals are to either profit grow or grow
market share they don't care about you
as an individual they certainly don't
cook your breakfast
they don't change your underwear or tuck
you in and kiss you to bed at night so
if you have a sentimental attachment to
Ira these three companies then I must
raise the question what is it with that
sentimental attachment I gave up mine
years and years ago and I recommend you
guys do the same if you haven't already
base a product on its merit and nothing
else if the product performs good and
it's good for the money or it does
something that can benefit someone in a
particular circumstance that another
product can't then awesome go buy it if
it doesn't then don't buy it though I
will say this in regards to the pricing
I will be basing my AMD Vega conclusions
in my review now on two different sets
of pricing as there's just too many
people talking about what appears to be
very strong rumors and just too much
talk of it to simply ignore and also
what about the miners well I don't see
that going anywhere in the short term
which does in itself add to the problem
anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this
video if you did then don't forget to
hit that like button and it's time for
me to start benchmarking Vega and making
some Vega content I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
