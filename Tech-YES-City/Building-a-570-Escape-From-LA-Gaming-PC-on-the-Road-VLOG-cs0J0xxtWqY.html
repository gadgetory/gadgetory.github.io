different gonna be like a build slash
flog journey let's see what we can come
up with in the end
so we just finished the build here this
is the initial phase and I'm actually
out of solder ports I need to go get one
more and I'm going to hit the road at 7
o'clock at night but I've got a 6700 a
viewer messaged me because he said he
saw where I was in need and he said he
has one that he doesn't know if it works
or not so he said I could have it for
free so I'm I'm gonna go pick that up
I'm gonna see if I can also quickly
snipe 8 gigabytes of ddr4 memory while
I'm out on the road and that would just
complete this bill that would then be
complete that's if the 6,700 actually
works and even if it did work whether it
works with this motherboard is another
story altogether so we're kind of taking
some Gamble's here and hopefully it all
pays off but let's see what magic we can
do
so just got back to the hotel and I went
over and saw it Jess and he just took me
in and made me dinner and introduced me
to his whole family and it's just so
nice likes some of you guys out there
just so nice to me it's really really
good and it just makes doing this whole
YouTube thing just that much better I
love just the hospitality and all the
love you guys give us and yes so that
was just it was so awesome meeting you
Jess thank you so much you didn't like
he said he didn't know if the eye 7,700
worked or not he tried it on a z 270
motherboard he didn't know if it worked
and so he gave us a couple of SATA
cables as well also gave us a USB
wireless dongle because I told him I
said I couldn't get the games installed
on the first PC I did he's like I got a
spare one we haven't used it for years
have it and I was like look dude I'll
give you some monies like no I don't
want money at all just get this CPU and
see if it works but anyway let's go and
see if this CPU does indeed work
so now we've been trying to troubleshoot
this thing just to get it all booting up
first and it just won't boot with the
graphics card installed so we are
booting it just off the motherboard at
this point in time but it's getting
pretty late
so I might just check if the i7 works
and then maybe try and go into the BIOS
or something and resolve this issue
because I do want to get this PC built
before I get out of here so we're just
testing out the i7 now and it indeed
doesn't work it's not working like the
i-5 was so it could be this motherboard
I don't have another model board to test
it with but this isn't looking good for
this i7 so it's now in the morning and
we finally got the gtx 1070 i to work
with this motherboard so you turning off
the secure boot and then turning on CSM
enables it to work fine the problem was
the i7 CT 700 didn't work so from here
on in we're gonna leave the hotel soon
so we're gonna pack up this schmick
looking PC and while we're on the road
try and piece together a sixty seven
hundred and another eight gigabytes of
RAM which I think I've secured via a
different deal if I'm able to land this
different deal
then it's probably gonna make up for a
video of its own because it's just such
good value anyway time to get moving and
hit the road
so we just picked up the matters deal
and it was insane we're gonna report on
it laid off but for now I'm gonna pull a
snakeskin and escape from LA
so we just got back into Vegas and now I
finally got some of the stuff listed for
sale and here it is here I've got to get
rid of this gaming PC straight away so
usually I'd ask a little bit more profit
but since kind of in a pinch for time
I'm just letting it go for a little bit
of a profit and then above that is the
other deal that we picked up for $50 a
pop I'm actually decided to try and flip
them because I wanted to get the 8
gigabytes of RAM out of there
so we'll actually profit to make and a
gigabyte stick if that makes any sense
but finally in Vegas and here's the
hotel room is actually pretty big it's
something like called the real or
something√∂ this place for like 50 60
Aussie dollars a night which is like 40
USD and then after that going to
Treasure Island so see yes here we come
but now another thing too is since I had
so much luggage I'm gonna bring the
other PC back in here and finish that
one off so put another 8 gigabytes of
RAM in that PC and then try and source
that i7 still because one crazy thing
about the i7 6700 was I actually had one
lined up for 160 us which isn't too bad
and also 32 gigabytes of ddr4 memory for
another 160 from the same guy so 320 in
total and then I try to butter him down
just another $20 and he just completely
ignored me so I guess the bargain
hunting here is a little bit different
and that's why it's so far so good
because I've only been seeing good deals
and then I've only been asking to people
just to shave off a little bit even
using that terminology new metaphor you
guys caught see for the win but now I'm
actually getting a little bit sick so
I'm gonna get some more vitamin C pump
that through me go get some other
medication as well because I can't be
sick for CES that's like one thing I
don't want to be as is sick for the
event that's like the whole reason I
came here but sure enough it's like
winter here and a lot of people are sick
and I caught something I'm coming down
with something so gonna get some meds
and bring that other PC back in here so
here is the PC now it is at least in
phase one complete because we can out
got sixteen gigabytes of ddr4 memory got
the i-5 6400 got the 1070 Ti and this
pretty
wicked-looking case i'm going to give it
some props it even has red LEDs
underneath so it definitely does look
like it could look good with a photo for
the flip but besides that I am trying to
line up a 6700 for this because it would
just complete this PC in my opinion I do
have a I guess an inquiry into a 6700 K
for a hundred and fifty dollars if we
were to pick that up it would leave this
build total now which is about five
hundred and seventy bucks plus 150 be
like 720 but we could then easily flip
the i-5 6400 for 50 bucks and even from
that 8 gigabyte take out we still have a
motherboard and another i-5 6400
available so this is definitely looking
like it's been one epic journey so far
but if we can't get the 6700 that I'm
definitely just gonna flip it as is and
because I just don't have time at the
moment time is really crucial for me and
I just don't have much time but I guess
so far with the 2 pcs we've already
built
there's definitely proving a point that
you can get deals in LA and I want to
try out Vegas as well after CES so
that's sort of another thing I want to
try out so la definitely can build a
high-end rig can definitely build a
budget rig as well this is looking super
schmack I'm gonna call it a night now
because I'm really tired I'm still
feeling a little bit sick and I get a
good night's sleep and then see in the
morning if I can get that C 700k if not
we'll report back so now the next night
we've checked in to Treasure Island for
CES and that is gonna start right now so
this computer is officially finished I
guess at what it is and that's with the
i-5 6400 and 1070 TI she's thinking of
ddr4 SSD hard drive so I'm gonna just
try and flip this after the one before
that and then yeah because I've got to
start CES now so there's no time at all
even to make a dedicated video towards
this PC even tonight the Nvidia
conference was on there now CRT X 2060
so pretty much got a report on that and
also Andy's rising 3000 series the
rumors surrounding all that will be put
to rest
and then I've got out a few booths to
cover as well so all that's coming up
see it's gonna be busy then after that
apparently mr. Christopher Yi wants to
challenge me in Vegas so essentially
with the hostel I'd rather just put all
off the sale take it up on mind and then
move on to CS and then after that I do
maybe one more use PC parts hustle in
Vegas and then we move on to Texas so
stay tuned for all that guys hope you've
been enjoying the content so far la is
definitely good for deals there's a lot
of deals there other than there for a
couple of days and I put together two
really good awesome price-performance
rigs as opposed to Vegas I won't have
time to check that out until after CES
so make sure you stay tuned
but I've already met up with a couple of
cool people already in Vegas are going
to see a few more in the next couple of
days so make sure you stay tuned enjoy
the coverage and if there's any requests
you want to see make sure you drop a
comment in the comment section below
hope you've been enjoying the vlogs and
I'll catch them the next tech video very
soon peace out for now but
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
