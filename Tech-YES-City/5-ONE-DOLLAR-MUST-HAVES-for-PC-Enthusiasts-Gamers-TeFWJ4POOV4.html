$1 mask tags if you're a PC enthusiast
and/or gamer when it comes to PCs and
gaming a lot of people tend to spend a
lot of money not just on the parts for
their pcs but also for the accessories
today I'm going to tell you guys some
real cheap one dollar must-haves that I
actually have around my house at the
moment that being said let's move on now
to number one so coming in at number one
is the banana stand
aka a headphone stand now when I went
down to my dollar store I was shocked I
was like wow you know companies are
asking like 20 30 or even 40 dollars for
a headphone stand when this thing will
do the job perfectly as you can see here
it just mounts my Philip's sh p 9500 s
perfectly fine and for a dollar I
couldn't ask for anything more so coming
in at number two is some thermal pads
and these can be had off eBay for around
about a dollar now if you're changing
heat sinks or you're putting new thermal
paste on your graphics card for example
when you actually take the heatsink off
some of those thermal pads can fall off
and then they can get things like hair
on them or dirt and it's just pretty
much impossible to clean that up not to
mention they can just get old and need
replacing anyway so if you buy some
thermal pads for a dollar when you're
replacing your heat sinks you can just
put some of this new stuff down and
you'll be good to go
so coming in at number three is the
infamous head phone or even microphone
extension cable now I actually use these
a lot around my house I probably have
like five of them at the moment I'm
using one plugged into my mic and then
plugged into the camera that's a 2 meter
extension cable and you can get these
things off eBay for a dollar and they're
honestly not that bad they're not the
sturdiest obviously you can go out and
spend more money but for a dollar you'll
be able to extend your headphones or
extend your mic for ease of use so
coming in at number four is the earbud
covers now these actually serve another
purpose and that is as a pop filter for
your microphone so if you're using a
microphone and it doesn't have a pop
filter on it you can just grab one of
these put it on top of your microphone
and you now have a $1 pop filter not to
mention you also you get the colors you
get red blue and black so coming in at
number five is the trusty alcohol wipes
I love these you can use them on
anything in your room cleaning your
monitor alcohol wipe no problems
cleaning PC parts no problems however if
you are cleaning PC parts make sure your
computers turned off I don't want to be
responsible for you getting electrocuted
also you can use it to clean up your
desks get the dust off whatnot clean up
dirty headphones the possibilities are
endless and it only costs you a dollar
so that's it for today guys they're my
top 5 must-haves for the PC gaming
enthusiast if you guys like this video
then please give it a like and if you
like the video format let me know in the
comment section below and I'll get back
to you as soon as I can
that being said if you haven't already
subscribed attack yet city for no more
nor the more tech news and reviews peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
