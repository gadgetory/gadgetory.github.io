yes fix it and as you can see here on
the desk this is the biggest yet this is
a show where you guys send in PC pots
whether they're broken or not broken and
I try and fix them and we give them
either a tech yes cleanse or if they
don't need a tech yes cleanse we give
them a better tech yes lovin now I also
got some letters sent in this month as
well so we'll quickly read them out and
first of all I will say that before we
get all the letters big THANK YOU to
Madden he has given us the biggest
donation yet on the channel you see here
8 1 terabyte hard drives an absolute
crap ton of ddr3 memory and 8 i7 3770 s
that's right this is an absolutely
massive donation thank you Madden and
next time you're on the Gold Coast I
told you drinks and dinner and all that
good stuff it's on me so big thank you
to Madden and all this stuff he said
works as well so I don't even really
need to test it because he has already
in the past
donated PC parts to me and they've all
worked absolutely fine except this
motherboard here so he doesn't know
exactly if it works or not I believe
it's at age 77 motherboard he said he
didn't have time to test it so we're
gonna test this out and see if it works
also these all these boxes here you're
probably seeing Jorge Velasquez who has
a website called JDM PC sales he sent us
in a letter and it said hi Brian we're a
big fan of your YouTube channel check
air city and we love the unique content
you've produced to date you've certainly
been an inspiration for our business
when it comes to Xeon CPUs gotta love
your Zeon's and Intel x58 motherboard
platform we've gotta love your x58 model
platform - absolutely amazing George
among other aspects as per our recent
communication via facebook messenger
we've collected some working and
non-working motherboards and graphics
cards for you enjoy the freebies and
good luck with them we hope these PC
parts allow you to produce another video
or two of the high quality engaging and
entertaining content we've come to know
and love from you passion + persistence
equals possibilities thanks a lot George
and it also equals a lot of use parts so
we're gonna go through this box see all
the parts we've got in here but also in
the intro you probably saw that case as
well Oliver came from Brisbane and he
donated an air 540 case he knows how
much I love the air series cases so he
donated a black air 540 and also he said
this motherboard here's the 87 g45
motherboard he can't get it to boot so
he doesn't know that the cpu or if
there's the motherboard itself so we're
gonna put that to the test to see if
that works
and then also we have another letter
sent in here from Julian he says he is a
loyal subscriber and basically we got to
read this one out and he says hi Brian
my name is Julian all the way from
Melbourne and I'm a loyal viewer of your
channel since the LGA 775 geomod days
the best pc mod known to man
and i've watched your content ever since
now i found this guy who goes by the
name of Ray on gumtree he gave me a
great deal on an online 290x last week
and I noticed on his profile he was
looking for a desktop system the link is
below to the listing and a link to his
profile he basically got scammed by some
toxic vermin on gumtree
and has barely any money to spare if you
read his listing he seems very genuine
and would be lovely to help him out I
thought this would be great content for
you as a gum tree and YouTube enthusiast
as great content but also helping
another fellow Aussie out cheers mate
keep up the great vids PS I thought this
letter would be the best way of getting
to you as I felt this wouldn't reach you
and I'm sorry for the multicolored text
printer was playing up so basically with
scamming on gumtree I've spoke about
this in the past it's one of those risks
you run when you buy used parts there's
always gonna be bad apples out there I
feel very sorry for Ray I've been
scammed in the past multiple times a few
guys to follow the channels for years
I got scammed on a graphics card I've
been scammed on two CPUs even in Japan
and then a motherboard I got really
hosed on so it sucks it is part of the
game if you were on the Gold Coast I
could help you out I just have to see if
you're genuine or not I can't tell if
Ray's genuine because I haven't met him
before and
anything about him because I I get
messages every single day from people
all over the world just asking for free
stuff and this is like as much as I as
much of people think I get this free
stuff sent in it's actually a lot of
people donate the stuff to help the
channel and keep the content coming
because they enjoy free content via
YouTube and so if I was to give away pcs
to one person it would be completely
unfair to everyone else but if you're on
the Gold Coast and I could see that you
were genuine and you are in need and
you've watched the channel I've known
you for a while then definitely I could
help you out I do help my friends out
locally here on the Gold Coast from time
to time with PC parts it is something I
do but unfortunately international and
people I don't know personally I
wouldn't be giving away parts is just
completely unfair to the rest of the
viewers today well let's get on with the
next donation here we've got the lettuce
and a CPU it is a-ok it's got absolutely
no writing on it and the lettuce says hi
check yes City here's my old 11:55 i-5 I
have no idea what model it is since I
lightly sanded the top to improve its
temperatures as of the thing called
laughing I but the CPU should work fine
share about the motherboard it was in
our shame about the motherboard is in
always unplug the power when turned off
anyway love the channel looking forward
to your new of vids regards aaron
johnson curie
thanks Aaron it's actually I think the
problem you may have had with the
motherboard is not the power off it
might be ungrounded if your computer is
on ground it is very risky to touch any
PC parts when they're ungrounded I have
actually killed two graphics cards in
the past albeit they weren't expensive
gravis cards are really cheap graphics
cards so very careful with your
grounding make sure your stuff is always
grounded otherwise you could indeed
damage PC parts also the last PC part we
got donated here was a b85 asrock pro 4
motherboard and they don't know if it
works or not at all actually picked this
off of a gum tree user who donated it
with a gratis car that they sold so it's
time to start testing PC parts out
so there's the first motherboard tested
and it actually works we did give it a
clean down with the data vac and changed
the CPU around the RAM around and then
it just happened to work off the primary
display from the motherboard but even
when we did that the USB keyboard from
corsair it didn't work and enable us to
press f2 so sometimes newer keyboards
for some reason they don't work with
older motherboards so use the Microsoft
Sidewinder that I've got from ages ago
and that worked absolutely fine so
that's a motherboard we can now use in a
build as you'll be absolutely fine let's
test some more parts
so we just finished testing this x58
motherboard the ud7 and it is working
absolutely fine the really cool thing
about it is it's got water cooling on
the Northbridge heatsink as well
added from the get-go so George you sent
us are really awesome board here not to
mention the vrm on this thing is super
Beefcake as well so that's a really good
score let's test out now a h75 would not
be 75 motherboard from MSI
so just finished testing this b75 MSI
motherboard now very weird problem with
this it has 99 written in the bottom
right corner so I believe it's just a
bias initialization problem and we'll
need a new bias but the problem is with
motherboards like these the biases
permanently sold it onto the motherboard
so it's pretty much useless I've tried
different CPUs different memory and
different memory slots even taking the
CMOS battery out and try and HDMI port
with nothing else plugged in to and
tried the HDMI port to a graphics card
as well so this board is pretty much as
good as broken so let's get on to the
next
so we just tried booting up this h 61
motherboard here from gigabyte and it
was weird because it did boot up and we
did just get a screen out of it but then
it cut off and it keeps cycling and
resetting and doing the same thing and
I've seen this problem once before
ironically enough with a gigabyte
motherboard I believe it has to do with
a faulty BIOS and it's sad because it
has a dual blast but it has no switch to
switch between the BIOS and since it's
again manually soldered on the board
it's very difficult to replace that so
this board will be going in the trash
pile as well also I did try two
different CPUs two different memory I
even tried plugging it in with no
graphics card on it all and it's still
resetting and cycling so pretty much dud
woohoo so now we know that this
motherboard works we've actually got
here the CPU that was sent in that's
lapped so I'm actually curious to see
what CPU it is and of course if it even
works after we've got this setup working
we can then proceed to test these to
grab his cards out and see if they give
us a signal - so the CPU in this
motherboard is actually in i5 3570 so
it's a non K so I'm not entirely sure
why you would bother lapping it unless
of course it was for a bit of practice
if it's your first time lapping but even
then you can get like $1.00 CPUs for
that but it does work it is a four core
four threaded zbu
and I don't believe the 35 70s were
overclockable on any motherboard in the
Ivy Bridge lineup even in a z77 you
probably get the base clock up 5% max
and even then it's not really that
reliable for overclocking so I'm not
sure my bulbs are doing that bit it
works so thanks and let's test some
graphics cards
so this 7950 here it actually does boot
up but it didn't boot up on the h77
motherboard it actually booted up on the
x58 motherboard
god bless x58 motherboards so this is
actually fully functioning and working
might need a thermal paste change but
this other graphics card here is very
bizarre because it doesn't boot up and
one of the fans is bastards so it may
need an oven-baked it does look like
it's got some signs of micro rusting on
it in that case I already tried booting
it up on different motherboards already
tried even putting in a razor to the
pins to clean them up fully just to make
sure that that wasn't the problem but it
does seem like it does have some life
left in it for some reason since it is
doing a normal boot it does look like it
could possibly work the oven-baked could
fix this graphics card of course I'll
try some other things in the future but
I'm definitely on a sideline this I'm
not gonna chuck it in the bin so it is a
possible working card it just needs a
bit more TLC I mean
Tyl check yes lovin so now the board
that Oliver sent in here it's a z87
motherboard but the problem is it's got
a Haswell refresh CPU in it that's a
forty seven ninety so before I even boot
this up I'm not even going to attempt to
because out of the box these did not
work with Haswell refresh CPUs so it may
need something like an i3 and then we've
got another two boards here one being
also a a b85 motherboard and another of
b85 too so I actually have to go source
a Haswell CPU from down the road I don't
have one on hand at the moment and then
I can test out these motherboards
properly and make sure that they
actually work as opposed to if I test it
with this CPU it could be a BIOS updates
that's one problem we're facing before
we test these three motherboards
new day new endeavors and we just tried
this out this is the Azrael be 85 pro 4
it was just boot cycling with the i3
which I know works because I just bought
it from a working computer so that is in
the trash file officially and these two
boards here are very interesting this is
the b85 Biostar now first I booted this
up and it had a few problems change
memory change the CMOS battery over and
then on the final boot it just gave me
some magic it was a really weird problem
and I think something around here might
be sensitive because when I touch this
area the screen literally blanks out so
this motherboard does work but it is
sensitive so I will have to sideline
that and then we've got last up here on
the z 85 haswell's z 87 Haswell range
we've got the maximus ranger 7 now this
board initially it did not boot with
this i7 4790 and in fact it kept boot
cycling it just kept switching off so I
then put the i3 in and it was having a
few problems but then I just decided ok
just gave it a little bit of a bang good
old just old-school style you know and
used to bang your PC to boot it up the
same deal applied and
now this motherboard is working
absolutely fine so I'm blown away this
is a really good motherboard z87 weak
nvme support so it's a really cool board
as for putting the i7 back in however it
does not work so this I 747 90 could be
faulty and that's one thing I've got a
test on another motherboard because
there would be such a shame if the CPU
is faulty because it doesn't really use
up a whole lot of power to begin with
especially compared to an overclocked
4790k but if it is faulty that's a
bummer but the motherboard works at
least it's working again it's been
resurrected so that's the power of
trying different things around and
getting things to work so there it is
we've got two working motherboards out
of that endeavor let's move on now to
the LGA 775 boards
so we just got done testing this g-41
motherboard and that didn't work
unfortunately it just gave fan speeds
with full speed and you know your
motherboards pretty screwed when you try
to do everything like change memory over
change CPUs clear the CMOS and then you
put a keyboard in and just the keyboard
isn't even initializing so this board is
pretty much a dud then we had this as
well the 650 SLI board tried everything
on this even took the little SLI key out
tried different memory different CPU and
again the fan speeds on the graphics
card were just full speed fan speeds on
the CPU cooler itself didn't change as
well so this one is pretty much a dud
board as well so there's two dodge
boards but the good news was was that
this G 31 motherboard this works
straight away with the Core 2 Duo and
also different memory so I did try call
to Joe's rather than trying like a q9
550 or something like that because that
can cause problems if the boss isn't
updated so did try the right CPUs we
just got two dud motherboards there and
that pretty much concludes all these use
parts so let's take a look at what
worked and what did
so now this is what we're left with from
the initial pile so first off here we've
got this gravis car which didn't work
but it is showing promise I will put
this in the oven bake file this 4790 I
will try it on a z97 motherboard in the
future I just don't have one on hand at
the moment because it could still work
if it doesn't work in a z97 multiple
that i know it works it will go into the
bin pile unfortunate because it's a very
painful Chuck away that one if it
doesn't work we had the 7950 that did
boot up on a particular motherboard
first off it didn't boot up on the h77
motherboard here which does work they
did boot up on this x58 motherboard
honestly this is my favorite prize of
the whole pcs that were donated the pc
parts this is just amazing it's got
water cooling on it it's x58 it's got
some of the beefiest vrm i've ever seen
in my life so it's big and I can't wait
to use that in a build this year the
maximum is range of seven it works with
the i3 so definitely gonna use that in
the future G 31 I might just do
something with the four laughs like does
a Core 2 Duo work in 2018 or something
like that that's a really cool little
pickup but in terms of like playing
games and beating out some of the other
stuff I've done on the channel there
isn't much potential here unfortunately
but this is what we got here b85 biostar
this thing was really weird but it did
work in the end so and as for the i7s
and the ddr3 and the hard drives that
MADD donated I know they all work he's
donated parts in the past before and
they've all worked absolutely fine he
pulls them out of working machines so
really big thank you to Matt and also
big thank you to everyone who donated
parts and also thank you to you guys for
watching the videos too if you enjoyed
this one - be sure to hit that like
button and also let me know the comments
section below if you've got any requests
as well I've got that 980ti build coming
soon also got a budget I three build
coming so the budget is coming back in
season and also as well they use parts
on will
coming soon so stay tuned for all this
goodness and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon and also don't
forget last resort if it doesn't boot on
just bash it peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
