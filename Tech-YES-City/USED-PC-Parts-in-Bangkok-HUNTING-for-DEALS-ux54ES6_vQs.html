what is up guys this is Brian from tax
City coming to you guys today from a
place called Pan to Plaza now if you
guys are into technology then you'll
definitely want to come here if you're
stopping to Bangkok now as soon as I
walked into this place I just got the
biggest nerd boner of my life like it's
incredible coming here if you want to
come here and look at some of the mods
I've got going on here and you're just
going to be blown away by this place
there's just so many cool things here
that I just can't list them all and I
mean I'll show as much b-roll as I can
throughout this video of some of the new
parts but on that note if you're
shopping for new PC parts here place
called ang applause or it's in bangkok
city if you're shopping from your PC
parts here the prices are a little bit
worse than the United States but that
would mean that it's a little bit better
than most other places in the world so
becoming like Norway or Sweden or even
Australia then you're going to get good
deals here as opposed to your home
country they'll come from the stage you
probably can't expect the best deals
from the United States so with that
being said though we're going to go shop
for some used PC parts and see what kind
of deals they got here up at the top
floor alright guys so we're just at a
place called secondhand to you and I am
joined by Mike and this place is a mecca
for used parts I mean there's use
motherboards here and look at this
they've got a whole box of H 55
motherboards here and he said you can do
em for about 50 USD so you guys know how
good those x34 70s are which I just did
a recent video off you get a new
motherboard and you're coupled with one
of those you're gonna have one kick-ass
PC they've also got a use P 55 gigabyte
over here for around about the same
price so I'm thinking I might take this
one because
yes I'm not sure about the compatibility
with that one especially with the new
gravis cards the gigabyte though I'm
pretty sure it'll work pretty well so
I'm definitely gonna look around a
little bit and then make up my mind
because I've got enough luggage in my
suitcase to probably fit in one more
motherboard but if you guys are coming
to Pangaea Plaza then you'll definitely
want to come to this store if you're
into use parts and come check it out
because the motherboards as you guys
know of one of the most important parts
and they're just so expensive in the
West to get one of these motherboards
and pick them up especially with those
cheap CPUs so this is the place you'll
definitely want to come to to pick up
one of these eh 55 or even p55
motherboards so I'm just here to place
called you are and they've got some
pretty cool deals going on here and the
lady here is just helping me out she's
calling around and asking if they've got
any p55 or age 55 motherboards so I'm
just waiting on a price here and then
I'll let you guys know what they come up
with for us yeah okay so this one we've
got the p55 855 around about $60 are
cheaper than that okay yeah so are
cheaper so maybe 1800
or 1700 okay I think this more than 2000
out okay thank you so we're looking at
the h97
and they've also got the H 55 or P 55
and they're going for around about two
thousand five which it would be at 60
USD you're still pretty cheap
considering how good these motherboards
are so let's keep looking around through
it another store now called KC IT and
they've got some free maids here which
aren't too shabby I mean you could
probably pick up better deals for some
of these premades but which keep looking
around through it another place now
they've got a h97 here for 1500 baht
which isn't too bad if you're looking to
do a Haswell build so that's not too
shabby we're gonna keep looking around
and seeing what else they've got here
also a 970 from gigabyte for like
ninety bar which would probably be
around $25
not too shabby either Turo to play is
called NJ now and they've got the
old-school super used but kind of like
the ones that you probably wouldn't want
if you were gone for an enthusiast LGA
775 so let's have a look at what
motherboards they got - so I've just
asked this store here NJ how much they
want for the socket 775 there and they
want around 1,000 bar which would be
about $30.00 though that paper
protecting the sockets
that's a almost as worthless as the
paper that's on it we just here at
another store and they've got a socket
775 mainboard for around about 40
something dollars so getting a little
bit more expensive up there they're
looking at laptops as well if you guys
are into laptops then you can definitely
come here and pick up something pretty
cheap if you're looking to hustle
you're probably bogging them down a
little bit more if you needed a laptop
so that's not too bad of an option
either so we're just in a place called
IT city and they've got a big focus on
new parts and to be honest the prices
like pretty much the same as what you
can get for peripherals and stuff back
at home so we're going to keep on
looking for some of those deals so we
just did a place called friend tech
computer and they've got a lot of
motherboards and CPUs but unfortunately
they don't have the H 55 or P 55 or even
LGA 775 motherboards here but they did
have some cheap motherboards that were
kind of like server mobos but not really
my thing at the moment since I love
overclocking ok so we've just done some
shopping around all the different floors
here for used parts and it's pretty
ironic because the first thought that I
bumped into the second hand
you what to you is like the best place
so far for picking up those motherboards
now the graphics cards I did see like a
gtx 770 for round about i think like
$200 so looks like they use grabbers
cards aren't too good of a deal here
especially when you compare it to what
you can get back at home though i might
go and pick up one of those PPP 5
motherboards from that first or
especially that gigabyte which will do a
pretty good job with the next 3470 so
I'm just at a place now called D life
and they've got a motorized slider here
for it's a 120 I think it's yes 120
centimeters or 1200 mil and it's also
got a motorized pan head as well so all
that for two hundred and 80 USD like I
saw this thing and I had to get it so
that's going to be a massive upgrade for
the channel I just could not pass that
up since you'll be paying anywhere for
like 600 USD plus for anything similar
in the motion on it is actually pretty
smooth perhaps a change of plans so I
don't know about the motherboard now I
just have to get this because it's such
good value
Georgie's not a place called MBK
shopping mall and I'm actually on a
thing called a talk to absolutely love
it they're really cool if you come to
Bangkok I recommend getting on one and
this place we're not gonna be too long
here because I have to get a flight
tonight but I'll see what deals they've
got even though I can't pick up in
alright so we're in the MBK shopping
mall now and there's heap of restaurants
even a supermarket and there's lots of
like clothes shopping and stuff here but
I'm told the 5th floor is where you will
get the tax so we're gonna head up
straight to the 5th floor and see what
they've got
ok so you've got this one for Edie from
Texas okay how much is it to be hundred
ninety bucks
alright guys so I just got into the
airport now and that MBK place ended up
being a complete boss there was like no
PC parts there whatsoever there was
however a heap of Android things and
like smartphones and also like
headphones and peripherals and stuff but
actually no PC peripherals either but
there was one really cool corner there
that was like a retro corner that I
think had a they were saying it was a
brand new NES though kind of highly
doubt that I mean it's about 500 USD but
if that was legit then that would be a
really good deal it's just I don't know
how to spot fakes
when it comes to retro hunting so though
at least we got ed this hand the red and
black colors I know that's his thing I
couldn't pass that up I know he's gonna
love this and it might even roll some
b-roll for him right now
the one a serious note it was so
hospitable towards me and my brother
when we went there for the trip of packs
so thank you once again it other than
that there's a few things I wanted to
touch on as well with Bangkok if you
come here guys seriously there was this
place I went to called the green noodle
there's a guy called Mark there that was
his nickname he just told me all the DLO
about Bangkok so basically if you travel
here you've got a hustle hard sometimes
so carry like a little bit of money in
your short pocket and don't flash your
wallet usually because as soon as you
flash your wallet that means people like
oh you've got money so they're going to
try and charge you as much as possible
so just carry a little bit in your
pocket and then they pull that out when
you're going to get a taxi and stuff and
bargain from there so a lot of the taxis
don't use the meters either
another thing too about Bangkok is the
suits here they're insanely good at some
places some places are just mediocre but
you know you get what you pay for here I
didn't get like a hundred dollar suits
and they're pretty much garbage but you
can get like two hundred and three
hundred dollar suits that are just
unbelievably good I mean I went to this
place called Briony and man their suits
are really good so if you want to get a
really good suit cut go cpk there and
he'll cut you up a really good suits and
just the last thing I wanted to touch on
before I get out of here was just
Bangkok in general I think it's been
like eight or nine years since I've lost
been here in this place has just cleaned
up so much like last time I came here I
remember those like stray dogs and it
was just so much pollution but this time
I came here man it is so clean and
actually had a really awesome time here
it was so good I can highly recommend
Bangkok if you guys are gone look like a
stopover from somewhere because I just
got like a one way through to Australia
and it was like virtually the same
prices getting a direct flight that's
one of the reasons why I came through
this time so absolute glass can highly
recommend it anyway that's about it for
me today if you enjoyed this vlog then
be sure to hit that like button if you
have any questions or comments or
anything that you would like to pick up
that I showed you on the vid that let me
know in the comment section below I mean
I thought some of those rigs were insane
now absolutely amazing especially that
chrome tubing man I'm going to be
looking into getting something done like
that on a PC hopefully so stay tuned and
I'll catch you in the next video very
soon peace out for now bye
so one huge tip as well if you want to
get money exchanged here there's a place
called super rich and it is like on the
corner in Siloam anyway there's this
place and they give you such good
exchange rates I was blown away so if
you get in here with cash just get a
little bit changed over the airport and
then just head straight to super rich
and get all your cash changed over there
because the exchange rates are things
like five pips or something on the USD
that's the best rate I've seen there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
