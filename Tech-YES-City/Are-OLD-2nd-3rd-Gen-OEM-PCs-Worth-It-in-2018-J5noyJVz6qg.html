doing all day pulling apart OMS and
there is a lot of stuff inside so let's
take a look because there's possibly
some things that could come out of this
video that I've never attempted before
so on the table here is all the stuff
and it's all been pulled apart and it is
a lot of gear so we've got hard drives
we've got ddr3 memory and we've also got
a lot of second third and fourth gen i
5s and i sevens and that's the main
cream of the crop when you pull these
im's apart and you get them for really
good deals you get those three pieces
and you can put them in other builds but
I was curious about these motherboards
because I'm told the Dells don't work
properly because they've got to
intrusion sensors and if they go off
then they don't work in other cases you
have to have them in the Dell cases but
what I was thinking to myself is that I
can somehow short these sensors whether
it be through some weird technique then
I can get these motherboards working in
normal cases so that's exactly what
we're gonna be doing here today
obviously some of them have proprietary
connectors in themselves like this
motherboard here but some of them do
have normal 24 pin motherboard connector
so they're the ones we're gonna start
off with and see what we can make happen
with the tech yes magic we run the final
home run here this is the last PC and I
pick this up on a deal for a hundred and
sixty AUD it was initially 270 the guy
was asking had a 2 terabyte hard drive I
seven pretty good power supply I
actually forgot exactly what's inside
but I remember I did bogging them down
because when I don't to take a look at
it
the computer was really slow and I was
like ok that's probably the hard drive
which it usually is when your computer
is really really slow so I managed to
say hey the hard drive is practically
worthless and I'll give you $40 less
than what we agreed on and he agreed to
take it so I'm gonna be trying to
restore this hard drive and see if we
can make it faster by baby petitioning
it and then hopefully there's it maybe
it's just some bad sectors that need to
be petitioned off
so here we are here the next day and
that PC over there it's the dirty
components I pulled out that was the
last of the builds it's actually pretty
dirty so it's gonna get a check yes
cleanse very soon but some curious
things that came about this sort of
endeavor here with all these OEMs was
this power supply here this Delta this
here has about 19 amps on the 12 volt
line but for some reason it's a heavy
power supply it just feels like it's
quality to the point where I'm gonna try
and get to solder connectors on this
thing and see if it'll power an R X 480
I know it's a stupid test but I'm
curious to see how it will go this power
supply here I've never seen a power
supply with just so little connectors on
it like it's got one two three
connectors and they're all really small
so that's that and then we got this
little cable here I've never seen such a
cute sized the camera can't even focus
on it this is like the cutest little PC
a 6-pin I've ever seen in my life I'll
show you guys a comparison against the
normal PC a 6 pin and then on the desk
these are the two most curious boards
that came out of this whole thing
because I've heard with Dells that they
don't turn on some sort of intrusion
sensor or something now they look like
they are a bit of a pain because they've
got these proprietary power connectors
up here but with this we're going to
quickly short this out now positive to
negative and see if that solves that
problem
now these motherboards here these are
the HP motherboards we can see here
proprietary connectors they're also in
the past with HP motherboards they've
been a lot more miss than they've been
hit so I'm probably just gonna bin these
because gravis cards in general don't
work the form factor it looks like it's
BTX
rather than ATX so yeah we'll probably
give them a mess
Lenovo's are good as always aces are
probably the best of the best because
you don't need to do anything to them
they've got the standard connectors on
them and they just pretty much straight
plug-and-play and then we've got these
two Lenovo boards here this looks like
it's plug-and-play
and that looks like it'll be easy except
the fact that it's BTX
and then this one here is sort of
looking like it might be plug-and-play
there is a proprietary connector that
- so why don't we get on to all this
om stuff and see what results we can get
so here's the Dell motherboard the first
of the first that intrusion sensor does
seem to work absolutely fine shorted off
like that but the problem is it just
boots up automatically as soon as you
hit the power switch at the back of the
power splay everything just boots up so
this must be a push to break system with
the actual front power switch which I'll
try and figure out how that works but
we've got so many error messages here
CPU fan failure hard drive failure power
button failure front input output
failure hard driver but it's still boots
in we'll get into the BIOS and I'm just
gonna play around and see if I can turn
off all those messages if we can and
then we can figure out the power switch
button this motherboard will be fully
salvageable so now here's the RX 480 and
it's been running UniGene heaven for a
total of about one minute and the screen
went black so he got up to about 600
sorry run up to about 260 watts power
draw from the wall and I guess this
little power supply it was just too much
for it to handle but it could definitely
handle an i5 and a 750ti or something
like that so it is a nice little unit
I'll probably keep it around because it
is bronze rated 2 and it hasn't blown up
it just can't handle the heat literally
[Laughter]
so now it's finally time to answer that
question of our OEMs worth it and I
think you guys already know of course
they are it all depends on the price
that you get the Matt a lot of these pcs
that I had here and pulled apart I was
getting them from anywhere from $80 to
around about a hundred and sixty dollars
depending on which generation of i-5 and
how much memory and if they had a hard
drive in them to those HP motherboards
I'm going to chuck them out because I
just do not want to deal with them if
you guys haven't seen the GT 1030 video
already I'll put it up here for you I
just had so much trouble with HP
motherboards in the
asked to the point now where if I see
him I'll just pull everything off from
the CMOS batteries the RAM even the
little CMOS clips because I can always
use them in the future and then just
pretty much Chuck the board not to
mention they do have a proprietary cable
instead of the 24 pin and also on top of
that you can't flash the bias so if a
graphics card gets put in one of these
things then it either works or it
doesn't work and I've had a lot of the
times misses with HP boards where they
just don't work so I mean yeah you can
use them for office pcs and stuff like
that but I just really couldn't be
bothered pull the cpu out and I don't
really have any i threes on hand at the
moment either
so I just don't want to look at it it's
what PTSD that little pals play it
almost handled the RX 4 80 it was a lot
to ask from it but it is a solid little
unit definitely be keeping that in the
kitty not to mention we've got a lot of
AI fives and AI sevens both second and
third gen even a fourth gen lenovo board
some of the motherboards of course like
the aces in the Lenovo's and even the
Dells had 24 pins on them already ready
to go so I just put them in a build and
I've got a whole PC that'll work I won't
have to go out and get another
motherboard however as you saw those
Dell motherboards they did have a
special type of power connector where
you needed a short the accessory to the
positive and then from there you've got
to somehow get a power switch connected
to the positive and the negative which
I've soldered them together so they will
work it's just I'm probably gonna have
to still again instead of putting a clip
off the power line in or power switch
sorry I'm then gonna have to put this
the wire and solder that to the positive
and then use the little negative portion
on the negative and then I will have a
power switch that will make this
motherboard work in a case but the
problem still then is that I have to
deal with all those error messages so if
someone does buy one of these pcs I'll
probably have to discount it a little
bit and just tell them look every time
you boot the PC you've just got to press
f1 and I looked in the bias and I
couldn't find any way to sort of skip
those messages maybe if there's some way
to skip that I'd love to hear from you
guys let us know in the comment section
below because I guess that's kind of
like a bit of a turn-off with those
motherboards but regardless they do work
and there is fourth gen motherboards
there as well third gen and second
so they will work really well hopefully
well it all comes down to it flippin pcs
and getting into this game is a lot of
fun you guys love the parts hunts and
OEMs I guess just make up a part of the
parts hunts if they're too expensive I
won't buy them but if they're cheap
enough then I will surely get them and
of course even if you don't use those
motherboards as I said before you just
pull out CPU on the RAM and all the
other goodness and you're still going to
be collecting your money's worth
especially since CPUs especially unused
CPUs like second third and fourth gen
CPUs they've gone up in price and not
just gone up in price in Australia
they've also gone up in price overseas
so there seems to be a bit of a
stranglehold at the moment on the supply
of these older CPUs and I hope they
don't stop because then as they stop
we're sort of forced to go back to new
parts and buy ddr4 memory and new ddr4
memory is just too overpriced
I wish they'd really fixed the ddr4
memory prices anyway guys hope you
enjoyed today's video if you did then be
sure to hit that like button let us know
in the comment section below do you deal
with the OEMs or not if you don't then
let us know why not if you do let us
know your success stories and if you've
got any tips and tricks and I'll catch
you guys in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
