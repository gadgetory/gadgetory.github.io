city's verandas you coming back to you
guys today with a quick look at the in
my opinion the sweet spot for has well
and this is the 4.6 gig overclock so you
guys once you load up BIOS this is the
msi UEFI boss once you load this up I
just want you to go down to overclock
and just in here adjust CPU ratio just
pop that up to 4 6 or 46 and that will
give you a 4.6 Giga its overclock leave
it on fixed mode because fixed mode is
just all the cores running at 4.6 gigs
which is what you want the other
settings I'm going to look at them in
the next month or so so I can give you
guys the best overclocking - Dora I can
and there's just so many extra options
on the msi UEFI bios compared to the
asrock z77 anyway but yeah down to core
voltages for me it was 1.2 - so after
running it running a few games doing a
bit of rendering doing better tasks I
figured this was looking like my optimal
voltage setting 1.2 - so yours may be a
little bit higher yours may be a little
bit lower so it depends so yours may be
you just got to get that and you know
find your level of optimal voltage so
let's get this booted up so just save
that we can go here we can save that
overclocking profile so we can save that
as 4.6 is my 4.6 here save it bang yes
and we can just exit the BIOS exit the
BIOS now and just quickly run a stress
test for you guys show it all running
and boot it up so yeah the msi UFO boss
is really good I'm liking at the moment
I should just say BIOS because they're
all becoming UEFI now yes sir yeah msi
bias is really good I'm loving it yeah
so it's good I really like this
motherboard - it's an amazing
motherboard it supports these stable
overclocks
haven't had one hiccup with it yet so
I'm going to start recommending them up
in my budget builds and the budget bills
are coming very soon don't worry they're
very soon like my next priority so
getting these overclocks done so load up
I 264 it actually is a really good
good program so just go to system
stability test here you just click on
computer here go down to sensor and you
get it for 30 days free and that's all
you gonna need to find your overclock
anyway so just click start cpuid here we
can confirm the 4.6 so we got the 4.6
gig running here that's confirmed
oh yeah booyah and there you have it
guys 4.6 gigs on as well this is the in
my opinion this is a sweet spot this is
what the 4.8 I mean yeah I was getting
close to 1.3 volt and people will like
mmm you know you shouldn't run into 1.3
and you know yeah I'm not really keen to
be one of those guys who fries his chip
you know because I remember when
Ivybridge first came out people were
like go on for these overclocks and a
lot of people fried their chips like the
initial batch I don't want to be one of
those initial fries so anyway yeah guys
I hope you enjoyed this over Columb is
4.6 and it's running you can see here
it's hitting maybe Sun hits 74 before
but that's absolutely fine anything
under 80 is pretty good temps I think
you know maybe my chip is a good chip I
don't know but it's definitely I think
4.6 should be obtainable on most I five
or six seventy case the i7 4770k should
be very very similar I don't imagine I
imagine to be a little bit better as
well sorry guys
peace out for now if you have any
questions please comment the comment
section below if you liked this 4.6 gig
overbook please give this video a thumbs
up and I'll see you guys soon with the
budget builds guys peace out for nampara
