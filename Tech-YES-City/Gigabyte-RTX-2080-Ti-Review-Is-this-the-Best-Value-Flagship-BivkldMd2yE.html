practically every twenty eighty and
twenty atti
out there on the market but here we've
got the gigabyte Archie X 20 atti and
what sets this apart from a Zeus or MSI
for instance well this one I'm told is
going to be coming in an MSRP so you're
not gonna be paying any premiums
unlike the Strix where you were paying a
premium but you were getting a beefed up
PCB a much bigger cooler and that was
practically taking up three slots
however gigabyte haven't skimped out on
really anything here which is the good
news they've got a two and a half slot
cooler and the good thing is about this
cooler is and I'll pull up the noise and
temps results for you guys already is
that this thing is doing a great job of
handling all the heat output that the
r-tx 28 ET I can put out and to this
date I think this is one of the most
powerful and also power consuming cards
out there on the market of course what
else may differ this card from the
competitors cards let's take a look
welcome back to checkout city and here
it is gigabytes edition of the twenty
atti features 382 milf Ann's and it's
practically the same cooler which is two
and a half slot that went on there 2080
with this cool is well handled the ti
without any problems at all and the good
thing is at 60% fan speeds the noise is
pretty low and the temperatures are
going to remain low too when you do
leave the fans on Auto something
interesting about this card was that it
actually ramped up the fan speeds a
little bit higher than that of 60% but
the temperatures still creeped up a
little bit higher too that has to do
with PWM control constantly fluctuating
and so it looks like it wants to sit at
around 70 degrees and the ambient
conditions in here we're about 23
degrees C though that aside let's take a
look at some gaming results for you guys
and the first one here we'll pull up is
Far Cry 5 and what happened in this
benchmark was kind of interesting in
ways because we saw that the 20 atti
from gigabyte was before me pretty much
neck and neck with the Strix rog 2080 Ti
and so this was on a test bed with a 78
20 X at 4.5 gigahertz with 16 gigabytes
of memory ddr4 clock to 3200 megahertz
and as we're going through the 4k the
results were pretty much neck and neck
and one thing I'll quickly pull up now
is the overclocking results this here
did show higher over clocks than the ROG
Strix and now that does come down to
Silicon Lottery but the interesting
thing is this only has a power limit of
11% extra so you get a hundred and
eleven percent maximum power limit and
the ROG Strix for example had 125
percent so you do get that extra power
limit and that did show in the power
consumption tests where this was I think
being limited by that power limit so if
we upped that for 25 percent this may
have indeed beat the ROG Strix which may
have not been as well as a silicon
lottery winner as this was so going
through the time spy results showed that
it was pretty much performing
neck-and-neck with that of the ROG
version but also beating out the 2080
and also the 1080 Ti by a big chunk and
then moving out a 3d marked fire strike
which is more of a 1080p benchmark but
we can still see that in older titles
there's not going to be a huge
difference between the 1080
gie in the 20/80 for example and the
2080 i isn't going to pull that fire
head so what i've done here with my
testing and what i'm going to do more
research on is i think games that
originated from dx9 was simpler effects
for example you won't see that big of
the margin between the 1080 TI and the
2080 TI and even the 2080 for example
and you'll see the 1080i even beating
the 2080 in some of those titles but
when it comes to games that were
released in 2018 for example that's when
the 28 ETA and also the 2080 start to
pull ahead of the 1080i so that's
something that I've sort of seen a
correlation with the some of the games
that I'm testing here what if warcraft
will pull up this for you guys 28 ATP
and this is a ridiculous resolution but
at this resolution maximum setting I was
able to properly stress all the graphics
cards here in the Czech yes studio and
what we found was the 20 atti from
gigabyte was pretty much neck and neck
again with the ROG both overclocked but
at stock settings the ROG card was
pulling ahead by a little bit I guess it
has to do with the massive oversized
cooler on the ROG itself but now moving
over to Crysis 3 and 4k results here
showed that this was just falling behind
a little bit behind the ROG in this
title and I know Crysis 3 from
experience does chew up a lot of power
it's a very how would you call it power
supply hungry game both maxing that of
the CPU and the GPU and a lot of
occasions but moving over to 4k show
these same results continuing from 1440p
so the ROG does have its advantages and
in certain titles that I guess utilize
all the GPU itself that's when you'll
see that extra power limit when it comes
to overclocks pulling ahead move over to
scum this showed pretty much a
neck-and-neck race between both these ti
models at 1440p also pulling out of the
2080 and 1080i by a comfortable margin
and then following that to 4k we saw
similar results yet again and then on to
destiny to both 1440p and 4k results
showed that the TI models were pulling
ahead the ROG just ever so slightly
ahead even though the gigabyte variant
did score higher over clocks in general
I'll quickly pull up the maximum clocks
obtained here in stress tests that were
possible on this gigabyte model what we
got here was an extra 100 88 megahertz
on the core clock itself
and then on the memory I was able to
just max the slider with a thousand
megahertz I was quite shocked at how far
the memory could go and I didn't get any
crashing but again I do have to sort of
bring that back to the power limit here
especially in times by extreme where the
ROG had lower clocks but it was still
scoring pretty much the same results in
that particular benchmark regardless of
the clock speeds but this little
behemoth here looks like it did win the
silicon lottery and move over to pub G
really showed the twenty-eighth ETI
flexing yet again over its younger
brother the 2080 and also the 1080 TI
scoring well into the mid 100's in FPS
at 1440p high settings move over to 4k
high settings showed similar results
with both the TI big brothers flexing
over the younger brother and the
previous flagship pulling up here the
Final Fantasy 15 demo which supposedly
has DL SS enabled this showed some
massive gains over that of both the 2080
and 1080i yet again though on that note
of DL SS and also rate racing I will
have to point this out just like I'm
pointing out every time we talk about
our TX series which the R stands for
ray-tracing and they hyped up all these
new technologies until they give us
something that's properly playable and
it's not even beta it's actually in
games implemented then we can start to
hype that up and experience it and judge
it but until then it's really a letdown
in my opinion because the RT X really
doesn't stand for anything at the moment
I think of this card more of a GTX card
than an RT X card because what we're
showing you guys here is really all we
can show you and that is raw gaming
performance yet I really would love to
see some of these extra eye candy
features and also DL SS for example
which is supposedly enabling better
frame rates but also better eye candy as
well they keep in mind when I'm watching
back this Final Fantasy 15 demo I'm not
really seeing a huge improvement to my
eyes the Star Wars reflection demo shows
the 2018 and 2080 TI performing neck and
neck here because the benchmarks capped
at 24 fps and so there it all is on the
table with the gigabyte 2080 TI this
card is really nice it feels nice in the
hands it weighs exactly
same as the 2080 model that we had come
through here so it is using the same
color it is two and a half slot and it
will do an absolutely fine job of
keeping this card under wraps
I do think gigabyte are really getting
it right in the 2000 series you've got a
card that looks clean it performs well
and the best thing is they include a
four year warranty at least for the
people down under here in Australia
you've also got RGB on the side of the
card which you can change to any color
by the gigabytes software and for inputs
and outputs you've got three DisplayPort
outs and also HDMI 2.0 and a USB type-c
if you wish to utilize that technology
on the side here you've got support for
Nvidia's new technology of bridging two
video cards together and that's envy
link which is the successor to SLI and
really when it all comes down to it
that's about it with the RT X xx atti
you're going to be paying a premium as
I've said in the previous reviews that
I've done on these cards but with the
2080 ti in particular you are going to
get a premium experience it does beat
out the 1080 Ti by a healthy margin does
beat out the 2080 by a healthy margin -
and in my opinion when I reviewed the
2080 I liked what the board partners are
doing with the cards they're doing a
great job of implementing good coolers
great aesthetics but I feel like they've
been let down a little bit with the 2080
from Nvidia 2080 I however is that
beefed up option it is the one for the
people who want the best and they don't
even want to think about buying a 1080
TI they know they want the max
performance they don't want to max those
sliders at Ultra settings are the 1440p
ultra wide or 4k and they're going to
get the best experience possible of
course you are going to be paying for it
frames per dollar isn't really there but
also on the same token flagship
performance never has been about value
for money the mid-range cars like the
2070 I'm sure they'll be hitting
sometime next month so maybe they
hopefully will bring some better value
than the 10 series predecessors and I'm
looking forward to taking a look at one
of those for you guys but ultimately
what this review boils down to is this
card right here and have gigabyte done a
good job of making a good cooler and
also implementing all the features to
really extract the most out of a 20 80
TI and in my opinion yeah
so they've done a really good job
they've also included a four year
warranty which is pretty damn huge
especially for a car that's going to be
coming in at MSRP they've included all
the options that I would want from an
r/t x20 ATT I personally and that's
about all there is really to it if you
guys enjoyed this video then be sure to
hit that like button let me know in the
comment section below what you think
about gigabytes new mm Series coolers
and the aesthetics love reading your
thoughts and opinions as always and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon
peace out for now bye
when the 1080 I may even beat the Terr
this showed massive gain this showed
massive gains I've been moving now of
and so here it all is with our little
friend here on the table from gigabyte
this really doesn't have a name it's
just the gigabyte</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
