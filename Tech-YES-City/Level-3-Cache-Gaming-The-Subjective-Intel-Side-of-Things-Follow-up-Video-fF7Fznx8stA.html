the follow up video on the level 3 cache
video that I recently did where I
compared the Pentium versus the Xeon
versus the i7 5820k and today I'll be
more of a subjective based video over
some dota 2 gameplay so I hope you guys
enjoy
welcome back to jackass City ladies and
gentlemen this is brian coming back to
yesterday with some gameplay commentary
over some dota 2 so I hope you guys
enjoyed this format I haven't done it at
a long time but as I've said in the past
this is just a quick and easy way for me
to relay thoughts and opinions and today
is gonna be one of those videos that's
very subjective and I'm gonna talk about
my multiplayer experience in particular
with the Zeon versus the 5820k so that's
more of a 8 megabytes versus 15
megabytes of level 3 cache there so
hopefully this video should give you
guys some extra thoughts and opinions
though for what it's worth the on the
intel side of things it certainly
doesn't make too much of a difference
and I'm gonna say straight up that my
conclusion in the single-player
benchmarks in that previous video did
the conclusion will still stand for what
it's worth that conclusion is rock-solid
for the Intel side of things and one
thing I'll clear out of the air straight
away as well is that the AMD CPUs I have
not tested them so I cannot give you
guys a concrete recommendation there as
some people in the comments are actually
telling me that they're getting a much
better experience on an FX CPU than they
are on the Athlon CPUs and now the
Athlon series if you guys didn't know
have absolutely no level 3 cache on
board so that's something to look out
for there if you are getting an Athlon
CPU and I mean what effect does this
have on gaming I can't exactly tell you
guys because again I haven't tried this
CPU though where I think occasional
level 3 cache makes more of a difference
is in multiplayer games and this is
because your CPU or generally on most
gaming PC's is that the CPU is actually
processing the IP packets that's the
Internet Protocol packets that are being
sent to and from your computer so this
is actually going to take up some CPU
resources as well and so level 3 cache
will certainly help in that regard
especially since the packets I'd imagine
would be very repetitive so I think
we're level 3 cache makes more of a
difference would be in multiplayer games
so I'm gonna talk to you guys now about
my experience with World of Warcraft and
that's the latest expansion warlords of
Draenor which was released last year and
so I had a good few months
actually played this game on both the
Xeon and the 5820k and what I noticed
was and this was both on the GTX 970 at
the same clock speed so what it's worth
the differences between these computers
there was only like ram speeds level 3
occasion you had a few more calls and
threats but what a Warcraft doesn't
really benefit all too much once you
start going past 8 threads but for what
it's worth this game ran a little bit
better so this is we're going into that
anal-retentive zone now and I'm sure you
guys wouldn't happen anyway other way
around tech yeah city brother but that's
all good so I'm gonna go into these
nitty-gritty details and you know for
what it's worth these two CPUs the Xeon
you know 1231 v3 and the 5820k they're
pretty much two of the best CPUs you can
get for gaming at the moment and Here I
am critiquing but for what it's worth I
noticed what when we're in very
populated areas the Xeon would stutter
so with the 5820k
and I mean I'm sure any other CPU would
when you go like 40 people you suddenly
turn the screen and there's like 40
people on your screen and so what
happened though with these little
stutters or these little hiccups is I
noticed that they were more noticeable
on the Xeon than they were on the 5820k
so you know and casian aleihi
occasionally exhibit these hiccups and
when it happened it was less noticeable
on the 5820k and now i'm going to assume
that that's due to the 5820k just having
a lot more level 3 cache on the CPU
itself so I think that's an area where
it can make a difference in is in
heavily populated multiplayer games for
what it's worth and remember this was
only happening probably once every five
minutes or something like that it didn't
happen all the time so again this all
relates back to that conclusion that I
made in the single-player benchmarks it
should be a second priority thing there
for what it's worth I think it did make
a difference and I think level 3 cache
can contribute to a more smoother gaming
experience so I just thought I'd let you
guys know that's
what's happening with world of warcraft
and the multiplayer games now I know
there's gonna be people out there like
what did you benchmark you know level 3
cache on multiplayer games and that's
sort of venturing into the realm of hey
there's gonna be variants and it's going
to suck like benchmarking multiplayer
games I mean I could attempt to do it if
I had I guess a few guinea pigs who
would just pretty much do the exact same
thing in the benchmarks if they were
willing to but that would be something I
wish to explore but but for what it's
worth benchmarking multiplayer games is
actually very hard if you're trying to
get a hundred percent accurate results
like I do with the single-player
benchmarks because all the variables are
the same so I mean I could try and run
some multiplayer benchmarks and see how
it goes but for what it's worth I'm just
going to give you guys my subjective
opinion of playing World of Warcraft for
a few months and so I think level cache
level 3 cache does make a difference and
it does matter though again with that
conclusion it should be something that's
the second priority your first
priorities being the price of the CPU
that CB the core and thread count and
the clock speeds and the actual
instructions per cycle or instructions
per clock however you want to call it so
that's up to you but anyway I guess I
hope you enjoyed this video if what it's
worth and if you did please give it a
thumbs up now also again I'll read over
Issei oh I will say again is that I
haven't tested these things on the AMD
side it could make much more of a
difference I'm not too sure I'd love to
get my hands on an AMD CPU though from
what people say in the comments it does
make more of a difference on the AMD
side of things especially on the Athlon
since you've got absolutely no level 3
cache there and so what impact that has
on gaming and our frame rates not actual
FPS actual frame rates are not sure so
that's something that I would love to
test though I don't have an FX CPU
around here and I don't have an Athlon
CP around here at the moment either
and they don't even sell them in Japan
like the names sell Apple TVs in Japan
so I'm crap out of lockdown I have to
order one in from the states as long
like that so anyways what it's worth
yeah I hope you enjoyed this video I'm
just right rumbling and bumbling on now
and I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye
aboutwell tech and gaming so it's gonna
be cold tech gaming weekly and it's
gonna be aired on Thursday mornings at
7:00 a.m. Australian Eastern Standard
Time and I think that's like in America
Wednesday afternoon I like about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
