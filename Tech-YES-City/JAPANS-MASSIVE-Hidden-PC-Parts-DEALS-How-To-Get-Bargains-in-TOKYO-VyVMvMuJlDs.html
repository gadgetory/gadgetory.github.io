Tokyo Akihabara and Austria that got
done by the yes picked up a lot of good
deals but before that it was a bust in
Italia but here we are on the home run
and this is the country where people
generally chuck out their used stuff so
a lot of the times I turn trash into
treasure but when it comes to Japan I'm
gonna be turning tarnish silver into
gold so first off we're gonna start off
here then later on we're gonna get a car
and then head around and pick up them
deal but also got in late last night
crashed out and now I'm in the middle of
Tokyo and there was a place here that
does really good exchange rates near the
mid market rates so I'll put the link in
the description below if you're in Japan
give these guys a call and events they
speak English and organize to get your
money change over here see don't get
ripped off but with all that out of the
way get your used parts hunting capes on
and let's go find them deals
now generally if you're in Tokyo there's
gonna be a lot more competition when it
comes to getting used price-performance
deals as we go out of the city you'll
find out there'll be a lot better
bargains going on the right behind me
now is a place called SKU Moe which
generally in the past I've gotten a lot
of decent deals out of this place
especially for gravis cards so we're to
go on inside see what they got on the
shelves and especially since the Logan
Pole thing you tubers are generally
frowned upon in Japan so if we can sneak
some footage in we will so we just got
out of school oh and that place was a
gold mine so we just picked up an X 79
motherboard up4 got this for about a
hundred and fifty US I think if I had to
do the calculations right I'll put all
the prices up on the screen anyway but
we ended up getting a also a six core 12
threaded 7800 X a GTX 780 and a GTX 980
as well as the 16 gigabyte kit of ddr3
memory now I did manage to get a 5%
discount out of them on top of the fact
that I don't pay any tax because I'm a
foreigner on a tourist visa so we just
got an absolute bargain on all these
parts now the good thing is we just got
that 3930k in austria so that coupled
with the x79 motherboard coupled with
the memory we've got ourselves a
bare-bones six core 12 credit kit here
but man what a bargain already the first
stall we've walked into already cleaned
up and now we're gonna continue around
and see what else we can find here in
the beautiful land of Tokyo
so we just gotta have this place called
shop inverse and they had some really
good deals on systems mainly the two
that I saw had i7 4770k dr3 memory
motherboards one terabyte hard drives
they'll go on for a little under 300
dollars so if I lived close to this
place I would definitely be going in
somewhere like here and just gotten all
these systems because they got some
really good deals there's also an X 56
75 in there of course being a traveling
today I can't really carry around a
whole system with me so we're gonna keep
on looking see what the other stores
have
so we just got out now of sofmap and
went to a few other places just before
that and their new parts mainly in the
process of new parts seem to still be
quite expensive especially for new
gravis cards they all have the keyboards
and mice on display so a pretty good
thing but this time with soft map when
we went into the used floor section it
was very weird like I did manage to get
a 3930k for 8,000 yen which is a really
good price they even had one more on the
shelves but we already picked one up in
Austria so I've already got two 39:30
case but another thing they had on the
shelves was like 2,000 yen for a
motherboard and I thought well that's
great I'm gonna put that in the kitty
but after that I then found out the
thing doesn't even turn on and then we
had a graphics card a 660ti that was
4,000 yen and they said there was no
signal coming out of it some way I'm
thinking to myself why are they even
selling this stuff because usually they
just mark that clearly as junk because
they want nothing to do with it but they
have this stuff in the shelves like in
the glass shelves so very weird maybe
times are getting desperate who knows
but let's go now across the road to a
place called dos Peres and see what
they've got so we just ended up getting
out of dose power and that place is
pretty much a bust except for one thing
and they had i79 70s in there and I
picked one of these up for around 60
bucks and now the difference between
these and a Xeon is that these CPUs will
pretty much work in any x58 motherboard
now Georgia from JDM PC sales in the
Kenya fix-it episodes you may have seen
him send over an ex 58 motherboard this
didn't work with the C on the six core
12 threaded Zeon's so that's why I'm
civically getting one of these CPUs so I
can chuck it into that motherboard and
still have a six core 12 threaded CPU to
play around with
now just across the road here is another
store that is actually doing even better
prices on whole systems than the shop
inverse that we saw before so if you're
into gutting
pc's this place would definitely be
worth a look they've got x58 rigs going
for around about $60 and then they've
got p55 machines going for around $40 so
the prices are really good at that store
in particular if I had a ute I'd
definitely be pulling up here just
pretty much cleaning the place out but
anyway let's try and find a few more
stores in Akihabara as I'm pretty much
ready to go as I've filled up all the
luggage got all the deals out of here
and I've at least checked around all the
places that I know have good use
price-performance but we'll see what
else we can find if we don't we'll just
jump on a train and get on out of here
so I just got on the train about an hour
out and we've gotten out of Tokyo and
Tokyo is great for sightseeing but for
living it's really crammed so I'm just
going to my friend's house now and this
will conclude day one of the deals
hunting but before I got on out of here
I checked the heart off and that was a
bust I also went to the sofmap new place
to see if they got some new parts and
they did have gravis cards of course
they're overpriced but another thing as
well there's a lot of mining cards
stacking up at some of these places that
sell secondhand pots 1070 s 1070 TI's rx
570s there's a lot of them so you can
expect prices to come down soon because
there's a crunch and when there's a lot
of stock taking up shelf space they'll
need a clearance sooner or later on the
other hand as well I did see the
microsoft intellimouse as well I didn't
realize they refresh this but this is an
absolutely phenomenal Mouse at least
back in the day remember when Microsoft
used to make hardware it was more like
they should have called their company
Micro hard because that's what I was
getting when I was using some of their
products back in the day so hopefully
I'll reach out at rocketjump ninja and
see if we can take a look at that new
mouse with that aside we're gonna get
some rest
and then we're gonna jump on in the car
and go for the real hunt so here we are
now on the next day and I've got my
little boy he's coming with us he's
gonna come hunting and I've also got
Damien you may remember him from
previous vlogs where we've gone around
parts hunting in Japan and we're
actually using his car today so big
thanks to Damien for doing that and yeah
guys this is the first hard off that
we're at now we're gonna go inside see
if we can find some deals I'm gonna be
looking for PC parts and Damien's gonna
be looking for retro parts so we're
gonna be doing all this today so strap
on in and let's go inside and see what
deals we can find
so right behind me now is a new store
that we've sort of just dropped into on
the way in from going from one heart off
to another heart off now that previous
heart off we just went to was really
interesting because I ended up picking
up a tripod a really good tripod for
around about 50 US dollars as about
5,400 Japanese yen it has a really good
fluid head on it it's exactly what I'm
looking forward to replace my current
travel tripod which is really it's it's
had its days I mean after three years of
use and traveling and abuse it need to
replace it and so I found this really
good tripod absolutely awesome if you
guys are hunting in Japan stores for
parts and you need a camera tripod I
highly recommend just trying them out
and seeing if you can piece one together
but besides that computer parts what
they've got going on here is something
that's changed a lot since I've been
dude especially this hard off and that
was their piecing out all the PC parts
now motherboards memory CPUs they're
testing everything and individually
selling it so there was really no deals
for sale when it came to that hard off
except something crazy happened while I
was there I've never had this happen
before
and that was there was a foreigner
another foreigner another guys Jin Dave
he walked in and tried to sell some
stuff with his wife and they gave him
like nothing for his boots and they were
gonna give him I think like cenaine for
his computer so as he was walking out I
just said how much do you want for that
PC and I he just said are there and they
offered me a thousand you know I was
like wow I took a look at it it's got an
i7 on the box so straight away I knew to
give him so I offered him around 6,000
yen and he took that straight away I
also got his number because it's always
cool to meet other foreigners in Japan
especially like if they talk they're
really friendly so ended up picking up a
deal that I've never got
before and now the roof did this next
door here we wise we'll go inside and
take a look but also Damien he ended up
getting a heap of retro stuff as well so
I guess deals are already about so here
we are now at a completely new heart off
I've never been here before so this
should be exciting to see what's going
on inside but also at that previous
place we just went to they didn't have
really any PC stuff at all it was just
retro games but on that note if you were
into reconning they had a huge selection
of stuff but with that said let's go
find ourselves some PC parts
so we just finished up at that hard off
and for PC parts it was a complete bust
I mean the best deals they had there
were GTX 680 s and GTX 770 s for around
8,000 yen they had some junk PCs which
were complete dinosaurs but one thing
that we did find there and cuz we're
into sort of retro stuff in general was
we found these cool old Sony mics the
ECM 870's and when we checked out the
condenser mic part inside that was still
in really good condition so I ended up
buying one for myself and Damien ended
up buying one for himself I also got
three DVI cables for a dollar each they
always come in handy when you're getting
monitors and people don't have DVI
cables and the last thing that Damien
ended up picking up was this cool retro
looking watch never seen it before and I
guess it was just one of those things
that you you needed but you didn't know
existed but anyway since we're on the
road we're actually outside this store
that's open 24 hours a day and they just
buy you stuff of course they sell you
stuff the store is massive we just found
this on Google Maps so we're gonna go
inside and take a look
so that last place ended up being an
absolute bastard I think they had like a
razor keyboard in their second hand for
like 8,000 yen but here we are now at
another heart off that I've never been
to before our Damien has never been here
either we're gonna go and check out what
they got inside
so we just finished up with that heart
off and it was almost the bus I found
one item in there that was really good
that was a 16 gigabyte kit of ddr3
vengence memory though the price was
mediocre it was about 7500 yen which
would be close to around 70 USD so it
was borderline just doable I just got
that deal but right around the corner
there is a PC Depot and sometimes they
can have some really good deals on used
PC parts I've never been to this PC
Depot either so it's kind of like a new
tour today
of stores that I've never been to to see
if they have deals
so now back at the original place that
I've been to a few times it was quite a
big drive because we went way out of
where we're used to going and this place
is great because you've got a PC Depot
which is just here and right next to
that you've got a heart off and they're
actually really big stores between the
both of them I usually do get deals from
either of these stores I have got a lot
of deals in the past so we're gonna go
in now and see what they've got but
before we got here as well we're on the
road and we quickly checked out a couple
of places that were both like immediate
bus one place was selling like a HD 6870
filled like $90 I knew straight away
that was a ripoff so anyway let's check
out what's inside here
so we just finished up in there it was a
complete boss there was three
motherboards that were overpriced anyway
I asked him if they had any more used PC
parts and they said no also when it
comes to filming I've actually got this
little technique now with my Sony camera
where I can start recording and then
close the lid and then no one really
knows I'm filming so I can actually get
footage inside the stores for you guys
now and people really did don't say
anything so let's check out the last
place and hopefully we can get lucky
so now we just left the last part off
and that was a complete bust
what they're doing now at least this
year compared to last year is the whole
dynamics changed they're pulling memory
out of PCs so you've only got two
gigabytes now with systems that they're
charging around ichiemon Roxann or about
150 US dollars for and then anything
more expensive is still just not worth
it I think they had a 7870 in there as
well for around about a hundred dollars
so ironically enough Tokyo ended up
being the best deals of all this time
around and I guess it starts to make
sense places like this I guess they
don't move a lot of parts so they've got
to quickly move the parts in Tokyo
because they probably get a lot of them
in so they've got to give good prices
otherwise people aren't gonna want to
buy them but anyway we did manage to get
this little guy some awesome toys he got
an indoor tap daughter which is an Indo
Raptor out of Jurassic world and also a
little Annie a toy as well so we got
these toys for him but also at the start
of the day we ended up getting a really
good deal that was just a one chance
deal I've never had that happen before
and we're gonna get home and check out
what's inside that and then of course
wrap up this pods blog hung but right
now we're gonna get you some dinner
aren't we
is now the next day and we've pulled the
PC apart that we picked up for 6000 yen
of course this was a bargain what we got
here was a HD 58 50 very old card not
really relevant for today's video games
but the rest of this package here is
really awesome 1.5 terabyte hard drive
also eh 55d motherboard with an i7 870
and also behind that is a 550 watt power
supply from delta really good stuff a
gigabytes of ddr3 memory faceplate and
also the cooler included and here we are
now at conclusion time and we got some
really good deals in total we paid over
a thousand USD for all these parts but
what we got was a gtx 980 gtx 780 also
an ex 79 motherboard three different
CPUs so we got that six core 7800 ex we
also got the 3930k and that i7 970 on
top of that we got 16 gigabytes of ram
in tokyo then we picked up an additional
16 gigabytes of ram while we're on the
road and of course that last deal that
we got the whole pc which just happened
by sheer luck i've never had that happen
i've never seen that happen before but
the person walked out after only getting
off at a thousand yen and i quickly came
in and asked him what did they offer you
what did you take and i gave him six
thousand yen and they were more than
happy to offer me that pc so i was
really happy with that awesome deal
after we pulled it all apart that was
probably the best deal in terms of the
enthusiasts tech pot the the weirdest
thing is the polarity has shifted I came
into Japan thinking that this time just
like every other time I'd be getting
those deals outside of the city but
ironically enough we got most of the
deals in Tokyo and there were really
good deals as well and I guess the logic
behind that is in Tokyo they're probably
getting dumped so many parts on them
that they have to move them so quickly
otherwise the shelf space will get
flooded and so you're going to be
getting really good deals now in my
opinion in Tokyo as opposed to the
country where they're not going to be
getting
a lot of enthusiasts tech parts through
and they know what those parts are worth
now we can see that now that they're
pulling out all the ddr3 memory and only
offering two gigabytes and systems that
are a hundred and fifty dollars plus and
I mean I think you can't even install
Windows 10 on a system with two
gigabytes I think you need four
gigabytes in total to get Windows 10 on
a system if I remember correctly but we
also got some DVI cables there are a
dollar each needed a few of those and
some really cool pickups outside of the
city was that tripod my Sony tripod is
actually pretty much at its end of life
it actually doesn't work properly now
it's had a rough life it's been a
fantastic tripod but we picked up this
velbon tripod and it's so good for 50
dollars it's easily rivaling that in my
opinion of some $200 plus tripods at
least ones that I've tried and my
opinion is better than some of those man
photos that go for $400 plus it's very
portable very quick to adjust in terms
of its height and the pan and tilt on
this thing is so fluid so that's gonna
be the new travel tripod it's awesome
the Sony I had to retire that as it's
almost broken but I'm gonna be using
that for the g7 which is on the
livestreams but I'm still gonna be using
that Sony tripod as a stationary tripod
it just won't move at all and that'll be
for live streaming but on top of that we
also got that Sony microphone and this
is one thing that I'm not an expert in
I'm not an expert in audio gear but I
think at $20 it was a good pick up
because we look at the quality it's got
two different purposes you can use it as
a live broadcasting mic or you can use
it as a dedicated mic it does have a
cardioid pattern but also if we look
inside it's just well made it's quality
and of course over the past few years
I've learned to trust my gut and when I
do I've always done well it's never let
me down so I guess that's a tip if you
guys are getting into deer hunting
whether it be PC parts hunting or if
it's some other field just trust your
gut but also on that note knowing the
prices in that market is always a big
factor in terms of just picking up a
deal on the spot and not trying to hold
out and get a better deal for instance
the tripod I knew of $50 it was solid I
might have found one for $10 cheaper but
chances are that I might have not found
one and that's exactly what happened I
didn't find a better one at a better
price so picking that up
was a good thing because we couldn't
come back and get that because it was
out of the way of where we needed to go
later that day and who guys hope you
enjoyed today's deals hunt in Japan if
you did then be sure to hit that like
button I did this over a day and a half
I spent the most of my time in Japan
with my son and we were just doing
really cool things went to the bug
Museum the dinosaur museum went into a
Jurassic world and it was just really
good to see him again
I rarely open up about my personal life
on the channel but is one of those times
and that was a real reason for coming to
Japan and things are definitely changing
for the better so you're gonna see a lot
more smiles on my face especially on the
content and yeah I've got to get back to
Australia now to leave tonight and I
gotta film the annamaya event for msy
and also film the thread Ripper review
so I'll have to get them done ASAP so
they'll probably be released before this
video which will be a little bit weird
because I'll be in astray and then it'll
seem like I'll be in Japan when I'm
actually in Japan and then headed matcha
Australia so the order will be a little
bit weird that anyway I'll catch you
guys in the OP tech video very soon he's
out for now bye so get your used PC
parts hunting capes on again and let's
see it's already going beyond beyond my
belief in in terms of how good at the
prior 747 70s which were really cool
that guy in the background he's doing
the thing as well so we just finished up
with that hard off and it was a bust and
except for one thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
