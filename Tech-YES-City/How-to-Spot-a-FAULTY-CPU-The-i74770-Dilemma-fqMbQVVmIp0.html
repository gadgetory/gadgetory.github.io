they are the heart and soul of any
computer they go into the motherboard
it's in this case the one sitting under
this nice fancy blue LED and we like to
think that they either work or they
don't work and I know in my history of
using Tec when I've been doing extreme
overclocking I have a burnt up some of
these in the past most the time having
fun however sometimes it's a very rare
case you can get a faulty CPU and in
fact it's so rare that we don't like to
think of it as a problem or really
anyone never really diagnoses it as a
problem when a computer starts
malfunctioning however in this case this
PC right here has come back to me now
the second time from a client well
should I say ex client now because and
put it this way he wasn't happy to say
the least here's the thing with this PC
I have replaced every single component
but the CPU so today we're gonna take a
look at this computer and then see
what's wrong and see how you can
identify faulty CPU if you ever come
into one
I'll go guys my computer's smoking up
it's smoking up guys you're cool I have
never seen a background like this before
so we're now on the desktop and we've
got two programs here which one of
them's called UniGene heaven benchmark
which is for the graphics card and the
others called prime95
both of these are free to download I'll
put the links in the description below
for you guys but prime95 is the one that
we're gonna focus on today this one will
test pretty much everything so if we
open up the folder and then open up the
program this will essentially allow us
to start stress testing our program so
it'll give you an option between tests
and if you go here to blend tests this
one will test everything even your RAM
and I find if there's a problem with the
computer this will usually get down to
the bottom of it relatively quickly as
opposed to I 264 which is the program
that I was usually using for testing out
CPU temperatures which that does a great
job of but sometimes in that program
problems can slip through so we're gonna
leave this running now for as long as we
can and see if the computer will crash
thousand years later so after a little
while is stress testing our computer has
completely froze nothing is responding
and if this happens this is one of the
types of errors you can get you can also
get a complete black screen as well in
my experience as seeing a critical error
86 code I believe it is that's a quick
blue screen and everything will just
restart now one thing I'm also gonna try
or actually gonna try two more things
and that is to quickly replace the
memory again because it is probably just
as likely that you could have two faulty
sets of memory as it is that you would
have a faulty CPU if that makes any
sense and we're also going to restart
the computer and go into the BIOS and do
something quickly so now we're in the
bias we can usually get here by hitting
the delete or f2 key on the keyboard as
soon as we start the machine and when
we're inside here we can quickly hit f1
that will bring up the help menu and we
should see here a setting called load
optimized defaults or load default
settings and in this case it's f5 on
this particular motherboard so we're
gonna hit f5 and we're gonna hit enter
and then we're gonna find the exit tab
and save changes in exit usually that's
f10 key if you want a shortcut the Save
Changes in the exit so we've got a
quickly interlude before we try the next
step now and that has to do with this
architecture of CPU so civically and
we'll look at that very soon but if you
do come into a problem like we saw here
today where your computer just
completely freezes doesn't even give you
a blue screen doesn't even give you
anything else like an error message or
things aren't working normally it
basically just gives you a cold hard
freeze or the system just shuts off
completely in this very rare case you
may be able to do a couple of things
still and that is if you are still in
the warranty period of the CPU and
that's usually three years so if you
bought this CPU within three years and
you have the receipt still and it's from
Intel and AMD and you can usually get it
replaced free of charge but if your CPU
is falling out of this warranty period
you're no longer covered then there are
some things you can try and that's what
we're gonna get onto now so let's get
back to
so now we're back on the desktop we can
open this program up called aida64 and
I'll put the link in the description
below for this you do get to use this
for free for 30 days and that's all
you're gonna need in this case anyway so
we'll open up this program and then
we'll go to tools and we'll go to system
stability tests and this should open up
the stress tests that were talking about
earlier in the video but this time it
will show us temperatures of the CPU now
we can also open up CPU ID and since
this architecture is one that's called
has well and this CPUs in AI 74770
was known to have temperature problems
in that they used between the heatsink
and the die they used a thing called
thermal paste instead of Sol during
these together and this did cause major
issues for a lot of people especially
overclockers who wanted to extract the
most out of their CPUs but regardless we
can see that our cooler is connected to
the CPU absolutely fine as indicated by
these temperatures on the right here
they're hovering around 30 to 40 degrees
so our cooler is connected and it is
idling okay if these temperatures are
going to a hundred degrees or really
high straightaway then you know you have
an issue with this CPU cooler not
connecting properly to the CPU so what
we're gonna do now is we're gonna load
this up we're gonna start the stress
test and we're gonna see how hot the CPU
gets after running this stress test for
a few minutes so now the CPU is
unfortunately getting very hot it's
getting close to a hundred degrees on
one of the cores it actually got to a
hundred degrees and you can tell it's
not the CPU cooler because when you
touch it it should be getting very hot
if it actually is a CPU cooler problem
in this case I can leave my hands on the
cooler it's only a little bit warm so
what we're gonna do is take this CPU
cooler off take the CPU out and then
change the paste between the dye and the
integrated heat spread up and then run
the tests again and also another thing
as well as the cable manager is
definitely not how I
member leaving this thing when it left
the studio all that time ago maybe we
have a mystery on our hands scooby-doo
it's called deleting there's only
certain CPUs you can actually do this on
the i7 4770k be one of those CPUs
so I've gotta say first impression so
far this CPU actually doesn't look too
good
they see here the thermal base is all
dried up and I'm guessing it's not doing
too good of a job in terms of
transferring heat from here to here but
regardless let's clean all this up and
put it back together
so now we've booted all up again and the
good news already is that our CPU
temperatures are much lower they seem to
be stabilizing just under seventy
degrees which is great we see actually a
max of 74 already so what we're gonna do
now however is leave this on completely
overnight and then see if it survives
but also I'm gonna still give you guys
some pointers and tips if you crash or
you come into this stage and you still
have weird problems so now if lift is on
for about eight hours and the good news
is is hovering under 80 degrees which is
really good news considering it's about
26 degrees ambient in this room at the
moment which is still very hot for 6:00
a.m. in the morning but my guess is with
this PC what happened was is that the
person who bought it they bought it
during winter in my defense so this is
the last thing I thought about was
things getting hot too quickly and when
I tested it when it left the studio is
in really good Nick because my
higher-end builds I do guarantee them
for quite a while and so this is just
one of those things where I think
something happened in those previous six
months but the good news is the CPU is
working now but we're still gonna look
at what you guys can do if you come into
a similar scenario with an older CPU so
now we're back in the BIOS and if you
guys don't remember how to get there
when you boot up your computer you hit
the delete or f2 key and here's where we
can change a few things around sometimes
in a rare case have you been using a CPU
for a very long time or you've bought a
CPU off a person who's been overclocking
it sometimes that CPU over time can
degrade and here we've got a few things
you can do in this case the test this
out the first thing to do is just to
grab the CPU core ratio here and simply
go sync all cause there should be a
setting in your motherboard if you don't
have this setting then we'll talk
another setting that you can do but what
we're gonna do is we're gonna drop this
all the way down to say 25 and it's very
low but it's going to test out if our
CPU can survive at these speeds and not
be faulty so here we can go here as well
the max CPU cache ratio which is the
same thing it say on this platform the
i7 4770k all suites so we're gonna set
them both to 25 and then another thing
if you don't have these options to
change the course speeds you can go to a
thing called CPU core voltage which is
right here on my favorites but if we've
got extreme tuna we should be able to
find it in these BIOS settings here and
I'll actually put a link to a CPU
overclocking tutorial if you guys want
to get familiar with this but here we
got CPU core voltage we're gonna change
this to one point we're gonna go I say
Intel and you get manual mode and then
type in one at 0.15 volts and now what
this is gonna do is it's going to over
volt the CPU a little bit so we've got a
combination of lowering the clock speeds
and over vaulting the CPU which this
time around we don't really need to do
this I'm just illustrating the core
voltage in case you don't have this
setting here so this will give your CPU
a little bit more power and so if it's
not running at its default speeds
because it's just very old then you can
try upping this as well and then just
Save Changes an exit and you can give
that a shot so there it is with my PC
build it was the i7 4770k I'd replaced
every single component on this build but
it wasn't in the way that I thought it
would be and so this was actually
fixable in that when I replaced the
thermal paste in between the heat
spreader and the silicon itself it did
fix the problem and I'm guessing when
the person boarded they were happy with
it for a few months and then things just
started over he
eating and this can happen is just
another problem that I'm going to have
to look out for now if I do sell pcs and
that's pretty much dee lid every Haswell
CPU that comes through here because what
Intel did with this architecture to to
add to the problems was that they put
the integrated voltage regulator on the
actual CPU itself and usually before
that they'd put it on the motherboard
and that actually added heat to the CPU
and inside things itself so I'm grateful
that my problem was fixable because the
i7 4770k PU however also my time with
dealing with pcs I have seen another two
cases of CPUs being faulty the first
other case that I dealt with was a q9
550 where in some of the computer just
suddenly switched off I'm guessing the
computer got too hot and then after that
the q9 550 never really worked the same
again in that it would have been
slightly faulty and I actually had to
get it replaced so in that case I sent
it back to the retail they sent me
another CPU out and things were all
fixed in my computer the other case that
I have seen was an i7 7700 K and this
just didn't work probably out of the box
and we did manage to over vault it and
then it did work again but the thing was
it was still under warranty so again we
sent that one back and got it replaced
so there is some weird cases that you
can come in to with the faulty CPU now
if it's definitely still covered by
warranty I employ you guys to go get it
switched over because it will give you
headaches going forward as we said
before in the intro the CPU is the main
component in any computer that doesn't
work probably everything else is not
going to work properly but unfortunately
if you are out of warranty then you can
try doing the two things that we did in
today's video so if you enjoyed this one
and be sure to hit that like button also
if you have ever come in to a faulty CPU
and you fixed it or you replaced it or
you know someone who's coming to a
faulty CPU or you're still having
problems let us know in the comments

something Star Wars II you guys have
been waiting for this video for a very
long time so if you want to see at the
moment of drops be sure to hit that sub
button turn that notification Bell on
