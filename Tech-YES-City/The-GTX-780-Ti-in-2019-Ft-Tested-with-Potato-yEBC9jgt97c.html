you want to be bowling in terms of 1080p
PC gaming then today we're going to take
a look at to use graphics cards one in
particular the 780ti now I got this in a
bargain on a use parts on I'll put the
link up here for that video if you
haven't seen it already
then we've got besides that an Rx 570
still a very popular card on the used
market to this date now these two here
this is a gtx 1650 and a 1660 which are
well above that $100 budget so let's see
how the 780ti performs in games in 2019
I've also got a little bonus for you
guys to I'm not only going to be
comparing it on a 99 hundred K but also
a 35 70 and now now a few you guys will
be like where's the r9 290x I actually
checked locally for deals and on
ebay.com and generally I can't find
these cheaper than an rx 570 and since
that uses less power and it performs
better in games I decided to leave it
out of today's comparison
and we just finished testing these for
graphics cards with the 9900 K of 5
gigahertz now of course it's a bit
unrealistic to go out and buy any of
these four cards and couple them with a
9900 came we'll be fixing that up quite
soon after we get through these
benchmarks which did show some very
interesting numbers and we'll start with
Tom Clancy's the division 2 where the RX
570 was beating the 1650 and then the
1660 was getting ahead of that sort of
as expected with those numbers and the
780 Ti was just barely beating that of
the 1650 though here's the curve ball
we're gonna throw in here and this is
Crysis 3 we're at 1080p very high
settings with SMA a set to 1x we saw
these 780ti literally beat all these
three other cards and I had to go back
and test this a few times but this is
where that older architecture that's
geared towards an older game where you
can't really optimize the game for the
newer architectures like Turing for
example the 780ti just comfortably
pulled ahead and then we had the RX 570
also giving the 1650s smackdown in this
particular title also the RX 570 did
have the best point one percent lows but
the 7h g i had the best one percent
lowest but now moving over to shadow of
the tomb Reuter we had here SMA at 1x
high setting preset and we had the 1650
beating the 780ti in this particular
title and I do believe this is optimized
for the nuturing architecture so that
was a little bit surprising to see
though since the 780ti is still a very
powerful card but it's pretty much
losing to everything rx 570 though it's
still coming ahead of the 1650 by quite
a comfortable margin then that 1660
coming in with its typical result but
now move over to Apex legends or apex
lugnut warriors as we'll put in the
title here we had the 1650 actually
coming very close to the 780 Ti then of
course rx 570 beating that and then the
GTX 1660 beating that though the 1% in
point 1 percent lows were pretty
impressive here for the rx 517 though
every other card here did run really
smoothly and then the last game on the
bench was far cry new
1080p high settings preset and then the
780ti coming with that magical number -
one of 59 FPS with a 49 min the RX 570
going up to 71 beating that at the 1650
then the 1660 beating that after rx 570
so after this initial round of testing
the results were really all over the
place with the 780 Ti it's clear that
this card with its three gigabytes of
vram and its older architecture does
tend to like older titles where all
those newer titles pretty much show that
trading blows with the 1650 although
even then on the used market the 780 Ti
is still coming well under that $150 USD
price tag but now with that aside let's
test out these four GPUs on the
old-school I 5 3rd gen Ivy Bridge and
see how the results different also on
top of that I'll do some power
consumption results for you guys then
we'll come back with the verdict
now we just finished testing things out
this time around with that third gen
Ivybridge
I 5 and what we got here with some
results that pretty much stuck similar
to the 9900 case setup in terms of where
all these cards ranked however the
differences in fps was sometimes quite
significant and then sometimes we're a
little bit smaller of course depending
on how much law we go in terms of the
general performance of the card
take for instance we go into Crysis 3
the trend still continue with the 780ti
coming out on top but it lost seven fps
on average versus the 9900 case setup
which isn't a huge deal considering the
cost of the 9900 Kay and everything else
involved in that setup versus our cheap
set up here but the one percent in point
one percent lows we're a little bit
worse on average to the RX 570 did fare
quite substantially worse too but then
the gtx 1650 actually scored the same as
it did in the previous tests on the 9900
k maybe a pretty much a decent
proposition when you couple it with
those older OEMs but moving on to the
division 2 we saw the same buck trend
continue here with minus 3 to minus 12
FPS on the 1660 where this fared the
worst in terms of losing FPS versus the
9900 case setup and I did notice the CPU
is pretty much maxed at a hundred
percent across all four of these
graphics cards tested with the older i5
may be routed shadows of the Tomb Raider
though this was a little bit of an
anomaly because the 780ti now came out
ahead of the 1650 so I don't know what
voodoo magic is going on there but this
saw the trend shift a little bit but the
other three cards the rx 570 the 1650 in
the 1660 did fare worse with the worst
case scenario being that 1660 obviously
hitting that CPU bottleneck where it did
make the FPS quite substantially lower
losing 18 average FPS overall but now
moving over to Apex dragons and I say
that because I didn't notice that the
update there done you've got these
dragons flying around now that carried
loot in the game but surprisingly enough
we did see a bit of a difference in the
trends here again just like shadows of
the Tomb Raider but this time in favor
of the rx 570 where that came ahead
by two FPS but this time that dragon was
flying around while I was doing the
benchmarks here so maybe that accounts
for something maybe it does sort of
render easier physics on the dragon
giving the RX 570 a slight boost in fps
when I tested it on this scenario but
then the 1650 scored the same fps as it
did on the 9900 K and then the 1660 and
also 780 I not losing a whole lot so
this game was as we said in the past
very well optimised in terms of CPU side
optimizations the last stop on the list
Far Cry new dawn 1080p high settings
where the 780ti fed the best here in
terms of not just performance overall
with this older OEM system but also in
terms of the FPS that lost it only lost
one fps and in the other three setups
here lost 24 on the RX 570 13 on the
1650 and 29 on the 1660 so this was the
worst case scenario of all the games but
we generally know what the Far Cry
series it is single threat heavy but it
doesn't account for the fact that the
780 Ti is not losing anywhere near the
FPS that these other three GPUs are
losing and we do know that 780 Ti hasn't
really been receiving that much driver
optimization love in 2019 but it's still
strange to see that the other three
graphics cards that are receiving driver
optimizations for these newer titles is
losing a lot of FPS when we're stepping
things down in terms of what CPU are
coupling this with maybe if you guys
know what's up in the comments let us
know because I'd like to investigate
this maybe a little bit further because
it is very eye-opening but of course the
last thing that we're looking at here is
power consumption and this is probably
the only real negative when you're
looking at a 780ti 356 Watts versus 255
on the rx 570 verse 152 on the 1650
verse is a hundred and ninety-six when
we tested this in Crysis 3 which is
generally a very power hungry game and
not just terms of GPU utilization but
also CPU utilization - CPU utilization
just take out one of the yous so now
what does this leave us with the GTX 780
t.i well basically if you can pick these
up for a good price then they're
definitely worth it in 2019 the
performance that we saw here did favor
this to be coupled with cheaper systems
which is why I like to test it with the
older i5s to see how it will fare verse
the newer graphics cards that are priced
higher on the new market of course the
rx 570 can be had for a bargain as well
if you guys have seen in the past I've
been picking those things up in droves
because they represent phenomenal price
performance the song like this shouldn't
be ignored especially if you can get it
for under a hundred US dollars the three
gigabyte vram buffer is not a problem at
1080p gaming though the power
requirements for this card will mean
that you want to couple it with a decent
power supply I'm thinking at least a
good 500 watt rated power supply should
leave you with a little bit of room to
spare that's if you couple it with an i5
3470 like we tested here today if you're
stepping it up to an overclockable CPU
then you may wish to go for something
like a 600 watt as this card here does
need to eight pin PCIe connectors and it
is one massive card weighing in at over
1.1 kilograms but on that note the
temperatures are pretty good the cooler
does a great job and when it came to
overclocking it I managed to get roughly
an extra 10 percent performance out of
this thing when I did overclock it as we
saw with the division 2 my fps went from
59 up to 64 and the 1% 0.1% lows went up
respectively and now you guys know I
love myself a good bargain and so when I
started this video and then I started
benchmarking I went looking on gumtree
and Facebook marketplace for some deals
on 780ti s and I found one person
selling two of these one being the exact
same model as this and another EVGA
model for $300 e dollars I put in an
offer of $200 e dollars and so I'm gonna
see how that goes if I could pick these
up for $100 dollars each then they're
definitely a good buy the ultimately
with the GTX 780 Ti it is a card that
can still get up and boogie in 2019
though one thing we noticed with Crysis
3 it does tend to favor older titles in
terms of the performance gains when you
compare it to the newer cards with all
those newer optimizations for those new
idols and with that said I hope you guys
enjoyed today's throwback to the 780ti

what do you think of the gtx 780 Ti is
it a card that you're still holding on
to is it a card that you've passed up
when your deal hunting or is it a card
on your radar let me know love reading
