galaxy's ex0 sea sniper which stands for
extreme overclocking sniper and it's
kind of weird since the grabbes card is
all white and I don't think snipers wear
a lot of white clothing unless they're
in the snow so Galax are taking it to
the next level for you guys so let's see
if this graphics card is indeed next
level welcome back to tokyo city this
brand karma to you guys stay with a
different kind of review not your
typical gtx 1070 review and since this
is sort of like a late release for a gtx
1070 I thought I'd do something really
different this time and since the i5 CPU
is going to hit the shelves very shortly
I figured a lot of people will want to
see how something like a simulated r5
will perform with the gtx 1070 so of
course i'm going to be taking a look at
how well this card over clocks and the
temperatures and the features but first
off i wanted to showcase how well this
combination will perform and so we've
got GTA 5 here which is the first
benchmark i'm going to do since it is a
pretty CPU intensive benchmark we feel
you've got high settings across the
board and it's looking really good like
the picture on my 1440p ultra wide is
just looking awesome and I'm even going
to enable shadow play which dips the
performance is quite a bit so we're
going to jump in this mission this is
driving through a lot of different
traffic so there's a lot of stuff going
on and I thought people might want to
see how this combination performs since
I'm pretty sure a lot of people are
going to go out there and buy an r5 6
core and a B 350 and they're probably
going to be looking for a mid-range
graphics card like the GTX 1017 they're
going to be like hey I'm a bowl and this
is how my rig performs and so we see
here the overclocks are really good
already we're getting like 2.1 gigahertz
and the temperatures are pretty low and
this is on a custom fan profile so the
Galax is performing pretty well but also
the six core 12 threaded Rison is
performing really well soon and we'll
benchmark a few other games but I just
wanted to show me driving through all
this try
pick now the next game we've got up here
is Sniper Elite 4 which is a game based
on just yes knifing things and being
hidden in the shadows kind of thing you
can do a bit of melee skirmish which
I'll try and get onto but this is
running at high settings again at 1440p
ultra wide we see that's getting some
really good frame rates not really
clipping a hundred Hertz which is a more
powerful grab squabbles ooh but
definitely not bad for a gtx 1070 i mean
it's really good this thing is running
really smoothly i guess you can agree
that this is a really good combination
I'm just about to snipe this guy here
boom headshot baby lack of bowls hey
guys I'm over here colors blonde and
sees the framerate to do okay what looks
like some serious aim-assist there the
gums just pointing down looks pretty
cool good so yep Sniper Elite gtx 1070
and a simulated r56 core running really
well so here's the next game here Ghost
Recon wildlands now I've got this at
14:40 filter white again with the
graphics settings set to medium and just
on the medium preset and honestly the
graphics look really good at medium I
kind of don't understand what's going on
with this game doesn't at medium it
doesn't look a whole lot different to
very high you see here the frames are on
about 62 or 60 fps constantly and this
is one of the most graphically demanding
titles so I'll just wait for the boys to
jump in the car here and then we'll go
for a little spin and see how this
graphics card performs even like during
intense moments there was dipping down
to around 50 something FPS so it's good
doing pretty good I don't know this come
on boys start firing the guns so see
it's performing really well the CPUs
handling it and the GPUs handling this
game absolutely fine so the last game
we've got here is Mirror's Edge catalyst
which is kind of like a parkour game you
can see here it's running the game a
pretty decent frame rates over 60 FPS
this is on high settings as well the
visual quality looks absolutely amazing
on the settings alright so we got our
first fight here this guy's looking like
he's ready for a little rumble I am
bringing
bring it on I'll leave this look at that
go man see the Beast
Oh
so there it is guys the gtx 1070 EXO c
sniper from gal axe and I think they've
outdone themselves with this grave scar
because what I've got here performed
really well the over clocks are really
good I got to like 2.1 gigahertz on the
core there also the memory got an extra
350 megahertz on that and it all did
this with really low temperatures I was
getting 62 degrees temperatures maximum
in heaven after a 30 minute benchmark
with 26 degree ambient temperatures now
keep in mind this was on a custom fan
profile which did get a little bit
noisier than the stock fan profile which
was extremely quiet and the overclock
fan profile the aggressive fan profile
was still not that noisy at all as you
probably heard with the previous noise
test but even if you don't want to
overclock at all this graphics card
managed to get up to 2 gigahertz on the
core out of the box so if you're not
into overclocking and you want something
that's really quiet and it's going to
perform really well then this graphics
card will do that and now looking on to
the cosmedix of this cardem for this
part of actually installed it in the
back here and it looks really nice in a
black and white theme builder if you
want to go with a white and blue or
white red theme build then this is where
this card will really kick in because
medics are really nice you've got the
white shroud there and also the white
backplate and then you've got the RGB
LED lighting that doesn't have a rainbow
effect but in the software you can
change it to a static effect color of
your choosing and so this will fit in
really nicely with any white plus your
favorite color theme to build those for
the software itself it was pretty good
though I still prefer to use afterburner
personally though you will have to use
the gallic software if you wish to
change the colors of the RGB LED
lighting which out of the factory comes
with a white effect being a white
graphics card and you can see it in the
background here it does look pretty dank
now for some last-minute things with
this graphics card you do have three
DisplayPort outs one DVI and one HDMI
out to go with that for a total of five
outputs and also the card itself
requires an 8 plus 6 pin configuration
therefore the PCIe connections and of
course there's the price factor if
you're in Australia this card comes in
at around
569 Australian dollars or at least
that's the cheapest I could find it for
online which is actually only 20 AUD
more expensive than the cheapest gtx
1070 out there so at that price it's
actually a really good buy considering
you go to cosmetics and the performance
to go with this 1070 though if you're in
America I think the cheapest I could
find it for was four hundred and seventy
USD so it is a fair bit more if you are
in the US so if you are not then it's a
really good buy for a 1070 and I can
recommend it at its current prices
though also if you are looking to buy an
r5 CPU and coupled with the 1070 and I
think today's results speak for
themselves great combo I look forward to
giving you guys a build with the parts
that I used today or at least a
simulated part and the other parts and
without said I'm going to get on out of
here guys so let me know in the comment
section below what you think of the exo
C sniper from gal axe I really like the
look of this card I wish they had a 1080
TI variant of this because I would
really want to put that in this
workstation ASAP because I think it
looks pretty good well at least it looks
a lot better than the 1080 TI Exelero
that I did the custom job so I'll catch
you guys in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
