flight in like eight hours and I've got
a dismantle all this here because I've
been like editing videos the last few
days and I've been indistinct it's been
hectic it's been crazy so we're gonna
get all this done welcome back to take
your cities Brian I'm a to you guys
today with a vlog of all the stuff I
have to do here so I got a dismantle
this whole PC because I just finished
doing a video last night with this PC
this is the build here where this is
gonna be the band-aid PC it's gonna
serve as a short temporary fix while I'm
back in Japan for a stint here where
I've got to finish up my job so that's
right I will be finishing on my job in
Japan and I will be coming back down
under for good brothers to hit up the LG
tech scene and see what we can do you
know hopefully make things awesome and
whatnot so are we dismantling this bad
boy here we're gonna be leaving this
case behind and we're also gonna be
putting these monitors in a box and
trying to ship them off home so let's
get on with that
okay so we've done that pi then we've
got all the drives out we just go to
dismantle the actual hardware now but
before we do that we're gonna move that
over to this table over here I've got
some things on here that I haven't quite
yet finished with this is the Azeroth
fatality x99 board I was gonna review
but I came into two problems actually
and a message has work about them and if
they can't fix that I'm gonna have to
release a negative absolutely the 7852
got off any gold raided the house while
things are pretty awesome that is
another project I'm doing as well it's a
hundred dollar laptop so you're gonna
see that and see how well it can
benchmark and whatnot so let's get all
this stuff off the table so we can get
surgery started on a juniper
time for a drive
so on the Khans home now and they've got
like these backpacks but like literally
you know I can probably fit like a
couple of shoes in there and that's
about it so I'm looking for something a
little bit bigger than that so we'd have
to go to another place now called Don
Quixote
all right sir at the backpack section
look at this and then look $60 almost
and made in Vietnam like damn alright so
we're here now at the $10 bag section
this is more my price and we see here
this thing can be made anywhere in the
world I really care for that price so
we're actually gonna grab this one here
it's like a fit pal supplies in here and
all the rest of the goodness so we're
gonna get this and then get the other
bag already packed up and we're good to
go
all right so we got the monitors on the
beds we're gonna have to pack these and
so you got the phone here and stuff but
I've gotta like hack it off actually so
we've got the actual bags packed now so
that even though that looks small it's
gonna melt like seriously like about ten
kilo and it's this one he's probably
gonna be the same yeah yeah right so we
finished packing this box it's got like
twenty three and a half kilo in it in
that suitcase over there which is about
twenty kilo so we have to drop a little
bit of weight off that and we're gonna
pull this mess all right we are at the
airport here lads and it is absolutely
crazy I mean
I just managed to get here with like a
couple of minutes to spare and you know
like I had to pack and just get to this
place where they take you to the airport
so you park your car there you take all
your luggage with you and then you don't
have to pay train tickets and tax and so
it's actually pretty cheap like fifty
dollars party card for like a month so
here we are here at the airport now and
it's a pretty damn crazy light I mean
the queue for this plane this is like a
full plane so I managed to get all that
luggage on and then some
so they actually let me on with a little
bit of extra luggage which is kind of
weird if a jet started to do that bit
anyway we're about to board now so I
just managed to get here and I got a
problem where I had to put like a
battery out of my box and then put it in
my bag there so everything is all good
to go and we're ready to board this
plane so let's get the on earth you
get on
we got everything through the whole
studio is up and we're gonna set this
thing up in Dawn's and here's the
beautiful Gulf Coast but it's really
early in the morning so I will try and
get one for you guys
and it's really noisy in here so let's
get out of here alright so we are back
in Oz at the place I've unpacked all my
stuff and I've also crashed out for a
few hours because I just couldn't sleep
on the plane but we got all that stuff
down there we've got also all that stuff
and stuff on the couch
I've been fixing up these lights here
and I'm gonna have to be using this
whole area at the monitors there so I
super test them out they could be broken
like just stop everywhere we're gonna
pick stuff up I also did get that 980ti
that I was talked about in the Aussie
deals so that's rocked up I've also got
a crucial MX 300 of a review for you
guys and we got this here this is gonna
be probably get a separate video on Sun
even YouTube play button and then
there's the razor advanced pattern the
mouse love that stuff so guys this is
gonna be the new studio there's my dad
we call it dad man we're we're gonna be
getting this this is we have to turn
this into like the whole new setup I
don't know it's kind of crazy because I
got a lot of work to do here
so I need this little corner here to
work with but should be okay all right
so the a Tron vision survived the plane
ride now we're gonna test the 4k monitor
and the ace of 4k monitor is working to
sir
that's awesome means we can start
getting a new desk as well and a new
monitor stand and we can start making
the new down under setup man this is so
freaky though I just got home and like I
don't know why my dad just pulled all
these C CFL bulbs out and I'm gonna need
them for my studio light so that was
just really freaky and really cool at
the same time so actually still gonna
test these out and make sure they don't
make noise as well because if they're
making noise and
using it's weird some light bulbs
actually make noise I don't know why
that is so
anyway they should work and we should be
able to get the studio set up ASAP so
we're just testing out these lights that
my dad gave me and they're all good to
go except they are the orange white
balance so I'm gonna have to try filming
with it and see how it goes
should look good anyway anyway guys if
you like this video you know hit that
like button and I will catch you guys in
another tech video very soon and yeah I
guess we're down under from here on in
and we're gonna be making a lot more
tech videos for you guys and my voice is
probably a little bit different because
I got something like sniffling going on
stuff the one on like button subscribe
if you haven't already more tech videos
a lot more tech videos coming for you
guys from here on in peace out for now
goodbye
oh yeah just be careful one thing where
you'll trick some of this gear and they
put on the Internet to try phone off
it'll be you'll be missing out but in a
bit a week</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
