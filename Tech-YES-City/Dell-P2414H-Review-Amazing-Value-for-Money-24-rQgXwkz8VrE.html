new monitor and when I saw the Delpy
two-for-one 4h on sale for $180 I
thought wow I've got to get this thing
and then I read a review on EFT central
about how good it was I thought this is
the absolute best bargain of a lifetime
however when I got the monitor in and I
ran it through its paces there was one
problem that really is going to hold me
back from recommending this monitor so
let's find out what it is
so my history with monitors is not too
complicated
I'm very value for money orientated when
it comes to buying a monitor and I
currently own a 27-inch Korean panel
which over a year has been serving the
purposes as being a main desktop monitor
very well
however least recently I've been in the
market for a new monitor especially as a
backdrop monitor and a monitor for doing
tutorials for you guys and so therefore
it has to have anti-glare properties or
a good AG coating and that's when I
pulled the del out of the box I
immediately noticed that the anti-glare
coating on this monitor is very good
does a fantastic job of blocking out
pretty much all reflections not only
that the bezel around it is also really
good as well it doesn't reflect any
light as well it's a nice matte black
that is just non reflective pretty much
also the OSD the buttons everything on
this monitor was very good until I
noticed one big problem and you guys
probably want to know what that is so
we'll get straight on to it and it's a
thing called cross-hatching and I didn't
even know what this problem was until I
got this monitor and I'm before we get
into this review I'm going to say that
it could just be limited to my sample
I'm not too sure but it's going to be
the main reason what's the only reason
why I'm going to be returning this
monitor because for me I'm just getting
OCD about it and it's becoming
unbearable especially when I compare it
side-by-side to the 27-inch Korean
battle which is just absolutely gorgeous
so what exactly is cross-hatching well I
actually fully don't understand what it
is yet there's not a lot of articles out
there to explain what it is but in my
understanding I think of it as pretty
much stitching behind your picture and
in this case when I have an hour orange
backdrop it feels like someone's put
like a green stitched linen cloth behind
it and it's very annoying so anyway I'll
quickly show you guys what the problem
looks like with my camera even though
I'm not sure if it'll pick it up fully
so for this test I'm going to run the
monitor at three different refresh rates
with everything else in this room being
static so the lighting the camera
position and so what this means is if
you can't pick it up on the camera
you'll compare the images the three
images side-by-side and if there's a
difference then that essentially means
there's a difference on the monitors
side of things so now this is the first
issue here this is 60 Hertz
is that I can see this sort of sort of
like this these slight green lines is
faint green lines behind the orange
image and if I do that on my Korean
panel they just go away like they're not
there on the Korean panel and so it
means this is this problem is inherent
to this panel and the funny thing is is
if you overclock this monitor to 75
Hertz so if I put the refresh rate up to
75 Hertz then you'll see that
essentially it's just like it just gets
worse it's unbearable at 75 Hertz I mean
I can clearly notice this
cross-stitching issue at 75 Hertz though
the ironic thing is is if we down clock
this monitor so if we go to the refresh
rate and we down clock it to 45 Hertz
then the cross-hatching issue is just
completely goes away like it's not even
there so this is how the monitor should
be at 60 Hertz in my opinion and so I
don't know I think maybe something in my
monitors being overworked and I don't
know if this affects every other p24 one
for H but anyway let's get back to the
review
so I'm not too sure if this
cross-hatching problem is just limited
to my monitor it may affect other Dell
monitors I'm not too sure and I'm
honestly not willing to try though if
you do get a Dell monitor and it doesn't
have a cross hatching problem then I can
say that it's a fantastic monitor I mean
the input lag was extremely low when I
tested it against the Korean panel it
beat that on both the DVI ports when I
tested it against the Acer pata across
both DVI ports it beat that as well so
it was extremely good in terms of input
lag extremely low also the response
rates for an IPS panel man it was more
responsive than my Korean panel and this
is a great thing for gamers so for
gamers looking for an IPS panel this
thing is a win especially at a low price
point so I'm kind of left in a sort of a
dilemma where I wish this problem of
cross-hatching never existed but looking
at the monitor itself with the build
quality what you're getting here is
actually a pretty well built monitor
that's also actually lightweight I'll
surprised l have really nailed it when
it comes to the build quality I love the
bezel I love that it's this plastic it's
lightweight but it's still sturdy and
everything doesn't feel cheap at all it
feels really good on this monitor the
anti-glare coating that is pretty good
as well I'll surprised I mean it just
blocks out pretty much all the line when
I was showing you guys the BIOS shots in
my vlog I thought wow that's actually
some of the best picture I've got from a
monitor on my camera in my life so I was
really pleased with that so if the
connectivity del has done a pretty good
job here as well you get a display port
and a VGA port which the cables for
those are included with the monitor and
you also get a DVID port which the cable
wasn't included though you do get a DVID
adapter I believe also there is a power
cable included and there's also three
USB 2 ports as well so connectivity is
pretty good on this monitor though you
don't have an HDMI port so that's learn
to keep in mind the on-screen display on
this monitor as well as actually pretty
good there's lots of options to choose
from you've also got you can change the
colors you can change the contrast you
can change the brightness you can set it
whether it can automatically swivel or
not and you can also choose from a
different range of presets there which
are actually
good I found warm to be the closest to a
balanced picture in my opinion out of
the colors though the standard was
actually pretty good for gaming I
actually preferred the standard profile
picture to the actual gaming profile
picture and all these selections don't
make a difference to input lag as well
so that's something to keep in mind also
there's the option to select which input
you like or you can just leave it to
Auto which works fine as well the
monitor also has an automatic power
savings feature which will power down
the monitor if it's not in use as well
so then there's the mounting options the
standard they include is quite frankly
really good I was surprised it's
lightweight and it also allows you to
adjust the height you can adjust the
swivel and you can adjust the tilt so
it's a three-way adjustable stand and it
does a fantastic job without making any
noises and being easy to use also if you
want to mount this via the VESA mounting
you can do that as I've done this with
here it's got the four screw holes which
will just pretty much make it a breeze
to mount on because it's a lightweight
monitor and so I've got it actually
mounted to a monitor stand at the moment
and it's really good so in conclusion
what can I say about the del P 2 4 1 4 H
well I'm quite sad because if this
cross-hatching problem didn't exist I
would be a very happy customer I'd be
over the moon I think it's a fantastic
monitor just besides the cross-hatching
issue
I love the anti glare properties and I'm
usually not an anti glare guy I'm
usually a big fan of gloss and this anti
glare is so good I'm really impressed
with it does a great job of blocking out
light but still keeping still giving out
a good picture so del have done a good
job there they've done a good job at the
build quality I think it's a great
on the dot they've done a good job with
the actual panel implementation in the
response times the input layers
extremely low and for an IPS panel it's
got some really good response times so
kudos the dell for getting that right
though there's just one problem and
that's the cross-hatching and I don't
know why this exists but I'm willing to
bet that something in the monitor is
being overworked at the native spec
because when I down clocked it to 45
Hertz the problem didn't exist and so
I'm going to not recommend this monitor
unless you can get verified that it
doesn't have this cross-hatching problem
if you can verify that doesn't have the
cross-hatching problem before you buy it
then that can highly recommend this
monitor as it's a great balance monitor
for gaming for doing tutorials for
having as a backdrop whatnot it's such a
fantastic balance 1080p monitor and a 24
inch I think it's a great sweet spot if
you're just sitting at a desk playing a
lot of MOBA games playing a lot of RTS
games as well and so I find 27 inch kind
of to be a bit too big especially for
mobile on a desk so anyway that's my
review of the Dell p2 for H a P 2 for 1
for H if you have any questions or
comments about this model then please
drop a comment in the comment section
below though unfortunately I will be
returning this monitor and I don't think
I'll be trying my luck again as I will
just rather buy a trusty Korean monitor
so anyways that's it from me today if
you have any questions about the Dell P
2 for 1 for H then drop a comment in the
comment section below and if you haven't
read then hit that like button and
subscribe to tech yes sit MMA and I will
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon oh yeah and there's also the
facebook and twitter and also patron
links there if you want to support the
channel and keep it sponsor free anyway
guys I'll catch you in another tech
video very shortly peace out for now bye
however I'm just going to go test it
right now and see if it does block out
or does reduce the blue light coming out
of the monitor and the good thing about
this test is even though it's like
ghetto science it will give you accurate
results as we see here because the
camera is on the exact same exposure</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
