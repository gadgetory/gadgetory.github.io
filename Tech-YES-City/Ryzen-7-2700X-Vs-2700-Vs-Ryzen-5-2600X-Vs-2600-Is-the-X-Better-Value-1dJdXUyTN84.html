second-generation rise in processes they
have changed things up a little bit
especially compared to the 1000 series
where if you bought the 1800 X you are
paying a considerable amount more money
than the risin 7 1700 and in fact the
last generation of rising CPUs
all's I was recommending with a non
excuse that is the ones that came in a
lot cheaper and often in my opinion the
best value for money however this time
around you've got the flagship coming in
at 329 retail followed by a $30 discount
for the Rison 720 700 now between those
thirty dollars you get a much better
cooler on the 2700 X this is the RGB
Wraith prism cooler not only does it
look better and actually performs pretty
well enabling you to get over 4
gigahertz on all eight cores with the
included cooler which does represent
very good money out of the box the 2700
however you guys did point me up in a
previous video and it does have a big
purpose and that is because the TDP is
lower it can actually out of the box run
a lot better especially in mini ITX
configurations so I will pull up some
numbers here for you guys you can see
the power consumption figures both out
of the wall are a lot lower for the 2700
versus the 2700 X even the 2600 comes in
with a significant amount less power
draw than the 2600 X so in my opinion
this is what makes the 2 non X variants
very viable this time around
therefore that person who wants to put
it in a new small form-factor build and
they don't want much power draw and they
do want to keep the efficiency as high
as possible because in a mini ITX PC you
will get a situation where the VRMs
might not be that good on a mini ITX
motherboard but also the air flow could
be stuffy in general so it does make
sense sometimes to not always overclock
your CV used and if you need to save
that $30.00 in both cases then you can
get that with the non ex variants
so today's video is going to be a little
bit different in that I'm testing all
these CPUs with their included stock
coolers as I believe this time around
it's much more relevant for someone who
wants to buy one of these CPUs and see
how it performs out of the box because
if you know how to overclock or on the
other note if you know how to under
vault and under clock then they're
really the both the eight cores are
going to do the exact same thing and
same with the six cause however out of
the box they do come wide a little bit
differently when we pull up the
Cinebench scores we can see that the six
core the 2600 did come in with an all
core score of twelve hundred and thirty
seven CB the single threaded score went
up to one hundred fifty eight CB as
opposed to the X variant which went up
to thirteen hundred eleven and 169 on a
single core they're moving over to the
eight cores we can see that the 2700
came in with an impressive fourteen
hundred and seventy nine CB and on the
single core it did score the lowest of
all four CPUs coming in with 143 points
moving over to the X variant this scored
one hundred and sixty-nine on single
threaded scores and also a
multi-threaded score at sixteen hundred
and eighty-one though as I mentioned
before the power consumption was a
significant amount more on the twenty
seven hundred X both from the wall and
both in the inbuilt sensors then it was
to the twenty seven hundred of course
what about clock speeds in regards to
all these four CPUs well this is where
things get a little bit weird because
the clock speeds at least from my
testing here we're jumping up and down
and they usually sat within a 100
megahertz range the most they saw out of
a single core was the 2600 X and also
the 2700 X coming in with similar of 4.0
five to four point one five gigahertz
however it was important to note that
this was jumping and bouncing between
different cores and when it came to the
gaming benchmarks I did notice that they
all scored pretty similar
however the 2600 X did edge out all
these other four CPUs so if it's one
thing if you are on a budget and you are
a gamer and you don't want to overclock
and you want to go with AMD CPU lineup
then the 2600 X may be the best choice
for you
also with the memory I did lock in ddr4
Ram profiles because if I didn't there
was some insane stuttering this was
testing with a GTX 1080 ti2 so one thing
you will want to do with AMD Seabee
use is get some decent memory with solid
XMP profiles or if you know how to
overclock memory you will definitely
want to do that to get the best results
especially when it comes to gaming now
going back to the clock speeds out of
the box
XO file boost technology does do a good
job even with the included coolers if
you want to put on something like an
enthusiast cooler like a h1 10 from
Corsair then you can expect slightly
higher performance especially with the
2700 X which uses the most power out of
these 4 CPUs I did see up to four point
zero five gigahertz Auto boosting on all
cores with a h1 10 I however when it
came to temperatures with these CPUs you
could see that the 2600 even with its
lowest clock speeds here whilst
performing the worst that Wraith stealth
cooler in my opinion just isn't fit for
the job it's more appropriate for a fork
or even a fork or eight threaded CPU
from AMD but with the six core 12 thread
you can't really expect or at least you
shouldn't be expecting too much in terms
of overclocking with the race itself
comes in just over 300 grams as opposed
to the 2700 X which is coming over half
a kilogram and then these other two
variants here the race spire and you do
get the race spot led with the 2700
they're coming in close to 400 grams so
if it's one thing to say about the 2600
I do believe it's really only good for
out-of-the-box speeds if you want to
overclock on this thing then I'd
recommend getting a new cooler even it'd
be a thirty dollar budget cool a master
212 for example so now the last part of
this video was where I went to Twitter
and as I was benchmarking these CPUs I
asked you guys if you wanted to see any
tests in particular and the first
request was a be 350 motherboard tested
out so I did test out the 2700 X on the
b3b motherboard there was no problems
running this CPU had boosted up
absolutely fine
the ddr4 memory as well that overclocked
to the exact same levels and in fact I
could even get some HyperX stuff which
was 21 33 megahertz even with the XMP
profiles I got that up to 3200 mega
that's on a be 350 motherboard so it
depends on the be 350 motherboard but
some of them may be bad they may just
need a BIOS update to work properly or
at least work at 100% but some at least
like the gigabyte model they do work
really well especially with the latest
bios with
the AMD rise in second generation CPUs
the next question I got asked of course
was test out memory overclocking I was
able to get thirty six hundred megahertz
on the g.skill Sniper stuff and on the
HyperX stuff I went up to thirty-two
hundred megahertz keep in mind I did
have to relax the timings quite a bit
but it does go to show that these second
generation of CPUs does have a better
integrated memory controller especially
compared to the previous generation of
Verizon first-generation CPUs and then
besides some other bizarre requests I
did get asked about gaming benchmarks so
I did include a couple of games for you
guys csgo and also Final Fantasy 15 this
just gave us some numbers that I really
wanted to see and nothing was really out
of the ordinary here the 2600 x out of
the box with the gtx 980ti in my opinion
was performing the best out of these
four CPUs and you probably wondering why
is the 2600 X beating the 2700 X at
least in csgo I believe it's got to do
with the level 3 cache this has more
dedicated to 6 cores as opposed to this
having the same amount dedicated to 8
cores and of course csgo doesn't really
take advantage of all those 8 cores 16
threads perfectly and then move ahead of
Final Fantasy 15 there was some pretty
bad point 1 percent low results here but
I do believe that has to do more so with
the GPU because I was doing this at
Ultra white I wasn't actually testing it
at 1440p it was like 1440p ultra wide so
was even that much more stressful than a
1440p benchmark but the numbers were
pretty similar in that benchmark itself
so if you're going to go one CPU to the
other and you're going for high
resolution gaming it wouldn't make that
much of a difference at all though for
your competitive gaming you want to go
with something from AMD than the 2600 X
is probably your best bet though when it
all comes down to it this time around
the second generation rise and CPUs all
have their purpose to exist the value
for money really isn't changing a whole
lot between the X and the non X this
time around and in fact if all you want
to do is get a motherboard some decent
ddr4 memory and play games then I'd
recommend the 2600 X or if you're doing
content creation and you don't want to
overclock then I'd recommend the 2700 X
though if you're going for a mini ITX
solution and you want to keep the power
consumption down then both the 2600 and
the
20700 will serve you well so that extra
$30 it's not a whole big difference this
time around and in fact the 2700 X would
be my best pick this time around with
that Wraith prism cooler but if you're
just gaming and you want the best
performance out of the box from AMD CPUs
then I'd pick the rising 520 600 X so
this time around I would personally
probably pick these three CPUs out of
the bunch I think the 2600 it's kind of
a little bit overshadowed by these three
this time around and you guys that's
about it for me today if you enjoyed
this video - be sure to hit that like
button and let me know in the comment
section below which of these CPUs do you
think is the best this time around and
why love reading your thoughts and
opinions as always or if you have any
questions of course ters drop them in
the comment section below and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can
peace out for now bye
though when it all boils down to it I
just got to change up the a TRO a bit a
little bit boils down while we gotta do
what we gotta say what we gotta do
moving over to the Ecole variants we had
go back to the overclocks at hand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
