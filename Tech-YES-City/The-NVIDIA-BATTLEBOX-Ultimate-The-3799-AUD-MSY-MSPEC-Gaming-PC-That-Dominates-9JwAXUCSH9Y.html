me here we have the Nvidia battle box
and now in video are collaborating with
different computer retailers across
Australia New Zealand to bring out a
series of computers that gamers can go
and purchase and then have absolutely no
problems with and beside me here I have
the ultimate series and it's a
collaboration between nvidia and ms why
this is called their M spec gaming PC
and now we will get something out of the
way this is a premium product that is
coming into the premium price it's three
thousand seven hundred and ninety-nine
strand dolls so it is very expensive
especially if you're used to watching
some of the budget builds and the hustle
builds that I put together here on the
channel this one here is coming in a lot
more expensive but if you're looking for
the absolute best then this thing does
have it all inside we've got an Intel i7
8700 K which is practically the best CPU
you can get out there for gaming and
even some people doing productivity but
also with that is cooled by the corsair
h 100 a v2 cooler you've got 16
gigabytes of RGB ddr4 memory it's clock
to 3466 mega that's effective and it's
powered by the RM 1000 I'd pounce play
so it's packed with absolute quality in
terms of parts for the SSD you get a
Samsung 850 m2 Evo series and also be
the backup drive you get a 2 terabyte
Seagate Barracuda 7200 rpm and with that
all this comes housed in an in win 303
RGB Tower and there's also a three pack
of Aurora in win fans included on the
azouz Strix f mother would now if taking
a look at the zoo Strix Erie cently on
the channel and I'll put a link in the
description below for that but this is a
similar thing - Wireless so it's a very
strong motherboard especially for
overclocking it also has some decent
auto overclocking features and lastly
for this build we've got the most
important piece of the puzzle this is
the 1080 TI ROG Strix grabs card now if
you guys have watched a few videos in
the past you'll know that the Strix is
one of the best tricks is out there in
terms of graphical performance but also
with that this card went to 72 degrees
maximum and an overclocked very
aggressively out of the box we're
talking near 2 gigahertz without doing
anything at all so if you're one of
those gamers who doesn't like to
overclock and just wants to get
everything working perfectly then this
grams card and also the 8700 K is going
to give you one amazing
experience and with that said let's take
a look at some benchmarks so first up we
had Destiny's turn if you guys are into
high refresh rate monitors 1080p gaming
experience this thing on max settings
maxed all those sliders 200 FPS
constantly I didn't see a dip below 200
at any time absolutely incredible
performance moving up to 4k we're
getting over 65 fps a lot of the times
when we overclocked it we did get a
about 71 FPS so there was a slight
increase though there wasn't much at all
to be honest we were able to pub gee I
like to play this game on high with very
low foilage and at 1080p
I removed the frame cap which you guys
have been requesting that I do in the
past and here we had average FPS going
into the 150 mark and 0.1% low and not
even going below a hundred so this was
incredible performance at 1080p and then
going up to 4k we managed to get over 50
fps a lot of the times so it was a very
good experience though if you do want to
go up to 4k Ultra I don't even think the
Titan V would be capable of handling
this game at 4k at 60fps
though the performance numbers were
really good highs where I prefer to have
my settings at but you do have the
option to go ultra you just have to drop
the resolution a little bit and then the
next game I decided to test was
overwatch we put this on ultra settings
and I decided to go into a jam action
packed scene with 6 Road hogs on both
sides and then me being a bastion and
just firing away and mowing things down
and we're getting over 200 FPS
practically all the time here average of
221 maximum of 300 FPS on this game
moving up to 4k it was constantly over a
hundred FPS well the dip dip down
slightly below 100 but for what it's
worth it is a great experience in 4k and
if you want those high refresh rate
monitors at 1080p this battle box will
provide that but what about the latest
Call of Duty World War 2 which is very
intensive on both the CPU and the GPU
and here we just had amazing frame rates
and of course you do get the occasional
hacker that does pop up on PC but
besides that it is a very enjoyable
experience especially on the battle box
with over 200 FPS at 1080p on high
settings the point 1% loads were amazing
- very smooth experience stepping it up
to 4k we had a hundred and forty average
fps and then 145 overclocked so this was
very good at both 4k
and 1080p so a rig like this will
ultimately serve your needs if you want
to play at 21 by 9 ultra wine 1440p
hundred Hertz for example or if you want
to play on a 240 Hertz monitor at 1080p
or if you want to play at 40k 60 Hertz
as well then this machine is geared up
towards it now with the overclocking as
I said before I didn't manage to squeeze
much more performance out of the box
with this thing the graphics card went
up around an extra 60 megahertz on the
core the memory wasn't that high as well
the Strix rog graphics card is
overclocked aggressively out of the box
and so it is very quiet it is a great
solution for people who don't like
overclocking and while the best
performance without having to tink or
anything the words for the CPU this ran
really well out of the box so you
generally don't need to overclock this
for gaming unless you're going for the
app most best competitive FPS and of
course with that I did manage to get it
to 4.80 Hertz this is without a deal it
as well and now with this PC I did
manage to tally up the prices of all the
parts individually and shipped to your
door it cost around 3700 of strand dolls
to build this thing yourself
so msy are charging about $100 premium
to build it and also provide that
two-year return to base warranty which
is actually pretty good if you want a
premium product of course at a premium
price if you're used to watching some of
my other builds on the channel you'll
know that this is a build that's sort of
in a different league in both price and
performance to what we're used to
building here on the channel but it is
one quality product I have taken it
through its paces and I did like what I
saw in Olli the performance really good
but the noise is really low and it's
just jam-packed with quality parts
there's not one part in here that I
don't think would underperform anyway
guys that's about it for today's battle
box PC I hope you enjoyed this video if
you did then be sure to drop a comment
in the comment section below also leave
the link for this PC in the description
below msy do have around about 14 m spec
pcs in total where they build them with
good quality components and then of
course they have a price point to match
your budget if you are not into building
pcs yourself be personally I love
building and tinkering and then
overclocking the pcs but of course if
you're new to PC gaming and something
like this is enthusiast based
and it will serve you really well if
you're into either 1080p high refresh
rate gaming 1440p ultra wide gaming or
4k gaming on high settings or even ultra
settings depending on the game and with
that I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
