headphones headsets these are things
that can be so important but in 2019
there is also so much fluff out there
and marketing jargon me personally I put
this stuff through its paces and if it
ends up going through the paces and I
like it then it stays on the desk and
right here from Oris I've got their m2
and m5 gaming mice and the thing is they
asked me to take a look at it because
they sent I think some might send a
rocket jump and he thought it wasn't
even worthy of plugging in but a good
old tech yes I like to give something a
chance and they were really saying look
we're so impressed with this stuff we
really want you to take a look at it so
we're gonna take a look at these new
mice as well as their new keyboards the
k7 and k9 and their headset the h5 and
just give it to you guys straight and
let you know if Oris should be a serious
consideration if you're looking for
peripherals
the first thing we're gonna look at are
the gaming mice these are easily the
most important peripheral that you
should be considering these are
seriously make and break when it comes
to doing things from my instance doing
video editing 4k video I need something
that's accurate fast and I can snap
quickly with a fingertip grip if you're
an FPS player then palm grip mice
usually gain popularity here for being
able to get pinpoint accuracy so you
need to have the goods in these mice
ready to go so here in the studio I
currently mainly use Logitech mice I've
got a G 402 for FPS games and then when
I use my video editing and also RTS and
mobile I use a G 203 I think in a
straight it's called the G 100 - they're
both fingertip or palm grip mice so
after using the Auris m2 we're gonna get
straight into the details this is such a
love and hate not love or hate it's love
and hate relationship with this mouse
because there's things that they've done
so well for starters of ways an 80 grams
vs. 86 on the G 102 so the weight is
really good I'm not gonna say one is
better than the other I like using both
these mice these switches they've used
Omron all around so it does have a very
high actuation point which is great for
gaming they've also got an ambidextrous
design with two buttons on the left two
buttons on the right and the positioning
of the buttons is really good the scroll
wheel is actually very nice however it
is a little bit loose to the point where
if you wanted to reliably use this
middle click as a button you'd cause
yourself slipping up and down with a
scroll wheel dpi change has four levels
and the feet are solid on a soft style
mouse pad and the cable itself is very
lightweight it's not going to get in the
way of anything you do and it has a
picsArt PA 3327 sensor and the best
thing yet is it comes in at $39 dollars
or in the US 30 USD so it's very well
positioned against the Logitech G 102
however besides the good points
the baddest point about this mouse is
the software it just lets it down so
much and it's not a problem like if
you're gonna go out and get a gaming
mouse and just play games this thing is
gonna be excellent the movie into the
software there's things like
I pose that apparent there's four levels
of dpi that you can't even take off any
of those levels of dpi I personally only
like having two levels of dpi one for
very slow like sniping and fps another
for 900 this is the sweet spot on this
Mouse I have 900 DPI - they feel very
similar however I did notice with the
picsArt sensor itself there is a slight
amount of smoothing and it kind of was
annoying for 4k video editing which is
what I use this mouse for it's the best
mouse I've used yet so if anything I'd
say the Logitech sensor as opposed to
the picsArt 3327 is actually a superior
sensor in this mouse and other than that
it's very nice the smoothing can help
out when you're playing FPS games it was
good for dota 2 as well so since it is a
gaming mouse it's doing very well at
gaming the input latency as well is
extremely well when I'm using the PK
response test testing it into the
Logitech which we already know the
Logitech are pretty much near zero
latency in terms of input like this is
scoring pretty much exactly the same so
they've done a great job of everything
involved on the hardware level I just
think the software side at the moment is
letting this mouse down so I'd like to
see them overhaul their software but
let's move over now straight to this one
right here this is the m5 which is
actually a little bit more expensive
it's coming in at 79 ozzie dollars so
it's pretty much double the price of the
m2 and it's also coming in in the US at
70 USD so this has got more RGB bling
it's got that palm grip style shape to
it and it does weigh in at roughly 120
grams so you can add weights to it if
you like and I really did like the shape
of what they've done with this the
curvatures of the buttons at the end it
is a fantastic shape and also the sensor
I like it a lot better than the m2 even
though it's still a pic side it's a
picks off 3389 I didn't notice the same
smoothing that the m2 had so I really
liked this in FPS if you've got a large
hand and you like a palm grip this is
really gonna do well the input latency
like the m2 is very low it's a very
comfortable Mouse however it is designed
right hands you do have two buttons on
the side so you do get two extra buttons
on the m2 as opposed to the m5 and the
cable is very lightweight and the scroll
will feel similar to that of the m2 so
it won't be a problem
the little rattle that zai talked about
in his video I think that's just to do
with the scroll wheel being loose in
terms of the way it's designed I don't
think it's an actual problem itself if
anything the Corsair dark core Pro which
is like one of the most expensive - out
there still has that same little rattle
in it so it's not only the warrior oh
it's just the design feature of the
scroll wheel itself in the software this
has the ability to control the liftoff
distance I do like to leave this on high
when I put it on the lowest setting I
started even having problems tracking
right close down to the mouse pad one
thing about the software - since I did
plug both of these in once I plugged the
m2 in I lost the ability to change the
liftoff distance on this m5 so again
coming back to that software it does
need an overhaul in how it's designed
it's really letting both these mice down
because they are a fantastic design
everything high actuation points low
input latency great shape in the case of
the m5 really good sensor then in the
case of the m2 I'd like to see an
improve sensor improve software and Oris
will have a very competitive Mouse
lineup on their hands so next up here
we've got the ab 500 their mouse pad as
well as their h5 gaming headset now the
mouse pad straight away is what they
call a hybrid mouse pad so it's sort of
like a mixture between a cloth surface
and a hard type surface and to be fair
it was sort of like I think it was kind
of hit or miss depending on the mouse
for instance the m2 it just sort of had
too much friction so I really didn't
like it with that Mouse but then the m5
and also the g1 or - for example they
went really nicely on this mouse pad and
then of course this the g4 - just had
too much friction as well so it's kind
of like this mouse pad I still prefer my
cloth this one here is still kind of I
don't I'm not really digging that too
much but maybe if it's something that
you have been longing for in terms of a
hybrid mouse pad it might be for you the
headset itself has RGB in it which I'm
not a big fan of because it does add to
the cost but I guess if you want to
customize everything
do it's there but the actual quality and
comfort of it was pretty good up until
you wear it for a few hours and then
sort of like the hard base inside the
ear cup here starts digging into your
ear so I did find it very comfortable at
first very lightweight then it started
digging into my ears but to move on to
the sound quality you've got a 3.5 mill
and a log jacks so one for you mic one
for your audio out and the bass was very
decent for these headphones as well as
the treble being very clear so there are
a nice gaming heads they do give you
good 3d imaging and we used it with the
Mayflower DAC camp and I could hear
enemies in games very easy so now as for
the microphone and the headset I knew a
guy called Tim and he actually wanted to
change his name to 10 and then I asked
him why would you want to change your
name to 10 and he said well I was
thinking about buying the gigabyte Horus
h5 headset and I didn't know if I'd been
tinny in advance so if it was tinny my
name would be 10 and then we'd have some
synergy going on between the headset and
myself and I said to him well perhaps
you should wait for this microphone test
and see if there is actually tin inside
that microphone as for the pricing Horus
are asking 75 USD or 109 Aussie dollars
GST inclusive for this headset and I
think at this price
there's better options out there so if
you get this on sale then and you want
something that's reliable for gaming
that's gonna be good but I feel at the
moment there are some better options out
there for the money now as we're typing
on the k9 I was really blown away by
this keyboard it was very easy very
smooth nice to type on of course I do
like the blue switches they've used and
you guys hear it now however they aren't
Cherry MX Blues in the case of the k7
they are actually using Cherry MX
switches but with this they've decided
to go with the k9 for a switch called
flare tech and this enables you to
actually not only remove the key caps
which they've used PBG key gaps on the
canine which is very nice but they're
actually allowing you to take out the
switch altogether and change it for a
different type of switch if you wish to
so if you don't like the Blues you can
change them over to Red's and with this
k9 in batik
they include nine extra linear switches
with the different key caps orange key
caps you can change over on the wires
keys so if you don't like the noise of
the Blues at night for example and all
you're doing is gaming you can change
them over to a linear key and I keep the
noise down but in terms of the noise on
these blue switches from Flair tech
themselves I notice they are a little
bit quieter than a typical Cherry MX
blue and on top of that the actuation
points on both the linear and the blue
switches they've used here are very high
so I was playing dota 2 and I was
surprised
this thing was reacting very quickly now
the funny thing is about the flare tech
switches are they are actually an
optical switch and so with that they
technically have analog input if the
game or said application could support
that and so if you press it a little bit
down you can slowly walk if you press it
all the way down you can run for example
though I didn't really come into
anything that I could use these analog
switches with but they are optical so
they will apparently have double the
lifespan of a hundred million clicks
versus a Cherry MX which has 50 million
for example but even then I mean I think
I'd be dead before I click to switch 50
million times and then the loss of the
products we've got here from ores to
check out is the k7 which is a little
bit of a step down from the k9 not just
in price but also they're using ABS caps
as opposed to PBT and this time around
the we've got a linear switch in here
and Cherry MX red and the dampening
effect is gone on this keyboard as
opposed to the canine or even though I
had the blue which is a different switch
did feel like it had the dampening
effect at the bottom of the key presses
and you see here we've got a silver and
black tone as opposed to the other one
which had the black and black this here
is still missing the media volume change
and mute keys which I'd love to see them
include on these keyboards as for the
pricing the k7 is coming in at 149
Aussie dollars and 130 USD for the k9
it's 140 USD and in Australia hundred
and seventy nine Aussie dollars so for a
PBT keyboard I think the canine is
pretty good
the k7 is sort of right in there it's
got RGB control but there's still some
other keyboards out there off of the
same things for the same price so I was
really liking the canine with its extra
feature set I just love to see them
improve the software and the media keys
and that have an absolute winner of a
keyboard on their hands so now we're at
conclusion time with the Auris
peripherals and I gotta say I'm sitting
here and I'm thinking wow some of these
products are impressive but they just
miss out on those minor details and I
think if I don't know if this is or aces
or gigabytes first and go that's sort of
going deep into peripherals but if it is
they've done a very good job the best
product that came out of today's review
is the m5 and now I I know if you're
watching this dude you've got to plug
this thing in it's actually very good to
the point where the video editor here
Yousef here's a palm gripper and he's
got a pretty big hand and he uses the g4
o2 or should I say was using the g4 or
two he's now switching to this he loves
the mouse that much that he wants to use
this as his main daily driver when I
checked it out played some FPS with this
thing it had a really good sense that
the shape is amazing I like everything
on this mouse on a hardware level when
we're looking at the software of course
that's the Achilles heel with Oris and
all the peripherals here today I'd like
to see them improve their software
things like taking out a certain amount
of dpi levels cuz I only need two of
them in my mouse making the software
work flawlessly fixing typos making
things work correctly like the liftoff
distance but you can in the software
still change the necessities like the
dpi levels and you can change them on
horizontal and vertical and you can
change the liftoff distance as well as
changing the frequency which you'd
either wanted to either five hundred or
a thousand Hertz me personally I use it
at five hundred Hertz now if you do want
more in-depth reviews on mice and
peripherals then I do recommend heading
over to my good friend zyz channel
rocketjump ninja he does very in-depth
on reviews on peripherals me personally
I do know what I want from peripherals
but I may miss some details out
so if I do make sure you guys let us
know in the comment section below but
this is the m2 here now this one is so
close to being an absolute victory as
well except the sensor for me personally
that picsArt sensor they're using inside
this just have that noticeable smoothing
on it which affected me from choosing it
over the Logitech I think the shape and
the extra buttons on the right hand side
as well as the omron switches and the
actuation points on both these mice
making them absolute winners but this
one here the sensor is still inferior to
that g1 or two so if a Oris can improve
the sensor on this then they would have
an absolute winner on their hands for I
guess fingertip grippers but if you like
a bit of smoothing and you just want a
game on this thing and that's what you
want to do since it is a gaming mouse
then yeah I can recommend this one too
and then we'll go over the canine which
we took a look at before great keyboard
just needs media keys and then the k7
that is a solid option as well but again
both those keyboards need that
overhauled software and then they would
be really good too then the mousepad and
the headset they just really didn't do
much for me personally if that's your
kind of thing and you're into that then
maybe you might want to check it out but
me personally I just think there's
better mouse pads out there there's also
better headsets so I'd like to see or
ass drop the price of that headset and
to do away with RGB it doesn't need to
be on everything and even especially on
a headset other than that the speakers
on them are really good and so just
focus on from the ground up the speakers
and get them right the weight and the
shape and everything on that and you'll
have a winner in terms of the headset
then the mousepad of course that's the
hybrid they're going for that unique
design but that really depends on the
surface of the mouse and as we said here
two of the four mice both from Logitech
and Oris didn't really do well on that
mouse pad to the other two did okay but
I still much preferred a cloth mouse mat
and I always have it doesn't get much
better and so when you're getting to
that level now in 2019 peripherals
aren't getting a whole lot better and so
there's not much room for improvement
and so we are getting down to things
like these videos where I am nit
picking but that's because I already
have gear on my desk that I'm so
accustomed to and it does a very good
job and I need it to do a good job
otherwise you guys aren't gonna be
getting the content out as much as it
usually comes out and with that said I
hope you enjoyed today's video if you
did then be sure to hit that like button
let us know in the comment section below
what you think of the Auris jumping into
the peripherals market they asked me to
take a look at it and I did of course I
really liked Horace's graphics cards
gigabytes graphics cards their
motherboards the BIOS hopefully they've
done an overhaul on that but I'll take a
look at that when they maybe got their X
5 70s coming out so stay tuned for that
and with that said I'll catch you guys
in another tech video very soon and if
you enjoyed the content and often a wish
to hit that sub button bell implication
and if you want the inside scoop before
it even hits YouTube's a loop check your
city on Instagram love each and every
one of you look forward to catching you
in the next tech video peace out for now
