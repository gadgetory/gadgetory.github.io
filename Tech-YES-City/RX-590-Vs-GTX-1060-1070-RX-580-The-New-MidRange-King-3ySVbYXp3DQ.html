boy from XFX this got sent in about 12
hours before the NDA broke and honestly
that was not enough time to properly
review a graphics card so I've spent a
few extra days testing it out against
the likes of the GTX 1066 gigabyte also
the gtx 1070 rx 589 TRO and also the
Vega 56 reference card so let's get on
now with this review where we test a
heap of different games and then talk
about the tech inside this thing how a
difference from the rx 580 mainly and
who is this for and whether you would
want to purchase it or not
590 body body
so there it is the benchmarks are done
and dusted with the RX five and ninety
eighty fat girl that's mainly cuz I like
to call my tech products either a lady
or a thot just depends on the how good
the product it is itself and what we
have here is definitely a lady she goes
pretty high when it comes to the gaming
performance as we saw with those
benchmarks in games it depends on the
game itself some titles will favor
AMD some titles will favor in video
Forza horizon 4 for example did very
well on the AMD cards ironically enough
that's a more later and greater title
when we look at the game like dota 2
that perform better on the Nvidia cards
very popular multiplayer title but in
ways I feel like it's an outdated engine
too so it does depend on what games you
play but ultimately something like the
fire strike score will give you solid
numbers that you can reliably make a
purchasing decision off and so with that
I decided to do a cost per point
analysis of all these grabs cards here
on the bench this does I feel bias a
little bit towards AMD in these graphs
but it does show you overall that the RX
580 out of the gravis cars are tested
here today does represent the best value
for money and rural gaming performance
but that's not taking into consideration
of power consumption and other features
that the board partners and also these
software developers like Nvidia and AMD
themselves will offer with the cards but
it does stand a reason that the rx 590
is coming awfully close to the RX 580
and it's actually a bigger gap over the
vague of 56 and when we look at the
overclocking itself because it's
important when we took a look at this
grabs card I did like the overclocking
it was easy to do on this card even
though the core clock itself only went
an extra literally 20 megahertz that's
all I could get out of it when I went to
1620 it actually lowered the scores and
fire strikes so it wasn't technically
stable but we went to the memory slider
we just simply slid that to the right
and got from 2000 megahertz quad pumped
to 2200 50 megahertz quad pump so over a
10% increase on the memory performance
and that's where the
vga bias will limit the overclocks on
the memory we've got literally a 10%
performance boost in GTA 5 and then when
we looked at 3d mark firestrike that
gave us a big boost as well so the RX
590 is being held back by its memory
configuration on the graphics card
itself and so if you do buy this
graphics card you can just easily raise
that memory slider just a one-click
overclock and you'll be getting some
very good performance figures power
consumption didn't go up as well and
this card itself the XFX Fatboy did do
very well in terms of thermals but also
noise the auto speeds didn't top 80
degrees it went to 79 degrees and 43%
fan speeds and it was actually very
quiet at these levels if you're in
summer for example so if things are
getting hot in your climate you may wish
to set their fan speeds manually to 60%
and that will drop the temperatures
dramatically so it depends on where you
live but if you like low noise this card
can definitely offer that but if you
also like keeping your components cool
this card can also offer that without
getting too noisy 80 and also 100%
however do get very noisy on this grabs
card just like most other solutions
anyway on to the Tek itself it has the
same amount of stream processors as the
rx 580 however this time around they're
using 12 nanometer versus 14 nanometer
and that allows for the higher clock
speeds pretty much similar to the risin
2000 series where they did make some
architectural tweaks but they also went
from 40 nanometer on the 1000 series to
12 nanometer plus as they called it on
the horizon 2000 series and this enabled
for better power efficiency but also
higher clock speeds it's kind of the
same deal except you're losing the power
efficiency because you are getting the
higher clock speeds on this grabs card
essentially a better rx 580 that
definitely topples the GTX 1060 and it
sort of comes in between that gtx 1060
and gtx 1070 level as well as coming in
between the RX 580 and vega 56 level I
actually did like it more than the Vega
56 cards personally I thought with that
easy overclock it did start getting
closer to Vega 56 levels and you do get
the benefits of free sync and it's not
too pricy I mean at 280 US dollars this
is what you can buy it for Street retail
prices the rx 580 when I took a look at
the street prices there around about two
hundred and forty dollars at least for
the Sapphire
addition that I used in today's review
you can get our x5 ATS that are going
cheaper for around two hundred US
dollars to two hundred and ten so if
you're after a bargain in that sense you
managed to go snatch one of them up as
it will skew the price per point as we
showed before a price per frame more
towards the rx 580 than ever but in all
in all with this graphics card it is a
nice little unit from XFX I like the
actual implementation of the car itself
but speaking of the rx 590 is it worth
it that's probably the biggest question
and something you will notice with
gravis cards is that the higher the
performance the less value orientated
that gravis car becomes take for
instance an Archie X 20 80 TI and in
exaggeration but you'll get the point
you can pair that versa in RTX 20 70 and
you can literally get to RTX 20 70 s for
less than an Archie X 20 80 TI
and in terms of Raw price performance
they'll scale a lot better and so I feel
like the RX 590 is sitting right where
it should be it does perform better than
an rx 580 it does perform less than a
Vega 56 but at the same time it's also
better value than a Vega 56 but it's not
as good values in rx 580 but it is
coming close to those value levels and
you're still getting more absolute
performance if that makes any sense so
it's not too bad of a car but then
there's the other argument on the other
side of the fence and that is that we
have been sitting on this technology for
quite a long time and same with the
video with that 10 series cards we were
on those for a long time then we went to
the RT X 2000 we didn't get a whole lot
there and so I of course as an
enthusiast I would like to see more
innovation and more development and with
that more price performance but really
when it all comes down to it we get what
we get and I can only base my
recommendations off what we have at the
time so I am looking forward to the 7
nanometre navvy gravis cards but who
knows when they'll come and when they
come I'm really looking forward to them
I'm also looking forward to maybe the RT
X 3000 series if that's going to use a
smaller note as well so good times ahead
and this kind of feels like a stopgap
measure that doesn't do too bad and you
guys let me know in the comment section
below what you think of this big I guess
it's more than a 2 so
call it a two-and-a-half slot gravis
card XFX Fatboy rx 590 they've
definitely done a good job with the
carbon fiber black shroud backplate as
well as bringing in three DisplayPort to
HDMI and DVI out as well as bigger fans
than usual and it weighs in at roughly
eight hundred and sixty five grams so
solid unit itself it is coming in at
least from what I can see some of the
cheapest of the rx 590 lineup and that's
about all there is for it today if you
enjoyed this one then be sure to hit
that like button give it a big fat boi
life for us and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now
