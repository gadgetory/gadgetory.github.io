to Thailand to cover the galaxy OSI
event which was an awesome event by the
way GALEX hinted at a new Hall of Fame
gravis card being released in the first
quarter of 2008 een many of us sim
myself included thought that was a hint
at the new Volta gaming gravis cards but
as fate would have it it was actually
referring to the 1070 TI hall of fame so
here this card is and let's put it on
the test bench and see what it can do
welcome back to tech yet City this brand
coming to you guys today with a review
of this awesome card right here this is
the 1070 TI Hall of Fame now it is a 2.5
slot cooler so it is absolutely massive
and you do have to be careful what case
you're mounting it into it just fit in
my Corsair 740 case so it comes in at
around 31 centimeters long has a back
plate as well steel backplate got two
sections of our GP lighting Hall of Fame
on the side and a Hall of Fame on the
top which you can change the RGB
lighting itself in the software also
weighs in at one point three kilograms
has three fans as well and they do a
phenomenal job of cooling though of
course I'm sure you came here to see the
benchmarks so let's get on with those
so now when it comes to gaming in the
1070 I as you've seen in those results
it does fit in between the 1070 and the
1080 coming very close to the 1080 in a
lot of cases this graphics card here
what makes it so special however is the
noise when you were gaming you can
overclock this thing and even leave the
fan on the stock profile and you'll get
amazing temperatures I was measuring up
to 66 degrees of course though in those
temperature tests we did adjust them for
the deltas for those cards that I
previously tested in the past which were
tested at 25 degree ambient temperatures
so Delta wise the noise is impressive
the overclocks are impressive and of
course on the back of the card
you get the switch as well the switch
the missile-launch button what this will
do is put your fans on a hundred percent
and it will just be an easy to use
option especially if you're a crypto
minor as well but with that aside let's
take a quick listen to the noise
so what we saw those tests was two
different things if you're a gamer and
you are OCD about noise you can keep the
noise down and extremely quiet and still
game and still get really good
performance out of this graphics card
though if you are OCD about temperatures
then you can just turn the fan profile
up to max with that button and you'll
get some of the best and actually I
think this is actually the best
temperatures I've seen out of a graphics
card out of the box of course you can
put aftermarket coolers on but they will
perform very similar to this one this is
a really good cooling solution out of
the box extremely impressive with the
whole thing it's what makes this thing
absolutely beast tastic if that's a word
but comparing it side by side with the
1080 GTX 10 atti from gal axe their
standard edition
this thing just trumps it in size and
this is a 1070 TI so yes the 1080 Ti is
more powerful but that shows you what
the Hall of Fame can do why it's such a
powerful graphics card though of course
as much as I'm impressed by the 1070 TI
Hall of Fame they do come at a premium
especially even over galaxy's own 1070
TI graphics cards I'm told this is
commanding an extra $50 MSRP Oh a US
over that standard edition though of
course after seeing this card and seeing
what it can do and especially making it
in the league of its own especially in
terms of overclocking and the noise
profiles I would gladly pay that as a
consumer over the standard 1070 TI it is
one phenomenal card and also another
thing that makes this graphics card
really damn good is the mining
benchmarks now I know some people out
there not gonna like the fact that I'm
covering mining but in some of the
previous videos I am in that in-between
I am a gamer and a miner personally it's
actually the best performance I've seen
for a graphics card in terms of crypto
currencies as if Galax have basically
optimized this graphics card for
cryptocurrency mining at least on a qui
hash so with 0.3 dot for a wbf miner we
saw performance that was really
impressive when I overclocked this thing
190 watts total system draw from the
wall we're getting around 520 souls
which is extremely impressed this was
with the latest drivers from Nvidia the
three 90.7 seven they also made a slight
difference compared to the previous
drivers I have
my computer so if you are into mining
echo hash you'll probably want to update
to the latest drivers from Nvidia though
on that note as well the performance
when I did do a sweet spot clock which
I'm used to doing especially on a 1080
TR or 1080 with mining this card here
didn't really perform that well I mean I
dropped the TDP limit up the memory down
the clock a bit and we're getting around
470 souls and we're draining about a
hundred and eighty Watts consistently
from the wall out of the box however
were getting around 450 souls and that
was hovering between 170 and 200 watts
so it was inconsistent so if anything if
you are getting this graphs card you
will want to manually set especially the
fan speeds up to a hundred percent and
even lock in a sweet spot overclock for
this thing so in this case it's a rare
exception but if you were into mining I
would recommend overclocking this
graphics card which is weird because all
the other cards I've had through here I
would not recommend but for the extra
watts for the actual performance you're
getting it's highly recommended this is
a very enigmatic graphics card to say
the least and keep in mind I do not have
aircon in this studio here at the moment
it's very hot it's summer you may even
be able to see a little bit of sweat
coming off me
during this review so ultimately when it
comes down to the 1070 TI Hall of Fame
is a card that is equipped for gamers
and also miners I'm not gonna sit here
and beat around the bush and tell you
it's better for one and the other it's
actually well equipped for both
different markets of course the
cryptocurrency mining boom pretty much
making these things out of stock
everywhere I will update the description
when these things are back in stock for
you guys and let you know where you can
get one of these cards from so now
looking at those gaming benchmarks a
little bit more in depth you can see a
1080p on basically max settings on every
game this grab is card handle all those
games is over 100 FPS so if you're into
high refresh rate gaming and you like
your graphics settings really high this
car will deliver I think pop G was the
only game that got just slightly under a
hundred FPS average on max settings keep
in mind you can turn the settings down
to high and you'll get an absolutely
phenomenal experience even at 2k if we
step it up to 4k this card can handle
some games of course some games it can't
handle at 60fps but I don't think you'd
be
going for this card for 4k gaming even
though if you turned it down to medium
or high settings you'd still get 60fps
but there we have it guys this is a card
that does do very well when it comes to
gaming performance and the last thing to
touch on with the 1070 TI Hall of Fame
is quite simply the build quality you
get that of course 1.3 kilogram cooler
as we mentioned before white and silver
themed aesthetic you've also got RGB as
well to match it to the build even
though it comes with white LED lighting
out of the box one DVI 3 display ports
and one HDMI to point out on the rear of
the card you've also got that missile
launch button on the rear of the card
which is very easy to control if you
need fan speeds at your disposal you've
also got a white PCB which is 12 layers
and there's an 8 + three-phase power
design to go with that eight phases
dedicated to the GPU three-phase is
dedicated to the memory - 8 pin
connectors as well so this thing is
designed to overclock extremely high and
of course that air cooler is a
phenomenal out of the box - so basically
this is a graphics card that hits all
the boxes and I'm gonna give this thing
the yes seal of approval it impressed me
that much if you get one of these grams
cards you were going to be extremely
impressed with it though do keep in mind
as I said before if you are fitting this
into a case 31 centimeters long before
it fits into the case make sure you have
the clearance or this graphics card if
you wish to fit it into your current PC
case anyway guys hope you enjoyed
today's video if you did then be sure to
hit that like button and let me know in
the comments section below what you
think of the 1070 TI Hall of Fame and
I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon he's out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
