fellow Aussie youtuber Steve from
hardware unboxed and he sort of just
brought me into this whole ninety nine
hundred K temperature debate and I
noticed he was talking about Linus tech
tips as temperatures on their ninety
nine hundred K review and then I went
and watched it and I thought wow that is
a bit odd how they got 58 degrees on
load and they didn't state the ambient
temperatures but they have since updated
the comments section with a list of
settings they used so today we're gonna
be doing two things and since we do have
the same motherboard that they used in
their review this is the Maximus Hero 11
and yes I could finally read Roman
numerals now too by the way we're gonna
try and do some tests and show you guys
the numbers that we're getting here as
well as taking a look at OC 3ds numbers
as well
Steve said they did seem a bit low as
well and also another funny thing about
this is we have a deleted chip here and
we've also got a custom water loop so if
anything the temperatures should be
lower than what Linus tech tips was
getting with the H 115 I water cooler
that they used and also their settings
with all that aside let's just dive
right into it
so we got here the 9900 kids booted up
at completely default settings nothing
has been changed this time because this
is what you would get if you bought this
combination out of the box - the deleted
chip and a custom water cooler of course
use whatever you like but we've got the
same test up here stress FPU that's what
they've said that they've used in the
comments section and we're gonna clear
this here and then just do a new run and
we are at 24 degrees ambient
temperatures here so we're gonna hit
start and see what temperature's we get
but then also after that we're gonna go
into the BIOS and then run some of the
settings that they ran and then jump
back into Windows 2 but initially we can
see here we've already got temperatures
that are above that of 58 degrees
Celsius we're moving somewhere closer to
70 degrees C and again this is a deleted
chip with the custom water loop so it
should run and I already know it does
run cooler than H 115 I on the stock
soldered chip
so we're back here we're after ten
minutes and we can see the temperatures
they reached a maximum of 74 degrees
this is on stock settings but what we're
going to quickly do now before we reset
into the past is go now to Cinebench but
also the power consumption is 142 watts
so that is pretty much in line with what
Linus was getting in his review he said
139 watts so the stock settings seem
about right we'll quickly check these
Cinebench scores
so we're now here in the BIOS and these
are the main settings here that Linus
quickly changed they're all close to
each other
X and P profiles were enabled and then
we go down here to the multi core
enhancement we check disabled SV ID
behavior Intel's failsafe
lock that in so we're gonna go now and
reset this because they said everything
else in the comment section is left on
default and then we're gonna jump back
into Windows and see what temperature's
we can get so we booted up into the Ida
64 test now with the settings that
they've replicated in the comments
section and we're doing the stress FPU
hit start and our temperatures are
easily worse straight away than they
were when Linus attested his settings so
we're getting a max here of 78 degrees
that's what we hit just before but it
seems like oddly enough the temperatures
have throttled however so initially they
burst it up to 78 but now they've gone
down and they are hovering indeed around
that 58 degree range so I'm not sure if
maybe they average the temperatures out
and they just said okay this is what
they're looking like they'll be around
and perhaps there I am bein temperature
degree well maybe 5 degrees lower at 20
degrees that's a possibility
but will quickly run a Cinebench score
now for you guys and check out what's
going on with these settings locked in
okay so we've been running Cinebench we
previously recorded a quick segment that
we then reran the tests and the results
are actually all over the place with
these settings we're getting
temperatures that'll sometimes stay
under 60 degrees but then they'll decide
that they want to sort of break through
this 95 watt threshold and then go to
150 watts power consumption so it's
weird with these settings but most the
time we're getting Cinebench scores that
are now around seventeen hundred and
fifty points so I'm not entirely sure
what was going on with these settings
used in their results but regardless
what we're gonna do now is quickly try
and overclock this CPU
and replicate OC 3ds temperatures of 79
degrees and then of course jump to the
big one that's the conclusion
so we now overclock the CPU to 5
gigahertz we're running Ida 64 stress
tests across all the four different
options here and we're getting about max
89 degrees about two minutes in so at 10
degrees above OC 3ds overclock
temperatures we also got some really
good Cinebench numbers as well with this
five units overclock so it is locked in
stable with this particular CPU and
motherboard but without said let's jump
over to a conclusion now so in a
nutshell what I did here today with the
testing I couldn't replicate the results
that Linus tech tips got nor OC 3d got
but one thing I can tell you guys is is
that I think this calls for more
information that needs to be detailed
when reviewers do benchmarks because I
couldn't find any ambient temperatures
and in the case of OC 3ds settings on
their website too I couldn't find what
tests they use to stress tests and also
Linus had to put the information in the
comments section but ultimately when it
comes to results I can only vouch what I
see with my own eyes and that's what
happens here at my studio take a city I
can't go to Linus's tech tips office
it's all the way over in Canada I
believe and say hey guys I validated
their results I don't know I wasn't
there I don't know what happened I
believe some mistakes might have
happened but again I can't validate
anything that happened on their side in
terms of what numbers they got I believe
they just made some mistakes and they
maybe might have overlooked some
settings it happens all the time since
nowadays a lot of tech reviewers
especially youtubers don't get enough
time to review the products properly and
we've seen this with the RT X launch in
particular where we got the product I
didn't even get the RT X 27 t until like
literally the day after it was released
and it rocked up on my doorstep it's
like here review it and I'm like well I
missed the boat and so this kind of
forces us to I guess maybe rush reviews
and in the process make some mistakes
and I believe maybe that's what happened
in the case of Linus tech tips is
over in their office so but in the case
of OSI 3d and their results with their
overclocking in the temperatures I think
they need to state more things like
again ambient temperatures and also
watch stress tests they used because
I've got no idea and I can't replicate
it for me personally I use i-264 with
those four options checked because I've
found in my personal experience when I
do things like rendering 4k videos the
temperatures and the power consumption
matches up very accurate to this stress
test hence why I use it the way I use it
anyway guys these are the results stay
tuned for the D live video as well
there's kind of a spoiler for the daily
video we already filmed that and yeah
that was gonna be good but you've sort
of got a bit of a spoil now to that
video that's coming up soon
but dear letting does make a bit of a
difference and we'll find out exactly
some really cool results to be had and
if you enjoyed this video let me sure to
hit that like button and I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon peace
out for now bye and also go check out
Steve from hardware in box he's video
I'll put the link somewhere I'll put all
the links for all this stuff in the
