crucial booth in Taipei for 2017 and
today we're going to talk about a little
bit about their memory and also their
SSD components and there is a special
surprise as well crucial are going to be
releasing the bx 300 2017 Computex
coverage in taiwan was brought to you by
MSI and corsair bringing you the best in
pc peripherals and components click the
link in the description below to find
out more about current specials being
offered by both MSI and Corsair over the
Computex period so guys I'm joined now
with Jeremy how're you doing great thank
you yes and wonderful and so what is the
word with crucial in 2017 and micron and
ballistics and the tactical tracer line
yeah of course well you know we're
always kind of improving the technology
I think advanced over the last decade or
so you know we had Nvidia had their EPP
right for enhanced performance profiles
I got Intel XMP now you've got Rison
they all treat memory a little bit
differently so big big focus of ours is
to always ensure we have good
compatibility so we're here in Taiwan a
lot of the board guys are here so we
work real closely with them to make sure
they've got our parts they're testing
them and making sure when you get it you
get a product it works out of the box
and it's easy to assemble and make
everything work you know right right
when you assemble it right exactly yeah
cuz when I went up both crucial products
in the past they've always worked yeah
yeah we really focus on broad
compatibility when you look at all the
different chipsets processors and things
out there we may not always have the
fastest fastest memory out there but
part of the reason is we want to ensure
we're compatible across as many
platforms as possible so if you use our
tools you look at your mother word
manuals and things make sure you're
getting the right parts and that you got
the right speed we've got all the
different products to suit your needs
you know we've got sport which is kind
of our entry level here we've got
tactical which is a little faster lower
latency and an elite which is our
fastest product and it Computex we're
announcing a couple things on the
crucial brand just the kind of standard
memory you've got ddr4 2666 today it's
kind of been up to 2400 and 2666 has
been more of the gaming less shifting up
so you'll see the gaming stuff shipped
up higher speeds higher densities so
we've got some faster tactical we've got
a 16 gig 3,000
we'll have the elite up to 3,600 and
then probably the big announcement is
our tactical tracer ddr4 that's RGB so
you have to be able to do customized you
know to match the commuter system
manipulate the LEDs change the colors
and still get a great reliable and
stable compatible product so definitely
hitting the cosmedix
as well in 2017 so we've got cosmetics
and compatibility absolutely loving it
thanks for your time Jeremy so coming
into 2017 crucial we'll be releasing
their first ever RGB memory now this is
going to be different in ways because
you can remove the trace of bar at the
top and you can just have the LEDs
showing if you want to you can also 3d
print your own module install that and
have a different look if you want to let
different kinds of light come through
with this memory now with this lineup of
memory crucial do inform me that they
have two speeds coming out and that's 26
66 and also 3,000 defective this will be
on the RGB lineup with the tactical
traces however they do tell me that
these speeds are locked in as they love
compatibility and they like all their
products to work with all the different
board manufacturers asrock gigabyte MSI
and a Zeus they have the compatibility
there and with that they like to tell me
that they're the most trusted brand in
memory so they are releasing a lot of
different memory lineups not just the
tactical traces they will have the
ballistics which will be available in
different colors red white and grey I
believe and then also besides that they
have that BX 300 Drive hitting this
summer and with the lineup they also
have the basic memory lineup that does
come in and it does hit hard in terms of
price performance for people who don't
care about cosmetics so now guys I am
joined by Jon here's the Senior Product
Manager for crucial on the consumer SSD
lines and now how're you doing
well how about yourself really good so
loving Computex and we've got some
tricky questions for Jon and the first
one is coming off with the MX 300 which
I loved I thought it was a great Drive
especially for the money really good
price performance and really good
performance especially those long
endurance tests coming with the bx 300 I
think a lot of people wanted to know is
that going to be a repeat of the
the X 200 well it's going to be a great
Drive and it is we learned a lot in the
market from BX 200 but we learned a lot
from MX 300 in this Drive is going to
fill out our product segment the value
segment and we're really focused on
delivering a lot of great value great
performance in that value segment of the
market and I believe that we've learned
a lot from the MX 300 also we've been
able to bring that technology into the
BX segment and that's what your
customers should be looking for well
there you go guys so if you loved the MX
300 and the big 300 is looking like it's
going to hit harder even in the value
for money segment because with that
drive we're talking like we're taking
away the encryption at the hardware
level delivering satis a training like
performance in a value product so you
may not get all the extended features
like encryption you're just going to get
a good strong performing value drive so
there you go guys the Bix 300 is looking
like it will shape up to be a great
Drive and we're looking maybe around a
summer release yes summer or winter as
it may be in Australia we're looking for
a release later this year thank you very
much
and a great talking with you John
talking video as always thank you
you know guys that was it for the
Computex booth coverage in 2017 so it
looks like the main two focuses of the
crucial consumer line of products and
micron is that they're focusing on value
for money and also of course
compatibility and I think they're
definitely going to hit both of those in
2017 and I hope you enjoyed today's
video and if you did be sure to hit that
like button and let me know in the
comment section below what you think of
today's lineup from micron and I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon these alpha now they crucial
food and my stomach 100% compatibility</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
