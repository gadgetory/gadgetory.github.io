Computex and this year is no different
back at it again and before the event
starts I'm going to go use parts honey I
need to get some Ivy Bridge motherboards
this time around because Madden donated
a heap of i7 3770 and I want to be
building some pcs but I'm also joined by
a local Marco and he is going to help us
find the hot spots for use deal so it's
gonna be awesome because he speaks the
lingo last time I came here I couldn't
get any deals other than just flashing
cash and typing on a calculator and
learning very basic Chinese but this
time around is gonna be different and
also Marco is from a new branch of Zeus
and a daughter collaboration called azuz
tour as you don't want to tell us
quickly a little bit about that hey my
name is Marco I work at Asus store there
where collaboration between 8 assists
and 8 data and we sell nass devices for
your personal storage and with all that
aside let's get your pots hunting capes
on and get some deals
hey mates 2018 scant B text coverage was
brought to you by gigabyte and course it
bringing you that gear that you need to
put in your PC and build pcs so the
first place we're at now is called green
league and they've got a lot of
different motherboards here and I love
the motherboards they have confirmed
100% working I believe they even give
you a guarantee the prices are a little
bit high but I'm gonna sift through
these solid Ivy Bridge motherboards and
see if they can do deals for us so let's
see what we got here because there is a
massive selection but we're looking for
the ones with a reasonably solid VR Ram
so of course the more phases generally
the more better the VRM very simple
analogy but especially on this lineup
and since they're the same price that
1200 Taiwan dollars we're gonna be
picking out the ones with the most solid
vrm since we do plan on running i7 3770
s in these things so I'm gonna grab this
one straightaway I'm gonna take a look
at some other boards and get a
collection of them and see if they'll do
us a discount on say three or four of
these boards so pick up these three
boards here and they're not willing to
budge at all on the price and I'm
thinking well if I'm getting three of
them I should get at least a little
discount and they're like no they're
pretty firm on their prices so with that
in mind we're gonna go to the next place
and see if we can hunt for the pretty
much the same motherboards but see if we
get a better price so now we're at the
place called Chow ger and I came here
last year this exact place I was asking
for x58 they're really nice but now I'm
asking them for Ivy Bridge so we're
gonna check out what they've got oh this
one there I've seen thirteen hundred
which would be in USD terms about forty
five USD and I have picked up better in
the past so we're gonna just keep
looking around
so we went to a few more stores that
were bust even things like graphics
cards were overpriced here we went
around the Guang hua mall and all the
floors scour the place I've asked around
for boards a couple of places did have
brand new boards but they were asking
like double what I'm prepared to pay but
apparently outside the city is where the
deals are at so we're gonna go hit the
road if they're closed today we'll go
there tomorrow because I want to get
some really good deals I heard that they
have like literally boards for like 20
USD for the ones that I'm looking for so
that's true
that'll be a bargain and a half and I
may be just filling the suitcase up with
that but let's just keep on deal
Huntress
okay so we're now to place call that
somehow then now I think I got it right
again my Chinese is terrible so don't
hold it to me but we have picked up a
motherboard here this is a h-60 one from
asrock and they're offering us this for
half the price that are asking in the
city so we're now actually out of the
city and at this store and so we're
getting this for a little under 20 USD
so it may be like nineteen dollars I
think it is so incredible deal we're
gonna take this because it is confirmed
working as well and that's one deal in
the bag let's keep on hundred
sort of place now it's cold literally in
Chinese computer repair shop I can't
pronounce it for the life of me I've
tried but they've got a H 55 a zeus
board with a dual core i5 and now I told
the owner that the dual core is really
worth nothing nowadays so he wanted a
thousand Taiwanese dollars for it I got
him down to 700 so I'm about to hand
over this 700 now get myself in a Zeus
motherboard that of course will be ready
to pop in one of those X 34:40 Zeon's we
got ourselves one really good performing
PC
we're at a place called jet 3c now the
three C in the electronic stores in
Taiwan generally stands for consumer
electronics computers and communication
a cell phones but what we've got here is
some parts and I've managed to strike up
a deal on exactly what I was looking for
heat 67 motherboards the two of these
for 1500 Taiwanese dollars which would
be like 50 u.s. for both boards that's
together so that's like $25 each and it
includes an a320 120 I believe I don't
really need the i3 but it's exactly what
I'm looking for the boards are confirmed
working too so we're gonna grab these
bargains and put them in the case
so we're now at the final destination
called sancheong and this is home to the
night markets and we went to the
computer store except the boss wasn't
there until 6 p.m. so we've got a little
bit of time to burn we ate some
delicious Street food it's cheap it just
tastes so good but also when we're at
the store we did manage to see a few
motherboards they had two motherboards
I'm interested in and also a gtx 750 so
i'm gonna see if they can do a deal for
all three or if not they want too much
for the gtx 750 for example i'm gonna
see if i can get a deal on those pieces
of motherboards so let's get over there
so just go back to the hotel now and
that was a complete bust that last place
they essentially just wanted to charge
too much for the boards in my opinion
they even had an ACH sixty-seven
motherboard and they wanted around a
thousand Taiwan dollars for that and
that was the lowest they would go all
those boards like a thousand and it's
just really not that good value
considering I already came from the
other places I got like 600 for a h61
asrock board then I picked up a be 75
and then also to H 67 motherboards from
a Zeus
for really good prices so that just
really made the day going outside the
city and just experiencing a whole new
experience but also getting those deals
as well when it came to the city itself
of course you do pay the higher prices
but you do get that guarantee of those
boards working here outside the city
though just like the yo it works pay the
cash offer that we don't hear about it's
the city you kind of get a guarantee and
also of course the motherboards are
really clean if you go to the city but I
must give Marko a massive shoutout of
big thanks he really helped me he just
he spoke Chinese like practically
fluently so who is so easy to get around
and of course when it came to me
negotiating and speaking English he
quickly translated that did it so nicely
so it was a big help in getting the
deals and that's what I love about you
guys in the audience everywhere I go and
it seems to be someone ready to help us
and make these videos just that much
more awesome but now it's time to get
onto Computex I've got the knock ready
that's ready to go and also my video
editor although who did and I posted
this up on Twitter he did miss his
initial flight he should be here by the
5th in prime time to get those videos
edited because it's gonna be a lot of
them coming so if you guys have any
questions or comments as well be sure to
drop a comment comment section below if
you enjoyed this video I'm sure to hit
that like button and I'll catch another
tech video very soon I'm gonna get a
crash out now I'm so tired and I didn't
sleep on the plane last night so this
whole parts on today we've just been a
massive experience and so tired to
unranked this others porno right
actually I quickly walked into a camera
store and they've got some use pcs for
sale here I mean this doesn't look like
it's the best value I believe that would
be a hundred bucks
Australian which would be like 75 USD
off the top of my head that would be
about 200 so I have picked up better
deals in the past so yeah we're gonna
keep on moving on from this place
actually I spoke too soon that's
probably the only really good deal here
is a 1070 16 gigabytes of ddr4 also on
i7 6700 that'd be like about a thousand
Australian dollars that's actually
really solid sorry that's probably only
good deal here but of course I'm not
buying that because it can't fit that
the suitcase here we go just a suit
excuse me yes this guy man one year ago
hey one year ago do you remember me one
year ago man how's it going yeah last
year combi tanks I came here talking to
you for their motherboards I'm looking
for the motherboards no use motherboards
bad man what kind idly bridge as I said
II say yeah let me think
that's nobody
excellent VG on both
what what HD h61 you got something yeah
clay pipe tool but why could we outright
okay
you can you can film the motherboard but
you can't film the box okay no worries
no worries okay cool give me seconds
here all right that's cool man
I just looking for it it's uh so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
