the month we picked up 12 pcs in total
if you haven't seen already put the link
up here and i've also damaged my finger
while actually my thumb in the Alienware
pc build where we were sort of cleaning
that up and getting it ready but anyway
here are the three pcs that were
outstanding that les had at his house
that i couldn't pick up because they
couldn't fit in my cars we already
picked up a heap of different pcs and
what we're going to do now is
essentially a tech yes hurricane so
today i'm going to be like a one-armed -
tech yes citizen and we're gonna be
turning these into gaming pcs and see
what value we can extract as well as
taking a look at each pc case by case
but first things first i think i'm going
to clean up these om pcs we've got so
many of them they're packed full of
screws motherboards CPUs ram and even
solder cables believe it or not
so here's all the motherboards here now
we've got them with the faceplates we've
pulled them out and a lot of these don't
even need any converters or anything
they've just got 24 pins and they're
gonna work really well with gaming PCs
but we still have to piece out cases and
power supplies for these particular
builds and here is the current rubbish
pile that we've got here so all those
OEMs you generally I don't need the
power supplies from them because they're
usually only like 150 watts at best and
even a 1050 would be pushing those
things we've got some motherboards there
from the previous parts hunts that kind
of had those problems with the security
messages and stuff so I'll probably just
flip them individually to someone who
has time and wants to tinker around with
them and now over here we've got a heap
of SATA cables it's always good to mass
any screws or solder cables that you can
find and we've also got the hard drives
that we pulled out of there - 250
gigabytes one terabyte and also a 500
gigabyte hard drive and here we are now
with the first of the builds completed
but there is a little problem already
and that is the secure boot function on
the graphics card itself so we've got a
1060 in here and it just looks like it's
not going anywhere I've left that for
about five minutes now and yeah now it's
just turned off but oddly enough this
case isn't too bad it's 49 Aussie
dollars comes with RGB fans at the front
little RGB controller on the top and
I've added in a blue fan here and also
blue LED strips so giving it a little
bit more bling than it otherwise would
have but yeah you can just hear this
thing just beeping constantly it's gonna
be a case of me switching over the
gravis card and then putting in an
old-school graphics card just to get
into the boss and see if I can change
some settings around then try and put
this graphics card back in but the
problem is is that with one arm it's
actually quite hard to do all this so
doing these PC builds is taking me a
long
it's like literally taking me at least
ten times longer to build a PC than
otherwise would this is painful but it's
got to get done actually right as I
turned off the camera
it started booting into Windows this is
actually getting very interesting now so
I'm gonna try and install Windows and
then see what happens because this is
quite the odd one we cannot and will not
fail so here we go with the msi gtx 1066
gigabytes same things happening there's
no I guess legacy support I think that's
the one you need apparently some of the
nvidia cards have it so I'm just sort of
switching now between cards because the
same problems happening where it's just
not booting properly it will boot
eventually the windows but it's stuck on
a basic display driver so we're just
gonna keep cycling through some GPUs
until we get the one that hits the mark
so we've got an R X 480 this time it's
just absolutely no signal also we're
gonna put this build aside for now and
see what we can do so now we've got an
ASA board in this build here that's
doing the exact same thing and so you
know is one thing to do my thumb but now
it's another thing to just get problem
after problem bit yeah that's life so
now it's getting dark I had to change
around this motherboard and with a
disabled thumb it's kind of hard but we
got there and this is now working so one
of the four builds that were whippin up
here is finally alive and geto am in
those I mean LED fans look at them so
damn good and then you've got the LED
strip in there too and here we are with
the next PC and of course this one just
isn't even booting up properly at all
like after about five seconds it just
shuts off it doesn't give out a signal
so I've tried unplugging everything
tried plugging everything in again try
changing Ram try changing power supply
so yeah this stage I am starting to get
a little bit frustrated well here we are
we finally got a fix change the
motherboard around it ended up being the
1050 Ti so the Timothy I we had is not
giving out a signal so we got a 1060 in
here instead and
going to yeah get this on the road and
here we are with the third build and I
don't know if you guys can hear that but
this fan is like just running at full
speed so temperatures are absolutely
fine on the CPU so weird three four
three now this is the third PC and it
has another problem solution is at hand
though and a low-noise adapter fixed all
our problems so here's the loss of the
builds here and like okay I don't really
know what is going on at this stage this
is the fourth build and yeah we've fixed
up the other three pcs they're all ready
to go figured out all the problems but
this one just magically wants to turn
itself off so at this stage is pretty
late at night we're gonna figure out
what's going on this PC and then after
that we'll have all the PCs lined up
they're all good to go they're all ready
to clear out the studio so I can start
moving on to some juicy content like x58
and x79 stuff there it is that's the
lost PC there looks like it died in the
hurricane
so we've now got that PC working it's in
the morning and this is the Lenovo board
here that we pulled out so it is not
working properly so it's actually a dud
but one of the most interesting things
is I've had this power supply turned off
now for about probably about 20 minutes
and this fan just keeps spinning it's
like I don't know it's one of those cool
things I've never seen before and yes
I've tried draining the power it just
it's it's a nice wonder of the world
so drain power keep spinning it just
keep spinning
told you every guys in conclusion
sometimes things just don't go your way
in this case every PC we built they lost
four anyway they all have these little
problems and it was really annoying but
we'll figure this last one out it's
probably the motherboard because we
reuse that motherboard from the previous
build with the 1050 Ti because I thought
it was the temperature and that is like
the timid Ti is a dud it doesn't work
but I'm guessing the motherboard doesn't
work as well so sometimes these problems
they just happen and you just keep
moving you just keep moving and I mean
like couple that with my thumb which is
like you know make sure you hit that
like button as well because youtube
doesn't have a stitched-up thumb button
so besides that when it comes to
building pcs these things happen I just
I've learned to just go back let's
quickly diagnose a change memory change
vows bleh take everything off reset the
sea miles do all that stuff quickly and
go through it change the motions and
then you quickly come up with what the
problem is so in this case yeah we're
gonna change this motherboard and it
also sucks that those ISA motherboards
they don't support the Nvidia graphics
cards to boot from the get-go I didn't
know that I thought the ace of
motherboards were like the Holy Grail
since they didn't need any proprietary
connectors as well but that's the way it
goes sometimes we've got three or four
motherboards of my OEM boards that
aren't working properly so that's a
little bit annoying but regardless if
you guys know decent graphics cards that
work with the ace of boards let us know
in the comment section below because I
will keep them aside it's just you've
got to pair them with those boards that
work properly and and went into the BIOS
there was no secure boot option as well
so we're out of luck with that setting
and besides that we now have whipped up
a hurricane when we clear out the studio
just as we said just before and then
we're gonna be moving on to some juicy
content cheap builds as well as really
cool stuff different stuff and then
getting back to sort of that x58 next 79
grind as well fine now what's up with
that and I'll catch you guys in another
tech yes video soon make sure you hit
that like button as we said before and
I'll catch in the next one peace out for
now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
