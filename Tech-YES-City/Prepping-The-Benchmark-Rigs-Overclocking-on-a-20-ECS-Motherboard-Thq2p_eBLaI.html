the mini concept rig and putting jokers
5820k which he sent to me for pretty
cheap on it and overclocking it and also
building a Sandy Bridge PC for upcoming
benchmarks because why the hell not
welcome back to check yes it is brand
coming to you guys today we look at like
a vlog of some things are going to do
for upcoming benchmarks and one of those
things is going to be pulling apart this
open test bed here and then putting a
5820k on it overclocking it and also
putting that water cooler on it then
behind that I've got a z77 motherboard
with the Sandy Bridge CPU now I'm going
to be building that rig as well so let's
get on with this
you
all right so we got this test rig setup
the 5820k it's going on now Joker said
this thing could do 4.6 gigahertz at 1.3
volt I believe it is so we're going to
go put that to the test now and then see
if it's boots and see if it can go
through with the stress test so let's
get on with that now all right so we're
starting the benchmark now and we're
going to give this 10-minute run at 4.6
gigahertz so let's see if it can do this
okay maybe not 4.6 he hurts fully
completely stable alright so let's try
4.5 gigahertz this time and see if this
holds up with about 10 minutes of
benchmarking so we're now stable at 4.5
gigahertz for 10 minutes so this is a
pretty good CPU this is a 1.26 5 volt so
which give 4.6 gigahertz another shot
now by tweaking a few settings in the
bias and seeing if it works properly
so just doesn't look like 4.6 gigahertz
is working let's get on now to the Z 77
and 2500 K combo
you
all right so we're in the BIOS for the
ECS motherboard here on the z77 line and
I got to say this there's very limited
options here I have never seen a BIOS on
an overclocking motherboards being this
simplistic but we've got the ratio here
at 46 and we've got a weird setting here
overclocking extra bowling I think
that's extra voltage and it's got one
over 256 so I'm guessing that's like
every factor is one of like 256 I'm not
too sure like I've never seen this
setting before either so we're just
going to try and let it go at 46 and
that's all changed so we've literally
upped this from 33 all the way to 46 I'm
just going to see if that works when
you're going to save changes and exit
and hope and pray for the best
right so this is booted up fine into
windows at 4.6 gigahertz now we're just
going to run the stress test and see if
this CPU is all right I mean the voltage
here looks absolutely fine I mean that's
reasonable for a 4.6 gigahertz overclock
see there it's sitting around 1.3 3 volt
and this is where the mediocre su as
well like I'm not using anything super
fancy here so we're going to see if this
runs for 10 minutes at 4.6 gigahertz on
pretty much auto settings
okay so we've had this stress test
running for about an hour now and it's
passed with flying colors so we're going
to try and up it a little bit maybe to
4.8 gigahertz and see if it runs
all right so 4.8 doesn't work hey maybe
the auto voltage was gone a little bit
too high or maybe it just couldn't
connect with the computer on that level
because you know CPUs have feelings and
all that
alright so 4.7 has gone straight into
the desktop and crashed so we got lucky
at 4.6 that was straight away the first
overclock we locked in and it looks like
the sweet spot for this CPU and
motherboard so there we have it that CPU
from Joker the 5820k which cost me $250
did go up to 4 point 5 gigahertz stable
now I probably could have went to 4
point 6 gigahertz if I had a much better
power supply so I don't think Joker's
claims were too far off there and also
on that note with that z77 motherboard
the $20 friggin bargain especially when
a couple with that $80 2500 K which
overclocked all the way up to 4.6
gigahertz and for $100 combo that's
really damn good value one thing I will
say is that that's z77 motherboard that
is by far got to be the easiest
overclock I have ever done in my life
literally just hit the multiplier up to
46 save and exit and it's good to go and
actually are going to say the voltages
weren't too far off what I have
experienced with Sandy Bridge so I gotta
say that it's not such a bad thing that
you can overclock that easy
so I guess kudos to ECS on that front
even though that mother wood did only
have a 1 4 pin connector there which
probably limited it to going even higher
than 4.6 I'm not too sure there may have
been the CPU or it may have been that
full pin since it only allows it to go
to a hundred and 15 watts I think and
we're getting around about a hundred
watts at 4.6 so 46 gigahertz so I don't
know if that was the limiting factor but
even so 4.6 for the money that we paid
for this combo is really damn good value
there and I can't complain whatsoever so
without going too far off topic we now
have three systems set up here with
different architectures and also
different core counts so I'm really
looking forward to giving you guys some
of the benchmarks of these upcoming GPUs
on these systems so stay tuned for that
and if you like this video then please
give it a big thumbs up if you have any
questions or comments about the content
today's video be sure to
conversation below and I'll get back to
you as soon as I can if you haven't
ready subscribe and whatnot and all that
goodness because there's some awesome
videos to come and I'll catch him the
next one peace out for now
bye
oh damn man look at that look at that
Kurosaki Ichigo case I mean $35 like
where have you been all my life
criticized Ichigo case I know people
like over see the lady man what do I go
to kudasai kids you go from Brian it's
like damn brother I don't know and
you're gonna come to Japan and get one
of these things that's right pay 2 grand
for a flight and then just get a $35
case now worth it right there</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
