man in myself we had such a bizarre
thing happen where we're trading a
gaming PC for a clothing business but
that video is going to have to wait
until tomorrow because I've recently
beginning a lot of comments on my 24 23
- a CPU now this is a topic that I'm
going to talk about today where it's
local deals versus worldwide deals and
the two of them are not to be confused
because in a lot of my parts hunts a lot
of the time people are telling me they
can't get access to the deals that I can
get whether they live in a remote island
or they live in a place where the use
market is not healthy and the new market
is just simply overpriced
and so I did that video to cater for
those people wherever they are in the
world and now the reason I did it in
u.s. dollar pricing is because the USD
is the world's reserve currency pretty
much any currency in the world gets
converted to the USD as a benchmark and
the reason this is some websites don't
accept some local currencies and so in
order to buy stuff from that website you
have to then convert your local currency
into US dollars but also clear up some
confusion people are talking about the
risin 5 1,400 being better value than
the Xeon 24:23 - and now if you can get
this on a local deal for cheaper then of
course it's going to be a better deal
for instance I got an eye 74770
for under $100 in one of my recent
videos however I feel it'd be just
stupid of me to then get that eye 74770
which costs a hundred and seventy five
dollars for the CPU alone on Aliexpress
and then compare that to any of the
deals that are available on Aliexpress
but with that out of the way let's
compare two builds in today's video and
that is the 24 20 v2z on built and then
arisin v 1400 build both off Aliexpress
and see how they stack up in terms of
value for money and also performance
so taking a look at current prices on
Aliexpress we can put together two
different builds one being a risin 5
1400 where the CPU is actually extremely
good value for money at the moment being
67 dollars and 10 cents a motherboard
the cheapest I could find an a320 from
colorful is currently 61 dollars and 80
cents and then 2 4 gigabyte sticks of
ddr4 memory the cheapest I could find
this for is $38 for the pair this brings
the whole total to a hundred and sixty
six dollars and ninety cents shipped now
of course depending on where you live in
the world there may be import taxes so
getting the cheapest build possible can
be a more desirable option depending on
where you live in the world to bring
down import charges and duties and
that's why we're looking at the e5 24 20
feet to where the CPU alone cost $16 and
70 cents the motherboard 50 dollars and
90 cents and then the memory costs
around $16.80 free gigabytes so this
whole build tallies up to 84 dollars and
40 cents where you're roughly coming in
half the price of the Rison build and
also gonna say this before we move into
the comparison and that is there is
nothing and I mean nothing to be
embarrassed about if you can't afford
that extra $82.50 me personally with my
channel here I come from the grassroots
of growing up with very little and
that's something that's always going to
stick with me a techie air city which is
why I love budget builds which is why I
love these older Zeon's which is why I
love going deals hunting getting the
best bang for buck and ultimately
getting people into PC gaming because I
love PC gaming especially on a budget
but every guys pulling up the latest
Cinebench r20 here which is pretty much
the benchmark for getting a CPUs rough
performance we can see here in terms of
dollar per point the Xeon build on the
multi-threaded score does extremely well
the Rison still doing extremely well too
but it's not as good value for money for
these three pieces as is the Xeon moving
on to the single threaded score the Xeon
still edges out the Rison 5 1400 but
that's not to say that it's better value
for everyone of course the Rison 5 1400
is a
really good CPU and has better
performance I'm not gonna sit here and
tell you guys that once definitively
better than the other especially when it
comes to PC gaming that's your choice as
a consumer you can do what you want I'm
just presenting you with options here on
the channel but now here's a comment
that I think's a little bit absurd
someone requested that I test this with
an RT x20 atti
and I just thought to myself what is the
point no one in their right mind is
going to pair an $84 bare-bones combo
with an RT x20 atti or anyone for that
matter I don't imagine would pair a 2080
ti with a risin v 1,400 to me personally
that's like going out and buying a brand
new v8 sports car and then taking out
the v8 engine and putting in a six year
old four-cylinder and no one does it but
if you end up buying either of these
combos and then coupling it with a
budget graphics card you're going to get
really nice performance especially on
free-to-play games and games that don't
cost over $50 which I'm guessing if
you're on this budget you probably can't
afford those latest and greatest titles
anyway so it'd be a little bit
irrelevant to put them into comparison
when free-to-play titles are much better
benchmark to be testing in relation to
this budget but of course in this world
you do get what you pay for and
generally the more money you spend on
something it's going to be better in
terms of what it can do and now the
drawbacks of the older Zeon's of course
is generally in the feature set of the
motherboards they don't support things
like USB 3.1 the V RMS aren't the best
but in this case the Xeon only sips
power to the point where you don't
really have to worry about that v RM of
course the bios is outdated and old
looking but that bias is really not
going to affect your FPS and neither is
USB 3 speeds and when we look at the
Verizon v 1400 it is undoubtedly a
better combo to get however it is more
expensive as we said before it does
carry avx2 instruction set does have USB
3 and if you can afford that extra money
and you want to do some video editing in
the future then this is probably going
to be a better buy for you but also on
the same token if we're looking at
worldwide deals another youtuber by the
name of Phil's computer labs has tested
out an 8 core Xeon for example the 26 18
9 this combination of CPU motherboard
and 16 gigabytes of ddr3 memory can
still be had for cheaper than the raisin
5 1400 combo and you're getting double
the cause you are still getting USB 3
and also solder 3 ports on the board so
basically at the end of the day value is
what you want to make it and in closing
out this video there's a big difference
between world wide deals and local deals
and I don't want to confuse the two I
always stress here on the channel get
local deals if you can they're generally
going to be better than the worldwide
deals especially if you live in
Australia especially if you live in the
u.s. the UK the list goes on but there's
also a big list for those countries that
don't have local deals for instance when
I was in New Caledonia I was shocked and
I spoke to the locals there and there
was just nothing the used market was a
complete bust the new prices of parts it
was like over $2,000 for a PC with an
i-5 and a GTX 1063 gigabyte no one in
their right mind would want to buy that
if they're looking for value for money
so me putting up these worldwide deals
gives those people like the people in
New Caledonia an option to get into PC
gaming and still get decent performance
at low or medium settings at 1080p I
also said in those two videos that I
made with the e5 2420 v2 that if you
can't get local deals then this is
something you may wish to think about
but I think to me it's clear what's
happening here and that is that some
people have gone and taken my words on
local deals twisted them around and then
gone and get the worldwide deals and
overpaid for them and then compare them
against cheaper local deals with an
irrelevant graphics card for the
comparison and then drawing the
conclusion that the Zeon's a terrible
value for money which they're not think
of the worldwide deals like the Big Mac
index you can pretty much get a Big Mac
anywhere in the world and it will always
be a reasonable price
but me personally I like a local burger
joint called Betty's burgers they make a
really delicious burger but for someone
in another country they may not have
Betty's burgers and so if I'm
recommending them Betty's burgers they
might end up starving if that's the only
choice they want to go for so the Big
Mac is there as a last resort if they
need some to eat
and who guys that's it for today's video
if you guys want to see me for instance
compare the risin 5 1402 the e5 24 20 v2
and even the e5 26 89 Zeon's I can make
that three-way comparison happen just
let me know in the comment section below
what graphics cards you would like to
see tested and at the end of the day
thank you guys so much for all the love
and support you've shown us behind the
scenes I really appreciate it if
someone's telling you that Tek yes is
misleading you on anything I want you to
go tell that person to challenge me any
time any place any budget to a PC build
off and put their money where their
mouth is and without a sight I'll catch
each and every one of you in another
awesome tech video very soon if you
haven't already most to subscribe ring
that little bell icon and I'll catch you
guys in another tech video very soon
peace out for now be
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
