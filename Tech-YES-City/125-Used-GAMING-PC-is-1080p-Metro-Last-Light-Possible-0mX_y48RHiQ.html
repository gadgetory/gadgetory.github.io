exactly extract the most out of the LGA
771 CPU that I used however this time
around I am going to do just that I'm
going to overclock the X 54 60 and then
pop in a better graphics card and see
the potential that the LGA 775 platform
has to offer
welcome back to check yes it is brian
coming to you guys today with another
build in the used pc department this
time we're going with a 118 dollar pc so
it is a little bit more expensive than
that csgo potato that built before
however this time around we're able to
overclock the CPU and drop in a better
graphics card so we can get some better
performance so without further ado we
are going to look at the prices of the
pc parts then we're going to move on to
the build and the benchmarks
you
you
you
you
you
you
so that time to see if it boots okay
please turn ok cool it's working awesome
so we can see here we are getting a
signal out of this and we're actually
getting a message here that's quite
common if you haven't had a motherboard
power up in a long time it also can be
an indicator that the SI 203 - battery I
think is is pretty much dead so and
since it is a really old motherboard we
might replace that battery because we
are overclocking and we do want to hold
and store the values therefore the
overclocks
so there we have a guy's the benchmarks
do all the talking when it comes to this
PC that LGA 771 X 5460 at 4 gigahertz
really was doing a fantastic job at
playing all those games at 1080p I mean
counter-strike csgo absolutely no
problems even Metro last light was
getting over 70 frames per second in the
open-world environment at 1080p now this
was a very impressive accomplishment
I'll surprised when I saw this dota 2
was getting up and bugging absolutely
fine on decent settings and then we had
after that a four gig overclocked
running really cool at under sixty
degrees at 22 degrees ambient
temperatures so this VC was an absolute
bliss I was really impressed and it
actually made me a big believer in the
LGA 775 platform and also one other
thing that I wanted to talk about with
this line of CPU is the level 2 cache if
you guys didn't know I think the CPU has
12 megabytes of level 2 cache on board
which makes the gaming in my opinion
very good especially on those older
titles it was an absolutely blissful
experience really smooth and it's better
you know level 2 cache is better than
level 3 it's closer to the CPU cores and
it does a really good job and you've got
12 megabytes of that stuff loaded in
these CPUs so they've got great
potential when it comes to gaming and
even playing some of those later titles
like Metro last light now one thing that
I would have liked to have added on to
this build would have been a little bit
more memory I'm pretty comfortable with
6 gigabytes nowadays before was kind of
cutting it very thin even though the
games did run really well for what it
was worth anyway that's about it for me
today guys if you have any questions or
comments on the $118 PC then be sure to
drop a cone in the comment section below
and I'll get back to you as soon as I
can
if you haven't already hit that like
button and subscribe to check your city
for more content like this and I'll
catch you in the next one peace out for
now bye
yeah guys are gonna fashion about dudes
bread pacing my bare finger and the CPU</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
