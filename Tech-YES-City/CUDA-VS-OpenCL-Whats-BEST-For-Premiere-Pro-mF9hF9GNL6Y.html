welcome back to take your city this is
brian coming to you guys today with an
open CL versus cuda rendering in that
play in the air pool now moving on
straight into the benchmarks we sell all
these graphics cards in the final render
times pretty much scored in the same
league and if we turned off OpenCL or
cuda support our render times then went
up to like literally like six hours it
was you don't want to do that to
yourself when we get into the price
performance aspect we could see that one
card really stood out in my opinion and
this was the 7870 from sapphire this
card was an absolute beast man was it
performing absolutely fine in that 4k
editing workspace and also when it came
to the final render I still had room to
do other things like watch YouTube new
videos or talk on skype when we
contrasted that to its competitor the
660ti that thing was actually struggling
a little bit in the workspace and also
on the final render I found that I just
had no Headroom at all to do other
multitasking and then any other two
cards above these cards would just
simply overkill for Premiere Pro I found
the 980ti was scoring a not so important
victory over the iron 390 but like
Abby's deck and then the GTX 780 wasn't
as pumped up as it was to be with the
official support from Adobe now I'm sure
there's people out there wondering what
about After Effects and other programs
and also Sinha forum a very popular
codec in Hollywood my answer to that is
I just simply don't use that at the
moment I don't have time to include
transcoding into my workflow especially
since some of my projects I can have up
to like a hundred and fifty gigabytes of
footage and that's only going to wear
down my SSDs even further and then
lastly I will say there's a lot of other
good resources out there for Premiere
Pro except Adobe's website themselves
although with all that done I'm now
going to get back to doing the things
that I love and that's building
benchmarking and tuning gaming pieces
for you guys so stay tuned for that and
if you like this video then please give
it a big thumbs up if you have any
questions or comments about this video -
be sure to drop a cone in the comment
section below and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can
peace out for now bye
yeah get out of here you filthy 660 I
you haven't 7870 breath</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
