gentlemen it is time finally for the May
2018 s use PC parts on of the month
quick recap of last month however we got
that 980ti
we got it for a really good price gave
us some check yes loving in a recent
video and it is running absolutely fine
we also picked up that a3 machine with a
pretty good H 55 gigabyte motherboard
since then
I've got an X 44 Xeon for it so stay
tuned for a build with that little thing
as well looking forward to what price
performance magic we can do with it
though this month we are on the hunt for
practically everything gravis cart
species even monitors so without further
ado get your pc parts hunting capes on
and let's go hit those deals
today's video is brought to you by PC
forged tech with the ability to view
your PC parts in 3d and also customize a
build before you even begin building or
purchasing any parts it definitely has a
very useful purpose in today's world of
building custom pcs this is a
Kickstarter project in its initial
phases so if you want to go and support
this awesome project then the links are
in the description below
so now sifted through all the deals and
this month around the graphics cards
really there's not a whole lot of good
deals going on but there is some really
good deals on monitors and desktop PCs
and of course I was last month you guys
with a quest that I do a skirt --is--
accent so I've been practicing a little
but since then and we're going to give
them a call and see if they'll take me
offers so the first deal we're pulling
up here is a Verizon 5 1600 X it's gotta
be 350 motherboard got 16 gigabytes of
ddr4 memory 500 gigabyte SSD is well
really good power supply from EVGA h1 59
cooler from corset and an NZXT s340
all's we'd have to do is that in a
really solid graphics card and we could
make a profit on this thing if we flip
it so 800 astraying girls we're gonna
drop in 680 Randle's and of course in a
strand all is weaker than a US dollar so
that would bring it down to like 500 USD
which is an absolute bargain for
something of this specs
hello I am getting my Scottish accent a
bit of a workout and Adam doesn't even
have a phone number
so we'll just drop in an offer so next
day will get up here is again a whole PC
with an i5 4598 gigabytes of ddr3 h97
motherboard 120 gigabyte SSD also some
pretty good other specs like 700 watt
power supply also looks like it's got a
pretty solid cooler on board so I'm
gonna drop in an offer of 380 ozzie for
the 1050 Ti included and see if he'll
take it
hello Jason
yes MIT how's it going how much did you
get through
okay that was really weird like Jason
was a really nice guy and he's just he's
talking a lot and I can't really talk
much because I'm trying to hold down
this accent I'm worried that I'm
breaking the accent or whatnot that was
crazy but basically someone already
offered 400 so they came $20 over my
offer which for 400 Australian that's a
really good deal for the PC with a
tempered DTI in it anyway someone's
gonna get a really good gaming PC for
that money but also he did have some
spare leftovers and stuff so I'm gonna
talk with him about what he's still got
see if I can get any bargains out of him
cuz he seemed like a really cool dude
but let's get on to the next deal so
next up here we've got a GTX 970 from
gigabytes the wind force Edition not the
g1 the g1 I believe had the backplate
and in my opinion at least from my
testing I did in the past and people I
spoke with it was a better bendy card -
so we're gonna drop in an offer of a
hundred and eighty-eight strands and
he's asking 220 180 is not a bad price
for a 970 but in previous parts hunts
I've never picked up a 970 for a decent
price but we're gonna give it a shot
guys
okay so the guys cities name was Joseph
but when the boys answering it said
Jamil I might just stay clear of this
one guys let's move on to the next deal
so next day we got up here is a gtx 1050
TI not really a dealer that's current
price of 200 Aussie but if we put in an
offer say 135 that'll bring it down to
around 100 USD around those figures and
at that price it's actually a pretty
good deal you may all see you got an
album here on gumtree for a gtx 950 TI
yeah what's the last year Donnie also
made good stuff Frank Smith
B did I just hear that right
200 someone came in and paid asking
price for that 1050 TI that's a man it
must be a desperate game at the moment
for some of these graphics cards I mean
he would have clearly taken like 180 at
the very least he sounded like he was
surprised to that he got 200 bucks for
that card so maybe we shouldn't even
bother hunting anymore grab his cards
but that being said we still have a few
more deals to get through so the next
potential deal we've got up here is an
i-5 760 and which is a 4 core in an Acer
case and hopefully that case has a
decent power supply in multiple it's
also got a 2 terabyte hard drive
installed so also we'd have to do is add
in a decent graphics card but it's
asking 170 so if we drop in an offer of
say 120 that would really make it
worthwhile and actually a really good
deal was this Dean made yeah Suzy got an
i5 desktop here on gumtree 4 for 170
yeah me what's the lowest you do for me
Oh Godwin asked us many times I think
yeah I got cash and I can come to cut up
today if that's not a problem with you
just at the pump
yeah just like I'm generally sorry may
just depends on the place you know 150
150 is the lowest you'll go yeah my gum
tree two years ago 300 and I've upgrade
a little bit so I think like half twice
is pure enough oh great so completely
understand me yeah I got I was going to
offer c1 thority alright I was going to
offer 130 I'll meet you in the middle so
140 yeah yeah just a bit tight on Kish
well keep chopping know where he said no
I made thanks a lot all right so he
wanted 150 for it we got down to 140 so
I might send him a text and see if he's
interested in taking the 140 I mean I'd
love to check it out and see what's
inside that PC but we have picked up
better deals in the past of course it
depends I'll just send him a few texts
ask him if the hard drive still
relatively new what's the hard drive
about because if the hard drive still
pretty good it would make it worth while
the right on the fence with that deal
but let's try and pick up some other
stuff so now the next thing we got up
here is a 1080p monitor they're asking
75 AUD we're gonna drop in an offer of
50 and for a 1080p monitor at that price
that's a really good deal especially
since a lot of people when I sell PCs
they always ask if I've got a monitor
and it definitely adds to the value
sometimes it can even be the deal
breaker that sells you that PC and if
you can pick it up cheap enough then why
not mitchell's a government i'll see you
got an Arirang Gumtree for a Zeus V a
24-inch monitor take the damage she saw
it this morning how much did you get
home
I got 50 55 I think you about any
offered 50 by Korematsu 55 that's pretty
good deal made y'all's gonna pay about
the same for it yeah yeah sorry I
already saw it yeah no problems mate
thanks for your time sorry have a good
one okay we missed out on that deal as
well so someone has woken up on Saturday
morning and they are doing the rounds
it's about midday here where I'm at now
so I'm clearly missing out on some deals
here but we're gonna try one more
monitor and if that's gone then I know
exactly what's going on and the next up
here we've got a monitor but there's
actually no number to call but it's a
samsung 1080p monitor similar to these
Zeus no one's dropped in an offer yet so
perhaps actually someone hasn't come in
and try to pick this monitor up so we're
gonna drop in an offer of $60 see if
they'll respond so now there's actually
no more listings on gumtree that I would
be interested in there are some sellers
asking way too much for some of the
graphics cards or at least what I would
pay and it does look like it's a
seller's market does look like there's a
lot of people who are interested in
picking up use deals but like I said in
the previous part on you can get GT x10
60s for around 250 AUD which really
trumps all the value of these used grabs
cards especially a 1050 TI for 200 bucks
so I'm kind of confused what's going on
but hello is this Vanessa yeah so you
got an ad here on gumtree for a PC for
$60 can I come and get it today for say
50 yeah okay
I'm from the Gold Coast so come and get
us say in a couple of hours if that's
okay yeah okay or the only thing is have
you read the description it's um it
switches itself off every 15 min
it means some repairs here but if you
are an IT specialist to them you would
know what to do
that's absolutely no problems thanks
Vanessa I'll come and get it yeah yes
please okay so I didn't practice my
accent for a couple hours and I can feel
during that call that was going very
rusty but we've got a deal here and we
get to diagnose some problems but it's
an absolute bargain for the price I just
think it's overheating
that's usually the problem when it
switches off after 15 minutes let's go
pick up some deals
so now we just got back from the drive
and we picked up this monitor here for
60 Aussie dollars they also threw in a
keyboard as well so that's a pretty good
pickup but I did get a message from a
subscriber while I was in between all
this and they were on the Gold Coast
Carlos and he said look Brian I've got
some pots that I don't want need anymore
and some of them don't work some of them
do work I want you to have them and that
was a really big donation thank you very
much this is probably one of the coolest
things here the GTX 460 and it's a
cyclone Edition I can only stand it up
vertically it doesn't stand up any other
way also got some ddr3 memory that's for
an x58 motherboard six sticks of two
gigabytes gonna make 12 gigabytes for a
build also got two ddr2 sticks here and
a GTX 750 as well and a level 10 mouse
he says it doesn't work anymore he wants
me to do a video and see if I can repair
it Mouse so if you guys want to see me
try repair a mouse then I might as well
give that a shot and then there's an
external DAC and this is a really cool
thing here this case an old-school
Thermaltake armor so he said this thing
is messy it's dirty wants to see some
yes magic wants to see it build come out
of this thing so I'll see if we can
restore this really dirty case and give
us some tech yes loving and see what we
can do with it
but in terms of the deals themselves
we've only got one deal that PC that I
called up before that was phenomenal
value but it's all the way up in
Bundaberg and that is literally like a
five-hour drive one way so 10 hours all
the gas that I'd have to waste to go get
that thing it wouldn't even be worth it
after that but imagine if someone's in
Bundaberg they've got to go pick up that
PC but also there is tomorrow as well so
we're gonna wait and see if some
messages come back between now instead
of midday tomorrow and see if we can
pick up any more deals because even
though it's not a complete bust it's
getting close to that we can't do it
used PC parts on without getting like
some juicy news PC parts can we phone
call mr. flanken the next next
and the next day and the next day so
it's now Sunday and it's getting into
the late afternoon and all those deals
have practically fell through even the
deal from Dean he got back to me with a
photo of the internals of that computer
and unfortunately had an OEM motherboard
in it so that was ringing alarm bells
for me because you can't overclock your
ex 34 30s or x 34 forties eons on those
motherboards so really the potential of
that deal is not really there also in
terms of the gratest cards and other
stuff you saw that live have fell
through Jason never got back to me as
well that was the first person who I
called he said that he had some parts
available but something happens and no
idea but I did manage to line up one
deal for tomorrow and that is a pretty
good PC it's just over three hundred
dollars so if I can land that that'll be
awesome but in general I knew this day
was coming I've honestly been way too
lucky in the previous month's parts
hunts and it's just a statistical chance
where I'd run into bad luck and that's
exactly what happened this month around
I mean I didn't get some of those deals
just got edged out by other people
getting in earlier also other deals just
fell through so this is one of those
days one of those months but it's not to
worry because in one week's time I'll be
going to Taiwan for Computex but also
I'm getting in there early and we're
going on a used PC parts hunt over there
and I've also got a contact in Taiwan
who says he knows where all the good
spots are so stay tuned for that and
later on tonight as well I'm teaming up
with Danny from nerd on a budget and
we're gonna do a deal hunters showcase
as well special livestream told you guys
I was bringing a new episode into the
channel to sort of complement the
monthly deal hunts so if you want to see
that live make sure you click the email
bell you'll get notified as soon as
we're live-streaming hopefully if
YouTube systems not broken but look
forward to giving you that live stream
hopefully in about four or five hours
after this video is launched and also up
on Twitter I posted up a tweet of me
during the deals hunt just asking if you
guys had any ideas and thank you guys so
much for the replies I did check out
literally all those
that you guys suggested on that thread
and I couldn't find anything I came up
empty-handed it was a bust anyway guys
hope you enjoyed this one if you did
then be sure to hit that like button
also be sure to check out today's video
sponsor up PC for tech with their 3d
rendering software to get an idea of
what a PC build would look like and also
snap things into place before you even
build a PC and lastly let us know in the
comment section what accent you want for
the next month's part hunt
besides the Taiwan part hunt so there's
gonna be two parts hunts next month so
stay tuned and I'll catch another take
vo very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
