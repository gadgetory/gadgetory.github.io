gentlemen it is that time of the month
to go use PC parts hunting and get them
deals I've also got my spaceman jacket
on with that aside before it even begins
we have two deals on the table here
which are astronomical and that is the
x79 saber-tooth motherboard 32 gigabytes
of ddr3 memory and an i7 39 60 X we got
this for 300 Australian dollars which is
an absolute bargain beside that we also
have a case here which has a motherboard
which I'm looking for which will take us
30 770 I think it's got a nice three in
it for you bytes of RAM hard drive case
and a banger power play we've got this
490 strain dollars - now I've already
lined up two gtx 1070 s as well and well
they want to sell one of them at 440 or
you'll sell both of them at 870 strained
also that'll be about 320 us a pop very
cheap for gtx 1070 in this current
climate they're also throwing in the sli
bridge which i don't need somebody
pasting them into builds but also
there's another dilemma that we're
running into this month and that is
people from like interstate and also
over two hours drive away and now coming
to the gold coast to pick up gaming pcs
because there is that many people on the
coast where i'm living selling gaming
pcs the prices are going down and so
what we've got is people from other
cities coming and pick him up with over
two hour drive one way to go get these
pcs i'll surprise someone came the other
day and picked one up i was like dude
are you okay you sure he's like yeah man
where i live the gaming pcs the prices
suck so i guess that's one good thing to
come out of this bird let's get your
hustle on and go find them deals
welcome back to take a city in this
video here's almost finished rendering
once it's finished rendering will pull
up them deals that was for this one here
the resto druid PC hope you guys enjoyed
it it was just one of the my favorite
videos that I've done in a long time
editing it filming it and also bringing
something that someone didn't want into
something that someone really where a
lot of people really do want is what
it's all about attack yeah City so let's
pull up them deals
so first deal up here we're gonna
quickly pull it up before we pull up any
other deals and that is a GTX 980 it's
going over 290 stranding dollars he
isn't the ghost of all but has just been
listed two hours ago already got an
offer down so I'm gonna quickly called
this up and see if they'll take 250 for
it and we go get that immediately all
right so I just he wasn't picking up his
phone so I couldn't talk to him so I
just dropped in an offer of 260 ozzie so
see if he'll take that it is a custom
gtx 980 will perform pretty close I
think to around 16 17 thousand on the
fire strike score so they are pretty big
cards and they don't have that gimped
frame buffer so we'll see if he comes
back on that and let's move on now to
the next deal so we got a message back
from the GTX 980 that looks like it's
good to go so we're gonna pick that up
soon but we've got another deal here now
for ddr3 memory always needs some of
this stuff a gig kit they've upgraded a
ddr4 memory says it works absolutely
fine so we're to drop in an offer of 35
Ozzie it's a decent price if we can pick
it up for that even though they're
asking 60 they just might take it hey
Todd how are you mate good thank you
yeah I just got an ad up here on gumtree
for some ddr3 memory is that still
available how much were you looking to
get like in cash pickup terms okay
that's that's a gigabytes no worries
that's okay yeah I was just yeah I was
looking to get around like 35 40 bucks
that's about what of what I'm offering
for it sir that's it's just it's ddr3
minutes old like you don't know if it
works or not sighs just that's it yeah
yeah no worries man sorry sorry for
wasting you Tom wait okay so
straightaway I've set the tune there if
so someone else to now put in an offer
that's lower I mean he could message me
back and say hey I'll take 40 for it but
yeah $60 for a used kit of DDR
three memory and eight gigabytes not
really worth it I mean it might be
whether there's someone else's just for
me I'm prepared to pay 40 tops for that
kid next day we got up here is a thermal
take case and it's five dollars it's
missing a side panel but at five Ozzie
which is like three USD this is what PC
bargain hunting is all about and you get
this case you can put some hardware in
there and I really want to save this for
something special if I do like another
like League of Legends PC so let's give
it a call at five dollars he probably
doesn't even want to answer the phone so
now next up here is a really cool deal
and if I get this one I'm gonna have to
use dad man's you to go pick this up
because there's nine PC cases available
here and three of them have motherboards
in it but not only that they're just
cases that I don't really see a whole
lot as well old school cases that I can
really do some cool builds with so
they're asking ninety Ozzie I'm gonna
drop in an offer of seventy and see if
they'll take that and probably go up to
eighty I don't know but looks pretty
good anyway let's give it a try how was
it Jeff yeah yes oh yeah got an out up
here on gumtree mean how are you hey
nine PC cases is that still available
yeah would you take 74 if I come pick it
up today yeah yeah I've got a I've got a
ute I can borrow it and just come get
her we scored up for 70 bucks he was
pretty keen we probably could have gone
a little bit Lori sounded like he just
didn't care but seven cases for seventy
and sorry nine cases for seventy AUD
absolute bargain three of the
motherboards and I've been looking into
seeing if they work as well next up here
we've got a GTX 1063 gigabyte model
they're asking a 250 for it we're gonna
drop in an offer of 220 just give em a
call see if they take 220 if they do
we'll come pick it up today pretty good
price for a 1060 especially since we can
pop them in numerous builds and they are
pretty popular graphics card too
hello is this Nicolas I - oh you got an
ad up here on gumtree for a GTX 1060 is
that still available
would you take 220 pickup today
ok what's your what you're looking for
it are you not going any lower that's
right no Iseman thanks be done okay so
they want 250 for it I mean you can pick
up my brand new on like sales especially
for like 260 270 so you boys want to get
a deal if you can and that one 250 is
just not really a deal so next of a pawn
up here is a small form-factor PC though
with an i7 3770 and also fiber interior
I Drive a gigabytes of RAM has a 22 inch
monitor as well and comes with a
keyboard and mouse so if we pick this
whole deal up for around 230 AUD we'll
be laughing though they are asking 275
it just really depends on if they have
had any offers since they've listed the
computers for sale that's what it really
depends on but let's give it a shot
hello oh hey Steve how you going mate
yes you've got to add up here on gumtree
for a it's an office PC yeah is that the
is that are they still available are you
okay
what's the live show what's the last
you'll go for what are you offering at
2:30 pick it up today 50 you can have it
I sold else 250 I saw the L on for 250
I'd go halfway mate 240 all right cool
yeah all right cool all right just text
us the address and I'll come pick it off
and I clean up yeah pretty soon yeah
I'll come in next day
that is another deal in the back
that's the $10 saved $10 made brothers
so the last day we're pulling up here is
someone who's selling just a heap of
different parts they don't really ask
any specific prices for the gear but
they've got $200 on the listing and
that's like essentially for four
different pcs one of them being an i5
one of them being another PC with a
cooler and eight gigabytes of RAM so I'm
just gonna give them a call and see
it'll take $200 for the lot and if he
doesn't and I mean maybe I can come and
check it out and then sift through all
the good stuff and pick that out and
make a deal on the spot you didn't pick
up his phone I just quickly texted him
and said what do you want for the lot
I'll come pick it up at the price good
enough but with that aside we've already
got the Cape on we'd have to go put it
on we're gonna go get some deals
just got back to the studio now and we
picked up the 3770 deal and they
actually threw in two monitors for the
240 a you do absolutely crazy and also
picked up those nine cases as well but I
did leave one behind because it was just
so huge so massive and also it just had
a lot of a little bit of rust on it
anyway but that's a two deals done we've
got to go now pick up the GTX 980 and
also head to Southport as well because
the person with the $200 negotiable deal
that was the last deal we hunted they
got back to me and said come check out
this stuff and then let me know your
offer so we're gonna get these two deals
now and we should be good to go
so I've finally got back to the studio
for the final time and I do say final
time because we've been out three times
today the second time we came back we
did pick up that last it'll be called up
where they had $200 negotiable went over
there checked it out and there was two
pieces that were pretty much been were
that you like had like literally like
two gigabytes of ddr2 memory 512 sticks
no one wants that for a gaming PC but
there was two pcs there that were cream
of the crop sort of at least in the deal
terms he even threw in a monitor so we
got those two with ddr3 memory I think
it was 12 gigawatts in total 725 watt
power supply from coolermaster g-41
motherboard also an i5 3570 so that was
an awesome deal itself then we got that
3770 deal they even chucked in two
really good Dell monitors then they had
a gigabytes of RAM hard drive everything
that was just a really epic deal - then
we got a $5 case which was cool and $70
for nine cases I actually had to leave
one behind because it was too heavy and
it was a little bit rusted but some of
those other cases are just so good
they're so retro but they still look
funky there's gonna be so many cool
builds coming to the channel then we got
the graphics cards GTX 980 250 dollars
so when I went there I did say 260 but
when I got there I just said ah man I
can change over ten dollars I didn't
have any ten dollar notes and he said no
250 is fine so I picked that out for 250
then we last year we got was the 1074
440 down from 500 and of course before
this deals hunt even started today we
got the saber-tooth for 380 with 32
gigabytes of memory and a 6-quart well
thread a tie 739 60 X and this little
$90 PC right here
so that leaves these total parts whole
this month - fourteen hundred and
ninety-five AUD or in USD terms I think
it's like eleven hundred and 25 USD
absolute insanity this is probably one
of the biggest holes I've ever done here
on the channel at least in one day
freaking massive I can't believe it I
hope you guys have enjoyed this one
because I am pretty tired I just
doing this all day and just yeah it
doesn't stop but that's what it's like
around here I've got a lot on my hands
here to clean up so expect some use PC
spam to be coming out on the channel I
know a lot of you guys like that like
WeatherTech yes gonna be cleaning up
them PCs well I'm probably gonna have to
get some extra alcohol wipes in
definitely a few more cans of brake
cleaner and wd-40 because things are
about to get real here now in terms of
graphics cards as well we're gonna go
take a seat so I'm gonna talk about some
metas that are going on too so now when
we're talking about graphics cards I'm
not too concerned you saw me turn down
that gtx 1060 deal without a flinch
that's because it's not a really good
deal graphics cards are going to get
cheaper because you've got the minors
they're coming to a crunch then you've
got the new 11 series or 2000 series or
whatever and video wants to call it that
is coming very soon so when that perfect
storm arrives you're gonna see gravis
cards going out left right and center
for really good prices so what do you
want to do if you know that's coming you
want to be stocking up on cases power
supplies motherboard CPU Ram and that's
exactly what we're doing here so hope
you guys enjoyed this month's use parts
on please give it a big thumbs up if you
did let me know in the comment section
below what was your favorite deal of
today there's a lot to choose from and
also for next month if you do want an
accent let me know I spoke to a few I
spoke to a lot of you guys on the
discord server if you want to check that
out in the community tab a lot of people
agreed we're not gonna go with the
Indian accent just not gonna go there
if you've got another cool accent you
want me to pull off then let me know in
the comment section below also big
thanks to the patron and YouTube
sponsors supporters as well deaf I've
dropped a vlog as well we got a live
stream coming too for you guys hope you
enjoyed it and with that said I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye
also guys I actually think I made a
mistake one of those computers actually
didn't have a 500 gigabyte hard drive I
had a 500 kilobyte hard drive and one of
the other pcs had a 1 megabyte hard
drive in it also thanks for the
suggestions on Twitter I did check
through every one of those suggestions
and a lot of them came up empty-handed
however but did find a mini ITX case so
that was pretty awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
