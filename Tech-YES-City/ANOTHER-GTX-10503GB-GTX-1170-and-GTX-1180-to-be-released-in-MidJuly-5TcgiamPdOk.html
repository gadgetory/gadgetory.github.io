off here something is not right
let's click the fingers okay welcome
back to tech Dandi this is gonna be a
livestream we're gonna do for you guys
we're just gonna report on some hot news
so the reason hot news is that Nvidia
actually two stories with the video now
this is very important because use PC
parts owners and also people looking to
get new graphics cards will unite on
this news because we want new graphics
cards the new stuff it makes the use
stuff cheaper the new stuff of course
also makes the new stuff better
so biggest article dope we'll talk about
the new release a little bit later
biggest article we have up here first
off is the GTX 1050 is getting renamed
to the GTX 1050 and now Nvidia have done
this in the past with the GT 1030 and so
what we've seen here is a nerfed version
of the GT 1030 now I didn't really care
about this too much because I didn't
really recommend the GT 1030 to many
people it was a card that I really only
saw viable to people who had for
instance a small form-factor Dell or a
small form-factor HP PC and it was like
okay you can still use that crappy power
supply but you can get some performance
and play games like it was an i5 2400 or
something but in terms of everything
else if you're in the use scene a gtx
750ti was a much better choice it was a
bit of a whole different story all
together but now they're doing this
again so we're gonna pull up the
articles again so this time around I
mean the GZ 1030 it cost pretty much
exactly the same as the GT 1030 except
it had enough ddr4 memory as opposed to
gddr5 memory this time around they're
doing the same thing with the GTX 1050
but it's very odd they're giving it in
one extra gigabyte of VRAM so we go from
two gigabytes to three gigabytes and
we've got now a nerfed bit boss for the
memory
but we've got a higher boost clock and
base clock than the GTX 750 Ti so this
is one of those stories where you're
looking at and you're like okay my gtx
1050 could perform better than my gtx
1050 but it could also be performing
less than my gtx 1050 but sometimes it
could outperform the gtx 1050 TI it's
really confusing this whole naming
scheme in video and like like I said
before an order with the GT 1030 but
this time around it's happening again
with the GTX 1050 and the worst thing is
in the past
you guys have gotten this right on the
money
like here it is here the 88 series I
mean the 8800 series those four
different names for the same card
essentially so you guys know how to name
your cards but this time around I don't
know what's going on we've got a gtx
1062 variants we've got a GT 1030 which
could have easily been renamed to a GT
1020 or something and this time around
you could have renamed the GTX 1050 to
the GTX 1050 boost or something so what
we've got is a little bit of a whirring
scene here right cuz it's a 96 bit now
bit wired on the memory so it's like
they've knocked out a channel on the
memory here from the 1050 Ti and of
course with michurin they're seeing you
know higher clock speeds for the
temperatures yeah so this time around it
does look like it overall will be a
better thing for the tech community it
looks like you're gonna get better
performance out this cupboard it's right
around the corner from what appears to
be a rumored release of the gtx 1180 and
1170 now we know this has been coming
for a while because apparently someone
at Tom's Hardware Eagle there from the
Germany division they spoke with
insiders and they got the scoop and
apparently what is going on here is that
we're going to see these cards being
released in mid July and then of course
the Adam board partners they're gonna
get it in August and September and
release those custom models for you guys
but
also June 15th is when they expect the
adding board partners to get the actual
memory add in and the actual GPU dies
themselves so they can start making
these custom boards in terms of an
announcement though you probably
thinking okay when's this going to be
announced
it could be announced at GTCC Taiwan
that's actually before Computex Computex
is from June 5th and it Computex itself
Nvidia don't actually have a dedicated
press release at Computex I believe so
we're looking at here they got an AI
session and future trends but they do
have GTC Taiwan and in the past they
have announced new graphics cards at GGC
or GDC I think so it's interesting to
see what they're going to do what do you
guys think in the comments do you think
in video is going to take down D TV do
you think in video is going to release
these cards as they say because I
believe they're at a point now where
they have to release these graphics
cards because if they don't it's not
good for business so the stage where
they at least have to refresh them and
in terms of specs what we're looking at
here with the gtx 1180 is pretty much
the same cuda cores as the 1080 TI but
you're gonna see a more efficient card
so it's on 12 nanometer as opposed to 16
nanometer and you've also got GD gr 6
which itself is going to be more
efficient than GD tau 5x and now they've
also that and again guys these are room
and specs
nothing's concrete here but it does look
pretty solid and we've got here the gtx
1170 which is rumored to have 2688 CUDA
cores so there's a big cut down this
time around if this is true from the
1180 to the 1170 big cut down but of
course it's still gonna be probably it's
gonna be a lot more powerful than 1080
but it'll still be probably not as
powerful as a 1080 Ti that's just my
predictions so what do you guys think do
you think we are in for some good news
in the next couple of months at least
with the graphics cards are you guys
personally going to be
selling your ten series cards soon and
also what do you think about this naming
scheme I just think it's not a good
thing when invidia is sort of releasing
the same name on the graphics cards and
you're kind of a bit confused as to
what's going on so as I said before you
could have the same card beating the
same card but then losing and beating
the same card in a different game very
weird but anyway guys we're gonna go to
live chat yes I am live streaming this
it is a little bit weird because I've
got to do this whole event select an
event so we go see if live chats
cracking but yes we are live-streaming
this new news segment and we've got some
news builds coming soon so stay tuned
for that and I hope you guys enjoy this
kind of little news segment I have set
up the light desk you can see my head is
now being separated from the background
because I've got a new lamp here and
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed that little
news segment so we'll go over the chat
quickly answer some chat and then I'm
gonna get back to doing some used builds
for you guys and that's just going at
each other
so anyway also I've got to announce or
one thing as well YouTube has introduced
the new YouTube sponsors thing which is
a very similar to Twitch's subscribe
subscription thing and I guess in ways
it's kind of like hey you can help these
guys out because YouTube itself is like
yo Adsense might not be the best state
of currently so you can help out your
favorite creators by helping them by
sponsoring I mean you do get cool like
extra perks you do get an icon next to
your name and also I will be offering
the same perks as patron users so thank
you guys for watching also let me know
in the comment section below what you
think about all this jazz again if you
guys enjoyed the livestream format just
a quick live stream for the news
especially hop topics like this then I
can keep doing them for you guys and
when you're gonna do a gel it's so cool
questions come in what am I gonna do
gelid vs. cryo not will be ordering some
cryo not and then we'll be putting it on
it I think it's a 1080 TI or a 980 TI
either one of those gravis cards is a
very good comparison to can compare
these two thermal piece whose will be
going straight to the die to the cooler
itself
so stay tuned for that and I'll be
comparing those two bad boys because we
already know GC extreme the thermal
paste performs better then mx4 that's
coming out in the wild now and I hope
you guys enjoy that video too
I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon but this is just yet
pilot completely new let me know what
you think of the format yeah tech dundie
because people keep making jokes because
I'm from Australia about Crocodile
Dundee
so I figured we'll just call this tech
Dundee TV anyway guys hope you hope you
enjoyed it all and I will I'll actually
just stop the video but I'll join in
chat right now so there it is news
segment love y'all catch in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
