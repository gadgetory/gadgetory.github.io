easy coming at you guys today with a
vlog so I haven't done a vlog in a while
so I thought I'd just come out to you
guys and give you a vlog about the
Japanese I want to talk about Japanese
work culture as I got a request to talk
about Japanese work culture also i will
add in when i first came to Japan the
big differences in culture like what
kind of shocked me and what was a lot
different to Australia so will I will go
into that a bit later hey guys let's go
into also I'd like to thank you guys I'm
over 300 subscribers now switch is great
thanks a lot guys I'm I'm gonna give
away something soon you know because I
am staying make a little bit of money on
this YouTube thing so it's great guys
thanks a lot we've come this far and
keep going further and I'll start giving
back you know so if you guys have a
request for computer part or something
like not too expensive than I will
probably do something and give away
something so let me know guys in the
comments below what you kind of keen on
so I'll thinking of getting a new mouse
and reviewing it and then giving it away
so if you guys think that's a good idea
then let's go ahead and do that also
guys I want to talk about yeah so let's
talk about the Japanese work culture so
now in Japan when I came here and I
started working here there was a lot of
differences in the work culture and the
big differences are is I is that the the
Japanese are very very very very very
very punctual so you know if you my old
job it was just it was like
nothing I would describe it you know you
get to work one minute late man you get
like you get literally flamed on this
your boss will be like you wouldn't work
that's if you get caught though
meanwhile job was a sort of a freedom
thing that yeah if you got caught being
one minute late you got docked like a
whole day's salary so there was no point
you even working that day it was just so
stupid but my job now I am lucky you
know if I am two minutes late no one
really cares and you know if I'm very
very rarely if I'm 10 minutes late no
one cares again so I'm lucky at my job
now but my job at the moment is a bit
rare so most jobs in Japan will be fair
a punctual and the Japanese will like
they want formality is very important
here so like when you greet people you
bow you talk politely that is a huge
thing here guys you know they're they're
very strict on their work culture which
is a good thing and they take their work
seriously I tend to sometimes think
though that it is a detriment because
sometimes there's just too much
formality and people are afraid of
losing so I will give you an example at
my school I wanted to build a new
footpath because you know there's this
dirt road with rocks on it and the
parents when it's raining some of the
parents of walking and they you know
they got their heels on there walking
across this gravel and they hate it so
they're walking across the gravel and
you can just see on their faces that
like they wish there was a footpath
there so anyway I went to talk to the
principal he was like he doesn't really
is pretty here's a baller man my
principal has you know he's visible he
just doesn't really care like little
things like that he'll just be like yep
okay build your foot path but then he's
like I'll go get some help from these
people so I talked to the like the guy
there and anyway the the sort of the
office administration guy and here it is
like ah to build this footpath you might
have this problem this problem this
problem and I'm just thinking dude like
let's just build a foot part it's a
little footpath it's not really going to
matter you know if there's problems
along the way we can fix them I'm sure
it's a two hundred and fifty dollar
footpath I'm sure there's you know it's
not the end of the world if something
breaks or something stuffs up so anyway
this guy wastes about two hours
literally two hours explaining to me
what I read in you like what could go
wrong with the footpath ah you know if
there's if you put a block down if
there's a stone underneath it could
shake it's like yeah you know I did I
did you know do physics it at high
school so I do know basic principles of
you know how the earth works you know
and how you know gravity works you know
so anyway this guy's explaining crap to
me and you know I'm being formal I'm
saying yep okay well Connie master yep I
understand and it got to the point where
I just went out and bought the materials
and I just laid the whole footpath
myself and that was that I finished it
you know so that's one thing to remember
that's the detriment about you know the
people here they're afraid of failing
and it is a big and sometimes it can set
back the work culture and I was really
surprised I just went and laid the
footpath you know because I used to work
with my dad as a carpenter why don't
know like you know doing a bit of
handyman work here in there so you know
I do have a little bit of experience
doing those kind of things so I knew it
was going to be no problem and anyway I
put this foot bar down there like all
good job excellent job wow that's
fantastic and so it's just like well you
know it's not really rocket science to
build a little footpath so that's an
example of the work culture sort of
being a detriment but then again the
good thing about the Japanese work
culture let's go on to the positives
that is you know they really work as a
team they do like to communicate with
each other and give each other a lot of
respect so for instance when I was
making a new lesson they would give me
good feedback good input Briony you know
you should use the big projector and use
the overhead you really they say you're
really good at delivering speeches so
why don't you use the overhead projector
and get you know more emphasis and more
pictures out there and you know I did
that and my lessons started getting a
lot better and they helped me do that so
they're very attentive and they very
they focus on the job they work as a
team they do everything team orientated
really is surprising when you come over
here how people don't they're not I
don't know there's no there's no
sinister people conniving to step on you
and you know do anything bad by you so
that's something to remember now another
thing is too is that there seems to be a
system here that is still very strong so
the older you are generally the more
money you make the more respected you
are and of course the more power you
generally have so that my work
especially as well the older people are
the bosses and then it spirals down you
know cascades down to the younger people
sort of do on the you know the the slave
job the works they're really working
hard for I guess that system is still
pretty strong in Japan age is a big
thing
for me obviously I'm a foreigner it's
you know the foreign at my school I'm
the only foreigner there I'm like this
outcast that has you know a different
set of jobs and a different whole thing
that applies to me so that's something
to remember now there is a that's the
Japanese work culture in general yet
going on about that lastly is that its
overall it is different to what we know
they're not so big on asking for pay
rises and promotions and stuff like we
are you know in the West so you know in
Australia especially we you know we our
goal is to just keep upgrade and get
that cash get that cash their goal in
Japan is to really do their job and
their job is really important to them
it's just doing their job it's not it's
not really going for promotions and
stuff like that you don't really see
that much in the work culture so that
was a good thing when i noticed i did
you know for me it it you know it brings
people like i'm a down-to-earth guy and
I thought of I don't I'm not focused on
promoting myself you know if people
present the opportunities to me then I
will take the promotion which you know
it wasn't when I quit my last job and
went to this job I sort of saw that as a
promotion that it was because I was you
know of people's like I was starting to
become a people's person and network so
you kind of you meet new people and they
you know offer your offer your new
opportunities so that's something to
remember guys you know and just try a
network that's in regards to promotions
and stuff I don't know but yeah that's
basically the work culture in a nutshell
now i will talk about when i first got
to Japan what was the big differences in
culture compared to the also i got this
new thing here this is pretty cool so i
got this for ten dollars the hardware
store it's really cool like it really is
good but you can work out your back and
stuff like that it's awesome so sort of
like my new little toy for now so i'm
gonna play with it and you know you
might think I'll too easy but if it's
too easy start getting you know start
going in morn really
you know really getting into it so this
thing is a cool I recommend this was
only ten bucks pretty cool thing to
carry around with you while you walking
around stuff get onto when I first came
to Japan big differences was for me
coming from Australia it wasn't so much
the culture it was the weather I mean I
came from summer to winter and I got one
of the actually it was the worst cold
I've ever got in my life I had a real
big ear infection is ringing had to go
to the doctor get antibiotics it was
horrible so that be careful guys if
you're coming over in the winter if
you're from Australia especially the
weather is like bang that it is colder
here I mean it's not ridiculously cold
but you know after living here for a few
years but it is colder than what i would
have in the gold coast and I just was
never used to it so it was a big shock
for me the culture is it the culture
itself what what surprised me was that
arm how like generally how polite people
were I mean like in general if you you
know people helped me a lot oh this is
my my own experience when I went
somewhere you know for instance it was
raining when I got first got here I went
to a restaurant it was raining the
ladies like you don't have an umbrella
and I'm like no I don't have an umbrella
so what happened then was sorry my
computer just the monitor blent dimmed
down been talking for 10 minutes what
happened was the yes she gave me an
umbrella cause she saw I didn't have an
umbrella and I was like thank you very
much that's a really nice thing to do
you know offer a stranger and umbrella
so that was a really nice thing the
culture people yet like to talk a lot I
was in Nagoya when I first got here it's
a very big city very nice City I do
recommend it really nice city as well I
really had a good time in naga where my
two weeks two weeks training they're the
biggest things to were not just the
culture but like the thing I guess you
could sort of put into the culture was
that the restaurants you know you've got
all these little cool restaurants and I
will do another vlog on that guys i'll
do another vlog on restaurants in Japan
because it was really interesting like
you had convenience stores everywhere
where you could buy food buy drinks like
you know one kilometer down the road
another convenience store another 500
meters there was this little food store
yoshinoya you know there was all these
little restaurants and they're a lot
different to what we get in Australia
you go in there you've got a drink bar
you've got a menu where your organ you
know you yeah so that you do start like
your order and then you just pay and you
go so the definitely the eating and the
and the food and stuff was a lot
different the they've got a lot of
pachinko here which is if you guys know
that it's like the Japanese casinos
they're really crap I hate them because
you know as soon as I walk in there
they're just smoke infested there's so
much smoke in there that I just cannot
stand it you know I mean I occasionally
smoke with my friends but pachinko is
just too much it's like you walk in
there is just this smoke oven so be good
if it was a Dutch oven but unfortunately
it's not you know and that's another
thing to remember when you come to Japan
is that you know there's no gambling
really like in the sense of we play
poker on the tables and play roulette
you know blackjack they've got none of
that there I'd really do miss my
blackjack I love my blackjack at the
casino so in terms of supermarkets
they're generally the same our banking
is the same getting a phone here is one
thing that does kind of suck it you're
limited to getting a contract that's all
you can get that shocked me as well
because I just wanted to get a prepaid
mobile phone cuz you know I tend to use
my computer a lot you skype a lot to
call people and talk to my you know
friends and relatives yes you have to
get on a contract with a phone that was
a big shock to me also another thing
that was sort of some good things was
that the internet was really differ a
lot faster than Australia the internet
here is unbelievable I can do anything
on this internet like literally just
download movies play games at the same
time upload videos on youtube at the
same time you you know it is crazy what
you can do with the Japanese internet so
hopefully you guys that's answer your
questions about you know the fur the
biggest things when I first came here
what was the kind of the shock obviously
the language when I first came here I
just did not understand much but you can
get by with English like I found I could
get I within
wish you know but just living but you
know if you obviously if you want to
enjoy yourself a lot more you should get
out and meet people and have a bit of
fun so you guys I hope you've enjoyed
this vlog today if you've got any
