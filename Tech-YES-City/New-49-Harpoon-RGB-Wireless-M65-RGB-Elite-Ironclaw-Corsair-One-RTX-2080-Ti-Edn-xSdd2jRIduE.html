us right here we're at the Corsair booth
was ever announced three new mice and
yes we have the golden mic and yes there
is rumors of a ere 540 successor which I
have got confirmation of its coming in
the next couple of months but today here
we're gonna take a look at these new
mice what they feature as well as the
Corsair 1 refresh series that now has a
lot of new improvements as well as the
latest RT x graphics cards
so looking at my stairs this trend
that's slipping back towards wireless
mouse now because obviously having a
cable versus not having a cable it's
beneficial just not to have a cable all
together however there has always been
those concerns of unreliability
especially if you're in a clutch play
when you're in a competitive match for
instance whether it be dota 2 or csgo
you need that Mouse to guaranteed work
so they've introduced new technology to
combat this called slipstream where
essentially they've reduced the latency
to half a millisecond from one
millisecond as well as doubling the
bandwidth and making it stronger
connectivity so they're introducing this
on the harpoon RGB which is a $49 Mouse
it weighs 99 grams and there's touting
up to 60 hours battery life of course
the battery life will be less when the
RGB is turned on just like their
headsets in similar fashion
however the harpoon is probably my
favorite mouse from Coursera's it's the
smallest design if you guys didn't know
I'm a fingertip gripper and I do prefer
this kind of grip over the bigger Mouse
which they are introducing two of those
with the iron core coming in with RGB
105 grams as well as having the Pixar 33
91 now the harpoon RGB Wireless and also
the m65 RGB elite also feature this
sensor to who will get onto them in a
second the iron claw has the soft
braided cable and it has seven
programmable buttons as well as being a
palm grip is Mouse if you guys remember
the razor death at a very similar in
shape however it does feel a little bit
better in my hands though again I'm not
really a palm gripper so I don't have
much experience with this perhaps
rocketjump ninja would like to take a
look at this mouse and tell you if it's
any good weighs in at 105 grams so I do
like the weight however for a palm grip
is mice and of course you've got the
omron switches thrown in there which
makes the clicking just that good on
this mouse moving on now is the last in
the stack the RGB late m65 a very
popular mouse from Corsair sort of
in-between a fingertip grip and a palm
grip I do like this mouse however of
course I still prefer these smaller mice
this one's coming in with a $59 price
point just like the iron claw and it's
got two different models you've got the
glossy white and silver look as well as
having the all black they also feature
Emraan switches individual RGB
control zones which you can edit through
the IQ software as well as actually all
the mice here on display and also this
time around you can also adjust the
weight of the mouse itself in three
different zones so you can have a
comfortable feel the last thing about
the m65 RGB elite and also the iron claw
RGB is that they feature onboard
programmable profiles that can save and
on the go so you don't need to install
any software if you don't wish to so
there it is for the mice with corsair
they've actually got these featured on a
new mousepad as well that they're
introducing the mm 360 extra-large with
a 5 mil thickness versus a 3 mil
thickness and I must say that I do
prefer the thicker mousepad so hopefully
I'll be replacing my main mousepad with
this one but let's move on now to the
Corsair one and it's coming in with a
big refresh on not only the parts but
also the cooling system as well so now
we're moving onto Corsairs 1 systems
where they got three new designs coming
out with the i-140 the eye 160 and also
the eye 180 they do carry a hefty price
tag starting from two thousand nine
hundred and ninety nine dollars but at
that price point for the i-140 you do
get an RT x twenty eighty as well as a
9700 k and thirty two gigabytes of
memory for 80 gigabyte SSD nvm a two
terabyte hard drive as well as the fact
that they're using quality components
inside this so you've got a custom
radiator design on the left hand side I
think it's roughly a 220 mil slimline
radiator then on the right side they
have a custom 140 mil design these are
both using the Platinum RGB heads from
the original platinum coolers on their H
115 I for example and they're also
including the ML 140 mm fans to keep the
noise down on these particular systems
now moving to the I 160 they're pricing
this at three thousand five hundred and
ninety nine dollars however it does get
the upgrade of having the 20 80 TI and
also the 9900 k they're still using that
2666 memory and because they gotta get
into a small form-factor the using
samsung c die memory now for the
ascetics they're going with an old black
design on the i-140 and i 160 then
they're stepping up to the i 180 which
is more designed for content creators so
besides those III 70's in the smaller
option which are maxed out at 32
gigabytes of ram they
using a custom asrock x2 nine-nine
design with a 99 20 x12 core and it does
have a little bit of a beefier cooler on
the cpu extending up to 160 mil as well
as having a 750 watt power supply versus
a 600 watt power supply in these smaller
variants this will come with a price tag
of four thousand nine hundred and ninety
nine dollars however other upgrades on
this system include four dimm slots and
they're actually using sodium memory as
opposed to the I 160 and I 140 where
they're using a desktop sized memory to
88 pin also they are including a
two-year warranty on all models as well
as having no Thunderbolt three supports
so since their mini ITX systems on both
x2 99 and also c 370 don't support it
yet they don't have that option
available on these systems quite yet how
will with the design itself it is really
quiet in person it looks like it's doing
a very good job
they are touting very low temperatures
when the system is stress tested so that
is good to see that their cooling
solutions with those upgraded heads are
getting an upgrade over the previous one
models anyway that's about it for
today's video if you enjoyed this one -
be sure to hit that like button we'll be
covering some other booths so make sure
you stay tuned in terms of other cool
stuff on display here the prototypes
I'm just told the air 540 success is
coming but some other things they did
have on display is a wireless RGB
keyboard with their new capala --kx RGB
lighting which is essentially a lot
smaller and denser more efficient more
brighter than your typical 5050 LEDs so
they're working on those integrating
with the IQ software and they even
displaying that on the new dominated
memory which does look a lot different
from previous Corsair Vengeance RGB
memory so if you guys are digging this
make sure you hit that like button and
let us know in the comments section
below what was your favorite product on
display here and I'll catch you in
another CES video very soon peace out
for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
