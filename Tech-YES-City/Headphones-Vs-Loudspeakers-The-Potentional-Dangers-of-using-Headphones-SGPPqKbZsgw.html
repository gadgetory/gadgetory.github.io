you weapons of mass tinnitus
welcome back to tech a city this is
Barone's coming back to you guys today
with the video about headphones versus
loudspeakers and when you should use one
or the other now this video comes to me
is pretty much an unintentional
discovery or an unintentional shock that
I made when I was testing out a variety
of different headphones over the last
few months I will say however before we
get into this video I'm not an audio
engineer and I'm not a physicist so this
video don't take this video as concrete
proof it's pretty much just my findings
in my opinion on this matter and I will
say as well if there is an audio
engineer out there or some of that you
guys I employ you guys to comment in the
comment section and share your knowledge
because this video is ultimately about
just sharing knowledge and educating
myself as much as it is about educating
you guys anyway before we get on with
the video I will be talking about
decibels and SPL so if you guys want to
get up-to-date with that and you don't
know what that means I'll put a link in
the description below so you can know
what that means anyway let's move on now
to the first part and that is my
research in my history so as you guys
know I've been testing a variety of
different headphones and headsets over
the past few months and a lot of the
times these headphones and headsets they
left my ears ringing or stinging and
flaring up a condition otherwise known
as tinnitus so if you guys don't know
what tinnitus is I'll put a link in the
description below you can get up to date
with that but a lot of times it affected
my hearing to the stage where I was not
being able to hear people properly the
next day I mean it wasn't huge it wasn't
like oh my god I can't hear anything but
it was just a real annoyance and this is
the thing I'm going to emphasize through
this video this was all my listening
tests were pretty much done at
comfortable listening levels I never
really turned the volume up to
ridiculous levels or even something that
would be loud and so that's that's a
scary point and that's why I wanted to
share this video with you guys today and
point out the dangers of headphones
because a lot of time a lot of these
headphones actually left my ears just
sort of ringing like means this real bad
effect although maybe some of you guys
have had it before especially if you've
gone to a loud concert but anyway my
research involves me buying an SPL meter
from Amazon and then using I decided to
use two just very budget kind of
the Logitech G 230 which is a gaming
headset and I also decided to use some
is case these are a I think they're also
the tax star 2050s so there are very
cheap headphone but they sound very good
for the money
I then decided to volume match these
against my loudspeakers so everything
was volume matched at around about us
just below 70 decibels and I decided to
volume match this across three different
songs the songs I did was crying by
Chris Isaak somebody's crying
I also did booty in your face and Eddie
Murphy party all the time so I just
decided to do three different songs
volume match him and when I did this it
was all comfortable the listening levels
on all three the two headphones and the
loudspeakers it was comfortable however
this is where things got scary I decided
to grab a I decided to pull up two tests
a 300 Hertz test and a 2000 Hertz tests
and when I did the 2,000 Hertz test this
is at the same comfortable listening
levels mm test shocked me because
basically it's on the is KS it peaked to
87 decibels this is from a level that
was just below 70 decibels for me it's a
comfortable listening level just below
70 decibels is a really comfortable
listening level when I had that
comfortable same comfortable listening
level
it peaked all the way up to 88 decibels
on the 2000 Hertz sign test which to me
was really scary when I did this on the
Logitech G 2 30s it was the same deal
this is considered a low sensitivity
headset these picked up to 82 and a half
decibels when I ran that same test on my
loudspeakers they only peaked 272
decibels so we can see there's almost a
10 decibel difference in the peaks and
this is the thing the 2000 Hertz tests
it's one of the most dangerous
frequencies for your ears I think the
the human is most sensitive from 2 K to
6 K in terms of ink alerts so it's 2
kilohertz to 6 kill Urtz to be very
careful if you guys pull this test up
now be very careful because maybe after
5 seconds it'll leave your ears ringing
so I'll pull the put link in the
description below for the 2000 Hertz
test but be very careful with it I'm not
responsible for the damage you guys do
to your ears
but that's something that shocked me
when I did the 300 Hertz test things
were more in line the loudspeakers were
point 77 decibels the g2 30s were
pulling under 70 decibels only point 67
decibels and the ice caves were pulling
in the low 80s
however the 300 Hertz test it doesn't
really annoy my ears it didn't flare up
tinnitus at all
2,000 Hertz was the test that really
flared my ears up it got my ears like
ringing and stinging really hard so what
does this mean what does this research
essentially mean it means that basically
when we look at it the is K is at
comfortable listening levels compared to
loudspeakers peaked 15 decibels higher
and essentially this translates into at
comfortable listening levels headphones
have the potential to damage your ears
more than loudspeakers so I'll say that
one more time let headphones at
comfortable listening levels in my
opinion they have the potential to
damage your ears more than loudspeakers
so that's something to take out of this
video so why is this this is the part
where I'm not an audio engineer and I'm
not a physicist so I can't tell you
common concrete proof why it does this
however I do have some theories and that
is the first thing is the distance the
loudspeaker there's a lot more distance
between your ear and the speaker and so
the high SPL sounds or the high impact
sounds meet more resistance but when the
before the sound hits your is as opposed
to a headphone where there's just
generally there's not that much space
between the speaker and your ear so
those high impact sounds really just
travel down your ear canal a lot faster
and they don't meet as much resistance
as opposed to a loud speaker so the
second theory I have is that obviously
it's just the size of the speaker and
the sound signature of headphones in
general and that they got smaller
drivers and those smaller drivers are
able to pump out the treble or the
higher frequencies with ease so that's
that's my just my experience if there's
an audio engineer out there on or a
physicist that maybe they want to chime
in but anyway let's move on now to the
last part of the video so this is the
recommendations and conclusions and now
basically I'm going to say this is very
subjective because when I play for the
2000 Hertz
for example that might not affect the
next guy as much as it affected me so
ultimately it's your is you guys be the
judge with that being said the first
recommendation I'm going to make is that
use loudspeakers whenever you can only
use headphones when you absolutely have
to now for me personally the need for
headphones came about two years ago when
my baby was born before that I had never
used headphones or headsets maybe just
for like two minutes in my life but that
was about it so I only really started
consistently using headphones from about
two years ago when I bought the razor
carcases
as my baby was born I had to keep the
noise down but also be had to be able to
hear him so I needed a semi-open design
these things they are a godsend I will
talk about these a little bit later but
let's get on to the second
recommendation and that is keep volume
levels as low as possible
as low as comfortably possible so I'm
literally if you've got your volume at
like 70 maybe turn it down to 33 and
just let you is adjust and see if you
can hear the voices clearly for me I now
listen to audio at on my own board this
is on my onboard audio I now listen to
levels at 25 yes that's how low I listen
to music on board audio - so you guys
know how weak the amp is on an onboard
audio compared to say a dedicated
headphone amplifier I'm listening at
levels of 25 on my onboard audio with my
razor carcases now so let's talk about
headphones though my headphones now
there's only really I have only a few
different headphones in my arsenal as
you guys know I've sold a lot of the
different headphones I reviewed the
first one I have is my ghetto Heiser's
these are a custom job custom hack job I
did on some HD 5/9 5s and I turned them
into a gaming headset these things I
mean look the sound quality is
phenomenal these things sound a world
different compared to my razor carcases
however one thing these do is that they
just manage to leave my a flare up my
tinnitus if I listen to these for longer
than like literally 10 minutes
they are very accurate however I can
only listen to them even at levels of
like 20 or my onboard audio which is
comfortable they still managed to leave
my ears ringing and stinging however I
do love them when I'm
really when I need real accuracy when I
need to analyze sound I do keep these
around and they just provide a
phenomenal listening experience as well
they're the bass is a little bit better
than HD v normal HD v 9 5s and I made a
video about that it might get arises but
these are the next video I'm a I make
the next headphones I have hanging
around and these are the is case these
things are just amazing they're they're
$40 headphone I think they're called the
tax star 2050s I mean there's a lot of
different names for these a lot of
different Oh am a KERS make these things
and for $40 man they are a phenomenal
headphone however these after a good few
hours actually left my ears ringing and
stinging as well so that's something to
keep in mind also the comfort of these
is phenomenal as well I mean they're
really good I managed to do the 32 0
gameplay the flawless black ops 2
gameplay on this headphone so the sound
stage is amazing they're a semi-open
design and man the sound quality coming
out of these things is phenomenal I'll
be doing a mini review in another video
soon about these because there is
something you should do to make these
more comfortable and yeah the last
headset I have is the Razer carcases now
basically these are my main gaming
headset it's sad after all this time
I've come back to these things because
after literally an eight-hour gaming
session these headphones or this headset
does not leave my ears ringing and
stinging they don't flare up my tinnitus
at all so I don't know why that is I
mean I've tested so many different
headphones and these are like the only
one that I can have on my head for like
eight hours at a time and not affect me
I can still go to bed sleep peacefully
wake up the next day hear everyone fine
I don't know why that is but I do have a
theory and that is once I put them on
they you put them up like that and they
start to Sag down a bit after about an
hour and so the speaker's not actually
directly hitting your ear canal that's
the reason why I think these don't flare
up my tinnitus as much as other
headphones so that's something that was
just maybe it was just luck of the cards
I bought my first headset and they
happen to be the ones that don't flare
up tinnitus at all on then on a sidenote
yes they're muddy they don't sound
we're near as good as the other two
headphones I have here they don't even
sound as good as my KSC 75s which I use
for outdoor however I only use them for
exercising and so I only use them for
like 20 minutes at a time so I can't
really tell you if they are a long-term
gaming headset but yeah the only headset
I've had that comes through that does
not flare up my tinnitus is the Razer
carcases and no I'm not marketing for
racy you guys know me I don't care about
any of these companies Razer just I
don't know man
they're muddy headphones just seem to do
it they don't flare up my tinnitus
but anyway I'm going to close out now
and say in the end there your is be very
careful with your ears ladies and
gentlemen because in 10 years time you
know I want to be able to hear my baby
you know doing his first sports carnival
or whatnot I want to be able to be there
I want to be able to hear everything
perfectly so I'm going to be taking care
of my ears and I implore you guys to do
the exact same take care of us so when
you buy a pair of headphones try them
out I mean just buy them if you can do
like a trial for a day or borrow some
headphones from a friend just clean them
with alcohol wipes and when we give them
back cleaning with alcohol wipes - I
just test them for comfort and now
comfort encompasses a lot of things it
doesn't just in capacit for me when I
test headphones now I'm going to be
telling you guys do these headphones
flare up tinnitus especially for me
that's a new test that I want to know
because there's a lot of people on
different headphone forums that I've
been reading about who have some really
serious tinnitus problems so something
to keep in mind ladies and gentlemen and
ultimately I care about you guys and I
want you guys to take care of your ears
and now I'm going to close out I'm going
to make one more video about audio where
I just close out and do some mini
reviews of headphones for instance these
these things and other headphones that I
haven't reviewed and after that I will
be finished with audio and we're going
to get back to the juicy tech stuff I've
got a gtx 750ti mini ITX build coming
for you guys that is on order and with
that being said can I get a thumbs up
and if you love tech your city hit that
sub button and I'm going to roll the
outro piece out for now but
