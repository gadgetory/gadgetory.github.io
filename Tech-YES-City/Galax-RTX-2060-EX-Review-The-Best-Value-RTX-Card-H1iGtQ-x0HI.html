our TX 2060 samples and compared them
against one another and the results were
quite surprising I'll put the link up
here for that video if you haven't seen
it already but in today's video we're
gonna be taking this gal ax RT X 26 TX
model and then putting it on the test
bench and then heating things up in this
studio here to see how much ambient
temperatures but also fan speeds affect
performance on these graphics cards and
then after that we'll take a look at
this graphics card in depth and compare
it against the likes of a gtx 1660 as
well as an RX 570 and an RT x 2070 so
let's get this show on the road and of
course i know winter's coming with Game
of Thrones Game of r-tx
so we got right here the perfect day to
run these tests it's now 30 degrees in
the studio right now so it's actually
pretty hot and we're running a heap of
different benchmarks the first benchmark
we are doing here we'll just quickly put
that fan on auto so it doesn't make so
much noise
we're running Auto versus 100% fan
speeds and I'm also gonna be doing two
different benchmarks one will be 1440p
highest settings with max anti-aliasing
and also the other benchmark will be
just high settings 1440p so that way
we're going to get an idea of how much
ambient temperatures are affecting the
results and also if fan speeds at 100%
affect results so we've done all the
first-round tests we're gonna drop the
temperatures in here now hopefully to
below 25 degrees so that's if my aircon
because the studio is pretty big so
hopefully this aircon can cool it all
down to sub 25 degrees
so now we just finished testing this out
at 26 degrees ambient and the results
were a little bit interesting because
the fan speeds at a hundred percent
really didn't make a difference in
shadow of the Tomb Raider but the
ambient temperatures dropping four
degrees made a difference of one fps
both on the highest 1440p settings as
well as 1440p high with no anti-aliasing
on so that was pretty interesting to see
that because if we dropped the ambient
temperatures down even more say to 22 or
23 degrees I wonder if that would even
make more of a difference but currently
in the studio I think it's going to be
impossible today to get the temperatures
that low but anyway let's test out some
other cards here the 1660 as well as the
RX 570 and then give you guys a solo
conclusion on this galaxy RTX 2060 right
here
so now we've finished up here with all
the benchmarks in relation to the
different grammar scales that we tested
I can give you guys a conclusion on this
r-tx 2060 right here and basically I did
have two of these samples here white
version and a black version and they
really only differ in the aesthetics and
the logo that lights up on the side here
this one has the what's your game RGB
control which you can control via the
Galax extreme tuner software and then on
the white version it's just got the
gallic slow go which lights up on the
rear of the card you get a DVI port as
well as a HDMI 2.0 and a DisplayPort 1.4
so you can utilize the latest features
of this r-tx card as well as things like
DL SS and ray-tracing though Nvidia have
introduced support on the previous 10
series cards now which I will save for a
later date as you guys have reported
that 1080 T is can be had on the use
market for a similar price to this so if
everything checks out I will investigate
that give you guys a solid conclusion
but as it stands with a new graphics
card galux as well as gigabyte they're
really hitting hard at the MSRP so if
you want to pay that advertise retail
price instead of paying 30 $40 more for
those overclocked editions with beefier
coolers then this model will definitely
deliver as we saw at the average clock
speeds out of the box with GPU boost 4.0
it averaged out about nineteen hundred
and fifty-five megahertz so do get out
some pretty impressive numbers but the
biggest thing I like about the galaxy
cards and I've seen this not just with
this sample that every other sample
that's come through here ones that I've
bought off the shelves as well is that
they're tuned for efficiency and that is
when we pull up the power consumption
results for you guys you see that it's
really kicking hard in terms of its
power consumption but still giving out
solid fps and so galaxies really
fine-tuning their V bios to get the most
efficiency out of their cards and so in
turn this will basically put less of a
strain on the cooler which in total this
graphics card weighs in at around 650
grams also features a steel back plate
which will absorb some of the heat and
help with cooling on the front you get
two 90 mil fan
which don't get too loud but they do get
loud when I actually tested it with the
decibel meter to my ears it didn't sound
too loud but it was reporting about 60
decibels of 58 degrees Celsius at a
hundred percent fan speeds in a 25
degree controlled ambient environment
moving down to 80 percent fan speeds
source 65 degrees and around 54 decibels
then 70 degrees at 60% fan speeds and
around 47 decibels and then leaving this
card around Auto fan speeds showed about
58% and then 45 decibels in 71 degrees
Celsius so staying well under the
threshold of throttling and the cart is
measuring around 235 millimeters long
has a single 8 pin connector it is about
120 millimeters wide and is a dual slot
solution so will fit in most ATX cases
even the budget kind though it is
interesting to know that it is slightly
thicker by about 8 mil than the standard
founders Edition card but anyway when it
comes to gaming the r-tx 2060 is
definitely a very solid choice for high
FPS 1080p gaming and it can even do
1440p if you don't mind stepping down
the settings a little bit safe from
ultra too high then it'll definitely
play titles with ease at these
resolutions but when we compare it to
the other cards in the graph namely the
RX 570 the gtx 1660 and also the r-tx
2070 these are the four main cards that
I'd be looking at sales in the market
friend new graphics card the RT X 2070
has a little bit more juice use a little
bit more power it also has an extra to
give active erm and of course cost a
little bit more but it is that little
bit extra that you may wish to consider
especially if your 1440p gamer then we
got the GTS 1660 which does give our
better value for money in my opinion
then the RT X 2060 and will be a great
choice for 1080p gaming especially at
higher ultra settings then we got the rx
570 which is just a super good value for
money card especially if you're in the
use price performance so you can pick
them up for very cheap especially even
on things like eBay where they're
abundant in stock at the moment but I'll
send down the RT X 2060 it does slot
somewhere in between the mid-range and
the high-end I feel like it's not really
just a mid-range card and I feel like
it's definitely not a high-end car but I
feel like it's slots somewhere in
between
definitely let us know what you guys
think in the comment section below
but with that said the price point
match accordingly 350 US dollars in
Australia can pick it up for just a
little bit over 500 Aussie dollars which
does definitely make it a solid Buy if
you can get those eBay sales and that's
actually for this Galax card right here
I think in Australia especially Galax
and also gigabyte are doing a very good
job of hitting the market in terms of
delivering good cards especially when it
comes to price performance at those MSRP
s I know there's other card makers out
there that advertise the bigger coolers
the OSI models but they end up costing a
lot more to the point where you may
think about just stepping it up to that
next level graphics card and that's why
I think the Gallic scars are a really
solid purchase because at that MSRP
price range they're delivering the
aesthetics they're delivering the
performance and the thermals to boot and
of course you are still up to the
silicon lottery to how far these things
will boost and with that said I hope you
guys enjoyed today's sort of look at
ambient temperatures but also this
galaxy RTX 2060 if you did then be sure
to hit that like button also let us know
in the comment section below what you
think of the r-tx 2060 and also the
different models out there love reading
