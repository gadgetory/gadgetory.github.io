time of the month who used parts honey
and today we're going on gantry and
we're going to find a heap of good
graphics cards if we can now in my
previous vlog I got a heap of x58
motherboard we got them for a bargain
now the problem is of course we need
graphics cards now and I'm going to be
looking for that and of course I'll look
for some other deals if they pop up but
with that said let's go hunt for them
deals if you put up a few potential
bargain off of gum tree and the first
one is this 170 Australian dollars now
before we do any more searching I will
say that one of strangles about 80 US
cents so what you're seeing here is a
lot cheaper if it was in American
dollars
so it's 170 in strangles now we're going
to try and bother the guy down and see
if he'll take 140 dollars for it this is
a fork or a gigabytes of ddr3 if I were
to give a hard drive you get the case
power supply multi board and everything
like that and a really good thing is as
well as that I have an included bracket
a thin bracket for a low profile bracket
for a gtx 750ti
so I've got the perfect graphics card
exploding this if I'm able to get it now
the next day was filled up here is a 69
51 gigabyte card it's only going for 50
dogs and it's not too far away from
where I live so hopefully this guy will
take a $30 offer I think if you want to
get rid of this that is 1 gig so not
many people would be looking for a bit
of $30 it would be an awesome deal which
would be like 23 American dollars very
cheap next deal here one guy is selling
2 GTX 670 so we're going to come in at
60 Australian dollars a pop now if you
live in Spring Hill that is right in the
middle of the CBD I believe in Brisbane
so he's probably just looking to get rid
of these cards also some other awesome
deals going on gumtree is $100 at 7970
I'd like to ideally offer around 80 or
90 dollars for this card however the
problem is is it's just too far away
from where I live this would cost a lot
in petrol or gas depending on the term
you want to use for me to get up there
and get back it just simply wouldn't be
worth my time same with this GTX 580
another pretty solid card if you could
get this for $50 you'd be laughing but
the problem is again it's just too far
away from where I live so with all that
aside let's call up the first potential
buy and
Gumtree in australia as you guys already
know you have to put on a bogan voice if
you don't then you're quite simply a lot
of the time don't get the deals hey Cal
how you go mate yeah I saw you out on
gumtree for a HP 3300 oh yeah yeah oh
yeah yeah yeah May would you take 144 ah
I can come pick her up today yeah you
know I do want to just text you have you
got my number my address
yeah okay what time could I can pick her
up oh I'm just hitting home now bye
behind that big thing and after that
eight and then I'll just make sure I'll
just bring it out of storage make sure
your pals up in subpoenas a little while
since I started with these three I hop
it down and I'll fish my dress
no worries mate just let us know the
time and the address and I'll be there
all right all right thanks mate
whew that was a massive success we've
got that deal 140 bucks and of clothes
it's going to test it first make sure it
all works we're going to try and do the
next deal now Callay Jersey hello James
okay Oh Jerry I
so you add on gumtree for ASIS 6950 oh
yeah yeah yeah graphics card yes yeah
and would you take $35 for it
um I literally bought it 250 like plenty
a couple of weeks ago a so miles miles I
apologize for tlg to the 40 but
initially I need to support it like
couple weeks ago and I paid 50 400
switch - here my money back okay Mike
could you text us your address
yes are you you I'm going to cup yeah
yeah yes yeah okay no eyes I'll text my
adjuster now what time do you think
you'll get here which may be an hour and
now okay um I might being with al Qaeda
would mean obvious
I want me to come out of my parents
place I'll text you their address
because more than likely will be out
there okay no it's just some yeah
message just when you're close by thank
you Gary no expect right there hi that
was probably the weirdest bogan voice
I've put on actually didn't practice
before I did that business hey yeah I
saw your ad on gumtree yeah fully ad on
gumtree for a GTX 670 yeah we got the 69
fifty four forty Australian dollars
which I'm not too sure if that's a good
deal or not actually think it's a pretty
bad deal off the top of my head so even
if we don't leave the grammar scarred I
can still do a pretty cool video on it
I'm pretty sure a lot of people would
still be interesting to see how a card
like that performed in maybe today's
title and Jerry was actually a really
nice job but you guys it's time to go
jump in the F 'mobile and go pick up
some of these deals and they're a little
bit farther about a 30 40 minute drive
but it doesn't matter because I got a
full tank I'm ready
PC here this is the HP 3300 because it's
for 140 AUD now I've put the gtx 750ti
low-profile graphics card in there
actually had to change it around the
bracket so this model is a little thin
one so it fits in perfectly however
there is a little bit of problem at the
moment it does boot up but it boots up
very slowly so I've got to look into why
it's not booting up a hundred percent
but I will be making a dedicated video
for this because something like this is
just extremely good value for money I
mean you can pick up 750 Chios for
probably around 50 u.s. or 70 AUD
nowadays so they're going very cheap I
don't know if you can get a low-profile
one like this they're probably a little
bit more rarer but this one just runs
off the PCIe power so it's really not
drawing much parallel I'd probably will
have to take it out under volt the CPU
and the memory and turn off all things
that I'm not using just so there's a
little bit extra power available I've
already unplugged the DVD drive and yet
hopefully I can get this thing working
perfectly and test it in some games at
1080p now here we've got the 69 50 now I
believe these can be flashed to a 69 70
so I'm going to look into that
we've got this 440 AUD I wanted to pay
30 84 but the guy was really nice I even
met him in person really cool guy so
that is a pretty decent card for the
money hopefully I can do some testing
with one gigabyte of VRAM and see if
that is enough for today's games I also
got sent in a B 350 and an X 370
motherboard from asrock these are their
mini ATX motherboards now I'm not too
sure what the difference is between the
B 350 in the X 370 I believe this one
has extra features in the boss like load
line calibration support as opposed to
the B 350 which doesn't have it so I'll
be doing a full comparison once I know
the differences to will you for what
it's worth
that'd be 350 is a real sweet spot
especially on a mini ATX board where you
don't get the extra USB ports because
it's simply such a small motherboard and
there's no extra room to put those USB
ports on there also Kouga sent in their
headset this is the immersive pro and
their open air sort of hybrid
case called the Conca now I really like
these cases because in the past I've had
the era cool I think the strike EXO
something and that was pretty cool but
it was really big totally this one is
really good it does look good just from
looking at it in the box and let me know
if there's anything specific that you
want me to test in this case and I'll
make sure I get it done so another thing
I got asked a lot about in the comments
was how do I search for these deals what
goes through my head when I'm looking
for products and how do I know what
things are worth so big hint for you
guys if you're in the market for a
graphics card especially look up the
five strike GPU score that'll tell you a
lot it's actually my favorite score when
it comes to looking how a graphics card
performs even modern day gravis cards
like a 1080 TI 1070 or even the newly
released Vega six before value 56 with
those graphics cards I look at the fire
strike GPU scores straight away but
we're going to give you an average of
how this graphics card will perform in
games now with that you can correlate
that graphics card score to the price so
for instance with those 662 eyes that I
picked up the other time in the last
bargain hunter that I did here I got
them for $60 or 60 Australian dollars a
pop it should be around 40 something USD
which is extremely cheap providing they
get around about I think a grab a score
of like 7000 which is so good for the
money and considering a gtx 750ti for
example gets around 8,000 in this
benchmark it should give you an
indicator on how good value for money
you are getting when you're buying a new
graphics card and with that said on the
website check CD TV I'll put an article
up for you guys where I put the GPUs and
their associated fire strike score so if
you're in the market for a graphics card
then all you have to do is look up this
fire strike GPU score and you'll get a
rough idea of how strong that grants
card is also put the scores on what I
believe is perfect for what resolution
for instance the 1050 Ti when it scores
8,000 I think that is perfectly fine for
1080p gaming at high settings a 1070 for
example that scores around 20,000 points
in fire strike massive improvement over
a 1050 Ti for example that'll be good
for 1440p high and even ultra gaming now
with the 1080i that scores a whopping 32
Plus and that's why this card is fine
for 4k 60 Hertz gaming in my opinion now
there's a little bit more involved with
that especially with the vram and also
the ROPS and other specs on the graphics
card so that should give you a rough
indicator of what resolutions these
graphics cards are good for and also
what framerate and on that note as well
the same thing goes for the physics core
and fire strike very useful figure to
the CPUs I usually tend to use Cinebench
because it's just so easy to get a quick
score and especially with a lot of the
you CPUs that I'm dealing with they
don't have many cores or many threads so
the center bench score for those low
core count low threaten CPUs is much
more relevant especially for gaming than
say something with a lot of cause for
instance 8 or even 16 core jewelry on
that I've done in the past and also here
is the giveaway PC now I was
overclocking this a little bit last
night I go to the three point nine five
gigahertz tested it for eight hours so
it's completely stable and also in
Cinebench its scoring pretty high I
believe near 800 Cinebench point in the
3d marks fire strike overclock the
graphics card that's 1050 T I got that -
a GPU score of 8000 and also m5 strike
the CPU the 1500 X gets 13,000 physics
and vice right now when I did the games
test pop G ran really well at high
settings 1080p so people going to have a
great time on this absolutely smooth I
got a lot of kills in the game that I
played and also overwatch over a hundred
FPS at all times really great PC for
those people who want to play some
competitive online multiplayer titles
even tested dota 2 really good again and
then of course f1 2016 which is a really
easy benchmark to do this thing was
performing phenomenally well hello guys
hope you enjoyed today's video and if
you did then be sure to hit that like
button and let me know in the comments
section below what was your favorite
part of today's vlog I mean man that
hundred and forty AUD PC was really good
value for money now you couple that with
a 750ti which has also going pretty
cheap nowadays put a low profile bracket
on there whack it in you've got yourself
an extremely cheap gaming PC for 1080p
even in this cryptocurrency mining boom
so you can still pick up those deals
you just gotta as always hunt for them
beyond your hustle game and with that
said the giveaway PC another
all days left enter I'm teaming up with
hardware unbox and also a science studio
they've given away their own PC to
internationally we're going to announce
the winners on Twitter and Facebook
we may even do a special live for you
guys and announce the winners on that
too massive giveaway free to enter make
sure you get in with the chance big
thank you to you guys for supporting all
our channel and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
oh and I know you guys wouldn't forgive
me if I didn't test this out so we're
going to turn this thing on and see if
we got hosed or not now we didn't get
hoes guys whoo
okay graphics card that works perfectly
fine so one of the guys in the comments
said they would dislike the video if you
were not in it what do you have to say
