booth and now today they are making a
huge push on their desktop PC so we're
going to take a look at that we might
even take a look at a few of their
latest and greatest laptops on display
and see if they really are console
killers 2017 Computex coverage for tech
yes Cydia is brought to you by MSI and
course spam for a limited time only you
can get a free copy of Ghost Recon
wildlands luxe provision with any
purchase of an MSI product click the
link in description below to find out
more so here we are I'm joined by Ed how
you doing man that's great on you yeah
really good so we're looking at a
console killer here on display at the
MSI booth this is a Trident 3 now there
is a special edition the concept right
this is the Ironman of Edition right
yeah I remember and for this one
oh we are designed for the contacts only
by the wheel gather feedback if Lefevre
as well and we will try to produce it
then we have it guys let us know if you
think this design looks awesome what
colors would you want to see drop it in
a comment in the comment section below
but talking about aspects to this thing
we're looking like we've got an i7 7700
a mini ITX motherboard and you can also
choose between a gtx 1070 or a 1060 mini
edition and it all fits in a really
small form-factor we're talking smaller
than the ps4 incredibly small and of
course the airflow is there with two
separate chambers right yes and this
official we call it is the silenced on
cooling and it's RMS is causes of
features we want to make sure that small
compared PC with smooth airflow so we
design for a separate chamber for low
CPU and a GPU okay so it's really smooth
pretty much smooth as it gets and you've
also using laptop memory in this model
yeah yeah yeah because we want to fit in
our in a small or traces so we use a
laptop composite the performance is
almost understand so there it is guys
all about the form factor of course the
pricing though is a little bit expensive
we're looking at one thousand dollars
and ninety nine for the 1060 Edition but
also it was at 1499 for the 1070 model
yes yes for the white one is running
three optics we use the 1070 as all
upfront about me more higher of course
with that guys it will absolutely kill
the performance
of a console right yeah and you can see
so counselor so now I'm joined by Ed
again and we are over at the infinite a
gaming desktop which is an all-in-one to
hit the shelves from combi Tech yeah
yeah yeah it's just long to build a
circle okay so now I'm checking out the
specs we've got a 7700 in here and also
we're looking at all pretty much MSI
components except for what is not MSI
component in here there's a third house
right the hard drives and also the power
supply is done by jelsa so it's a really
good power supply they're throwing in
this thing the case as well is an
in-house design from MSI - it's all
designed by MSI we produce it for this
chances yeah it's really nice so we go
get a GTX 1080 as well so really good
performance 64 gigabytes of RAM right
yeah yeah oh it's a bowl of false lights
follow a ram okay so that's coming out
of one seven nine nine and this thing
out of the box should be able to do
gaming and video editing and everything
you need it to for the price though it's
really not bad for someone looking for
an all in one who doesn't overclock and
wants no problems because the design is
pretty good too with air flow right yeah
yeah of course we have a separate
chamber for the air flow and we also use
a vertical VGA which we also MSI design
VGA came in graphics performance we
pretty well even thrown in an in-house
cooler as well and MSI exclusive design
on the air cooler for the CPU yeah of
course yeah well there it is guys the
infinite a gaming guest up it looks
awesome and it will perform awesome as
well and also thanks for your time I
don't want thank you dear mmm so a new
QB coming out in Computex is the QB 3 so
I know a lot of you guys out there doing
business definitely like the size and
the power factor of these little bad
boys and they can definitely do a lot
for how small they are this is a full
aluminium construction and it can
support up to 32 gigabytes of ddr4
memory and of course it's a fan 'less
design so it's going to be very open
extremely quiet and it's going to use
that on board a GPU with the seventh gen
Cabul aq CPUs which essentially laptops
CPUs and the last desktop on display is
the aigis ti3 which is an all-in-one PC
from MSI
where you can have essentially up to two
gtx 10a DTI in sli and both whiskey k
water blocks on them and there's also a
7700 k in this model which also has
custom water-cooled so a lot of you guys
out there who want to get into that full
custom enthusiasts water loop them on
performance from that however don't have
the experience to build a custom water
salute can get an egg at CI three and
start happily overclocking and also on
display at the msi booth was their
laptops and actually went to a
presentation and also me not being much
of a laptop person the one thing that
really struck out to me was the max-q
design and this is where they can put
gtx 1070 and also 1080s into a very slim
profile laptop so not only will you get
a small form-factor with a laptop you
can now have that high performance
coming in to various different laptops
to hit the shelves and that about wraps
up the msi booth for Computex 2017 i
hope you guys had a very cool time with
all the videos that i've done across
here and if you have any questions or
comments about anything during Computex
or any videos going forward with
requests then be sure to drop a comment
in the comment section below and i'll
