builds high end builds keyboard reviews
headphone reviews you're like damn brain
I need a new fix surely you can't
provide us with something well today you
guys I have a new fix for you we're
gonna be silicon gunning or essentially
gluing down a CPU to a motherboard and
seeing if the temperatures are any
different to that of a massive cool of
the reven akeno's and also a budget cool
of the tx3 so let's get this comparison
underway welcome back to tech yes City
this brand coming to you guys today with
a video on three different CPU coolers
and one of them is going to be glued
down to the motherboard that's right we
blowing this thing down for a pure price
performance now pick this CPU a cooler
up for around about $4 in a junk on a
long time ago and now sometimes you get
these really good coolers but they don't
have the mounting kits and that's
exactly the case here so we're gonna try
and get the best price performance
possible by silicon gunning it down to
the motherboard and now this won't
really work with the PG a socket unless
you do it around the edges but in this
case we've got an LGA board and so
essentially the CPU and the socket is
going to be holding the cooler together
and with that it shouldn't come apart
well hopefully I mean with the
temperature tests that we do later on
we're gonna check out if it does indeed
work now we've got some competitors here
the reven akeno's this thing is massive
to fans it's got a mounting kit as well
so we're gonna see this is the Big Daddy
this is gonna be like the one to compare
it to and then of course I've thrown in
the cooler master TX three as well which
is an entry-level CPU cooler just to see
how this big sis ninja or Kabuto I
forgot the exact name of it compares to
these other two coolers now with that
aside some of the other parts that we're
using is an ex 34:30 which is a twelve
dollar CPU or File Express four cores
four threads and it's overclockable and
we've got a H fifty-five motherboard
that I picked up in a used parts hunt
over in Thailand so all these parts are
extreme budget and hence the reason for
getting the price performance down by
doing what I'm doing here today
those that aside let's get on to all the
testing
so just finish two rounds of testing now
with the TX three and now the reven
cooler and the reven cooler did do a lot
better than the TX 3
however I would have taken the CPU to
3.8 gigahertz and I did get it to 3.0 he
goes but it's really not sustainable on
this motherboard as even dropping it
down to 3.6 gigahertz
after 10 minutes show that the vrm is on
the MOSFETs we're measuring in at 68
degrees from an IR gun and that's really
hot even the chokes when I was touching
them they were getting extremely hot too
so something like this motherboard isn't
geared up towards overclocking that much
so 3.6 gibbets is a happy medium and
even then it was putting out that CPU
I'd have to guesstimate around about 70
watts so the CPU is running a little bit
hot even at 3.6 gigahertz
I'll try fine-tune that but for the
apples to apples to apples' s it's
actually a pretty good number you can
see that this cooler even though it's
massive it is doing a better job in this
cooler but now it's time to whack on the
silicon gun cooler and then get the
final results for you guys
and we've just silicon gunned now the
CPU down so it's still got a bond and
that usually takes a few hours at least
with the clear silicon that I use but
once it's bonded it is very strong you
see here I'm using the rmx-1000 watt
power supply just as sort of like extra
weight to give it a bit of pressure and
make sure it's making good contact and
we're gonna come back to this thing in
the morning and see how it runs and it's
now morning time and the silicon is all
dry and we should be able to pick the
motherboard up off the box and it should
be very firm which it is and so now
we're just gonna install a 140 mm fan on
top of this cooler and we can see here
we want to install it this way so the
vrm actually gets some of the cooling
off this fan - so we're gonna silicon
this down as well because wise will
silicon everything down if we're doing
the silicon job
the results are in and here we have the
silicon gunned sis cooler scoring right
as expected in my opinion at scored
right in between the Riva and the TX
three more closer to the TX three but
the reven is a massive cooler it does
have a really good mounting kit that
does bolt it down pretty firmly the
silicon gun cool obviously not being
bolted down as best as it could but it
did score a victory over the TX 3 which
was good to see and it could handle the
heat so I'm really impressed with the
results of course this is gonna save us
a few dollars and the price performance
is gonna go up even more but the biggest
thing I like about this of course is
that top down fan now that's gonna give
the vrm some cooling it's not gonna be
amazing but it is gonna give it a little
bit more cooling as opposed to one of
the other two solutions that we had on
the test bench now you may be wondering
why didn't you go out and make a custom
frame or zip ties as I said before with
zip ties they will get loose over time
or at least in my experience and also
with a custom frame I mean guys its a
four-dollar cooler I'm not really gonna
waste that much time and go to all those
lengths just for a four dollar cooler
but with that the silicon gun it is
extremely fast of course you do have a
lot of down time waiting for the cooler
to stick but in terms of the actual work
that needs to be done it's a really
quick fix it will save you some money
just keep in mind that you will want to
sort of put some pressure on the cooler
to make sure that the cooler does make
good contact with the CPU and so the
silicon actually sticks properly though
before you get on out of here one thing
to keep in mind is that this is a
permanent solution so if you do decide
to do this just keep in mind that you
may have not only a very aesthetically
bad-looking motherboard and CPU combo
but you will have a permanently attached
solution in that if you try to rip the
cooler off especially if you try to
twist it off and use brute force you may
damage some hardware in the process if
you use a stanley knife you may get
better results you just have to get some
of the silicon left over off but I want
to see for what it's worth it was a big
success again bringing that price
performance up through the roof
$4 cooler $12 CPU $30 motherboards so
there really isn't a lot to lose and how
does it perform in games well that is a
another topic for another video coming
very soon for you guys to stay tuned for
that and if you like this video then be
sure to hit that like button and let me
know in the comments section below
what you think of today's fix and I'll
catch you in another one very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
