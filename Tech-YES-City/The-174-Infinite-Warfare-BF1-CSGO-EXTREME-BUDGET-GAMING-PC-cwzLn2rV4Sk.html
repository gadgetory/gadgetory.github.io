the best value for money PC that I've
built to date not only that it can play
the latest titles at 1440p 60fps on
multiplayer
welcome back to tech city this is Brad
coming to you guys today with a very
very hot build this one I managed to do
when I was actually doing a guide for
how I hustle with used parts and I
stumbled on the two really awesome deals
the first deal was an all-in-one PC with
an i-5 2400 which is a four core CPU
the second deal was a 7970 but with that
being said let's look at the prices of
these parts and then we'll do the build
and then we'll go straight on to the
benchmarks
Oh
Oh
so we've pulled this whole graphics card
cooler apart and now we're replacing the
thermal pads because are really old and
just sticky now virtually useless some
of that the thermal paste is going
really hard and crummy so we're going to
place that too and then we should
hopefully have a graphics card just
looking brandon's
only by frozen memories
yes
yeah yeah
you
you
so there we have it guys the benchmark
showed just how damn epic this PC is I
mean for 175 USD or 235 AUD this thing
is just screaming it can play those
games infinite warfare battlefield one
at 1440p on multiplayer so hopefully
this puts down the naysayers that say
you know these used old parts can't get
up and boogie and they can we're talking
1440p over 60 frames per second on all
these three titles I tested here the one
thing I will point out is that I did
tweak all three games and things like
shadows and shadow detail I drop those
kind of details as I feel like they just
caused a lot of stuttering in games and
they also reduced performance but when I
turn these off I still had or turn these
on to low I still had a picture that was
gorgeous and also the games just played
so incredibly smooth a 1440p I mean
we're talking a PC here that costs less
than a GTX 1060 brain you that's the
whole thing we're talking the
motherboard the RAM the CPU the CPU
cooler the graphics card the power
supply you know it's just going out of
control here and if I'm not getting too
far off topic here I did have to clean
up some of these parts especially the
graphs card that had some really old
thermal pads on there and some old
thermal paste on there but once it
changed it was able to overclock to a
pretty decent overclocked tools pretty
happy with the overclock almost got to
1.1 gigahertz though I did want to keep
it pretty cool as the ambient
temperatures here are pretty hot at the
moment we're talking like 28 degrees at
the moment in this very room but with
all that aside I hope you guys enjoyed
this build and also if you want to pick
up a copy of infinite warfare then it's
going really damn cheap on CD keys calm
I'll put the link in the description
below it doesn't like I paid like 32
Australian dollars for this game
insanely cheap for a triple-a title has
just been released and the campaign
admittedly is pretty fun also another
big announcement is the forum is finally
up and running so if you guys want to
head over to tech city TV and check out
the website you're more than welcome to
do so and also slash forum will allow
you to go to the forum and discuss
things Tech and PC gaming without said
I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon and don't forget to hit
that like button if you like the build
and all things tech peace out for now
bye
imagine this with the tech world going
crazy over a gtx 1060 or an RX 470 i
myself here have built a whole PC for
that money they can play titles in 1440p
are you freaking kidding me do I look
like I'm freaking kidding you you're
gonna go buy a GTX 1060 for $200 but
then you were like nah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
