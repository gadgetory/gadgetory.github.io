PC that is going to be put together with
all these random parts we've got this
ASA board right over here on a deal we
got it for 85 Aussie dollars came with a
gigabytes of RAM and i3 and also the
motherboard which is really good in this
case the Acer om boards you don't need
any proprietary connector converters or
anything like that it will work straight
with a normal power supply which is gold
we've been putting an i7 870 in that
since the specs on Forza 4 say minimum
requires an i5 750 or 760 so we should
be absolutely fine we're gonna use that
included cooler as well since back in
this generation they did get it right in
terms of implementing stock coolers that
could handle the heat literally then we
got here we got a brand new absolutely
huge 1 terabyte hard drive and then
we've got the r9 290x this thing we
picked this up on a deal actually quite
a few months ago for around about 160
Aussie dollars so it's a beast of a card
it will need a big power supply to power
that so we do have the 800 watt
Thermaltake tr2 that we pulled out of
another build and in this case right
here instead of throwing it in the bin I
figured I'll repurpose it since we do
have a micro ATX board and it is sort of
like a reverse style case so will be
very interesting to see how this bill
comes out but without a side let's get
building and then testing Forza 4
but wait Larry there's more
so we finished the PC and of course
we've spiced it up a little bit
always with the potatoes they do get an
extra bit of tech yes loving than the
normal builds that go on around here
around the channel and the good thing
about Forza horizon for booted up it's a
really exciting game and there's there's
a little problem though before we even
talk about the benchmark numbers we
tried booting it up with a 290x with the
newest drivers installed and because
there's some issue with the overlay and
the game inherently has Xbox overlay
installed they can flick with each other
so we're actually using a default driver
for the r9 290x and we can't find a
workaround at the moment around this
because I'd like to get some driver
updates instead of using an archaic
driver and see if you can get some more
FPS but with that said the 290x actually
does a really good job of running this
game we're talking 1440p high settings
at 59 fps so it's pretty much right at
that sweet spot of 60fps if you want to
play and use this thing at 1440p 1080p
was even better scoring near 80 FPS on
medium settings and then high settings
with 68 FPS so this CPU and GPU
especially for this game is actually a
pretty magical combo that will run it
really well so here's a PC it's complete
here but you may notice something a
little bit odd about this case and that
is it's kind of upside down I guess you
could call it a case that was designed
for aussies but on the flip side of
things this is actually the funny thing
about these cases
Yussef as well the video editor around
tokyo city here's one of these cases as
well they kind of like normally this way
but they're upside down and I think
rumor has it that once upon a time until
wanted to push these cases because they
wanted to make BTX more mainstream and I
guess it just never came to fruition
that's like a rumor going around I've
got no idea because nowadays these cases
just aren't anywhere to be found
brand-new sort of like a dead meme at
this point and yes I am aware of this
power supply having way too many cables
but do not fear still bet in the verge
now one of my friends is into PC gaming
and he has a
racing simulator so we're gonna be using
this to play Forza horizon 4 on this
budget PC I've heard you're not gonna
get the best experience until you've
tried it on a racing simulator so let's
give this thing a test drive
so we just finished playing on the
racing simulator and it was such a good
experience but honestly with this game
it doesn't matter if you're playing on a
controller or a mouse and keyboard or
the racing sim all three devices are
going to give you one phenomenal
experience and the best thing is this
three hundred and forty dollar PC that
we put it does play it really well on
1080p high settings if you're in the US
it'll set you back around two hundred
and forty five US dollar II dues and the
online 290x that thing held up
absolutely fine 1080p high settings as
we mentioned before but even 1440p high
settings was doable
if we moved into 4k we're getting around
30 fps so I mean if you like 30 fps then
this thing for the price can still do it
now the game itself does cost a little
bit of money at least in Australia
seventy-seven Aussie dollars so it is
quite an ask but it's definitely one of
the more enjoyable games that has come
out in 2018 it's really polished it's
started free and the best thing is you
can play it on older hardware as well
and still get a really good experience
the i7 817 that fork or a threaded first
gen Intel CPU with no overclocks by the
way because we're running an ASA
motherboard that we picked up for a real
good bargain is still handling this game
as we saw in those benchmark results
absolutely fine but it all said and done
you can get away with putting together
something super cheap that'll give you a
great experience with Forza horizon
before and also with this PC we did
spice it up a little bit but we do have
to leave the side panel on since the r9
290x is a power-hungry graphics card and
the fan noises they kind of have to
remain a little bit noisy because the
cards are power-hungry card and it's got
a triple slot solution so not much you
can do about that I would like to
instead use like an Rx 580 or a GTX 1060
or something like that but then today
the r9 290x is still a phenomenal card
that will play games in 2018 absolutely
fine hope you guys enjoyed this video if
you did then be sure to hit that like
button and let us know in the comment
section below
have you tried forza horizon for
yet if you have what are you playing it
on console or PC and if you play it on
PC let me know your experience are you
getting any stuttering or have you got
to work around for this driver issue
that we experienced here today love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always if you enjoy the content you
might want to consider subscribing to
take your city we got some more hot tech
videos coming to you very soon peace out
for now bye no you're not you're not
getting the light I'm getting the light
stay away those are for so good even a
moth will want to drive this thing
