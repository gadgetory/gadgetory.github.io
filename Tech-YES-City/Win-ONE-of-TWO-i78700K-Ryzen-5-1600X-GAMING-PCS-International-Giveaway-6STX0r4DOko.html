you love a good giveaway sets around
teaming up with three of the tech
channels in my opinion these are three
of the best tech channels out there
we're teaming up to give you guys two
fully built pcs and there's also two
extra prizes for the runners-up as well
so for winners in total international
giveaway so let's get on with the prizes
we've got here first stop Steve and I
we're gonna be building a Rison system
1600 X GTX 1060 and we're putting this
in a fan Tex and through silver case now
also were thrown in some custom white
cables there's gonna be 16 gigabytes of
ddr4 memory which is very expensive
nowadays it's also an SSD and there's
also going to be some RGB lighting with
this provided by the deep cool guy max
240 RGB liquid cooler so not only you
got to get really cool temps and a
really good look but you're gonna get
some really good performance especially
at 1080p gaming and this VC of course
will be overclocked by Steve before it
ships it out so this first piece if you
were to go out and get all the
components yourself and build it it cost
around 1900 Australian dollars or if
you're in the US around about 1400 US
dollars very expensive now the second
bill we'll get up here is from the guys
in the US level one tax and tech deals
they're teaming up to bring in an 8700 K
gaming rig not only that the motherboard
on this thing is the MSA Z 370 God light
gaming this is a really expensive
motherboard and they're chucking on a
gtx 1070 and 16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory
and an nvme SSD drive so this thing is
going to be crazy you've also got the
corsair h 100 IV - a corsair 400 r
carbide case and of course an r MX gold
rated power supply so this thing is also
going to have the grunt to match its
looks so now what you have to do to
enter is click on the link in the
description below there's more ways you
can get entries as well it's completely
free international giveaway and a big
thanks to the other three channels tech
deals hardware unboxed and also level 1
text i'll put their channel links in the
description below too because in this
tough time of youtube with the d
monetization z' and views going all over
the place it's really good that we can
team up together i've met wendell level
one techs in real life he's a really
nice guy he and his crew have a really
good channel where they've got such good
knowledge in things like virtual
machines linux and programming they're
really knowledgeable and then of
tech deals as his name states this guy
hunts the deals all the time especially
on the new parts I'd liked one day to
challenge tech deals and sort of like a
yes deals see what we could do for you
guys live and of course my good friend
Steve from hardware unboxed his down in
Melbourne in Australia he does really
good benchmarking especially when the
new products are launched he goes very
in-depth and gets you guys the best
