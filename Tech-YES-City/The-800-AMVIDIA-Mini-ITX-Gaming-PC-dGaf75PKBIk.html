Rison 3 1200 and 1300 X and they are
great DB use if you want to overclock
them and today we have a mini ITX build
that one cost too much more than a
regular build especially a cookie-cutter
build and of course you get that small
form-factor awesome performance and I've
even thrown in some extra options if you
want to save even more cash happy days
welcome back to tech yes cities is brand
coming to you guys today with a mini ITX
build and we're using the Ragin tech
Metis which is a $63 all aluminium
constructed case it actually includes a
fan 2 very small very easy to work with
though it does have a few caveats and we
will talk about that a little bit later
after we did some benchmarking and
temperature tests though as for the
other parts we've got 8 gigabytes of RAM
from crucial this is their new 3200
brand and it cost around $100 though the
good thing with Verizon is the 32
hundred megahertz XMP profiles works
perfectly on both boards that I've
tested here so if you want to get the
most performance out of your eyes and
chips then this memory is certainly
recommended those for the graphics card
we've gone with the GTX 1060 mini this
is a three gigabyte edition they're
actually coming back into stock and the
prices aren't too ridiculous the one
that I've got here cost around about 225
USD so if you do want to save some money
of course you can it go with the gtx
750ti
a same mini edition this will set you
back around about a hundred and forty
five dollars so if you don't need to
promise out of the ten sixty then you
can save a bit of money and go with that
temper TTI though as for the cpu I just
recently reviewed this this is the risin
312 hundred one hundred and nine dollars
includes the cooler and the great thing
is you can overclock these pretty high
even in this mini ITX build today with
restricted airflow I managed to get it
up to 3.9 gigahertz which at these
speeds it performs phenomenally well as
we'll see pretty soon though for the
Mini ITX motherboard on the rise in
series we go with the big 350 fatality
from asrock great motherboard for the
money comes in a
115 dollars you get included Wi-Fi as
well which is why I went with this board
over the Biostar and of course the as
rock bass is very easy to work with it's
very easy to overclock with and I'll be
doing my overclocking tutorial with this
motherboard and then for the storage
we're going with an MX 300 from crucial
this is a 575 gigabyte model coming
around about 150 USD so if you do want
to save money and you're on a strict
budget then you can get a one terabyte
7200 rpm small 2.5 inch hard disk drive
for around about 56 dollars so it's up
to you I have put in some options in the
description if you want to save some
money and then for the last component in
this bill we're going with a EVGA power
supply for $30 we'll have ample amount
of power to power the GTX 1060 and of
course the Rison 3 1200 went both the
overclocked and with that it is a full
sized ATX power supply however the case
we're using today allows you to fit in a
full sized ATX power supply and still
have ample room to work with and what
was that said let's take a look at how
this thing performs and now with the CPU
I managed to get it up as I said before
to 3.9 Giga on the core the graphics
card I also managed to squeeze out an
extra hundred mega that's on the core
and about 350 megahertz on the memory so
with that said roll those benchmarks
so first things first with those
benchmarks you can see that this thing
performs phenomenally well that's
because they overclocked my gear and I
know I stress this a lot but seriously
guys start overclocking your stuff the
performance gains are huge and you paid
nothing for those performance gains
they're absolutely free and with that we
saw dota 2 I was playing a very heavy
intense multiplayer match absolutely no
dips below 100 FPS
at all times even in big battles I was
really surprised great if you don't want
any choking while you're trying to get
those clutch plays and then of course f1
2016 again over 100 FPS though did dip
down to the minimum of 80 FPS but at all
times it was ridiculously smooth and
then fallout 4 I did break the vsync
limit on this and of course we're over a
hundred FPS at all times
1080p high settings csgo again over 200
FPS great for those clutch plays if you
want high smooth fps and the last game
we tested pub G of course very popular
title people want to play this game all
the time one of the fastest growing
games and it hasn't even been officially
released yet we were getting over 50 FPS
at all times have a one thing to
remember with pub gear one thing that
I've actually noticed after doing a lot
of testing on it is it does depend on
the server you're on if you're on a bad
server then you will get some really bad
spikes and this isn't the fault of your
own hardware it's actually the fault of
the person hosting the server or the
company hosting the server now it's time
to talk a little bit more about the
hardware itself usually in the past if
you go with the Mini ITX build you
usually end up paying a premium
especially over cookie-cutter build over
in this case or like all pun intended
the region tech Metis isn't that
expensive $63 case and it allows you to
use a full sized ATX case and of course
the graphics cards the minis are usually
the cheapest option and of course it's
got ample room for a decent sized cooler
I believe up to 160 millimeters though
the rapes self that's included with the
rise of three is plenty enough however
with all the good parts aside I mean
this case was very easy to work with
ample room to install things it wasn't a
problem at all some of the problems with
this build however is the air
flow in this case the included side
panel actually had to switch sides
because it blocked airflow so much and
you may want to do this you may even
want to take off that clear side panel
if you want the best airflow possible
however I do notice a problem with
temperatures and that's why in my review
I reviewed rising 3 at 4 gigahertz but
in this case I had to down clock it to
3.9 gigas with 40 millivolts less
otherwise it was just getting too hot to
handle the machine would switch off also
another problem with the region tech
medicines the feet included now I've
only traveled with this case once I
brought it from Japan to Australia and
I've already lost the foot on the bottom
I've actually had to go on superglue the
one of the feet on the corners in the
middle so now it's got three feet so if
you want to travel with this case you
may want to rethink your options and get
a different case that's a little bit
more sturdier especially when it comes
to the included feet
however those two negatives aside it is
actually a really good case for the
money it's got an all-metal construction
includes a fan and it's also very easy
to work with so I can recommend it just
don't go putting in too heavy hardware
in there like an ache or Rison for
example and a gtx 1070 mini i think
you'll have too much of a heat problem
on your hands or on your desk and of
course the last thing to talk about with
this build is it came to around $800
with the 1060 and also the SSD however I
did manage to drop it down to around
about 580 dollars if you wish to use
cheaper memory a gtx 750ti and also not
an SSD go with the one terabyte hard
drive so I have put some options in
there for you guys go check it out in
the description below but with current
cryptocurrency mining prices sending
graphics cards to insane levels ddr4
memory being overpriced it's actually
not a bad time to build if you get the
three gigabyte 1060 as I believe they're
being phased out in terms of popularity
for minors and also things like the
Rison 3 the SSDs and hard drives are
bringing decent value to the table so
you've just got to pick and choose your
parts but you can still build a decent
PC as of now it's just I think there's a
six gigabyte 10 60 s and also the 8
gigabyte 10 70s will be pretty popular
for quite some time due to their veer
and buffers popularity for
cryptocurrency mining unfortunately any
guys that's it for today I hope you
enjoyed today's and
any ITX verizon building if you did then
be sure to hit that like button and let
me know in the comment section below
would there be anything that you would
swap around love rating your comments as
always and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
bye
and I'm never going to break around you
it's like everything stops going by old
morning I've been doing some testing all
morning nothing and when I go to hit
that record button it's like Boop wormy
I'm flagging it a break ok welcome back</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
