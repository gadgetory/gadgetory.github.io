Taipei 101 actually I'm not in the
building I'm in Taiwan Taipei today
we're going to be used parts of log
hunting and I'm actually in the hotel
room oh so Millia breakfast and then
we're going to look around so this is
the drop is here that no one really
knows where these go use part
payments.that what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go to the place where they
sell the new pots and I say to the boys
then look where do I get the use pot
that so we're going to try and find
something in the end see if it works out
and you guys are going to become the men
and women who watch this whole journey
2017 Computex coverage in Taiwan was
brought to you by MSI and Corsair
bringing you the best in PC peripherals
and components click the link in the
description below to find out more about
current specials being offered by both
MSI and Corsair over the Computex period
so right now we are outside a place
called Guang Howell Plaza now I'm going
to go into this place and of course hunt
for those youth parts for you guys also
check out some of the new parts but I'm
more interested in getting some youth
price-performance and this is right in
the middle of Taipei as well so this is
my first time going here
this is like my literally my second day
in to being in Taiwan yesterday I pretty
much slept because they got a midnight
flight and I don't know hardly any
Chinese at all so let's see how this
goes wang hao is quite literally
epicenter of tech if you're in the
middle of type aid and this is the place
to go to shop for brand new tech all via
the prices surprisingly aren't that much
better than what you'd expect back at
home for instance in australia i could
probably pick up an SSD cheaper than
what i couldn't i won which is
surprising considering a lot of these
products are actually not just based in
here in the headquarters are here for
these companies but they're also
produced here so it is quite surprising
to see that prices are that cheap for
actual new technology here even with a
5% tax on board I still think the prices
could be a little bit better however as
for use parts I'm sure you guys were
wondering what
do as they asked around a quite a few
people and all they could come up with
is that you have to go online if you're
looking for use parts however I did arm
myself with a cheat sheet and I did
learn the word for used and so I just
went around for literally every store in
this district and it took me a long time
I was very tired went around every store
walked in and just said I'm looking for
use parts and anyway I ended up finding
two places in the end that had some used
parts to sale the guy had some stuff out
the back and he showed me the West and
what I had here was an A m3 motherboard
and a phenom six core processor and I
managed to pick this up for around about
50 US dollars and that is a bargain
especially even it came with the cooler
and then another store also had a fm2
motherboard with an old APU on it and I
asked this guy well how much do you want
for this and he said two dollars so I
immediately picked that up because he
said it was probably broken and I was
like what look I'm just going to test it
out anyway and I'm sure both the
motherboard and CPU aren't broken so
probably one of the two is broken so I
think that was a pretty good deal mind
you they did have an Intel H 55
motherboard packed with memory and an i7
870 and I said can I have this and he's
like he took a little bit and he said oh
you can have anything that been and then
he went and took the motherboard said no
you can't have this once he saw the i7
so a little bit devoted about that but I
did offer him $10 and he didn't take
and
so we just finished shopping at Guan
howell digital Plaza and it was pretty
good I'm pretty tired because I had to
hustle really hard the streets here they
mainly sell the new parts no one's
really selling used parts on the shelves
but as always no ASCII no Getty and I
was asking all these guys and two stores
did manage in the end to give me some
use parts so I'm going to show you guys
when we get back to the hotel what we've
got in these bags because one of the
deals that I got is really cool because
I've been looking for it for quite some
time and it's going to be awesome when I
put it into a build but let's get back
home to go now if you're coming to
Taipei it is a really good place
especially if you love food there's so
many different night markets and there's
also different places where you can eat
on pretty much every corner I did find a
few places close by that just made
amazing food and keep in mind you can
still go to chain restaurants like Moss
burger McDonald's KFC however I really
wasn't interested in eating any chain
food when I was over here and I'm glad I
didn't as some of the local food is just
absolutely fantastic I can highly
recommend it and it will only set you
back around about two or three dollars
and it just tastes that good now also if
you were going around transport for
taipei then i highly recommend you take
the trains and the buses or the sky
buses as the prices between them and a
taxi for example are just leagues
different if you catch the train it
literally cost you around a door so if
you do decide to catch a taxi it can
cost you pretty much what you're used to
paying back at home sold actually quite
surprised when i got a taxi from the
airport to my hotel and I love being
$50.00 of like wow that's quite
expensive even then I found out if I
took the air shuttle bus and a train
would have cost me
literally five bills that's just the tip
if you guys want to come you for a
holiday so we're now back at the hotel
and I've got all the parts here that
I've got from this hall now two of the
parts I actually managed to get when I
went into the BitFenix office and they
had some all parts laying around that
they said they were going to throw out
because they thought they didn't work so
I've got this graphics card here I
believe it's a gtx 770 might even be a
780 after they've got to pull it apart
and check and they just said it doesn't
work so I'm essentially going to test
this thing out see if it does work and
then we've got a the 87 motherboard here
now this board honestly it's got so many
bent pins I'm going to have a tough time
trying to get this thing to work but if
it does work there's going to be really
awesome and then of course we've got
those two parts that I've picked up at
the market for really good prices so I'm
hoping to see what I can make out of
this but honestly guys use parts hunting
is very challenging if you are in Taipei
it is extremely challenging to the point
where I was exhausted after I ran
through all those night markets trying
to get deals and people were kind of
like looking at me strange because I
guess buying used parts really isn't a
thing here I guess everyone likes to buy
new stuff kinda like Japan except
Japan's got those junkyard places and
they do make a little bit of money out
of doing things like this so it was a
great experience I really am enjoying
Taipei itself it's a great place to come
for you guys are thinking about a
holiday everything's really cool the
food to traveling here and some of the
places are really awesome too so I am
enjoying myself a little bit besides the
EU's past hunting as well I don't think
I'll be able to make a PC while I'm here
a whole youth PC I think
the question because they can actually
start filming for Computex soon so on
that note I did forget my microphone and
it was a dynamic microphone that I
forgot so I was actually out shopping
for microphones and the guy had five
different mics and I just said look that
one looks used what's the deal on it he
said oh it's like fifteen dollars
literally and so I said can I try that
compared to the $50 mic and he's like
yeah sure and I had one listen to this
used microphone and I thought it sounded
a heat better but anyway I'll switch
over to this microphone you guys can
have a quick lesson because this is the
kind of sound quality I'm going to be
giving you guys at Computex when I'm
doing the live one-on-one interviews so
here's a quick sound test on the audio
lapse microphone never heard of the
brand but hopefully it just works that's
all I'm hoping for and I'll be giving
you guys some Computex coverage in the
next couple of days and it's going to be
hard because my voice is already gone
and the event hasn't even started yet so
that's pretty crazy so if you guys have
a request as well let me know in the
comment section below as I'll be here
for the next week roughly and if you
have any special requests in there not
too crazy then I'll try and get them
done for you guys and also with the
giveaway for the monitors Steve and I
will be announcing the winner on Twitter
and we'll also be doing a live stream on
Twitch so I'll put the link in the
description below where you can check
out the details for that it will be
announced probably an hour beforehand so
stay tuned if you want to see us give
away these monitors live and I'll catch
you guys in another tech video very soon
and also if you enjoyed this one then be
sure to hit that like button as well and
yeah see you in the next tech video guys
peace out for now goodbye
