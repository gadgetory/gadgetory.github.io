been released on PC and it's running
smoother than ever this is a really
optimized Cod but on that note they are
going back to the original formula where
there's no people jumping off walls and
doing backflips like the previous cards
that have been released in the last
couple of years they're going back to
that original formula of just
straight-up Call of Duty awesome running
gun with that classical FPS feel and
today I've got a new PC for you guys
that will play it not only at 1080p with
really good frame rates but also even
play it at 4k and on top of that with
the new destiny 2 being released it does
go hand-in-hand with making a good
experience on both these two games as
they are awesome FPS titles also be
testing out pub G for you guys and
seeing how this PC performs in that game
too
welcome back to tech yeah City and today
we're using the 80 600 K which is the
latest i-5 with six cores six threads
now you can overclock this thing to
around about five gigahertz without even
D letting it now know your first
reaction is probably going to be
brighten this thing is not in stock
anywhere you can actually get it from
B&amp;amp;H photo on pre-order and they usually
get in stock all the time and they are
charging two hundred eighty dollars
which is a pretty fair price for this
CPU believe the retail is around two
hundred and sixty-five dollars so it's
not far off especially compared to some
other retails that are charging over
$300 for this CPU there's also the gtx
1070 TI now i recently reviewed the msi
variant it is really good you can
overclock this thing quite high and
you're going to be getting near GT x
1080 levels of performance now in games
when you also overclock the CPU you've
got a combination that will get really
high smooth FPS gameplay on high and
even ultra settings on a lot of titles
especially at 1080p you can even step it
up to 1440p or even 4k and destiny - and
also world war two now the possibly
using to cool down these components
we're using the H 55 from core sets a
120 millimeter budget water cooler comes
in at $60 really good value for money
and it'll also do a fine job of
overclocking the CPU to 5 gigahertz and
keeping it cool now you may be thinking
well 6 cores at 5 gigahertz that puts
out a lot of heat right the answer is
actually no this CPU only puts out
around 90 watts at 5 gigahertz which is
why the 8600 K in a lot of cases can be
a better alternative to the 8700 K yes
you do get those six cores 12 threads
but on the six core six threaded c4 you
I find that does use up a lot less power
with that this is less heat getting
dumped in your case less stress on the
vrm and you can also use a smaller
cooler and save some money continuing on
with the parts we're using the z 370 MSI
gaming Pro carbon a/c this has got
Wireless it's a really good variant of a
Z 370 motherboard this has a good vrm
good Nick good onboard audio and the
best thing about it is it's so easy to
overclock on this motherboard I will be
featuring this in an upcoming Z 370
comparison and I'll give you guys a
little early scoop on that comparison
the Z 370 from MSI here does really well
in that tests now for memory and storage
would only 16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory
this is
is one of the components that I'm not
too happy with in the build today
because of the pricing of ddr4 memory
$200 for this kit is very expensive and
with that said be on the lookout for a
good deal on memory itself for the SSD
we're going with the 120 gigabyte SSD
now most people want to go with 240 or
500 but me personally I'm finding games
are just so big nowadays you'll want to
get a massive amount of storage for your
backup and just use that to put on your
games which is why we're also going with
an SS HD 2 terabyte these come in at
$100 and with 2 terabytes you'll be able
to store plenty of games especially the
new destiny 2 it's around 50 gigabytes
the new card is around that too so
that's already taking up a lot of space
if you would have put it on an SSD now
housing all these components here today
is the spec o4 from Corsair and this
thing at $50 hits really hard in terms
of value for money you can get it in the
gray which is what we're using here
today or you get in the red or the
coarse a yellow and inside you've got a
lot of room to work with everything
installs with these cable management's
good you've got the clear side panel and
you also have two fans included to top
that off which in my tests did do a
pretty good job of cooling the maximum
temperatures with the side panel on
we're going around 70 degrees this is
with an overclock on both the GPU and
the CPU so even though they only include
two fans they do a great job of cooling
this 300 watts which was getting dumped
into this case and of course that
ventilation up the top allows the hot
air to blow out the top of the case as
well as the back and of course the last
component in today's build is the cx-5
50 M you get over 40 volts on the 12
volt line it's semi modular with all
black cables so it's pretty good power
supply for the money and of course with
today's components not being so
power-hungry does a great job of staying
cool even whilst powering these
components when they're overclocked
though with all that aside today's build
comes in at just over 1500 USD or if
you're in Australia just over 2100 a
strain and of course for my
budget-friendly viewers I do have a list
which comes in a lot cheaper and it
gives similar performance I'll put the
links in the description below for that
if you're just purely into gaming though
with that aside let's build this thing
start tuning and overclocking in and
then run into some games
they're like we talked about earlier in
this video obtaining an overclock at
five gigahertz on the Z 370 MSI
motherboard is extremely easy and also
when you go into Windows you can
download afterburner I'll put a link in
the description below you can overclock
your gratis card with ease by just
moving a few sliders and then of course
downloading the heaven UniGene benchmark
and testing out your overclock sin that
then without side let's take a look at
some gaming figures
so just like we saw in the benchmarks
they're the frame rates were not only
high but the 0.1% lows we're extremely
high - and this is gonna make for an
extremely smooth experience especially
at 1080p so if you've got a high refresh
rate monitor 144 Hertz or even higher
this CPU and this GPU in this case is
going to deliver some really good
numbers of course in Call of Duty World
War two taking a look at those figures
first the 1080p results were high 100's
all the time this was a really smooth
experience with high graphics settings
you can see the CPU and the GPU were
both being utilized really well and then
we stepped it up to 4k it was still a
good experience even though the frame
rates were a bit lower everything was
extremely smooth and like I said earlier
in the intro they've done a good job of
making Cod optimized for PC this time
around also the next game we're moving
into was destiny - and this is where
things are really smooth as well for PC
users Activision have done a good job of
making sure this title will play well on
PC with high frame rates of 1080p and
also even stepping up into 4k high
settings now me personally I'm a high
settings gamer I always turn my settings
down from ultra to high I believe the
extra framerate boots you get is just
phenomenal and the visual quality
differences aren't that much a lot of
tech tubers out there have done videos
comparing ultra and high and they
virtually couldn't find any difference
in graphical quality on a lot of titles
but with that they did find a massive
drop in frame rates so for a lot of the
games here I'm using high settings and
the frame rates are really high even at
4k like I said in destiny 2 we're
getting over 60fps most the time however
the last title was pub G that I cited
the test today and a 1080p it did
extremely well
scoring in around about a hundred to one
hundred and forty FPS most of the time
and then when we stepped it up to 4k
however the gtx 1070 TI was struggling a
bit this is a very graphically intensive
game especially at 4k so even at the low
settings it just wasn't the best
experience you would have to step it up
to a 10 80 TI if you wanted to play this
game at 4k which I honestly don't
recommend because the frame rates at
1080p are so smooth it's a really
enjoyable expect
so that we have a guys the call of duty
World War 2 PC looks very good has that
stealth look going for it and of course
the performance is there to match of
course you can save a bit of money like
I said earlier if you decide to change
the parts around so I'll put some links
in the description below and of course
everything here today worked extremely
well the installation was easy the
overclocking was easy and the
performance numbers were really good I
hope you guys enjoyed today's video and
if you did the be sure to hit that like
button and let me know in the comment
section below what would you do
differently love reading your thoughts
and opinions as always and also let me
know if you played the new Call of Duty
World War 2 if so what did you think
about it if not why haven't you played
it yet and I'll catch you guys in
another tag video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
