Rainbow six siege the multiplayer and
also answer those questions that isn't
smooth and secondly is it worth it
ladies gentlemen welcome back to check
yet city this is brad comma back to you
guys today with some gameplay footage of
the rainbow six multiplayer beta now
this game was free to play over the
weekend and I've spent a lot of hours on
it both solo and multiplayer with
friends and you'll probably notice the
Joker's in this game play as well so you
can go give him a big thumbs up and
you'll probably have his own review
ready in the next few days there this is
mainly my first impressions and I'm
going to answer those two questions as I
said in the intro on the first one is
this game smooth and I'm pleased to say
this game is very smooth I noticed no
stuttering at all even when the frames
were dropping to Lake as they are in
this video when I don't have my graphics
card overclocked i noticed that friends
were dropping 240fps 45 SBS and it was
still giving a really good experience so
the game is plenty well optimized for
the pc though on that note i will
quickly mention the graphics and they do
look a little bit dated i feel that they
could improve somewhat on the graphics
it feels like this is based off an old
engine from back in the yonder so I
would like to see some graphical
improvements if they were to make a
reiteration of this game in the future
though for what it's worth people who
are looking to play a bit of competitive
multiplayer on this game will thoroughly
enjoy the actual smoothness of the game
itself now we're going to move on to the
second question of is this game worth it
and that really depends on how you look
at this game I see it as a very tactical
style FPS where you can't really go Yolo
at all in this game so it really depends
on if you can play this game with
teammates or not because I found when I
was solo queuing this game it was very
boring and you pretty much died and
you're just waiting around for all your
teammates you don't even know to die and
they usually just go yo lo and it just
doesn't work you pretty much need a good
team and unique communication if you
want to win matches in this game so
that's very important as you can see
here there's a lot of camping based
strategies but regardless it is
strategies that will win you this game
now you generally got the attacking
phase and also the defending phase and
depending on the map you'll have to
either secure the building or diffuse
the bomb however on that note I will say
that the scope of the game is very small
this is in my opinion you pretty much
got different maps though the gameplay
itself is just generally repetitive and
the same even though is a lot of fun to
play with friends however on that note
of gameplay it is very unique and you
can do a lot of things in this game that
you just simply can't do in other FPS
for example you can barricade doors with
steel reinforcements or you can also
drop booby traps or barbed wire or if
you're the attackers you can get a class
called the thermite class and then you
can drop those steel reinforced doors
down so really there is a lot of
different actors that you can do in this
game and it's sort of what makes the
game very enjoyable and gives you a
different experience to what you're used
to with other kinds of FPS games
although personally I would like to see
more gameplay modes within this game as
I feel only having just one gameplay
mode itself kind of makes the game as i
said before repetitive and there is no
single player campaign even though there
is single-player matches which you can
just go up against a heap of terrorists
and get some practice there is actually
no campaign with a storyline and I would
have loved to have seen that in this
game I think it would have given me an
extra eight or so or ten hours of
gameplay that I could thoroughly enjoy
and so that leaves it to the final price
of what you can get it for now I believe
this game is going to cost thirty
dollars or at least that's what you can
pick it up for on CD keys com and so
thirty dollars it is a fair by though
personally I'm going to wait till it
drops down to maybe twenty dollars or
even cheaper as it's pretty much for me
it's a one purpose game even though it
is enjoyable and though you know the
game is very well optimized for pc i
found that it just doesn't have the
scope that some of the other games that
have been released lately do have so i
would have liked to have seen them just
adding more to the game and I would have
gladly paid the thirty dollars plus that
they're asking for this game however
lastly I will say that the game itself
does have its fair share of problems at
the moment people drop out randomly the
game does occasionally crash and also on
that note if a player does drop out they
then can't rejoin a team so if this
happens in a ranked match it can be very
detrimental to your rating so I would
like to see them implement a kind of
system where someone does drop out
whether it be through an internet drop
out of what not they could then get back
into the game with their team straight
away and start off where they dropped
out so that is one thing i really want
to see in this game though as it stands
the game is pretty smooth and i can
recommend it for someone looking for a
different experience with an FPS shooter
though just like Star Wars Battlefront I
will be waiting until this game comes
down a bit in price as I don't see
myself playing it that often especially
compared to some other games i have here
like legacy of the void and also fallout
4 also before I check on out of here I
will say that the game does have some
options in there like HBA 0 plus which
does affect your FPS quite considerably
I noticed when I turn this option on for
example and everything max at 4k I did
start to get a bit of stuttering there
and the game was starting to chunk in
performance so though from the get-go
soon as I opened up the game with the
recommended settings it did play very
smoothly which i will give you be soft
credit for considering other games that
have been released lately on PC have
been coming out even with those
recommended settings and they have been
playing like absolute dog crap so many
guys I would love to hear your thoughts
and opinions on this game are you going
to wait out until it gets a little bit
cheaper are you going to buy it or are
you not going to buy it at all please
