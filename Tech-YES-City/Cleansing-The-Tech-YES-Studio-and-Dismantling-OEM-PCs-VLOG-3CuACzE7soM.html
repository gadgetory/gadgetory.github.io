gamers we have here a rubbish pile
massive rubbish pile we've also got a
bill that's coming on the desk but today
we've also got a heap of stuff just
piled here on the floor some builds that
I'm gonna literally just cannibalize
pull all the good stuff out and see what
we've got left over because this place
is just a mess so today is like techy a
studio cleanse day where I've got to
give the studio itself that is the heart
and soul of tech yet City a cleanse so
let's get on
the first stop here we just got rubbish
pile this is just an absolute mess I
mean I just chuck things down here to
save time but we definitely have to
clean this up and get rid of the junk
so there's mess it's out the way we're
gonna vacuum that later we got these
boxes here if someone on the Gold Coast
wants them I mean I did get some
comments about people wanting to use
these displays sure just drop a comment
I can send you a DM and give you these
boxes but now we're on to this right
here these are some of the donated pcs
that I got I'm gonna cannibalize them
now because some of these cases are just
really off like this one here's got no
panels at all so I'm gonna sort of pull
out all the goodness out of these and
see what we've got
and yeah it's I mean the Dell cases 1050
s I can't find any use 1050 s at the
moment to chuck in there or use 10 30 s
so it's sort of like the matter at the
moment would just be to Paul the
goodness out of that and sort of chuck
away those old dell cases of course if
they got good power supplies I will keep
that as you saw in the five donated pcs
which is still there I'm gonna get on to
them once school holidays are over so I
can go into some of the schools and
we're all out of sight let's see what we
got on our hands here
so this is actually the first of the pcs
here it's actually the most interesting
you may have seen some I put some parts
with it I actually pulled this started
pulling this apart the other day it's a
Z 400 HP workstation but someone
actually left the the craziest thing is
someone left a 2 8 gigabyte sticks in
with 2 4 gigabyte sticks it was really
mismatched so that may have caused some
problems but regardless we're gonna pull
out the 16 gigabytes of ddr3 which is
absolute gold and we're gonna see what
processes in here pull this Quadro out
and see what grabs card we can put in
place because it's actually got a delta
pal supply already so it's really good
for putting together a budget piece in
the case actually looks pretty decent we
can cover that up there I made with like
an aura sticker or something make it
look like a custom case just for the
just with the flip
all right so everything's working now
it's booting into Windows just had to
initially go into the setup and then
change the boot drive to this solid
drive here and we've got ourselves a
gaming combo pack here with an RGB
keyboard and mouse so we're gonna put
that off the sale that is pretty much a
$70 PC because all we had to do was add
the graphics card in and also add a hard
drive and pulled out 16 gig of ram so
this was just an absolute win in terms
of this PC right here and this is people
just throw these things out all the time
they don't want them and it's incredible
what you can do with them with a bit of
TLC and even just an adapter there which
is taking two SATA ports to a 8 pin
because this power supply we see here it
can handle up to 456 watt on the 12 volt
line so this graphics card CPU will be
absolutely fine
so here was this Nvidia case this thing
is completely gutted like it's just got
no panels at all and just it looks so
bad to the point where I didn't even
know what I could do with this thing
except we did pull out some good
hardware here there's an i-5 35 and 70
in here or a 33 s actually 95 33 s there
was a gigabytes of RAM and also a water
cooler as well so not entirely sure if
this works at the moment but we're gonna
test that later but this case I just
want to get it out of here at the moment
so here's another one here we've pulled
out a gigabytes of ddr3 memory and also
this right here is a big big juicy
discovery in i7 3770 so that's really
nice
so with the leftovers again we can chuck
in to one gigabyte sticks of memory and
also say a Pentium and really you know
like a torrent pretty key hard drive and
we got ourselves a nice little office PC
so now guys every time we install a new
computer we test it out with the
benchmark called UniGene
so now it's just about to test this now
to 1964 and then I realize it's got a
dual core dual thread CP unit like I
don't even know these existed with x58
motherboard so we've now replaced it for
AI v 950 so I mean the AI the i-79 20s
and 950 is like no one wants them
anymore because they upgrade to Zeon's
and so yeah I've pretty much got a few
of them lying around that finally this
gaming combo is properly complete so now
we've got it the next PC and this is
really good too because this one had an
i-5 2400 which is always great for a
budget end gaming PC but this h61
motherboard is really nice and put an i7
in there 16 gigabytes of RAM I even came
with a 4 gigabyte stick and a deep I
know I started cool monster cooler
so that's really not bad at all and then
the gem here is a 700 watt Antec power
supplied service so that looks like it
has 630 what's available Wow quite a
beefy 12 volt line there so really good
score here the case of course probably
being actually the worst thing in this
build that's some really good parts
we've pulled out of that of course we
still have to test them so they'll go on
what I'm going to organise as the
untested shelf so next uh motherboard we
pulled out of this PC we actually picked
this up on the parts hunt and it's a LGA
775 with only two slots of memory but
the case looks ok we can definitely
reuse this case it's got a bit of a red
and black theme going on which people
always love and then we've got a 500
watt power supply here from Thermaltake
not I mean it's decent it's not the best
in the world but it's definitely a far
from the worst as well so that'll do no
really sort of easy to run budget build
so this is the next one at Lenovo PC
we've pulled this apart and we've got
some ddr2 immediately they're 2 gigabyte
sticks which is pretty solid we've got a
500 gigabyte hard drive out of this too
so the rest of it yeah the rest of its
so one more thing you can do before you
completely chuck out these builds Ashley
salvaged these little screws here it's
something I always do in that way you've
got screws for days so here's the next
piece either we pulled apart and it's
got a pentium ii 5800 again same deal
LGA 775 but we did get a 250 gig hard
drive out of it and also two two
gigabyte sticks of ddr3 so there's
another one of those ddr3 LGA 775 mobos
so next up here we've pulled out at 1155
motherboard and it had an i5 2400
installed so they're always a solid
choice had a little quad row as well
great if you need a test gravis card
since they don't need any PCIe
connectors and the jackpot one terabyte
hard drive which is always good and also
eight gigabytes of ddr3 now HP
motherboards you guys know they're a
pain in the ass to work with proprietary
practically everything and sometimes if
you're lucky you can get a gtx 1050 or a
750ti to work but a lot of the times
they don't even work on HP so we're just
gonna go with a bin job on this as well
and there's a window ooh what's this
jackpot
so now that we have literally gutted all
those pcs we now have of course one big
mess on our hands so what we're gonna do
now is essentially just repurpose these
shelves here and just get organized at
least with the shelf that has untested
parts and then hopefully we can get
actually organized around here so the
content can flow even faster
so now we're just past midnight and I've
cleaned this whole place up from tip to
toe we have finally organized I've got
shelf space again and we've got room to
breathe in here like it is just such a
night and day difference
what a bit of cleaning can do so I'm all
organized with cables got new products
there up on the top shelf we've got use
motherboards that haven't been tested
yet these are the ones I've got to go
through in the next can yes fix it
episode as well as some parts that have
been sent in from you guys I do keep
track of that I just want to get
organized so I can get back on track and
then we've got motherboards here that
are tests that I do know they work and
over here we've got some builds that
will be coming up this will be a full
use price performance build some of you
guys on Twitter have been messaging me
about this it's coming don't worry it's
gonna be hot price performance for y'all
and then we've got some potato cases
here in case we want to put together
some potatoes always need those on hand
and then we've got the 760 T right here
I've been speaking with Ethan from tag
mods we have drawn up a preliminary
design for Darth Jar Jar it is looking
so good it's I was gonna go with this
Linley case but then Ethan showed me
what he had in mind and man it looks so
good da-da-dah first hardlines water
tube built on the channel it's gonna be
something special
sr2 you guys are gonna love this I
really can't wait to do this
of course Ethan has a busy schedule as
do i and so i've got to fly down to
Wollongong to go meet up with him when
this bill gets done so we've got a
budget time for that expect that to come
in maybe early mid-september that is on
the works don't worry but of course
today during all this cleaning I had to
quickly go out and get this this is a
silverstone raven so i had to go out and
hustle this quickly go for sixty
australian dollars never seen this case
before I guess I've just been oblivious
to some of these cases but it looks
really cool it comes included with two
180 millimeter fans so gonna piece
together a building that and then we've
got the cool master tough build here
which will be hitting channel very soon
see
the tough stuff it looks so that golden
black theme and then we got down here
snap master flex I have pieced out all
the pieces for this hustle deals this is
going to be just one amazing 4k video
editing machine and it's going to be
possibly I believe this will be under a
thousand Australian dollars with 64
gigabytes of RAM with an 8 core 16
threaded Xeon and a sabertooth x79 gtx
980 3 terabyte hard drive 500 gigabyte
SSD thousand watt gold power supply
water cooler and a corset air 540 just
the way I like it and then we've got the
rest of the studio here that was that
build we put together today it was that
build we used for the 18 core actually
had two unfortunate return that to Intel
and then on to the last of the studio
it's looking pretty good i vacuumed all
this it's pretty clean anyway except the
benchmark rig could use a little bit of
a touch-up but we've got to test more
stuff on there anyway the Nook is in
pieces but it still turns on in that
state it's because I had to rip out the
two terabyte Samsung hard drive because
I used it for Computex and I use it for
a build and then I had to do the review
on it so lots of testing and let's take
a seat so here we are guys I do need to
shave I do need a haircut but what we
got here is now a clean studio it's
ready for the whole workflow and the
process to begin again and the reason
this time around it got so dirty was
just because we've just had so many
donations come into the channel in the
last month it's been absolutely crazy
but also the deal hunting as well I've
been going berserk I don't even know why
I've just I just addicted to this stuff
and so what we've had is just this sort
of build up and I'm just like not we're
gonna go crazy and that's exactly what
we did here today but also we've been
going crazy with the builds as well I
hope you guys have been enjoying the
content that's been coming out and if
you did then be sure to hit that like
button and let me know in the comment
section below what you want to see out
first in the queue here I'm pretty sure
snap master flex is getting up the queue
but also that budget build as well GTX
780 rig stay tuned for that got some
special stuff coming for you guys hope
you enjoyed it and I'll catch you in the
next one peace out for now
if you think them donations are gonna
bog down the yes man you gotta think
again I'm an all-nighter baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
