come and they go they usually don't
really impress me that much there was
one case that vastly became my favorite
case over time and that was the air 540
and in fact you can see him in the
background there he's just sitting down
watching me do this review he's actually
my best friend Haley little air 540 but
what we have right here is the crystal
680 X I'm told by Corsair this is the
true successor to the air 540 which was
released nearly six years ago back in
2013 and the reason this case became my
favorite case was because it had that
high airflow it had that aesthetics it
had that subtle LEDs with the front on
the white version at least with those
front two 140 mm fans and their LED
lighting and then on the rear you had
that 140 mil fan that kept things
relatively quiet it was such good
airflow to the point where your
temperatures of your components inside
your case were better than they were if
the side panel was off and that's
usually an indication of a well-made
case not only that had that back
component which is amplitudes room for
cable management if you would just need
a PC building you could go hand with the
jungle sandwich and still have a build
that looked phenomenal and ladies and
gentlemen I am glad to say that the s6
ATX does carry over a lot of the
attributes of the air 540 however there
are some subtle differences and some big
differences so let's go over all of them
in today's review
welcome back to check es sitting right
here the crystal 680 X this is the RGB
version it comes with three ll fans 120
mil at the front you've also got an
additional fan at the back so you've got
four fans in total that come with the
quiet mode operation from default now
this mode will make your temperatures a
little bit worse than the air 540 and in
fact when I tested them with NRT X 2080
in both cases with max overclocks we got
here the results of 58 degrees versus 56
degrees with the side panel on on the
air 540 vs. 62 versus 62 with a side
panel on and off with the crystal 680 X
so this means it's doing a good job of
cooling but it just means that the air
540 simpler design and mesh fronts
without any obtrusive
meant that it was getting better cooling
performance with the side panel on so
although a lot of factors considered the
noise was considerably lower on the 680
X Judah with lower CFM yet lower rpm
fans installed from the get-go we had 45
decibels verses 33 decibels so this
thing as you can see I am doing a review
right beside it and it's just whisper
quiet keep in mind am also using the H
115 i RGB platinum the other specs in
this build I'm using a 79 80 XC as well
as the Dominator memory and the azuz x2
9 9 deluxe 2 motherboard so this thing's
pretty much decked out with the latest
and greatest bling in 2019 except for
the CPU until lost for the 99 ATX II
back and let me keep the 79 80 XC so
that was a that was a it was an absolute
win but temperatures aside the
aesthetics now get tempered glass on the
front top and sides this door here has
very strong magnets to the point of our
field are a lot stronger than the
obsidian and so with that when you're
walking it won't unnecessarily open or
close by accident the top can be taken
off and the dust filter for how to
critique one thing it was a little bit
difficult to get out if you want to take
this off and clean it then you'll have
to remove your top radiator or whatever
you've got at the top with the top plate
and then take the dust filter out you
can also keep the tempered glass off if
you wish to but there are the
moments that prevent it from being
converted I guess into an air 5:40 with
no tempered glass on the top and the
front the Front's and bottoms also
featured dust filters and in the case of
the front just like the top you will
have to remove a plate in order to get
the dust filter out but with that you
can then install your fans and also your
radiator easily so I guess it is a
double-edged sword one in favor of
convenience yet at the same time one
also in detriment of convenience now
looking through the mounting slots all
throughout this case you can mount three
140mm fans at the front or three 120 s
or a 360 ml rat if you wish to going
down the bottom they've removed the two
hard drive cages
there were slot ends in the air 540 and
they were replaced it with the ability
to mount either a 240 or to 80 ml
radiator or fans if you wish to going up
above that you've got at the back the
ability to mount one 120 or one 140 ml
fan and then going up the top you've got
the option to mount a 280 or again a 240
ml radiator and in this case I chose to
mount the h1 59 Platinum which went in
smoothly and no problems whatsoever
now another difference in 2019 at the
front is the ability to vertically mount
a GPU however you will need a separate
kit in order to do that and if you want
to do that make sure you get a kit with
a proper riser cable in the past I've
tried those cheaper kits and they've
given me nothing but headaches where the
riser cable doesn't work properly anyway
moving over to the back of the case here
is where you'll be greeted with the
crystal 680 X's in my opinion benefits
and this is because it does have that
bigger cube shape just like the f5 44
the drive bays you've got a modular
system where you can take the whole cage
out like I've done here since I am using
an ass and an nvme drive or of course
you can mount four SSDs and three 3.5
inch mechanical drives the SSD cages can
detach from one to four meaning you can
take off the cages that you don't need
moving through the cable management
options here you can just do so much or
so little if you wish to if you just
wish to chuck a jungle sandwich in there
and still have a pretty look on the
front or if you wish to cable manage
things properly then you can also do
that at the rear here's all you'll find
the mount for your power supply in
abling you to mount even the biggest
power supplies in the game if you take
off the little bracket at the bottom I
chose to mount an RMI one foul
an X power supply completely overdone
for this build but I picked it up on a
hustle deal for a hundred Ozzie dollars
anyway the back side panel carries a
magnetic dust filter which spends the
whole way across the back panel itself
and there's some mesh for your drive
base so they can breathe easily included
with this is the RGB node command and
hub so you can install all your RGB
bling with no problem so you will be
locked into the Corsair ecosystem if you
choose to get the 680 X and now the last
section of the 680 X is where the power
button reset button and also USB ports
are located and they've changed it from
the front of the case to the top of the
case and I must say here that I do
prefer personally these buttons and
input outputs to be at the front like
they were on the air 540 this is because
I mount my PC on top of my desk though
I'm guessing Corsair figured most people
will be mounting these under their desk
and hence the change though I do like
the fact that they've also put a type C
on the front USB 3 and they've got the
mic in and audio out port now connected
to a hybrid 4 pin and here we are now at
crunch time with the air 6 ATX vs. the
air 540 and isn't that true successor
that you've been waiting for six years
in the making and that depends on
whether you like RGB and tempered glass
I think for the performance of this case
we'll get that out of the way with first
they've traded that high airflow for the
noise and they've really made a good job
of making this thing whisper quiet but
still performing well in terms of
airflow however if you are an airflow
maniac and you don't want to change fan
speeds or anything like that then the F
540 is still an excellent choice even in
2019
now for that look of RGB it's personally
growing on me a lot I actually love
Corsairs dominate a memory that h 115 i
RGB platinum their light loop fans they
look absolutely gorgeous of course you
can change the colors around you don't
have to have all the rainbow going
through you can change everything just
to one color and then the next week you
can change it to another color or you
can just change it to your temperatures
which is a very handy function the air
540 didn't have that function but of
course it didn't have tempered glass
either for me personally I'm not a big
fan of tempered glass I think it
adds to the weight of the build this
thing is pretty heavy it's noticeably
heavier than the air 540 despite it only
being about 50 mils taller with all the
other dimensions roughly the same the
temper glass at night although when
there's no light shining off it looks
gorgeous most the time when there's
light shining in you'll get reflections
it does fingerprint easy however I
really do like what they've done with
this door here it does have strong
magnets and it does give that premium
feel instead of the air 740 which when
you open the door it did feel a bit
tacky this just feels premium all the
way around and just like the f5 40 this
thing is an absolute breeze to build in
so basically if you like lighting you
like glass and you like low noise then
this is definitely gonna be the case for
you but lastly there's the big elephant
in the room to talk about and that is
the price this case is going to come in
at two hundred and forty nine ninety
nine USD so it is significantly more
expensive than the f5 forty which is
currently for sale from one hundred and
seventeen USD to a hundred and fifty and
that's the steel silver grey version I
never even knew that existed I thought
it only came in white and black if
you're in Australia currently comes in
at 170 Aussie dollars and I do believe
the F 540 is still going to be for sale
since it is such a good case even in
2019 though as for the Aussie pricing I
haven't been told officially what it is
yet I will hazard a guess and say it's
gonna come around 350 Aussie dollars and
you do get the for fans and the lighting
control included and you do pay that
premium over-the-air 540 as we said
before for the glass the better low
noise fans and also the controllers so I
guess in many ways the crystal 680 X is
a successor to the F 540 but in some
ways it's not and it does come at a
premium and I guess that's why Corsair
still have the air 540 for sale and with
that said I hope you guys enjoyed this
review if you did then be sure to hit
that like button and let us know in the
comments section below what you think of
the 680 x love reading your thoughts and
opinions as always as for me personally
I mean that air 540 in the back it's
it's like it's not the fact that it's
any air 540 that that one sitting on the
chair is my air 540 we have an
attachment it's
it's hard to explain anyway I'll catch
you guys in the next one if you enjoy
