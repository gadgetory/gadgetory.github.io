gt70 3 VR laptop that features two gtx
1070 cards in sli and costs a lot of
money 3400 USD or around 5300 Australian
dollars and at that price you're
probably wondering what can this thing
do well let's take a look
welcome back to tech es city this is
brian coming to you guys today with the
biggest laptop I have seen yet it is so
huge in fact that it needs to power
bricks which are rated at 330 watts
apiece and connect via their own sli
magic to power this thing alone then on
top of that it weighs in at a solid 5
kilograms for the laptop by itself and
it also features a 17.3 inch IPS display
that runs at 120 Hertz at 1080p
I found this monitor to be quite good in
gaming and also didn't have any
noticeable ghosting and it also had a
very impressive levels of input lag
beating out my a Tron vision 1440p
Korean panel which is mediocre but still
it is good to see a laptop beating this
monitor in both input lag and response
times it also features an Intel i7 7820
HK mobile processor which has a stock
frequency of 2.9 gigahertz and features
Intel's latest cabbie like a PC and
comes with Windows 10 64 bit Home
Edition though how did it perform in the
real world well it scored 858 Center
benches in Cinebench r15 and allow the
CPU to boost all the way up to 4
gigahertz on all cores and hit around 91
degrees max at 25 degrees ambience which
was very impressive for a laptop though
the noise did get very loud near
jet-like asker levels and after running
out of 64 for a good 20 minutes the CPU
did hover between 3.6 to 4 gigahertz
meaning it was slightly throttling
itself during this benchmark and will
perform like this in programs like Adobe
Premiere Pro final renders for memory
there are two sticks of 16 gigabytes of
ddr4 2400 memory and dual channel
configuration for a total of 32
gigabytes this will allow you to do
things like mobile video editing quite
well even in 4k with the included
scissor switch keyboard designed by
SteelSeries it includes RGB LED
backlighting that can be configured in
different modes this also extends to the
touchpad itself and typing on this thing
was not only a breeze but there was also
a numpad there which I'm personally a
big fan of and it was quite responsive
though how well could I type on this
keyboard well let's take a look and a
listen
there's also quite a large touchpad
which was very solid and the clicks on
the button felt very firm and had good
feedback though I seriously would
recommend getting a mouth as I
personally can't do hardly anything on
touchpad with the limitations being as
far as opening a movie to sending an
email which if you are like me and that
is all you need to do when traveling
then the touchpad will work quite well
also above the Escape key you have
dinner audio speakers which is powered
by the realtek ALC $8.99 codec which has
support for up to 24 bit 192 kilohertz
stereo output and features decent sound
with 3 watt speakers and is quite loud
and clear for a laptop though of course
lacking any warmth or bass is to be
expected since it doesn't have anything
near the likes of a decent subwoofer
though what about the audio crosstalk
levels
well while playing some left and right
speaker test the levels showed cross
talks of almost even levels meaning this
was some of the worst audio I've seen on
a device sighs spa audio was leaking
from left to right channels and
vice-versa to the other channels even
when I completely muted the device I
will let you guys take a listen left
channel laughs channel laughs channel
into the laptop and also what looks like
a slot for a webcam that sits just above
the screen though I couldn't get this to
work indicating that there might not
even be a webcam present though the mic
import was quite good and clear and had
a good signal with almost no noise now
again I'll let you guys have a quick
listen here's what the GT 73 VR laptop
will sound like the mic input with AV
mode of boom probe plug directly into
that mic in port with a plus 20 DB gain
with a volume level of 55 the laptop
also includes one terabyte of backup
storage on a 7200 rpm HGST Drive and
four main storage you get what looks
like two Intel 600 P nvme PCIe 240 GB
SSDs in raid 0 and our configuration
though it makes boot time soft measuring
in a roughly 13 seconds from a cold boot
to Windows and also general usage was
super snappy as well though first lists
are things like video editing and large
file transfers I am NOT a fan of these
drives at all as they have quite
or performance in terms of consistency
you can check out a review of these up
here though moving on into the crux of
this review the dual GTX 1070 that are
in SLI this is a huge amount of CUDA
cores for a laptop 4,096 to be exact
placing it above even that of the latest
time XP that was recently released
there's also a total of 16 gigabytes of
gddr5 vram clocked at 8000 megahertz
effective though in most titles you'll
only have a max of 8 gigabytes available
and of course since it is in sli it
won't scale perfectly unless the game
calls for it which as we know is always
hit and miss they're looking at a 3d
mark 5 strike score it managed to get
31,000 122 GPU and 12,000 477 CPU for a
combined score of 7500 58 coming in a
comparable level to that of my main
desktop gaming PC and of course playing
games with the frame rates there was
through the roof at 1080p this
configuration would be suited for 1440p
ultra white or even 4k high settings in
gaming though in games itself the noise
of the laptop did reach level similar to
the CPU test and the GPUs did hover
around 80 degrees and also stated those
levels whilst gaming in for honor for
quite some time so I'll let you guys
have a quick listen to how loud this
laptop can actually get walls gaming
the base of this laptop also features
three USB 3 ports on the left-hand side
a headphone out line in and out and also
mic imports there's also events on all
sides of the laptop allowing for
efficient heat dissipation and air flow
on the right hand side there is a
further 2 USB 3 ports and a memory card
SD reader and on the rear there's a
proprietary power in a thunderbolt port
an rj45 jack powered by the killer a
2500 neck HDMI 2.0 and mini display 1.4
outs for wireless there is the killer
end / a / AC 1535 and you also get
qualcomm atheros 4.1 bluetooth support
the killer software included also means
that if you're on a congested network
then it can prioritize packets and help
with gaming which I have tested in the
past and can make a difference on poor
quality connections not that I recommend
gaming on a congested network to begin
with battery life is also a funny thing
if you unplug the power brick then games
will run incredibly slow and you will
still then only get about one hour off
the battery itself now that you want to
gain like this at all though there is a
feature to switch off the GPUs via a
button on the right hand side and after
you've restarted the computer you can
get quite a good run if you do this and
if you need this laptop for doing work
while you're on a business trip for
example then you can expect quite decent
battery up life where in this mode there
was just a little bit under 4 hours
battery life when I was watching youtube
videos so now we're finally at
conclusion time and honestly a laptop
like this is geared towards people who
need some level of portability more than
a desktop but need ridiculous amounts of
power and keep in mind that you will be
paying for it but the model here coming
in at roughly 3400 USD or 5300 Ivy I
honestly couldn't see myself personally
purchasing one of these as they are much
heavier and less portable than a smaller
lighter sized laptop and still although
very close not as powerful as a
dedicated desktop PC and you are still
susceptible to SLI problems versus a
single 1080 TI for example the fans will
also get quite noisy when performing any
tasks that I would otherwise perform on
my desktop on extreme load and also the
crosstalk levels on audio was so bad to
the point where I'd recommend getting a
dedicated
and solution though with that said it is
an extremely nice laptop in the 120
Hertz 1080p IPS display is gorgeous and
great to game on and this is a laptop
that features everything that I could
think of jewel 10 7 is a fast 4 core a
threaded i7 a solid keyboard with RGB
backlighting great utility and
connectivity and also has cool apps like
msas true color srgb which gives you a
claimed 100% srgb accuracy with the fans
and the temps as loud as they are though
I would not recommend overclocking on
this model and didn't dare delve into
the depths of overclocking on this as
much as I would have loved to since it
was a lone sample and the temperatures
are already quite high to begin with
while gaming though the build quality is
nice and if you are into needing a
desktop replacement computer you can
take the land event or your friend's
house and then when you come home want
to plug into a larger higher res monitor
then you can do that of course with the
GT 73 VR and that VR label is of course
stating that it has the power to play
anything that a VR headset would demand
though just remember that it will cost
you monetarily also the model I have
here was a little bit of a mystery since
they couldn't find an exact model with
the i7 7820 HK and 120 Hertz display and
jeweled GTX 10 70s and there are a lot
of different models out there so it
ultimately prefer one with a 120 Hertz
1080p screen and a single GPU and power
brick I think that would be the way to
ultimately go if you wanted to purchase
one of these laptops anyway guys I hope
you enjoyed today's review of MSI gt70 3
VR tightened SLI gaming laptop and let
me know you think of it in the comment
section below
would love to hear your thoughts and
opinions as always and I'll catch you in
another tag video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
