released and everyone wants to know is
it one big massive fail let's find out
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
tech yes city this is brian coming back
to you guys today with a review of black
ops 3 multiplayer now this has been a
highly anticipated release on the cod
series especially since track did an
amazing job with black ops 2 in that it
was so smooth not only for the PC but
also for the ps3 and the Xbox 360 so
today I'm gonna be taking a look at the
multiplayer because I'm sure a lot of
people want to purchase this game based
on how good the multiplayer is and
especially since Kol that Judi ghost was
just one big epic fail and that it
started all the time and they never
fixed it and then Call of Duty advanced
warfare was just mediocre at best so now
I've played this for over 10 hours and
I'll put the specs of my rig in the
description below but for what it's
worth it's running really smooth on my
PC I'm surprised and how smooth it is
though there is a caveat to that and
that is that I have to turn my settings
down to medium for some reason this is a
4k though when I tested this at 1440p
and 1080p at Ultra it was as smooth as
butter so you guys on gtx 970 or r9 380
graphics cards i'm not gonna have to
worry too much about running this game
at those resolutions it's just at 4k
this thing really starts to eat up the
video memory on your graphics card and
that's a problem I was having with this
game so I've turned it down to medium
and it still looks really good at 4k so
I think any game looks good at 4k when
you when you have all those pixels to
push out but anyway those people who are
like does it stutter
the answer is no it's not a Call of Duty
ghosts pile of crap or it's not advanced
warfare where you've got some occasional
stutter so this game is as smooth as
butter it's running really nice and I
can highly recommend it in that regard
though what I want to talk about is how
much does it differ from black ops 2
multiplayer and now really there's a
same feel to the game you've got the
score streaks in there
you've also got your customizations of
the guns and the kind of the gun classes
and the guns kind of feel the same for
what it's worth I mean you've for
instance I'm using the VMP but that
feels a lot like the mp4 off my memory I
swear this gun is like a replica and
then a lot of the scorestreaks are still
there you know you've got the Hellfire
missiles got the care package you got
the UAV and then you've got first 275 so
those of you who have played black ops 2
will just fit really quickly into this
game and then you've got that walking on
walls and double jump which doesn't
really change the game up a lot but one
thing I do want to talk about is the new
classes as you can see here I am playing
a battery with the war machine perk now
every class will get this and it's kind
of like a bonus that adds up after you
kill people or you run around or whatnot
and now I've got the war machine perk
which will just centrally fire off a
trock 'its
and it's very strong in my opinion
there's also a lot of different ones you
can see here someone's actually using
the teleport perk so there's different
things like that and they are enjoyable
even though they aren't really that
powerful
so whatever class you pick don't spend
too long thinking about what's the best
class cuz I'd probably recommend the
battery at the moment I think the
battery is really good in these small
cluster maps now a lot of people I'm
sure wondering on the PC is black ops 3
a team deathmatch fest and the answer so
far is unfortunately yes I mean I've
jumped into this game and all people
seem to be playing thus far is either
team deathmatch or the bonus new town
map so I'd love to see more people
playing different options however that's
how it's been since Call of Duty ghosts
when that was released though ps4 users
and Xbox one users you guys don't have
to worry there's just gonna be a huge
player base pretty much playing
everything but what about the graphics
now at 4k this game does look really
good I'm impressed with the graphics
especially for a cod game I think
they're decent at the same time they're
not anything like Crysis 3 for example
so don't buy this game thinking it's
gonna be a graphical breakthrough the
one thing I will say is that the
lighting does look a lot better than
some of the previous Cod's
they have added some great features
there the ambient occlusion looks really
good as well and another thing I wanted
to touch base on with the PC version is
now we have the limiter there for 240
FPS and also the field of view slider
going all the way from 65 to 120 so
people who are coming onto PC to play
this competitively are going to be very
happy now another thing I wanted to
touch on was spawn points and maps so
the spawn points I'm glad to say seem to
be okay I wasn't annoyed or anyone
wasn't getting pissed off with the spawn
points thus far so they seem to have got
that right from the get-go
though I want to complain a little bit
about the maps for some reason I just
enjoyed the black ops 2 maps a little
bit more I mean I thought they were just
perfect for the player base and the
player size especially in team
deathmatch I kind of feel in these maps
but especially for team deathmatch which
is a lot of what a lot of people gonna
play it's just it's a little bit too big
sometimes and then some of the maps you
feel like you're just fighting over one
area of the map all the time rather as
opposed to black ops 3 it kind of felt
like you were fighting at least over 2
different points on the map at any given
time so I kind of enjoyed the black ops
2 maps a little bit more though keep in
mind I still have to adjust to these
maps and I'm sure a lot of people are
gonna come into this game sort of being
confused about the maps as I was though
I'm starting to get the hang of it and
it is decent though I just wanted to
point out that I kind of do enjoy those
black ops 2 maps a little bit more thus
far so a good point about that though is
that they actually have the characters
which you can change the camouflages or
the costumes before the map begins and
now this is pretty important because if
you're on an ice map for example you'd
kind of want to put on your arctic gill
so I do like the maps in that regard and
that they now you can change the style
and the look of your character to
actually try and blend in on a different
map so that's something cool about black
ops 3 that kind of wasn't really there
in black ops 2 now lastly let's talk
about perks which is a big part of any
black ops 2 game now this time people
would be sad to know that they've taken
away toughness I couldn't find it
anywhere and I was
kind of a bit annoyed because I do
always roll toughness in black ops 2
they're having it not there seems to
change the game a little bit I mean you
don't flinch as much as you do in black
ops 2 if you don't have toughness so I
guess that's a good thing it's kind of
like that balanced it in-between though
the other perks are pretty much all the
same for what it's worth a lot of those
black ops 2 perks that you used too will
be in black ops 3 though one thing I
will complain about since I do play on
the Asian servers and everyone literally
sound whores here is that I wish they
had dead silence a lot earlier in the
leveling up tree as it's one talent that
I pretty much always take as I love it
you know people can't sound whore then
you can actually have decent run-and-gun
classes because I find a lot of people
are just camping based on sound whoring
at the moment and it is a is a really
annoying when you get a group of people
who are sound whoring so that about
wraps it up guys ultimately I'm going to
be recommending this game as it's a lot
better than the previous two Cod's in my
opinion especially on the PC though
black ops 2 still has a place in my
heart and I kind of still had a lot more
fun on black ops 2 when that was first
released as opposed to black ops 3
though black ops 3 is still a great game
and I'm sure a lot of people are gonna
enjoy it especially if you got
disappointed with ghosts and advanced
warfare so whatever guys I'll put my
