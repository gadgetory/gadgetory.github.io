80 X Z CPU from Intel this is 18 cause
36 threads there's so many cause and
threads on this thing in fact that
afterburner a software for monitoring
your CPU utilization and GP utilization
in games can't even stretch out that
many threads it can only recognize up to
32 threads so when it came to monitoring
games and doing literally so many things
at once this CPU was too much for even
the software to handle but in today's
video we're gonna take a look at why
someone would even want to buy something
like the I 9 79 80 XC and comparing it a
little bit against the i7 8700 K for
example which does have less cause less
threads and does have higher clock
speeds and cost considerably less I mean
this thing comes in at around 2000 US
dollars or if you're in Australia 2,700
AUD and see just how much it takes to
stress this CPU out but before we get
onto the making of this gorgeous build
I'd like to give a big thanks to Intel
for sponsoring out today's video
welcome back to tech yesterday and here
we have the 18 core installed on an X
299 Tai Chi motherboard from asrock now
straight away with something like this
you'll have to get a good motherboard
something like the Tai Chi will cost
around 290 dollars you're also going to
use a lot of memory especially if you're
video editing today we're using 32
gigabytes of HyperX predator memory this
stuff has tight timings at CL 15 and XMP
profiles at 2 9 33 megahertz which is so
easy in the bass to lock in now another
thing you can do with this CPU is
overclocked it so out of the box
it'll clock to 3.4 gigahertz
automatically on all cores
whilst you're doing a Cinebench run for
example or if you're doing video editing
it's marked at 2.6 gigahertz but that's
because it carries the AVX instructions
which does turn out a lot of heat
compared to traditional work where you
don't use those AVX instructions for
instance in video editing in Adobe
Premiere Pro you aren't using those
instructions and it will juice about 400
watts from the wall both in stress
testing and when you're utilizing all
those cores at 4 gigahertz and I say 4
Giga it's because that's the balance
that I got here today I managed to
overclock the CPU with ease and we're
using a 280 millimeter cooler master
water cooler as well and this keep the
temperatures under control we're only
getting a maximum of 80 degrees so it
was handling everything absolutely fine
however when it comes to games it will
fall slightly behind the 8700 K when it
comes to just gaming for instance csgo
the frame rates were just a little bit
behind they're still very impressive on
the 79 80 XC i moving over to pub G and
Final Fantasy 15 saw no difference
since these games are frame capped when
it comes to streaming from the CPU
however in x264 which a lot of people
still love to do because apparently you
get better image quality especially when
you lower the settings to either slow
medium or fast you did pull ahead with
the 79 80 XE it just had so much more
room to work with of course it's got
quad channel memory if you want to
utilize that too if you've got other
applications open at the same time for
example but this is where the difference
was made you're getting really good
image quality very smooth gameplay the
0.1 and 1% lows especially on the medium
and slow settings are still quite low
but these are very taxing settings
when it came to the fast-setting it did
pull ahead of the 8700 k especially in
csgo move over to pub G and Final
Fantasy 15 didn't show a huge difference
but it does show the maximum potential
of the cpu now to make things even more
ridiculous I decided to really stress
this cpu I put in Adobe Premiere Pro
decided to mix some music have a browser
open stream and play a video game all at
the same time and everything was still
holding up so this thing if you want to
multitask like an absolute boss then
that's where the CPU will really excel
now another thing recently which is very
weird because I use Adobe Premiere Pro
for editing videos is it just got an
update where it can now utilize all
caused and all threads so even up to an
18 core 36 threaded beast like this the
render times were absolutely insane I
can't stress how surprised I was we're
talking around 7 minutes and 34 seconds
vs. 16 minutes and 59 seconds on the
8,700 case so there's a massive
difference this is on a review that I
would push out on the channel which has
a lot of transitions a lot of After
Effects and also a lot of text scrolling
moving presets and even color correction
too so it's a very heavy workload and
even of course the 1080 Ti is helping
with that with cooter acceleration but
it goes to show that Premiere Pro is
still very CPU dependent especially when
it comes to the actual live work time
which will utilize all those calls and
threads now with the latest update and
in a nutshell that's pretty much the
core I 9 extreme if you need something
that can do everything and you can
utilize 18 cores and 36 threads
especially in the professional work
space with even some of the updates
coming from Adobe themselves finally
then this thing will deliver of course
if you're going to spend a lot of money
on CPU like this then I do highly
recommend getting good gear to match get
a nice case we're using the H 500 P here
and when I did some temperature tests
with the thermal-imaging camera this
case was absolutely fine also the noise
was really quiet
we've got good memory we've got a very
good motherboard with the X to 990 Qi
and also an EVGA 10
ETI to boot for the power supply we're
using an 850 white gold Raider pounce
play and that handled this build
absolutely fine so again the CPU itself
juicing around 400 watts from the wall
when you're in games it'll actually
juice even less because those cores are
now not getting loaded as much and even
the 1080 TR power consumption really
won't match it actually balances out
just a little over 400 watts in games
soo so very potent very huge and again a
big thanks for Intel for sponsoring out
this video although I don't get to keep
this CPU which I'm devastated about I'd
love to put this thing in my new rig
especially with that new update that
changes pretty much the whole game when
it comes to my workflow and I do spend a
lot of time in Adobe Premiere and Adobe
Creative Cloud for example so hope you
guys enjoyed today's video if you did
then be sure to hit that like button let
me know in the comments section below
what you think of the 79 80 X e and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
