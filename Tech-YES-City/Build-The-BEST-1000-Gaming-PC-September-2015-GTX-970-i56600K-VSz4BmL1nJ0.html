build for September 2015 and this is
going to be a skylight build
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
tech yes City this is brian coming back
to you guys today with an interesting pc
build this month I've been getting a lot
of requests for skylake builds so I'm
gonna be doing just that today however
that being said I'm going to be putting
a link in the description below for the
Xeon Haswell build as well which
honestly is better value for money in my
opinion so I'll be putting the links for
both these pcs in the description below
though for what it's worth we'll be
focusing on the skylight build today so
let's get on with it so for the cpu
we're going with the Intel i5 6600 K now
this is a four core four threaded beast
of a CPU it's also the latest and
greatest out from Intel at the moment so
not only that you'll be able to
overclock this thing and you'll have the
best IPC out there so this thing will
give you a snappy desktop experience as
well as play all those latest games that
you need it to play and with dx12 around
the corner as well the four core four
thread debate isn't much to worry about
now when overclockable sleeping you
wouldn't be complete with a CPU cooler
so for that we're going with a cooler
master 212 Evo this thing is going to be
able to keep this CPU under control it's
going to be able to tame this hot beast
and it's gonna be able to do a good job
of that for $25 now for the motherboard
we're going with the z170 from MSI this
is the m3 now this thing comes loaded
with everything that I would want from a
motherboard on a z170 solution we've got
good onboard audio we've also got a good
anti C and a very solid v RM and the vrm
has some solid heat sinks covering that
so you'll be able to game 24/7 even
overclocked knowing that nothing is
going to go wrong now next up for the
memory we've got 2 8 gigabyte sticks of
ddr4 memory from g.skill this is the
Ripjaws series now this comes a little
bit over $100 though with a mail-in
rebate or a promo code I think it is you
can get it under $100 now it does
command a premium over ddr3 though one
good benefit about ddr4 is if you buy
this memory today you'll be able to use
it as a future-proof sort of memory for
years to come so you'll be able to use
it in your next build even though it's
more expensive today now for disk drives
we're going with two solutions today the
first being a SSD from P&amp;amp;Y this is 240
gigabytes and it comes in at $70
that's right $70 for 240 units of SSD
really good value for money and P&amp;amp;Y have
a decent reputation in the hardware
market so that's a good thing too now
for the backup drive we're going with a
Hitachi Deathstar and this thing
honestly has been gaining reputation in
the tech world for being one of the best
hard drives in terms of value for money
so good work from Hitachi
now for the gravis card the most
important part of the PC build and we're
going with the GTX 970 from ZOTAC this
thing comes in just a little bit over
$300 and at this price range it is
really good value for money you're gonna
be playing any game at 1080p perfectly
fine you'll even be able to play most
titles at 60 FPS on 1440p so ZOTAC have
you covered with a really good graphics
card with the GTX 970
now for the case we're done with an
interesting solution this is the
animatics thorax now I've tried Animax
cases in the past and they are really
good they're lightweight so if you're
carting them around you're not gonna get
a hernia also you've got ample room
inside to install all your components
with these and you've got a lot of room
for cable management and all that it
just comes over $30.00 so it's really
good value for money now for the power
supply we're going with an EVGA 500 watt
bronze rated power supply this thing
comes in at $30 that's after a mail-in
rebate there were $30 it is exceptional
value for money you're getting a solid
power supply and 500 watts is going to
be ample fine for our build today so if
you did want to step it up on the power
supply which I'd always sort of
recommend then you can get like a
Coolermaster 650 watt gold raider power
supply for around about $70 so I'll put
the link in the description below for
that too if you want to step it up on
the power supply would you kind of give
you more options in the future so we'll
know this build comes in just a little
bit over $1000 so if you count in those
mail-in rebates and promo codes you can
get this thing for under $1000 now the
good thing about this
it will be a really solid gaming PC
though one thing I will stress is that
if you do want to save money and you
want to get the best value for money in
my opinion then I'd be going with the
house well 1231 v3 build now then you're
gonna be saving around one hundred and
twenty dollars you're also gonna happen
hyper-threaded CPU so yeah you guys can
do what you want but honestly if I was
building a new PC I probably be going
with the Haswell 1231 v3 build just
because it is really good value for
money so links in the description below

builds then drop a comment in the
