fam my homies my bees well they've been
asking me for a while now to make an
ultimate used parts buyer's guide and
today it finally cometh to he who
requested welcome back to tech yet city
this is brand commit to you guys today
with a video on used PC parts buying and
now this is not going to be a generic
how to simple tricks and what not this
is just going to be my main tips and
points for how I do things and I want to
share that with you guys so with that
being said let's get on with trick
number one broaden horizon this is the
first and probably the biggest point I
need to stress when you're looking for
those use deals when you're searching
for the use parts try to have a flexible
budget and say if you want to make a
1080p high settings rig then instead of
just going for a particular set of parts
say for instance a 2500 KZ 67 mobo and
7950 only and that's all you want
instead of just going for those parts
broaden the horizon go check out an i5
760 overclock it get a 79 70 instead or
gtx 680 check out some other gtx six
cards or even 7 series AMD cards and
look for bargains in a number of
categories to fit together a gaming pc
that will work if you are just looking
for one particular part then chances are
you going to be either looking for a
long time or you're just not going to
get a deal at all
point number two suss out the seller
this mainly applies for the internet and
buying deals online where you get the
items posted to you and you have to
essentially trust the seller an easy way
to get around this is to get real
pictures of the product and also get a
pic of the product confirm working if
possible one big telltale of a broken
part listed is working is confirmed
working when I last foot took the PC
apart or when I used it X months ago it
was confirmed working this is pretty
suspicious in my opinion if you've used
the PC a month ago or if it was working
then it works right you just say it
works because when you last used it it
worked and unless you know meteors
crashed in your house and burn the PC
part into smithereens PC parts quite
simply work or they don't work and look
for people with listing them as such
also another tip here is just check out
the sellers feedback look for any
glaring negatives that are left there
say for instance someone got a pot and
it just didn't work at all and then
check the listing and it was working
then you know that seller might be
flipping some dodgy stuff also on that
note if you're picking up stuff you know
from Craig's List or you're going to
pick up stuff off gum tree where you
actually can see it then that's a lot
safer you know people aren't generally
going to lie because you've got their
phone number and if they are scamming
you you can report them to the police
straight up so generally you're not
going to get scammed for you know IRL
deals as opposed to the Internet
point number three you're going to get
hosed when you're dealing with used
parts there is always going to be people
who are going to pull shady like
that one bad apple in the bunch
I've been hosed in the past before with
dead CPUs even the next 79 motherboard
that I paid around $80 for and it was
completely burnt like toast this thing
was useless and I didn't know until
after the auction but the seller was
using someone else's photos for that
motherboard that they just ripped off
Google and now putting it in place of
their own photos had I'd seen the real
photos man I would have stayed away from
this motherboard with a ten-foot pole
but that's the way with the use parts
market you're going to get some really
good deals from time to time but at the
same time you can expect to get hosed
sooner or later but pretty much the sum
that out belong you're dealing use parts
the more likely you are to get high
there's going to be sellers out there
who are just straight-up scamming or
there's people out there redrawing the
line for instance a PC that is working
with the hard disk drive that literally
is near death I mean I've seen it all
here folks but let's look at the last
point point number four keep on hustling
this is the most important part of
getting a deal you call a guy it's sold
move on if not see how he or she
responds and go from there
this is where experience will play a big
role in getting those deals especially
when it comes to bartering the right
price though also on this note if you
pick up parts you don't have to always
build a PC with them for instance I got
a next 79 gigabyte ud7 practically new
for around about 160 USD now this board
is selling on eBay for 450 USD with no
accessories so instead of putting this
in a build I'm just going to sell it
anyway guys I hope you enjoyed today's
guide I hope I brought a unique
perspective to PC parts honey and
remember anything's possible out there
so just get on those websites get on
those deals wherever you can get the
deals from keep on hustling and if you
like this video - be sure to hit that
like button it was also pretty funny in
the process of doing this video I found
- really damn hot deals I've already
picked them up they're going to be going
into a build coming soon to the channel
so I hope you enjoy this video and I'll
catch you in the next one very soon
peace out for now bye
so we just got the 7970 now it's pretty
clear what mike upgraded from here he's
got a GTX 1080 box so he's got his 1080
and he's just sold his 7970 for
literally nothing so picked this up for
90 AUD or 66 USD so yeah let's get back
and see if this how well this thing
works and what we can do with it
so you guys with your support I can now
afford a soft sir so if you jump on
patron you never know if you can support
a dollar a month I'll be able to upgrade
to a chok chok
