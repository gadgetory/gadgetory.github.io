that featured two beastly CPUs and I use
it as a workstation for quite some time
however when I had to move back to
Australia I found that the case and a
lot of the components had to be
dismantled and shipped back otherwise it
would just cost more and shipping them
the PC is actually worse but here we
have today with a new case or should I
say a new body for what is called junuh
cron a PC named after a character called
Unicron in 1986 Transformers the movie
film which is arguably one of the best
movies of all time
and welcome back to tech city this is
brian coming to you guys today with part
one of the resurrection of june ekron
now in this first part we're going to be
doing the whole build and sort of giving
you a look at the basic build with all
the pretties on that part - I really
want to showcase it and so to get some
custom decals on there and really
showcase the character which is based on
in that Unicron
but anyway instead of going through the
parts list and just putting b-roll with
the prices I'm going to talk about what
makes this build so special on the first
part here is these CPUs these are the e
526 70s they are essentially an 8 core
16 threaded CPU now the best thing about
these is that they were going for around
65 USD and so you get two of these and
you put them on a motherboard that can
support two of these CPUs and you now
have 16 cause and 32 threads for like
140 bucks even though the motherboard
was about $300 so it was pretty
expensive but if you can get the
motherboard and the CPUs then you've
just got so much processing power that's
so cheap and then the second part that
makes this build so good is the hundred
twenty eight gigabytes of ddr3 memory we
pick this up for around about a hundred
and ten dollars so that's just an insane
amount of memory for the money then of
course we've got some other parts here
like an adduce sound card really good
value for money this is getting an
upgrade too for the GPU we were using a
GTX 970 before but now we're going to be
using a 980 TI who's got the Arctic
extreme cooler on it does a really
awesome job two cooler master 212
they're also spray-painted white bit of
a custom look there and a super flower
power supply one terabyte SSD from
Western Digital and a three terabyte
hard drive we've also got this sent out
from BitFenix this is the Shogun they
wanted me to take a look at this case
and when I saw that it supported the
extended ATX format I decided that
Unicron would be a perfect build to be
resurrected in this case here the Shogun
and they've also sent out some RGB LED
lights as well to put in there so Gina
chrome is going to be looking pretty
fancy anyway let's get started with this
build and we'll get to work
all mine when moving through the night
we just
you know
came within we justified outfit we got
it you wanna ride till we find answers
within location hold on we're gonna yeah
we
so there it is guys stage one of this
build is finished there's still some
more work to be done like adding some
custom decals and maybe some other
things that I'm yet to think of but the
build itself is complete and doing a
quick benchmark on gta5 shows this pcs
weakness and that is gaming when
comparing the overclocked to 980ti
with this combo compared to the 7700 K
for example it falls behind by quite a
bit
roughly 37% behind at the same setting
on the same benchmark so when it comes
to multi-threaded performance this thing
kicks some serious tail all across the
galaxy and for the money also since it
has 64 gigabytes of memory and so much
processing power that I can multitask
and do so many things at once without
having to worry about slowdown even
though the 7700 K does feel a bit more
snappier in the real world that there
will be many more benchmarks in the
final showcase of this build once they
complete it and also those eBay cables
were damn impressive
they even came included with moveable
cones and with the cheapest solution I
could find so all I can say to gamer
chief is well played so now I wanted to
talk about the BitFenix Shogun which was
sent out for a review and overall it is
a very nice case building and it was
however very time-consuming as I had to
insert an extended ATX panel and also
figure out how to make the motherboard
fit firmly without having any flex so in
the end I put two rubber pads on the top
and bottom right corners though the
cable management of the back was so easy
to work with
even with this extended ATX panel
installed and I had no problems running
cable extensions to the two CPU eight
pin headers and 24 pin ATX header and
with this case there was so much room
for Drive to for SSDs in total and six
3.5 inch SATA drives from the bays and
you can also remove those bays if you
wish so you will have to remove the top
two bays if you want to use extended ATX
at the front of the case you get your
SSD tray with RGB colors shining on it
which also acts as a hybrid shroud for
the power supply the 3.5 inch drives and
the ugly cables behind it there's also
an RGB controller included on the back
of the case which then gives you control
the front
panel for RGB lighting which on the top
besides that RGB button features 2 USB 3
and 2 USB 2 port as well as your
standard resetting power buttons and
audio in and out jacks both side panels
a tempered glass with the rear having an
extremely dark tint to it so dark that
even the RGB strip that I put in the
rear could not be seen from the outside
the front however was a completely
different story the RGB strips really
added to the look of this build and
there was so much room to work with in
the front of the case as well if you
wish you can have 360 mil radiators to
either the top and/or front of the case
and there's also one removable dust
filter at the bottom of the case however
on the top and sides of the case there
is only fixed steel mesh and at the
front of the case only the sides feature
air intake and the bottom front of the
case is completely naked with no dust
filters whatsoever there's a further
three GPU support arms included though I
found that this didn't work with my EE
ATX motherboard so now it's verdict time
I really liked the final look at this
case and also the build quality which is
damn good nothing felt flimsy at all in
the BitFenix Shogun and I had no
problems whatsoever when doing this
build though I will say it was the most
time-consuming case to work in and that
was of course partly due to the project
itself however I also found the included
fans were quite weak as well even at
full power I would have also liked to
have seen a third fan included at the
front of the case there overall a very
solid case that comes in at currently
143 USD on Amazon or roughly 234 AUD in
Australia and it goes if you enjoyed
this video to be sure to hit that like
button if you dislike I just slam that
dislike button and let me know in the
comment section below what do you think
of the BitFenix Shogun do you think it
was worthy of junik romped resurrection
absolutely personally love the look of
this case I really can't wait to
complete the build fully for you guys in
part 2 and with that said I'll catch you
guys in another tech video very soon
he's alpha now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
