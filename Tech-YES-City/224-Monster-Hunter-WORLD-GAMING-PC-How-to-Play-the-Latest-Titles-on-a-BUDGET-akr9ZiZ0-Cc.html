released on PC after being released on
console quite some time ago but right
here beside me is we've got all these
used PC parts that we've hustled and the
minimum requirements now on PC state
that you need an FX 6300 or an i5 4460
and a GTX 760 or r7 260x or greater so
today we've actually got an i7 860 which
isn't exactly the same specification as
an i5 4460 but of course we're gonna be
overclocking it and we've also got here
a GTX 780 so it's better than a 760 and
we're gonna see what FPS we can get but
of course what about the prices we've
picked up this whole PC here in a hustle
deal in Japan for around about fifty
five US dollars cost the 6000 yen and we
also got an SSD that we're gonna throw
in it to make things snappy I got this
on sale for xxx strain dolls it should
be like 22 US dollars and then the case
we actually discarded the case in Japan
because we had to travel and we got this
here for around about eight US dollars
this is kind of like a monster hunter
looking case so we thought we'd fit the
theme with something that looks a little
bit crazy and back to the gravis card
which is the final piece of the puzzle
we picked this up for around 100 US
dollars which is like ten thousand
eleven thousand Japanese yen so here's
the total cost of the build we are just
coming under 200 US dollars and the game
itself costs around sixty US dollars on
Steam but you can pick it up cheaper on
CD key sites that do wholesale the keys
which is exactly what we did with that
aside let's put this thing together
strap on in and have some fun
since we're dealing with used pots I
have to clean these down my method of
choice is usually a bit of brake cleaner
if it's really dirty the data vac and
also a bit of wd-40 for that new look
shine however although the motherboard
the CPU in the case of dirty this grab
is card here is actually very clean and
might even dare say that it's actually
new and hasn't been used before because
the fins on the blower here are in
immaculate condition usually only used
grabs guard the fans whether it be one
as small as this or the big fans on your
custom gravis cards will usually have
dust on them and traces of dust even if
they've been cleaned out so why the
someone has really clean this which
means we don't have to clean it or it's
brand new which I'm going with the
latter with that aside let's start
cleaning these parts down and put this
build together
so now we've just booted it up and
sometimes there are problems this time
around I think the motherboard is
problematic honestly I've never seen a
problem like this before
it'll boot up and it'll get into the
windows splash screen in order to boot
the computer but after that it'll arm
it'll just crash and so we've tried
different memory we've also tried a
different CPU as well and it's still
crashing and now the one thing I've
noticed about is someone previously has
updated the BIOS so my guess is they had
problems with this computer they tried
updating the boss it still presented the
problems hence why into say a rebooted
so and and just so yeah they've tried
essentially to fix it themselves and
they couldn't so that just essentially
gave up on this PC but not to worry we
have a contact on the Gold Coast the
king of the coast
he has a replacement motherboard for us
instead of usually would go on to
Aliexpress and order another replacement
board off there but because we want to
get this build up and running for
monster hunter ASAP we will go to the
king of the coast and get it right now
so we can finish the build so there's
that I've never seen that before phase
zero exception so this motherboard
I believe is toast let's go replace it
of course one does not just go
empty-handed to the king of the coast we
need to bring him some offerings
so it's now the next day and we did a
lot of testing the motherboard that we
got from king of the coast that was not
working as well properly so we changed
out the power supply to a thermal take
light power 550 which is a brand new one
that we just bought from the local
retailers and that's now working even
the original asrock boards working so
I've never seen a power supply cause
these kinds of issues where you'd get
such a specific problem that recurs it's
really weird like it would happen you
know you go boot up Windows and restart
so it's as if this 12 volt lines okay in
this power supply but maybe the three
volt line has been damaged before and as
I said when we were diagnosing the
problems I think this right here was a
faulty before the person sold it because
they've updated the BIOS which is a very
weird thing to do when everything is
running right on your machine so it kind
of makes sense but now we can finally
finish the build off and then see how it
performs in Monster Hunter
and now it's judgement time with the
Monster Hunter PC and as we saw before
we had to try out a new power supply
which is going to raise the cost and
bring it over that magic $200 number
unfortunately but on that note once we
got that power supply in we were able to
overclock this the 3.6 gigahertz we
could go a bit higher but the cooler is
the stock cooler so we're not gonna
spend extra money on a cooler when we
don't really need to since we're using a
GTX 780 this combination is really good
we overclock the ddr3 memory just a
little bit just to get that sweet spot
and in Monster Hunter we saw those frame
rates were extremely good with low
settings being the sweet spot on this
game so it is a very graphically
demanding game hi looks beautiful but
you will need a better graphics card
than a 780 to play this game so if the
smooth 60fps frame rates overclocking
this machine on low settings was where
it was at and of course for the budget
you definitely can't complain
trying out another game like pub G
showed that with the latest
optimizations this game ran really well
on this PC 1080p ultra was even possible
getting over 50 average FPS and the
minimums and the point 1% 1% lows
weren't that bad either firstly for me
however I do like higher than 60 fps
so medium was definitely where it was at
for me personally scoring around 70 for
average FPS with the point 1 and 1% lows
being very good as well so here it is
Monster Hunter and yes that is a Windows
Update getting ready it's just been
sitting there for a while now and that's
what happens sometimes but besides that
this PC is phenomenal value for money
it's got this different look we picked
up this case from a person selling seven
of them very cheap and I just think it
fits the whole Monster Hunter theme very
well we've got different sort of Pokemon
colors going on here on the side and the
gravis card the 780 does still perform
very well in 2018 and that older i7 even
though it's not the recommended specs
once we overclocked it a bit it can play
monster hunter world absolutely fine on
PC so never let those us recommended
minimum recommended specs sway you away
from
building a very good value for money PC
like we've got on the desk here so if
you want to get some links to search for
some of these PC parts then I will put
them in the description below but keep
in mind when it comes to deals hunting
it's always best to try and find out
local deals in your town or city as
that's where you're going to get the
best deals possible hope you guys
enjoyed this Monster Hunter world PC if
you did then be sure to slap that like
button and I look forward to reading
your comments in the comment section
below if you have any and I'll catch you
in the next tag video very soon peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
