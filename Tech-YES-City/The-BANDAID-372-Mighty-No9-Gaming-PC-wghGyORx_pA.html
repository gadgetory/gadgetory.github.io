the 7850 versus the 660ti a lot of
people wanted to see me use that
computer in a build and today I've
tallied up the cost and we've got a
three hundred and seventy two dollar
whatever
welcome back to tech yes it is Brad
coming to you guys today with a used
build that is going to be sort of like a
temporary makeshift PC while I'm
transferring the main rig from Japan to
Australia big news before that's worth
this will be kind of like the last PC
that I build from Japan unfortunately
though I will try and get in another
vlog when I use this makeshift PC so
don't worry I will do some more hunting
for you guys but in the meantime today
I'm going to be showcasing a build where
I picked up a very cheap motherboard for
$20 not only that I also got a 2500 K
for a pretty good price and it all works
out and it makes one really decent build
besides a few little things that I'll
nitpick but anyway with that being said
let's get on with the parts and the
prices and then we'll get on to the
build and then the benchmarks
Oh
all right so it's that time to see if it
boots though I'm kind of gonna be honest
with you guys it should definitely boot
because uh out of just pre overclock
before I tore it down and did the build
video for you alright there we go
let's get on with the video games
you
you
you
you
you
so then we have it the benchmarks do all
the talking for you guys and you can see
that this build at 1080p on high Oh max
settings it kind of struggled and for
$372 it certainly doesn't represent the
best value for money that i've built to
date when we contrast this build to say
something like the overwatch PC which
had the 7970 in the e 5640 ended this
thing kind of pales in comparison to
that that was like the best value for
money I've built to date it was just
king of the hill max 1080p settings
absolutely fine this thing is more or
less a 1080p medium setting PC there's
something CPU that's at fault here that
2500 K can certainly handle a 660ti and
it could certainly handle something like
a 79 70 as well I think the fault here
is maybe the 660ti is just not strong
enough to play those games at 1080p on
max or high settings the 2016 titles the
one thing that did impress me about this
build was when I started playing dota 2
with Vulcan on this 60 CTI 2500 K combo
it was really snappy the frame rates
were really high at 1080p I'm pretty
much ultra max settings at 1080p and
also the input lag was just extremely
low so if you're a competitive gamer on
dota 2 something like this 370 dollar
gaming PC will serve you really well if
you want to get into high competitive
play and you're on a budget then when we
move on to some other things with this
build like the temps they were really
good I mean for 4.6 gigahertz I was
really happy with the overclock on this
2500 K especially for a $20 cooler and
also a $20 motherboard not to mention
the CPU was secondhand and it got up to
4.6 gigahertz I was really happy with
the overclocks and also the motherboard
only had a single four pin on this so I
guess that 115 what limit wasn't a
problem with the four core CPUs also
another thing that I'll talk about
before I go is that the costs I could
have brought them down a little bit
maybe if I got a cheaper hard driver in
this case I didn't get an SSD and got
maybe a $10 hard drive and also maybe a
$5 case I could have brought this build
under $300 which at that price point I
think it would have been kick ass value
for money though since I am using this
build sorta to edit some 1080p footage
in the future I will kind of need that
SSD and I will need it to be a bit more
snappier than it usually is and also the
case I'm kind of going to shift
back and so I want a lightweight case
when I ship this thing eventually back
to Australia anyway if you guys enjoyed
this video today's and be sure to hit
that like button if you have any
questions or comments about today's 370
$2 PC then be sure to drop a comment in
the comment section below and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can and I'll
catch you in the next Tech video very
soon peace out for now bye
Oh anyway that's about it for me
together so what I did part one of my
old school showdown yeah that would be
good there's gonna be some builds coming
from down under baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
