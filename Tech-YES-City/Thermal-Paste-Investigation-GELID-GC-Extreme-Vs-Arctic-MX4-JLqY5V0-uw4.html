who made a YouTube video and all they
wanted to do was help people out and
they copped more dislikes than they did
likes and in the end they ironically
enough ended up being absolutely right
with their video and also I have to say
thank you red eye review for your video
on Arctic silver 5 vs. gel and GC
extreme this video helped me purchase
the gel and GC extreme and give the
results that I'm gonna be presenting
here today but also besides that I think
it identifies some sort of a problem
that I guess may exist still in the tech
community we will talk about that later
let's get on with the results first so I
bought a tube of this stuff 10 grams
things about 20 bucks off eBay so it's
not too expensive the good thing about
this thermal pays just like Arctic mx4
is this non capacitive non conductive so
it won't cause any problems if you spill
it as opposed to Arctic silver 5 which
I've used in the past it actually is
slightly capacitive so if you do spill
some over the edges your computer just
may not simply boot at all and I've had
fix this experience in the past but if
you do use conductive thermal paste then
do be very careful with that because
that could indeed smoke up some parts so
what we've got on the test bench here is
three different graphics cards where
I've done a little bit of
before-and-after testing and the results
are pretty conclusive this thermal paste
from gelid I was pronouncing a gallon
before that I since changed my ways is
actually working pretty well so let's
find out how well it indeed works
welcome back to tech yes City and there
is actually a story behind this because
what happened was initially I was
looking for answers because in my head
there's this big backlog of all the
things I've done in the past it all gets
cataloged in the back of the brain
there's all cause and effect and reasons
why and I've noticed in the past
whenever I've had some CPUs on different
thermal paste they've overclocked higher
than others sure it's not been a huge
difference but I've noticed whenever
I've used Arctic mx4 I've never got
great overclocks I've never got one to
say hey boys take a look at this I'm
doing really well and of course you put
that down - hey silicon lottery man
maybe just that piece of silicon is not
performing as well as others and sure
that is a valid argument but when you're
using one different thermal paste and
getting really good results and then
you're using another over time you sort
of start to say hey am I missing
something here and so I started doing a
lot more research and it wasn't till
recent with the x50 675 video that I did
that I realized that that 4.5 gigahertz
overclock that came very easy and it was
the first time I haven't used MX 4 in a
long time I actually used cooler masters
master gel Pro and so that got me
thinking I started doing a bit more
research and then I came across this
video from read I review where they
compared the M Arctic silver 5 versus
the gel at GC extreme and what they
found was there was actually quite a big
difference and first up we have the
asrock phantom gaming rx 580 now when I
put this initially to the test I was
going to do the review and I was gonna
cut the b-roll and I realized before I
took the cooler apart I was like oh make
sure I test the out-of-the-box thermals
with the stock thermal paste because
that was important for this comparison
as opposed to the previous video I did
with the GTX 10m UTI from gal axe I
actually forgot to test that before I
change the thermal paste over but
ironically enough when I tested and
looked at Greg scores I got really low
temperatures compared to him so the GC
extreme was working really well on the
1070 i sniper that i had come through
and in fact it was working so well to
the point
where I got a extremely high overclock
in real mediocre ambient temperatures so
that was already one sort of proving
factor that this thermal pace was
working well but moving over to the
asrock phantom gaming RX 580 this out of
the box was scoring I think 78 degrees
it got 100% fan speeds on its max
overclock and then we change the thermal
paste around to GC extreme and that got
75 degrees not only that it enabled us
to get a very slight extra few megahertz
out of the GPU so this was actually
working pretty well but if it's one
thing it already goes to show that
asrock are actually using some pretty
good thermal paste on their GPUs because
in the next test you'll find out why and
so the next GPU we have up here is the
gtx 1070 TI hall of fame now this is a
massive cooler three fans triple slot
it's the Big Daddy of gtx 1070 is and
it's coming to the table here first off
with arctic mx4 now I've used Arctic MX
for three years and the reason I've used
it is again because of those qualities
of not causing any problems if you spill
it it's also quite cheap you can get
like a 20 gram tube for relative like I
think I paid 14 bucks and so you can
just use it and use it use it use it use
it and you're never gonna run out of
this stuff and so it was going to go to
thermal paste before this test where it
got 63 degrees 100% fan speeds and quite
a sizable overclock of over 2.1
gigahertz and then we changed over we
change over to the magic GC extreme and
it went down to 55 degrees and not only
that I was then able to overclock it
just a little bit higher so we went from
2114 megahertz max speed to 2164 so that
was a sizable gain but we also got the
temperature drop of 8 degrees and so
this was on a 1070 I - I believe if you
had a 980 TI or a 1080 TI the
differences would be even more but now
back to the original video from redeye
review when I watched this video
everything made sense
there was no shenanigans there was no
trying to hide anything
he displayed his motherboard
temperatures and from that you could see
that his ambient temperatures were very
accurate and also on top of that he did
what's called a prime 95 small FFT test
this essentially stresses the CPU
ridiculously hard it's a very artificial
non real-world test that will if
especially in this case you've got a
fork or a threaded CPU we'll put out a
lot of power on a small surface area and
this is very important especially when
it comes down to selecting which thermal
paste will do better than others so when
I saw these tests he essentially was
showing that Arctic silver 5 was
inferior to gel a GC extreme and it all
made sense because when I looked through
his history of videos this was just a
guy who just simply wanted to help
people and yet when I looked at the
video before guy just copped more
dislikes than he did likes yet there was
no treated trash Arctic silver 5 he
didn't say anything bad about their
products he just simply did his two
tests and made a video to help people
and that's how people responded so I
asked him alike I thought he'd made a
pretty good video it helped me buy this
thermal paste and when I tested it here
myself I found some big differences so
what's coming out of this is basically
GC extreme is now my new go-to thermal
paste because it's again pretty easy to
use and it's pretty much similar in MX
for it it spreads really easy but the
temperature differences are actually
quite sizable so I hope this video helps
some people out but if it's one thing if
there's a problem that still exists in
the tech community it's that just lose
the fanboy ISM I mean sure if he was
trashing Arctic products of whatnot he
would deserve a dislike but he wasn't
doing any of that he just did some tests
and yet people hated on him because I
guess they'd bought some arctic silver 5
erotic MX 4 and thought oh you're
showing that my product that I bought
and paid money for is losing to
something else how dare you dislike yet
I'm sure going forward that would have
demotivated him
to keep making more videos but it all
comes down to I got my new favorite
thermal paste here and if something like
this helps my 8700 K
now get to 5.1 giga that's that's an
extra hundred megahertz and i guess
that's an awesome thing so if it can
help people then this stuff's really
good and i'm gonna be using it from here
on him because i can't exactly use
liquid pro or conductor naught i just i
really don't like working with that
stuff not only the fact that it's really
hard to work with but it's also
conductive so slow like this really easy
to work with it's provided with a little
spread scoop as well so you can spread
it out everywhere
I love the spread method for reasons
being that it's awesome
and that's another topic I guess you get
some people like go to put the P method
on no don't do the P method just don't
do it to yourself anyway I'm out of here
I'm losing my mind I'll catch you guys
another tech video very soon if you
enjoyed this one - be sure to hit that
like button and let me know in the
comments section below what thermal
paste are you currently using what is
your go-to thermal paste and why love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always I'll catch you in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye
but it all comes down to it I've got my
new state is it gelid yeah gelid okay
jelly jelly jelly extreme gel and GC
extreme uh there was a guy called red I
reviewed now he made a video on G lead
gelid Gilad Gilad Gilad Gilad Gilad
Gilad Gilad what if I told you there was
a person who made a video on YouTube now
I know you're thinking yeah and of
course there's people who make videos on
YouTube this is 2018
I think everyone's tried making a video
on YouTube on when I'm doing these tests
to keep it apples to apples so I was
really shocked to see that there was
such a big difference when it came to
higher power consuming devices because
an Rx 581 consume as much power as a
10-7 TTI at least from memory it
shouldn't wait now stupid I think it
does I think it does doesn't it 1070
she's about the same power overclocked
