memory has always been
their top of the line stuff.
It's always focused on
aesthetics and also performance.
Here today, we've got their
Dominator Platinum RGB.
Now, I recently came into the
H115i RGB Platinum cooler,
and I absolutely loved it.
Yes, it was expensive, but it
wasn't just the best cooler
in Corsair's lineup, it
was pretty much, I felt,
the best all-in-one out
there at the moment bar none.
As we've seen the Platinum RGB logo on the
new Dominator memory, it
definitely has a lot to live up to.
Now, I'm not gonna beat around the bush
or beat you guys around the bush,
this stuff is more expensive
than typical DDR4 memory.
It comes in many different
flavors and sizes,
I'll put a price list
up here for you guys,
so you can check it out yourself.
So, what we've got here, first
of all the build quality,
forged, anodized aluminum.
It's got also black on black PCB,
and that PCB itself is 10-layered PCB.
The more layers you have on the PCB,
the better it is for reducing noise,
and hence better for over-clocking.
Coupled with that, the
top part is then made
of die-cast zinc alloy, and
the fins are stamped aluminum.
So you can really start
to see that a lot is going
into the design of this, not
just to make it look pretty,
but also to perform better
where Corsair's emulating
their DHX dual-channel cooling technology,
which apparently has the
metal closer-integrated
to the DIMMs themselves,
which then initially draws
away the heat and then helps
to draw away the heat further
compared to other DDR4 memory.
I will be putting this to
the test later in this video.
But also, another point
about this Dominator memory
is it features new Capellix
RGB lighting system,
with 12 individually back-lit zones,
that don't need any extra
cables, they just fit
into your DIMM slots and
run off the DIMM slots' power itself.
I'm told this lighting system
is pretty much exclusive
to Corsair at the moment, and of course,
as you can see in some
of the B-roll already,
it allows the light to
come through more evenly,
brighter, and also doing
so using less power.
So, basically, in a nutshell,
this is where technology's going,
and as it stands, this
RAM is going straight
onto my test system.
We're gonna start over-clocking!
(calm techno music)
So now, just finished the temperature test
and I decided to test the
Dominator Platinum here,
versus the only other
four sticks that I had
on hand that would accept
the exact same XMP profiles
as the Dominator, and that was
the G.SKILL Flare X memory.
And so, four sticks versus four sticks,
the Corsair came in with
49 degrees, 50 degrees,
49 degrees and 46 degrees
after 15 minutes of testing,
and then on the surface with
my IR camera, got 47 degrees.
This is in a 29 degree
ambient environment,
so it is the Aussie
summer, but think of it as
the worst-case scenario,
which in this case,
for stress testing, is
actually a really good thing.
Moving on to the G.SKILL
memory, came in with
57 degrees, 59 degrees, 58 degrees, 55
from software readouts, then
with the temperature sensor,
it read 61 degrees on the surface,
that was the max temperature reported,
so the Corsair memory is
coming in a lot better
when it comes to keeping
the temperatures down.
This is probably due to
the heat sinks themselves
weighing 98 grams versus 45
grams in total for the memory
on the Corsair Dominator
versus the G.SKILL Flare X.
Now, in terms of other
memory that G.SKILL have,
I'm pretty sure that the Flare
X isn't their best memory
that they have for sale,
I think their Trident Z
Royal stuff is currently
the best memory they
have, but I don't know
how that will perform.
They said they were gonna
send some over a while ago,
never got any in here to test.
But regardless, if you guys
know another memory set
that you'd like to see the
Dominator go up against,
let us know in the comments section below.
But, as it stands, this
is really good news
for the Dominator Platinum
RGB, because it means that it's
not just aesthetics and bling.
They actually do put a lot of time
into making the performance top-notch.
But that aside, let's
check out the over-clocking
on this stuff.
(calm techno music)
So, after over-clocking with DDR4 memory,
it can get finicky, it can
get a little bit crazy,
and that's what happened this time around.
We did get two of the
sticks to 4 gigahertz
at CL 19, at 1.4 volts.
That was really impressive.
Then, the other pair got to 3.9 gigahertz
at the same CL 19, 1.4 volt.
But when I tried to put all
four sticks in together,
it would only go to 3.6
gigahertz effective,
so maybe it's the board in this case,
I mean DDR4 memory can get really finicky
when it comes to over-clocking
and setting in certain things,
but in the case of this
Dominator memory here,
at least if you get it in a
pair on most motherboards,
this stuff here goes to 3.9 gigahertz.
So it's really impressive
speeds, especially at CL 19.
So, this stuff for the test
bench is definitely looking like
it's going to be really good
when it comes to testing out,
not just the CPU, which
can get to 5 gigahertz,
the 1900K, but also this Dominator stuff,
which can theoretically
should get to 3.9 gigahertz
across all four sticks.
But in this case, it's just not,
because it's just been released,
maybe ASRock have to update the
BIOS on the Taichi Ultimate.
With that aside, let's
go over now and check out
the RGB bling on the top of this memory
and how you can control it,
what patterns they have,
and what you can do
with the iCUE software.
(calm techno music)
Now's the time to look at aesthetics
and controlling those aesthetics.
The iCUE software is pretty
much the best in the game
for controlling RGB software.
You've got layers, but
within those layers,
you can control different
settings and different patterns.
In this case, you've
got 16 to choose from,
there's also the audio which will react
if you've got a Corsair pair
of headphones plugged in.
My personal favorites
in this case were the
sequential effect and also the stack,
as well as color wave.
And you can control the
speeds and directions.
Also in terms of setting
up your DIMMs in order,
you can get a visual
confirmation of the order
and what motherboard and set the direction
of the DIMMs themselves.
So, you can get exact control
in the iCUE software itself.
It's very detailed, and
they've even improved it
to the point where it's
much more responsive
than it was when I took a last look at it
when I was testing out
the previous DDR4 memory
with RGB on it.
It's come a long way, to the point where
it's practically near perfection.
I really like what Corsair
have done with the iCUE,
and also the control on this DDR4 memory.
However, one thing with
the DDR4 memory itself,
this time around I couldn't
opaque the layers out,
in other words, I couldn't
have multiple layers
in use with the DDR4 memory.
Perhaps that's a limitation
without plugging in
additional cabling to the DDR4 memory,
which I'm sure nobody wants.
Anyway guys, in a nutshell,
the Dominator Platinum RGB
memory is simply the real deal.
It's not just aesthetics as
we saw with the over-clocking
and temperatures, it's also
the performance as well.
Yes, it will be some of
the most expensive memory
out there, but granted,
you get what you pay for.
If you pay for this memory,
you're gonna simply get
the best in the business.
That's what I'm slowly starting to realize
with the Platinum branding
on Corsair's products.
It's not just the best product
within their own lineup of products,
it's pretty much the best in the industry
for whatever you're gonna use it for.
For instance, the H115i,
as I said in the intro,
the Platinum RGB, that thing's amazing,
this memory here, absolutely amazing.
Anyway guys, with that said,
I'm gonna get on outta here
and start building up this potato
I've got on the desk over there.
I mean, this thing is
like, the worst in the biz.
So, we're going from the best in the biz
to the worst in the biz,
that's how things go
around here at Tech YES
City, I don't know why,
that's just sometimes how it is.
If you guys enjoyed this
one, then be sure to
hit that like button.
Also let us know in the
comments section below,
what you think of the
Dominator Platinum RGB memory.
It is honestly the best
DDR4 memory I've come into,
and if you guys saw me at CES last year,
I was coming into a lot of DDR4 memory.
Build quality and also
the over-clockability here
for air over-clocks is phenomenal
in hot ambient temperatures.
And, with that said, I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon.
Peace out for now, bye.
Also guys, sub buttons down there,
little bell icon, if you click that,
you'll get the videos the
moment they're released.
Also, Instagram, TechYESCity.
If you wanna get that inside scoop,
the potato build,
the pre-potato build's
actually posted up there.
And also, for patrons, I
will put the sub-timings
because it's very difficult
to over-clock DDR4 memory,
you need all the sub-timings especially
on this ASRock board.
I'll post them up on Patreon,
and I'll catch you in the next one, bye.
(calm techno music)
(beep)
Now in terms of other
memory that G.SKILL have,
I'm pretty sure that the Flare X isn't
their best memory that they have for sale,
I think their Trident Z,
um, golden mirror stuff--
