and that is that the RX for ats
officially going to hit the stores on
jun 29th and there's also going to be a
lot of stock available at launch let's
find out more about this welcome back to
take acid is brand coming to you guys
there were some more juicy news on the
RX 484 70 m 460 and the release date is
pretty much concrete now with jun 29th
with according to an article at wccftech
they've contacted a micro center in the
states which has confirmed 100 units to
be shipped in on jun 28th and then
subsequently released on jun 29th now
these hundred units is 25 times more
than they had for the gtx 1080 at launch
so if that's any indicator to go by we
will be seeing a lot more stock at
release date for the RX 480 then as
opposed to the GTX 10 series also a leak
slide from newegg show the RX 488
gigabyte addition to be released at
around about two hundred forty dollars
on launch that sleight has since been
taken down and it's now been changed to
coming soon let's see the majority of
the board partners or all the cards
there are the eight gigabyte 480
variants there so it remains to be seen
on the other stock levels of the four
7460 and even the four gigabyte edition
of the RX for a tee but one thing for
sure is that the a gigabyte r x 480 will
be in large quantities on release those
who can see without coming soon slide
there all the models listed are
unfortunately the reference style
coolers only which even though the
reference cooler this time around does
look very cool very sleek it's still
won't perform anywhere near as good as a
custom cooling solution from a decent
board partner video cars.com has also
released an early slide there showing
the fire strike scores on the RX 480 and
we can see the particular cards in
crossfire with one of the cards hitting
87 degrees in a fire strike run which is
a little bit concerning since these
cards were reported to be running really
cool though when i get my hands on it i
will test for you guys what these things
are capable of and i'm sure it's nothing
that a good couple of zip ties and a
decent cooler will be able to fix and
also looking into this article further
we can see the AMD is including a new
overclocking utility which does look
pretty sleek and clean so i can't wait
to try that the West for me personally
I'll be doing my best to get you guys a
review on day one of a retail sample
show you guys the temperatures the
overclocking all the good
the bad and the ugly with this card and
I've also got a GTX 1017 on Founders
edition on backorder and I'm still going
to be waiting for that I don't know
exactly when i'll get that i may even
get an RX for 80 in before i get the
1070 and that's how bad the supplies are
for the 1070 here in my country where
I'm at at the moment sorry guys let me
know what you're doing in the
conversation below are you going to be
getting one of these graphics cards on
launch where are you gonna be getting a
GTX 1070 or whatnot let me know in the
comments I'd love to read it and hear
your thoughts and if you haven't already
hit that like button and I'll catch you
guys in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye
see this thing knows what's up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
