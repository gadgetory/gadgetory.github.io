streaming and guys welcome back to
episode 16 of the tech lounge and hope
y'all are doing very well i'm joined by
kev from tech showdown how you don't
have had a great brian has been been
really fun just trying to get through a
lot of content just like you so we can
have plenty of time to go every go over
every nook and cranny of risin yeah the
rough stuff starts to go live yay
exactly the risin stuff is going to be
pretty damn big isn't it so a big
revolution in the taxi everyone's
gearing up for this everyone just keeps
going on oh my god rising it everywhere
you turn everyone's talking about rising
it's insane so I can't wait personally I
think it's going to be awesome I think
people have been waiting for this it's
it's been in the making for years and
it's finally coming so in a few days a
few days it's going to hit you guys and
we're gonna see what this thing does to
the market it's a rebel late it's
already shaking things up from what we
hear your first article intel's already
responding this is actually legit this
article's legit i'm checking it out now
microcenter dropping these prices as
they say how we've got a heap of price
cuts on the intel CBS's before it rises
even out yeah before these things even
out we've got price cuts so yeah this is
what a lot of people you know you can't
say you were surprised by this because a
lot of us expected this to happen Intel
had been doing very well in terms of
margins for quite some time so of course
as soon as rising came out they were
going to change that and yeah we see a
lot of drops there especially on the
broad well II range which is again
something we also expect it to see
bigger drops there and everything else
but it's good for ya it consumers out
there obviously you know saves you a bit
of money if you are still keen to go
towards until I guess after all the
testing comes out with rising yeah we'll
be able to see it you know it works out
this is why competitions good
bring prices down but in another year I
think of 5820 can achieve X number 11
sex 2 99's released I think it x.x 99
motherboard in a 58 20k or for example
that might become a good used price
performance value play hmm because I
honestly I've between the 6800 k in the
58th 20k I thought there was bugger-all
difference because the 58 20k clocked
higher I found it clocked actually a lot
higher my went to 4.6 stable this thing
only has a 4.3 max so these are max vs
max and of course I drop it down 100
megahertz because diminishing returns
but 4.2 vs. 4.5 I mean there's your
there's your performance gains all gone
down the window from a new cpu
architectural yeah exactly yeah so was
about I mean this is this was something
we I think it's it's really bad timing /
Intel as well I mean kb lake launched
and didn't make much of a splash and
there wasn't a huge amount of hype
around it either especially after all
the issues with temperatures started
coming out so i think yeah aim DS in a
very very good position right now with
the risin launch Intel's looking
probably the weakest they've looked in a
very long time in terms of their
position in the market and the the
consumer cpu market that is yeah well
that's on me they've live worried
they're like okay guys we've been
sitting on our backsides for years and
they have I mean we just four years
we've been getting trickled out crap and
you know until have the rd to do a
little bit better i think i would assume
yeah they would have the rd to do a bit
better than they've been doing and
that's what we've all been disappointed
about we've been getting these
performance gains just trickle down not
only that we've been getting been seeing
things like thermal patchy thermal paste
on our cpus it's in ways it's like the
consumer has been insulted that much
that they're just fed up even these
price cuts these even going to be enough
to persuade people to go
not by a rising sea view by an intel cpu
yeah I would say yeah I mean my
prediction from the very start so this
isn't any new information or anything
guys but that what I predicted from the
very start was rising and I suspect once
i start my own testing that i'll be
proved correct is that the
multi-threaded performance will be
absolutely excellent so the people that
will be using it for productivity stuff
they're going to have an absolute blast
well we've been a scene though so we've
already seen that we're ready see ya a
lot of the leaks and specialist units
and that's the one benchmark you just
need to see and say okay this thing max
calls max threads max overclock it's
performing like this this is what it
theoretically can do max so but yeah yes
I think that's very good but I always
said that key be lakewood still have a
place because of its extremely good
single threaded performance and i really
do think that will be the case and
overclocked still mean the thing go I'm
I know is the pipeline one gig goods I
mean that's huge 51 1 gigahertz is huge
yeah i mean the heat will always be a
huge detractor from people going to key
be like but yeah i really really think
that that that will after all the dust
to settle that will be how the market
place will sort of end up is that people
still be going towards the cubic cpus
for that very fast very good single
threaded performance but people and that
will make me and you Brian who wants a
cpu that's going to be great for
productivity stuff but also great for
well you know decent for good enough for
gaming will be going towards risin now
instead of broadway lee and your guy
like in that so i think that's where
Intel should be most worried well this
time there's still there's still a lot
of information to come out like you know
when of the six scores coming out one of
the four cores coming out a lot of
people going to be waiting for those
because 329 box is still expensive
considering you're probably going to
have to
couple it with a nice solid X 370
motherboard right you're not going to be
able to just get this thing on a dirt
cheap multiple it's eight core 16
threats going to need some solid vrm
there so that yeah a lot of people
waiting for the four current six core
variants but yeah that's that's my
argument as well if the performance is
good enough it doesn't have to be 7700 k
at five point one gigahertz performance
if it's if it's good enough and it
smashes the old-school 8350 out of the
park then that's all they really need
and especially if the productivity is
there I mean we really know the
productivities there from AMD's only
that sooner badger school is pretty much
going to guarantee that this thing is
going to kick ass in productivity that's
your guarantee but I and I voiced my
concerns about that jewel CPU design you
know interconnected I've been voicing it
for a while it's something to you can
ignore because I've had jewels eons I've
gamed on dual xeons for six months I
know or at least six months I forgot how
exactly how long i did but i've gained
on these things for six months I know
their weaknesses for me it felt like the
dual xeons had this inherent input lag
as opposed to a single CPU setup not
only that you got local frames and then
even people are telling me in the
comment section that one cpu of that a
five 2670 will perform better than two
so like that this is one cpu set
performing better to sew a dual cpu
design of course it's completely
different they've got a 2017 or 2014
architecture versus how old sandy bridge
is but of course there's some variants
there bit and you know you got to see be
using physical sockets versus one cpu
but still the core thing of having two
CPUs interconnected is still there
that's still there how's that gonna be
yeah yeah yeah yeah I get what you're
saying and I think you're completely
right so um I mean yeah um I think we
agree here that might for productivity
stuff I have no worries at all i think
reisen is going to be absolutely
fantastic for it so if you were someone
out there who's looking or was looking
to build a workstation and there are a
lot of you guys out there because a few
people have hit me up
to ask about it I would say definitely
just wait this next well we only have to
wait another week basically less than a
week even for all the rows and
benchmarks come out then really take a
look to be one hundred percent sure and
then I would go towards those eight core
raisin CPUs because that will be
absolutely excellent forearm all your
productivity stuff I mean I went from a
4770k sir for four core eight thread CPU
a child soon productivity stuff on as
well all my video rendering in that and
and it does it you know it'll get you by
but man after i went to the 6900 k oh
it's so much better the rendering times
are cut in half you know everything was
just much more smooth it's just a much
better experience way way more time
efficient well to be honest I mean I i
thought the sixth corps was a great
balance it's a great balance for even me
doing video editing having skype
conversations up at that that's 16 core
32 threaded beast that i had man that
one thing was great you could just do
everything at the same time and not have
a hiccup like you could be rendering
that video playing a game talking on
skype listening to music making a
thumbnail when you die in dota 2 late
you do all this stuff at the same time
that it just wasn't one slow down i
really loved that aspect of course
you've got to remember that the more
multitasking you do though generally the
more ram you're going to want as well
don't ignore that factor you know
because there was again i copped this
for a few videos i remember a few videos
people just kept telling me you don't
need 64 gigabytes of ram yeah 32 it's
like no way for me i need 64 gigabytes
of ram have to have it so it might kind
of setup I have to have it because I
sometimes are loading a hundred
gigabytes of footage for a 4k cut you
know I usually want to do my videos I
overtake I overshoot like I will not
sometimes I won't even use half the
amount of b-roll that took in one video
yeah just because I like it's just
better to be safe than sorry I'd rather
just have I've got the camera there wise
will do all the beer all shoot it all
and then drop it into Adobe Premiere Pro
and be like okay let's get this video
nice and fresh
and everyone's going to love it so but
that's 100 gigabytes I need sees will
give us a rampant not even a healthy not
even a conversation ended up talking
about memory but anyway price cuts
they're real they're coming so if you
were the guys who you know I'm sure
there's a few guys out there they're
gonna be like look I want to get an
intel cpu I just I don't trust AMD
there's going to be those guys you can
now get it with a price cut so yeah yeah
and of course the empty help to the ad
pre-ordering I'd see if you're going for
productivity that's a guaranteed sell I
really want to get my hands on it to see
how it does in gaming I've got my
reservations just because of the jewel
zealand's I want to test it I really
want to get in-depth testing done for
you guys I can't wait to do that
hopefully I'll be able to get a day 1
review be pushing it for time I mean
what's 33 days so this thing's release
pretty much three days day yeah yeah I'm
not sure if that's going to be the sort
of like is it isn't trying to explain to
people being a Australian or New Zealand
tech youtubers like having a handicap
it's like being a tech youtuber on hard
mode because you're always so delayed we
always have to wait so much longer than
everybody else especially especially New
Zealand man oh no that's a shocker it
takes stuff so long and to get here so
have you ever thought it broke okay have
you ever thought did you get your
passport you got your zpass but I mean
getting you zealand parts but you live
in Oz anytime you want if you ever
thought just cash in a plane coming over
just live in here I mean half my family
lives in Australia ready so where you
can be that um that difficult but I
think often the new zealand lives in
australia at the moon it's actually been
going the other way lately haha more us
he's coming here thank you is going
there but um the yeah i mean it is it is
something i have thought about in the
past but now it's just one of those
things but even i'll see you like like
even i see your videos are often times
with something a launch you'll see all
the Americans and Canadians put out all
their content and then like a week later
of course they're going to get first
dibs they got the mat they got the
biggest market in the world
so yes without it goes without saying
yeah yeah let's try it's pretty good i
find the i mean we do bitch about prices
a lot and I'd say about fifty percent of
the times it's warranted yeah the prices
are pretty stupid but prizes like Jesus
if you guys are in eyes and you think
prices are bad just wait until you head
to some other places in the world holy
 they get bad like they get real bad
you know I was on holiday at Christmas
we've stopped through New Caledonia
factually so going to make a video on
that but they didn't even have a
computer shop open on a on a weekday so
I couldn't even like it was there it was
that bad all they had was lay a few like
game stops not even again wasn't called
gamestop was like some rip off of that
and there's some headphones like razor
headphones 100 bucks I was like okay
this is living a living it up boys so
yeah exactly i mean the thing is with
new zealand is that it's not so much the
retailers fault it's just the
distributors in australia want to take a
cut as well before they send things on
to new zealand so basically the products
come in from whichever country they're
manufactured they go to the aussie
distributors they prioritize australian
retailers first so they all get all the
products first then whatever's left over
they send over to the new zealand
retailers they also um will take their
cut which means the prices go up even
higher in new zealand and that's why new
zealand tech cost more than oz you tick
even if you account for the different
currency wasn't it what's your arm
what's your import thresholds in
Australia we got a thousand bucks man so
you can order like anything you want
from amazon and you get it for good
prices i just recently ordered a RX 470
it's going on amazon for like 150 bucks
with that $20 rebate that $20 rebate is
an international rebate so damn like do
you order much from amazon straight to
New Zealand really I usually i buy i try
buy locally whenever i can i'm sort of a
i'm a bit of a patriot i like i like
supporting the new zealand retailers as
much as I guess I don't sort of hard to
yeah it's hard for them to compete a lot
of the time so I like to support local
business and it gets rewarded because
companies like high tech support me so
right on the nose full circle but our
yes oh that's just there's my way of
doing things but yeah that's sort of why
it's difficult but we're making there's
all I can tell you guys right now is
that there's plenty of inquiries being
made and there's lots of talk behind the
scenes so i'll be bringing you rising
content as soon as i possibly can as
soon as possible probably as fast as
anybody else in the ceiling could
possibly start doing what if flash
lightning comes over New Zealand bro
then you're done okay anyway let's go
rison ok so next article here rising
over clock frequency bundles so the MSA
range of aim for boards basically with
their game boost knobs have figured out
what the pre boost settings are and so
what we've got here is essentially we
got a list here and it shows you all
those clock settings on the motherboard
here so interesting indicator it would
give you an idea that they've tested
behind closed doors I really liked this
article because it's sort of like hey ms
I have done all the testing behind
closed doors and this is what we're
seeing based on their BIOS settings it's
kind of like a very intuitive leak I
like it I like this article yeah it's
pretty good although if we look further
down in the article it has something
that we already do know about because
obviously brain runs the 6800 ki run a
6900 k and there's the broadway lee
one's actually run an MSA exhaling
motherboard so i can tell you because
i've tried this out before so you'll see
going down there's you know 4.4 4.6 4.5
4.7 those stage 10 and 11 ones I can
tell you for a fact a 6900 k good luck
you'd have to have the golden ship to
get those sorts of frequencies out of a
6900 k now I've done it on stage 8 to
4.3 it will go to 4.3 but it's not the
most happy chappy there but 4.2 it's
extremely happy so stage sex on this it
will be
um yes happy is Larry at that amount so
then if we take that logic which isn't
extremely sound but but let's let us
roll with it anyway and apply it to the
the raisin ones then we can say that
stage eight is probably the one which
the majority of people will be able to
take them so that will mean I was going
to say stage a will stay Jake I think it
got me too i think it was 4.9 i forgot
off me i remember i do my msi
motherboard is 4.9 gigahertz I think
stage 8 was around about it it was right
about the sweet spot so yes guesstimate
would be like stage 10 and stage 11 you
know kill your CPU stages so yeah like
on air on air anyway you don't have some
really damn good water cooling but I'd
say Stage six and stage eight would be
around about your estimate of the max
sort of overclocks on a decent Bend chip
chip and so we see here that we can see
the range right we've got about four
point three gigahertz to 4.1 gigahertz
would that be safe to assume that that's
where the majority of verizon CPUs will
end up I think so yeah I would agree
with that also I think it does seem like
they're not going to be um I mean the
the funniest thing about this is i
honestly when i first looked at that
graph I thought it was round the wrong
way I was expecting those quad cores to
be the higher overclockers rather than
the beat a course it's I don't know how
I could explain it in an easy way but
it's sort of the reason part of the
reason why things like kb lake can
overclock so much better well there's a
there's a lot of reasons there but um
the yeah they're been viable I mean 71
decay is the cream of the crop on the
four core yeah like that's the cream is
the best of the best there then you go
into a different you know different
manufacturer on the six core 2 10 core
so you've got the four core been the
cream of crab you got this time around
we're pretty certain everyone certain
that it's just the eight core is the
cream of the crop and then you're
skewing down to the four core all on the
same
manufacture there so it remains to be
seen but this is what it's looking like
your four cores not as good as your sex
call you see schools not as good as you
eight core not just in the fact that
there might be something faulty on that
cpu but also in the in the bin as well
maybe this is too early to tell I'd say
that they're all gonna say I'd say
overall they're all going to be much the
same i guess because they're already
releasing the 1700 which I do kind of
assume that the 1800 x is going to be
the cream of the crop versus the 1780
I'd imagine that have a smart bidding
process because yeah yeah I can't
imagine them charging 170 bucks just for
some just for turbo noobs you know what
I mean like a ureter bueno you got a
hydrant 70 bucks yeah like and then of
course we got the ln2 score as well
where was around about 5.3 or something
wasn't it they maxed out on ya got
pretty yeah there's already up there so
I would say I mean this is also you guys
may be guys that don't do much
overclocking there is a lot of people
will just overclocked and a lot of CPUs
automatically will overclock one core um
much higher than the others for your
single threaded applications what I'm
gathering from this if I if I can go off
what set what ms I've done in the past
were Broadway Lee this will mean 4.3 on
all 8 cores not just on the single one
so there are there any turbo nerds out
there in the comments go represent guys
to say I'm a turbo new it sir we'll be
getting will be addressing that light of
it just yes so I think that that'll be
something else but if thats meaning 4.3
across all eight then you can possibly
get it up a higher if you were just
doing it on a single core rather than
going across it really depends on what
you want the reason why I do it across
all 8 on my 6900 k is because the
primary reason why use that cpu is
productivity I want all 8 cores going
hard so when I do rendering and other
things you know it
works out well but if you're not doing
any productivity type stuff then you'll
just be wanting one core going super
hard because of that's what a lot of
games will require it maybe not so much
going for it but we will have to see um
but yeah that's funny i'm looking at his
i'm looking at these bundles here it's
like five hundred eighty pounds for a
AMD 1700 at be 350 + 8 gigabytes of ddr4
me I'm just kind of wondering who who
would want to get an eight-core 16
threaded CPU and then 8 gigabytes of
ddr4 like it's a bit of a dumb bundle
like you'd want and want at least 16
gigabytes of RAM with an eight quarts
come on guys just say it's sort of funny
though if you think about it because a
lot of people have been showing
different bundles that you can get with
that AMD 1700 are seven 1700 and showing
that you can actually build an entire
system for the same price as just buying
the Intel 6900 k CPU you know because
it's so ridiculous they've got to do
they will not ask you down here for 300
bucks the pro 1700 so to be determined
that's interesting yeah I don't know
what what those Pro ones are to do with
I have actually asked around and you no
one else seems to know either so I don't
have no idea why be not over close one
so maybe possibly who knows but why
would you what why do they need that
much of a spread well because if you
will I mean if you've got if you've got
a non overclockable model then you can
just put the absolute crap estuve the
crap of the bin oh no not overclocked
and you keep everyone happy someone's
getting a CPD for 299 bucks yeah so just
just I'm just putting that out there
I've been probably wrong but we got here
now there's a lot of worry going on at l
allegedly playing dirty to undercut AMD
rising so we've seen this in the past
until have been fined two times i
believe is 2009 the EU decision 1.4
billion dollar fine then in the year
states they were they were caught with a
big fine I mean these guys are just
thrown vines for anti-competitive
practices whether you know they were
just getting HP and Dell and stuff like
that and they like you guys use our CPUs
will throw you know will pay off some
money give you a bit of a deal I don't
usually out of this product you know
don't do it so they've been found guilty
of that and they've even been found
going on the record as saying dell loves
money so yeah there's a lot of pretty
the the worst one I found from the FTC's
findings was the Intel page / coerce
software and hardware vendors to not
support or to limit their support for
AMD CPUs this includes having vendors
label their wares as Intel compatible
but not AMD compatible it's little
things like that and it's like come on
and tell you know like just cut it out
you don't need to carry on like that
you've been at the top of the market for
a long time now you don't really need
this and I mean it was at 1.25 billion
dollar settlement for unfair and
deceptive conduct so I mean was it
really worth it you just you do stupid
to be honest though that should be
honest you 1.25 billion was it was it
worth it though that's the thing that
would be like if you're looking at this
for my fuel monetary standpoint would it
have been worth because you've got to
account for all the negative images like
the negative image that amd's suffered
over the years could have this directly
affected AMD's ability to make a better
processor back in the day and I'd say
yes there's so many augmented things
that could have happened if they were
certainly more cpus you know maybe a 2.6
billion intel can afford a can absorb
that oh hell yeah they mean what in one
quarter they probably spend more than
that on ray rd so they can absorb the
costs and they knocked AMD out they just
they hammered them by doing this stuff
in the past that are not good right I
mean that's the thing right I'd say 2.6
billion that almost I'd say they might
even be doing they might have been doing
better off they might have been laughs
at this I don't know because they just
completely destroyed AMD before like now
rising we're gonna see how risin does
but
before that they just completely
destroyed them and maybe 2.6 billion
wasn't enough or whatever so you know
really where does it go so I'm just
wondering because there's so many things
that we're not thinking of it so that
the negative image that I empty suffered
over the years I they're super user you
know this and that and their ability to
not make a better cpu due to having to
push these court battles and then get
paid out in 2009 or in 2010 or whatever
so you can see that those crucial years
was like the downfall and it was just
like it was a snowball in like the other
way like one company's gone this way the
other companies gone that way so is that
worth 2.6 billion I don't know I don't
know I mean the thing is is that if they
tried if something that this happened
again I think the negative publicity um
alone would really really hurt them if
they try to do something like this all
right now that we're all wired in see
now that social media and what this with
the internet like everyone's widened now
so yeah I really don't think they can
pull this off again back then they could
2005-2006 it wasn't it was kind of like
you know I don't know tech like the
enthusiast tech scene was still
underground very underground mm-hm so
nowadays though it's a completely
different story everyone's waiting
everyone's making videos every once
again but everyone's the Czech people
wait a min everyone's got a tablet if
they don't have a pc they got a tablet
they can check news so and I don't know
be interesting to see is until you know
do they own shares of news companies I
don't know but if they don't if they
don't if they don't own shares and use
companies the news companies aren't
going to care they just going to report
straight away to get views it's how the
world works actually and is this
business is a deadly businesses a deadly
environment or it can be anyway so I
think that's the difference now as well
as that in the olden days you know
people could do that but nowadays with
all the amount of you know all these
independent sites like the ones we get
on go on and stuff I mean you can't big
companies can't cover the tracks
absolutely
where and so there's going to be people
reporting on it yet they might be able
to do something dodgy with the
mainstream media but people will still
find out about it and and people in the
industry will certainly hear about as
well and they're the ones that might
change I mean if you think if Intel does
dodgy stuff like this it's this server
market their server CPU sales which are
really propping them up and if they do
enough stuff like that then maybe people
in the industry will start to get a
negative opinion and go over to the
Naples risin well that's if that's where
AMD we already know that's where AMD's
going to hit really hard is in the
server they need to have all that there
they want to take some money off Intel's
hands man they're going to go I've heard
around the industry that there's a lot
of chatter about that like oh yeah more
than you would think you look at those
but you look at those prodigies yeah but
you look at those productivity scores
men there they're pretty much they're so
highly correlated to a server workload
SQL and whatnot so that is really good
for AMD that's why fast gamers we're
really just the guys who love gaming we
want the performance we lazy this is all
the whole communities based around but
all the money is in the server industry
yeah and that sort of that's and I'd say
those results are highly correlated with
work state by workstation productivity
benchmarks so when those benchmarks are
good generally your server benchmarks
would be pretty much hand in hand so you
can expect rise in to hit really hard in
the server industry really damn hard and
I think that's what yeah yeahs tells not
I'm end of course but we're just hearing
this stuff here like until allegedly
sending out emails call us before you're
right guys so a just hold on on that
rising review we just want to check it
out you know so make sure you got the
Excel pricing right in your review these
things quite scared and and they really
should be I mean I've been hearing
things that Intel are really
prioritizing going to seven Anna meat
for their server CPUs to quickly counter
I don't know how quickly but to
counter the rise in Naples that it's not
cool it's just called Naples a I'm sorry
I have been read about it for a little
while it's okay Vince fun I can't
remember that I can't remember the
actual full name I just know Naples is
there but that's going to be it's a
16-core a and a 32 I believe yeah the
top of my head which that is that's
getting pretty serious well I think they
go to they going for a really big core
count to even higher than Intel's I just
remember reading that off the top of my
head but again you know the server
industry as much as I you know like it's
where all the money's at it's not my
passion right I'd say Wendell would
definitely be able to give you a lot
more insight into the server industry
you know that's his that's his cell way
you guys still have to get him back home
at some point it just talked to him a
lot about that stuff after all this rise
and stuff as I know I'm down a bit we
can talk to him all about this because
yeah he'll have some very different
tests i'm sure in his review that sort
of no other review will touch on like
you'll just be like look do it for this
this this is missing you should be
sitting back and pale when don't give me
more you know that's Wendell Wendell is
terribly I mean when with you know as me
and Brian are both um tic youtubers we
can sort of tell who knows their stuff
and who doesn't just from our own
personal knowledge and honestly out of
all the tech youtubers i watch Wendell
is the top dog he really really knows
his stuff and that's not to disparage
anybody else know the feeling really
smart but Wendell is really on to it now
well I'm going to Wendell's like the guy
Wendell's like the guy who was in it
from the beginning kind of like he was
in it you know before all the aim DK six
and stuff it was fiddling with tech back
and like the you know early 90s or what
it letters that's Wendell you know soon
as he was a young yeah since he was a
young kid he was feeling attack yeah I
mean this is that this other smart you
know really smart people i'm steve from
hardware unboxed i mean Steve's and oh
geez well seasoned OG yeah he's been
gone a real long time sir
the Steve's really on to it as well
there's this really smart you know tech
youtubers out there but yeah that's the
yeah because we will look into this more
in the future because you know it might
not that might you know it may seem a
bit boring to you guys this actually
means a lot because a lot of times the
companies will prioritize a lot of rd
especially when they're going to be
changing their manufacturing process for
the server market because the they can
charge a lot for the CPUs which sort of
can make up a lot of that R&amp;amp;D costs you
know when they're charging several
thousand dollars for each see you that
can justify it a lot more so much kind
of has a trickle down type effect in the
sense that though they'll go crazy with
the assoc abuse and that'll trickle I'm
gonna give you guys an example of how
much money they can make off a cpu now
if they're cutting money ok let's look
at the G 45-60 ok pentium pentium what
not it's the exact same cpu on a
hardware standpoint as a 7700 k exact
same thing there's just things have been
disabled that's all it is things have
been disabled so you've got the exact
same piece of hardware same PCB same
died on board exact same stuff and
you're paying sixty dollars versus 330
dollars all that extra monies just go on
to intel i mean sure if they're doing
the rd and they're doing the work then
they deserve that money but that's where
people question until are they doing the
work I we've been getting trickled out
crap for years so that's just to give
you an idea and same with a 1700 it's
going to be the exact same as the 1800 x
from a hardware store it's gonna be the
exact same thing bph 170 bucks for
hopefully a better bin that's pretty
fair I'm think that's pretty fair yeah
sixty dollars versus 330 dollars you can
start to see the picture yeah yeah yeahs
with those with the og's you know like
we got Wendell he's an OG hardware guy
like he came into it you know and and
Steve these guys were into it from the
very start with Hardware in mind I don't
know about you man but I came in like
holds a noob in my teenage days I just
wanted to build a gaming computer to
play games and then as I became washed
out like as you get older guys you can
think if you're young
if you're young at the moment and you're
pretty good at gaming just enjoy it
because you're gonna be washed up in ten
years time and then that's not and then
that's when you get into hardware and
you helped all the young guys out so
that's why you know it's very i pat
myself on the back every time I can help
a young guy out and you get get him good
frames get him a good gaming experience
he's gonna enjoy it a lot more than me
me now I just get frustrated you know
when dota 2 when someone kicks my ass
mid one v one I just you know I get
schooled a lot more because I know back
in 2010 when i was playing mid one verse
one in here as a new earth i could
school that guy yeah I'll school and
guys left front center even schooled one
of the pros mid one be one but now I
can't do that i'm just getting schooled
by noobs so done man yes washed up guys
even got the gray hairs to prove it so
alright so okay so we got the AMD right
this is just a backup article you know
how Intel could outmuscle AMD i just i
don't think it's going to be real this
time I hope it's not real because look
we've got the cinebench schools already
out there you can't now everyone knows
how rise and performs maximum threads
maximum cause and you know how it
performs so if there's other
productivity benchmarks coming out and
it's like Oh Intel is just absolutely
slamming AMD is your kind of going to
look at the scratch your head and be
like why is that now so all the door the
news is out there everything's out there
verizon performs really well I don't
think they can outmuscle them through
software manipulation anymore i think
that's out the window hopefully it is so
yeah I would I yeah I don't think it
would be that possible anymore not
without some big pushback from kinetic
you're all white and stay why didn't
goes stay wide in that's what we got to
do gonna keep a support because yeah AMD
needs support now as well so they've got
a good product they've got a legit good
product I want to see them come back I
mean it's good for you guys even if even
if you are the biggest intelli fanboy
you want AMD to do well because all
that's going to do out of
for Intel is a they'll drop prices so
you'll get to buy their stuff for
cheaper and be it'll force them to be
more competitive so you'll end up
getting you know more power for your
money in the coming so it can link and
other things like that so yeah yeah
you're obviously going to want AMD to
really give them a kick in the backside
because it will also help you if you're
an Intel sample what's the think okay so
we're gonna move on now to the 1080 TI
its planned for midnight so we talked
about this before mid-march apparently
now so it's coming out even soon to now
I've seen GTX a 1080 s going on sale in
Australia for around about 770 strain
dolls which is actually pretty cheap
it's coming under 600 us so maybe
they're gearing up like this release of
the 1080i is going to be pretty soon I
think it is going to be pretty soon but
as we discussed last week I just I don't
see myself wanting one of these at all
because it's just way too late in the
cycle tenis already been out for it
feels like its next year's card almost
sort of yeah I think it's going to come
into a spot it's at the bottom of that
article has you know they say to be
acknowledged with everything but let's
be real we already know what this is
going to be it said cut down time XP
it'll have probably the same memory 12
gigs gddr5 x I go to mention I mean I
don't know yeah I mean I've made a
prediction digs I made a prediction that
it wouldn't have 5x but as times gone on
I mean sheesh they've had so much time
now to source 5x we had a good edge I
would imagine I have 5x now because just
the times so much times gone by it's
like this year yeah I would imagine it
would so um there's that and I would say
I could of course ways the time XP has
3584 cuda cores I would imagine the
1080i will have 3200 something or 3300
something it's basically going to be I
would imagine they'd have a 250 watt TDP
I'll be you know I you know them really
sure about that and it would come in
with a low price tag so I think it'll
just be a GPU there that'll just be a
cheap of
version of the tiny XP it will come in
probably about thirty percent lower in
price and or twenty-five percent lower
in price and it will maybe be like one
or two frames slower or something like
that so maybe let you know a few
percentage points lower and that's all
it's really going to be it's just going
to target that very high-end enthusiast
market people that might have been
saving up all ready to buy a time XP and
they've just decided I well I may as
well just get the 10 ADT I because it's
just a cheaper version the same thing
and of course the time XP sales of just
you know go down to pretty much zero
once at natt I come out this is very
late yeah it is very late i'm more
excited for the 10th 6 t.t I like when I
saw these rumors on okay 1060 t8 could
be real it could be launched besides the
1080 TI this seems real legit I mean
there is that price market certainly
there for it I mean you've got two
hundred and eighty dollars possibly i'd
say that's where it's going to hit
because you can get GTX 10 70s for
around 370 380 I'd say 290 would be
looking because it's right in between
1060 1070 prices 1060 TI for a round
about that yet 290 i'm guessing three
hundred dollar price tag that'd be legit
what do you think the specs will be do
you think it'll be a cut-down 1070 or a
instead of 60 I mean that's what I think
right well I mean it can't be that the
10 6 because the 1060 already runs the
full power GA 106 GPU it has to be the
GP 104 which means that it will just be
a further gave the 1080 which is GP 104
then you got the 1070 which is a cut
down version and then the 10 6 t.t I
would just be a further cut down version
of that same GP 104 GPU so now you just
reckon they'll cut it down to like a few
more critical than a 1060 yeah they'll
trim it down more they'll take probably
some of the memory off and a few things
like that then you get they were just
off assoc it's got one more cluster
enabled oh my god I gotta get a laptop
now I remember that Ted was it the 10 7
he's got like another cluster enabled
and I was just like it's still a laptop
who gives a
yes so I think I love money wise guys I
love my desktop's guys I love my desktop
side you know I of course I respect yeah
laptops out their place but I love my
desktops always will prefer them over
laptops especially when you know you get
these big screens now like have you got
yourself the 34 inch ultra wide yet have
you taken the plan I'm not the hugest
fan of alts right there i prefer um I
prefer that do you know I'm sorta I
stick to I'm just running a 28 inch 4k
display but um now I've tried through a
tough test at how many 43 ultraoids now
and yet they're definitely nice I just
can't in all the reviews i did i just
said i just cannot justify these
enormous costs that they have you seen
the sami or have you seen CF 791 no you
haven't seen a wall okay here's a true
story by friend he's uh he's mom went
out and bought one what yeah that's it
like mom like freaking 34 inch ultra
wide brush she's got all the specs now
she's rocking it calm and Mike that is
just gonna look so good in that that's
it Perla that's it so I mean this
monitor is no joke people come around
the place you can see it they're like
holy I want one of these so I might
have a seat man go take the whole thing
for a tour you know Grand Tour do it
yeah uh yeah it makes me look lazy sad
because it makes me look like a corny
Samsung salesman but no this monitor is
legit I I'd love it absolutely love it I
haven't had a monitor this good it's
like a revolution for me in ways it's
almost like a risin for monitors for me
so because it's because of those cutie
LEDs brothers photoluminescence stuff
that's what they don't know so
anyway yeah so sits mcc TI portably
rumored to come out alongside the 1080
TI that's what we go we would no more to
in two days time there's going to be
it's quite funny they're having them on
the exact same day AMD and NVIDIA having
press releases on big events on the same
day and in video we'll be talking about
the 1080 TI and probably the tenth
successfully and their deal be talking
about Vega 10 and Vega 11
which is actually the more interesting
one because we have less idea on what
the Vega GPUs will be than these we have
a pretty good idea if the if the 1080 is
is going to be a Titan cut down tiny XP
and the 1060 tis is going to be a
further cut down GP 104 GPU we all have
a pretty good idea in mind about where
the performance is going to be at
whereas a vega we don't have much idea
at all where the performance you can you
can you see how smart in video are is a
business like damn this smart yeah they
know these cpu is going to be huge what
better waiting to release a graphics
card right on launch day of CPUs that
could be as early as much second I mean
damn yeah if they do it's just gone
crazy all the companies are going crazy
right now it's just like it's just
something about this this industry is
that it would just be like dead silent
for months and it's just crickets and
then all of a sudden they all just
explode out and just release or there's
all this information all this hype and
then it then it goes quiet I mean I'm
sure it's going to be after March well
that's why you've got to keep up with
used Prospero you're going to go into
the used price performance stuff because
it's always crack and there's always a
new cpu coming up a new deal at the
moment it's looking like it's the ex
3470 that's looking like the deal at the
mo 50 bucks four cores eight threads
overclockable man that's the new cpu I
think that's the deal that's the deal
breaker so you can see there's all these
new deals coming up all the time that's
the new deal I love yous price
performance for that reason of course
the new stuff is really good reisen is
going to be huge but look at it look at
in video a that we've know in the past
right they've had some real serious
rivalry going with AMD but as a business
point they just playing it smart they're
like okay our competitors are going to
release the CPU lineup it's going to be
huge let's release a GPU beside it like
I mean it'sit's yeah yeah they plates
nvidia plates smart man that's why they
was a bit i guess that's why they're the
best company on the SP for performance I
mean Jesus Christ there's good yeah
exactly I mean yeah nvidia just doesn't
muck around but don't muck around do
they itch don't muck around sorry to any
Christians out there don't mean to
offend you guys sorry I shouldn't use
that word that's actually for me that's
what
and cursing because I've met some
Christian people they're so lovely man
like every Christian I've come across in
my life absolutely amazing people I saw
this weird no it's weird man you know
crazy anyway so nokia 3310 do you want
to take this away because yeah I it's
just a blast from the past I mean
everyone I saw a hell of a lot of people
talking about this and it's the if you
do not remember or maybe weren't old
enough to remember as maybe some of our
audience are the 3310 was a nokia back
in it would have come out in 2001 I
thought no no would it be a bit later
than that 2000 this was is this the one
that is this the one that was like a
hammer you could double down as a hammer
yeah yes they call it a you know it was
this thing was like a brick it was like
I remember a friend of mine throwing his
3310 at a at a road sign once and it
like hitter and like just fell down the
ground we picked it up and it was fine
and other thing they were just like
unkillable and they've got you know had
this big reputation of being these
unkillable phones my mum actually had
the 33 15 which was essentially the same
thing to sort of like a slightly updated
model yet um but yeah so it seems like
Nokia in there uh well they wanting to
get back into the market they've had
been through some pretty tough times
lately if you're not aware but I I mean
it's when was the last time you heard
nokia have a you know Tommy a real hit
phone because nowadays like I've been
using this highway and I dropped this
from them like the other one in the vlog
I dropped that from a meter the screen
just cracked and you know the worst
thing about it was I thought it would
just be a quick take off the glass put
another one on Dunc jobs done no had to
remove all the hardware out the back and
then I found out ordered the wrong part
anyway so no I say yes so it's basically
this new one it's not a carbon copy of
the old one obviously that would be it
would be you know that would be funny
but it's it's a
more modernized version so it's going to
have a little you know the old run only
had a black and white screen officers on
I have a color screen the reckoning is
going to have a 22 hour battery which is
pretty awesome and you're going to be
able to play snake on it which a lot of
people like it's always like so maybe
empty boxes over the same 50 buck fifty
bucks yeah it has a 2 megapixel rear
camera and yeah i think i don't know i
think a lot of people will end up buying
this just for nostalgia reasons but i
don't know how well it'll actually do
but good on nokia you know i guess they
figured well well we haven't had a head
in a whirlwind doctors bring out our you
know our biggest tip phone i think we've
ever released are you going to buy one
of these and just make a video on it how
tough is the 3310 i think that would be
a great video i want to see it on your
channel then well I just just by want to
show you there will be like 300 videos
from all the smartphone and tablet guys
that do all those types of the I'm sure
they will make videos yeah we're getting
sick we've got to take it up a step then
but I like by like 10 of them and then
use them as ninja stars and then make
like skit that thinks they're things
dangerous man you through that it's on
it's like well that's it like just yeah
just ninja stars 3310 like you got to
take it up a level why should people
watch your review because you're using
him like a samurai right yeah it would
be it would be pretty funny I think I
think that they'll probably this would
be a hit with the with the oldies as
well or kids that are looking to buy a
phone for parents or grandparents
something like that I think this would
be a nice simple one to give them very
solid and durable and reliable as you
would expect from Nokia so yeah good
good on nokia getting back in there in
back in the public eye and you know more
on them guys more on the phone news so
we got more phone news here we'll just
get through the phone use and we get on
to the Q&amp;amp;A but we got here the 10
nanometer yeah from samsung yes this is
Samsung's first 10 nanometer octa-core I
forgot he pronounces i knows deal sounds
better I'd say goes there we go sanus 9
chip I'll just go with a little bit of a
different twist all goes in us
your ex eNOS hi suppose maybe I don't
know any race regardless is this their
first 10 nanometer so it's good to see
Samsung gettin down at ten Samsung have
been doing quite good in there as well
cpu market they mean they've been doing
it got a good job CEO don't know if this
will go on the new galaxy s 8 it may or
may not but they're saying going down to
the 10 nanometer FinFET process delivers
twenty-seven percent high performance
while consuming forty percent less power
when compared to earlier 14 nanometer
technology so that's really good
obviously what you'd like to see and
yeah this this should be really solid I
think that the performances is a good
thing obviously but I think more people
are interested in the power efficiency
when it comes to smartphones I mean
we're all wanting that really good
battery life to be honest man like I'm
not like I don't like for me as long as
the phone can take pictures call
Instagram Twitter and Facebook or
whatever like I'm not too concerned with
it so I mean yeah it'sit's more for me
it's like a meth thing I I mean it's
good in the sense there's a lot of power
users out there are there at 16 is up
I'm not even a power user so I
understand what you're meaning i barely
all i do use my phone for is um you know
a handful of things but i'm saying for
the power users out that people that
will kill a phone in a day every single
day they're just oh yeah for the guys
all day long trade ya the guise of Wall
Street got like you know that's
different chance on body this in less
power yeah they got like live life
monitoring or the stock markets all on
their phone yeah alert this alert that
bang bang bang hell they might even have
red alert playing at the same time you
need us haha some of these guys roll you
know so and yet apparently they're
getting ready to launch the galaxy s 8
as well on april twenty first yes so
this will be interesting looks really
like we just have a proto joke a display
like that's the prototype shops are the
photo i'm not i'm not one hundred
percent sure about what looks nice the
expected specs as a 4k display so that's
kind of crazy processor this thing is
going to be the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820
one
but i believe they might try put in that
new 10 animator and cpu in their 20
megapixel rear camera expected obviously
android seven point 0 and six gigs of
ram four thousand million power battery
that's no joke either that's pretty damn
big and a phone the standard we see for
a phone with that screen size would be
something like between 3,000 and three
and a half thousand so jumping a 4,000
but of course guys wait a little while
and of course it'll be 16 hundred and
seventy bucks crazy yeah i mean it is
expensive and this is supposed to be a
high-end phone but I maybe maybe leave
it for a month after its come out to see
if anyone's having bet battery promise
you I want to get one of these and have
another sort of explosion type issue
yeah way that was with a note lineup but
you know you don't want to take the risk
I think a lot of people will be waiting
here to see the results here but that's
I expect that to be a very high in
finder yeah yeah we're going to move
over to QA and we got a lot of questions
in this week so if you guys have
questions head over the forearms tech
city TV / forums I'll be making a new
thread for next week's questions so if
you guys can't make the stream and you
want your questions answered drop in
here and i'll try and answer them for
you and we got here the first arm
everyone's always talking this is a good
question from a souris 99 everyone's
always talking about overclocking in the
max speeds however like a car if you red
line the thing too much will it have a
detrimental effect to the health of the
said engine or said cpu and now with the
7700 it's a lot different right i mean
if you're talking about redlining a
engine right you're talking about taking
it to the absolute max that's ready to
go out if we're if we're taking a 700 k
especially on air and water we're not
taking it near its max like those guys
on ln2 they're essentially doing the red
lining you know i mean they're the guys
who are doing all the work like what
you're doing with an air and water
overclocked is you're basically finding
that sweet spot level that level where
diminishing returns really start to kick
in and for instance my cpu it'll go up
to 5.1 gigahertz this is the one that i
recently looked at but i'll only do that
for benchmarking if i was running that
thing 24
7 it'd be at five or even four point
nine I definitely drop it down to 5 100
megahertz law and you can get that 100
megahertz it'll cost you like 50
millivolts so it's not worth it for the
power extra power consumption and the
extra strain on the CPU so for a lot of
people overclocking I recommend finding
that max overclock dropping it a hundred
megahertz and you'll be able to you know
the long-term effects will be a lot
better but yeah if you do run your cpu
for instance if i get my 7700 k find a
way to max it out go whatever 1.48 volt
5.2 gigahertz all day every day it's
going to be crazy because the CPUs not
only got the extra heat there it's
working harder and then it's got the
extra voltage to handle its yet it is a
one big cycle that just gets worse and
worse and worse so you do want to find
that sweet spot and that's what they
call it in overclocking the sweet spot
you want to find it for your CPU and
just sit there and you should have a
healthy life with the cpu for years to
come yeah i think if you if you're
really taking to the max here you will
see but I mean CPUs last a long time for
my spot so you know you will I don't
think there's any denying that it may
not last as long but I mean it depends
how long you're actually going to owner
you're going to keep the cpu for like
five years or are you going to keep it
for two years and then get rid of it i
mean it's you know really you know it's
not going to make that much difference
if you overclock it really hard and then
you sell it in one year's time i mean it
would be very surprised if it broke come
in that way at time hey guys it's gone
give from tick showdown i'm going to
answer the QA like this man what's
happening okay let's get thee let's get
on to the next question you just gently
man cuz you can't pull up the beard as
well as as well as a kiwi you know you
know Oh Sees you know that just can't
grow the beards properly it just comes
out yeah there you go alright guys we're
going to answer the next question here
Zach's tech turf he says he's a huge fan
of the channel he's been watched 30
videos thanks man he's been inspired to
create custom pcs okay cool put your
link in the description if
you want and oh he's gone from he wants
to make a video from dumpsters to play
in crisis now I think his with here he
wants to know how he can get extra
performance without spending a whole lot
of extra money on the build so basically
the specs are he's got an x2 4800 dual
core that would be where you would want
to switch things up a little if you
could run an extra 4 gigabytes of RAM if
it's possible but you definitely want to
put in a better cpu there to get those
higher frames because the GTX 1050 I
it's a very capable card especially
compared to the athlon 64 x2 so that
would be my tip to get some more out of
that of course yeah the better the CPU
generally the more expensive it is so
you'd have to look around for a deal but
yeah yeah I'd agree with that one
hundred percent that's definitely the
the probably place where you'll see the
biggest gains given what the information
you've given us that's that seems to be
the weakest link is sort of too harsh
return but you know what i mean that
that would be the area that's lacking
the most is this yep you to definitely a
switch that out if you can to something
even just you know a little bit more
expensive and you should see quite a
decent game all right sue Gaudio Joey
says the next question his arm he's
turned most of these 3d settings in the
nvidia control panel such as anti
aliasing anisotropic filtering all fall
down I imagine to get a better frame
rate with his 1060 in csgo now he's
apparently is losing frames after he's
done this so one thing with a 1060
should be absolute csgo man you can get
up to like 500 frames per second at
1080p with the turn 60 is that the 10 CS
is not the problem it would be and
messing with settings in the nvidia
control panel for the game like CS you
should be changing the settings in csgo
itself so you might be having conflicts
there I would just honestly I just
probably just reinstall your drivers and
then go back into CS go change the
settings in CS go and find what settings
they work keep in mind fallout 4 if you
want to break the 60 FPS vsync cap
then you will want to go into the nvidia
control panel and disable vsync manually
that's about all I do and of course the
pre-rendered frame setting put that to
one and yeah you should be cool after
that so yeah what's up now that I would
agree with that I just it's quite um
yeah just what you know was 300 frames
on ultra before not high enough in csgo
yeah it's like yeah yeah you like this
document you like this beard don't you
you like it yep yeah man you really you
look um you know your gray hair cuz what
do you like 45 now that's it fine the
grind yes Brian yes showdown City bruh
yep pushing you know mid 40s man you
know camera baby you know it's all right
I'm not gonna judge here it's all right
bright we will we will have a you know
Joanna do you already go into the
kitchen and get your salt shaker I did
so so we got asked about what do you
think buying windows 10 from the
websites kinguin yeah yeah i bought a
key from there before Levin legit so it
depends with anything out her I have
heard of people getting hosed on kinguin
so your mileage may vary how about you
care what's your experience with kinguin
I've never used at that website before
so i can't i can't really have an
opinion on it but i'm just having a look
at it now it looks looks fine so yeah
i'm sure i mean if you say it's been
fine for you then it then yeah I think
it'll be all right you have to be
careful with some of these keys i see
that says OEM key yeah something guys
out there be aware of that that is
slightly different to some of the other
ones if you're building a brand new
system then you don't matter for you
that so waiver d he says he's got a
spare gtx 660m SI and the voltage is
locked so it's not up for much in terms
of overclocking so here's where he
struggles is it better to pair it up
with hardware from circa 2012 or can he
push the boat out a bit and try it with
something you are I guess it's a general
question of pairing up hardware old
versus new when gtx 660 you can of
course pair it up with hardware from
2009 like even a GGG XO gtx 660 that'll
be fine with something like this x 54 60
that's an old LGA 775 cpu generally the
the GPUs are lagging behind the CPUs
especially since we haven't been getting
many CPU updates so yeah generally like
you could even pair I'm going to try it
like I'll get eternity and I'll pair it
with the ex 56-60 overclocked and then
i'll compare of us at 7700 k i really
want to see that test just to see how
far how far cpus haven't come in the
last year a few years so yeah so I'd say
yeah definitely pair it up with old
hardware especially a 660 so there's no
worry they're here yeah there any has
walls eons that we should look into the
into the far future apparently the
Haswell Zeon's can be maxed on the turbo
on the single or dual core multiplier so
you can get a next 99 board for cheap
you put a custom bios on it and you
should be able to get your 12 core and
14 core xeons too ridiculously good
speeds so yeah and then check one he
stole the limelight thanks man and then
we got coalition gaming any chance
you'll be fooling around with any EGP
you setups do it yourself or otherwise
so the how about you keV do you know
there's external GPU setups I up for me
I kind of I don't want to bother like
for me it's kind of like a bit
bothersome again that whole laptop
they're generally for laptops I'd rather
just feel like desktop setup yeah I
tested that in the past with the or what
laptop one of the MSI ones i tested
before and they had the GPU dot so you
could plug the laptop and it actually
worked really nicely
so I was actually quite surprised by it
yeah I mean obviously it wouldn't really
be for me but I can understand their
appeal for sure especially in the laptop
market although it sort of does sort of
makes you big the question these days
with how good the laptop GPUs themselves
are you know the 1070 base laptops are
very good in terms of performance makes
you wonder sort of what's the point um
yeah I don't I don't really see it
becoming a big thing personally I just I
think there's a hassle as well right
you'd off your laptop in your dock your
laptop and then you got this big box on
your desk you got to plug it all up
mother yeah just a powerful laptop so
wherever you go wherever you're using it
has the 1070 already in it nice and
powerful and you can go and you know
play all your games know that wii UI you
don't have to have the dock with you
well the thing is you've got you USB it
runs via USB 3 and 3.1 yeah I usually
run yeah 3.1 or it depends they will
seem to try different things they
usually go into the laptop then it'll
the laptop ones will dock with sometimes
sort of it I can't remember back to the
MSI one I believe it it was like a PCI
type adapter in the back of it um well
the thing is rather thing is if I'm
having problems getting you know 1080p
gameplay footage out of my capture card
over USB 3 what do you think is going to
happen with a whole GPU I just for me
like the problems that just they far
outweigh the actual worth of digital
decent GPU and your laptop from the
get-go anyway so yeah I think a lot of
ones people use with the non laptops use
thunderbolt which I would which makes
probably the most sense to use
Thunderbolt these days but yeah I again
I reiterate I don't think it's a going
to be something that captures on maybe
I'll be wrong but I I don't really see
it happen yeah and I'm didn't getting
unto it so icebergs actually asked a
really good question he's like as a
young YouTube creator he
all about the budget hardware he loves
you know fixing the broken stuff getting
they used stuff in and he asked them a
really good question he usually finds
that he's getting all these build pc
build videos with all the broken parts
and what not in use parts fixed together
they get a lot more views than the
normal videos and he asked why don't why
don't me as well why not just keep
building use pcs why don't why why are
my videos on cases or keyboards and
stuff like that why i just go all out
and just every video is a budget build
and the thing is man last year I was
actually doing that guy like all my
videos every week was just like a budget
build and people were getting sick of it
see I just like to give my audience
variety especially now like I want to do
like a monthly vlog we're doing the tech
lounge every week and you know of course
the builds are going to get the most
views but you've always got your core
audience there who just love what you do
and they support you and they just want
to see everything you don't want to keep
just giving them okay here's a PC let's
build it you want to give them a bit of
variety that's just how I think of it so
yeah you're giving them variety and
that's the best way to do it right and
of course you know the companies are
sending in products and whatnot they're
review samples I get to keep the review
sample it's helping me out yeah and so
you know it helps everyone I guess to
give a bit of variety review a different
you know product and then do a budget
build mix it up a little bit it's you
know you can you can speak for this cave
like you know you're doing well the same
style all the time you're going to get
it you want to change it up a bit yeah
that's what I did at the start was
that's how I got the name for the
channel tick showdown as well as doing
what's basically GPU showdowns and
people get yeah people do get tired of
it they like to see a variety of content
you should always basically every
channel will have that one thing that
their audience does really like I think
my channel it is the GPU videos and with
Bryan's channel it is these amused pop
builds that's sort of like the
cornerstone of your channel sort of the
the that's where a lot of you guys
playing for
you know back to every so soft and but
you have to have the variety in between
as well because if that's all you're
doing the audience does get tired of it
and I think it kind of makes it less
special as well so it's good to do the
other things and build those up as well
and sort of that's why i started doing
all the peripherals and stuff as well
and started doing the laptops and then a
lot of people really liked my laptop
review so that's why I've kept on doing
them quite often as well so that that
was something but but yeah you have to
have a balance and it's fun as I mean
it's for us as the creators to if we're
doing the same type of thing over and
over it is still fun i love testing GPUs
but you like to test out other things as
well it's nice to test out a new laptop
or a new pair of headphones or a new
gaming keyboard or something in between
doing all that other stuff at the same
time just you know spices it up a little
bit yeah well that's that mean so yeah
we got another question here dirt boy
asks a question for kev if you and Brian
were to play scrapyard was what type of
pc would you build and what can you find
a new cell for cheap I think like don't
you go it's a question for you so you go
first oh ok yet what new zealand's just
everything's expensive so and I don't
really keep an eye on the use pc part
market i keep I a double every so often
but yeah I would say in New Zealand's um
GPU wise for sure to 90s and 290 X's you
can get them for very cheap now on sites
like trade me and 280 X's which is the
same as it's a 7970 gigahertz edition so
if you could find that you know more
power to you they also go for quite
cheap see and pick up you know I'm
seeing 22 9290 X's you can get in for
like two hundred two hundred fifty
dollars New Zealand then to 80's you
probably pick one up for like 150 or
someone gave you lucky so there's that
if I was going to do it it would be
based around one of those 3gp use either
to ATX or 290 or 290x and then I would
just find some cpu maybe maybe go back
to Sandy Bridge and try find it and I
2500 k or something I can pick up for
cheap and or 2600 k and don't go crazy
with that but I think it would be you
know people people ask questions like
that but if we have me and Brian
whatever do an actual scrap yard was it
would just wear would have what we would
pick would be what would be available
you can say well in my dream world I'd
pick this cpu that cheap you but if
we're going to do it and we only give
ourselves a few days sexually get all
the parts and build their system yeah
all there's none of those things on the
market then we're not going to be
abdullah mar always also it's going to
say is if we did this if we did this I'd
fly over to where you're at and would do
it where you're at I don't care like any
other person in the world as long as
they're not going to drop me in the
middle of the ghetto I'll come over to
where you're at and we'll do scrapyard
Wars you not I mean I for me it'd be so
much fun it be a new experience you know
so whatever wherever i'm down brothers i
love a good challenge so yeah if we were
to do this i'd go over to new zealand
and would go on the road get a get a car
and put some sheep decals on it oh yeah
man you can put it like you know your
kangaroo decals on it bounced around and
you know you can bounce out a new
zealand while you're at it um i do it we
got it we got to get out of it we gotta
get through this eve questions here so
yeah we're going to ask about the
comparisons yeah we're going to be doing
comparisons of course our seven cpu
versus cavy league so we're going to be
testing that someone got a banged up h
81 m and he says what's a good c for you
to go with it it depends on your budget
the dual-core the g 3258 will be really
cheap of course you've got the 12 31 v 3
which is a really good see on that's for
corey thread so there's a few different
options there so and oh yeah wait until
after aizen of course so yeah so it's
someone asks the last question here
we've got is over 1700 versus the 1700 x
in the 1800 x what's the difference
one's got a lower TDP right ones got the
1700 has 65 watts
so what's the difference really yeah the
1800 x is the highest clocked out of the
box whether it's the highest Bend we
still have to find that out but again
it's for people who just don't care
about overclocking or even people who
care about overclocking and want the
best bin so that's why they're paying
the extra money for me I looking I'm
looking at the r7 1700 and love and what
I'm seeing that's going to be the value
pick how will it our clocks on average
will make some threads anyway once this
is released and we'll get some you know
get some feedback from everyone in the
thread about how well different SKUs
overclock with legit results for you so
anyway guys yeah I've been a big show
this week thanks for tuning in if you
guys have questions head over to taxi
DTV / forums I'll make a new thread for
that we can ask questions in there and
we'll answer them next week and sorry
we're in a bit late I had to get this
new setup ultra-wide set up cracking
hope you guys enjoy it I got the ultra
wide news coming to you and I'll put
Cavs channel I'll put that in the link
link in description below thanks for
tuning in you guys are awesome and I'll
take this beard off and anything to say
before we go keV oh yeah if you guys
want to ice or a few people asking our
we can you find my channel just type in
text showdown and youtube or in google
you you'll see my silly smile come up
and you can harm check out my channel i
will be doing a lot of rising content
very soon obviously we're still under
NDA so how much we can do right now but
yeah i promised you guys that that is in
the process right now and it will be
hopefully i'll be doing 1800 x and 1700
x videos might do a showdown comparing
the two of them to each other what Brian
was just saying you know try to do some
overclocking and really see if that 1800
X's may be worth it over the 1700 x in
terms of paying that extra money for it
alright guys I'll be doing stuff like
that first we got to get going so love
y'all thanks for tuning in and we'll
catch you guys next week on another
awesome episode of the tech lounge look
forward to a guy's peace out for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
