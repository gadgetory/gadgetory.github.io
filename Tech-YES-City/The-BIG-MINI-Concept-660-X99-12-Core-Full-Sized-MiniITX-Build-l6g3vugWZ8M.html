when I did a build in the past I came
into a very interesting case from a
company called windy and I wanted to do
something special with it and something
special I have done with it
welcome back to tech yes City this is
brian coming to you guys today with a
different kind of bill this time around
I've got a case that's kind of like the
size of a mini ITX case yet we've got a
full sized x99 motherboard in there a
12-course cpu and also a gtx 750ti
though how is all this going to perform
in games and benchmarks well let's get
on with our usual order of doing the
prices of these parts then we'll get on
with the build and then we'll get on
with the benchmarks
I know the town does nothing still can
see the world when it spinning
compensating for the wish I could fly
like an airplane stop in everything that
I've got won't be breaking easily now
like you
righto kill me down you don't know who
wouldn't
stop shaking
then
go
so watch me
so watch me
can you be my nigga
I am
you
thank you
Oh
can you be so
Oh
so there it is the benchmarks are in and
this thing was surprisingly doing very
well at 1080p
especially for a 750ti it was playing
the latest doom title at 1080p on decent
settings with no problems at all scoring
over 50 fps their Dark Souls 3 was still
doing really well getting over 40 FPS
average there and project cars was
actually kicking ass
even though despite the settings were
decent as well so 1080p was no problems
at all for gaming though you guys are
probably thinking I could have coupled
this build with a much better graphics
card and yes that Xeon 12-core is
capable of handling even a 980ti and
I've tested this in the past
great CPU for the money especially for
$200 this thing was going really well
Center benchmarks there over 1500 points
and those past mark scores were scoring
better in a lot of the tests than a
5820k though when it comes to coupling
with the graphics card in this
particular build I had to go with the
low powered GPU since the airflow was
very limited in this case all pun
intended you probably hear that pun joke
all the time in this case in this case
though besides the most overly used pun
joke in the tech scene this case was
very limited in airflow and with that I
had to only pretty much put in low power
consumption parts so the 12 core Xeon
even though it's a 12 core it doesn't
use that much power at all in the max
temperatures even in a 28 degree ambient
environment while playing games was only
clocking in at around about 50 degrees
which was really damn good also the GPU
managed to go hit around about 74
degrees and so this is kind of like a
worst case scenario in that if you've
got the aircon on the temperatures will
be much lower so I was very happy with
the temps though if I did couple in that
bigger graphics card then I'm sure the
temperatures would have started to gone
sky high so what does all this mean
essentially well I really wanted to
demonstrate a concept here today and
that I could get that smoke spray paint
make a different build but also make
that full-sized mini ITX sized case a
reality and I would like to see
companies do something like this now
like I think I could have got some fans
in the front and really made a kick-ass
build with a full sized x99 board I
think that's something that a lot of us
tech enthusiasts would like to see in
the future because I can definitely use
this for travel
and I may even take this thing to the
States I'll sing it about getting a
laptop when I was traveling for PAX
Prime but I might take this thing
instead because it actually is very
small and it isn't that heavy at all
so very impressed with the build quality
of this case and also the functionality
and utility of it so for 1080p video
editing I think I'm going to have
absolutely no problems at all
with this mini ITX size full-size PC
case so there it is the bill was a
little bit expensive and it was a little
bit awkward but I think it was a big
success so if you guys liked this build
be sure to drop a comma in the comment
section below and hit that like button
and I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye
oh all the bad times I'm going through
just dance balloons a little I got
myself a mini mini mini and another one
down and another one down and another
one bass adjust Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
