called will csgo bf4 for life
fuck God and all that other BS bf4 is
keeping it real with 10 FPS 10 FPS
welcome back to tech yes it is Barack
I'm about you yesterday with some
battlefield 4 gameplay footage and now
the topic today is going to be directly
related to battlefield 4 and also the
next installment of the Battlefield
franchise which is battlefield hardline
now I won't be purchasing battlefield
hardline or nor will I be pre-ordering
it because of the fact that they're not
giving us a new engine they're pretty
much copy pasted in the same engine from
the Battlefield series and the an
inherent floor of this engine is that
there's a 10 Hertz tick rate and
essentially what this means is basically
a server update rate of ten times a
second so every 100 milliseconds your
computer will send data to the server
and then it'll send data back and it'll
update the game like that and so
basically what this means is is you will
generally have to wait a hundred
milliseconds before you can register
bullets on a target and so what this
means is in competitive play
you'll be over shooting targets
sometimes you might be you'll be missing
them if they're running too fast or if
they're in a vehicle going too fast
and now though a few people will say but
they've updated it to 30 Hertz but
that's only on one side and that doesn't
solve the issue the server is still
updating the game ten times a second
which for a game in 2015 I believe this
is inadequate I think they need to
update it to at least at least 30 Hertz
for an FPS I mean if we look at a MOBA
game like heroes a new earth that's got
an update rate of 20 Hertz I mean with a
good Cod that's got 30 Hertz we look at
csgo that's got 64 Hertz or 128 Hertz so
you can see that battlefield 4 is
certainly behind other competitive FPS
shooters when you weigh up when you look
at the server update rate and so what
does this mean essentially what is this
server update rate Brian Brian you're
probably wondering well I'll put some
links in the description below that go
further in depth as to exactly what it
is but essentially it's a big floor in
battlefield 4 in sum one reason that
stops me from playing this game a lot
because I actually like the graphics I
like the actual feel of some of the gun
I like the big expensive world or the
size of the maps but I just find myself
not being satisfied when I'm playing
this game especially team deathmatch it
just feels like something's off and ever
since I started playing Battlefield it's
always felt like something's been off
with this game and then I started
researching and I found out this is
exactly what was happening there's only
a 10 Hertz server update rate
implemented or hard-coded into this game
so that's the biggest issue and the
problem is as I said the start of a this
is actually going to be the same deal
with the next installment of the game
battlefield hardline so they're still
gonna have this floor EA not fixing this
and so I'm not gonna give them my money
you know especially to get its 2015 like
come on get on your game like oh pun
intended you know get on your game and
fix this because we shouldn't be paying
top dollar like this is apparently a
triple-a title and we shouldn't be
paying top dollar for a triple-a title
to have such a crap update rate and
there are some other things that I don't
like about this game though they are
subjective and you know subjective
things that is for another day and
obviously what some things that I don't
like some other people might like and
vice-versa so we're not going to talk
about that in today's video but just
keep in mind that today's that the
problem I'm identifying today is the
biggest problem that I think all people
have with this game and I think EA need
to quickly update this especially for PC
users there's no reason why this should
be happening on PC I mean we're not on
dial-up anymore there's no more dial-up
internet well I don't know anyone who
uses dial-up internet anymore I mean
fair enough people with ps4s and Xbox
ones with crap internet ok I can
understand but you know you're making
two different versions of the game
you're making one version for the PC one
version for the console give the console
users 10 Hertz
update rate I don't care but don't give
here's the enthusiasts 10 Hertz update
rate or at least give us the option to
view with servers at least give us the
choice to jump on servers that have a
higher update rate and an encourage
service to use a higher update rate but
I don't think again I think this is a
problem that's baked into the actual
code of the game and how its coded and
so they have to actually change the game
itself in order to get a higher up a
true higher update rate so this is the
biggest problem this is as I said before
it's the reason why I'm not gonna be
purchasing battlefield hardline and it's
pretty sad because a lot of my friends
on they ask me why don't you play
battlefield for men why I'll never see
you on battlefield 4 and I'll show you a
screenshot I mean I've only got like
seven hours total played time on this
game and I think like four of that four
hours of that is just me benchmarking
the game like not even playing it so
I've played this game for a total of
three hours
I haven't even played it that much I
just don't enjoy it and the biggest
reason I don't enjoy is cuz I find
myself feeling like I've been screwed
when I'm trying to hit a target or when
I thought I hit a target overshooting
targets especially overshooting targets
it just feels like it's it's feel
sluggish the game feels sluggish and I
think the update rate is dude that big
part of that I think maybe the engine's
outdated too at the core and so I mean
obviously a 10 Hertz update rate would
indicate that the game engine itself is
sluggish as well since they're basing it
on an old engine so all in all there's
not much that I can say that's positive
about this 10 Hertz update rate and I'm
sure there's a lot of hardcore
battlefield users who already know about
this problem but I will say one thing in
the short time that I've already played
this game there's already been two
instances that's right - like in
probably like three hours of playing
this game I've had two instances where
I've killed someone and they've killed
me at the same time with just guns
and now if anyone plays csgo or plays
Cod they'll know how extreme it's I
haven't even seen it in cs:go before I
think I've seen it in cod once out of
the hundreds of hours that I've played
it so it's extremely rare to get a
simultaneous gun kill in other FPS games
but already in three hours of playing
the game I've already had to happen
twice in this game so that's definitely
speaks for itself
and how big of a problem this is with
battlefield 4 but anyway guys I hope you
enjoyed this gameplay commentary and if
you have any questions or comments then
drop them in the comment section below
but as it stands yeah I'm not going to
be buying battlefield hardlines so don't
even bother asking me because EA is not
getting my money this time around anyway
guys hope you enjoyed this video and if
you did please give it a thumbs up and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon and peace out for now wait</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
