comp will csgo bf4 for life fuck God and
all that other BS bf4 is keeping it real
with 10 FPS 10 FPS
welcome back to tech yes it is Barack
I'm about you guys today with some
battlefield 4 gameplay footage and now
the topic today is going to be directly
related to battlefield 4 and also the
next installment of the Battlefield
franchise which is battlefield hardline
now I won't be purchasing battlefield
hardline or nor will I be pre-ordering
it because of the fact that they're not
giving us a new engine they're pretty
much copied pasted in the same engine
from the battlefield series and the an
inherent floor of this engine is that
there's a 10 Hertz tick rate and
essentially what this means is basically
a server update rate of 10 times a
second so every 100 milliseconds your
computer will send data to the server
and then I'll send data back and it'll
update the game like that and so
basically what this means is is you will
generally have to wait a hundred
milliseconds before you can register
bullets on the target and so what this
means is in competitive play you'll be
over shooting targets sometimes you
won't beat you'll be missing them if
they're running too fast or if they're
in a vehicle going too fast and now
though a few people will say but they've
updated it to 30 Hertz but that's only
on one side and that doesn't solve the
issue the server is still updating the
game 10 times a second which for a game
in 2015 I believe this is inadequate I
think they need to update it to at least
at least 30 Hertz for an FPS I mean if
we look at a MOBA game like heroes of
newerth that's got an update rate of 20
Hertz I mean with look at cod that's got
30 Hertz we look at csgo that's got
sixty four Hertz or 128 hurts so you can
see that battlefield 4 is certainly
behind other competitive FPS shooters
when you weigh up when you look at the
server update rate and so what does this
mean essentially like what is this
server update rate bro Brian you're
probably wondering well I'll put some
links in the description below that go
further in depth as to exactly what it
is but essentially it's a big flaw in
battlefield 4 in some one reason that
stops me from playing this game a lot
because I actually like the graphics I
like the actual feel of some of the guns
I like the big expansive world or the
size of the maps but I just find myself
not being satisfied when I'm playing
this game especially team deathmatch it
just feels like something's off and ever
since I started playing battlefield it's
always felt like something's been off
with this game and then I started
researching and I found out this is
exactly what was happening there's only
a 10 Hertz server update rate
implemented or hard-coded into this game
so that's the biggest issue and the
problem is as I said the star via this
is actually going to be the same deal
with the next installment of the game
battlefield hardline so they're still
going to have this floor EA not fixing
this and so I'm not going to give them a
money you know especially to delegate
it's 2015 like come on get on your game
like all pun intended you know get on
your game and fix this because we
shouldn't be paying top-dollar like this
is apparently a triple a title we
shouldn't be paying top dollar for a
triple a title to have such a crap
update rate and there are some other
things that I don't like about this game
though they are subjective and you know
subjective things that is for another
day and obviously what some things that
I don't like some other people might
like and vice versa so we're not going
to talk about that in today's video but
just keep in mind that today's that the
problem I'm identifying today is the
biggest problem that I think all people
have with this game and I think EA need
to quickly update this especially for PC
users there's no reason why this should
be happening on PC I mean we're not on
dial-up anymore there's no more dial-up
internet well I don't know anyone who
uses dial-up internet anymore I mean
fair enough people with ps4 S and Xbox
ones with crap internet okay i can
understand but you know you're making
two different versions of the game you
making one version for the pc one
version for the console give the console
uses 10 hertz update rate i don't care
but don't give easy enthusiasts 10 hertz
update rate or at least give us the
option to view with servers at least
give us the choice to jump on servers
that have a higher update rate and
encourage service to use a higher update
rate but I don't think again I think
this is a problem that's baked into the
actual code of the game and how it's
coded and so they have to actually
change the game itself in order to get a
higher up a true higher update rate so
this is the biggest problem this is as I
said before it's the reason why I'm not
going to be purchasing battlefield
hardline and it's pretty sad because a
lot of my friends on they asked me why
don't you play battlefield 4 men well
I'll never see you on battlefield 4 and
I'll show you a screenshot I mean I've
only got like seven hours total played
time on this game and I think like four
of that four hours of that is just me
benchmarking the game like not even
playing it so I've played this game for
a total of three hours I haven't even
played it that much I just don't enjoy
it and the biggest reason I don't enjoy
is because I find myself feeling like
I've been screwed when I'm trying to hit
a target or when I thought I hit a
target over shooting targets especially
over shooting targets it just feels like
it's feel sluggish the game feels
sluggish and I think the update rate is
dude but big part of that I think maybe
the engines outdated to at the core and
so I mean obviously a 10 Hertz update
rate would indicate that the game engine
itself is sluggish as well since they're
basing it on an old engine soul and all
there's not much that I can say that's
positive about this 10 Hertz update rate
and I'm sure there's a lot of hardcore
battlefield users who already know about
this problem but I will say one thing in
the short time that I've already played
this game there's already been two
instances that's right to like in
probably like three hours of playing
this game I've had two instances where
I've killed someone and they've killed
me at the same time with just guns and
now if anyone plays csgo or plays cod
they'll know how extreme it's I haven't
even seen it in CS go before I think
I've seen it in cod once out of the
hundreds of hours that I've played it so
it's extremely rare to get a
simultaneous gun kill in other FPS
games but already in three hours of
playing the game I've ready had to
happen twice in this game so that's
definitely speaks for itself and how big
of a problem this is with battlefield 4
but anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this
gameplay commentary and if you have any
questions or comments then drop them in
the comment section below but as it
stands yeah I'm not going to be buying
battlefield hardline so don't even
bother asking me because EA is not
getting my money this time around anyway
guys hope you enjoyed this video and if
you did please give it a thumbs up and
I'll catch you in another tag video very
soon and peace out for now but</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
