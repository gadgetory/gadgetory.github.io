bill desk is something that needs a bit
of tech yes loving we've got here a
fractal defined case also a z68
motherboard as also as a memory
installed a cpu and a power supply so we
don't even know if this works but I
thought why not take you guys through
the whole process what goes through my
mind what goes into the cleaning and saw
the organization of getting something
like this up to scratch and replacing
dirty and broken parts if they need to
be replaced
so strap your capes on so strap your
used PC parts off so strap your use
potato cleaning capes on let's get on
with it
welcome back take your city what we've
got here is a really dirty fractal
design define r3 or r4 I don't know but
there's actually cobwebs down the bottom
too so that's how filthy this thing is
even dirt underneath the DVD drive but
the motherboard itself is filthy as well
and what we're gonna do is we can take
this thing apart piece by piece and this
is gonna save you time in the long run
essentially what you're gonna do is by
taking it all apart piece by piece if
something's faulty which I'm guessing
something is whether it be the memory
the motherboard the CPU or the power
supply then what we can do is we can
find that piece individually see what's
faulty and then replace it but also save
ourselves time and long run because what
we do is give it a quick and dirty
cleanse and something's wrong then we
will be pulling it apart anyway and
essentially wasting time but also these
drive bays as well they're filthy so I
think this is the best way to approach
this alcohol wipes in here everywhere
and just go around this whole build and
just really give it a nice texture of
and cleanse
so we've got all our parts laid out here
on the table and this is z68 from azuz
taking a close-up of this thing you can
just see how filthy it is and so we're
gonna do with this is we're gonna give
it a nice data vac session also on this
and the power supply and the case and
what this will do it has just lift up
all that initial dusts but you can just
see it's just so filthy I don't know how
it got this filthy when we're probably
gonna replace the cooler as well to
stock into a cool because that's just
garbage and it's just so filthy that'll
take too long for what it's worth and we
got the power supply here which is
actually - not bad as decent so 500 watt
power supply and it should be ample fine
for 3770k no gtx 1060 now looking inside
is fractal design case as well that's
filthy as well so hopefully the data vac
can lift off all the initial dust and
the alcohol wipes can come in and then
after that we hopefully won't have to
use brake cleaner if we don't need to
because the stuff is expensive and I
generally had to use it on GPUs and
motherboards just to really clean out
idiot grid ease
so now you may have these stickers and
you notice how much of a pain in the ass
they are to get off sometimes so what
you can do with them is just drench them
in wd-40 and then leave them overnight
if you've got time because what will
happen is it'll soak in and then it's
just so easy to get them off so that was
actually a tip from a viewer who let me
know about that so there's an extra
function of daily 40 so thanks for that
it's actually really works well so the
Donna vac really brought these parts up
and they're looking really good now all
we have to do is go over with alcohol
wipes and see how they come up I don't
think they will need brake cleaner
because after the alcohol wipes the
wd-40 should get off anything else and
make them look like brand new so what
are we waiting for time to get these
alcohol wipes to work
so we're gonna do now is get our 3770k
and deal it it and then drop it in here
but before we do that we might actually
just test everything out make sure the
bias is up-to-date make sure the
motherboards working also the memory is
working as well and the good news is the
motherboard works absolutely fine but we
did need this BIOS update this is pretty
important because we've put all this
build together to 3770k and then boot it
up we would have had to have taken the
cooler off and take the CPU apart and
put the old one in and update the BIOS
again which would have wasted a lot of
time
so here it is here the preliminary bill
we actually haven't done the cable
management yet and there's a reason for
that which is gonna boot it up make sure
everything works and if something
doesn't work we can change it over
quickly also this case itself it still
does need some feet underneath so we're
gonna go to Bunnings Warehouse now and
go pick up four feet for it and just try
and finish it off but we're gonna make
sure it boots first so we're going to
turn the power on right now and just do
a quick check and then after that we can
finish it off
so here it is here the finished product
and it is looking so damn good as you
can see it is just a world of a
difference from what it was before
we've also added in a 120 gigabyte SSD
so that's about 50 Australian dollars
added an extra 8 gigabytes of RAM as
well to make it really contemporary with
16 gigabytes of memory added in the GTX
1066 gigabyte swap the i5 2500 for a
3770k and we're using this aliexpress
cooler here this is it run really what
they do perform very well previously I
was going to use the two 12x from cooler
master but that was shorting out the
motherboard really bizarre problem I
smelled a little bit of smoke coming off
that as well
so I stopped using that cooler we're
also reusing the power supply here and
we were using the motherboard reusing
the case and using a 1 gigabyte hard
drive that was donated to the channel as
well so this PC all up is just really
going to scream hopefully it's gonna
scream when we start overclocking it's
just gonna start smashing those games
absolutely no problems but without a
sigh let's put the side panel on and see
how it runs
you see here we just got dirty towels
broken zip ties I decided to take these
things off as though just loose waste
the time trying to put them back on in
my opinion and this here is the dirty
Intel stock cooler we're actually just
gonna chuck this out because it's just
so so filthy I actually haven't seen one
this filthy before I don't believe at
least not on a z68 motherboard so that's
gonna go on the bin as well because the
time you're gonna spend on that cleaning
that it's not even worth it in my
opinion but yeah that's the rubbish pile
out of this so here we got the CPU now
running at 4.2 gigahertz and I know
you're thinking 4.2 gigahertz it's a
pretty bad overclock for a 3770k and yes
it actually is but the temperatures are
really good not even hitting 60 degrees
on full stress test here and the noise
is actually really quiet so I'm really
loving this setup however this is one
problem that I've seen only once before
and I haven't talked about it because
I've only seen it once before and I
couldn't exactly identify what it was
but now I have and that is just simply
the CPU at least one of the cause is not
running up to full power at least at 4.5
gigahertz 4.3 or 4.4 at 4.5 gigahertz it
would be at one point three five ish
volts and it would just crash
immediately with a blue screen and then
four point four and four point three
would give me Google's snap errors when
I load it up Google Chrome for example a
webpage and so that's pretty indicative
of just the CPU either being faulty or
just not being able to maintain those
overclocks
so that's a rare sort of thing that
happens and I've seen it once before now
syn it for the second time just with
higher overclocks here so it's at 4.2
gigahertz though it's running really
nicely at these temperatures noise is
really good now it's time to jump into
some games and see what this setup can
do and we've also got an extra hundred
megahertz on the GPU itself and also a
little bit of a boost on the memory
speeds on the GPU to also the memories
real mediocre we managed though to get
it to 1600 megahertz with pretty loose
timings at around 1.5 8 volt but it's
really old stuff so hopefully it does
the job
so here it is right here the restored PC
it is running so smooth and so good at
games 1440 by 34 40 ultra wide
resolution absolutely no problems for
this thing keep in mind I did have to
drop a few settings in some of those
games but it was a very enjoyable
experience and this was I mean half the
pots in this PC were otherwise parts
that people just did not want that
rather chuck in the bin because they
just want to go up not great to the
latest and greatest yet feeling like
this will perform just as good as the
latest and greatest CPU and motherboard
with a gtx 1066 gigabyte we're just
really revitalizing and rejuvenating
what we have here to not only make it
look really good but also perform really
good in the current titles today if you
have any questions or comments about
this restored and refurbed potato then
let me know in the comment section below
and we'll get back to you as soon as I
can and also don't forget to hit that
like button if you enjoyed this one and
stick around because they use monthly
parts on is coming very soon we've
already picked up a few deals and
there's hopefully some more to come
catch in the next one peace out for now
bye
ultra wide 13 44 34 40 but without a
side if time to put this thing in the
paces and that was only one of the many
PC parts that were donated here if you
guys enjoy this refurb stuff then
there's a lot more of it to come here
and to be honest I really enjoy bringing
up these old use potatoes there were
otherwise neglected back into something
that looks branding you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
