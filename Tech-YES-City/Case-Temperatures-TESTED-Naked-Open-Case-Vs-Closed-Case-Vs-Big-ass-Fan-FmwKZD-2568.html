just coming back to you guys today with
a video about which is the best way to
cool your budget case now I'm doing this
pacifically for budget cases okay as I
know that expensive cases are gonna have
really good fans and they're gonna be
set up really well so in my case on the
left it cost me only $50 and it came
with basically five cheap fans so on the
Left we've got no cooling at all no no
case fans at all just the naked case at
ambient temperatures in the middle we
have our push-pull configuration
obviously with air coming in from the
side and exhausting out I'm gonna put
these two fans on the top and the accept
the air is gonna exhaust out the top of
the case then on the last the last lucky
last here we are gonna have our trusty
big-ass fan cooling the naked case so
we're going to test all three methods
and we're gonna find out which one is
the best way to cool your case okay and
lastly our temperature I don't know if
you can see that but it's a 25 degrees
guys so we are 25 degrees
air-conditioned in this room so let's
begin first off we're gonna start off
with our naked case okay guys first up
we have the naked case let's put it to
the tip okay guys first method let's
give this a test so we're gonna run this
for five minutes maximum heat and we're
gonna let reel temp report our
temperatures so prime95 maximum heat and
we are just going to let this go for
five minutes and then we're gonna report
back and see maximum temperatures so and
see this is the first method naked case
the first test is just about done guys
so reached maximum of 72 77
seventy-three okay stop that okay up
second guys we have our case fans set up
guys there it is
there's case fans set up okay let's stop
the second test so a maximum heat power
and let's get a real temp count so this
is with push-pull guys so let's leave
that on for five minutes maybe a little
bit longer and we'll report back with
the maximum temperature settings okay
guys and the second method here we can
see that after about five minutes we
reach 67 72 and 74 watt on the one core
and 69 on the last score so there we go
let's try the third and final method to
see what we get and now guys we have the
third method which is the case with the
fan oh yeah so let's give this a try
shall we okay guys let's give method
number three a good benching so let's
give this a good hard benching and leave
it on for five minutes and see how we go
see what tense we come up with okay so
let's just leave that running yeah for
five minutes okay guys let's stop that
so as we can see here we got 66 72 72 67
so we are on the fan method we are
pretty damn low Hey
okay guys so there we have it the winner
is the fan the biggest fan cooling the
naked case however I was surprised and I
did surprise myself as I thought a naked
case was a pretty good method but it
finds out that the naked case is
actually the worst even on a really
cheap fifty dollar case which is what I
have as well
I've got a cheap budget case the
obviously the fans so there was four
fans that I used additionally so I
already had one fan calling the hard
drive on the naked case so I used the
for additional fans which were cooling
so had the push method so the two case
fans from the side were pushing air in
and the two fans on the top we're
exhausting air and this method did
pretty well as well surprisingly so I
guess I learned something as well today
so anyway guys if you want the best
cooling and you're on a budget case then
the biggest fan is what you want so
anyway guys if this helped you please
thumbs up this video and of course
subscribe to keep the brain easy going
peace out for now guys but</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
