brian coming to you guys finally with
the showcase of my dual CPU 16 core 30
through threaded workstation which I
managed to upgrade for around about 760
dollars however when I did the pre login
the pre build a lot of people were
asking questions about how does it
perform in video games so I'm gonna be
answering that question as well as the
other question of how does it perform in
a workstation environment also be doing
power consumption figures for you guys
and also detailing how much a build like
this would cost if you were to build
from scratch so without further ado
let's get on with it
don't come close I don't want you to see
so this last test I'm going to do is
just open up a premier project
this is Premiere Pro Creative Cloud this
is the latest edition and I'm just going
to show you guys this is the project
Juna kromm the actual vlog that I did it
was a huge video massive video and it
took a long like it was pretty rare very
resource-intensive so what I'm gonna
show you here is that this actually
takes advantage of all the threads
available like Premiere Pro will
actually utilize even when you're
editing and using this as a workstation
Premiere Pro will utilize all your
threads simultaneously so you can see
here everything's loading up that's a
lot of clips there to load up and we can
watch here on the processes you can see
that all those threads are just starting
to get loaded up which is great news
when it comes to not only rendering the
final video out but also when you're
working in a program like a Premiere Pro
so there we go the benchmarks are
finished and a lot of you guys were
probably wondering is this worth it and
the answer to that is an overwhelming
yes like this is the best project I've
ever done in my life not only was it
unique but it represents in my opinion
the best value for money you can get out
there if you've got workstation
productivity of mind now even if you are
a gamer and you want to get some EP
going on this thing still isn't bad
value for money though I would recommend
it to someone who has workstation
orientation in mind as their number one
priority and gaming second which is
exactly the boat that I'm in and some of
the things that I will recap on is that
the memory not only that the CPUs
phenomenal value for money but there's
64 gigabytes of ddr3 memory is
absolutely phenomenal value for money as
well and you see that I'm utilizing a
lot of that memory when I'm in the work
space at 4k and all the threads are
being utilized as well in Premiere Pro
so for someone with workstation
productivity in mind this thing gets the
biggest nod that I could ever say in
terms of value for money
now what about gaming when would you
want to go with this set up for gaming I
would say with dx12 around the corner it
is a great CPU in the terms of value for
money however the problem with it is is
that the motherboards do get very
expensive even in x79 single slot
motherboard will set you back around
about 150 dollars and at that price
point you start to get into the realm of
well should I get a 1231 Xeon and a
cheap b85 motherboard and just call it a
day and that's probably where I'd say
yes since the power consumption on this
dual CPU rig was quite high and even if
you step it down to one CPU it will
still be quite high due to that 12 times
multiplier being the lowest multiplier
so you saw there in idle temperatures or
idle power consumption I was still
pulling around about 200 Watts from the
wall which is quite high for idling
especially when you compare it to the
four core variants or even the six core
5820k
now some other lingering questions out
there the zone RDG and also the raid 0
the zona DG was absolutely fine once I
manually extracted a driver from the
unified zone our pack and that's hasn't
given me a problem since as for the raid
0 that is a question of risk reward
everything in this world carries risk
and for me the rewards far outweigh the
risk in that I get more than double the
speeds over a single hard drive and then
I put them together and slice off the
fastest petitions on both and that gives
me more than double the speeds of a
single three terabyte hard drive now
what about some other problems and
tuning this rig well there are two
questions I was actually going to make a
dedicated video for since I think a lot
of people out there with workstation
productivity in mind will want to jump
on this deal so I will be coming out
with another video on how to overclock
ECC memory which is actually very easy
on this board and also some other
options that you can do to tune your rig
to get the best performance out of it
possible and that's about it from me
today if you guys have any questions or
comments about the dual CPU setup then
be sure to drop a comment in the comment
section below and I will quickly recap
before I go productivity first gaming
second this is really where this rig
shines if you're a dedicated gamer than
there are some much better options out
there we're not much better but there
are some better options out there in
terms of value for money and also total
performance so I'll put some links in
the description below for you guys to
check out where to get these parts from
where to get an alternative secondhand
build that will do really well in gaming
and whatnot so if you like these videos
please give it a big thumbs up and I'll
catch you in the next one peace out for
now bye man you've got an azuz sonar in
there you've got a raid zero in a
workstation dude this thing's gonna be
dead in a couple of months someone on
the internet said that a wide-angle
converter is terrible well I guess if
someone on the internet said it jeez it
must be true what kind of what kind of
name were you going for this there are a
ton of great names for pcs out there you
gotta lose crazy like transformer names
for peace
