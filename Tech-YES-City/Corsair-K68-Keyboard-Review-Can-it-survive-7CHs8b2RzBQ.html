much just uh still on some coffee and
drinks on my keyboard
coursera back at it again and today we
have the k68 which is a full-sized 104
key keyboard with water resistant
switches so let's take a further look at
what this keyboard can do without
spilling any more liquids on me welcome
back to tech es city this is Brian the
yes man coming to you guys today with a
look at the K 68 which is a keyboard
that comes in both red and blue Cherry
MX which variants the red switched
version which I have here today has red
LED backlighting and the blue switch
version has blue backlighting and the
idea with this keyboard as seen in the
intro is that the switches now have
water resistant key covers that protect
the switches and the base PCB from
conductive liquids whether it be a
raging gamer spilling a soft drink or a
clumsy yes man like myself spilling his
morning coffee on the keyboard rest
assured the k68 will still keep working
and probably the best part is that you
can also pressure wash the k68 something
I'm pretty sure course they're never
intended I would do but nonetheless it's
one quick and easy method of cleaning
your keyboard that I am sure I'll keep
doing with the k68 after pulling off the
key caps which are double-shot abs
plastic you can see the red LED
backlighting underneath which is
adjustable by three levels of brightness
on the keyboard and if you use the q 2
software you can adjust opacity from 1
to 100 percent you can also choose from
a range of lighting effects and with the
software you can even layer in multiple
effects at once as well as offering
individual / key backlighting and
control so you can have a truly unique
look on your k68 if you want there is
further the option to change the polling
rates from 125 Hertz to a thousand Hertz
and you can program unique macros into
the keyboard as to help with your video
games like dota 2 for instance mini boom
o
though you can have all the features you
want but if the switches and the way
they're implemented a bad then the
keyboard will not be a good experience
and this is where the k68 gets it right
keys are very rigid and when typing a
very consistent all across the board I
also believe that the resistant sockets
at a slight damping effect to the keys
themselves which help reduce noise and
with the thick key caps included provide
a nice typing experience though I will
let you guys how to listen
the k68 weighs in at one point four four
kilograms has a two metre rubberized
cable and has one extra level of height
adjustment the backplate is metal and
above that and just below the keys are a
red faceplate which helps the keyboards
read backloading spread out evenly when
at night and does look quite nice
without being overly bright because they
also include a two year warranty and a
wrist rest on this particular keyboard
which is hard with a rubberized texture
and it was quite nice to type on on the
top right of the keyboard there is a
Windows lock brightness and media keys
and to the left of the keyboard are your
f1 2 F 4 keys which are close to your
num keys so pro gamers can reliably use
these as hotkeys in games - so really
when it comes down to it the k68 is a
very sturdy keyboard that you can spill
liquids on for days and not have to
worry about your keyboard breaking down
on you and this is certainly the big
advantage of the k68 even compared to
courses own lineup with more expensive
options it currently comes in at 100 USD
arena's 149 AUD and although being
expensive is definitely a keyboard that
is made to last the implementation of
the Cherry MX switches were good the
software works really well and the
typing experience on this keyboard
definitely makes the k68 a premium
option when it comes to keyboards it
also past the yes man spam test with
flying colors

us know in the comments section below if
you could spill some liquid on the k68

comments as always and I'll catch you in
