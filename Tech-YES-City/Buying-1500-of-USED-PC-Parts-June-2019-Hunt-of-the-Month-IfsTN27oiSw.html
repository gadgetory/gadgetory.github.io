there in the used parts universe it is
the end of the month and it's also the
weekend and that can only mean one thing
and that is a massive part hunt for
instance I've already been on eBay
snagged up seven a320s Zeus motherboards
for 30 Aussie dollars a pop which makes
it a phenomenal Buy now another thing
about those a320 boards I've heard a
rumor that they will indeed support the
new Matthias CPUs so this means that a
Zen 2005 3600 could be on the cards with
one of these cheap boards yes I know
they're not the best motherboards but
imagine the possibilities on a budget
with this kind of combination but on
that note of what's on the cards I need
everything this month from gravis cards
to power supplies to CPUs to RAM so
we're gonna go around and hunt for
everything but the first stop is heading
up to Brisbane where I've already found
an i7 4770k M where I'm picking that up
for a hundred and seventy Aussie dollars
and while we're up that way we wise will
pull into good old mate Liz and see what
he's got on display for us and see if we
can make a bargain so with that aside
get you used PC parts hunting capes on
or in my case get your new threads which
you traded to gaming PC for and let's
strap on in and see what deals we can
get this month
so we just got back from Brisbane and
that actually took a lot longer than
expected I had to go pick up two
separate deals here the first being
there's Dell on its own for a hundred
and seventy Aussie dollars
I think that's around 120 USD and it
actually had a forty seven ninety in it
instead of a forty seven seventy now it
has a hybrid SSD 500 you buy a hard
drive a gig of ram now with the
motherboard I don't know if that's going
to be any good at all because usually
with these Dells they've got those
proprietary power buttons and they give
error messages when you try to repurpose
them in other builds so what I'll
probably do is maybe take out the i7 out
of that put in the Sun like this and
then switch things around and try and
make some value out of that but we also
managed to pick up an optiplex 9020
these are actually really good because
all you have to do since the power
supply is in them actually quite good is
chuck in a graphics card like a 1650 or
something then you get yourself and all
awesome gaming PC that's ready to go
without pretty much putting any effort
into it at all and then of course the
last of the prizes are lenovo OEMs these
are great these are a staple
liz is hooking us up with those and then
we've got monitors gaming monitors too
we got about five of them and the whole
lot I think we got this four in total
150 for the optiplex
and 200 for the monitors and then also
650 for all these OEMs
plus an additional 170 for this Dell
right here so I'll put the total on how
much this costed in terms of Aussie
dollars on the screen for you guys as
well as USD for those folks
international but without a side let's
move on now to another deal where
someone's messaged me and they've
actually called me out they're like
Brian you've got to come out and check
out this Zeon deal that I've got and as
soon as I saw the word Zeon my eyes just
opened wide open and I had to get on
this so we're gonna go pick that up now
see what it's all about and they want
about 150 Ozzie dollars which just a
little over 100 USD so we're gonna see
what that deal entails because it's not
only just a Zeon it's also like a
motherboards a case of power supply and
all that other good stuff and the weird
thing is I haven't even started on
gumtree or Facebook
marketplace looking for deals so this
month is definitely looking like it's
going to shape up to be one of the best
months ever and then of course next
month once Zen 2 comes out you guys are
in for a special treat
so now we just picked up this bargain
right here well I'm kind of calling it a
half bargain because the stuff is really
dirty it's definitely been in a heavy
smokers environment and even before that
when this case came through its got like
all gyproc think you guys in the u.s.
called sheetrock
it's got like old filings and stuff like
that some of the stuff is really messy
I'm gonna have to sanitize it after I do
this voice bit here but what we've got
mainly the main prize is the 1270 v2z on
which I guess is similar to a thirty
seven seventy and we got the motherboard
we've got another motherboard with an
i-5 2400 we've got some two two gigabyte
sticks of memory we've got a turtle
beach headset so just alcohol wipe all
that down and then we've got two power
supplies which are pretty decent 650
watt antec and also a cooler power 700
watt I also picked up the Intel coolers
as well because they always come in
handy when you're doing builds and you
don't have a cooler or if you're pulling
off a really good all-in-one often not
overclockable CPU and yes believe me
I've seen that happen with trade-ins you
might think it doesn't happen but it
does we've got all the input/output
shields and I got this LAN cable here
but there was a lot of garbage in that
deal as well which I just left behind
because I'm not interested in getting
really old power cables for example
which is just gonna be absolutely
worthless in terms of keeping around
here but also in terms of me wasting
time cleaning it up so essentially we
just picked out all the good stuff and
left all the bad behind and we even got
a Core 2 quad motherboard I mean I was
told all this stuff works you know with
the amount of dirt on it I am definitely
gonna be double checking it and making
sure it works a hundred percent with
stability tests before I put any of this
stuff in gaming PCs for example but with
that aside let's give it an initial
sanitization because I just don't like
having anything unhygenic here
in the tackiest studio and also I forgot
to mention we got two 22 inch monitors
with the deal so I mean in terms of raw
hardware for the dollar we scored big
time for a hundred and fifty Ozzie
dollars here but again like I said
before a lot of it just it feels dirty
so I'm gonna have to definitely just
cleanse this all down right now with
some tech yes love it
now we're looking at these motherboards
monitors coolers and power suppliers in
a different light these have had a bit
attack yes loving and now they're safe
to put on the shelves and stack them and
looking at the hole in this light it
looks a lot better now two power
supplies five motherboards as xeon i5
2400 and we've even got this turtle
beach headset which i'm sure if someone
comes around you can chuck that in the
deal make someone happy then we've got
the i/o shields for the boards and that
case the core 2 quad which had the case
and the motherboard and the pounce
blinded i'm not even gonna do that thing
at night that needs some serious serious
tech yes loving before it's going to
come up well so considering it's
nighttime I'd say we did a pretty good
job
I also shout out to the crew over there
they helped us out they wanted to come
on the deals hunched and for the fam and
also Nate in the discord and yeah that's
about it for this hole right here 150
Aussie dollars I'd say I did pretty well
let us know in the comment section below
though what you think of this deal or
the previous deal we got from lenses
because now it's time finally even
though it's like 6:30 at night to go
check out good old gam tree and also
Facebook marketplace because I am in
need of quite a few things
so we just finished up a mega session on
gumtree looking for deals and this whole
thing about the rise and launch coming
up soon was n2 I would have thought
there would have been more first gen and
second gen CPUs available but there's
not basically what I'm saying here is
it's cheaper to just at the moment I
think at least in Australia the meta
would be to get those boards like I did
at the start of this episode and then
just go on Aliexpress and download some
CPUs from there cuz they've got some
pretty good prices and yet we're going
new meta with the terminology to just
download the CPU but continuing on with
the deals on gumtree we had a corsair
650 watt rated power play and that is
going for 30 Ozzie dollars and I put in
an offer on that there's some rx 570s
which he had three for sale I messaged
the guy and said look would you take 320
Aussie for all three of your RX 570s and
then there was also 1080 TI's available
two of them for 750 of pop each and I
put in an offer of 600 so waiting for
those guys to get back to me but there
was also another deal on ddr4 memory for
Trident Z stuff for 150 Ozzy for 3000
mega Hertz RGB stuff that looks really
good in a build it does help sell
especially higher-end systems the RGB
memory does work a treat but one crazy
thing is at least from judging from gum
tree we're gonna check out the Facebook
marketplace soon is that it seems like
graphics cards the mining deals are
running out at least here in Australia
so it's sort of a tough market where you
are going to be paying a little bit more
than what you used to and sort of all
those deals are flowing out now so I
guess it's a weird market because I
haven't done a parts hunt in Australia
for two months now pretty much because
last month we did it in Taiwan and so I
wasn't really looking for many GPUs
there or at least X mining GPUs so it's
funny how the market shifted in two
months but let's check our Facebook
marketplace quickly and then come back
to you guys and see what we've managed
to pull up there
s is pretty much the only good deal I
could find was a 430 watt power supply
for $19 policy so it'd be like 13 USD
it's not bad especially if it works okay
but Facebook marketplace the last avenue
to check out now was eBay and looking
for some rx5 70s and GTX 10 60s they
seem a little bit above market average
and of course the problem with eBay and
selling used graphics cards on eBay is
that the sellers have to pay the fees
have to pay shipping and that's why
getting those local deals is always a
lot better than going on eBay and
looking for those deals but sometimes
you can find good stuff it's just I'm
trying to exhaust every single Avenue
this month because I want to get as many
deals as possible basically but we're
gonna wait for some replies hopefully
some of those people get back to us and
then we'll see what magic we can still
come up with this month and here we are
now at the next day and some of the
people got back to me about some of
those graphics cards and I've got two
deals that are guaranteed they're just
waiting to get back from their holidays
on the weekend and that is the first of
all a 16 60 TI picking them up for 300
Aussie dollars they say they've only
used it for a little bit and it's pretty
much brand new with receipts from
warranty so that's a pretty good deal
considering the whole market and what
I've learned this month and this is
something to take home out of today's
parts on is the GPU market is drying up
in terms of really good deals especially
things like rx 570s for instance if you
guys are in the u.s. on eBay some of
those $85 rx 570s they're not going to
remain at those prices for much longer I
think once they start drying up and
people realize how good a value they are
you're not gonna see them really on the
market anymore so I'm kind of wishing
that I sort of went on the prowl a
little bit more a couple of months ago
because this sort of caught me by
surprise as I said before me being in
Taiwan last month for Computex and then
me doing this massive parts haul today
and that is 2 months things have shifted
big-time and I've kind of got to look
for another avenue now to get some GPUs
in bulk so I'll be checking that out I'm
not too sure yet I'm gonna have to go
back to the drawing
got a lot to do around here at the
studio especially in the next week we've
got the r-tx super coming up as well as
the X 570 as well as the RX 5700 so
three big launches within a week I
better get back to it but with that said
we've got that 16 60 TI and the kitty
we've also got a gtx 1050 TI now I
offered them 135 Aussie dollars they've
accepted it this is sort of the max
threshold I'm willing to go with a card
like this it's pretty much fair value at
its current price point but the thing
with the 1050 Ti is I'm specially
thinking that and that optiplex for
example I can mix and match that combo
pretty much just slot it in there and
you've got a nice little gaming PC that
you could quickly uptake a profit on in
the used markets so that'll be an easy
deal I'm picking that up tomorrow as
well as the 1660 TI when those people
are back on the Gold Coast so there
won't be too far to get those deals and
at their current rates they represent
pretty good value for money now in terms
of the other components things like
power supplies I was going to be buying
them when they're on sale in bulk as
well as cases you can get pretty good
deals on them there's sort of beat out
of the used market of course always
buying a used power play you've got to
check that thing out quite a bit because
if you guys didn't know in the past I've
had power supplies that have caused PCs
to boot for 10 or 15 seconds and then
they've caused the system to shut out
and when I've changed that power supply
around things have worked properly so
you've got three different rails there
to worry about 12 volt 5 volt and also
the 3.3 volt lines and if even one of
those is faulty then that will give some
weird symptoms so always buying a used
power supply be careful of that
motherboards are pretty straightforward
but I am just stock to the brink with
CPUs motherboards now especially after
those a320 boards and I got to look into
getting some more memory especially ddr3
terms of ddr4 the person got back to me
about that triad and Z stuff they 160
Ozzy pretty decent deal except my
thresholds 150 so maybe if they come
back and they say look I'll take the 150
then we've got another deal but as it
stands is the total for this month is a
little bit over
and we have I think seven monitors we've
got nine pcs we've got five more
motherboards we've got a foggy about two
ddr4 a three memory but all those other
pcs that we got from less early in the
deals they've got memory and also hard
drives in than two coolers motherboards
so that's why the OEMs are always a
really safe play because you're getting
the whole package in there and if you
wish to get low powered GPUs like 10:50
tea eyes then you don't even need to go
out and get another power supply so you
can save costs in that regard too but
value here let us know in the comment
section below guys what you think of
this month's pods on I'm just over the
moon at some of the deals I got this
month but of course that GPU market it
is worrying me a little bit I've got to
now go back to the drawing board and
look for a new Avenue on what's hot in
the GPU Michael because it current
prices especially some of the prices
these guys are asking for 980 T is and
10 seventies and stuff like that you're
better off just waiting for eBay sales
for example on new things like 1660s or
1660 T is where you're gonna get a lot
better of a deal in terms of buying them
when they got like a 20% off sale or
something so apparently that's coming
soon with the Amazon Prime sale where a
Bay's gonna counter that in Australia so
if you guys want to see maybe a deals
video where I point out all the hot
buyers on eBay for Aussies let us know
in the comment section below - with that
aside I hope you enjoyed this one if you
did then be sure to hit that like button
for us also let us know in the comments
section below
what you want me to do in next month's
part hunt do you want me to hunt those
rising deals and see if anything's on
the horizon because nothing in this
month's part hunt really represented the
value for money they're on the rise and
CPUs I only found the motherboards and
so as we said before Aliexpress was
definitely offering some better deals
when it came to those CPUs at role
purchasing prices I think everyone sort
of is not in the least in Australia
selling off their used 1st and 2nd gen
CPUs which is a little bit surprising I
thought then to buy now would have had
people selling off their CPUs but maybe
after the launch that's when you'll see
a lot of 1st and 2nd gen rising CPUs
coming on the market when people just
want to do a straight swap and then get
they're old CPU so hopefully that's a
scenario and next month part hunt is
going to be jam-packed and if you want
to see these videos the moment they drop
sub button and also ring the bell it's
down there and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
