brand-new XG 35 VQ monitor now this is a
35 inch 21 by 9 1440p display and you're
probably wondering what makes this 21 by
9 monitor different to all the other
ultra wide monitors out there well this
has one big benefit and it's the first
time I've tried it personally as usar
calling it ALM be extreme low motion
blur aka ultra-low motion blur aka
strobing which essentially matches a
flick of light to the monitors refresh
rate in this case since this monitor has
a hundred Hertz it will then flick a
light a hundred times a second so what
you get is less ghosting and easier
tracking since this was the first time
I've tried it I was blown away by of
course getting that color retention out
of the VA panels as opposed to a TN
panel but still not missing out on those
good response times since it does flick
one image a second it's not a subject to
noticing ghosting as opposed to a TN
panel which is really fast with its
response times so it doesn't really need
strobing at all this thing however when
you put on strobing you can still notice
a little bit of ghosting but it does
make tracking so easy I'll surprise them
the UFO test my eyes were just moving
with the UFO and I could notice how
snappy it was and in dota 2 when I was
name tracking it was so easy so if
you're into fast motion objects and you
want those gorgeous colors that gorgeous
contrast ratio of a VA panel but you
still want that snappy experience then
LMB as the Zeus is calling it is going
to give you that but it's also coupled
with a lot of other benefits too it does
support free sync it's got forty eight
to a hundred Hertz support and not only
that azusa f-- added in the feature
where it can display the actual FPS live
on the monitor itself so it's an overlay
where it has a diagram too so if you've
got an AMD freesync graphics card you
can then put it in and notice how your
fps is live on the monitor itself now of
course this doesn't work like river tuna
with its FPS display coming from the
gravity Scott it's just the monitor
itself so if you're not using an azuz
free sync card it'll just display a
static hundred all the time with all
that aside today I'm going to take you
guys through the whole nine yards or
should I say the whole 21 by nine
yards with the azuz XG 35 VQ so let's
get on with it
welcome back to tag yes City this is
brian coming to you guys today with a
monitor that's coming in at 770 us at
least that's the price on amazon if
you're in Australia it's about a
thousand and fifty AUD so it is
relatively well priced compared to the
US now for this money you're probably
thinking that's expensive for a monitor
but actually for a 35 inch ultra wide
monitor with a VA panel good response
times we'll get on to that later it's
actually a very good price I'm surprised
at how competitive azusa coming into the
monitor market and of course you get
that wrong branding RGB on the back of
the monitor and the light underneath
which you're able to change the plates
on and you can customize a plate
yourself so I decided to write YES on it
and I now have yes branding underneath
this sexy monitor here but besides that
on the back you've got a DisplayPort 1.2
HDMI 2.0 only in and HDMI 1.4 now the
DisplayPort will be needed if you want
to use the LMB won't work on the two
HDMI ports also if you enable the
extreme low motion blur you won't be
able to use free sync since it does
match that strobing to the hundred Hertz
specifically there is also no noticeable
flicking I tested through the Hertz
range on my camera couldn't notice any
flicker so it's flicker free which is
great the white uniformity as well is
very well balanced especially for a 35
inch curved which comes in with 1800 our
curvature across the hall monitor
backlight bleed was very well controlled
and there was no visible cross hatching
whatsoever with an orange background
pulled up now of course what about the
main hitting questions like the input
lag and also the response times say for
instance you don't want to use the
strobing feature
well they've actually got six levels of
overdrive built-in I found personally if
you didn't want to use the LM because
you can't use it with overdrive you want
to use the max level at level 5 I
noticed actually no ghosting at all to
my eyes and it did improve response
times a lot as opposed to level 0 also
when we're moving on to the input lag
Zeus have done this really well now I
recently tested the view sonic monitors
in here they were phenomenal they had
really low input lag Zeus's well have
nailed it extremely low input lag I
couldn't notice virtually any I mean the
total system input lag when me testing
at a thousand fps firing a bullet in
csgo
was solo so it's good to know if you're
buying a monitor like this in 2018
you're going to be getting a very good
competitive edge at least if you've got
a really good internet connection and
you're playing online competitive games
they're looking at the construction and
build quality of this monitor it does
have a metal base stem which is actually
quite heavy and it does have three
prongs with two of those legs being
longer than the third one it's also a
hundred mill height adjustable fifty
degrees swivel adjustable and also
thirty degrees tilt adjustable however
there is no adjustments for rotation so
you are out of luck if you want to stack
them vertically not that you kind of
would want to with a curved monitor on
the back of the monitor there's also
room for vase and mounting though you
have to take off the standard is tucked
away behind that stand the bezel and the
monitor is very low coming just under
ten mil however on the bottom I did
measure the Zeus raagh frame therefore
30 mil though that is pretty standard I
haven't seen an ultra-wide monitor that
has a real thin bezel on the bottom of
the monitor either now talking about the
brightness and the color change settings
with this monitor the profiles out of
the box are actually really handy if you
guys are like me and you love saturation
you'd love a really good look that's
sort of out of this world it's not
realistic that's what I personally like
for gaming then set this thing to cinema
mode and put on a LMB and you're gonna
be having a great experience now the
brightness settings the max brightness I
found was 300 ccd on max brightness
without a LMB but when we turn strobing
on the max brightness dropped down to
130 CCD so for me personally it was the
bare minimum at where I'd like to use a
monitor I do like to have around about
160 to 180 CCD brightness and normal
operation but 130 is doable especially
since the benefits that strobing bring
to the table of course with that cinema
mode giving a really good look for
gaming it's not realistic if you want to
do photo editing or video editing there
is a mode called srgb however when I
turn this on and then I tested it with
color calibration and the device it was
quite a little bit off so it wouldn't be
for someone looking to do video
your work or photo accurate work to get
those colors out of it or you would want
to have a device to color calibrate this
thing which is out of the box it was a
little bit out there keep in mind if you
do buy a monitor that's perfectly
calibrated out of the factory you will
be paying generally a lot more for that
panel as in case of the 4k viewsonic
monitor recently reviewed that thing
costs over 1300 AUD I believe however it
is a godsend for 4k video editing work
the XG 35 here though does have the
really good customization settings and
that's where we're going to move on to
now with the OSD you've got four buttons
on the side and then in a directional
button where you can flick through the
whole menu and access all the settings
some of the settings we spoke about
already overdrive settings there's also
picture and picture mode which will put
a little picture up the top from a
different source if you wish it to and
you can set the size of that if you wish
to - there's also picture by picture
which if you want to use this as
essentially two monitors even from the
same graphics card with two different
signals then you can - moving on with
the OSD as well you've got brightness
saturation contrast controls also full
red green blue control from 0 to 100
there's also a volume control which
relates to a headphone jack so plugging
in a pair of headphones I did notice it
was a little bit tinny the ADC onboard
is not the best but generally when
you're buying a monitor you're not
buying it for sound quality as that's
pretty much been the case with any
monitor I've seen in my life though keep
in mind if you do want to plug it up to
use with Skype it is a feature that's
there there's also besides that a USB
hub which has an additional two USB 3
ports and from the OSD itself you can
disable these USB ports if you're not
using them which is what I've done you
can mute that onboard audio - so a Zuse
do add in those options as well as the
RGB or a sink you can sync that to
anna's Oost motherboard and then have
your RGB on the back matching that of
your motherboard or any RGB lighting
from that motherboard itself there's
also the ability to put on the breathing
effects which I like to just the simple
cycling it looks really nice I keep in
mind the RGB on the monitor isn't super
bright so it's not really gonna stand
out but it does add to this
of the monitor itself and also from that
OSD which is actually very good it's so
detailed you can also do things like add
a crosshair in so if you're playing csgo
for example and you want to no scope but
essentially kind of cheat then you can
with this monitor by putting in a actual
crosshair now I'm not sure about the
actual official rules I don't think you
can use that in tournaments I think it's
actually banned but since it is on the
monitor itself you're not going to get
into any trouble using this at your
house there's actually two different
crosshairs and also two different colors
green and red so you can use this in any
game you can pull it up with a hotkey on
the side on one of the OSD buttons you
can also quickly select between your
color modes as well there's also the
ability to save for custom profiles to
which you can easily load and save just
by using the OSD menu itself not to
mention as well there's the ability to
control the transparency of the OSD
itself so here we are now a conclusion
time with the XG 35 V Q and this thing
here definitely brings something to the
table
oh pun intended but what you're getting
for the money it costs 770 USD or a
thousand and fifty AUD and it is pretty
much the best-in-class ultrawide monitor
I think out there at the moment the
reason being it has that ALM be you
switch that on you're gonna get a very
snappy picture out of this thing
you're gonna be able to track so well in
fast paced motion games but also the
user modes out of the factory pop on
cinema mode turn the brightness up to
max and with eel and beyond since the
LMB drops the brightness because it's
strobing and you're gonna get a
phenomenal gaming experience I was blown
away by games that support 21 by 9 Final
Fantasy 15 I'm definitely gonna be
making some free time to play this game
on this monitor because it was so
enjoyable now keep in mind 21 by 9 is
not going to work perfectly in every
single game for instance dota 2 if I've
got the tower in the middle of the
screen and then I move it over to the
left of the screen it stretches out
practically over double the size so I'd
rather play dota 2 in 16 by 9 csgo
however was a game that I think they've
updated the 21 by 9 support it did look
a lot better than it did on 16 by 9 so
games are starting in 2018 to mass
support 21 by 9 so it is a very
immersive experience especially with
that curvature I'm a big fan of curve
monitors when it comes to gaming when it
comes to video editing work I prefer a
flat screen so this thing it does give
you that immersive gaming experience and
especially for the price it is hitting
hard with the features that it has
low input lag good response times option
to put on a LM be free sync if you've
got an AMD graphics card and the light
anti mat coating as well which does
reflect off sunlight but still allows
colors to come through really well hey
guys hope you enjoyed today's video if
you did then be sure to hit that like
button and let me know in the comments
section below
what monitor you're currently using have
you tried an ultra wide monitor before
well better yet have you tried LMB aka
strobing this is my first time trying it
and I absolutely love it I'm looking
forward to seeing it in a lot more VA
and IPS panels I think that's where it
makes the biggest difference and also
big thanks to a Zeus for sending this
out for review it's gonna be my new
benchmark monitor and also free time
gaming monitor as well and with that
said I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye
ha however it isn't calibrated out of
the factory
a perfectly calibrated calibrating yeah
that's the word I guess calibrated is
the word I guess now it's sort of an
unofficial word
to the right of me here I to the right
of me here I have is so on the desk APIs
ID me I have the azuz XG 35 V Q now this
is a 21 by 9 monitor and it has a 35
inch wingspan from the diagonal to the
other diagonal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
