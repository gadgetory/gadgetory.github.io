easy just that's my username anyway just
here to do a review on today on the
logitech g3 so here's the box basically
get the boring part done first and
really quickly box all's it is a small
box comes with just the mice your manual
and your warranty card so that all you
want from a box anyway cuz it'll save on
shipping if you buy it off the internet
like I did okay so let's just get
straight on to the basics and what you
want to see this is it guys on the box
and reviews might say that it's 500
reports a second but actually if you
install logitech setpoint
it goes up to 1000 reports a second and
it's 2,000 DPI which is pixel perfect
for a 1080p monitor so it's got all the
specs you want now let's get to the size
and the feel of this thing all's I can
say is fan-fucking-tastic I mean it's
small it's good it's got what you want
from for RTS games so if you put that
there you feel that it just did grips
your hand really good so I mean I got it
because I wanted to get a mouse for RTS
games like Starcraft 2 cuz I had a
sidewinder x8 before and I found it was
just lacking and I couldn't stand shitty
mice because they're deep you guys to
 so basically it's soft like it's
got a soft grip on it which is really
good rips really weld it clicks
fantastic the arm the yeah the the
software is good the Logitech setpoint
software's fine doesn't doesn't show up
resources the cords really long 7 foot
and they click on it click on it's
really good
and if you're moving around through the
good now I probably you want to see the
size of my hand now I do have a pretty
big hand and if I measure it so if I
measure my hand my hand from I just put
that down
so put that down stable there's my suits
for work
my hand is 20 centimeters and my fingers
you can see my middle fingers about nine
centimeters so I do I don't know but I
think I've got really big hands cuz
every one I measured my hands against
hands are pretty big to the mice the
mice dimensions you can find them on
Google and the mouse feels fantastic for
Starcraft 2 and RTS games I've just
booted up before paying some and
fantastic guys so all's I could say is
Logitech G 3 is the win and if you are
thinking about getting one against a
razor or against the Microsoft whatever
do it because it's my recommendation so
it's good also it's got the these two
buttons on the sides they do not get in
the way if you're using the claw grip I
mean I haven't even come close to
hitting the button yet I mean if I had
really fat fingers then yeah maybe might
get close to doing it but never come
close to getting hitting those buttons
accidentally and basically yeah they
they're useful those buttons anyway when
you're browsing the net back and
forwards you click the left one and go
back if you click it will go forward
obviously I don't want to do that
because I'm video and that's about it
guys
Mouse is a Donna point I don't know I
might get a new one soon it's all rights
just standard so and that's the
logitech g3 good mouse no frills just a
standard reasonably heavy like it's
solid it's it's just a good good size
good weight and feels fantastic so for
pawning you want this mouse there it is
guys nice claw grip on it
probably get one we'll look on it that's
it's my hand there 20 centimeter hand
just feels fantastic when you wrist it
down you can get it all around alright
guys that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
