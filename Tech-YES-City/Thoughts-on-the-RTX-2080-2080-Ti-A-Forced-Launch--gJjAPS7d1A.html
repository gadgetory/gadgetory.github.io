generation RTX mm seriously
but post launched the hype train is
pulled into the station but there are
some serious concerns with the new
generation of these cards which we will
take a look at today so the biggest
problem with the RT X series launch is
that the entire thing just feels forced
and whether that's because Nvidia want
to lock people into higher end cards
before the launch of AMD's unreleased
Navi GPUs or even segment themselves
with different technology in the market
like ray tracing and Els s before
Intel's eventual release of their
dedicated graphics cards in 2020 or
whether it has to do with the massive
glut of 10 series cards that supposedly
needs to be cleared out we will just
never know but I do know one thing and
that is the 2000 series does feel like
there are other intentions behind this
launch the Nvidia that I'm used to using
experiencing and reviewing over the last
decade have never missed a beat and
their products have been near or simply
perfection itself the 2000 series
however though doesn't feel like
perfection at all to me and it feels
like a different bump in the road I
seriously think Nvidia would have been
better off holding off at least a month
or two to optimize their drivers and get
the new technology like rate racing and
DL SS implemented into some actual
playable games before release not to
mention that this release was so rushed
that I literally had two days to test
overclocked cross-reference double-check
and shoot and film an entire review
which somehow I managed to pull off
though there are some other weird
discrepancies that are occurring first
off the ray tracing functionality it's
so important to Nvidia that it's the
entire name of the graphics card itself
RTX however at launch and as it stands
now for me personally and for everyone
who pre-ordered there are no games or
even benchmarks that utilize the
real-time ray tracing so right now it's
a matter of hardware and waiting for the
game dev optimization and game devs
waiting for the hardware and a real
chicken and egg conundrum of which
should come first
for this reason shadow of the Tomb
Raider is waiting for a ray tracing
patch and battlefield has
straight up postponed but the fact that
in video is so confident in real-time
ray-tracing technology isn't necessarily
a bad thing
traditional rendering always needed a
replacement it was inevitable but
reviewers such as myself and all the
other awesome youtubers who reviewed
these cards really can't sit here and
benchmark hype no matter how hard we try
well actually I'm wrong Tom's Hardware
somehow managed to though jokes aside I
think releasing a new architecture of
graphics cards without at least even a
playable demo from Nvidia really makes
the cards seem like a new GTX lineup
instead of our TX for the time being not
to mention the raw performance gains
themselves just aren't offering the
value like any previous series release
of Nvidia cards have I remember the 1080
the 10 79 77 86 70 cards when they were
dropped and the excitement was there the
value was there and of course the
performance gains were there though
ultimately I think the losses here were
actually the pre-order errs who might be
disappointed at the lack of performance
for their very hefty investment but will
the long-term over-the-air improvements
like deep learning anti-aliasing driver
updates and ray tracing or the holy
grail of graphics be enough to bring the
value back rewarding early adopters in
due time will definitely have to retest
and compare the performance and
optimization in a month or two so
definitely stay tuned for that but many
people are saying Nvidia only did this
because they have the breathing room to
release a slight performance bump and
all the wiggle room to push their new
technology first with performance
increases being that of a lesser
priority this does seem kind of true and
the Y is actually quite simple and
that's because AMD haven't posed any
real competition for years now Vega was
a bigger flop than that of the failed
backflip and until it yet to spread
their wings when it comes to GPU
development though taking a look at
NVIDIA zone top-end GT X 1080 Ti which
trades blows with the RT X 2080 and if
you compare to the founders vers
founders it even beats it by a slight
margin as well as having those next-gen
features like ray tracing in tentacles
but in Australia for example you can
currently buy GT X 1080 T eyes brand-new
on eBay right now for as little as
$1,000 with the 20% coupon code which
comes in at four
hundred Aussie dollars less than the
cheapest 20/80 available and this is the
crux what you can buy these cards for on
the shelves right now not promised MSRP
s that retailers don't adhere to and of
course if you're willing to do a little
bit of local hustle or even eBay hustle
then you can get the cards off a fall
and minor for dirt cheap get them deals
folks you won't regret it and of course
be sure to leave your deals in the
comments below
I love reading that good stuff though
the real shiner of the 2000 series looks
like it is indeed the 28th et I though
the problem is that it's priced so far
out of realism to what we are used to I
think it's too much too soon to be
honest I mean we have seen over the
years a gradual increase in prices of
the flagship cards take for instance the
Titan in 2015 then compared to the Titan
X Pascal in 2016 there was a $200 price
hike but this time around it seems like
it's bang straight up there with a 70%
price hike over your previous TI cards
and you get the same amount of VRAM and
about 25% more performance that's a lot
of money and quite a hefty premium and
looking at our previous Titan X Pascal
release which was August 2016
that was $1200 - and offered an 84%
price increase over the previous
reigning 980ti
so the pricing seems way too close to
our Titan versus previous TI modeling to
be considered a proper TI card in my
opinion and let's take a minute to
remember that the Titan X Pascal was
over 60 percent faster than a 980 TI and
also performed over 35% better than a
GTX 1080 let's also not forget that the
1080i is still a beast of a card with
the 20 80 TI only pulling about 25 to 30
percent ahead so it's not getting any
worse but it will be getting cheaper for
the 1080 TI with the release of these
newer cards which doesn't mean the 2018
20 ATI a bad card they will still
perform better than 1080 TI named Li the
20 80 TI at 4k it's just when I do the
maths and after having buried my head in
benchmarks for the previous two days I
didn't really come to a proper
conclusion in my previous RT X 2080
video but now that I've had time to step
back and think about it it's just a real
shame in video launched this card so
soon because there
anything to show really even having just
one title properly utilizing this tech
to its full extent would have been so
much better in my opinion even just one
title utilizing DL s s and another
utilizing ray tracing would have been
fine too they will still see with the
Nvidia driver updates and also video
game updates how much in video were in a
rush to release these 2000 series cards
and or if they want to truly sell out
the overstock of ten series cards they
came from over production for what was
seen as continued throughout all of 2018
demand from - perhaps we should be all
thanking you know silicon they did us
gamers all a real solid or did they
those should also be mentioned that GPU
mining is becoming more and more
inefficient in returns of return on
investment and with Nvidia tailoring
cores to workloads such as tensor for
deep learning and RT calls for ray
tracing as well as improving on
efficiency of their traditional cuda
cores it makes it just that much harder
to justify a GPU for mining in 2018
hopefully deterring future GPU miners
from the newest generation of NVIDIA
GPUs though at the end of the day if you
wanted the best value for money the 10
series currently Trump's the 20 series
in my opinion but if you don't care at
all and want the best performance like
4k 60fps the 20 series cards and more
specifically the 20 atti will handle
that as well as supporting all those new
technologies that are still just demos
though if it's one thing don't worry you
won't be left out if you didn't
pre-order and never forget patience
really is a virtue though in conclusion
traditional rendering is undeniably
outdated but I can't help it honestly
feel just disappointed with the 20
series launch and I really honestly want
to know what you guys think about the 20
series launch to let me know in the
comments section below and if you
enjoyed this video then be sure to hit
that like button
love rating your thoughts in opinions as
always and I mean it just doesn't seem
like the in-video I know that's for sure
not the one that I'm used to anyway now
but without said I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye like bu why oh just
just by it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
