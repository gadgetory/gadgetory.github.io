bharat easy coming back to you guys
today with a video on AMD anyway i'll
stop there I'll take these sunglasses
off welcome back guys I'm going to be
testing today core parking and vs. no
core parking on the 8 core FX 8320 now
I'm also going to throw in a for module
4 core vs. for module 8 core comparison
so some people have said if you're
disabled for cause the games some
single-threaded or dual threaded games
might run a little bit faster so I'm
going to test that as well and anyway
let's get on with the results so
basically the reason I'm doing this also
is because I want to get I want to find
out what works best for the 8 core
before I get into the head-to-head
benchmarks with the Intel so anyway
let's get on with the results the first
was the first result is core parking
with battlefield 4 now this is 1440p and
ultra we had first off we turned to core
parking off and the average was 101
point 6 8 we then turned it on which is
the default so we turned it back on and
it was 102 point zero eight frames
basically it made no difference at all
in battlefield 4 and this is a game that
utilizes 8 threads by the way so let's
move on now to skyrim core parking with
skyrim this is a CPU intensive game so I
really wanted to test this as well so
between battlefield 4 and Skyrim we kind
of get the best of both worlds one that
uses 8 threads one that is CPU intensive
and what we had here was we had a
hundred and nine point zero 4 frames
with core parking off versus a hundred
and eight point nine two so there's just
absolutely no difference between the two
honestly just leave core parking on it
the default it makes no difference at
all it's just a placebo thing and maybe
some websites want to make money off you
by selling your program I don't know
anyway let's look at now four modules 4
cores versus 4 modules and 8 cores so
some people have said on the internet
that if you disable 4 cores and you only
use 4 modules with 4 cores you can get
better results in some CPU intensive
games so we tested it was with with
skyrim at 1440p on ultra and with the
fort with the default setting of 4 cause
Forks are four modules 8 cores we had
one hundred and eight point nine two and
then we turned off
four of the cause I think was called to
call for call six and core eight and we
had a hundred and four point four eight
frames per second so basically you want
to leave this on I mean you don't to
fiddle with the way the CPU works as we
saw there we saw a little bit of a drop
in fps and then we look at Star Wars a
game that I think actually utilizes
eight threads I'm not too busy showing
this but I know it is a CPU intensive
multiplayer game or it's a little bit
CPU intensive and what we have here with
four modules and eight cores we had
eighty point five two frames so this is
at 1080p on ultra and we had eighty
point five two friends with the default
settings and then with the disabled
cause we had 73 point three six so we
had a drop in fps again as well so let's
pull up so in conclusion if anyone's
telling you that core parking makes a
difference then just just point them to
this video because I'm telling you now
core parking doesn't make a
difference
the four modules for cause thing you
don't want to touch that you just want
to leave it on for modules and eight
cores the way AMD intended the CPU to be
used so that settles that and I'm going
to put my Wayfarers back on and get the
hell out of here and if you liked this
video please give it a thumbs up and if
you have any questions please leave a
comment in the comment section below and
also if you haven't read subscribe to
tech es city where I'll be getting some
more sunglasses and looking like a
douchebag and do it more videos you guys
peace out for now varanasi bait</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
