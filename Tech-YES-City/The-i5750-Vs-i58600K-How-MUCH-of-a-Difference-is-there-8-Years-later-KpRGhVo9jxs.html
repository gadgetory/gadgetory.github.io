comment section below that you love a
good used CPU and also a good used
motherboard so today I'm not gonna let
you down we've got an i5 750 and this
thing clocked all the way up to 4
gigahertz on a really cheap cooler this
is the T x3 from coolermaster
entry-level CPU cooler I was really
surprised and we're comparing that
against the latest and greatest
8600 K 8th generation versus first
generation i5
now the 8600 K does have two more cos of
course and it does have much better IPC
however this is eight years in the
making and back in 2009 this little I 5
750 was released for around about a
hundred and ninety dollars street price
it was also overclockable and with that
it came with a two point six six
gigahertz base clock and you could
overclock these things really high which
still makes them very popular even in
today's titles the 8600 K on the other
hand comes in with a street price of
around 260 dollars that's if you can get
one due to the limited supplies but a
cool fact is $190 to this day with three
percent year-on-year inflation-adjusted
would be around about two hundred and
forty four dollars so it seems like
there's a little bit of a price hike
going on there and also in my recent
1070 TI review I tested a lot of
different gravis cards the 1080 Ti being
one of them so I thought to myself why
not put this i7 750 up against this 80
600 K we have up here firstly destiny 2
now at 1080p we saw a massive difference
now keep in mind this is with a 1080 Ti
if you were using a lower end graphics
card even a GTX 1060 you'd be
hard-pressed to find a difference
between these two CPUs though with that
in mind there was a 100% increase with
the 86 hundred K and keep that in mind
it was also on ultra settings and this
was also with a frame trap of 200 FPS we
went up to 4k there was only a 20%
difference so in this game if you were
gaming at 4k there wouldn't be too much
of a benefit of getting an 8th gen CPU
eight years into the future over a
little I 5 7 50 on the latest graphics
card though let's fast forward things to
a Wolfenstein 2 here the i5 750 did do a
little bit better than the previous
title really a 1080p it only scored in
around 20
percent law with 170 FPS versus 210 the
order came to the 4k results we only saw
a 10% increase going to the 8600 cave
versus the i5 750 now moving on to Deus
Ex mankind divided now sometimes I do
like to have a bit of fun with the
titles just like this title I'm pulling
up for you now and we saw here this was
the best result for the i5 750 in all
the results here today there was really
no difference between these two at 4k 1
FPS on average and then of course a -2
on the minimum though keep in mind this
is an extremely GPU intensive benchmark
at Ultra settings at 4k on this title
there moving over to 1080p we did see
quite a substantial difference going to
the 80s down to the 60s so there's
around about a 30% drop going from the
8th gen to the 1st gen I 5 then moving
on to players unknowns battlegrounds aka
pub G there was actually quite a big
difference not only the average FPS
especially at 1080p we saw 80s vs. 130
with the 86 hundred K and also keep in
mind in that benchmark there was a frame
cap just to keep things equal with all
the other testing I did in the past
there was also the minimums or the 0.1%
lows in this test we're a lot different
I did notice some dips on the i5 750 so
it was still a good experience it was
just a lot better on the 8600 k
especially if you're playing
competitively though it is a good thing
to note that the i5 750 if you couple it
with some mid-range graphics cards will
give you a very enjoyable experience in
pub G moving up to 4k there was
virtually no difference just like Deus
Ex mankind divided however in this case
the point one percent lows were a little
bit worse off the last title I've got up
for you guys is Far Cry primal and we
did see around about a 10 percent dip at
4k going between these two different
CPUs the minimum fps also suffered quite
a bit more than the comparison of the
drop from the average FPS though 1080p
did see a much bigger drop and it was to
the tune of like almost double so you're
getting a hundred percent increase going
to the 86 hundred K over the i5 750 so
that's pretty much in a nutshell sums up
the results now I will reiterate like I
did before 1080 Ti it is the best
graphics card out there at the moment
for gamers I mean you can get better
graphics
you can do things in SLI but really for
the realistic folk out there the 1080 Ti
is pretty much the best in slot out
there at the moment though it does get
better the good news for the i5 750 is
it did perform really well and we look
at the absolute figures not just the
comparison figures it did perform really
well if you're into destiny too you can
get a hundred FPS out of this CPU if you
overclock and that's gonna be really
good for the majority of gamers it's
gonna be a lot better than a console and
this is coming from a CPU that's eight
years old now one thing I didn't do too
well on with this was the memory over
clocks I was using some really generic
underpowered stuff so in future
comparisons I will try and get some
really good ddr3 memory and see if that
makes a bit more of a difference on this
platform I also look forward to giving
you guys some more in depth test with
these used parts but really when it
comes down to it you can pick up the i5
750 s for a bargain price in today's
market also if you find yourself a p55
or age 55 motherboard then you've got a
really potent combo when it comes to
gaming I mean it was a hundred percent
the worst case scenario and that was
with the best graphics cards so really
when it comes down to it it is a great
Buy the i5 750
so really the worst we got was a 100%
drop and this is eight years in the
making which really isn't that
impressive at all and you can see that
Moore's law is coming to an end has
actually come to an end a long time ago
on my opinion 100% in eight years it's
meant to be doubling every two years so
with pretty much 25% of Moore's law if
we were to do these gaming benchmarks is
any sort of indicator so anyway guys as
always I hope you enjoyed today's video
if you did and be sure to hit that like
button and let me know in the comments
section below are you a fan of the used
price-performance PC parts you little
lie 5 750 he does do all right and I
know there is the Xeon X 3470 that's my
favorite however I just had this I 5 750
on hand and of course I wanted to see
how far the i5 generations of CPUs have
come and they don't include hyper
threading usually the 80 600 k still
doesn't include hyper threading so the
great apples to apples comparison in the
i-5 cents even though the prices and of
course the age of these CPUs does differ
by a lot it as I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon possibly some you
PC pot sunny on good old gantry and all
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
