recent NVidia stock prices
have dropped roughly
25% over the last week
and may even continue to drop.
Though what is with such a massive drop?
Some are saying it is due
to the cryptocurrency market
completely being
non-existent for GPU mining
though some are saying
that this is fake news
and NVidia simply missed
the revenue forecasts.
An honest mistake they would say
but around Tech Yes City
we're always gonna give you
the straight down cynical
truth hurts approach.
(upbeat music)
But before we do get
into the juicy GPU market
and crypto news today's video
is brought to you by Squarespace.
Have you ever wanted to make a website
for your small business
and went and got a quote
from someone and they've
wanted to charge you
thousands of dollars to make something
that you may not even like?
Well, they've got easy to build websites
you can select from
many different templates
and it will guide you through things
so you can have a self-managed
easy to edit website
up in no time that will look professional
and will save you a lot of money.
And speaking of saving money you can use
the Tech Yes City link below to save 10%.
Let's get on with it.
So to say that the cryptocurrency demand
has had nothing to do
with NVidia stock prices
would be a huge ignorance of
fact at least in my opinion.
I mean even NVidia themselves
have blamed missed forecast
around the fact that there
was a massive pent-up demand
for 10 series cards during the crypto rush
which has since waned
off greatly since June
and now it's practically non-existent.
That is the demand for graphics cards
for cryptocurrency miners
and this in turn created
a massive oversupply of cards
that simply aren't selling as well as
they would like them to
or at least forecasted to.
Another massive contributing
factor on top of this
that I see no news articles talking about
is that during this
cryptocurrency boom time
there were many accumulated graphics cards
which in turn are now
being sold off to gamers
for a much cheaper than retail price.
They in a lot of cases
still have warranty too.
So not only is there a massive oversupply
but there is an increasing competition
from the used second-hand market as well.
One could say it's a stone cold sandwich
with perhaps green lettuce
being smashed in the middle.
Though in relation to the
said forecasts themselves
revenue missed original
estimates of $3.23 billion
and came in at 3.18 billion
in earnings per share
after stock adjustments
for quarter three 2018,
came in at $1.84 per share
missing the projected $1.94.
However the revenue forecast
has now been adjusted
for the current quarter to
2.7 billion gravely missing
that of the analyst 3.4 billion and here's
where the massive panic
like sell-off has begun.
When companies miss market
projections by a lot,
this is generally a catalyst
for stock prices to drop
and drop a lot they have.
Though it's not all bad news.
Gaming revenue has rose 13% year-over-year
and there are other
segments like data center
and also automotive has
also experienced growth
and even beaten estimates.
So it seems like NVidia's
stock really just got caught up
in a game of easy crypto
money and now they are paying
for it and quite literally.
Though another hopefully good
thing to come out of this
is that NVidia will hopefully realize
what made their company grow so rapidly
in the last six years and
that is simply innovation
and bleeding edge performance.
I honestly feel like this
round of RTX series cards
hasn't been the best
release and in fact I'd say
it has been the worst release from NVidia
since the 400 series cards.
Where I'm used to seeing
more FPS better prices
and ultimately more efficiency
I was personally left
with a card that has features
that don't work properly
a month after release and also
offer a mediocre improvement
in price performance for
current gaming at bests.
So hopefully NVidia can get
back to the traditional formula
and continue to give
us gains year-over-year
and even if they don't I
think they'll be forced to
with Intel coming to the
GPU game in the coming years
and also AMD dropping their
7 nanometer Navi solutions
though speaking of AMD
their stock has suffered
a similar downtrend though
a more prolonged one
which is a little bit perplexing
since the stock prices
have dropped basically
40% since their peak
in September which despite the success
of both Ryzen, Threadripper
and second generation CPUs,
GPUs sales have suffered a
similar if not worse a fate
to that of NVidia and in quarter three,
they released their figures
which showed a $150 million
shortfall in GPU sales to
where they only expected
a $50 million decline.
A massive drop in GPU demand
compared to the first half
of 2018 saw their revenue decreased by 6%
in total compared to the previous quarter
despite strong growth in CPU sales.
Intel on the other hand
hasn't seen the kind of falls
that NVidia or AMD have seen which would,
despite some naysayers indicate that yes,
the crypto market just as much
as it raised graphics card
prices in early 2018 is
now still causing damage
to markets though ironically enough,
the first time the pain
was on the average consumer
this time around the pain is reversed
on the big corporations.
Buy AMD stock, buy NVidia stock,
could've, would've, should have.
I've said in the past I will
never touch stock markets again
after 2008 and I probably never will.
They just don't make
any logical sense to me.
I remember jokingly telling Yusuf here
that shorting NVidia stock back
in August would have been a good idea
though the stock only
continue to defy logic
since August and grew to $290 in September
and I honestly think
overdone drop in price.
Though ultimately yes, I
believe crypto is to blame
for the recent downturns on AMD and NVidia
just as it was the catalyst that helped
rise those stock prices to new heights,
it is now the catalyst control
center, all pun intended
that is bringing them down.
Also GPU mining itself
has now been overtaken
by ASCI miners.
These are miners dedicated
to mining cryptocurrency
algorithms and interestingly enough,
a company called Bitmain
is on track to bring
in over more than 10 billion
in revenue in 2018 alone
closing in on that of NVidia.
So crypto is no joke
though as for crypto itself
that's the worst that
has been in a long time
with Bitcoin reaching
below $5,000 US dollars
and Ethereum breaking new one year lows
dipping to below that
of $150 as of recent.
So like all things present
we can't predict the future
but perhaps this is beginning of something
much much more dire so do tread lightly
if you invest heavily in these things
as when the easy money dries up,
you only have the hard
dollars left to contend for
and believe me they can sometimes
get very hard to contend for.
