is brand coming to you guys today with a
review of the RX 4 80 this is a retail
sample I have here and this is AMD's
latest and greatest offering on the
round the $200 price point so let's get
on with the benchmarks and see how it
performs and I'm going to be comparing
it with a GTX 970 g1 which is
essentially a GTX 980 it compares
similar to that and also I throw on some
other cards so let's get on with it
seelix from
so then we have the benchmarks are in
and this thing impressed me a lot mainly
because this is the reference model so
with all those cards that are yet to hit
the shelves the custom coolers with the
over clocks and whatnot we're going to
see some big numbers coming out of this
200 or $240 price point card depending
on how you look at it now this is the a
gigabyte model that I have here and it's
more suited towards someone who wants to
go with crossfire or wants to play at
1440p though if you're going with the
$200 for gigabyte card you're going to
get excellent performance at 1080p
also another thing that I look at is
that firestrike overclocked score which
I managed to obtain there was thirteen
thousand seven hundred points and then
handily beat the g1 which got thirteen
thousand two hundred points and now this
card is a really good overclocker it's
one of the best GTX 970 s out there not
only the fact that it's that costume
model but also I can get this thing up
to like fifteen hundred and fifty
megahertz completely stable 24/7 so very
good sample here and it does compete
with this card and though this card does
beat it when it's overclocked and that's
great news because these drivers are
also in the infant stages as well so
this thing with some driver updates and
with those custom models to hit the
shelves I can only imagine that this
thing is going to get a lot better
however with all that said let's talk
about the reference card itself it
actually runs really quiet on out of the
box settings so the fan profile will be
quiet
although the card will get hot I managed
to see around 85 degree temps there
though when I did set the fans around
the mid range the noise crapped up a
little bit however the temps were
dropping down to around about 75 a
little bit under that and if I boosted
it up to the max fan speed just to get
those aggressive overclocks
I did notice that it was extremely loud
I'll let you guys have a listen
also talking about the technical specs
of this card it features an 80
millimeter fan here which blows air out
the arse of the card it also has three
display ports there one HDMI port which
will allow you to hook it up to a Korean
panel if you have a DVI converter there
and also if you install the drivers
first so to keep that in mind if you're
running this with those Korean panels
you have to install the drivers first or
at least I did before this card would
put out a signal also the card itself
has 2,304 stream processors on a 14
nanometer node process from Samsung
there that's the FinFET technology it
also comes in a 4 gigabyte and a
gigabyte flavours which the flow
gigabyte one is meant to be coming out
of $200 and this one is hitting the
shelves at around 240 dollars also
included with the driver update and
release of this card is a software
package from AMD called global Walkman
and it is actually really good you can
control the power the voltage and also
the fan profile curves right in one
little package there so it is very
intuitive very easy to use and I'm
looking forward to seeing what it can do
with the custom cards when they hit the
market as well and also one last thing
that I will touch on it has one 6 pin
connector there which allows 75 watts
through the card and also the PCIe
connector there which will allow another
75 watts of power delivery to the card
so for a hundred and fifty watt TDP in
total and also one more thing that AMD
touts about this card is the
affordability with VR performance so it
is meant to be a very affordable VR card
though I don't have a VR headset to test
this with yet I'd love to get one in the
future and test the claims that this
thing is an absolute killer for the
money so ultimately where do I stand
with the RX for 80 I think this is
actually one of the best reference
coolers I've seen while it's actually
surprising how solid it feels weighs
about 680 grams and it also performs
pretty well in practice I was surprised
for a reference card like this usually
they're ridiculously loud out of the box
this thing was pretty cool pretty quiet
and did a great job of cooling the whole
package one thing I will say is I'm
really looking forward to the custom
solutions I think that that's when
you're going to see the real
big numbers you're also going to see the
real big competitor come out when you
see those custom cards especially with
factory aggressed over clocks there and
this thing managed to hit around
thirteen hundred and fifty five
megahertz on my sample and this is a
retail sample so you can expect to see
some good numbers coming out of these
cards in the future though ultimately I
would have liked to assent a little bit
more performance come out of the RS for
a despairing kin the node they're going
from twenty eight nanometer all the way
down to 14 nanometer I thought they
could have done a little bit more
cemented in that league above cards like
the GTX 970 and I thought it would have
been an absolute monster and a lot of
people like myself we're expecting it to
come in just a little bit more though as
it stands this card is currently the
best value for money in its price
segment at the moment and I can highly
recommend it though I would personally
wait out for a custom design there from
some of the board partners so I weighed
out for those if you can be a little bit
patient they'll be hitting the market
soon and they will be absolutely
kick-ass so this card is currently the
best value for money in its price
segment that's cement and we have to
wait to see what Nvidia will do their
GTX 1060 s and whatnot but I will say
one more thing before I close out and
that is the doom benchmark even though
the Nvidia card scored a big victory
there in frame rates I thought at this
exact same quality settings this card
looked miles better on the 1440p the AMD
image quality coming out of my monitor
from what I was seeing was looking miles
better I preferred playing on lower
frame rates on high with this than I did
on the GTX 970 so it's something that
I'm going to have to look into but it
definitely was notice a big difference
there sorry guys
let me know what you think about the RX
480 are you going to buy one are you
going to sit it out but whatnot let me
know I'd love to read your comments in
the comment section below and if you
enjoyed this review then be sure to give
it a big thumbs up and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
but is it too much to say I'm sorry they
got you with the Biebs new video though
I will say is it too much to ask for a
little bit more performance out of a big
note shrink going from 28 nanometer to
14 nanometer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
