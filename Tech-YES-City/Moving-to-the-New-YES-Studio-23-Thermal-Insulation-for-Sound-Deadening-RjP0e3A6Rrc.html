you can buy absorb sound and reduce echo
and here we are here with the end result
we have reduced the echos so much I'm
just shocked at the difference it's
night and day we went from the worst
case scenario with just audio bouncing
off the walls and sounding horrid to
having it just really sound like a
studio now like it just sounds so dead
like the reflections are just all gone
so that answers that question guys
thermal insulation just this is the
cheapest stuff we've got this whole room
as big as it is it costs like three
hundred and something AUD to shoot the
whole thing welcome back to tech
yesterday and I hope you guys enjoyed
that little intro today as part two of
the three part series where I'm going to
be completing my new studio and once
it's done we'll be able to make a lot of
good content but in the meantime until
then it's a lot of work of course it's
actually a really big room but also this
is my office here at the moment it's a
stopgap until I actually move in there
and as you guys know with coffee lake
being released and a lot of other videos
coming through the pipeline I've just
been so busy I've had to keep up this
rhythm as well as do the studio and you
know what I actually love it it's a lot
of fun you guys are here enjoying every
step of the way but let's detail what is
going on downstairs and what I intend to
do with this new studio and of course if
you guys have ideas what you want to see
drop a comment in the comment section
below as well I love reading all these
new ideas you guys constantly in every
single video I do give me awesome ideas
which I will be doing and I have done in
the past with a lot of videos so now
what we're doing with the studio here is
we're putting a steel frame in front of
the concrete walls and the reason for
doing this is that the walls are
actually bowed out a little bit so if
we're doing stick-ons it would be very
hard to even out the gyprock I think in
the u.s. you guys call gyprock sheetrock
so it's a company that makes it over
here they just call it jib rock you can
see here the powerpoints I'm gonna have
to remove
them and I also want to bring them down
around about 300 mil that'd be great for
the desk level now also we've got pipes
running through here as well so I want
to wrap some sound deadening around
those pipes just you know when someone
goes to the bathroom and if I'm
recording I won't have this water sound
running through but you can see behind
those frames we're actually going to be
installing the thermal insulation now
this is our one point five seventy five
mil thick thermal insulation from
Bradford we picked this up in Brisbane I
got a foot under three Australian
dollars a square meter it was actually
the cheapest thermal insulation I could
find by ahead longshot I think the
company in themselves that sell it
direct to the public were charging like
50 Australian dollars a bag I went
through some third party on the internet
and got it for like $30 a bag so this is
a strain dolls too so it's very cheap
and also in Australia we have the are
1.5 rating and if you guys in the US I
think you use like an r8 or an R 9 or
something like that that'd be a similar
rating but anyway guys we're gonna get
on put this thermal insulation in and
try and change a few things up in the
studio and get progress started
so hopefully that answers the question
for you guys of regular thermal
insulation being used for acoustic
purposes it does an extremely good job
so what we've got left now I'll show you
guys here is the cabling in the house
this is another thing that we're working
on over the last few days as you can see
you have got rj45 this is actually cat6a
I'm running this inside the walls and so
this is going to be like a little server
I'm gonna run down in this media room so
we're gonna run a little server down
here and we've also got our some speaker
wire because I love a good 5.1 surround
system so I'm gonna try and stall that
in all the corners and also we've got a
intercom going down here as well that'll
be over there so there's some coax and
an rj45 again there's a security camera
going down here too so there's a lot of
stuff that I'm just really putting all
my savings into this media room it's
really gonna be awesome once it's
finished today actually this morning the
sheets will be going up too and so we've
actually got the chippies doing that
because they've put the frame up as well
and they're gonna put the sheets up too
because that's sort of one thing that I
don't want to do myself because I don't
want like they're being bows in the
walls and stuff like that but the rest
of all that stuff we even do the
painting and stuff like that but yeah we
left it to the chippies to do the jib
rock and the frame and now we're really
good as well so that was really quick
and they're doing a really good job
so here's the rack here at the moment
this is on the second floor so you see
here this is the main hub there's a
switch there with also power over
ethernet and there is our adsl2 plus
broadband modem so hopefully that will
get upgraded to better internet in a
couple of months they said their
provisioning out the NBN in like January
2018 so I can't wait for that that'll
mean better uploads that'll mean streams
coming back for you guys now also
another cool thing Decco sent over this
paint your home and Wi-Fi so these are
wireless access points the AC 1300s so
apparently you can get these and put
them anywhere in your home and then plug
them up to each other and install an app
and then have like this little home
network within itself which is operated
Virant app however one thing that I
found a little bit disappointing about
this unit was that it wasn't a p OE
power over ethernet so I was actually
gonna install one of these in the roof
in the middle of the in the room and
then just run it over p OE and that way
i could run the wires inside the wall
but since it does need a USB cable like
actually power via charger it's going to
be a little bit hard to run these in the
walls because of this charger so i would
have liked to have seen there's been our
p OE that would have made a real big
difference I could see myself installing
these the wiring for these in the walls
and sort of having them look really
clean because they do look really good
like there's a simple circular model and
they are pretty cool in small access
points and they do have five gigahertz
Wireless support but also 2.4 as well
you know guys let me know in the comment
section below if you've used the AC 1300
if you have any tips or tricks and what
you'd like them what you don't like
about it also if there's a better
alternative let me know as well because
yeah that USB sort of charging port sort
of just yeah it's a little bit a little
bit annoying I would have loved to us in
that POA but we're in this room here for
a reason because we've got a
other youtuber his name is rocketjump
ninja and he does a really good
peripheral reviews so I'm gonna be
building him a new gaming / streaming PC
probably in the next month I don't know
exactly when it's gonna happen but we've
got all or a lot of his parts of rocked
up here and we're gonna build him one
insane PC so without giving too much
away he's going to be using an x3 70
motherboard he will have a rising CPU
and eight core 16 threaded beast but the
rest of the specs like the GPU and how
we're gonna tune this thing in the games
that'll be in the video also if you have
some questions for rocketjump ninja and
you want me to ask them let me know in
the comment section below
so know guys I hope you enjoyed today's
vlog a lot of you guys were asking me
like where's part 2 when's it coming and
so I was gonna do it once the sheets
were on and the plastering was all
finished so we still have to do of
course the shading and then paint the
room and put the carpet in so that'll
all remain for part three but I might
even turn this into a four part series
because even if we finish the media room
we still will have to decorate it and
put in the DES and get the computers set
up and do all that stuff and that's
gonna be still a massive mission to
complete so that is really a lot of work
to do but I'm just looking forward to it
as always and thank you guys so much not
just in the comment sections and every
time you guys hit that like button and
watch the videos but also as well big
thanks to the patron supporters to
helping out every bit of money that I'm
earning from the channel at the moment
is going back into this studio it's
really exciting absolutely loving it
super excited but as you guys will know
like things like this foam and stuff
like that the acoustic foam it does work
a good analogy that I read on the
internet was from this one person who
posted an excellent article I'll put the
link in the description below but it
just made sense he put it into all logic
and it was like if you want to reduce
echo in a room think of it as like a
little bouncy ball and you've got a sort
of put in soft stuff and that will drop
the sort of echoes but if you want to
say for instance
proofer room and that's where you don't
have any sound leaking from that room
then think of it as water filling up in
the room and like when you think of it
it's like yeah that makes sense so kind
of like put that to the test and it just
worked extremely well so big thanks to
that person who made that article
absolutely loved it can't thank you
enough because it just yeah play that
logic I was like yep thermal insulation
really cheap and it got the job done
anyway guys I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon both the used parts
and the new parts they will be hitting
the channel and peace out for now bye
so now what about some other things
going on with this studio you probably
see behind me up here there's a pipe and
there's actually yet clothes wrapped
around that pipe this is just because
when someone would go to the take a dump
this is because when someone would go to
the toilet upstairs for example all that
water rushing through the pipes you
could actually hear it it was pretty bad
so we wrapped clothes around all the
Bend points and that really did a good
job as well of completely sealing out
the sound so we've kind of done
everything on the cheap here in terms of
sound and audio work and it's just
worked out better than I could have
