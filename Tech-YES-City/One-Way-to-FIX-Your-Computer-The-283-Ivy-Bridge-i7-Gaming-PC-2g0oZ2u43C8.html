build a PC that was actually really good
value for money it's coming in at 283 US
dollars or if you're in Australia 362 or
strangles even has some new parts has an
8 threaded CPU has a gtx 780 and it will
perform really well in games but when
we're going to boot it up the first time
came into a really bizarre problem where
the computer just wouldn't switch on at
all
however after doing a few different
things we've finally now got this
computer working in exactly the same
configuration as we had before but
nothing changed so what really did
happen to the 280 dollar PC let's find
out
welcome back to tech yes City this is
brian coming to you guys today with this
PC diagnostic problem that you guys may
have and actually I kind of shouldn't be
doing this video because in ways this is
how I get the bargains the parts don't
work and then we get them working and
then we make a bit of profit on them on
the side but don't tell anyone that
that's a little secret
sorry we're onto the parts themselves
let's total up the build cost here 3770
i7 we picked this off 450 Australian
dollars also came with the cooler and
the Dell motherboard this was in an XPS
8500 that had the RAM pulled the hard
disk drive pulled and then I had a
refurbished power supply so straight
away I was like well something on this
build probably had to do with the hard
drive being faulty or the power supply
being faulty so I was just gonna remove
the motherboard and give it a transplant
into a different case and because we
just finished up using the bento which
was my mom's old PC case I thought that
that would make for a really good
Transplant case since of course we
essentially got that case for nothing
though onto the gravis card we have a
GTX 780 we picked this up in a recent
bargain hunt for 150 Australian dollars
a really good graphics card if you are
on a budget keep in mind you will need
however a decent power supply to power
this and that's when we're using a
server grade FSP pass by 39 amps
available on the 12 volt line we pick
these up in Japan for around about 15
Australian dollars now the thing with
these power supplies is as I've said in
the past and why they don't work that
well in Japan
because depends a hundred volt and
sometimes that dips down to 90 volt and
these power supplies are only rated from
100 to 240 volts so in Australia they
work exceptionally well as opposed to
the Japan they might not be working that
well with dirty wall power but anyway
the power supply is there another
bargain to be had and when I go to Japan
always manage to pick up so many of
those power supplies because they're
just such good value for money
now on to the memory I actually bought
this stuff for around about 7,000 yen
when I was in Japan this is a 16
gigabyte kit two sticks of a gigabytes
of ddr3 memory at 1600 speeds this was
even when ddr3 prices were expensive and
they are still expensive to this date so
consider these brand-new parts then we
move on to another brand-new part of
this build and this is a one terabyte
hard drive from Western Digital 62
Australian dollars so this brings the
whole tally of the build up to around
about 362 Australian dollars or again as
I said before 283 USD now the build very
good performance we're talking pub G
really good frame rates 1080p medium
settings we go on to overwatch again
great frame rates at 1080p high settings
always over a hundred fps and then we're
moving on to other titles like f1 2016
absolutely no problems on this rig but
you look at GTA 5 a very popular title
and on this rig with the 3770 in its 4
cos 8 threads it did a fine job of
playing GTA 5 with smooth frame rates
now we move on to csgo the last title I
tested on this rig again absolutely no
problems this build here was complete
overkill for csgo maintaining over 200
FPS at all times now keep in mind the
CPU isn't overclocked 3770 comes out of
the box with a rated speed of 3.4
gigahertz it turbos the 3.9 gigahertz I
believe and even 3.7 on all cores so
it's not exactly the best performing CPU
out of the box and certainly if you look
at the other build that I've built
recently with a 3770k
which is the same CPU but overclockable
we've got that up to four point eight
gigahertz and in 3dmark fire strike the
physics scores showed the big difference
we had 9700 points on this rig and we
compare that to the 3770k rig which had
twelve thousand four hundred points so
that's literally over a 30% increase on
the same CPU but just
overclocking which is why I always
stress
to overclock your parts if you can
because you're gonna get free
performance and it's gonna really show
especially in today's titles unused
hardware though the last crux of this
build was the memory 1600 megahertz ddr3
and the timings were a little bit off
unfortunately on this motherboard which
is the core is a h77 motherboard we
weren't allowed overclock and on that
note we weren't allowed to even touch
the memory timings so it was a little
bit confusing and it was something that
will of course give us a slight
detriment to performance when we're
playing games and also doing other tasks
that a memory reliant so hey guys let's
get back to the main question that we
hinted at in the intro and that was with
the computer and what happened
pacifically with this computer here and
one of the weirdest problems I've seen
and I have actually seen something
similar like this in the past but this
was specific to this Dell motherboard
and that is when we hooked it all up
everything was connected we went to fire
it up and essentially the PC wouldn't
boot up and now I did make the mistake
of just quickly putting this PC together
because I thought it would work and then
it didn't work when I first switched it
on it was ironic because I had my friend
here at the time and he saw it as well
we're like watching me trying to boot
this thing up I even recorded the first
boot and it just wouldn't turn on no
matter what I did
however after pulling it all apart again
I decided to do one thing and that is
just boot the PC up with everything
disconnected but the CPU bought the 24
pin even can disconnect the CPU 8 or 4
pin depending on your motherboard and
even take out all the RAM and it was at
that stage we got a little signal out of
it it changed it actually booted up in a
microsecond so I knew then we were
beginning to get somewhere so after this
point I changed the CMOS battery booted
it up again left the power off boot it
up again put one Ram stick in boot it up
again
we put the CPU 4 pin back in boot it up
again then that stage we got into the
BIOS and I knew things were starting to
look up for this PC and then we slowly
connected everything back up again one
piece by one piece and we put it in
legacy 2 UEFI mode and it was at this
stage we now had a working system that
was exactly the way we had it when we
originally
try to boot it up so none the wiser if
you guys are having problems with your
computer sometimes it's very beneficial
to just go back to the grassroots and
try to disconnect everything even the
RAM sticks and then try and boot it up
that's if you're getting absolutely
nothing out of it so this worked in this
case we now have this PC it's performing
really well and I'm sort of sort of
baffled as to exactly why this is when
it comes to this PC my putting it just
back to the bare bones booting one thing
at a time actually works I'd love to
read your comments in the comment
section below but what we had here at
the end of the day was a PC that's got
even new parts and is still incredible
value for money it's going to do a great
job for gaming and also since it's got
16 gigabytes of RAM it'll be able to do
1080p video editing even a bit of
streaming if you're into that thing for
280 US dollars anyway guys hope you
enjoyed today's build and also today's
diagnostics of problems because I had
another z68 motherboard ready right
beside that to transplant it into and
this was the last resort that I tried
I even tried as well another thing and I
don't know if this exactly worked or not
but I got some tweezers flat lined
tweezers and then I put them in and
cleaned out the sockets as well in
between and there was a little bit of
real Sony dust in one of the ddr3 RAM
slots so that could have been the
problem and I know this method has fixed
things in the past I'm not entirely sure
what made this motherboard boot up in
the end but it did get there and it is
really good so it does save me having to
transplant to another motherboard and
with that said I hope you guys enjoyed
today's video and if you did them sure
to hit that like button and again let me
know in the comment section below if
you've had any problem similar to this
and if you know exactly what was wrong
with this motherboard I'd love to hear
your thoughts and comments and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
