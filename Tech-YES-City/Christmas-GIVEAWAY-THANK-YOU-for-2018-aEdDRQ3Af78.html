channel I was forced to eat baked beans
and $1 spaghetti and 2018 things have
gotten a lot better but you know what
during that time I learned to appreciate
that $1 spaghetti welcome back to tech
US city and Merry Christmas everybody
for 2018 I hope you're all having a
wonderful day probably wondering
straight away while wearing this hat and
I thought just like the content that has
been coming out on the channel I thought
I'd change things up but honestly I
couldn't find a Christmas hat around the
house and this was the only hat that was
there so don't ask me why this hat is
lying around my house but anyway for
different prizes x3 992 motherboard from
asrock next up is a Corsair strafe RGB
MX silent keyboard with an Rx 574
gigabyte and we've also got a master
keys MK 750 keyboard with an Rx 472 and
we've got finally a gtx 1070 TI so all
you have to do to get in for a chance to
win is click on the link below and i'll
be announcing the winners on new year's
eve across all the different platforms
Facebook Twitter and Instagram so stay
tuned for that and best of luck
but also guys thank you so much for
watching the content in 2018 it's been a
great year for the channel wood built
the studio up I've been doing all these
different tests I hope you've been
enjoying the content and that's the main
thing if you haven't been let me know
why you haven't been enjoying the
content love reading your thoughts and
opinions as always but also on the desk
e I've been sent in some big presents
from either sponsors or companies that
I've collaborated with in 2018 so let's
open them up and see what we've got
so first up here we've got or ascending
in a bag and also a robot kind of like a
Gundam if you guys have know that old
Japanese anime thing so that's pretty
cool I'll put that together and see what
it looks like a bit later cuz I'm
terrible at building these things but
yeah this bag feels like it's really
good quality I know for instance the
last bag I got from MSI I'm still using
that to this date for events so these
bags I mean this one here feels like
it's really good quality and I'll
probably be switching it up and trying
out the Auris bag because it's got that
kind of pop G camo'd look to it
next up here from asrock they've sent
over a blanket which is actually really
good I put it on my couch where I
sometimes crash out if I'm really tired
I except I'm not gonna sleep there right
now to show you what the blanket looks
like if he's sleeping with it because
there's actually this huntsman spider is
huge he's been hanging around the last
couple of days and me and him have been
having a back-and-forth like I thought I
clipped him he lost the leg and then the
next night I see him around and he's
quick he was late knew I was coming so
he ran under the couch where he's
currently residing so I figured look
he's passed the gauntlet so if I find
him I kind of just want to let him
outside back into nature but I don't
know he is scary man I want to be sleep
in there and have him like hanging
around that is that ain't Frank that
ain't cool baby back on topic asrock
sent over a extended Mouse Matt feels
like it's really good quality they also
sent over another hat and I've actually
got a couple of hats here from them
already and this one's got an AMD logo
on a tube and this is going to be
another one in the collection of asrock
hats this is the Phantom gaming line and
then they sent over this shirt it's like
a mechanic should I guess kind of it
actually looks really cool because I've
never got a shirt with a collar on it in
the tech scene so I'm gonna put this one
on and see if it fits me nice and well
big thanks Azeroth I'm now officially a
walking advertisement for you guys but
they've also said over a card and they
said dear Brian with greetings of peace
and prosperity we are wishing you the
very best for you during this special
time may you enjoy all the best now and
throughout the coming year merry
Christmas from asrock also merry
Christmas to you guys at azrog they are
a channel sponsor here at tech yes City
and they've been really good to
collaborate with in the last year
especially I did do a negative review on
one of their motherboards and they sort
of took it pretty well so that was good
like I don't want to work with companies
that want me to change or pass up my
integrity for the sake of selling
product so it was good to see that
asrock have handled that pretty well and
honestly all their other products in
2018 have been very good we're taking a
look at the phantom gaming 6 very soon
which has passed all the tackiest tests
with flying colors so we've got a
present here from Nvidia RTX GeForce
it's I guess an ornament for your
Christmas tree not gonna lie I was
hoping I would have got a a nice RT X xx
atti in the mail better actually
speaking of in video I don't think I've
collaborated there with them at all in
2018 if I remember correctly like not
once this year I think the last time I
collaborated with in video was the 1070
Ti release so anyway thanks for the
present so all the best Merry Christmas
and video
next time here we've got presents from
another channel sponsor this is Corsair
and they've sent us over the coffee
beans which says our G beam or the RGB
with Corsair also sent us over a mug to
drink the coffee out of and also this
thing here which looks like you can
store the excess coffee in if you want
to drink it later and then we've got the
actual machine to make it I've got to
figure out how to still plug it up to an
Australian power point still looks a
little bit complicated but we'll figure
all that out guys don't worry in due
time they also sent us over cards that
did Brian warmest greetings and best
wishes for the new year from your
friends at Corsair and honestly corset
have just been absolutely amazing in
terms of collaborating with in 2018 I've
really liked some of their products
coming out especially lately the H 15i
platinum that cooler those fans are just
like completely whisper quiet we'll be
using them in a build very soon I mean
I'm actually changing things up on my
main rig just as a bit of an experiment
but in terms of Corsair I'm really
liking what they're doing I'll be
looking at some of their products at CES
as well so stay tuned for that
big thanks of course they have for
sponsoring out the channel this far and
I'm gonna go make some coffee very soon
and last up here we've got one from Oris
so if you guys thought asrock was going
hard with the ads then also taking a
next level and they've got a decoration
that lights up the nice orange logo with
the eagle and the Auris I'm not gonna
lie this thing's pretty cool like there
it is this so it's kind of like soft
tubing and yeah I really would love to
get something like this done in tech yes
City this doll and format looks wicked
so big thanks to orous for this one I'll
probably hang this up somewhere in the
studio thank you so much
