money a lot of people requested that I
do a top five graphics cards for the
money however since there is just so
many good news deals on graphics cards
out there I decided to do a top six and
even then that is not even going to do
enough justice
welcome back to tech yeah City this is
brian coming to you guys today with the
top six graphics cards for the first
half of 2016 now a lot of these cards
i'll give you guys some price points of
what you can pick them up for what you
can expect to pick them up for but a lot
of the times you'll have to get them on
free auction because a lot of people
will only be selling one card at a time
since they're used however with that
being said let's get on with number six
six coming in at sixth place is the 9800
GT now recently used one of these in my
70 dollar csgo potato and i thought it
was going to be a pretty bad graphics
card however it really surprised me
especially for a $10 gravis card this
card will do an absolutely fine job of
playing csgo League of Legends and even
dota 2 if you drop the settings down a
little bit so a great card for either
720p or entry real entry 1080p gaming
now you can expect to pay around about
10 to 15 dollars for one of these cards
used may be stretching it up to $20 but
I wouldn't pay any more than $20 for a
9800 GT by coming in at number 5 is the
HD 6970 and its little brother the HD 69
50 now these are great cards for the
money and they will still do a good job
of playing games at entry and medium
settings at 1080p depending on the game
now what I have here is a 2 gigabyte
variant that I picked up for around
about $70 so if you're lucky you'll pick
these cards up anywhere from 60 to 80
dollars now there are 1 gigabyte and 2
gigabyte variants you'll most likely
want to go for the 2 gigabyte variant if
you can if you get the one gigabyte
variant for a bargain don't be afraid to
play at 720p for a great price coming in
at number 4 is the HD 5870 and it's
little brother the HD 58 50 now what I
love about these cards is generally the
price point you can get them from around
about thirty to fifty dollars and they
will do a seriously good job of playing
games entry-level 1080p or even 720p
however most the time they come in one
gigabyte flavors so some games will
require more vram to be able to play
properly I was able to just get a fifty
eight fifty to play properly at 1080p
and GTA 5 which speaks great lengths for
a $30 card
three coming in at number three is the
gtx 660 now you can expect to pay
anywhere from around seventy to ninety
dollars for one of these I managed to
pick up two of these for around about
$80 each and honestly at $80 this is
offering very good performance for the
dollar especially since it's got a 2
gigabyte frame buffer on this'll be able
to play games perfectly fine at 1080p
and it also give you the added benefit
of using shadow play if you wish to and
also generally using a little bit less
power than the previous graphics cards
I've mentioned since it is a 28
nanometer variant coming in at number
two is the HD 7870 and it's little
brother the HD 7850 now these are
fantastic cards for the money they
generally come with a 2 gigabyte frame
buffer which will do a perfectly fine
job of playing games at 1080p
they also overclock really well and
generally you can pick them up for
around about eighty to a hundred dollars
so great value for money and number two
one coming in at number one is the HD
7970 you can also get the lower variant
the HD 7950 but these are fantastic
cards even to this day you'll be
expecting to pretty much max games out
at 1080p a lot of the time if not get
high settings this is a very capable
card even to this date and the best part
about it is it comes in at around about
130 to 150 dollars that's what you could
expect to pay for this the 79 50s you
can get them even a little bit cheaper
I'd be looking for one for around about
110 to 120 dollars so at this price you
can generally overclock them and there
will give you very good performance for
the dollar so anyway guys that's about
it for me today if you enjoyed this
video then please give it a big thumbs
up if you have any questions or comments
about this video then be sure to drop a
cone in the comment section below
before I get out here I will stress one
thing that is that this is used parts
we're dealing with so there's always the
risk of getting a broken part with no
warranty however you can avoid that by
generally checking out the seller and
confirming that the graphics card works
before you purchase it or if it does
have a problem at least confirm that you
could fix that problem before you buy it
anyway that's it from me I'll catch you
in the next Tech video very soon peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
