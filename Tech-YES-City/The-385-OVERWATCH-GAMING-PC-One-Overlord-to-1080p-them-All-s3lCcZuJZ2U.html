the weekend I took it upon myself not
only to play the games but also build a
whole Youth PC that would not only play
it but would kick its ass welcome back
to tokyo city this is bran coming to you
guys today with a custom PC that mixes
both use and new paths together and it
also will be able to play all the latest
titles at 1080p on pretty much high or
ultra this is the overwatch PC or the
overlord and it is going to kick ass at
1080p now as with all my used builds
I'll go over the price tally of these
parts and then I'll do the cleanse and
then the build and then the benchmarks
so let's get on with it
so it's time to start this thing up for
its maiden boot and I'm pretty sure I
hit the power button this time and I'm
pretty sure we'll get a signal
pretty sure nothing's gone up in Sparks
yet so good sign okay awesome
we're good to go
Oh
by second
No
you
so then we have it the benchmarks are in
and this thing is just simply phenomenal
it just minces games at 1080p now I like
my frame rates really high and this
thing was just simply able to deliver in
any of the titles I pushed it it even
overwatch at high settings at 1080p with
some fancy settings enabled this thing
was just absolutely destroying those
benchmarks then we had csgo this thing
was getting up near 300 frames on
average on dust2 on high settings at
1080p then we look at grey goo that
thing has a vsync limit there and that
was getting locked at 60 frames per
second pretty much so great frame rates
overall we also decided to throw in Call
of Duty 3 which is still a pretty
intensive title to this date and man
multiplayer maps absolutely no problems
we're getting way over 100 frames
average FPS there on high settings at
1080p now I could take this thing to
ultra but me personally I love gaming at
high settings because it gives me really
good frame rates for the visual
experience then we look at the
overclocks if you guys have followed me
a little bit you'll know that I tried
water cooling this PC on a different
case and with some different parts and
it kind of failed though the CP NS tend
to be cool that I got for $20 absolutely
did a phenomenal job of keeping that he
5640 cool at 4.2 gigahertz I was really
impressed with that overclock I was
getting around 80 degrees there on
average and that's a 4.2 gigahertz which
is a big overclock for this CPU since it
comes clocked in at 2.6 6 gigahertz now
the graphics card I did manage to get
that up to 1.2 gigahertz though it did
have a lot of instability and especially
even though I could get some benchmarks
done I managed to clock it in at one
point one gigahertz stable which is
still really damn good for a 79 70
considering that was the first iteration
of 28 nanometer cards from AMD and now
lastly I want to touch on the cosmetics
and the noise of this build I've got to
say for a $35 case I am very impressed
although it is a little bit cheap and
flimsy which is kind of expected for $35
it actually looks really good especially
for something so cheap now another thing
is when I posted this build up to
Twitter a lot of people were just
responding with damn that look
sexy and I was kind of surprised because
I didn't really pay any particular extra
attention to this build as I otherwise
were with another build if anything the
other builds would take me longer
because they've got more stuff in the
way this thing though it has great cable
management options there and it also has
that power supply at the bottom sealed
off with a full side acrylic panel there
which makes it really look good so that
we have it the three hundred and seventy
dollar overwatch PC is completely
kick-ass it's so kick-ass in fact that
I'm going to be giving it away to one
lucky subscriber so if you want more
information on how to win just check out

chance to win this thing for free and
