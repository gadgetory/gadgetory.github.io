get some LEDs behind your desk and it's
actually a lot easier process than I
thought it would be ladies and gentlemen
welcome back to tokyo city this is brian
coming to you guys today with a little
guide and how-to on how to get these
LEDs behind your desk and it's actually
a lot easier than I thought the whole
process probably takes twenty minutes
thirty minutes if you're slow so the
first thing you want to do is figure out
how much LED strips you'll need and now
on eBay there's literally a ton of
different sellers selling these LEDs 1
meter 2 meter 3 meter 4 meter 5 meter 10
meter 100 meters 1000 meter I said I
think is it a 1000 meter strip out also
you have the option there of getting it
with the charger which is exactly what I
did and I also opted for a 5 meter strip
now there's different colors there
they've got red blue green black actual
I don't think they have black and then
once you get the LEDs in it's pretty
much a simple case of just rolling them
on the round the desk since they come
with some adhesive tape on the back they
keep in mind though once you get this
tape on there it is pretty light so you
may wish to use some additional adhesive
in my case I just taped the ends of the
LEDs off where you can't see them and
now also another good thing is that this
process is very cheap as well I managed
to speak of a 5 meter strip with a
charger for lit for 25 Australian
dollars which is cheaper in US as well I
think it's like 20 US dollars so very
cheap to get this all set up and also
you have the option they're getting
waterproof and whatnot if you need to
also keep in mind though there are
different types of LEDs there's the 30
30s which aren't that bright and then
there's the 56 30s now the 56 30s are
probably the ones you will want to go
with as they're very bright and they do
a good job so that's about it guys it's
a very easy process all you will need if
you get the charger option is a
screwdriver and maybe a pair of scissors
just to take off a bit more plastic off
the wires so it's very easy to do again
it took me like 20 minutes I think
anyone can do this and it's very
hassle-free
again just looks pretty cool I guess it
adds a different touch to your room and
in my case it's going to add a different
thing to my backdrops it's going to give
it that bitter mmm kind of like Austin
