announced with the release date set for
october 25th and the 1050 comes in at a
hundred and nine dollars and the 1050 TI
coming in at a hundred and thirty nine
dollars though what is this spell for
the entry-level PC gaming market let's
take a look welcome to tech city this is
brian coming to you guys today with a
discussion on the gtx 1050 and 1050 TI
now getting straight into the chase here
the 1050 is coming in with 640 cuda
cores sporting a clock speed of fourteen
hundred and fifty five megahertz now it
does have a two gigabyte frame buffer
and i know a lot of people are going to
be concerned about this they want to see
it some mainstream titles at 1080p like
overwatch or water warcraft for instance
this game should be plenty enough to
play those titles and at $109 honestly
it is going to hit pretty hard for the
entry-level market the one thing that
does concern me is that pricing is it
going to stick to $109 straight off the
get-go as we've seen in previous
launches of the graphics cards they have
come over retail pricing so that is a
little bit of a concern there and then
moving on to the 1050 Ti we have 768
cuda cores with a clock speed of
thirteen hundred and ninety two
megahertz though this time around this
does have a 4 gigabyte frame buffer
which is kind of interesting considering
the GTX 1060 only has a three gigabyte
buffer that's the entry-level 1060 as
opposed to the 6 gigabyte 1060 and that
card comes in at $200 so it's
interesting where they place the 1050 Ti
though NVIDIA has said that the clock
speeds should be able to go up to around
1.9 gigahertz possibly even more the one
thing that probably concerned people is
the memory bus at 128 bits wide they're
going to be a problem for the 1050 Ti
and actually don't think it will be
considering the GTX 1060 the six key
wave version has only 192 there and that
didn't really have any problems in
regards to gaming so I don't think the
1050 GI should come in to any
performance issues due to that 128 bit
wide boss there on the memory which
means that both these graphics cards
will be substantially better than their
predecessors both the 750 Ti and the 950
another good thing is that it doesn't
have a power connector onboard which
means it'll use up to 75 watts meaning
that you can just put it on a
motherboard from the PCA and it'll draw
power straight from there so in other
words you can chuck it in one of those
om desktop PCs off eBay that you can
pick up for cheap or wherever you can
pick it from plug it in and you should
have a pretty decent gaming PC for the
money though another thing I wanted to
talk about is what this is gonna spell
for the market in general hopefully we
can see that rx 470 come down to the
hundred and $49 price point with a foggy
buy a frame buffer and some kickass
performance and a hundred and forty nine
dollars that card would absolutely kick
ass now I recently reviewed the rx 460
and it was a little bit better than the
750 Ti though it was competing with the
950 so I think the RX 460 is kind of
gonna get left behind by the 1050 in the
1050 Ti which is unfortunate for AMD
though if they do bring the price down
of the RX 470 then it could be an
awesome thing for the market in general
and me personally I would love to pick
up an rx 470 especially in a used meets
new build and what I could do with that
for price performance it would be
incredible
also some Augmented things with this
graphics card is you won't be out of SLI
them or at least not to my knowledge so
don't expect to go out and buy two of
them and get double the performance
because that's just not going to be
happening also if you're already on a
gtx 960 4 gigabyte for example then
don't really expect to upgrade and get
better performance because that grabs
card is gonna be similar in performance
to the 1050 Ti in my opinion so it's
really not going to be an upgrade path
for a lot of people who have sort of
those mid-range cards from the previous
generations of graphics cards anyway
guys if you liked this video then please
hit that like button also let me know in
the comment section below are you going
to be going out and getting a gtx 1050
or 1050 TI or if not do you think this
card is gonna shake off the market a
little bit we'd love to hear your
thoughts and opinions and I'll catch you
in the next Tech video very soon peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
