this 980ti gravis cot has been released
into the wild it was released on June
2nd in 2015 came in with an MSRP of 650
us and three years later we still have
the 10 70s and 10 series 1080 T eyes and
cards that I've kind of stagnated in
terms of GPU development though that's
probably soon to change with either the
11 or the 20 series cut but regardless I
picked this card up for quite a bargain
under 300 u.s. I got it for 350
Australian dollars so I do recommend if
these cards are cheap enough you might
want to get one because today we're
gonna be cleaning this card up we're
gonna be giving us some tech yes loving
and we're gonna be comparing it against
the 1070 TI now it's a little bit
different because we're gonna be putting
it in my favorite setup of all time X 58
I'm gonna be using the six core i7 980 X
now you're probably wondering damn these
chips are expensive and yes they are
I do recommend getting the xeon variants
that's the X 56 60s or X 56 70s or my
favorite the X 56 75 for a lot cheaper
than this but since I did get this for
basically nothing with GTX 690 s that I
picked up in a previous used parts deal
if you want to check that out I'll put
it up here I'm gonna use it today and of
course put this 980ti to the test and
see how it does fare against that brand
new 1070 TI that was released late last
year and came in with an MSRP of 449 but
of course the mining and the crypto boom
made it more expensive but lately it's
calmed down in price so you may be able
to pick them up near retail but
regardless let's see how this user price
performance compares
welcome back to tech yes City and of
course we've got the gravis card here
does need a bit of a touch up of course
we're gonna give it a bit of break clean
up a bit of an alcohol wiping down to
get rid of that thermal paste and also
some wd-40 and now my new favorite
thermal paste the gel it GC extreme so
let's get on to essentially restoring
this and giving this graphics card some
tech yes lovin
so there's a graphics card there it is
looking beautiful but we've also got the
cooler this is cooler masters 620 P
cooler now for some reason I don't know
why this thing is not available in the
US because it it's actually very solid
value for money but also looks really
cool too it's got that RGB bling two
fans massive and it does most
importantly do a good job of cooling
down your CPU so with all that aside
let's put this rig together and see what
we've got on our hands after we finish
it off
so now this PC is complete we haven't
fired it up just yet but what we've
gotten here is two brand new drives 120
gigabyte SSD and also a one terabyte
hard drive from Seagate
putting new drives in a build is always
one way to make it very contemporary
make it very fast because in this case
your old drives could slow down and they
could be actually a detriment to this
old x58 motherboard here now the x58
motherboard with ddr3 memory and a 6
quart 12 threaded CPU this thing just
performs really well I've recently
tested down the video comparing it even
against the 8700 K with a 1080i and it
did really well so now we've got the
980ti in here also this deal hunted PC
case and 1200 watt pounds black and of
course with these brand new cooler
master cooler which does take the CPU up
to four point five gigahertz let's fire
this thing up now and see how to perform
and some of the latest and greatest time
so it's now the morning after and I
finished benchmarking the 980ti versus
the 1070 TI and really in games there
isn't a whole lot of difference I mean
we pull up GTA 5 here 1440p very high
settings also turned on anti-aliasing
and there's only really a few frames
difference in this game Final Fantasy 15
as well this was a game that the 1070 I
did score a victory in but it was a
little bit better on the 0.1% lows - in
this game then we move over to pub G at
1440p again not a whole lot of a
difference in the frame rates and then
the last game Kingdom Come deliverance
again only a few frames so this card
here if you can pick it up on a bargain
especially for what I got at 4 which was
350 Australian dollars which is like 280
USD that it's a very good buyers coming
in a lot cheaper than a 10-7 TTI but it
is performing virtually the same of
course power consumption was a little
bit high we're scoring five hundred and
sixty watts from the wall with this
whole configuration with the i7 980 X
overclocked and the gtx 980ti
overclocked versus the 1070 TI
overclocked with the same cpu we're
getting 491 so there was a difference of
70 watts from the wall when they'll both
overclocked and also the interesting
thing is I decided to test the i79 ATX
overclocked and then non overclocked as
well as the GPU non overclocked and the
difference was 450 watts versus five
hundred and sixty watts so we're using
up 110 watts extra with the 980 TI and
the CPU overclocked and that was about
an extra twenty five percent performance
boost on the CPU side of things and the
GPU side we got an extra 10 percent out
of that as well the idle power
consumption figures were also pretty
interesting as well
135 watts idle versus a hundred and 85
watts idle so the x58 when you do
overclock it it does ramp up those idle
power consumption figures but of course
when it all comes down to what the 980
TI is still a fantastic Buy three years
later and it's still performing really
well of 1440p if you drop the settings
down too high you'll get an even
smoother experience
and some of the games I didn't see
anywhere near the six gigabytes the vram
buffer I think pub G we've got four
point two gigabytes of usage Kingdom
Come deliverance 2.6 gigabytes
GTA 5 I saw it go up to a three point
nine gigabytes and then Final Fantasy 15
was 3.8 gigabytes so we still got a
little bit of room left in the tank with
the 980ti of course the 1078 does have 8
gigabytes so it would be considered a
little bit more future-proof but as I've
argued in the past when you start
utilizing more vram the frames drop
anyway because the GPU itself is
generally having to work harder than it
otherwise would if you weren't putting
those taxing settings on that usually
use up a lot of vram and also stress the
GPU itself also one cool little thing
about the PC behind me was that when we
changed from the X 56 75 which I did a
recent video on we've got that to 4.5
gigahertz now the exact same settings in
the BIOS because it remembers those
settings when I put the i7 980 X in I
could only get out to 4.4 gigahertz at
those same settings so perhaps there is
a little bit of truth behind those eons
being better bins even to the i7 like
best counterpart which was the 980 X of
course it is only one sample versus one
sample but from what I hear from a lot
of other people who have those X 56 75
Zeon's they do do a really good job when
it comes to overclocking also before I
get on out of here as well the
temperatures in this case were
phenomenal so the actual airflow of the
case itself is really good especially
for an older-style case we've got a
push-pull configuration of course it is
a little bit loud you can probably hear
it when it's switched on now that it is
quite loud but there's also some inserts
in the side panel that allow the GPU to
suck in air as well and breathe so it's
a really cool design and we saw this
with the GPU temperatures the 980ti
scored practically a max of 60 degrees
even when overclocked and this is a
power-hungry card this isn't the most
massive solution I've seen either the
1070 TI as well that was scoring
phenomenally well even when overclocked
and that's both of these have had that
GC gel at extreme experience too for the
thermal paste but here guys let me know
in the comment section below which do
you think is a better buy at the moment
a 10-7 ati or a 980ti don't forget to
hit that like button then I'll catch an
another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
