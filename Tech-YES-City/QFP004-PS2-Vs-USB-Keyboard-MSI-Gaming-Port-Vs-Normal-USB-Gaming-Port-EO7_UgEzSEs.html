Asbury Ronnie's coming back to you guys
today with episode 4 of quest for
perfection and this time I am testing
keyboards because you guys requested in
the last episode for me to test
keyboards test response times and also
test PST versus USB and which has the
better response times so I did that
today and I did the methodology I used
was a little bit weird because I
couldn't find a program specifically for
testing keyboard response times so what
I did was I took matters into my own
hands
I got a reaction test off the web and
then I used it with the Enter key and I
pitted this first candidate we had here
was and I did it a hundred times so I
tested it a hundred times to weed out
any inaccuracies I mean even though
there will be inaccuracies I still
waited out as much as I could by testing
it a hundred times the first candidate
here is the Microsoft economic natural
keyboard now this is a standard deal
it's 125 Hertz polling or 8 milliseconds
response time and I tested this with
MSI's gaming USB port versus the normal
USB port so this is basically a test to
find out if MSI's gaming port lives up
to its hype the next test I did more
specifically was the this keyboard has
the option with a ps2 adapter so I could
test more pacifically USB versus ps2 so
this was great this was a keyboard that
was great for doing that and in the
process of testing these two keyboards
actually found out expected and I'll get
to that at the end of the video but
let's get onto the results here the
first was the gaming port versus the
normal port now I did a hundred tests
and you know I did it without any bias I
just looked wait for the green light
bang wait for the green light bang so
and as we see here the gaming port was
actually the first port that I tested
and I averaged 252 milliseconds over a
hundred tests the next time I did it the
normal port was 257 so this makes me
believe that the MSI gaming port is
legit it actually does work so it does
provide a benefit so if you guys have a
normal keyboard or a normal Mouse you
can get that extra eight or so
milliseconds out of the gaming port
which is actually really good I'm
impressed with MSI that they actually
give it they deliver a product that
works the next part here is the ps2
versus the USB
so this is another again a hundred tests
and what I found here like this is again
variants so USB on the gaming port it
averaged 232 milliseconds over 100 tests
this is on my mechanical blues and the
ps2 average 234 milliseconds so again
what I've concluded here now is
basically that USB at one millisecond or
a hunt a thousand Hertz poling versus
pierced - there really is no difference
at best one millisecond because in my
vent in my tests here it didn't really
make a difference what did make a
difference though as you could see here
the 234 versus say the 252 there was a
16 millisecond difference between
keyboards and now what this has to do
and this is my conclusion is that
basically the actuation point on the
keyboard is more important than the
actual ps2 versus the usb itself so with
my with my mechanical keyboard the
actuation point is pretty high so as I
click the key it actuates faster than
the rubber domes do on the ergonomic and
the ergonomic when I press it down
basically it's only actuated when I
fully press it down so if you guys are
gamers you will want a keyboard that has
really high actuation points so I
believe that cherry MX Reds are possibly
the best then in conclusion however it
will matter will it will differ from
manufacturer to manufacturer I will say
that my cherry MX blues are my game is
my gaming keyboard at the moment so this
is my gaming keyboard and it does
provide a benefit over my Microsoft
economic keyboard however mark Microsoft
economic keyboard is still a really
insanely good keyboard for you know just
typing when I gotta type a lot of you
know words out it's an it's a
phenomenally good keyboard and actually
really is good for your wrist so I do
recommend economic keyboards if you guys
are working on your computers a lot in
conclusion I will say yes so the
actuation points are more important than
the USB versus the ps2 this is my
conclusion this is my results I hope you
guys enjoyed this please let me know in
the comment section below what the next
episode would be what would you what
would you guys like me to test and what
would you like me to see and
so I'm gonna say now is that yeah check
your city has the passion baby I'm gonna
go listen to some Billy Joel we didn't
start the fire
I'm gonna get my stereo cranked you know
going back to the 80s I love Eddie's
music so I guess I would appreciate a
thumbs up and if you haven't already
subscribed a techie city where this
place is just gonna keep on growing oh
yeah you guys piss off an app or an easy
way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
