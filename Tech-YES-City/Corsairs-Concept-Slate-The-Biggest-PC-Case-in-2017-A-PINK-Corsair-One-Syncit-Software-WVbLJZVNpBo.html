and I have this massive case beside me
now I'm joined by Chris Smith email from
Australia Corsair how you doing man a
pretty good Brian how about you - really
good I was just thinking with this thing
what can we fit inside it well besides
probably fitting a few small animals or
maybe maybe children if you if you
really want
we've got 34 fans inside the concept
slate here we've got two full systems as
well so we have up to e ATX and also an
MIT X they running on completely
different loops here - you've got a tray
on the back for all the SSDs and then
all of these fans feed on two trays here
as well tempered glass all over and of
course it's coarse there so there's RGB
okay so there's RGB tempered glass this
thing looks like it would weigh a
mammoth amount how many kilograms does
this weigh things about twenty kilos dry
so if no products inside are whatsoever
about twenty kilograms when you ship it
in a box the side panels come off and
they ship in their own little boxes
inside the box as well so wow that's a
lot of weight guys so if you had your
gym membership and you got this thing
you would no longer need a gym
membership as this will it definitely do
your workout right yeah exactly I mean
if you if you go onto land parties who
said the Nerds unfit right so there you
go men in Mother Russia so looking at
the rear of the slate you can open up
the trees and that'll allow you now to
mount up to eight SSDs and also further
five hard drives now there is a lot of
cable management back here to work with
and you can also mount this small
form-factor power supply for the mini
ITX system down here and also further
mount the ATX power supply next to that
inside so huge amount of room and of
course it is very fancy and also over at
the Corsair booth they have a really
cool concept case which was designed
from the Corsair Bulldog which I took a
look at on the channel and they've
managed to turn it into an old-school
GTO car with a custom paint job and it's
actually really cool because I think it
has like indicator lights and stuff on
the back which actually turn on - and
then in another room in the Corsair
booth they have their gaming chairs
which they have the or
black version which I must say looks
very sleek and was very comfortable also
besides that was a complete teardown of
the Corsair 1 and then besides that was
a pink custom version of the Corsair 1
so if you guys know any gaming girl
chicks we like these kinds of things and
they want to see this released to market
rather than just be a concept then let
us know in the comment section below but
another really interesting thing at the
booth was the ability to overclock ddr4
vengence memory I believe on air some of
this memory went up to 4600 which was a
crazy overclock and then on another
board they still managed to get again
over 4,000 megahertz this was on the new
Intel X 299 motherboard chipset lineup
so now another really cool feature of
the Corsair booth is their sync its
software and this is essentially
combining the queue and the linkage
software together and revolutionising
the way also supports sa revolutionising
the way you use RGB and now they did
show me a really cool demo where they
have the keyboard the mouse the mouse
pad and the case with RGB strips hooked
up to this software and the demo was
extremely impressive there was just
lighting effects going through in sync
through the whole case there was a
number of different effects you could
choose from with a number of different
features so I'm really looking forward
to trying this in real life and seeing
how it works and seeing if you can also
hook up to different cool effects like
your health bars and stuff that was sent
at other booths so if you guys will fans
with the spec alpha there now refreshing
this and giving it a revamp and calling
it the spec o4 you've also got the color
choice of red yellow or gray and there's
also a perspex window so giving you the
ability to view your parts on a budget
and also the Corsair booth is the
concept curve and now they are using a
carbon fiber body here and a tempered
glass side panel so this one is a really
early concept they are fitting all their
custom water blocks and water fittings
in here however I don't know any terms
of pricing and availability at all with
this and I believe they're just testing
this one to market so let us know in the
comments if you think the concept curve
is good on
looking at some water fittings so of
course there are going to be entering
the custom water cooling market and
they've got custom water blocks and
custom water blocks for your CPU so I
believe they are teaming up with aqua
computer for the blocks and then they
are going to introduce their own
fittings and custom place in-house so
you will see some really cool custom
water cooling coming out of course
they're also on the radiators they are
refreshing the corsair hydra series so
now they're coming out with also a 360
mil rad with magnetic levitation or fans
and also besides that the pump is
getting a refresh and it's a new pump
that's quieter and you still get the 5
year warranty on these coolers so i'm
now done with the first part of the
course their booth they have a pretty
big booth here so i will also be
covering some really cool products on
their peripheral line i believe they
have this concept loose coming out so
stay tuned for that
and i'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
