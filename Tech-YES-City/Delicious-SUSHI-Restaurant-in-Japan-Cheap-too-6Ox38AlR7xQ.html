you'd say automated so you can either
sit at the counter and that's good if
you just want to quickly come in grab
your sushi and get out or like us today
we're gonna sit down at the table oh
yeah so this place is actually pretty
busy so this is like a chain store kind
of like mmm like I guess the black
McDonald's of franchise so it's all
across Japan I think and we're gonna put
little B band down yep he wants to have
some sushi too but he's not he's not old
enough yet so but yeah guys here is the
menu
okay so basically first off you get into
the menu and you order your sushi which
is pretty sad I mean I do like ordering
off a person as it else keep someone
employed but anyway you got lots of
sushi to choose from here guys and you
got drinks and dessert
so which what do you want so you grab a
miso soup so my wife will order a miso
soup and I'm gonna order some my
favorites and an onion with mayonnaise
I'll show you that order fun here it is
guys
salmon onion no onions salmon say you
want to so we're gonna get fours I want
to as well and says you got the option
here of choosing wasabi or no wasabi
we're gonna go with a bit of a sub a
little bit take a little bit man yeah a
little bit of a Survey's okay here we go
yeah so there we go guys we are gonna
get our first order and show you what
it's like you guys so you basically get
complimentary green tea as well and
complementary ginger put on their sushi
and people retreat soy sauce and Carol
anyway guys we're gonna show you look at
the menu here so we get more vegetable
we get more yeah they got a big variety
associated choose from so basically
there's 12 pages
you guys can pause the frames unlike
this one here but I'll show you guys
everything they've got and this one I
like to a lot of stops really and that
one makes it sold out so that it got no
more
so they've also got little special
dishes too and you can choose guns so
yeah that's all the pages we go through
now there's also dessert as well dessert
and drinks so you can choose from a
wider range of dessert and drinks
okay guys so here's the Abby avocado
which is basically shrimp and avocado
and onion and here is my salmon onion
and mayo after I don't behaviour ginger
but all that ginger is gonna last me for
all my sushi sir basically guys a plate
of sushi here will cost you 105 yen on a
Saturday and Sunday and 90 yen on a
weekday so it's really cheap that's
about a dollar 20 and yeah a dollar 20
so $1 24 a play decision and it tastes
awesome so it's route if you order it
from the machine so if you order from
the machine guys it's really fresh but
if you grab it off the train and on the
lease so fresh
now my wife got a Miso's suit but she
pretty much demolished it as soon as it
got here so basically anything in a bowl
will cost you 150 yen okay so this is
one of my favorites is called the Chawan
mushi now what it is is basically a bit
of sort of just like egg and sort of
scrambled egg kind of thing like but not
scrambled I guess with some mushroom and
taco which is buy at bamboo now this is
my next one here this is the broccoli
shrimp and avocado salad I think so this
is again this is about a dollar fifty
getting 150 yen or dollars eighty
something and this one as well it's 150
yen so never go do it yeah prove old you
a delicious delicious and my wife going
to delicious and little B men won't see
you won't stay too delicious
delicious delicious delicious
okay the next order is tuna avocado ship
that's a ship it's like a boat guys it's
like it's gonna go in my mouth and we've
also got another order coming here it is
guys so this is my year as well so this
is like a Japanese fish called a knuckle
and you basically put this sauce on yeah
you put sweet sauce like I don't
actually know the name for it never
bothered learning it so you put your
sauce on like that and it tastes really
good guys that is my final bit of food
that I'm gonna eat and basically yeah I
could eat anything with avocado I'm an
avocado lover love avocado
lots of sushi for everybody
see you guys they got a lot and yeah you
can basically you don't know what the
sushi looks like or you want to get an
idea or you can just let it roll by have
a look and then you know you can't
really you can't try before you buy
though unfortunately you can't look
before you buy that's a good thing and
when you're done you just hit this
button here the KK button and you get
your some girl comes over and counts how
many plates you've got and then you just
get the bill and you pay for it easy uh
okay guys we've finished up now and all
that for two people came to San Yan
Kakaako juuhachi n which is about $18
guys so if $18 you get really good
tasting sushi it's fresh and that's
about it
