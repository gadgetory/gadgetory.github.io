saying that number but here it is a ox
egg on AG 2 5 1 FC monitor which is a
1080p TN panel at 25 inches so if you
guys were like me before seeing this
thing thinking oh it's only a 1080p TN
then damn just like me I am here to tell
you this thing is just pure motion and
what it lacks for in picture quality it
certainly makes up for and then some in
everything else and it is a very worthy
monitor even for someone with the latest
and greatest so let's find out why and
welcome back to tech city and this is
the yes-man Brian coming to you guys
today with a Ock's hard-hitting 25 inch
monitor which has exceptional response
times
honestly the sharpest I have ever seen
in my life I didn't even see any
ghosting with overdrive features turned
to even strong however at this setting
there was some very slight overshoot
though the picture was just so sharp at
this setting the medium setting was also
quite sharp and was pretty comfortable
for gaming and offered a great balance
the other two settings low and off did
feel slightly blurry suggesting that the
response times were too slow for 240
Hertz so I'd recommend either the medium
or strong settings may be strong for
competition and medium for RPGs the
input lag was also phenomenal and the
monitor had a low input lag mode which
when turned on presented some really
solid numbers beating out the Korean
actor on vision monitor here I have by
quite a bit though a lot of monitors
that come through here seem to beat this
out so I'm just going to say that it's
got really good input lag now onto the
240 Hertz part this is a monitor that
essentially refreshes 240 times a second
vertically and as soon as you dial in
the proper refresh rate that's when it
kicks in the butter the fluidity the oh
my god this is real you can even notice
it with the mouse cursor and windows
straightaway I've never had the
experience of such a smooth picture like
this in my life this was completely
gorgeous the motion that is the TN 1080p
picture of course doesn't compare with
high res ipsa annals but it was still
quite decent for a 10 panel but of
course it was the extremely smooth
picture and lightning fast response
times and
input lag that make gaming on this thing
especially in competitive titles a
breeze games like csgo dota 2 and
overwatch will really benefit from a
monitor like this I mean I was standing
up and playing on an unfamiliar Mouse
and was just straight fragging I mean I
thought 100 Hertz 34-inch Sammy was good
and it is amazing but the a off to 40
Hertz this certainly has its own niche
though besides the 1080p TN panel there
is another caveat to this computer and
that is your gear to produce 240 FPS it
wasn't such a problem for me being on a
7700 K overclocked to 5 gigahertz though
keep in mind if you do get this monitor
that you will need both a demanding CPU
and a demanding GPU with the demanding
CPU part becoming probably more so than
ever the most important it has ever been
so don't ignore the fact that you will
need an expensive set of hardware to run
this monitor properly so if you can run
it properly then it will give you
something that I'm sure your mortal eyes
have never experienced before however
there was something odd with this
monitor at 60 Hertz and even 120 Hertz
this monitor exhibited some noticeable
cross-hatching but at 240 Hertz it
looked really nice and the picture was
smooth as silk
and honestly I have no problem with this
since this is how the monitor should be
run also this setting with quite high
brightness at 90% the monitor only
managed to juice 20 watts from the wall
which is very good for a monitor that
refreshes four times faster than any
standard 1080p monitor out there the OSD
is also very intricate and features
different color settings you can change
and also features different modes so I
found all the modes to put out a picture
that I personally I wasn't comfortable
using as it made the picture look very
off in all other instances but the
default setting there were extra
features like 4 levels of low blue light
mode a bright frame enhancement setting
and also eco in different languages too
so the OSD is definitely feature packed
and you can even control it with the
included commander and also on that note
the font and buttons were also so big
that even dad man no longer needed his
magnifying glass to read the text on it
the monitor includes the DisplayPort
cable power brick stand and vase and
mounting capable kit the included stand
is also brilliant having slow
tilt height and rotation adjustment and
they are all quite generous to the
aesthetics of this monitor are a thin
matte black bezel and matte silver paint
finish for the stand which is also made
of alloy on the rear you get the option
to connect hdmi 2.0 HDMI 1.4 DVI VGA and
display point 1.2 a with only hdmi 2.0
and DisplayPort having the capability
for 240 Hertz there is also support for
free sync from 48 Hertz to 240 Hertz so
AMD graphics card users should be quite
pleased as well also for data
connectivity you get four USB ports with
one of those being a charge port for
something like a smart phone now the
monitor does also come with speakers
built-in though if you are running the
monitors through the display port HDMI
cable then the included speakers can
produce quite a tinny sound that is okay
if you don't have speakers but I'd
recommend some decent headphones or a
decent 2.1 setup which can be run from
the monitor itself and did sound okay on
my v-moda headphones whilst playing
guardians of the galaxy volume 2
soundtrack
there is also an included headphone
stand on the side as the picture quality
brightness uniformity was quite good to
my eyes it wasn't perfect but there was
nothing that was noticeable on the
desktop or thereafter there was also no
backlight bleeding coming through either
so now its conclusion time in the a Ock
Aegon AG 2 v 1 FC comes in at 599
Australian dollars it is available in
the US as well as the UK though I could
only find it for 550 us and 394 pounds
respectively which makes it more
expensive than what it is in Australia
probably one of those few rare instances
and of course there's that final
question of is it worth it and frankly
in my opinion yes yes yes yes I love
this monitor and the fluidity of the
picture it provides sure the picture
quality itself is far from being the
best I've seen on a monitor in fact it's
mediocre at best with the 1080p TN but
where this monitor shines is that 240
Hertz and competitive gamers at their
peak or people who love high fps and
smooth motion will really appreciate
this monitor I honestly thought that I'd
come into this review not noticing the
difference but the reality is the
difference was there and you can feel it
straightaway as soon as you
even change the refresh rate in Windows
not to mention gains with just a smooth
stream of liquid running through the
monitor so it might just be that my eyes
can see motion better than other
reviewers and/or gamers so if you work
in on this monitor and you don't know if
it's for you or not then I'd recommend
demoing it at a computer store if you
can or if you want a chance to win one
of these monitors for absolutely nothing
then I'll put a link up here or in the
description below where you can enter
for a chance to win one of these two
monitors internationally so Steve from
hardware unbox and I we're teaming up to
give away two of these monitors
internationally for absolutely nothing
so check out the description below link
will be in there you can get more
details and enter anyway guys if you
enjoyed today's videos and be sure to
hit that like button and let me know in
the comments section below
do you prefer higher refresh rates at
the cost of low picture quality or do
you prefer higher resolution and better
panels in terms of picture quality with
lower refresh rates would love to hear
your thoughts and opinions in the
comment section below and I'll catch you
guys in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
