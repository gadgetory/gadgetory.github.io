for you guys where I'm talking about the
direction of takia city and the input
that you guys have on it and where we go
from here
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
check yes City this is brad coming back
to you guys today with some gameplay
commentary over a game called
Wolfenstein the new order however this
game won't be the main topic for today
the main topic will be takia city and
sponsorships now a while ago i did make
a video where I was kind of against
taking sponsorships as I believed they
would affect my opinions and I do never
want to be known as a shill right
basically with my whole video and my
whole channel in general is that it's
always honest reviews and for what it's
worth it is going to stay that way
forever more I never want to be known as
a shill and I just hate the thought of
selling people garbage and then
packaging it is something that's good
i'm really against that and that's not
going to change however when i made that
video a while ago a lot of people
suggested in the comments that i should
be open to taking sponsorships as long
as it doesn't affect my freedom of
speech and this being my this being in
mind or keeping this in mind I did
decide that recently when a website
gearbest calm reached out to me to
review a smartphone or to review
anything on their website I took it upon
me to say that yes i will give your
website some exposure and that will be
in an upcoming review on the pretense
that I review the phone for them and so
this is a great opportunity for me to
get products to review for you guys and
since I haven't signed any agreements or
any contracts or anything like that I
can still give you guys the usual
reviews that you used to and that's just
completely honest reviews so I decided
to take this stance and I decided to
open up the channel a little bit more
towards this and if you guys are
honestly have anything against that or
if you have any extra feedback I'd love
to hear it in the comments below as
ultimately I love your feedback and
opinions and this is the reason why I do
the videos that I do is just it's pretty
much all for you guys and for educating
myself as well so I love how the
channels gone so far and i love the
direction that it's going to take and
the fact that has grown this fire has
just been
a shock to me I never thought when I did
that first video years and years ago on
a razer mouse that i would gain a
following and i would be making videos
to this day i never thought it was
possible but as it takes it passion has
brought me this far and passion will
keep me going however that being said I
do like to be rewarded for my time since
making decent content does take a lot of
time and so this is in this sense it's
not a monetary incentive but I do get a
free product in turn for exposing the
retailer and the good thing about this
is that the retailer is not the person
making the product so the retailer will
get some exposure for their website and
that being said it was a pretty decent
website they dummy the turnaround
they've got me a product shipped
internationally within five days so that
was pretty good in itself and so I will
be reviewing this smartphone in the next
coming pal next coming week for you guys
to stay tuned for that and it will be as
usual just a completely open and honest
review so that's just basically the main
grid of this video I wanted to make sure
that you guys didn't have anything
against this and if you did I'd love to
hear your thoughts and opinions and a
lot of people as well have been telling
me that I should start taking Takeo city
oasis start approaching this channel
more like a business which is a great
thing to do and i will start treating
this channel with more a lot more
professionalism even though lately I
feel that I have been treating this
channel with a high degree of
professionalism so that being said
things are just going to continue the
way they are except there will be some
sort of a in unit inserts into the
videos when that when it's called for so
and another topic I wanted to touch on
was review samples in general now there
seems to be this stigma out there that a
lot of people will just give products
good reviews because they got these
samples for free and now this might be
the case for a lot of other check
channels I'm not too sure on how they do
that business but for me it's definitely
not the case when I get sent a product I
review it on its own merit and now in
the past I have been sent product review
samples and I
given them bad or terrible reviews
suffice to say the manufacturers never
contacted me again but that's not my
concern at the end of the day I sleep
like a baby at night and nothing's gonna
change in that regard I assure you that
now another thing I did want to touch on
to his tech gaming weekly with Joker man
Joker we recently will actually you know
prove what 15 weeks ago we decided to
start doing a tech show for you guys
called tech gaming weekly and now the
reason for this is just a lot of people
were requesting me to have a co-host for
my regular Tech Talk series and when I
collaborated with Joker we hit it off
really well I mean both on cam and off
cam we're both he's a great guy in
person he's a friendly guy and one thing
about him is he is very strong-minded
and strong-willed and that's something
that I respect about him even if we
disagree on topics I respect him for
being strong like that and that being
said that's not going to change anything
to do with tech yes city my channel is
my channel and his channel is his
channel and that's the way it's going to
stay simply because that's just how it
is I mean check gaming weekly is
essentially an independent show that's
not related to my channel or Joker's
channel in that he's gonna start making
me say this and this about a product or
a vice versa so that's something with
tech gave me weekly you guys don't have
to worry about anything changing around
here because I know there are a few of
you guys who have pointed out that you
don't like Joker and that's fine with me
that's each to their own you guys are
perfectly entitled to have that opinion
that's something that I love about
everyone being an individual so one
thing I wanted to show you guys is that
nothing's going to change with the
actual channel that I'm running here so
don't worry about that and yeah that's
about all I wanted to touch on with you
guys and that being said me and jerk
will be keeping the tech gaming weekly
show continuing as I believe we're just
having a lot of fun I mean I honestly
enjoy it even if I look don't all right
look really tired or I don't look like
I'm having fun I actually enjoy
collaborating with Joker a lot and
honestly we help each other a lot
and thus far Joker's actually helped me
a lot more than I've helped him for
instance recently he just sent me a
product that I was able to get for
really cheap in the States he posted
that over to me in Japan and he didn't
charge anything for that as well as the
fact that he also has recently given me
a Windows 8.1 pro key for free as well
so joke has done a lot of good by me and
I mean at the end of the day everyone
can have their opinions about him but I
know that he's a good guy with a good
heart and that's all that matters
regardless and I honestly I know that
his opinions aren't he's not a paid
shill or anything like that he's not
getting any donations or any paid money
from Intel in video or AMD so don't
worry about that he's a even if he may
come across as bizzle that he is a
honest tech reviewer like I am and so I
will vouch for him in that regard and
that about wraps it up for today guys so
if you have any questions or comments
about today's video then or about
anything in general with tech es city
then please drop a comment in the
conversation below and I will get back
to you as soon as I can and I will catch
you guys in the next tech video very
shortly he's out for now bye get what I
use to record my youtube videos with</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
