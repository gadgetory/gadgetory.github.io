cash of cash and see how it performs in
games
and welcome back to taking our city
ladies and gentlemen this is brian
coming back to you guys today finally
with a video on level three cache and
does it affect FPS not only that does it
affect frame rates and frame latency
that's the actual experience you getting
on your monitor so for these tests I
decided to test the G 32:58 at 3.8 gigs
I then pitted it against the Xeon 12:31
v3 and I decided to disable hyper
threading on this CPU as well as to
cause so what we had here was pretty
much an apples to apples comparison
except the difference the main
difference being that this one had an
extra five megabytes of level 3 cache to
use and I also decided to throw in the
5820k which has 15 megabytes at level 3
cache they keep in mind that this CPU is
on a different platform so I kind of the
main results that I was focusing on was
these two which is pretty much an apples
to apples comparison alright without
further ado let's move on now to the
benchmarks where I tested three games
ARMA 3 Skyrim and battlefield 4 and
they'll talk about a little bit more in
depth what's going on in the benchmarks
and then we'll move on to a conclusion
so let's get on to the benchmarks now
and I will put the specs of the rigs
used in the description below so if you
want to check that out then just pop
down in the description and you'll be
able to see that there though with all
my benchmarks I'll be taking you guys
through piece by piece and letting you
know what's happening in every single
benchmark and explaining things as best
as I can because I'm sure there's a lot
of people out there who are going to be
like why what's going on here so I'll
try and explain things as best as I can
but that being said let's move on now to
the first benchmark and that is
battlefield 4 and now this was done with
pre-rendered frames set to 1 also no
vertical sync ultra on the test range at
1080p and so what we see here is that
the really all these three CPUs
impressed the results were really good
on all three of these CPUs on this test
I couldn't notice a difference when I
analyzed it with the camera footage as
well I couldn't really tell a difference
I mean there was all all three of these
CPUs did really well on this benchmark
with the exception of the 5820k scoring
a higher average FPS though we'll talk
about that later and for what it's worth
with these benchmarks I'm going to be
focusing on the third
2:58 versus the Zeon mainly because they
were done on the same motherboard same
everything same RAM same exact same Ram
speeds as a person the 5820k which is on
a different platform the x99 and he just
ddr4 memory though I still tried to get
that as close as possible though and you
probably wondering as well what is this
this is a frame latency graph so what
I've done here instead of doing 99th
percentile or anything like that
I've just taken every single frame and
put it on a scatter plot and I've put
the differences between the mean so
basically any frame or any jerky
experience will spike up out of
proportion and you'll probably be able
to notice that when it comes to gaming
but honestly all all these all these
frames here came under 30 milliseconds
which is actually a pretty good score
for what it's worth so battlefield 4
really there wasn't much of a difference
here let's move on now to ARMA 3 we've
got this again results that impressed on
all three CPUs with the exception of the
32 58 as you can see here it actually
the graph ended early for the 32 58
because that scored a lower average fps
and we'll get onto that later with
average FPS but what it's worth here all
three CPUs didn't differ much from the
mean in other words they all produced a
pretty solid gaming experience though
when I analyzed it with the camera
footage I think that 32:58 exhibited a
torn frame so that was something to come
out of this graph ARMA 3
I guess subjectively and objectively
performed better on the Xeon and the
5820k than it did on these 32:58 so I
guess for ARMA 3 level 3 cache did make
a little bit of a difference there
considering it's the only factor and
between the three CPUs in this - in
these tests sorry let's move on now to
Skyrim where we've got the 32 58 and the
other 12 31 b3 in 5820k really putting
out again a pretty impressive display
here I mean we've got here the 1231 v3
scoring the worst here with a frame that
differed from the mean by 24
milliseconds which again if you were
playing Skyrim on any of these three
CPUs was a 660ti you're going to get a
pretty damn good experience we saw here
the first part of this
the benchmark was just absolutely butter
smooth like that's almost like vsync
even better like that was incredible so
when I objectively measured this with
the camera it showed the same three same
thing so if you sat me down in the blind
ABC test I couldn't tell you the
difference at all between these three
CPUs on Skyrim though another
interesting test that I decided to throw
into the mix was what if we turned on
adaptive vsync would there be a
difference as well because I'm sure
there's some people who play RPGs with
vsync on and so again we saw here that
there really wasn't much of a difference
again even so it probably produced a
better result than it did on the
previous benchmark so that was actually
a really good eye opener there so
essentially you know and two of these
games are very CPU intensive Skyrim and
ARMA 3 their CPU intensive for what it's
worth and we weren't seeing that much of
a difference I mean I'm a three did show
three I'd say like 7% in average frames
we'll get onto that later though let's
look at the average FPS on battlefield 4
so what we had here was eighty nine
point two versus eighty nine point three
five so again the Xeon versus the
Pentium in battlefield 4 didn't make
much of a difference even the Pentium
32:58 edged out on minimum FPS so that's
probably just variance though what we
saw here was the 5820k pulling ahead in
the higher average FPS and this was
consistent when I did the benchmarks cuz
I pretty much you know I double check
all my benchmarks we saw that the 5820k
score at a higher average
I mean higher maximum which helped it
pull a higher average in my opinion so
that was pretty interesting so maybe in
battlefield 4 a lot of level 3 cache
does help give you a better gaming
experience so that's something to keep
in mind
maybe I mean when I again when I looked
at the camera footage I couldn't really
tell a difference at all in this game
looking at ARMA 3 this was the biggest
result so this is probably single
handedly this is the most important
graph to look at in all these benchmarks
is ARMA 3 because what we saw here was
the 1231 v3 scoring Pro yeah like
get off the top my head 7% difference in
frames over the 32:58 the 1231 d3 so for
what it's worth ARMA 3 made a difference
and the funny thing about this is and
this is where sort of opens up another
question for me is is there a sweet spot
for level 3 cache on games because I
know when I tested the for 670 K that I
had at four point six gigs as opposed to
5820k at four point two gigs the
difference was pretty much like
correlated in clock speeds so maybe
there's a difference maybe there's like
a sweet spot for level three cache
that's interesting and in that being
said it most likely depends on the game
as well so if you're playing arma 3 like
if you're just an ARMA 3 diehard fan
you'll probably want to get something
like a 4 7 9 TK that probably the best
CPU bang for buck
for this game or a 4690k that being said
that I mean honestly though the 32:58
just clock at higher and you'll get an
absolutely fine experience as well so
anyway let's move on now to the next
graph here this is FPS on Skyrim really
this was the most you know one of the
most insignificant results here like
just yet I mean I didn't even put the
adaptive vsync results in because
they're pretty much identical and so we
got here too I mean these are almost
identical as well you get two extra FPS
coming out a level 3 cache so only one
game really made a difference in FBS and
the frame latency and when I measured it
with the camera didn't make too much of
a difference though another interesting
benchmark that I will throw into the mix
is Cinebench when I ran Cinebench the
actual center bench test itself didn't
show a difference but the OpenGL tests
showed a huge difference this was with
the only the like again I had 2 cores 2
threads the the only difference was the
level 3 cache and it made a huge
difference on that OpenGL test so that
was something interesting that came out
of the benchmarks on Cinebench anyway
guys with that being said let's move on
now to a conclusion for you guys and
we'll talk about pretty much what just
happened so in conclusion the results
were pretty anticlimactic I came into
these bench
expecting more of a difference from
level 3 cache but the reality is there
just wasn't that much of a difference
between these 3 CPUs coupled with a
660ti now the biggest difference to be
gained was from ARMA 3 where it showed
like an 8% increase in frames which was
pretty big and that probably raises
another question of is there a sweet
spot for level 3 cache with certain
games and the main answer is it depends
on the game that's the biggest thing
that I got out of this every games coded
differently and level 3 cache can make a
difference though it really pales in
comparison to other things like your
core speed your core clock speed the IPC
your core and thread count and the price
of the CPU so level 3 cache ultimately
isn't something that you should really
take into heart when buying a CPU though
it is pretty important for other things
just for gaming it doesn't make that
much of a difference now another thing
is as to as I coupled this CPU with a
660ti and this is something that I'm
going to stress from this video even
though it's not really related is that
when you're buying a low end CPU like
the G 32:58
make sure you couple it with like a low
end or a mid-range graphics card do not
go coupling this thing with it like an
online 290 X or GTX 980 like I've got a
heap of comments now where people are
telling me they're getting a crap gaming
experience and they've got a 32 58 and
they're coupling with a high end CPU
like don't do that I've tested it in the
past I've tested my pen in with the 780
lightning in the past and it was just a
crap experience like I seriously had
more fun playing games with the G 32:58
on a 760 than I did on a 780 lightning
so it's something to keep in mind when
you're going with a low in CPU just
remember that you have to balance things
out now dx12 might change that I don't
know there's not many mainstream games
or if any that used the X 12 at the
moment so for what it's worth level 3
cache doesn't make too much of a
difference for games and if you have any
comments or questions drop a comment in
the comment section below and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can and if you
haven't already then hit that like
button as this video took me a long time
to do in terms of compiling and
double-checking the results and I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon and you can hit the subscribe
button if you want to
check me out on social media and I'll
catch you in another tech video peace
out for now bye well conditions rubbing
your feet on carpet whatever
