have been making fun of me in the
comments some of them quite funny
actually but this should make me feel
sad lost but when I get home and I see
her lying there I'm automatically lifted
with joy for what she can do is
completely fabulous welcome to tech city
this is brian coming to you guys today
with a review of the gtx 1070 gaming x
from msi this time around they have
included RGB LEDs on the side and even
integrated one into the backplate
definitely stepping up the game for
cosmetics though it doesn't just stop
with cosmetics this cooler is a heavy
implementation with the card weighing in
at roughly 1.1 kilograms the vrm is a 10
phase design with you bet QM three eight
one six and six MOSFETs with the high
side which is rated at 51 amps and the
low side rated 117 amps integrated into
one circuit forming what is known as the
jewel and MOSFET design the Superferry
chokes are rated at 60 amps and ms I've
included solid state 8k caps on the
board ok ok I get it
let's hit those benchmarks
as you can see from the benchmarks this
card was very impressive out of the box
sporting an overclock that hits over two
gigahertz at all times without me even
touching anything I also managed to get
a little bit extra out of it in terms of
over clocks especially on the memory
which is also from Samsung by the way
though the best thing about this card
was it was just whisper quiet the whole
way through benchmarking from stock
settings to custom over clocks let's
take a quick listen so looking over this
gratis card there really is nothing to
fault here except for one thing I'd like
to see a dual BIOS if possible though it
does have a really solid build quality
it has the cosmetics it has the aloha ku
Stix and it also features a PCB size
that is extra wide with MSI implementing
their own custom vrm moving over the
front of the unit the red accents light
up red too which would fit perfectly
into a red and black theme build looking
at the outputs you have three display
ports one HDMI 2.0 and also a DVI out it
has SLI support for up to three way and
features two PCIe connections one a six
pin and one and eight pin also power
consumption was really good as well
coming under that of the 980ti when
overclocked and both out of the box
settings as for the performance the gtx
1070 was beating the non ati out of the
box though once the 980 TI overclocked
it did edged it out in a lot of those
games ultimately however this card is a
card that hits all the boxes in my
opinion and the included software is
actually usable allowing you to control
the led colors and mix it with other
products like their motherboard you can
also select the overclock mode and have
grass being displayed in real time to
monitor temps and whatnot while gaming
as for pricing you can currently pick
this card up for around about 699 AUD or
around 408 USD if you're in the u.s.
from Amazon though honestly if you are
an Australian you're probably better off
just going to Amazon in the States and
then just converting to a you do I think
that way you'll save around one hundred
and fifty dollars which is pretty huge
they'll get great job from MSI and is a
really solid card that I can recommend
to pretty much anyone out there anyway
that's about it for me today if you like
these videos and be sure to hit that
like button if you have any questions or
comments about the gtx 1070
Gaming acts and be sure to drop a
comment in the comment section below and
I'll get back to you as soon as I can
also let me know do you have a gtx 1070
at the moment if so what model if not
let me know would you want one if so why
and if not why not
we'd love to hear your comments as usual
and I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon peace out for now
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
