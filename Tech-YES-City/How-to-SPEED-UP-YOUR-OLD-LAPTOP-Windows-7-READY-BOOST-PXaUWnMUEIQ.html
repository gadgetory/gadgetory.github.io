just coming back to you guys today with
a request so I got asked to look at
Windows 7 readyboost now first of all
let me explain what Windows 7 readyboost
is if you guys don't know basically on
an old laptop so if you have a new
computer guys don't really worry about
this but if you know someone with an old
laptop or a really old computer then
this will indeed make a pretty big
difference so first this is my wife's
laptop guys it's a old like five years
old it's um you know it's it's very slow
so I got 512 megabytes of RAM and it's
all my wife needs all she does is check
YouTube all she does is check Facebook
checking email so it's just the real
she's just a casual user she doesn't
need a powerful system so guys basically
what windows 7 readyboost is is that it
uses you know Windows 7 automatically
uses your hard drive when it doesn't
have enough ran it'll use your hard
drive is what's called virtual memory
so what readyboost does is instead of
using the hard drivers virtual Ram it'll
use this USB flash deck and now I USB
flash TV USB to flash bits stick guys
will be faster than a 5400 rpm hard disk
so it won't be faster than SSD of course
not but it you know it will be faster
than an old-school hard drive and so
this here is going to make a little bit
of a difference so without further ado
let me get on let me show you guys how
to do it so basically for this I've got
a two gigabyte USB flash drive and all
I'm going to do is put it in here so
I'll put this in here and basically guys
the bad thing about this is it will take
up a USB port so when you want to use
this it's going to take up a USB port
okay so I'll just zoom in there to show
you guys what options we've got okay so
I'll lock I'll take off the autofocus
too so it doesn't blur okay guys so
we're in focus now and hopefully once
you insert the USB stick you will come
up it'll automatically come up with a
menu for you okay so this is in Japanese
so sorry my wife's computers she's
Japanese so laptops in Japanese but but
it also you want to do is click on this
icon here with the clock and the you
beast excites system ready booster speed
up my system with readyboost
you want to click on the option the
third option so use the device for
readyboost and we're going to use in
this case I don't need this USB stick
guys and say especially one that's just
sitting around my house doing nothing
I've got like two other four gigabyte
ones so I don't need this two gigabyte
one anymore and I'm just going to use
the whole thing obviously if you use
your USB stick if you've got a 4
gigabyte you only want to use 2 gu bus
then take it all the way down a half or
you know and use half the files and use
half for readyboost
but I'm going to use the whole thing in
this case and I'm going to click apply
and that's going to be getting ready now
so yep and that's all that's all guys it
takes no time at all
the only negative is that it uses up a
USB port as I said for so uses up a USB
port and obviously it uses up a USB
stick as well so the negatives aren't
that bad though so I think the positives
as we see here will just spam in a few
sites or as keyboards pretty bad but we
just you know and it's just so much less
sluggish now so we can just do so much
more on this old laptop that we couldn't
do before and it's just amazing I'm
pretty surprised so just really amazed
so it's really cool you know you can pop
up eBay there whatever you know and you
just pop up all these sites and it's
just a lot less sluggish so overall guys
the positives far outweigh the negatives
of readyboost thank you Tata Soros for
showing me this he actually told me this
mentioned this to me and it's actually
really good because now my wife's going
to be happy because their laptop she
just went out for today so she's going
to get back and she's going to notice
that her laptop is a lot faster sorry
guys if you've got a partner or your a
friend or anyone who has an old sort of
laptop and they just want to get that
little bit of extra performance out of
their laptop then this is a very I
really recommend doing this it's really
good actually I'm really surprised so
yeah guys I hope you enjoyed this today
and if you've got any questions please
let me know in the comment section below
so and otherwise yeah picks it up and
our brain is Ebates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
