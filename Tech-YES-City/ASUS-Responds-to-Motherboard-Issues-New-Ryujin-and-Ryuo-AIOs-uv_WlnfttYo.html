for pax 2018 and I have some questions
here behind the scenes of what's been
going on with the reviewers getting
ninety five what limits is that because
the board's essentially just can't
handle the ninety nine hundred K when
it's over Glocks and they responded to
me and said no these motherboards
especially the Maximus here are eleven
it can handle well over two hundred
watts absolutely find no problems what
was happening with those motherboard
civically was when you jump into the
BIOS it asks you do you want to use the
Zeus recommended settings and so if you
hit no it'll then lock in Intel
recommended settings which the Intel
recommended settings will then lock in a
95 watt TDP limit unfortunately but I've
been checking out these CPUs here
because something I noted in my review
of the Maximus hero 11 and when I looked
at that board I did overclock the 99
hundred K and the vrm was absolutely
fine when I checked it in real time
that's without a fan on it too by the
way so one thing I did forget to mention
in that review was the silicon
prediction which is part of the AI
optimization and Zeus actually showed me
here on the floor a live demonstration
of what it can do
and now with this technology is
implemented in the prime a or better
motherboard so like Strix motherboards
rog motherboards will have this feature
implemented and what you do is you can
load up with your overclockable intel
cpu whether it's an 8700 k or 99 hundred
k load up prime95 and then you can hit
small FFT so you can hit a custom blend
and it'll start learning the maximum
capabilities of the cpu and you do this
for 5 minutes then you jump back into
the BIOS and you now have a prediction
on the voltage and also the sweet spot
essentially for this CPU so right behind
me here we've got an 80 700 k and it's
going to 1.1 4 volt we locked that in
manually 4.6 gigahertz and then we load
it back up into Windows and we now have
a stable four point six years running
out really good voltages so you see it
behind me it's been running here I've
been testing out the features been
running well over 20 minutes absolutely
no problems and we know with small FFTs
what that does to the CPU it's
essentially one of the worst torture
tests you can put on a hyper threaded
CPU or a CPU with SMT for that matter so
all these monitors here as well you
probably notice in call of duty black
ops 4 is being run all around this whole
booth here it's pretty crazy to get into
the environment as usama they're all
being run on the AI mesh network
essentially all their routers can link
into each other providing all internet
connections off of one separate internet
modem for example pretty crazy when you
think about it cuz now the whole of
packs can essentially be wired with
really good coverage from the AI mesh
network this is something that they told
me that it's implemented into the azusa
routers and we're taking a look at one
of these previously on the channel it
was very easy to use but also had the
advanced features and all that jazz so
pretty much when it comes to routers and
monitors as zeus have it all covered and
they're not afraid to show it off so
right beside me here as well as a new
product being brought to market by asus
this is their ROG do gin taking after a
bit of a Japanese naming
came there 360 240 and then they've also
got though door 240 and 120
now all these coolers have an OLED
readout as well so it will tell you
things like temperature voltage and also
overclock speeds as well as being able
to dial in your own custom image if you
wish to on this cooler they do look
really sleek and of course they do cool
really well I was testing out some
prime95 small FFTs on these coolers
before and we're getting a maximum of 76
degrees I believe it's a Nandi litter
chip as well so they can provide the
cooling when necessary however they do
come in with a premium of $200 or more
starting from the 120 and going all the
way up to the 360 milverton's so they
are definitely a luxury item there but
they will give you a nice bling and nice
aesthetic especially if you got
see-through panels which most cases do
nowadays in Jen's the release dates you
can expect to see them on the shelves in
the next week or so so right here behind
me we've got the call of duty black ops
4 tournament all being played of course
on a Zeus ROG monitors keyboards and
mice now if you are at PAX get down here
to the booze because it's not just ROG
booth as well but it's also plenty of
other booths that have a lot of
discounts going on things like
peripherals and monitors as zeus here
have a discount on their headsets their
keyboards their - their monitors and get
in with an absolute bargain now I did
try some of their keyboards in their
mice and I did like their fingertip grip
Mouse as well did fit the hand really
well so I might even be picking up one
of these things because because this is
a really cool atmosphere a really cool
environment to be around high-energy
hope you guys have enjoyed this video -
if you have any questions or comments
about the motherboards or about the
monitors or the headsets or the mice or
the keyboards or the AI over tuning
overclocking feature and be sure to drop
a comment in the con section below and
also the new coolers as well which will
be hitting the market very soon
interesting to see that a Zeus is slowly
branching in to pretty much all things
PC if you enjoyed this one then be sure
to hit that like button and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
these out for now bye
contract only the best low for the best
is more can I raise I check this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
