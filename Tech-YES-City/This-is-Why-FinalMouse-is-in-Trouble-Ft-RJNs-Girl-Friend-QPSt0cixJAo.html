for 2019's Computex.
I am joined by Rocket Jump
Ninja Zy's girlfriend, Jamie,
how you doing?
- I am doing fabulous.
- Basically, your boyfriend
is going to be taking a look
at these new mice, right?
- I'm so excited for him to try this out,
he's going to absolutely love it.
(upbeat techno music)
- Basically we've got two
different models on display here.
The MM710 and the MM711, the
two differences between them
is that one's got RGB, the other doesn't,
and they're also coming in
a white and black aesthetic.
Now, we're talking 52
grams, fingertip grip mouse.
So, for all you guys out there
that don't like palm
grip mice, like myself,
this is going to give
you that lightweight,
final mouse feel, but be a proper shape
for fingertip grippers.
Now, we're talking the switches,
Huano switches on the top,
and on the left, it's a
mouse that's designed for
people who are right handed,
since those two side buttons
are on the left hand side.
They've also got the honeycomb
punch-outs all throughout
the mouse, obviously to reduce the weight,
and make it so that it just
glides on any type of mousepad.
Underneath, you've got
three different feet.
Two down the bottom, one up
the top, which will give you
that hyper glide feel.
But also now, for the sensor details,
I'll move over to Jamie that
can give you a little bit more
information about what
sensor is going on inside.
- All right, so the sensor
that the mouse carries
is actually a 3389 sensor.
You get up to 32 kdpi,
so we have top of the line everything.
For my boyfriend Zy, he's gonna love it.
Let me see, what else.
This is actually not the
cord that's gonna come
with the actual mouse, this
is a very early mockup sample,
so we're actually gonna have paracord,
and it's just gonna be fabulous.
- So that's what I was talking
about before with the cable,
they are gonna be releasing
these with a paracorded cable.
It's going to be a
little bit more flexible,
little bit more lightweight.
The final product, I can't
wait for it personally, too.
I don't even really review mice,
but I want one of these
things on my desktop.
So now one thing I can't test
with these mice is obviously
the performance in games and how it
performs in the real world.
But I won't be able to
do that and Zy won't be
able to do that until
they get one on the desk,
the final product.
However, I can tell you
that the clicks across all
the four different models
here has been very consistent,
and so it does look like Cooler
Master is coming to market
with something that is going to work.
Now, speaking of the RGB?
- So, the placement of the
RGB is not yet finalized,
the sample that you're
seeing here has RGB on the
scroll wheel and on our little hex logo,
and as you can see the
second sample over here
only has RGB on the scroll wheel.
We haven't finalized these
details, but we will soon.
So stay tuned.
- And now, with release dates,
I'll let Jamie take that
away again for you guys.
- So with our MM710, which
is the non RGB model,
we're looking at a September launch,
so not too far from now.
And then our MM711 model, with RGB,
we're looking at about a December launch.
- So that's about it for
the actual mice here.
We'll move onto some other products,
but before we do I'll do a
quick sound test for you guys,
cause I know Zy's going to absolutely
love those sound tests.
The gold mike will be able to hook up.
(mouse clicking rapidly)
Moving onto the liquid coolers,
behind me is the first to
be released to the market.
This is the MasterLiquid ML240P Mirage,
basically got an updated
block with instead of having a
flow meter like a lot
of the competitors do,
this is the actual pump
itself flowing around.
So it's not a flow meter,
no little fan or whatever.
This is the real deal inside.
So it's going to help
with cooling performance,
obviously it's going to
be Cooler Master's own
in house design, not going
with that ace tech stuff
that you always see out there.
But beside it, here is the real deal.
This is something that Cooler Master
hasn't actually yet finalized.
So they need your help out in the audience
to see whether you like the design or not.
Essentially, doubling up on
the pumps inside this block,
but also giving out a
very, very, in my opinion,
sexy aesthetic, to go with that.
And then going to the
rad, which is external.
This one, again, still doesn't know on
pricing or availability and
they still don't even know
if they'll finalize it.
It's a concept, so let
us know in the comments
what you guys think of this design.
But moving over here is the
LED screen, or the OLED display
on top of the block itself.
This is the MasterLiquid
ML240P Vivid, and so with that
you can hook it up to a
USB port on your computer,
get all the details read
out, change it to things like
CPU temperature, if you
want to change it to
GPU temperature, clock speed,
or your voltage on your CPU,
then you can do that.
Also hooked up to a 240mL rad,
and all these coolers of
course featuring that RGB bling
on the radiator with the included fans.
In terms of the vivid, it's
looking like it'll come out
in early 2020, so stay tuned for that,
if you're really keen on bling,
but getting some information
out on your block.
Now the last piece to go through here
is the MasterLiquid ML240M
Mirage do it yourself.
This, just like two of
the other coolers here,
are still a long way from
production and release.
But this one, just like the Jewel Mirage,
is still a concept.
So again, Cooler Master needs you guys
out there in the audience, your feedback,
on whether you are digging
this design or not.
And as you can see, in the
actual reservoir itself,
we've got a tornado going
on here, and I've gotta say,
this is for me, next level.
This is moving beyond
RGB with what you can do
with a computer and bling.
So tornado, they are a
little bit worried, however,
about getting all that
air in the circulation,
is it going to cause a problem?
But for me, when I just saw this thing,
I thought, &quot;wow&quot;. That's
pretty cool to stare at.
I could just sit there for
days and look at my tornado
while I'm starving.
Now we've got five new air
coolers coming out here
from Cooler Master, one of
which you may already remember.
This is the MA620M, but on the AMD side,
it was also known as the Ray Thripper.
Above that is two mini
ITX orientated coolers,
G200P and the G400P.
I'll put the details
on all these coolers up
on a little sidebar for you
guys so that you can see
release dates and prices,
but basically 95 Watt TDP
in such a small form factor.
Then we've got the G400P,
cooling up to 150 Watt of TDP.
That's something to get excited about,
But, moving along here,
we've got the 3DVVC.
This is basically gonna be
for AMD and Intel platforms.
Especially with that new X570 coming out,
people are gonna want some
new bling, something subtle,
to go with the looks.
This thing's got dual sided
fans, so it's going to do
a great job of cooling
down even a 12 core.
Then besides that we've got the 212X SE.
Now, we've got RGB, that's
the obvious addition here,
and it's pretty much
replacing the holmarkle.
Not replacing it, just giving
it a bit of an extra option,
for those who are ready like the 212X,
but want a bit of bling inside.
And that about wraps things
up for the Cooler Master booth
here at Computex 2019.
If you guys enjoyed this video,
especially enjoyed Rocket Jump
Ninja's girlfriend on camera,
then be sure to hit that Like button.
And also on their cases they
got the new C700P in the black,
but in terms of cases,
I've got some reviews of
some of their new cases coming to market.
They'll be released on the
channel in the coming months.
So make sure you stay tuned for that
by ringing that sub button and the bell.
And that'll give you the videos as soon as
they drop here at TechYESCity.
Also let us know in the
comment section below what
products you are digging here
the most in today's video,
and I'll be sure to
catch you guys in another
tech video very soon.
Peace out for now.
Bye.
(electronic music)
(beep)
- Okay. I will make sure
to get one over for you.
- I don't just want one, though.
- I mean obviously I'm
gonna get him both models,
the RGB model and the non RGB model.
- I don't just want two.
- Obviously I'm gonna get him
the RGB model in both black
and white, and the non RBG
model in both black and white.
- Now we're talking.
