RTX 2060 and the gigabyte mini popped up
and I just had to have it so I went out
and bought this one but at the same time
gigabyte asked me to take a look at
their gaming OC Pro so I thought why not
get both these cards here and test it
against the RT X 2060 founders which
I've already done a review on if you
want to check it out up here where it
performed really well the cooler that
Nvidia is implemented here did a great
job of overclocking whilst also staying
quiet and keeping the temperatures down
but today we've taken these two graphs
cards overclocking I'm testing out the
stock performance the power consumptions
the acoustics the thermals basically the
whole tech yes tour and I'm actually
rooting for the little guy here the
little mini he's almost half the size of
this guy here the gaming OC Pro and so
we've got the big guy and then we've got
the super big guy versus the little guy
so let us know in the comments guys who
are you rooting for and if you're not
rooting for any of these three gravis
cards let me know what are you rooting
for and without a side let's unbox these
things and get you guys some gaming
performance figures
so there's a benchmarks tested at 1080p
between these three r-tx 2060s and the
reason I haven't put any other graphics
cards in this comparison is because I
wanted to see how these cards perform
specifically compared to the founders
edition cut you want to see how they
2060 performs overall against the other
graphics cards like the 2070 and also
the 2080 and the AMD variants then I'll
put the link again up here for the 2060
review but what we saw a far cry 5 was
that the gaming OC Pro out of the box it
comes ahead by a little bit but once we
started overclocking the founders
Edition and also the mini they started
pulling ahead of the OC prone it was by
quite a little bit I'd say it's by the
roughly the same gap that the OC probe
performs at the stock so you can see
moving through these results as we move
through resin and evil to when we move
through shadows of the Tomb Raider metro
Exodus and also battlefield 5 it was
pretty much a similar trend throughout
all these five games and so what was
going on here why was the OC Pro not
performing as well as the other two once
we started overclocking and I'd have to
put it down to the actual power limit
the OC per for some odd reason had a
limit of a hundred and thirteen percent
I won't compare that to the mini the
cheapest variant of all three here
especially in Australia where it comes
in $22 Ozzy cheaper than the founders
edition card that was going up to a
hundred and twenty five percent power
limit so the only thing holding back the
mini really was the cooler itself which
actually did a pretty good job and will
show you guys the results here the
gigabyte solution actually surprised me
here I thought it would crumble
especially when overclocked and usually
when I do these temps thermals and
acoustics are usually just doing with
overclocked levels because they
represent a worst case scenario here we
had a ambient temperature of 25 degrees
Celsius so it is a little bit hot
especially when you compare it to some
people who live in sub 20 degree
temperatures but when we go here to 100%
fan speeds was 59 decibels honestly this
was getting very loud it still kept it
at 64 degrees C then we go down to 80
percent and it was some reason my sound
meter was measuring 55 decibels and we
got 69 degrees here but this would me
personally was
one of the sweetspot areas even though
it was a 55 decibel noise level it was
actually bearable I don't know what it
was maybe if someone studied sound
acoustics they can weigh in here as to
why this thing was actually quite loud
but it wasn't annoying at all moving
down to 60% saw the noise levels dropped
tremendously where we've got 39 decibels
that's 78 degrees so we are starting to
approach that hotter area and then the
auto fan speeds went to 73 percent and
they got about 45 decibels so basically
with the Mini itself if you get this car
whether you're overclocking it or using
it out of the box just leave the fan
speeds on auto as they do quite a good
job of balancing noise and thermals in
terms of the weight and size of this
thing it comes in at 170 millimeters
long it also has a little bit of extra
width on the PCB making it 10 mil
thicker at 121 Mills versus a hundred
and eleven on the OSI pro and also the
founders Edition it weighs in at roughly
505 grams compared to the founders
editions 965 grams and then the OC
programs and the OSI protocol Zin at 280
mil long so it is longer than the
founders editions 230 mil and it has
three fans versus two fans versus one
fan so we kind of got a three to one
thing going on here but speaking of the
temperatures and noise of the OSI Pro
this of course paired the best of the
group here coming with Auto settings of
56% which kept the noise levels at a
pretty impressive 34 decibels at 69
degrees and then moving on to 60% we had
39 decibels and 66 degrees 80 percent so
45 decibel 60 degrees and a hundred
percent so 55 decibels and 56 degrees
they probably thinking it's a little bit
unfair since the mini and also the
founders overclocked higher than the OSI
Pro but here's where things get a little
bit weird as well the OSI Pro was using
up the most power out of all three
gravis cards when I was testing power
consumption both out of the box and also
overclocked so it was the most
inefficient in terms of power
consumption between these three cards I
tested here today the mini was getting
the best performance out of the box and
there was overclock ii did pretty good
too
the founders edition that's a solid
implementation of an RT X 2060 through
and through but basically to cap
everything off with this comparison and
review of these two cards here I'll
quickly show you the overclock numbers
in the form of a graph where the memory
speeds were all pretty similar across
all three different samples however
again I'll reiterate that the founders
Edition also the mini did perform better
in actual GPU core clocks than the OC
prone I believe that again has to do
with that power limit of a hundred and
thirteen percent versus one hundred
eighteen versus a hundred and twenty
five on the gigabyte Mini one thing I'd
love to see with this little card right
here is to put a water block on it and
see how high you can get this thing
because I was just actually coming out
of this review very impressed with this
card but physically speaking you don't
get a backplate you get three
DisplayPort 1.4 outs as well as a HDMI
2.0 out that expands again to the OC Pro
having the same input and output on the
graphics card itself also featuring an 8
pin versus an 8 pin versus an 8 pin on
the founders Edition however with the
founders Edition you do lose one
DisplayPort out and you do gain a USB
type-c as well as a DVI out the OC
progess like the founders Edition
however does feature a backplate and
does have some RGB lighting on the side
which you can control via software
anyway guys to cap things all off with
this review of these three cards is the
price in the US you can get the founders
Edition for 350 and you can also get the
mini for 350 the OC pro 390 us so it is
coming in $40 more expensive on Amazon
and in Australia this is six hundred and
nineteen Ozzie dollars versus five
hundred and seventy eight versus five
hundred and ninety nine so the minis the
cheapest in Australia and in my opinion
it is gonna serve people who want to
build a mini ITX rig very well now keep
in mind the thermals you did see here
today are going to be affected if you
are using a mini ITX case with not so
good air flow so the air flows up to you
if you're going to be putting one of
these in a case which I'll be doing very
soon here on the channel so stay tuned
make sure you have good airflow
otherwise this thing will get very hot
and or possibly throttle in
the ITX solution the founders edition
card as I said in the original review
great build quality great overclocks
I was impressed with the design it looks
very sleek so basically the OSI Pro I
could only really recommend this for
someone who either really loves the look
and design of this card versus the other
two cards here or any other r-tx 2060
and they don't want to download MSI
Afterburner or an overclocking program
and just change a few sliders it does
perform a little bit better out of the
box but I don't feel that extra price
increase warrants the extra performance
especially when they found this addition
card and also the mini overclock to
higher levels and give you better
performance and value for money so
sometimes it's not always about the dog
in the fight it's the fight in the dog
or if you're in Australia I can give you
guys a different example sometimes it's
not always the Commodore that the bogan
owns but more so the bogan in the
commodore but also Utley the gigabyte RT
x 2060 mini did so well in today's
battle I came into this thinking this
thing would sort of fail especially once
we started overclocking it and thermal
performance but it impressed me to the
point where I can recommend this thing
for mini ITX users even if you want to
get this thing and chuck a cost of
waterblock on it I don't know if there
is one for this but I'd love to see one
then this thing is definitely going to
give you a good experience it's a good
design good job gigabyte but I would
like to see the OSI pro especially have
some limits up lifted especially to that
of the founders edition card we could
see some better performance out of that
but other than that guys I hope you
enjoyed today's review if you did then
be sure to hit that like button let us
know in the comment section below what
you think of these r-tx cards we've
featured here today and also what you
think of the little guy here coming in
at a hundred and seventy mill my hand is
actually bigger than this graphics card
and I look forward to giving you guys
the mini ITX builds soon which is going
to be really good we're using a case
from 2011 so if you want to see that
make sure you say subbed with those
notifications turned on you're not going
to want to miss this one but also if you
want the inside scoop before it even
hits youtube be sure to check us out at
tech yes
on Instagram and without aside I will
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon
peace out for now and buddy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
