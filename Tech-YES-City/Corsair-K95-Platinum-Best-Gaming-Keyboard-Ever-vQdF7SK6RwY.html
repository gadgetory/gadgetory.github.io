bamboozled wham who's all king of the
mountain keyboard the k95 platinum but
of course carries a king of the mountain
price tag though what do you get for
this price and is it worthy of your
money let's find out welcome back to
tech yes City in the k95 platinum
features a custom switch from cherry
label DMX speed which is a linear key
with no feedback and as the name
suggests actuates at a higher point one
point two millimeters to be exact
making a superior for gaming than a
cherry MX red switch or any other switch
currently out there
the key themselves feature core says
bold font over abs key caps and the RGB
lighting is very controlled and dare I
say elegant reflecting off the milled
black anodized alloy which extends
around the front of the keyboard and the
top of the keyboard features the corsair
logo and another RGB stripe for extra
elegance the included wrist rest is also
very nice to type on and has a soft yet
firm grip to it one of the best included
wrist rests I have used anyway let's do
a quick noise test on those switches for
you guys there is a 2 meter braided
cable which splits into two ends one of
which is a USB pass-through with the
rear of the keyboard featuring the port
you also get an additional 10 included
grey rugged grip coated keys and a key
cap puller besides that is coarse as 6
macro keys which through software you
can remap or program to you guessed it
macros the software itself is quite
simply first-class having the options to
change individual backlighting layer and
even opaque other lighting settings sort
of like Photoshop editing for your
keyboard you can also save and change to
different profiles on the fly from the
software too you can also update the
firmware or contact Corsairs customer
support if you have any problems the
keyboard at the top has extra function
keys like brightness settings which come
in three different levels of 33 66 and
100% or completely off the back lighting
has an
time look to it that glows through the
letters and numbers and has many
different patterns to choose from which
as I said earlier can be layered on this
keyboard to have many different effects
going at the same time with different
levels of Oh peaking - there's also a
windows lock key and profile switch
button and to the right of the keyboard
you get standard media control keys and
also a volume knob with a mute button
the back of the keyboard has an
additional level of height adjustment
and features four feet in the corners of
the keyboard with the k95 branding so
now it's time to test this keyboard in
games and world of warcraft came to mind
here with those extra six keys being
able to be remapped which allowed me to
have more options available and also my
pro arena wall to walk our friends tell
me they love the corset keyboard because
of the proximity of the F 1 to F 4 keys
being so close to the numbers and
movement Keys that they can reliably use
them in twos and threes trying this
keyboard out and csgo as well just felt
so damn smooth even though in this game
your mouse of course is going to far
outweigh the importance of your keyboard
and lastly testing the N key roll over
26 key feature worked flawlessly
surviving the crazy spam test that I
threw at it with flying colors so its
verdict time with the K 95 platinum
coming in at a whopping 200 USD or if
you're in Australia the cheapest I could
find it for is 300 Australian dollars
though you might just want to get it
shipped from Amazon to your door anyway
if your instrument worth your money well
that depends if you quite simply want
the best keyboard bar none especially
for gaming I absolutely love the speed
consistency build quality and software
associated with this keyboard you get
what you pay for comes to mind here and
what you are getting is just one heck of
the keyboard with the standout points
being one point two millimeter actuation
extremely comfortable wrist rest and a
solid and consistent build quality that
expanded to each individual key there's
also a gunmetal gray look if you don't
like the old black even though I prefer
the sleek all-black look there's also a
Cherry MX brown switches too though what
about a comparison to the real force RGB
which I branded the best keyboard ever
well for typing I still prefer the real
force keys which is a highly subjective
thing as they have feedback and I find
myself making less typos on keys with
tactile feedback on them though for
everything else including game
this keyboard for me comes an easy first
I think Corsair quite simply have nailed
it with the k95 platinum anyway guys if
you enjoyed this review then be sure to
hit that like button and if you disliked
it then slam the dislike button and let
me know in the comments section below
do you like the k95 platinum do you want
this thing on your desk anyway guys I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
