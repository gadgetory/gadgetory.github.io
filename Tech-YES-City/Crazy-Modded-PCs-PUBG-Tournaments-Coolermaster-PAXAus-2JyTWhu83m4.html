I'm joined by Josh Adelman good man how
about yourself really good now we're at
the Coolermaster booth and they've got
custom mods right make it yours but I
gotta say before we start this video
dude all right
computation I didn't get one of those
hats I got rejected I'm sorry bro that
we you know loaded up D underscore
denied but bro we got you now we got oh
damn oh I see guys I'm going on now I'm
playing csgo on that map called de
stroyed that's where we're going yeah so
now we got the custom mods behind us
this one being the most craziest build
I've seen yet pop G massive games so
popular what have we got here so this is
a collaborative build right so this is
actually done between Steven ho dove
tech modified and Cory Gregory of
designs by IFR two of Australia's top
case models so they've come together to
do a crazy build like this pumped it out
in four days it was live streams 26
hours of coverage and you can see it for
yourself it's a stunner four days that's
pretty impressive for the job they've
done I mean what are the specs in this
thing though yes oh dude basically this
thing's packed out with wicked hardware
we've got a core i7 CPU at the heart of
it we've got SLI GT X 1080 graphics
cards so it looks the goods for the game
it'll also smash out the game so it's
it's winning bro doesn't just look like
the part it plays the part and pop G's
definitely a game that's very demanding
right oh dude some of those framerate
drops can be really intense but when
you're running SLI ten eighties it's a
non-issue thing is with Coolermaster
though they're making this happen right
there supporting the modifiers and also
they've got a big focus of their own
with their cases to allow the cases to
be modified themselves so what case is
this a base case we've got here what is
it well actually you may not be able to
see it in there but it's the H 500 P
then you have yeah damn so now we're
here with the custom modified PC I did
see this at Computex but we didn't
really cover it you want to tell us more
about this one - right so this is street
Dreams and this is made by Steven hoed
of Tech modified in a collaboration
build with a Portuguese graffiti artist
named lon
key so he's come through and contributed
in terms of all the sort of graffiti
styles here and then Stevens comes
through modified it's opened it up a bit
put in the lighting and it's just a
killer system it's got it's a straight
dream now we're here with the last of
the custom pieces on display at paxos do
you want to tell us more about this one
so this one here is using the cooler
master master case maker 5 t it's built
by ethan cooper of technology and gaming
and space around the witcher and the pc
itself is called the wild hunt pc so
it's kitted out with latest greatest
hardware inside there as well as just
some additions on the outside so to
bring through that real you know which
are theming so now one thing with
enthusiast companies in the pc market is
getting involved in the community now
behind me we've got a heat but cooler
monster cases kitted out with good
hardware and they're playing pop g
they're letting people come in play Bob
G now what's going on with this
competition here so dude it's all about
just getting involved that's what we
want to see we want to be inviting
people who perhaps have never played pub
G come along have a game get in there
and if you happen to get through to the
top ten out of the hundred people in the
server we're going to give away a
Coolermaster gaming mouse pad and if
they happen to get the chicken dinner
that is first place then we're just
going to make it rain loot and it's been
a lot of fun
we've had one chicken dinner this
weekend and a lot of top ten so we've
just been you know handing out gear left
right and centre has been fun the last
piece of this puzzle here at the
Coolermaster booth is my yeah they're
making this possible so what tell us a
bit warmer what's going on with them
wave and how they're contributing with
the coolermaster booth
so basically Coolermaster wanted to pair
with a reseller that we knew was going
to be community driven and is involved
within the community in terms of gaming
and knows what gamers won and so we're
like hey get involved here with us we
want to share some deals with everyone
so we've got up to 40% off our gaming
peripherals so the keyboards the mice
and the headsets and guys everyone's
been loving it it's been awesome so with
that there are pretty much a few guys
with em wave as well they offer
pre-built pcs now on my channel I'm not
a big fan of the pre builds but if you
you know there are people out there who
just don't want to build a PC they don't
have time or they don't know and it's
sort of tricky and getting into PC
gaming you just wouldn't go buy a
prebuilt and then you can get into it
after that maybe mod your PC after that
so
they do offer good pre-built packages
yeah absolutely dude you know like I'm
enthusiast to my absolute core and I
started out when I was like 13 14 with a
prebuilt system so everyone has to start
somewhere and it helps if you have
enthusiasts building a system for you as
well
you have that extra bit of insight there
you go and wave have you covered for
that guys and if you have any questions
for Joshua just drop a comment in the
comment section below some of these mods
were looking really hot today and I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon peace out for now oh yeah
catch it later guy that's been an
absolute pleasure always great to be
with you man it's meant to be peace out
for now bye peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
