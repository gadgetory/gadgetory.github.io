deal we picked up for 500 ozzie dollars
in October's use PC parts hunt of the
month so I seven sixty seven hundred
sixteen gigabytes of ddr4 memory and
it's also an alienware I guess with some
fancy LEDs on it and this is a thing
about this I'm not sure how this is
gonna go down because the Dell power
brick over here is 330 watts so it is a
beast it will indeed power at gtx 1066
gigabyte we do have a failsafe here
which is a gtx 1050 TI but what i was
thinking was with this build 16
gigabytes of ddr4 memory is too good for
either of these graphics cards in my
opinion 6700 as well that can be used
for a higher-end build and since we do
have an i3 6100 and also a gigabytes of
ddr4 memory we can swap those over and
then try and fit in a 1066 gigabyte and
then upsell but also with the upsell we
can then try and extract the 6700
obviously the additional 8 gigabytes of
ddr4 memory for another build and since
we do replace the i7 for example with an
i3 we will be using less power and that
will help with this case here because
this side panel if we see here there's
no airflow at all it's completely
blocked off so I have read some comments
people saying this thing does overheat
when you put a higher-end graphics card
in so we are going to investigate first
off with the 1060 now we're going to try
a reference model of course because
anything else would just be dumping heat
in such a small form-factor it's kind of
working like a sarcophagus and we don't
want that to happen the only areas of
airflow seems to be at the top and at
the bottom of the case so it's really
not looking that good but for instance
if we can remove this plastic shroud as
well we may be able to get airflow going
to the CPU a little bit better I 3 using
less power as we've said before and a
1060 and that would make a good gaming
combo the small form factor of this case
is pretty appealing to so let's get on
with this but you may also notice on the
desk key we've got another video coming
that'll be a tech yes hurricane lot of
you guys in the comments are asking for
some tech yes love and hey loving for
days here go out of guys
you get a hot for me all right so we
tried this and this is just not gonna
fit at all that was just wishful
thinking but at least with AV Jennings
and you if you're gonna buy some real
estate then this is the stuff that
dreams are made of
so this grabs cards out of the picture
now let's try a gtx 1066 gigabyte but a
smaller one so I do have an arrow but
problem is it's not a reference like
this but we'll give it a shot anyway
because I haven't done something like
this the whole time I've been built
building pcs sure I've cut myself but
not this bad so lesson learned in point
always used the pliers on sharp things
anyway back to it also if companies are
looking like final Mouse for example for
a special blood-spattered Edition Mouse
at contact me hit me up
so we've now booted up the Alienware PC
and we've got the side panel off because
I actually had to reset the CMOS to get
it to boot off the gravity art
essentially but we also changed the RAM
and the CPU so it was a good thing to do
that but now we're going to boot up a
unity in heaven and run that for a good
10 minutes and then after that we're
gonna put the side panel on and see how
much of a difference it makes I've got
some hopeful feelings that this will
actually work out ok because when I did
the data vac I blew out a lot of dust
especially out of the front here and
there's actually a little fan that gives
air to the graphics card so CPU being
the i3 as I said before should be
absolutely fine I'm looking forward to
some good results here so it's currently
26 degrees in here I actually had a lot
of trouble setting this up initially
Windows wouldn't let the Nvidia drivers
install I just put it down to a bad
install of Windows so I completely
reinstalled Windows after it tried to
update beforehand and now everything's
working after a fresh install and we can
see here after running this for about 40
minutes with the actual side panel off
we are getting around 82 degrees so our
stock setting it is looking like it's
thermal throttling however it doesn't
look like it's thermal throttling that
much the GPU percentage is still up near
100% so we're gonna do now is we're
actually gonna run a benchmark and see
the score and then we're gonna put the
side panel on run it for 40 minutes
again and then run the benchmark again
and compare the before and after numbers
and that'll tell us how much the side
panel on is affecting it versus off of
course in an ideal world would just have
it out of this sort of sarcophagus
design but it's 26 degrees ambient so it
is a little bit hotter it is warming up
here and on the Gold Coast so let's
check out the score and then check out
the side panel on so finished up the
test this is with the side panel on now
the graph scott is noticeably louder the
cpu is noticeably hotter as well that
went from 60 low 60 degrees to now mid
70s gravis card is running near 90
degrees it's actually hitting 90 degrees
at times but surprisingly I thought it
was thermal throttling because I thought
was a temp limit at least based on these
gravis cards at 82 degrees but I was
wrong and it actually hasn't throttled
at all going all the way up to 90
degrees still the scores I've ran three
runs both after the side panels on it
before and they're pretty similar the
scores are pretty similar it is a little
bit better with the side panel off but I
think we can jump on to a conclusion now
with our little Alienware friend so here
we are and yeah I got the busted up
thumbs it hurts don't worry but we got
the Alienware our 3 desktop it's tested
and it had originally had a 6700 in it
the i7 and I didn't even know originally
what graphics card hasn't there but
there was 2 6 pins left over so we're
easily using less power than the
previous setup then this thing comes out
of the box with so it's not a healthy
scenario and the graphics cards hitting
90 degrees so I don't know what's going
on here but since the Alienware itself
it does look good it's got the RGB bling
it's got the small form factor I just
think if I gotta flip this I'm gonna
definitely tell the person it comes to
pick it up look you might want to leave
the side panel off definitely in the
summer but when it comes to the winter
it should be ok I mean the graphics card
itself was hitting max 93% fan speeds
and it's still hitting 90 degrees so
it's not a healthy long-term thing but
surprisingly nothing was throttling the
benchmarks in heaven still ran fine
before and after and it seems to be the
i3 with the 1066 gigabyte is the max
that you'd want to put inside this small
form-factor case sure I could go put
some speed holes in the side and start
hacking up the case but then whoever
wants to buy it for the looks and the
small form-factor is then going to lose
that appeal and it's going to turn into
a typical techie ass hack job with the
lower end builds but since this sort of
doesn't have that lower end appeal to it
I do want to keep it the way it is sort
of so a little bit of a weird
predicament I'd love to hear your
thoughts in the comments about this
build itself this desktop and what I
should do I mean I do like the small
form factor of it I do like
look I just am not really liking those
temperatures both even on the CPU the i3
I mean heavens not particularly a CPU
intense bench market it's still getting
75 degrees so kind of seems like a bit
of a toaster oven going on inside but
regardless that still does work but the
best thing to come out of this deal is
that we've pulled out now a 6700 we've
got 16 gigabytes of RAM and we can put
that in with a motherboard and it should
be really good in another bill but say a
1070 eye or something so that's the
beauty of sort of mixing and matching
parts if you get a few builds on hand
you can then mix and match and start
piecing together the best value systems
at different price points I thought damn
6700 with 16 gigabytes of RAM is
starting to look pretty good
so definitely made some value out of
this bill but as I said before I'm
surprised it was a 67 hundred and a more
power consuming gravis card in there
beforehand and of course we picked this
build up for five hundred Aussie dollars
and we've added a 1060 in which I got
for $240 so that leaves us with a price
tag of 740 but I'm probably gonna ask
around $7.99 for it and keep in mind we
have taken out the i7 but also taken out
16 bytes of RAM and we replaced it with
an i3 and also a gigabytes of RAM so
that's the main appeal out of picking up
this deal right here and also in
relation to the thumb I mean just it's
just one of those freak accidents that
happens that thing that I took off did
help the graphics card fit and I have
had this problem in the past with those
little silver brackets do cause problems
with fitting graphics cards at least
perfectly and just making an easy fit
and so I usually just ripped them out
but this one was so sharp and it was
like one of those things where the force
just suddenly broke and then like my
fingers sort of went back and yet I
don't know I don't know again definitely
when it comes to things that even could
be really shocked and I'm gonna proceed
with a pair of pliers I've learned my
lesson don't worry
also a big shout-out to dr. Nelson down
the road is just I walked in there he
stitched me up straight away like so
quick so efficient really good job on
fixing my thumb up really quickly like I
was surprised I was like wow I'm gonna
be out of I
for a while but no he just stitched me
up and sure it does hurt like it hurts a
lot even now like throbbing pain but
yeah I can still work still get that
grind going baby yeah
every guys hope you enjoyed today's
video if you did then be sure to slap
that like button with a normal thumb
hopefully you're not sporting a thumb
like I've got here but we've got a on
the desk a heap of deals from PCs and
we're gonna be doing a tech yes
hurricane so stay tuned for that and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon and also make sure you get
your tech yes loving in the comments and
if you want to check out some of the new
merch I'll put the link for that in the
description below not actually wearing
it right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
