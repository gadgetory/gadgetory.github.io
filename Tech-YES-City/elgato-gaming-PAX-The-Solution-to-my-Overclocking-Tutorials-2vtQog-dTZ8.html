and we are joined by Jeff Stegner and
he's actually going to alleviate a big
problem that I personally have as a
youtuber and especially doing those
overclocking tutorials for you guys and
that is when I'm in the bios i'm using
my capture on my cameron you know a lot
of people can constantly complaining
about moyer the picture looks crap i
can't read the text and now oh god oh
definitely have a solution they can
explain as well in this video how it
actually works which is something that
I've never really looked into how the
capture card does work and how you can
alleviate that problem so essentially
you've got the one monitor year that's
got the boss on it and then you have
that output yeah so basically we're
showing off a dual PC stream setup here
and the basic premise of it is you have
a gaming PC outputting HDMI into the
input of the capture card that's in
another pc now both of them are running
windows in this scenario but in your
situation with the bios that first pc
that's outputting hdmi doesn't need to
be running windows because the second
one is so the second one has like the
well in our case it's an internal but if
you have a USB capture card that can be
plugged into your recording or streaming
computer and then you can have the
computer of the subject of your video
that you need to go in the bio sub that
doesn't need to be recording windows so
you can do it without needing to point a
camera at your at your monitor that's a
USB output from the capture card going
strange that other computer so you will
need two computers but the same time you
can get that boss picture they're
recorded properly without all those
glitches and stuff that it would be
otherwise introduced from the camera so
that's one problem solved definitely
from getting an al-qaida kash guard I'm
going to be getting one of these things
and I'm going to be actually doing
proper overclocking tutorials from here
on in so stay tuned for that but also
another thing as well you guys
innovating with the software and
especially focusing on the dual monitor
setup here as I can see around the
booths here yeah i mean the dual monitor
setup is
crucial because you can have your stream
and everything that you need to focus on
on one monitor and then you can actually
play the games on the other so it's
basically a necessity nowadays but you
know as far as software goes at this
event we just released our 3.5 software
which it has a couple of really great
features for streamers we have text and
video overlays now so now you can add
video clips or text files you can type
texts right on top of our software to
add your stream so you can put labels
for graphics and everything on there and
then it also supports facebook streaming
and reece restream streaming everybody's
loving it so you definitely get that
fancy looked at a lot of those switch
stream is it getting with those fancy
overlays and whatnot the software allows
that to happen a lot easier than
otherwise manually putting it into some
other software yeah exactly because one
of the most common questions that we
have our why do I need a capture card
win the xbox one of the ps4 have some
built-in recording options and besides
the limitations of how long you can
record or you know yeah just or how easy
it is the quality is just not there and
you can't put in webcam you can't you
can't put in graphics and that's really
what sets yourself apart from everybody
if you know if there are millions of
xboxes out there and everybody's
streaming the same content how do you
differentiate yourself the market
becomes saturated so everybody's looking
for that one up and being able to
interact with your fans that's what the
webcam is for they want to see they want
to identify with you and that's what's
going to help you do that and you need a
capture card for that definitely to take
a lot of load off off the machine that's
actually streaming with the built-in
streaming software like the consoles but
the PC definitely solving a big problem
of mine and thank you very much Jeff is
great to see on a lot of people who are
doing overclocking tutorials like myself
will definitely be looking into getting
a capture card as it will alleviate that
problem and thank you guys again once
input for tuning into this video if you
have any questions about the elgato
capture cards or about the software i
mean i've got a question before we head
out and that was in the future you guys
looking to plan to get into a fork a
capture card and whatnot so that's
definitely something that beyond a lot
of people's minds definitely moving into
4k me myself producing 4k content want
to get those overclocking jewels out in
4k would that be something on your
I mean yeah I mean if you're a capture
card company it's the consoles are
moving in that direction so you wanna
you want to move the way that the
markets moving so I mean without any
kind of specifics it's just like you
want to stay up to date so all I can say
is we're not just resting on our behinds
we're looking at making the best
products out there to make the best
experience possible for all content
creators whether you're recording or
streaming thank you and guys if you got
any questions or comments for either of
us then please drop a comment the
