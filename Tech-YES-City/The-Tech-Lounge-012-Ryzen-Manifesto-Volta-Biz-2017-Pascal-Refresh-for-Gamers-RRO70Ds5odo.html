welcome back to episode 12 of the tech
lounge and I'm joined here by kev from
tech show down how you don't care I'm
doing great Brian how about you really
good man really good we've got the used
parts i spent the whole weekend doing
Jews parts think the people loved it
people will like the lovin that like I
want more of this but I was going to
finish this thing yesterday but ran some
hydro technical difficulties so yeah
well armed I'll fix that up later but
I've got all the benchmarking done on
that rig so I'm just going to make the
video actually got to cut a double the
benchmarking stuff we have the g 3258
and a gtx 770 Brian just one sec ah my
webcam is not showing up on the stream
Oh some recent yeah it's up in mind yeah
okay that is really odd the windows
missing you might need to add it in to
exploit or it's not being yeah you're up
yeah it's so good my bad that was that
was my bad oops so there that's all good
it was a ghost now he's alive no I bet
yes sir yeah anyway how you doing man
yeah no I'm good bro um yeah just being
cranking out all the key be like videos
this week and and doing a lot so that's
been really fun and done my first nvidia
series video where i did a the gtx 1060
1070 1080 and gears of war 4 and went
through the specific settings you should
set the game at for the best gaming
experience at 1080p 1440p and 4k yep so
that was quite fun it's a pretty beast
of a game though like even at 4k trying
to get 60 frames with a 1080i you have
to turn down some of the settings it's
quite a beast even with the tenor yeah
yeah yeah if you sit at ultra 1080 get
about 48 frames average I could have to
turn every drop off the filters and
other things to help it a little bit I
thought the Beast will south or 1080 was
the be all and end all I thought it
could just you had to you can max all
the sliders and just forget about life
there's another
okay miss maybe when we get in a TTI
that'll be the case but now it seems
like whenever you get these newer GPUs
that are so powerful the newer games
that come out are just so much more
difficult to run that it's sort of like
a constant evolving thing but yeah and I
checked out your samsung monitor video
and I thought that was pretty awesome so
what made it so good man is that those
it is those LEDs like no okay well think
about the ultra wide right you've got
the ultra wide day you've got the
hundred Hertz panel you've got all that
you know fast it's a fast VA panel like
it's a responsive the amplified pretty
damn low but the thing that made it is
those cutie LEDs like that thing you
know you notice it straight away like
being me having testing a ccfl monitor
you know when I had that when I was
doing all those benchmark builds in in
Japan I had that ccfl 1080p monitor now
you know the funny thing is this is when
I really just started i get i started
getting fed up like i've got a fire got
a 4k monitor I've got a 1440 be monitor
and they're white LED backlit then I've
got the ccfl that little 1080p from 2008
a subpanel I started playing games on
this thing and I was just like you know
wow this is really good you know you
just it for some reason it seems sharper
the details there yeah you're green your
Reds they're popping more than they
would on a 4k TN panel with white LED
backlighting so when I got the QT LED
and I knew exactly what to look for you
know with your own two eyes instead of
instead of having someone go out there
and tell you oh my god I've got this
machine that is nowhere near what a
human eye is but you can't compare a
machine to a human eye and the Machine
spinning out numbers yeah okay yeah well
what is that you know biological eyes
are made up a lot differently to these
machines so mmm yeah you know you got to
look at just use your own two eyes and
say is this a good product and the CF
791 man phenomenal you know I bought it
myself so people can't call me the
sellout and all this I went on
ebay and border myself for a thousand
bucks because I wanted and back lane
white LEDs are a scourge on our eyes
they're terrible you know they should
yeah we got we got shafted the whole
tech industry has been shafted but no
one goes on about it but me I'm the only
guy seems to go on about it but I don't
know maybe I just appreciate my vision I
don't really know what it is so you know
I even imagined a I couldn't imagine
life without my vision so you know take
care of your eyes guys take care of your
eyes go watch the video I sort of not
just I don't just praise the QT LED
backlit monitor I also talked about why
it's good why you should be getting out
why you should be getting anything but
white LEDs even go out and buy a
second-hand ccfl backlit monitor test it
yourselves yeah there's actually not
that bad price-wise I mean like it's
what do you say it's about a thousand
USD which is it us I mean it is
expensive some people don't it is
expensive for a monitor but in when you
compare it to all the other ultra lights
that's about middle of the road eh
that's not even like Heinz in terms of
the ultra wide market I'm seeing plenty
that go up higher than that yep and
that's that's exactly right it's got ya
and then it's got 100 Hertz and AMD
freesync but let me know I'm not really
buying for that I you know I'm on this
thing so many hours of the day and its
productivity yet that I'm concerned with
and yeah my eyes are already getting
treated you probably notice my eyes are
like why don't why don't like yeah I can
see like that Josh I was happy to mannys
you know he can look at QT LEDs as well
so everyone's happy around everyone is
over the moon then I watched the test
last night and Elvis Federer oh my god
what a match what a match tennis I don't
know tennis is really popular and I was
I don't know why so I guess it's a
little small yeah I just huge man nadal
vs federer is like a dream final and you
know Federer okay good on it so yeah
those yeah so kewt LEDs guys it's legit
it's hopefully it's rolled out in more
our budget monitors like 1080p 1440p you
hopefully it's rolled out some of those
more budget options even 60 Hertz
because yet which we have to start
getting better technology in a Mon
then white LEDs yeah exactly terrible
you know they're terrible yeah I mean I
noticed straight away with my eyes I can
see you know detail way way better so
okay I know now so what that noise is
it's like you know every time I know
it's on my and man is the real I like em
like every time this is this is true
story every time I go to film every time
I could do something there's always that
sets yeah you make sure you pick first
man I see as you start it's I did quiet
and then you sit down you're like a
standing start filming and as soon as
you do it's like someone starts a lawn
mower or something your heart yeah yeah
this is it like no budget and my brother
he is where he's witness to it sometimes
as well well it'll be it'll be pitch
quiet for two hours I go to start
filming Donald everything 20 cars drive
by but guys doing burnouts it's stupid
like now yeah so we'll go move on to the
first topic and then I'll go figure out
what this noises it's ridiculous because
it's probably yeah that's a guy can I
cottage they're actually just stopped in
thank God so we're gonna hear the first
topic we're going to move on here and
video volts are allegedly launching in
2017 12 Nana me just been fed technology
this is pretty huge what do you think
about this I mean it looks it would eat
me by surprise say like I I could
understand I mean if it went by the
body's saying 2017 I expect it to be at
the very end would you not expect it
around like october november type time
that's when I would expect it anyways
but um yeah I it just kind of takes me a
little bit by surprise it does a were
damn well what do what W CCF is saying
this is why I pulled up the article it's
not like your typical oh my god this is
going to be the best thing ever it's
going to change your life what they're
kind of saying is that they're going to
release it on the business end the 12
nanometer on the business end and then
they're going to refresh maxwell for the
gaming lineup and that kind of makes
sense i mean because amy haven't even
got there gtx
any competitor out yet so you know in
video of like wall that's are indeed
cash we can just refresh a whole nother
year with better clock speeds maybe a
few more cuda cores on the don 27t so
they've got some options there and i
think that's what they're going to do
they're going to roll this year with the
maxwell refresh but that's that's what
they're basically saying in this article
so uggh yeah yeah yeah that's what it
sort of seems like they're saying yeah I
would yeah I would imagine that would be
kind of the case but I think as I said
so many times nvidia the these types
articles are cool to read but Nvidia
going to be playing this extremely
reactionary they're going to be watching
see what AMD does with Vega and
depending on how that goes that will
basically determine what they release
and when they release it so I would
imagine they're going to wait till Vega
comes out and then the 1080 TI will come
out which will be very similar to the
tyne XP and then that will those will
fight it out for a little while but
right now if you think about it from
invidious perspective I mean they're
making they've got the entire high-end
GPU market to themselves so why would
they release anything people are still
buying sin 80s people are still buying
10 70s and 10 60s Intel all over again
2006 Intel all over again I just taken
the laser take it they've taken the lead
and then all they're doing with it is
they've taken the lead and all they're
doing with it is basically rolling and
saying hey we've got the lead we're
going to make profit off it now so made
from and you get like I mean you can't
blame them though that's the thing you
can't blame them for running a business
so I just wish you know aimed you get
their cards out they compete they bring
the competition and they bring it hard
that's all I want so but as far as yeah
yeah exactly the good thing is we may
even see a 26 TTI as well that's pretty
cool yet there there might be something
like that and by the way guys in chat
Brian meant Pascal not Maxwell so are
you freaking out these are pretty you
guys you guys it's it's funny a like we
do so many tech reviews that a lot of
times things blur together but that's
not to say it's just that all the
different names for things because we
have to cover so much you can it can
blur together sometimes so yeah I can
make mistakes like that well took me to
eat so technically Pascal is just
Maxwell on roids that's all with higher
clock smack so there's not much of a
difference there anyways but yeah sorry
mum yeah but they're saying they're
saying in the article though that most
likely and this is what a lot of people
saying they're most likely will be like
a Pascal refresh yeah before you see
Volta and I think that's pretty yeah
pretty consistent so you'll see
something like that I believe with more
upgraded memory and other things like
that to higher clock speeds what do you
guys think of the chat you think we're
going to get this I think we're gonna
get served in 2017 a refresh that's what
I think we're yet so I just don't see
why they would ever unless Vega is just
like absolutely smashes and video in
terms of their cards and in terms of
price of performance then I think they
might get desperate and really something
they bring out otherwise otherwise I
think they'll just sit on their hands
but yeah if it smashes them then maybe
they'll you know maybe skip the Pascal
refresh and jump straight to vault or
something like that just take a do catch
back up but I highly doubt that would be
the case like there's like a five
percent chance that's the case alrighty
will otherwise smashing out these Pascal
refreshes so there's actually i'll do
cruising through wccftech news and
they've got a good article here about
invidious interests and the founders
edition cards it's growing yeah it's
going to continue to grow the atom board
partners are kind of getting pissed off
because that's out there really I'm
happy with that yeah and so Nvidia's
like well because it's so you know it's
actually a big market like they're
getting millions and millions in profit
hundreds of millions it's a profitable
market nvidia like well we can just
start doing that too so basically the
articles a little bit it doesn't really
post any figures
but it is something to think about like
the board partners and that's why I
think in this case sort of MSI AMD
gigabyte and stuff who play both swing
both ways they're kind of in a good
position where they can sort of just
pick up and make more AMD cards but I
feel sorry for like EVGA and you know
obviously like zotac the guys who are
you know nvidia or only and you know
that young and they can't do anything
about it what's what's your opinion
they're like you know that I feel sorry
for these guys is their whole line of
business and invidi is just coming in
saying okay we're gonna do what we want
and we're gonna take away your business
which you know yeah loyal service we
don't care yeah no no I get that um I
mean the founders edition themselves
shouldn't I don't know a single person
actually owns one because a they're more
expensive they usually come in a higher
than well at least they did for the 1070
1080 it was only just because nvidia has
a monopoly early on that was about the
only one you could get be yeah i could
understand whether Adam partners Adam
board partners and stuff are upset
because it is nvidia selling something
directly instead of going through the
different companies um but i think it
only does well for them at the start
because they release the graphics card
and just a sec then right what's up
you're right it's like right when you
start streaming some dude gets out like
I even know what it is it's like a
whistle like he's got this whistle and
it's just late without the front of like
out front of my door okay so I'm just
like troll this close slam the door of
course i will start sweating a little
bit but you know sure you don't mind huh
oh you can take your shirt off in the
views to get through the roof yeah but
ya know as I was saying I think honestly
I'm when it comes down the founders
edition i think the board partners might
get a bit grumpy but i honestly don't
think it probably impacts them that much
it's just when it first is released the
real people that are super hyped will
buy the card which will most likely be a
founders because there's nothing else to
buy and then over I mean like I was
watching playtex a section on graphics
cards we can buy them and it was only
for about the first few months that you
could get a pair founders edition and
then they disappeared off the website
give although already though holding a
monopoly man like does the thing they're
if they're setting back the custom
designs a couple of months and they're
just releasing their founders edition
exclusive for a couple of weeks or a
month or whatever so it's kind of it's
annoying that I doing that just to drive
sales to their own brand but especially
when something else has been in place
sort of like an agreements been in place
for years and years beforehand but yeah
yeah it's just sad to see the industry
go this way AMD well it is to a certain
perspective but I mean AMD sort of I
don't know i mean like yeah Andy has
sapphire so in a lot of ways they're
kind of doing it already to a certain
degree with the fact that they own one
of the companies
yeah that distribute their GPU so they
sort of do it but in an indirect kind of
way yes true so all right well this is
the next article got up here as Zeus is
announcing the designer curve MX 34 VQ
now it's kind of making news but that's
the thing right I looked straight away
it doesn't have QT LEDs in the back and
that's what I asked myself they sort of
alluding to live alluding to what you
know backlighting it actually has but
just looks like it's got white LEDs in
the back so as I mainly I'm going to be
making a big focus now on high-end
monitors if they're coming out if I am
monitors are going to start being
released and they need high-end
backlighting that's my or at least
something better than the lowest of the
low back lighting so I mean the specs
look really good you got 34 inch got
1,800 I curvature apparently home
theater quality audio but is this panel
is it going to hit the market and have
you know that awesome backlighting is
going to have something different to
white LEDs yeah and I I'd say no because
they've got a zoo psych air here and you
know essentially just does what flux
does can drop the blue line give you a
warm you know orange sort of tinted
picture but that's really only for
nighttime use when you want to get to
bed so yeah no other than that goes
that's the zoo says anyone waiting for
the design Oh curve oh yeah beautifully
interestingness you guys do you like um
officiated burner the Dino good t know
yeah debian yeah okay yeah that won't be
right ah the i was wondering if you guys
in chat like do you guys enjoy altra
wide Steve would be something you would
buy or would you just prefer a more
standard screen you know like a normal
4k 28 inch monitor would you like to go
for one of these like this one a 34 inch
3440 x 1440 I think I think that's the
thing with ultra wats to write DD have
you seen the 29 inches like they are you
know I would rather get a cheap Korean
27 inch monitor
then the 21 29 inch was you know like I
put my hand like my hands 20 centimeters
i'm a 34 inch here it probably takes
almost two hands on a 29 inch for some
reason my hand can almost fit the whole
like a height of the 29 inch monitor
like it they're ridiculously i think the
tool a shallow they're not tall enough
and that's that's my great with the 29
inches I think you're better off just
because they're about whatever they
might be two hundred bucks sometimes I'd
say you better off getting that Korean
1440p 27-inch but now 1440p ones the big
34 inch 35 inches they're the ones that
are really damn good they really give
you a good extinct you they open up your
eyes do you like wow this thing is
actually pretty freaking awesome on your
desk yeah exactly that's what's my
opinion with it um I think you'll start
seeing a lot more I agree especially if
you're buying if you go and spend a
couple of thousand bucks on a rig think
about you monitor as well so yeah it's
so overlooked and I think the main thing
is say I think you would agree with this
you pretty much in my point of view I
wouldn't go to an ultra-wide if it was
one of the 1080p ones on that you're
seeing like the 2560 x 1080 I think you
pretty much have to go to that 3440 by
1440p yeah that's really really nice do
you get the nice resolution and a nice
sort of screen real estate with you with
that one then you get the refresh rate
throwing in there as a bonus like 100
Hertz for me it's just perfect oh oh
yeah that's great yeah and then of
course hey guys the Zeus they're
announcing the Dino the Dino curve Dean
yeah I don't know it's coming out
apparently 750 pounds 20th of march so
if you're looking for the Dino just have
to get your razor out and scrub out the
sick and the and that's it yeah you get
the don't way that would make it the
dinner alright so we got a seagate
blends to release a 16 terabyte hard
drive next year like 16 terabytes are
you freaking kidding me on a mechanical
drive five hundred and forty bucks to
the price wait that's not the price of
it
the last year's 10 terre by model but
you can spected to be around a similar
price but things right thing is would
you in all honesty would you have one
mechanical drive with 16 terabytes on
there well I'm not sure how well is this
really aimed at the consumer market or
is this aimed at the industry I aimed at
people who want 16 terabytes on a
mechanical drive like yeah I suppose
here i mean the there was talk of even
bigger coming sometime soon 20 terabyte
but I yeah that's I don't know i i'd
rather get this uh I i I'd know I I
don't think I'd want to risk everything
on one drive like that all my mass
storage um it's better to maybe spread
out I mean you could fit you know if
you're running a Nass then yeah this
will probably have a place in there yeah
people running their home networks yeah
that would I mean that's probably what
it's been made for actually so then it
would probably be all right if you had a
few of them in there yeah ah but yeah
for average user I'm not so sure was the
thing I think three or four terabytes is
kind of like where you're going to top
off for me personally like I wouldn't
want any more space on my hard drives
that thing fails man it's like okay
there's there's like a couple of days
just wasted because you have to back up
and get a new 16 terabyte hard drive you
have to fill it up with all the data
problems we're getting that six because
you know you're gonna have to return and
get that thing warranted because
freaking 16 terabytes going to see you
back a lot of money so yeah three of
them yeah I got the moment I've got a
busted 3 terabyte western digital drive
oh my god first this is my first
experience where I had a dead Western to
a 3 terabyte hard drive that's why I was
telling people about the heat this thing
died in the summer this thing down the
dead heat of summer man I was like a 34
degree day and I'm like copping like my
other hard drive all the contents from
that drive over to this Drive and the
thing like it just got too hot man it's
just too hot in the drive just shout
itself so now it's bastard but he will
kill hard drives like especially
mechanical drives guys if you got
mechanical drives in especially in
summer give them a fan they deserve a
fan they need a family and that fanboy
is a fan so give him a fan and they
should be okay I didn't but it's still
under warranty so I'm going to get it
replaced that yeah just the heat kill
these things man yeah and I mean I
tested the windows to make you like
testing yep the Playtex rogue system and
that had no drives in it like no dry
baits and no obstacle drives or anything
and it just had the single m2 or 512
good one yep and that that's pretty sexy
a I really like how clean it looks man
like inside the system so i think maybe
that'll be the way for it if they start
releasing you know m dot tues for
cheaper with larger sizes i think
that'll be the way the future people
would just want run any sort of
mechanical or sada base drive that's
true yeah I agree yeah so next up we got
gives a war for multiplayer supports
cross-play now this is something that i
really like because gives well for is a
pretty popular game so the multiplayer
is going to support cross-play now they
sort of they don't talk about the future
of this like what games are going to
support cross-play but i'm really hoping
cod start supporting cross place so I
can just get on my P do that really make
a paddler on the pc yeah if you get on
cod and start ponent some console boys
boys yeah just get on that just get on
their stuff yeah you know really start
getting on that like start getting the
playerbase all together now one thing
I'm worried about is you know you didn't
see ps4 here so is that what is that
sort of where Microsoft's going to go
with cross player they're just going to
be like all right xbox one and pc only I
think that's something you're going to
see even if the game is on PlayStation 4
I think that's something you're going to
see is sort of Microsoft's all right
well forget about playstation 4 we're
going to make sure this game works with
our PC users at I xbox one user base
yeah because they are focusing on where
she should have pulled that article
but apparently the project scorpia is
going to be a really powerful console
there you go they're putting their heads
to work they're gonna make a really
awful console yeah like apparel is going
to be insanely fast that'll be good news
because people will be like okay well
get on project Scorpio and there's cross
play with PC I can play with my mates
you know even though I've got my might
cut my true colors are console I'm a
console fanboy blah blah blah my friends
are PC fanboys and there's no problem
yeah we're going to be able to cross
play on our favorite games so I think
that's something that Microsoft really
is focusing on and as long as good for
the community especially pc users
because then we've got more players to
play against exactly yeah kind of suck
if they're going to sort of go
exclusivity with this and Sean
PlayStation users well I'm really care
being on PCs because you know more of
anything sped off so yeah yeah but yeah
I feel sorry for people on PlayStation
if this is the route they're going to
take what do you think about the cross
Blake if I do it'll yeah it's going to
happen more and more we're already
seeing it happen more and more so um
yeah I know I'd see it as a good thing
obviously more people playing better you
know why would I have a problem with it
you're gonna have I mean there's this
sort of people say about like sort of
balance issues regarding it but ya know
hard in our heads you know that's a men
in social console peeps are telling me
that control is way better than that
keyboard mouse my brother tells me this
I'm like really you for real dope I
don't I don't agree with that you for
real body fat but I'm yeah I think it's
yeah that I independently game i think
in first-person shooters it's pretty you
know fair for the most part but maybe in
other types of games um that wouldn't
really work i I think it'll work in
anything to be honest especially racing
car games I'd be really cool a racing
game yeah that would work yeah because
that's a they probably if they advantage
of it that's well that's where I use a
controller is the racing games on their
awesome for racing games racing sims so
yeah
that's it gives a well gives it gives a
will you artificial intelligence can
splice skincare now this is important i
pulled this up because Ozzie's get a lot
of legal I think we'd like one of the
highest nations in the world gets skin
cancer but I'll surprise people in the
States every year there's 5.1 million
new cases of skin cancer in the United
States that's pretty freaking huge I
mean I know their populations not big
but there's still a lot of cases of skin
cancer every year so apparently they've
developed this AI algorithm and it's got
Leah deep learning so it'll just scan
through a hundred and thirty thousand
images of skin cancer and now apparently
it's really accurate like after they did
that they then did test subjects and
ninety-six percent of the time this
thing was on the money and spotting out
malignant samples and ninety percent of
the time just said okay that's harmless
so it's pretty accurate and now they
ragged what they think with this article
it's really good is they think you can
actually put this on a smartphone in the
future in a way you know you just scan
yourself like have a look and tell me
what you think ai and the AI be like
well you got to get that checked
out that's pretty cool yeah like that
means that's good thing for Australians
here I'll pull away this picture pretty
drop you know the viewers would be like
get that off the screen I could
completely agree yeah what about New
Zealand you have any problems with skin
cancer uh yeah we do yeah well ins got
big problems of it as well because of
the UV race we get so much yeah here
through that killers man you outside and
just do skip burnt instantly I'll see
it's bad but it's not as bad as here oh
really damn so there we go you could use
a I algorithms you could use this
instead of going to it instead of going
to a doctor you know look I'm guilty
over to it you ever guilty of just going
on google and being like I pathing up
what could it be and then it says like
go see a doctor immediately okay I'll
guess I'll go see a doctor immediately
but i kinda want some so at reassurance
that this is an eye cancer a zombie
autonomy so yeah symptoms of i can sir
you know I'm hypochondriac I think they
call it that yeah hypochondriac people
who worry about hyper country is a
person that yang says sick all the time
you know you're only an actual hyper
contract if you're like constantly going
to the doctor oh yeah thinking you've
got something bad random but yeah have
you ever met a hypochondriac ah yeah you
how used to know yeah true story again
so we gotta have windows moving on to
the next topic we've got windows 10
creators previews out so I think I their
game mode they got streaming they've
also got a cool feature here built in
flux essentially that's really cool
because now you know now I cannot
install flux and have one less app in
the program but it's kind of sucks
because flux has always been awesome but
you can actually change a color
temperature night and you can have it so
it automatically does it all for you but
it's going to be sad to see flocks go
flux has been part of my life you know
for the last couple years it's been a
really good program if you guys aren't
using flux and you're on a white LED
backlit monitor go download it seriously
go download flocks now install it and
you'll be sleeping better at night well
unless you've got blue laser glasses so
go do it right Gunners yeah exactly yeah
yeah and that's that's nothing so they
got that built in the game modes still
still ambiguous man I mean apparently
like one guy in the comments like he
lost a ton of frames his gears of war
went down from 100 from 140 down to 70
things are broken so apparently he isn't
working properly i don't know what is
game mode is it just apparently this
gives exclusivity to the game or
whatever and i don't know it will just
stop everything going on on the
background that doesn't really need to
be going on yeah well um yeah then they
got useless streaming feature i mean if
you're streaming you're going to be
still using your whatever xsplit or
you're going to be using OBS it's going
to be using the programs and you're
using because you trust them and you
know how they work yeah yeah yeah I'm
actually sort of i was a little bit
hyped for this but after seeing and i'm
not too hyped except for the I inbuilt
flux that's that's pretty hype I mean
it's still a while off yet though isn't
all eyes
they win so rolling it out like they're
rolling a review yeah yeah preview yeah
but they could make study they'll
probably still make a few changes here
and there before actually goes low for
the rest of us that role in an hour
brother that's what they're doing right
now you getting excited man you're
getting excited for Windows 10 creators
building it next article we got it
Angele Angele announces their full wrap
their full revenues so the ops 70s sent
from 2015 results like are you kidding
me they're up it's amazing either they
can still keep going up I mean I be
other areas well I'm really surprised
that they went up like that's that's
something that's kind of shocked me
because we've sort of had nothing but
hashtag rehash you know 2016 and stuff
like that but of course there's their
server the server industry is really
strong I you can see there's like you
know their revenues up Simpson so 17.2
do a billion from 16 billion a year ago
so so that's the data group center you
see yeah that's what spawn them on yet
their business sectors doing really well
yeah so it's all this all the stuff that
we really don't hear about is up which
is good because then you know it
consumer products and server products
kind of go hand in hand right you know
you can shoot to a certain picture yeah
yeah because you know you always going
to get the speedy consumer price
generally generally once upon a time
there just spin-offs of the business the
business stuff was the cream of the crop
then the consumers got all the all the
drakes kind of thing yeah I mean it's
kinda like it's gonna let your friend
giving you that lost ten percent of his
gatorade or whatever you like home here
Thursday man physio I want to treat that
maze like it might have back well yeah
it's doesn't matter talk about it back
watching it you know you're still
getting a you're still getting the
Gatorade but you just you might have a
bit of back washing in whatever this is
exactly what's going on here consumers
we get in the back wash so but it's good
backwash you know 58 20k that was good
backwash g45 y ax t there's some good
backwash coming out at the moment so
this is a good stuff coming out what do
you think that what do you think well
it's interesting because it says their
desktop platform volume was down nine
percent there you go so no more volumes
remain flat so that it is just this
business section with their servers and
stuff like that it's cam and other stuff
and all the data stuff here that'll be
doing pulling them up which is what a
lot of us expected what they say yeah
yes there's a client computing group as
well that's up two percent so it's
everything to do with non US mainstream
gamers and whatever and and yeah it's
everything but enthusiasts is up and so
that's sort of carrying the whole thing
up its carrying the whole statistic up
yeah like I said nine percent downs like
damn that's a bad statistic so desktop
platform volume was down nine cents like
damn that's that's pretty big news so
yeah everyone's waiting on business
everyone's waiting for Zen but I guess
intelligence doesn't care that's pretty
much in a nutshell yeah because they
don't have to care because it's like
yeah the down nine percent I just really
don't care because it's not affecting
their business their main chunk of their
businesses the server market you know
died um yeah exactly so this is where is
that so yeah if they'll still be sitting
pretty I mean there are with ricin there
are going to be CPUs made for survey use
which we've discussed previously yeah so
it's not like AMD is going to completely
leave until to that area they are going
to attempt to halt some of that money
away from them I haven't pulled up the
manifesto you I'm going to pull up the
manifesto right now so this is anas the
manifest NFS start yeah that's it we're
gonna pull up that hey come on man we're
going with an oath theme today we got
the Azuki you get these Zeus Dino we got
the manifesto yeah
so what we go here is this is actually
really cool eh I'm kind of surprised
because it's sayin that AMD summit ridge
we can have the eight core 16 thread
scoring around about 1300 in sinaa
benched if i'm reading this right i
think i think it means above 1300 by the
arrow ok this special zensah sr7 will be
above 1300 then the non special one I
wish I guess will be some different one
will be about 1300 which puts it in line
with a 6850 k but i mean i'm looking at
the one here for 350 bucks because I
mean hundred fifty dollar surcharge for
a sort of like a cherry pick sample
still gonna be a which is what I we
expect it a lot of people's there's like
the 8320 versus the 8350i would have
picked the 8320 like it offered a better
value need you take that you think Zach
you get your money you go to the casino
why do you go to the center you get a
sinner to gamble yeah it's like yeah
okay so it's like dropping forty dollars
on a hand of blackjack and you can only
win twenty dollars but you got now a
seventy-five percent chance of winning
or seventy-three percent chance what are
you going to do I'm going to play the
twenty dollars so i can double up you
know what I mean oh yeah I don't check
then you play the gamble prior go you go
to silicon lottery save 100 actually
that's not too bad i mean depends on how
much extra these clocks at these chips
these chips are clocking on average so
it depends on how much better the cherry
pick sample is over the non cherry-pick
sample but i'm loving the price of that
ecor 16 throughout a 350 bucks if that's
a reality yeah i mean that we have no
idea if this is legit or not but what I
find also interesting is n sr5 that six
core yep they're saying actually has 12
threads yes we r we we we spoke last
time about how from the information we
had then that it was looking to be a
6-core 6 threat but they're saying well
from this it looks like it's going to be
a 636 core 12 straight what's
interesting that they're saying it's
going to get a cinebench score of about
a thousand and it's going to come in at
about two hundred fifty dollars yeah if
you look down below it
the Intel lineup from Sky lake and rumor
that the difference between Scylla and
kb lake isn't very big at all IPC alone
is identical you'd see that that would
be beating a stock 6700 k it would be
yeah or over 250 bucks yeah and that's
looking really dollars less let's not
make any dollars less and I was telling
you I was hyped for the six cool a lot
of people going to be hard for that fork
or eight threads that's gonna be cool
but the six core 12 threats I think
that's what it's going to be at fig I
think that's gonna be a beast I really a
lot of people in a tech community
telling you that's the one they keep
your eye on yeah the be mentioned
coupling out with a be 350 k cuz u DX
yeah the ex 370 board you're probably
going to want to get that with an
eight-core 16 thread just because you're
going to have the extra phasers down the
vrml we'll talk about a little bit later
but six score 12 thread be 350 that
looks like it's going to be your sweet
spot even for the guys who want to go
get out a gtx 1070 and gtx 1080 or even
a vega GPU if they want to hold out this
looks like is going to be the cpu to get
on a budget if indeed that 1000
cinebench points is true for it out of
the box mmm you know if that's not true
that's like Max overclocks and geez
we're done yeah yesterday for the 600 of
a fork or can get like 1080 when it's
overclocked I still got to delete that
thing into a video but yeah well I mean
yeah I just did it the other day so a
6600 k at 4.4 gigahertz will score about
727 yeah in cinebench so and a 7600
cable score the same thing so if you
think if it's at a thousand unless
you're 6600 k or 7600 k probably
overclocks up to like 4.9 gigahertz even
then I don't think it would beat it it
wouldn't get over a thousand or you'd be
you might get up to 900
but that's a that's a tall order to beat
so if judging by that if it does get a
thousand straight out of the box then
Intel's going to be in trouble because
there's no way even a 7700 k is going to
have trouble catching up to that guy if
thats its stock speed and it overclocks
like crazy then the 7700 k will it's
done it's just I've just throw yeah just
go get a return return easy to 70
motherboard in life so what they did it
they said it here this is it this is
exactly right i just noticed it so that
shows my my numbers are correct they put
beside at 720 @ 4.5 for the 6600 k &amp;amp;
1030 at 4.7 for the 6700 k so you know
you'd maybe get a bit higher maybe get
up to 1100 if you can get your 7700 k up
to 5 gigahertz but look at how good
virus at sr5 can it go you know how
powerful is that going to be and that's
what what would it be interesting but
this is unverified so we don't know how
mmm XTC the e could stand for estimated
to and I mean there's gonna be people
like why why are we even looking at
Cinebench r15 cinebench is
single-handedly i love this benchmark I
mean look II it stresses all the threads
of ale it stresses the whole CPU can go
do it yourself pull up the whatever
media you want to watch you you hit the
start button on cinebench you'll CPUs
loaded up to one hundred percent full
loaded yep it gives you just a realistic
score of how this thing is going to
perform it's just like the physics cool
i like the physics core and fire strike
but i think that's a little bit tilted
towards hyper-threading same with this
of course I cinebench our focus is
enough interest yeah they're both tilted
towards hyper-threading but they give
you a max theoretical score that you for
multi-threaded performance but there's
more for I mean it's starting to become
more common in gaming but especially for
Poitras yeah yeah especially on the
lower end especially on the lower end
core counts that's where it's really
the max call like the you know the 10
core 23 even the eight core 16 thread
it's sort of a little bit irrelevant
especially with Adobe you know not
giving us proper freaking multi-threaded
support like yes started curve off
freaking what the hell the yeah yeah
yeahs give us the 6 quart well thread
like make it happen guys I really want
to see this 250 bucks yeah was it listen
man that's a lot of power for two
hundred fifty dollars of that if this
stays consistent it is men so guys get
hyped in the comments just in caps AMD's
back guys but with instead of spelling a
GU YS spell at GA is you know like go
for it in the comments yeah I've heard
have you heard anything more about
Rosen's release date no not yet and even
if I did okay like if I was under India
couldn't say anything either so now it's
not under well I've heard something from
the industry which i'm pretty sure i can
tell people but it may not be correct
though so there's just things i hear
from different people got um i'm pretty
sure it will be out sometime in March
apparently yeah that's when a lot of
there's a lot of chat about March with
you in terms of different dates and
stuff like I don't know if it's at the
very start or at the very end but that's
the month that I keep hearing from
people that things are expected due to a
table yes promises by different people
for different things I'll put it that
way but that's what I keep hearing March
and so that's what I think right now it
will be coming out then so much is going
to be the month where we've got
different folks for different strokes
yeah hopefully hopefully that's what
that's what it's looking at and then our
Vega is looking like it's going to be
pushed back to sort of June July type
time yeah alright so we got here next
hour biostar am for their related going
to release their x3 70s there be 350
model boards
looks I mean looks pretty good they gone
with the camo I like the camera camera
is really cool but I wait no racing flag
okay I'm looking at this class a
checkered flag yeah okay so there will
the guys I mean you get the racing chair
now you need your racing motherboard
this is don't tell me this is going to
be the 2017 by 2016 was easily the year
of RGB is 2017 to be the year of racing
like everything your sound bars gonna
have checkered flags on it your monitors
gonna have bezels like checkered flags
and you you're gonna get a condenser
microphone with like a chair racing car
spoiler like yes I mean I'm a little bit
concerned here I mean a racing
motherboard like what does it do
lady doesn't do anything wait you know
motherboards mother believes as long as
it's got a good vrm that's really yeah
like oh it's just for this is the thing
that they do I can understand why the
danica speed they put this GT I mean
there's the gt3 racing which is the
Porsche racing so maybe that's what they
were going for with their GT GT five if
she if they 7 i would pay I'd pay for
that I'd legitimately pay for this if
they could put a speaker on there and
have its own separate chip so when you
press the power button again they do
that they do that already want it must
have i've been texting their predator
when you turn it on it makes this big
growling noise um well no it needs to be
like or even start playing that shoot
when you go to turn your pc off it is
that you know that Schumacher song
Schumacher update my dad and aunt Denton
don't dance and aunt bee doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo I said if I will get it
seriously a350 b3 50s where I've been
looking I've been my eyes have been on
the be 350 since they announced it I
think it's going to be the cookie cutter
it's going to be that bored you're going
to get because this time around they're
not going to make that mistake of giving
it like the 970 boards they were
releasing some of those things
with terrible VRMs this time around I
think you're going to make a power like
this one looks like it's got a 7th phase
design we don't know what sort of MSI
and the others are doing exactly on
their VRMs yet but rest assured you're
going to see some really solid B 350s
come out and you know the best thing
about the be 350 is they've got two PCI
legacy slots on there that is so
freaking cool because I honestly I'm a
big fan of having a pci sound card over
a PCIe now got a they're cheaper be they
don't have as many problems so i think
that's cool they bring you back pci
really freaking yeah as only on the be
350 you look at the X 379 they hang up
pci so be 350 greater than symbol X 370
but I suppose you could put it that way
better the the X 370 definitely makes up
with it with that 14 face power yeah
well that's I mean that'll be the one
further serious the enthusiasts will
gravitate towards the x3 so what biostar
though for biased i mean you know i was
looking to buy 0 stars financials to
this is another thing scary fat guys
these guys were predicted to go bankrupt
already so apparently their finest was
looking pretty bad pretty bad like the
patio is something there parently got so
much debt it's not funny so yeah it's
interesting as well that we have on the
x 370 the if you skipped through the
pictures on the top one they've got the
GT seven then x 370 gt5 which is it goes
down to a seven face power as well yeah
which means just looking from the specs
they've provided there's very little
difference between that lower model x
370 and the be 350 said the fact that
it's digital power is that like is that
how they ripping a Zeus off there with
digipen because I mean like I've got a
HOA 81 m that's got dizzy power on it so
I mean we're going to see a Zeus release
some real you know a hard-hitting be 350
s like you're going to see a lot of
companies hit hard with the b3 50s it's
going to be a no brainer but
what I'm concerned is biostar is that
they can have a tough time making a name
for themselves because motherboards are
actually a pretty competitive market
Leigh yeah you've got four different
companies really gone for the desktop
market you know asrock msi gigabyte
horas now is a taurus and a zoo so why
that's there yeah yeah yeah so you've
got four companies really going hard at
it I kind of find out I see biased I
having a real tough time picking up
their brand name yeah I don't see that
going particularly well sir and plot
will plus plus if someone buys this and
they have a problem you're going to hear
about it a lot more than the other four
right because it's a new company
someone's going to be nervous about
buying it so if they buy the gigabyte
they got a prom I'll just return it it
happens if they buy the biostar and they
have a problem oh my god this new
company I've never bought anything from
had a problem vent you know so yeah yeah
I think I think it's going to be hard
for him down to the market that's all
what do you guys think in the comments
let us know in the chat so there's a lot
of you know gigabytes for life and stuff
like happen hopefully i will be though
i'm going to be focusing on the be 350
when i first get it looks like it's
going to be awesome but yet that's about
it for you guys um we got questions ah
we have one question on the form a
question for deck lounge do you think
it's going to be a common practice with
so we're going to move on to Q&amp;amp;A guys
start asking those questions go at it in
the chat I've got it's like because my
i'm using the stream of the ultra wide
right here i've got there so my head's
going to be turned to here to read the
comments a little bit sorry about that
fills just bear with me so kev will be
breeding questions too but first
question we got here on the forum so
we're going to take priority to the
forums so if you wanted to sign up to
the forums tech city TV / forum sign up
awesome place we've got awesome people
there do you think is going to be a
common practice for new or high-end in
enthusiasts intel cpus to have to deal
it'd them apply new thermal compound
before you overclock them now i think
with um x99 they're not going to do that
because x 99 s that you pay you you pay
for you pay good money for x 9
you pay it on the motherboard and you
pay it on the cpu now if you're going to
cut down on the enthusiast lineup if
you're going to cut down on that real
sort of like you can have people in
business because people in business you
know I know a lot of people who are our
necks 99 for business yeah because
that's yeah like you know that's it's
great for a single solution in your home
for whatever you're doing if you're a
photo editor photographer whatever you a
lot of people use next 99 now if you're
cutting down your skimping on that
that's going to be because you
can have that one cpu that thermal
places isn't applied properly and that
person is going to be you know throwing
rocks he's going to be livid so I don't
think will happen on s9 I'm of course
it's happened on the four cores and it's
going to keep happening on the four
course until saving money are you know
all those real enthusiasts they just
deleting the things anyway and to be
honest I think if you do a deal it I'm
going to probably just go out on a whim
here and say that I honestly think that
if you delete a chip it's actually
better than a solder make the flux the
solder because you've got that you've
got that lick especially with koolaburra
tories liquid / that stuff is amazing
you spread that on nice even layer drop
that thing back on temps are incredible
now so I mean I'm not defending yeah
like I hate the fact that their cost
cutting and it's affecting the majority
of people on for course but at the same
time if UD lid it's pretty cool if you
got the koolaburra towards liquid / on
there so I don't know I just think fish
feels like we're going backwards I mean
I thought we dealt with this in Devil's
Canyon now back at it again you know
yeah the problem is their problem is
that has will refresh they fix the
thermal paste on the house will refresh
they fixed it like it was too bad it
wasn't too bad cabbie lake it's terrible
again it's actually I think it's the
worst it's ever been yeah it's it's a
great one hundred really bad I can't
wait to get my little D lid tool because
I don't recommend doing the Vice method
on Sky lake or can be like I think the
PCBs are too thin the risk of damaging
your CPU is a lot higher than it is on
house well a lot higher and over and
over bridge so get a get a proper tool
if you're going to deal it get a proper
tool because the PCBs are just too thin
we're going over some questions here
movers some questions oh yeah well a lot
of questions coming in keV you got to
keep up on this bra yeah yeah how is
this someone asked what is bitter
upgrade rising or free sync I'm not
really sure doing the is kind of two
separate things if you're wondering what
10 it's very difficult in terms of which
ones can i upgrade your experience the
most I mean it depends on what you're
running right now precinct is pretty
cool I do like it but then again a lot
of people don't even notice problems
with that with screen tearing and stuff
you know like a lot of people who don't
actually care that much or they'll just
turn vsync on and they won't worry about
ghosting type issues and that's it
depends on the person but yeah I think
rising for a lot of people will be a
very good upgrade hopefully oh yeah it
as long as these numbers of ring and
truth those cinebench numbers are
ringing true reisen is going to kick ass
what do we think about the new g 45-60 i
absolutely love it i've done a couple of
videos on it already phenomenal cpu for
the money it's going to be hard to beat
it's really going to be hard to beat on
the extreme budget and especially since
it could be coupled with those cheap
motherboards the G 45-60 is easily a win
of course I want to see what AMD have
verizon but it's not going to get much
better even if it did get better that's
all I can say so yeah bio stars yeah
apparently a lot of people like okay
they've been using their boards for 15
years dang ok I just I've never seen
them on retail shelves in odds so I
don't know how long they've been helpful
but I check their financials and
apparently they're pretty bad I
shouldn't maybe I should keep that off a
strangler yeah don't don't don't like if
you're using biostar and you're happy
keep using them guys again don't let my
then let my stupid opinions affect you
how much how much is a used I 2,600 in
your country here I I sevens are
expensive men
you know if I was going for an i7 2600
because the you just get it on board and
just get the 1231 IV just the foot the
first I think it's the first what a v2
maybe you get the Sandy Bridge ZL
variant and it's going to be a little
bit cooler so yeah but they go pretty
expensive i'd say that easily still be
around 150 us for 2600 k at least that
was the biggest the biggest crime i
think oversaw from Intel was the 2600
cane the 2700 k the fact that they
charged so much more for the 2700 k and
the only difference between it was that
it had a hundred megahertz higher clock
speed that was the only difference yeah
well you can be anything it is 2700 and
the 2600 k they were both overclockable
and so many people fell into that trap
um which is quite sad you know um that
they did that to people so I didn't like
that and tilted that looking back now I
think that was very cheeky it was
chicken move so gotta see I have you
guys tried the micro board ultra white
Korean monitor no but I parents got
million panels the samsung when I saw
the samsung how the QT LEDs I just you
know I saw that I've been watching the
micro board for a few months I almost
bought it I mean there was a few videos
up i think texts in right now sorry what
is it crit critical strike so critical
strike did a video on the micro board
and it was pretty good i was like damn
that i want to buy one of these things
but i was like nah white leds before i
buy a high-end monitor i'm going to wait
for proper backlighting i started
remember we were doing like we're
talking about OLEDs with the last couple
of weeks you know we're talking about
OLEDs so I just started doing research I
was like okay what the Hisense released
this cutie LED TV I was like I started
researching and then this monitor popped
up I was like are you serious it's out
already it's not out on the Strand I
didn't know if it's out on a strand
retail shelf but it was on freakin
ebay from dream cellar now dreams
he's pretty cool i like i love buying
from this guy i bought a few korean
monitors from him already every time
they've been on point i was just like
dude can you mark this thing down
customs a little bit yeah just a little
bit just a little bit getting under the
limit ease i if sure bro do you do um it
did me do it best monitor i've ever used
in my life yeah my its cutie leds
they're legit so the micro board i'd say
you know spend the extra money that's
just my opinion because i know i've got
a white LED korean monitor right here
like this is it here here it is here
guys you know he i get to market on the
stream but here it is here it's you know
white leds you can just see the
difference like side by side that both
got VA panels i believe this this is a
korean monitor with the VA panel and
I've got them side by side and you can
see the difference you know there's just
yeah it does make a difference I'd
recommend just paying the extra money
your eyes will thank you even if you
don't consciously notice it
subconsciously your eyes will be saying
thank you for this glorious cutie LED
technology yeah my know how much in
Australia for a Snickers are they
sometimes they go on special it calls
for a dollar glad you asked yeah it's
nice because it's amazing this question
was quite good if you do a lot of
multitasking how noticeable was a
difference between a fork or 2 06 / a
core with hyper-threading in your
experience so I actually went from a
4770k which is a quad core with
hyper-threading to a 6900 k which is an
a core with hyper-threading it's not so
much the notice ability in multitasking
i would say unless you're just doing
extreme multitasking with you know heaps
and heaps and heaps heaps of stuff it's
more the productivity you really notice
it like render times when I'm doing my
videos oh it's just haft if not more
yeah that's that side of things has just
been fantastic so that's really where
I've noticed the major difference in
gaming performance between the two
there's not that much difference to be
honest i don't think i would notice any
difference between the two to be
completely fair the single thread of
performance isn't anything to write home
about it's just that pure grunts of the
multi-threaded performance when you're
doing productivity stuff is absolutely
fantastic and that's where I really
notice it and if you're doing photo
editing and other things like that
you'll really notice it as well I going
up to a six core a core yeah i'll play
my i play my two cents here i think the
six core is the balance king personally
i think if you overclock that thing
you've got because the most multitasking
I'll ever do is have a game open I'll be
rendering be listening to music and i'll
be on skype whatever you know you're
doing four different things at the same
time that's it will notice a difference
going from a four-course escort doing
that even more so an eight-core would be
a little bit a bit suks scores really
the balance there if you're a power user
and you're doing a lot of stuff at the
same time any more than that yeah the
more you do the more cause you'd want
obviously but as well the memory speeds
I find make it this is where the memory
speeds make the difference in my opinion
if you overclock your memory too
ridiculously high levels they do help
with multitasking that's just what I've
found like just when you're snapping
between programs yeah I noticed a little
bit yeah I'm pretty anal retentive
though so some people going to be like
air but I'm pretty anal retentive about
these little things like this but that's
where memory speeds do make a bit of a
difference also good asked v-moda m100 s
i'm wearing v motors but they're the
crossfade LP s now these things are
ridiculously good for a neutral sound
like I don't know which model they are i
just bought them for use for 50 bucks
but when i started editing with them
they were extremely good for editing
never had someone complain about my
audio ever since i got these so I love
them armed consumer listening like end
collared headphones I've got the l ones
but they're there again they're colored
so they're pretty warm headphones
crossfade LP i absolutely love them as
an all-rounder and they're good for
music they're good for editing really
good headphones v-moda make some
incredible products too so how to check
them out x 99 is already dead yes
it is X nu X 2 99's already had been
announced that that is yeah yeah okay so
next upgrade new 144 hurts or I lost the
question the guy was asking about so
many questions coming in guys awesome i
love it because sometimes you get no
questions i'd rather there be a lot of
questions I lost the question and a what
mom memory were you running by the what
at what memories are you running what
speech since we're just talking about
three gigahertz at the moment just
reading the Panther I actually know I'm
running him at 2,600 I think I've got
the timings down I've actually got a
check which one up yeah ok here we go we
got here next upgrade he wants a new
hundred and forty-four hurts 1080p
monitor away no he didn't ask a question
on my god he just city's getting that
what is a better off crowd rising or
free sync are weird to talked about that
yet okay yeah um right there I'd say
anyway I'd say yeah I said it rise it's
difficult to answer yet in some ways I
already sarbat Rosen's a big upgrade
it's going to be great why isn't the G
45-60 in the US yet that's interesting
hey I've got no idea why am I guess
they're tested you know this is the
thing though this is the thing you know
you've seen it with ebay you've seen it
with a few companies before you see like
Australia for instance is like a testing
ground I think they want to see how well
the G 45-60 does in Australia and the UK
and then maybe they can sort of like
figure out the pricing a little bit i'll
share the cpu cell into well it's going
to be cutting on the i3 completely maybe
we should up the price 20 bucks I think
that's why because the u.s. is a huge
market right that's you know the G 45-60
hits the US I can imagine so many people
buying this thing so I think that's why
it hasn't hit the US yet if there was a
legit reason for it that would probably
be it I think they're testing the waters
with it in other countries to see how
well it sells and then you're going to
see ya hit the US but i think it's just
such good value for money Australia's 78
australian dollars friggin bargain 58
USD or whatever converted that's insane
for a cpu new cpu like that
ok young business objectives would it be
worth buying a 144 hurts IPS 1440p
monitor now or later and just buy a 60
Hertz 1440p monitor now i have a uh 9
fury nitro nice choice waiting and it
will be peering with a risin cpu so i
actually really really really love 1440p
high refresh rate it's probably my
favorite types of monitors are those
ones it's just so good for gaming oh
it's just specially if it's g-sync or
free sync as well because you have you
tried the Sentinel transforms it yeah I
haven't tried the samsung any given I
will there you go hopefully in the
future that is really really damn nice I
think I mean as Brian said earlier um
you know you do spend all your time
looking at the monitor so getting a
really good monitor does a transforming
experience so yeah if you can get that
really good one then I would say it's
worth it yeah just remember though you
need to power the system power to run it
there's no point getting a higher fresh
rate monitor if your system is not
powerful enough to pump the frames out
yeah if it's just going to be sitting it
around 60 anyway I mean what's the point
so well the thing is absolutely well the
thing I was going to say is I'd go with
the 60 Hertz 1440p now and wait for
something with better backlighting and
whatnot on that sort of end I mean
personally i'd recommend these 34 inches
to anyone incredible to see if 79 ones
absolutely love a lot of fanboying it
but it's worth a fanboy you know your
eyes deserve better than white leds but
if you know with the Nitro I just say go
60 Hertz 1440p now save your box wait
till because you know look you're going
to see the CF 791 it's going to get it's
going to sell man it's going to sell
really well and what that means is
people are going to be saying look I
want more for my money I want better
backlighting they're going to be
supporting Samsung other companies going
to see this LG will start releasing a no
LED
ultra wide you know you're going to see
LG do that now they're going to make the
pushing it is like Samsung's again
all the sales we're going to do
something about it so this is what
drives innovation and I'm going to
support the company there's driving
innovation at the moment Samsung's doing
that you know Dell scrap their LED 4k
monitor barely it had contrast shift
issues or whatever so I researched
apparently just had issues that were non
they couldn't be fixed so yeah none the
wiser just go with the cheap monitor
there's the 200 bucks 200 us I on ebay
at the moment for a 1440p 60 Hertz
monitors go get one of them hold out the
apocalypse the white LED apocalypse just
wait it out I think it's a 50s it must
be it'll still be pretty good though in
terms of the quality i mean i can get
where you're meaning about saving your
eyes but in terms of the color quality
and stuff like that i mean those IPS
1440p high refresh rate monitors so
usually pretty good animals I've never
run into a bad one I know I mean that
they're good is like the predator on
that big very good they're good but it's
just after using this it's like it's a
blast to the past for me I can remember
the ccfl glory days like that's for me
it just reminds me of using a ccfl
monitor text is so sharp a colors of way
better but you know of course you're
going to have the guy with thee there's
going to be the guy linking me to all
these links you know TFT central now
it's a central do a fantastic job but
again machines and human eyes it's got
to be a part where you say okay
subjectively i love this monitor now my
eyes are going to be different to your
eyes but there's going to be a part
where you're going to say look the
machines can do all the talking they
want they can give you all the factual
results you want but at the end of the
day yeah you the user have to make the
decision if you have these two monitors
side by side which would you like better
and I just after using this thing I
freaking love it you know it's a blast
of the past I'd even like to see them
bring back ccfl backlight on budget
monitors I think that sell really well
so yeah one might be so many we see in
the future soon also i sent a similar
thing 144 1440p yet 144 hurts gtx 1070
is it in
oh yeah that should be fine you might
depending on the type of game you're
playing easier to play games such as
yeah overwatch or something like that
you'll be just yeah that'll be fine I
higher-end Triple A titles and stuff you
may need if you want to be taking
advantage of that high refresh rate you
may need to drop off the filters and a
few things like that that will help it
get up a bit higher hold you at that
probably you'd want it to be at least
averaging around 100 I got after you
know a bit motherboards yes I've got an
abit motherboard here i bought it in the
junk bin um funny that hey I've got a
shell got what I don't know what they're
doing nowadays but yeah actually do know
they did oh yeah I've got one in the in
the bin Lakers I think it's old school
like socket something 49 or something
man i forgot my old school so yeah 939
that's the one yeah anyone tried days of
war if you tried des wall no there you
go now I haven't alright see ya we're
topics arm I have an off-topic not hot
question what do you think about as
Roxxxy 97 extreme for motherboard not
bad d string for is always going to be
that sort of mediocre vrm decent for the
money see 97 should be no different I
actually forgot what exactly like what
exactly what exactly MOSFETs they're
putting exact exact MOSFETs are putting
on that chokes and yep caps etc but yes
usually where there's a the extreme for
Fitz it's a pretty good balance I like
it for the money yeah ok so we're
winding up the questions guys if you've
got any sort of last question for Brian
are you on the overclocking Australia's
forums ah I mean I've joined I've joined
the overclock au forums I just I don't
check it much I've just been so busy
place is a goldmine for such cheap
secondhand parts yeah true awesome um I
mean I've got to check that out maybe
four cpus I'd go check out the
overclocking forums because you know
post is just really cheap but like when
it comes to getting bigger parts like
especially like motherboards or graphics
cards and stuff like that you really
want to
pick them up locally so gumtree yet
easily be the best for that I mean you
saw that if you didn't see that vlog
video I did yet man I picked over 770 a
7950 and a 280x for like 280 Australian
total for the three greatest cards so
what's that like not even 200 us or
something ridiculous man 3 really damn
good graphics cards even till this date
for like Ethel you know I mean
incredible yes and they're all good
condition I've got the 770 it's running
right now and it's funny this 770 right
here it's the reference model from EVGA
but it's actually surprisingly really
quiet like I thought it was only
remember they had their founders their
metal shroud even on the 780 and the 780
ti they had their whatever fancy model
and then they had the dumb down models
this yeah this is supposedly the Dom
down model but it's actually really good
like it's actually really damn quiet I
was shocked how quiet that thing was on
the 770 I was like why was expecting it
to be a freaking aircraft but it's
actually had it like it's actually
really good so yeah yeah awesome so I'm
a one question that was interesting this
would be good for you Brian as well any
bad selling experience with selling
older parts any advice when selling well
from my point of view I haven't done a
lot of it so Brian will probably have
better advice at me but yeah I was just
always very truthful when I was selling
old pc parts you know take very clear
pictures tell the people yeah there was
an old cpu i would tell them that it had
been overclocked or anything i just try
to be very truthful about it and i never
had any problems with any of it at any
point okay yeah um don't dare don't sell
rubbish like you know if you sell
rubbish should just bring it down the
whole community really like yeah you
know I've every time I do a build it's
funny because like for me I don't know
like I don't take pride in the cosmetics
of a build but I do take pride in how
the final product runs you know and I
get a lot of questions on those years
build like a lot of people will be
messaging me gone dude you know you like
your computer's your pcs running better
than my I 749 447 90k and a GTX 980 and
it's like yeah that's that's what I do
like I tweaked
the windows everything I make sure the
overclocks are stable everything's
running just you know perfecto and then
I sell it that's that's how I do it so I
make sure the things running really well
and then I sell it make sure
everything's smooth because the guy
getting this I tell them to you know
when I sell this I say look it's
overclocked you might be fair using it
in an even when i sell the computer i
say look are you using this in an aircon
environment are you using it in an on
air con environments you know especially
now in summer if he's if he's saying no
I'm using it just no aircon I'll
actually go in down clock the stuff for
them like I'll go down clock it to safer
levels because that's yeah so yeah you
got to take pride in what yourself if
you always take Brian what yourself
people are going to recommend you to
friend yeah okay so uh I bought from him
and bass he's awesome I'm gonna buy from
him again so yeah do yourself a favor
and just take prime we sell if you can
smell be truthful be honest if you guys
so trash it's going to come back and
bite you in the ass calmer yeah Holly
Thomas come as a bitch count as a real
thing it exists yeah and it exists for a
reason it's just the act of being dodgy
so don't be dodgy yeah take pride in
what you sell my used bills they just
like seriously they when I put them off
a cell they sell in a few days like I do
you know I'm surprised at how fast some
of them sell and I'm like I'm making a
decent profit sometimes so yeah that's
just the used parts i love it i love
doing the use parts except just can't do
it all the time as i said in that vlog
it's like you know I it's because I film
the whole thing I have to edit the video
and you know it takes ages to do those
videos because I got a bench market
install window like all the all the
stuff you see on camera that takes so it
takes a long time to do a video if I was
just going on so much stuff goes on
behind sings a like people don't
understand how long it takes us to make
videos is like about ten probably five
percent of your time spent making a
video is like filming then probably
about twenty percent or thirty percent
is editing and all the rest is just prep
and testing really getting the right
angle on the camera for me it's like
probably about thirty percent of like I
could if I if I was just not
camera no camera no editing no filming I
probably do everything three times
faster basically I could have a building
I could ever build ready to go in half a
day likes ready to go get ready to build
and sell but since i'm filming it making
a video for you guys it's two days for
up for a whole 68 just yeah talking on
the camera filming it editing it posting
it yes i move the camera stop filming
and do something else move the camera
yeah it takes it takes a lot of work
guys so hope you appreciated though i
hope you guys appreciate and you do I
mean there's a so many people who
appreciate it I think you guys so much
for that but of course you get the one
guys like I want more it's like man I'm
only human brother I want I want more I
want it now goddammit yeah no just you
Sony's here didn't well I guess we're
gonna get we're going to get out of here
guys thanks for tuning in episode 12 of
the tech lounge action we got a lot of
live viewers thanks we got like a lot
almost 300 really cool thanks for tuning
in life guys think kevs audios fixed too
and it's going to be fixed from now on
because I know kids yeah we yeah
it'sit's we knew was set up beforehand
um because we had it checked so we knew
everything was sweet so if it's going a
bit funny on the stream then it must be
something else going on because
definitely I mind it was were standing
is sounding a lot yeah was 100% set so
if they're still having problems and it
might just be something with the stream
or the internet connection or yeah or
something cause ending in the title in
the title i'm going to put in caps Kev's
audio fixed T so save save some
characters as well so yeah okay right
sure it's it's dad Pascal refresh not
Maxwell refreshed I got a sidepiece hits
don't explode are gonna be careful guys
I'm sorry make these mistakes just like
the H vs H where I well you know it's
funny because they say in eastern South
East Queensland especially it's all
everyone says h HD
alright guys we're gonna catch you next
week live thanks for tuning in you guys
are awesome check out the tech city
forums check out tech city TV go check
out kevs channel as well i'll put a link
in the description and yeah guys thanks
