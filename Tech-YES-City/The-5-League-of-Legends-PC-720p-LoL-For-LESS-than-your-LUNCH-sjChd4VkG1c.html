set and just getting the burger what
would you do with that money saved well
you can get yourself a $5 League of
Legends combo
welcome back to take our city this is
brian coming to you guys today with a $5
gaming pc now when i tested this thing
out it could actually play league of
legends at 720p and now for $5 i gotta
say it doesn't get any cheaper than this
ladies and gentlemen so with all that
said we're going to take a look at the
cost of this pc then we're going to move
on to the cleanse and then the
benchmarks
so here's the $5 PC we are going to boot
this thing up and see if we can get a
signal I do though for $5 they do expect
problems no matter what I do I just
can't believe the five dollar PC would
come with ddr3 four gigabytes of ddr4 a
three memory and be working perfectly
fine so we've got a signal here this is
good pals player means the power supply
works and looks like the DVD ROM was
working but we can see here we're just
getting a little flashing signal now so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take the CMOS battery out and then
unplug this and then try and boot it up
again so we'll give that another shot
okay so now it's time for round two
we're gonna start this Dell up and see
if we can get a signal out of it now I'm
actually kind of hopeful that the hard
drive works because you know on a
five-dollar PC if only the DVD drive is
broken and that's actually a really good
thing so here we go so we got yeah
that's the normal normal boot so that's
actually a very normal boot and that's
actually a really good sign so we can
see here yeah everything's being
recognized we actually don't even have
to go into the BIOS because we can see
here it's recognizing the 160 gigabyte
side a hard disk and the memory is all
recognized as well so for gigabytes of
memory this is going to be awesome let's
get on with this hewlett-packard
I thought this thing was a delta that
doesn't notice ain't it so now we're
just going through this BIOS and I'm
trying to turn things and even just look
for information like what's CPU I've
actually got in here because I couldn't
be bothered taking off the heatsink at
the moment but this BIOS is like ancient
now one thing you will want to do on a
system like this is just check the date
and time we can see here that this is
way off and this will actually cause
errors if you go into Windows because it
will then think it back in you know 2000
live biscuit error
you're right I want to change what this
is I kind of how do I move over I
figured it out it's the tab key the tab
key saved the day
there we go 2016 baby
so now we're going to redo some
benchmarks with a GT 430 that I have
lying around I actually picked this
thing up for around about $10
you come too far
Oh
so there we have it the $5 PC could play
League of Legends perfectly fine at 720p
though when we try to play other games
like csgo and also dota2 even at 720p on
the lower settings we could barely even
get up to 20 frames per second just
coming a little bit under however when
we did add in a little graphics card
like the GT 430 I was surprised that the
performance gains that we had we were
able to now play pretty much all these
games at 1080p at 60 frames per second
with League of Legends now being able to
play at the highest settings at 1080p
which is very impressive for a now $15
PC the one of the drawbacks of the $15
PC well not a lot I mean if you want to
play the latest titles like fallout 4
and GTA 5 you're going to be out of luck
though if you're looking for something
to play some of those really popular
multiplayer titles like csgo dota 2 and
League of Legends and something like
this in the background will serve you
really well so you're probably wondering
how I get these pcs for so cheap well
actually look around my local junk and
use parts stores and I find bargains
because I know what I'm looking for I'm
able to then get the right parts and get
the best value however I also get lucky
on another front and at this time all
the parts were working perfectly fine
anyway that's about it for me today guys
if you like this video then be sure to
give it a big thumbs up if you have any
questions or comments about the $5 slash
upgradeable to $15 PC then be sure to
drop a comment the comment section below
and I'll get back to you as soon as I
can
peace out for now bye your $5 PC bro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
