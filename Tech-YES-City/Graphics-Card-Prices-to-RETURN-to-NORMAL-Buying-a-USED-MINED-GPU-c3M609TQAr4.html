brand-spanking-new gravis card well if
you do there is some really good news
and that's providing the prices don't
skyrocket for cryptocurrencies again but
in the next two weeks you could see
gravis card prices returned completely
to normal because the demand for
brand-new gravis cards is going to
pretty much drop and that is because
there is a breaking point and I believe
we are at that breaking point right now
where cryptocurrency is practically no
longer profitable at least in Australia
and UK where the price of power is
currently high but also if it drops down
a little bit more safer places like the
US or even in places like to buy you
could see a massive flooding of used
graphics cards on the market so let's
talk about this little phenomena of
difficulty versus price on the
cryptocurrency market
welcome back to tech yesterday you have
probably seen that thumbnail already
breaking point that's where we're at at
the moment because prices of crypto
currencies have gone down they have gone
down a lot since January now January was
a very special month for crypto
currencies and you may be asking why
because prices were stupid
Zen cash though my favorite crypto
currency that was going up to $60 I knew
then I had to sell some of this thing I
did things guys money doesn't grow on
trees and if it does just take as much
as you can and run off that's what I did
but anyway what we got here difficulty
since January however difficulty is a
very important thing we're gonna talk
about that today
with Zen cash because difficulty is
basically when you get a graphics card
and you put it to mine on a crypto
currency what happens with that is that
you're using that compute power to go
towards computing the algorithm and now
that algorithm will spit out coins as a
reward however that algorithms are set
tone it sets a certain amount of coins
in a fashion that goes in a linear of
fashion well it's actually like a curve
but basically it'll spit out a set
number of coins at a set interval of
time and so the more graphs cards you
have trying to mine that algorithm the
less coins per gram Scott's gonna spit
out especially as the difficulty goes up
profitability at the same price point of
a cryptocurrency goes down if that makes
any sense but what we've seen since
January is the price of crypto
currencies go down in in case of Zen
caching now this is important because I
do have experience with Zen cache in the
past and I know the difficulty versus
the power consumption and those ratios
to where the profitability will lie and
currently in countries like Australia
Japan in the UK where power is expensive
I believe we are currently at breaking
point basically breaking even so if
you're using your grabs cards to mine
cryptocurrencies in these countries
especially Zen cash then you will be
actually possibly even losing money
after you put into account exchange fees
and conversions and also wasting your
time too in the US and this is the big
one because this is where a lot of that
out of stock and ridiculous pricing is
coming from you could see breaking point
at around 13 USD this is
- so you might even want to favorite
this in your browser if you're into
buying a new graphics card or a used
grabs card because this is a breaking
point and if this happens you could see
a flood of use grabs cards on the market
we're talking used gtx 1060 s so modern
cards though to answer the question of
can i buy a new graphics card at a
normal price the answer is yes actually
very soon I saw a 1070 TI up on Amazon
that's going for around 580 so it's not
too overpriced and that's pretty much
similar to a 1080 in performance but in
the next two weeks as long as these
prices remain the same or even if they
go down a little bit then your grabs
cards are gonna return to normal very
soon
so do not feel you gravis cards I
believe will be coming back into stock
at normal prices now in regards to the F
market and the theorem I don't really
have much experience with the theorem I
don't really know what the prices to
profitability to power consumption
ratios are but since I've been mining
xancash in the past I do know those
ratios so we've talked about difficulty
we've talked about prices but we're
going to talk about the question of
would you buy a used mind graphics card
that is a big question that I know is
going to come up in the comments section
and the answer is it depends and I'd say
the majority vote would go to yes I
would buy a used Gramps card on my knee
bench now let me explain why because a
lot of people who buy mining graphics
cards will be setting the fan speeds to
a hundred percent but they'll also be
dropping the TDP power limits to around
eighty percent sometimes even less and
now with that your grass card essential
of these graphs cards that are mining
could be your graphics card because you
could be buying it for a really good
price these graphics cards essentially
have been run underpowered so they're
not get generating as much heat so heat
kills components we know this but also
overclocking as well over vaulting if
these things are being under vaulted
underpowered and they're running at
fifty five to six degrees all day every
day
they're running under that safety spec
they're running really well so they'll
be absolutely fine not only that the
graphs car manufacturers generally give
you a
generous warranty warranty on parts is a
great indicator of how long that
components going to run as I spoke to
Johnny guru in the past those components
are raided at that full runtime 24/7 for
that year span that's when they do that
out of the factory
so the capacitors and things like that
so most grams cards especially 10 70s 10
80s they have good components on board
they're gonna last and they're gonna
last a lot longer especially if they've
been treated right and most miners
despite what people say they have been
treating their cards right but I do know
where that comes from though in the past
for Bitcoin especially in 2013 a lot of
people were using AMD graphics cards to
mine these cryptocurrencies and they
didn't really know what they were doing
they just put them on the mining bench
and went yee-ha and so those cards were
getting very hot and when they sold them
on the market they were dying within
months I guess that's where that culture
comes from don't buy a used graphics
card that's been used for mining I'd say
in 2017 2018 it's a much different story
but anyway guys last thing I'm going to
talk about with the whole mining thing
and the prices is the market itself I've
read and researched articles that are
stating that cryptocurrency is literally
like stock market on steroids it's 15
times sped up that is insane so
basically one month on a cryptocurrency
exchange or the cryptocurrency market is
like 15 months on the stock market that
is so crazy so basically that means
there's a lot of volatility there's a
lot of ups and downs and another thing
I've researched as well this is a very
important one hedge funds have gone from
trading FX currencies for instance and I
believe they're moving into crypto
currencies big-time and now hedge funds
have a lot of money and with a lot of
money you can control markets especially
unregulated once so do keep that into
account and I have warned people when
they do get into crypto currencies just
know what you're getting into because at
any given time that crypto currency
especially when it's sped up 15 times
fast
than a stock market that cryptocurrency
could become irrelevant tomorrow but
unfortunately the money that you
exchanged to buy that crypto that's
relevant so just be careful with crypto
currencies I've said this in the past
know what you're getting into and it's a
big danger but anyway in terms of the
new grabs cards they will be coming back
in stock that's just my opinion and
don't have to worry if you're on the
fence just wait a little bit longer next
two weeks I believe graphs card prices
will be returning to normal
unless of course the prices just
skyrocket which is the possibility but
if you want to buy a used card on a
mining bench
I just sauce the seller up if you can
talk to the seller if he's a genuine
person and he doesn't seem like he's too
much of a bull fed then you should be
fine
and every guy's hope you enjoyed today's
video if you did I'll catch you in the
next Tech video don't forget to hit the
like the like button
and you guys hope you enjoyed today's
video if you did then be sure to hit
that like button and let me know in a
comment section below do you think new
cards are gonna come down in the next
couple of weeks
also what's your opinions on buying a
used car that's been on a mining bench
Lovering your thoughts and opinions as
always and let me know what you think of
the new stream news deck and also I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now wait
you want to buy a new graphics card well
if you do there is some really good news
because in the next couple of weeks
there is a literally gonna be okay no
echo now we are at breaking point and
what this means is if you are into
cryptocurrency mining no we I'm not we
I'm not part of the cryptocurrency gang
I don't a cop all those thumbs down
dislikes I'm gonna be somewhere in the
middle the messenger</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
