thread Ripper CPU which was 16 cores and
32 threads however this year they've
decided to double up and introduce a
consumer CPU with 32 cores and 64
threads and that is the 2990 WX and
we've got this right here today in the
tech yet studio and we're gonna run it
through all its paces versus intel's
flagship cpu and that is the i9 79-80
XP now I've clocked these both at 4
gigahertz so it's going to be apples to
apples in clock speeds and also we're
gonna test the out-of-the-box default
speeds for those people who don't like
delving into overclocks so strap on in
get ready and let's see this showdown of
these two behemoths in productivity
benchmarks
welcome back to takia city and first of
all we've got 32 cores 64 threads of 12
nanometer plus architecture from AMD the
improvements they have made this time
around is not just delivering more cause
and more threads but also focusing on
dropping the latency which is very
important for not just end user results
but also improving productivity scores
not to mention the CPUs in general can
overclock higher than the previous
generation 1000 series thanks to the 12
nanometer refined process note that AMD
is using but another thing to mention
with these CPUs these high-end skews
that AMD are introducing is that they
use the top 5% of dies they actually
bend them to be the most efficient in in
turn giving you the most power
efficiency and the best overclocks for
your 32 cores and 64 threads if you wish
to purchase it now price-wise we're
looking at 799 USD so it is quite an ask
and first of all I will say before we
get into benchmarks is this is a CPU
that's not geared towards gamers if
gaming is your number one priority there
are much cheaper and much better options
and especially for bang for buck but
also getting absolute performance for
your dollar today's focus is going to be
on productivity benchmarks these real
high-end desktop CPUs have a specific
purpose in my opinion and that is for
people who want to reduce their work
time and actually make things more
efficient in their office environment so
with that in mind we'll quickly roll out
the meat and potatoes of this review and
the first benchmark I'll pull up here is
7-zip if you're into decompressing and
compressing this is where the AMD CPU
scored a monster victory in terms of its
decompressing numbers the compressing
numbers did fall a little bit behind so
I'm not entirely sure why this is but
it's important to note that AMD is still
using quad channel memory with the 32
cores that could be a limiting factor in
perhaps the compression side of things
but in terms of the decompressing side
scored a monster victory over Intel here
moving over to handbrake and more of a
real-world benchmark to change things up
when transcoding a 4k video file to
1080p 30fps and what we saw here was the
79 80 X e did score a slight victory
both at default and overclocked settings
when it came to
comparing it to the 32 call option and
this of course is just to do with thread
utilization which inba this particular
benchmark was at about forty to sixty
percent for the AMD cpu so it wasn't
fully utilizing those calls and threads
for transcoding video and the
utilization is going to be a big factor
in the outcome of today's conclusion so
stay tuned and notice that because we're
moving on now to v-ray which is a
simulator benchmark and here we have a
hundred percent utilization and we can
see that the 32 core sixty four threaded
twenty nine ninety WX scores a victory
both on default and even on overclocked
settings it goes faster and it just
comes out ahead of the 79 80 X e moving
over to pov-ray 3.7 this is a benchmark
that again scored a victory for the AMD
counterpart and it did score quite a
sizable victory again with a hundred
percent CPU utilization
now moving over to another benchmark
that I started throw in the mix is the
DPC latency benchmark because AMD do
make a big note of showing that their
latency has improved with the 32 or 64
thread adoption and this is showing with
the DPC latency checker maxing out at
around 12 56 nanoseconds and a thousand
when you overclock it and the Intel side
of things did score slightly better so
if you're on a music production both
these CPUs will do a good job but if you
are looking to do a specific program
then you may wish to ask the maker of
that program which CPU and how many
cores and threads is the sweet spot
again the utilization thing I'm probably
gonna keep reminding you guys throughout
this video why it's important because
that money out of your wallet is going
to be related and correlated to the
value for money of the utilization in
that benchmark or in that application
that you're going to use the majority of
the time and now speaking of the
majority of the time I personally use
Adobe a lot Adobe Premiere Pro and
Photoshop and pretty much my go-to
applications for getting you guys
content and here we have the premier Pro
benchmark with its recent updates and
optimizations for Intel CPUs showing the
79 80 XE is scoring quite a sizable
victory here near some of the victory
sizes that we saw when the AMD
CPUs at a hundred percent utilization
but unfortunately for the 32 core
monster it was only getting utilized at
around 30 to 50 percent as opposed to
the Intel CPU which is going near a
hundred percent on this particular
benchmark which enabled it to smash
through this render and score a big
victory here however continuing on with
Adobe one benchmark that I saw at the
launch event was dimension and this is a
new program that I don't have a whole
lot of experience with personally though
AMD did make a note at the event that
their CPUs and threads were getting a
hundred percent utilization even on the
twenty nine ninety WX doing my own
little tests here with the AMD benchmark
provided I couldn't initially get it to
work properly but I did find one setting
at a thousand and twenty four by seven
six eight resolution that did give us
some numbers and it showed that it was
beating the 79 80 XE not by a whole lot
but it's still a victory regardless and
moving on now to DaVinci Resolve so
testing an individual 30-minute render
file out it showed that the CPU on the
intel side the 79 80 XE did score a
victory when we're doing 4k ultra mp4
output so moving on with some more
simulated benchmarks here we have
Cinebench of course being one of the
most popular and poster child's for
utilizing cpu cores and threads and the
2990 WS did not disappoint scoring over
6,000 points at 4 gigahertz with the
Animax cooler I also tested the Wraiths
Ripper cooler both did a fine job of
handling the CPU at those said speeds
now the default speeds scored just over
5,000 contrast that to the Intel side of
things 3900 and round over 3,300 points
on default the single threaded scores
were still slightly advantageous for the
Intel but that was at the same clock
speed so the IPC benefit is slightly
better on Intel side of things though
moving on to power consumption when I
tested in I 264 the 18 core of course
having a lot less calls and threads did
score better and power consumption from
the wall both overclocked and on default
settings the 32 core 64 threaded monster
did start to use up a lot more power as
you go past 3.4 gig oh it's going over
to 4 gigahertz didn't see near an extra
what's being juice from the wall so your
mileage may vary with overclocks but I
think around 4 gigahertz is a nice sweet
spot for this CPU especially on 32 cores
though another thing we can see from
those Cinebench scores is that the
out-of-the-box turbo speeds what I'm
noticing is we're getting anywhere from
three point two to three point four
gigahertz on all cores on the AMD side
of things the precision overdrive didn't
really change this with the Cinebench
score still core scoring five thousand
points as opposed to default speeds I
think the motherboard manufacturers are
probably already pre overclocking the
CPU just a little bit on the intel side
of things you're getting around 3.4
gigahertz on all cores out of the box
and a turbo up to 4.2 you got so when
manually setting both these CPUs to 4
gigahertz the single core performance
actually does slightly better on default
settings because those single turbo
boosts on both AMD which goes from
around four point zero five to four
point one five gigahertz and on Intel
site which goes to four point two
gigahertz is higher than that four
gigahertz though the next thing that
we're pulling up now is w prime where
I'm pretty sure the W stands for what
mate and we've got here the thread
Ripper CPU of four gigahertz getting
twenty eight seconds and 33 seconds on
the larger test but on the smaller test
it's actually falling behind by just a
slight ever-so amount so it was
interesting to see Intel pull ahead on
the smaller test but then winning for
the AMD on the bigger test I guess it
just takes time to ramp up all those
calls and threads and when it does
that's when thread rip off takes
advantage and takes the victory and now
with winding out the benchmarks we'll do
some quick gaming benchmarks for you
guys 3d mark 5 strike really showed that
the 32 cores is not your best option for
gaming we saw some weird results here
where essentially with the for dianne
abled on the AMD side of things we were
getting really low scores on both the
GPU and the CPU side of things a 79 80
XE did score a big victory here but
there is an option in the rise and
master software which you can use for
overclocking that allows you to turn it
into game mode which essentially just
enables one die and then you'll get much
better results and of course this will
translate into
better results for gaming but when we
look at gaming benchmarks like csgo
leaving it in creative mode and
especially for streaming we consider the
79 80 XE still does pull ahead on both
default and overclocked settings and
then go into streaming it doesn't really
drop it all on the aim DS side of things
because it does have a lot of headroom
for the intel is still beating it out
so winding down the gaming benchmarks
and one interesting thing to note is
that Windows is currently recognizing
this CPU as essentially four died and
that's different to the 79 80 XE which
is recognized as a single CPU in Windows
so AMD do tell me that they are working
with Microsoft to patch the scheduler
and help fix things down hopefully this
will translate into better 3dmark
firestrike scores in creative mode as
well but as it stands you've got quad
channel memory and 32 cores but if you
are into gaming and streaming then I
will be taking a look at the 29 50 X
which comes in practically half the
price of the 2990 WX and you still got
quad channel memory and a lot of
headroom in terms of cores and threads
so stay tuned for that but what we've
got here is a CPU that's geared towards
productivity if the application can
utilize 32 cores and 64 threads that's
where you're gonna see a massive benefit
with the thread Ripper 2990 WX now of
course the amount of applications that
can utilize this many threads in this
many cores properly is still yet to be
seen
I'm just using some benchmarks here and
of course I'm using some of the programs
that I use in my workflow and it still
isn't showing a hundred percent
utilization for the 2990 WX that's up to
software developers to catch up if they
want to fully utilize the potential of
this CPU here and I think in ways it's
sort of geared up towards the future the
CPU and in some cases if you're looking
at Maya
Arnel Brenda which unfortunately I
couldn't get it to work on my computer
at least the test bench and I did try a
couple of different motherboards because
I have three different motherboards here
try different coolers and updating
biases in different memory and I still
couldn't get this benchmark to work it
must have just been some settings that
went wrong but anyway Meier aside this
CPU especially with some of those
Mark's like v-ray Cinebench 7-zip showed
the potential of the 32 core 64 threads
and at 1,800 us this thing is an
absolute monster not only in its total
performance but also its performance per
dollar I'm really impressed what AMD are
bringing to the table especially in 2018
they're really forcing Intel to step up
their game as well as bringing their own
game to the market and they're gaining a
lot of market share so it's really good
times in the cpu market in 2018 and if
you ask me a couple of years ago if
we're gonna see 32 cores 64 threads for
1,800 US dollars in 2018 I would have
said no way
that's not possible but AMD is doing
that and of course how relevant this CPU
is for you as a user all depends on your
workflow and the applications that
you're going to use if you can utilize
this CPU 100 percent or even near that
then you're gonna get really good value
for money and you're gonna be saving a
lot of time as well however you can't
use that then you can look at some of
the other options available and of
course save some money but in terms of
which should you buy the 79 80 X II or
the 32 core 2990 WX again that remains
up to you what is your main priority are
you using just Adobe or are you using a
lot of other applications that can
utilize all those cores and threads and
even though Doby does utilize all the
cores and threads for Intel hopefully
Adobe can span that optimization to AMD
pretty soon and then would be seeing
some different results as we saw here
today in this review anyway guys I hope
you enjoyed this one if you did then be
sure to hit that like button if you have
any questions or comments about the 2990
WX then be sure to hit me up in the
comment section below and also stay
tuned on the channel I'll have some more
content coming in relation to the 2950 X
and also some coolers on x3 nine-nine
and if you want to get that content as
soon as it comes out then be sure to hit
the sub button and that bail
notification and turn notifications on
because apparently YouTube's telling me
that if you guys want the videos and you
don't want to miss them
then just saying sub nowadays isn't
enough who knows maybe the guys that you
tube and Google could use some thread
Ripper 2990 wxc be using their service
that way their service wouldn't glitch
as much anyway I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye okay
so today we've got 32 cores 64 threads
on the line alright so here it is ladies
that'll start off a good video hey here
it is ladies and gentlemen a twenty nine
nine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
