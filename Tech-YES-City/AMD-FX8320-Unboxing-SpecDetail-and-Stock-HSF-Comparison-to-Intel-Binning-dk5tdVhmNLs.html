coming back to you guys today from the
new ya McCarthy monitor that's lighting
up my face so let me know what you guys
think there's a lot of my face pretty
well also i am using new headphones as
well so after I do the comparison
between this and the 467 TK i'm going to
be doing a headphone budget headphone
shootout for you guys so these are some
new headphones that i've got there are
thirty-eight dollars and i'm just going
to give you a sneak preview they're
amazing so I'll get onto that later but
here's today we're going with the FX
8320 it's an eight core cpu four modules
it's 125 watts TDP it's 32 nanometer and
it's basically touted as one of the
value King CPUs out there but I'm going
to be testing it myself doing my own
testing against for 670 k and then
making some realist realistic real world
recommendations once I've tested
everything thoroughly so let's have a
look today what we get onto the in the
box and yeah let's just see what we get
in the box okay so this is what you get
you get a little box it's about the same
size as Intel's box I guess maybe a
little bit bigger so this is as it says
here AMD eight-core processor Black
Edition now straight away you'll notice
with intel processors two and this one
is it comes sealed so if that seals
broken then i recommend you maybe take
it back to the store because honestly
they may have simply bend the chip the
store that you some stores like to bend
chips you know and then sell them on
we're about and i really know but
basically if it's sealed you know that
you're getting a copy well you know
you're getting your chip that could be
fast or it couldn't be depending on the
silica madhuri so that's one thing
you've got to like about fully sealed
box now looking at so soon as you open
the box the cpu comes out and it's
packed really well it's packed just like
the intel cpus are and that's the chip
there it's just looks like a nice eight
core chip now let's look at the specs of
this this is an eight-course oh look
here that this chip here i'll try and
give you guys are close up here so let's
have a look at this this is an
eight-core so an eight-core from AMD and
it basically has 16 megabytes of cash on
board
and it's eight calls on four modules so
basically this cpu is touted as being a
really good value-for-money cpu so i'm
going to be mainly the my main reason
for getting this is also i want to try
the AMD architecture but also want to
pit it against the 4670k as you guys
know and put them head-to-head this one
hopefully being at 4.4 gigs and i'll put
the fourth 4670k at 4.2 gigs so levels
that I think anyone can achieve on both
chips so now that's the chip let's have
a look what we get in the box what else
we get with this box we basically get
AMD's warranty and fan installation
manual there and you also i mean as you
guys know the stock heatsink fans are
pretty junk so this is it here now these
CPUs are touted as running pretty hot
they are 32 nanometer so one thing I
will say this is 32 nanometer Intel's
are 22 nanometers so this generally will
use more watts for the performance so
something that AMD doesn't really as you
guys know it's one of the disadvantages
that AMD currently has versus the Intel
CPUs however they have the eight cause
there and if games and stuff like that
can utilize the eight threads then it is
actually going to be to amd's benefit or
to your benefit since you're the
consumer and you're going to be saving
money now this is the fan it comes with
I actually like this fan a lot better
than the intel stock heatsink fan so
compare them side-by-side for you guys
basically I don't really care about the
heatsink paste so it's actually it comes
pre applied with some nice heatsink
paste here now it's actually not bad
like it feels better than the intel
stock heatsink fan that that came with
so the heatsink pace that that came with
so here they are here side by side I
definitely liked AMD's stock heatsink
fan a lot better I mean if you guys
would just it actually looks like it's
made by Cooler Master as well so it says
coolermaster they're printed on the
heatsink fan which is pretty cool so
cool master are making this stock
heatsink fan which is interesting I've
never seen that before so I didn't know
that so this heatsink fan feels better
than this one if you're running stock
clocks this is all
you're going to need same with the Intel
if you're going to overclock which I am
then I am going to be using this bad boy
here so I'm going to do a review of that
soon once I set the whole test bench up
anyway this is what you get in the box
you basically get a nice little heatsink
fan and actually do like it a lot better
than Intel's heatsink fan so stock
heatsink fan so yeah so this is what you
get in the package it's pretty well
packaged just like Intel's counterpart
and it's good to go so that's what you
get in the box guys if you have any
questions about the AMD fx-8350 or 8320
then please leave a comment in the
comment section below if you like this
video please give it a thumbs up and if
you haven't subscribed take our city
where I'm going to be pitting this
against the 4670k now lastly I will say
before I go people talk about the FX
8320 not being as good as a bin as the
880 350 now my thinking on it is simply
that I think some of the 8320 s will be
bad bins of the 8350 s in other words
Andy will test all the CPUs and if they
work at four gigs native then they're
8350 s if they don't then they'll bend
them to 83 20s however I believe that
some of the 8320 s will just not be bend
at all that and it wouldn't have tested
them all cuz they got to fulfill 8320
quantities so that's just my thinking I
think some of them will run really well
some of them will just be mediocre
hopefully I've got a good chip I'm going
to be testing it as you guys know the
8320 is ridiculously cheap I picked mine
up for 160 dollars here in Japan I've
seen him go out on sale for a hundred
and thirty-three dollars i think the
cheapest i've seen them for 145 as well
in the States so if you guys want to
pick this eight core after pretty cheap
then they sometimes go on for sale
really cheap so that's that hey guys I'm
going to be testing this see how good it
goes also be making some guides to to
our overclocking to tourists for this in
the near future so stay tuned for that
and also be making the comparison really
soon anybody eyes peace out for now
right easy bye help me obi-wan Kenobi
I don't want to help you i am with the
