time to review the MX I mean the bx 100
from so it's time to review the end the
live available Emmett so let's take a
look at crucial new entry-level SSD and
that is the bx 100
welcome back to tech yes it is brian
coming back to you guys today with the
bx 100 review this is the 500 gigabyte
model and the great thing about this
review is today is I've got the previous
generation MX 100 to directly compare it
to and there's also some other things
that I'll be able to tell you about
today and that is how the MX 100 has
held up after six months of usage as I
have been using it as my main drive and
the honestly the results are pretty good
for both these drives but anyway let's
take a look at the bx 100 and what it
features then we'll look at the
benchmarks and then we'll get on to a
conclusion so the bx 100 is essentially
an even further cut-down version of the
MX 100 and what crews will have decided
to do is cut away a few features from
the MX 100 that probably the home user
would not find themselves benefiting
from and then also decided to cut the
price down even further so currently the
120 gigabyte model comes in at 69 99 or
seventy dollars recommended retail price
the hunt 250 gigabyte version comes in
at a hundred and six dollars also in
other parts of the world I'll quickly
show you guys some recommended retail
pricing here so this is for Australia
and this is for the UK so what are the
key differences let's have a look here
basically the bx 100 has a different
controller than the MX 100 so crucial
have decided to go this time around
they've decided to go with a company
called silicon motion for the controller
as opposed to the previous generation in
the MX 100 they went with the Marvel
controller now in the benchmarks I'll
show you what the key difference is
though the silicon motion controller for
what it's worth is a pretty good
controller there's no denying that also
another key feature that they've gone
away with the bx 100 is hardware level
encryption so it's a more of a feature
for businesses and server type
applications though that i don't think
the home user will sort of be at a
disadvantage from losing this feature
and another final thing that they've
gone away with is thermal protection as
well so if things are getting very hot
where your pc is then obviously that
thermal protection can protect your SSD
from overheating and
case of a serious event so also taking a
close look at the bx 100 we can see that
this time around in the 500 gigabyte
model list they've decided to go with 64
gigabyte nand flash banks here so this
is I think the first time that they're
implementing these banks as opposed to
the previous MX 100 where they were
using 16 by 16 gigabyte flash ROM banks
in that drive so that's a key thing
about the bx 100 so it is using larger
banks so another thing with the bx 100
that i really liked was this time around
they've gone with a steel back plate
with the bill construction so in the MX
100 ease the plastic build plate there
which kind of put the color a little bit
off and it's just these little things
that when a company listens it makes a
good company a great company in my
opinion so kudos to crucial for doing
that so with the bx 100 you also get
seventy two terabytes total bytes
written of the lifetime as well which
accounts to about sixty six gigabytes
per day for three years so i think it's
a great thing that crucial are being
transparent and i like that companies
like crucial are publishing these
numbers however the big question on your
mind is how does the bx 100 perform
especially compared to its little
brother or its big brother in this case
the MX 100 let's find out so let's get
on to the benchmarks and i'm sorry in
advance from a microphone it's this
microphone stands broken so we're going
to get some kind of live tech their city
commentary action going here for you
guys but anyway let's get on to the
benchmarks in the first two benchmarks
I've decided to use a SS SD and HD tune
pro SSD is such a good benchmarks my
favorite benchmark for benchmarking SSDs
as it just gives you the numbers that
you really want to know and then I
decided to go with HD tune pro and
gigabyte Wow sorry do a transfer
benchmark of a 1 gigabyte file just to
find out what's going on in real time
with these SSDs so let's get on to the
benchmarks here and the as you can see
here the MX 100 is first up here the 256
gigabyte version i love this SSD it's
currently my favorite SSD out of all the
SSDs out there especially in terms of
value for money now this SSD scored
really well in the
these scores and I have to make one
point clear and that this was used as
the main OS drive at for doing all these
benchmarks as well so if anything it's a
slight hindrance compared to the other
SSDs also another thing is before I run
all my benchmarks I do make sure that my
computer is flatlining as i call it and
that is that there's no hiccups that
could interfere potentially with the
benchmarks so i do recommend if you guys
are going to benchmark your hard drives
or SSDs you do the same anyway let's
look at this numbers here anyway
sequential reads 500 megabytes per
second that's pretty much as good as it
gets on the schedule reads sequential
writes could be a little bit better
though there are solid 330 megabytes per
second very good score there the 4k read
and write 26 megabytes per second great
speeds on those almost touching a
hundred megabytes per second on the 4k
writes very important so that's a pretty
important school that's probably my most
single-handedly most important school
and the MX 100 scores fantastic in this
regards access times are really good as
well as the queue depth scoring a
respectable 95,000 662 input outputs per
second there so I ops there are
fantastic on the MX 100 as well and this
whole drive came together to give it a
total score of a thousand and 46 nasss d
so very good they're moving on to HD pro
here we can see that I ran three
different tests different three
different data patterns actually just to
get an idea of what's going on here and
you see here the lines are just pretty
smooth all across the board so this is a
again a big shout-out i guess to the
marvel controller because this is why
people love the Marvel controller on the
SS this is such a good controller this
will take care of giving you a smoothest
experience when it comes to the SSD
performance that being said let's move
on now to the next SSD so moving on now
to the bx 100 this is a 500 gigabyte
version so if anything it should perform
slightly better than the 256 gigabyte MX
100 though let's get into the benchmark
scores here d sequential reads were
really good over 500 megabytes per
second as good as it gets across that
side of 36 gigabit per second cap there
the write speeds 423 megabytes per
second this scored
quite a bit higher than the MX 100 did
though I'll talk about this a little bit
later the 4k read and writes great
speeds there on the reads the rights
were a little bit slower than the MX 100
and this is one of the most crucial
points or pun intended of a drive where
you want to get a good score even though
it did score slightly slower than the MS
100 that is still a very good score for
desktop usage don't be alarmed that it's
got a little bit slot on MX 186
megabytes per second on those random
right fork a rat's ass is still a really
good score anyway let's look at the
queue depth here we've got mainly we're
looking at the input outputs per second
on the red side of things you can see
that it performed significantly lower
than the MX 100 so that's curious as to
why that is but on the other side of
things it's not too much to worry
because this is more of the queue depth
benchmark of the 426 case 6 64 kilobytes
threaded test is more of a server sort
of benchmark there wouldn't be too
alarmed by it the access x 37
nanoseconds and 38 nanoseconds correct
me if I'm wrong but that is extremely
low that's pretty much as good as it
gets in this regard and both these
scores came together to score a total of
nine hundred and thirty-one nasss DSO
the MX 100 did edge out the bx 100 nasss
d and so that's interesting to note
another thing i wanted to note was the
HD tune protests here we look across the
three different patterns here we can see
on the right side of things here we can
see these dips and they were
consistently coming up I did benchmark
this numerous times to try and if it see
if it was an anomaly but it wasn't this
was these dips are real so this I guess
I can attribute this to the difference
in the controller's the silicon motion
controller is not as good as the Marvel
controller so that's something key to
note however let's move on now to the
final benchmark that's the Intel and you
can see that the bx 100 and the MX 100
will be in a different league compared
to this next SSD so here's the intel 335
240 gigabyte version so you see an
d thus quentel reads were really high as
well though it fell behind in the right
speeds and keep in mind though I have
been using this drive for quite a while
as as well as I have been using my MX
100 so the MX 100 is a very durable dry
very tough drive but the Intel's kind of
starting to show its age here a little
bit and the 4k random read and rates are
still really good as well so it's
nothing to worry about the queue depth
there is not as good as the other two
drives and the other two crucial drives
and the access times are a little bit
slower than both the crucial drives this
came together to score a total of six
hundred and ninety six points moving on
to HD tune-pro and when we get to sort
of the mixed and random data patterns
here we can see that it does have a lot
of dips here I guess this because the
drive does have a lot of information on
it though keep in mind that my MX 100
does have a lot of information on it as
well so they're both running OS is on
them and they both filled up with kind
of similar data so I'm kind of surprised
to see that the sand force was kind of
falling behind by this much in this
particular benchmark okay with those
three benchmarks out the way we can then
look at the two drives that actually
matter so let's look at these two drive
side by side so I decided to pick out
the most important part of HD tune on
both days because I believe it
represents what we're looking at with
these drives we can see here that the
Marvel controller is probably a better
control in general then the silicon
motion though it is important to know
that the silicon motion doesn't look too
bad I could just imagine it once I
started filling it up with a lot of data
you'd probably get even worse so kudos
to Marvel I think they do make the best
controllers at the moment on SSDs what
about Samsung that's probably a question
some of you guys will ask Samsung want
to send me over an SSD to review then
they're more than welcome my door or my
post box is open anytime guys so you're
welcome to send me one over for review
but okay so getting back to the
benchmark scores here we can see that
the MX 100 was edging out the bx 100 in
 d and I mean the access times were
better on the bx 100 and the sequential
writes were slightly better though did
sort of fall a little bit behind in
those 4k write speeds but anyway
something to take out of this is that
the bx 100 is a great drive just the mx1
hundreds a little bit better so if
anything they're both fantastic drives
for the money especially for the end
home
user I think what the important thing to
take out who these benchmarks is is that
the bx 100 if you put it in your home pc
or you put an MX 100 in your home pc
they're both going to do a great job
though i do take preference to the MX
100 just because i've used it for six
months now it's absolutely amazing i
mean these scores are just impressing me
a lot because i've had the chance to put
data on it give it a solid durability
test and it's still performing like a
champion the bx 100 in time i will
report back on it and tell you how
performs but it is looking great just
like the MX 100 is and if anything I've
learned over time to trust crucial every
product I've got from crucial has been
an absolute stellar champion that's one
thing I can take out of my experience
with crucial drives but anyway that
being said let's move on now to a
conclusion for you guys and we'll snap
it up in black and white and make a
solid recommendation for you guys so in
conclusion I sort of found myself liking
the MX 100 even more when then when i
first reviewed it i mean this thing has
held the test of time already six months
of just heavy usage and it still
performs like it did on day one so kudos
to crucial with the MX 100 i mean i fell
in love with this thing when i first got
it and i still am in love with the MX
100 the bx 100 still posted good numbers
but it kind of i mean it didn't shine as
hard with the MX 100 i mean this is the
256 gigabyte version and it was our
performing the 500 gigabyte p x 100 so I
was kind of left at a crossroads here
and like where do I go with this
recommendation and my recommendation is
going to be pretty simple and that is
still the crucial make fantastic drives
for the money I mean if you're looking
for an SSD or you're looking for ddr3
memory ddr4 memory my recommendations
are still the same as they always are
you can go and buy a crucial product and
know that you're getting good value for
money even if you bite at the
recommended retail price which is a
great thing to say about crucial now
clean and cut simple answer for a
recommendation if you can't get the MX
100 then get the bx 100 that would be my
recommendation i do prefer the
x 100 / DP x 100 simply because it's
using that Marvel controller and as you
saw in that HD tune benchmark the MX 100
showed more smoother lines I mean a
little friend here the S the intel SSD
that didn't do too well though to this
credit mean this drives been used a lot
as well so i will say that about this
drive but i mean just yeah i mean both
these drives just kick the living piss
out of this thing so it was a no
comparison so the bx 100 is a great
drive for the money and i can see there
and recommend it if you can't pick up an
MX 100 I just think the MX 100 offers
that better bang for buck even if it is
a little bit more expensive you just got
that Marvel controller there you've got
some more smoother lines on the
benchmark so in a nutshell I think it
would just be plain and simple like this
if you're a business user or you're
using this in a business environment you
might want to look at the MX 100 or even
the new really at least MX 200 though if
you are looking for the cheapest SSD for
your buck then the bx 100 is great for a
end home user so there's no denying that
both drives the great drives i would
have liked to have seen the MX 200 come
through here even if it was a only a 256
gigabyte model that would have been
pretty cool to compare the MX 100
against the MX 200 though as it stands
the MX 100 is still a slightly better
drive than the bx 100 anyway what do you
guys think which one would you prefer
let me know in the comments below I'd
love to hear your thoughts and as always
if you ladies video please give it a
thumbs up and if you haven't already
subscribe to take a city where I'll be
coming back with you to you guys with
more tech reviews and news also one more
thing before I go is that all these
drives the MX 100 the bx 100 and the
Intel they all work together with one
another in Windows 8.1 seamlessly so
there was no conflicts unlike my last
review where the MX 100 refused to work
with the Intel and vice versa in windows
7 and also the speeds were slightly
faster I thought in Windows 8.1 so I
guess that's spells that Windows 8.1
maybe is slightly better for our SSDs
since the OS natively supports SSDs so
anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this
review and I
I'm out of here piece off now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
