just coming back to you guys today with
a review and quality test of these NX
1002 or one zero zero two now this is
pretty much identical to the 8:02 or the
802 and the reason why I think is
because this one has only two extra line
ins than the 802 anyway that's the Box
guys it comes very well packaged I must
admit kudos to bearing or it comes
really well packaged I like the boxing
in solid and it looks good simple and
good so this is the unit itself guys
this is what I'm going to be reviewing
today now before you switch off and say
that is just another review if you have
a computer or a laptop or anything you
may be interested in watching this guys
because this unit and the reason why I
like this unit so much is because it
complements your onboard audio so well
it addresses the weaknesses of onboard
audio and I'm going to have no problems
in recommending these things in my
future $1000 builds guys because they
are so good in basically with the
onboard audio nowadays they've got the
really good Dax and the really good ADCs
but they lack the amplification and this
thing makes up for that by giving you
two microphone preamps which will add up
your microphone and give it a really
noisy signal and also it will give your
headphones a nice boost okay so
basically guys I only leave my headphone
control up one third and it blows my
ears up almost it is unbelievable this
thing is so loud for headphones you'll
get a noiseless really good high signal
from it and it just really complements
it well so let's go over what the
features of this unit now first off
we're going to a quality check and it's
got little souls there that'll you know
they're not rubberized but they are
pretty good they'll grip any surface
pretty well now the bottom is made of
steel so it feels really well built and
all the ports and everything on the
knobs and everything like that feel
really good so these feel really stiff
and they have a center little click to
know that you're in the middle so when
you go to the center and kind of have
this little jig it click and it feels
really good now if you get a closer look
at the microphone preamps here guys
there's got two of these and that
phantom power which means basically that
can take condenser microphones or just
traditional dynamic
microphones or any microphone basically
you know so you can just flick that on
and off so if using and dense microphone
turn that on or power both the ports now
basically it's also got on the
microphone ports equalizers guys so you
can change the hires the mids and the
lows on you know on the fly really
quickly it's also got a low-cut guys so
there's a lot of bass in the background
you can just put that on and we'll cut
the noise off so it'll get only 80 Hertz
and over so now guys let's have a look
here it also you up the FX control if
you're sending in an FX into this you
can you know up the FX signals or lower
room so anyway and then it has the
balance here so obviously if you put it
to the right it's going to focus more on
the right channel left on the left
channel and it's got the level there
which is another volume adjustment to
the gain so it's what the game there
goes and if you turn that all the way up
it's huge it's absolutely massive okay
so this thing will give you massive
volume for your microphone or even
massive amplification but it will start
to get noisy if you put it say up to
about there but I'll do a quality check
later guys and I'll have it at about
these settings so - 25 here - 25 here
and this up two-thirds and this down a
little bit I find this is the best
setting for your microphone and it gives
it really good signal and pretty
noiseless so anyway we'll do that check
later so it's got two of these channels
guys so if you're doing a little podcast
setup and you have people over you in
your room do you want to interview you
can have two microphones going at once
which is very good awesome feature and
allow those signals to your computer so
if your computer's got a line in and a
microphone in which mine does as well
you can actually give it two separate
channels we will go on to that later so
as are you do it all in the one channel
which is what I would do anyway
so you can it gives you a lot of options
basically - now this is another thing if
you're if you've got instruments like
drums or guitars I don't so I don't
really focus on this but it's got more
line ins it's got another additional
eight line ins if you've got the 802
that will give you an extra six line
ends and will cut two of these channels
off but since this is a 1002 it has
eight and extra eight line ins for drums
guitars whatever you put into it and you
can mix it here with the volume levels
it doesn't have the ear cues for these
linings but that's okay for users like
me and you this is perfect
now basically the headphone signal goes
you need a stereo jack adapter which
season this sends a dirt cheap so you
can pick these up you know they threw
all of the $1 a Sony one I found lying
around my house bang and she goes and
your headphones now can go you can you
know amplify your head turns through
this and it'll give you a really quality
you know really high-powered signal so
basically guys this is the way you plug
your headphones in and this is where you
over here to the right is where you plug
in your headphone line in from the
computer so it will come into here sorry
via this one so in will take the
computer in from your signal from your
computer's out and will come into here
and then out will give it the microphone
signal to send out to your computer if
that makes sense
so basically that this is the end for
your headphone this is the headphones to
go see a green plug in your computer
this goes to your readily blue do you
computer and here's the button here that
you want to push in so this here this
button here see the tape true control
room this will send your headphone
signal directly to this control room
here so separate channel which will make
this in go to only one channel one by
itself so you won't hear the microphone
if you turn that off you can hear your
microphone directly now this is an
another really good feature because if
you're not sending the signal to your
computer if I'll send this signal for
instance to my camera it would be direct
okay and I could hear the audio that's
going into my camera without having to
you know delete or play back any
settings so I can do a quality check on
the fly so which is really good guys
really good setting to have now
basically the last thing is yet is the
control room and the last thing i want
to talk about sorry is the main mix it's
got a main mix volume which is your
master volume and that will control the
overall volume so if you see this here
it's also got these lights here to clip
so when it's clipping guys you basically
want to turn this knob down and they'll
you know week and defin the power that's
coming out from your microphone or from
your headphones or whatever so it's
letting you know the signal and that's
it it's clipping us to us you know it's
cutting out its distorting so you don't
want to do that now the power button is
a really light blue like it's really
blue it is very strong but it doesn't
really matter I put mine away from my
computer or honey instead and at
nighttime it's actually pretty cool
gonna lights will place up your room
your dark room with a nice extra blue
light I've got heaps of blue lights on
my computer anyway and the 48 volt power
that's just to let you know when phantom
powers on and off so yes
overall it's got its a feature packed
unit it feels pretty heavy it's about I
think it's a kilo I don't know maybe a
kilogram but it feels really well-built
guys and you know people giving this
thing bad reviews or whatever for noise
whatever you do got to earth it so my
computer's earthed and now this is
plugging directly into my computer and
my computer's earth so basically my kits
getting a noiseless signal so it's
really good guys overall I give this
unit 5 out of 5 if you guys are buying a
new computer nowadays with really good
onboard audio you want to get one of
these they're going out cheap even the
fiber two guys so if you're on the end
of you doing you know occasional YouTube
video and you want your headphones have
a really good signal
get up.get the ZX 502 they're like
twenty five dollars I think they're very
cheap and you know you've got options
for the future if you ever want to get
into you know broadcasting or anything
however all guys I wish I bought this
thing first and just used it from the
get-go I wasted a lot of time with all
these other units and having problems
that this thing is awesome it's unreal I
you're the 5 out of 5
if you want to know any questions about
this guys please let me know in the
comment section below I'll get back to
you as soon as I can and from here on
guys we'll do a quick quality test with
the microphone plugged in too so we'll
just plug that in here
and we'll do a quick quality test guys
with these settings and we'll see how it
sounds hey let's give it a go now and
you guys can see what sir that sounds
like let me know how it sounds
alright hey hey guys so this is the
bearing of B one on the xenix 1002 so
this is just a quality test let me count
to five one two three four five okay so
you may not be able to notice any noise
now let's just do pause for five seconds
and do a noise test
okay so there you have it guys that's
the BAE ring a big one on these NX 1002
now this should be identical to the 802
except the 802 has 2-2 inputs so now
guys I hope you enjoyed this review
today let me know what you think of this
unit it is only $40 I think it's really
cheap they're going out cheap as
everyone's wanting to buy the USB and
audio interfaces but little do people
realize that the onboard audio that
comes with like the ALC Realtek 8 9 2 or
8 9 8 they come with really good ADCs
and DACs guys so take advantage of it
and get yourself one of these and
they'll really complement your onboard
audio extremely well so where you guys
peace out for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
