talking about either risin or Intel and
well today is gonna be no different
we're gonna talk about it as well
so which cpu should you buy in early
2018 well Intel and AMD both have some
good solutions we're gonna talk about
which one could be best for you and why
welcome back to tech yes City this brand
coming to you guys today with that video
talking about AMD's risin and also
Intel's coffee the lake now the last
year AMD have really pulled themselves
out of a rabbit hole to the point where
on the financials they're actually
profitable now so in love years before
that they were taking a hammering they'd
really their CPUs were quite a bit
behind Intel's everyone was building
Intel's especially for gaming PC's
nowadays is a completely different story
AMD have some really competitive
solutions especially in terms of value
for money I'm going to talk about that
risin five sixteen hundred apparently
from the numbers I can see online and
also from speaking to people in real
life at retailers here on the Gold Coast
Verizon v 1600 is selling the best of
all am DS CPUs go on to Intel CPUs I'm
hearing conflicting reports I believe
the 8700 K is selling really well we'll
talk a little bit about that later but
also the 8350 K I believe is selling
quite well for Intel even though I'm not
really gonna be recommending that CPU
here today we've got instead the 8400
which I believe is a lot better volume
will be even better value
once the be 350 - what do they call
those motherboards B 360 motherboards
are gonna be released in the wild but
enough of the chitter chatter today I'm
gonna be recommending you guys 5 brand
new CPUs if you're building a brand new
computer now I know it sucks at the
moment graphics card prices are pretty
high ddr4 prices are pretty high but
eventually or if they come down in sales
in the next few weeks you will be able
to get them for decent prices they're
the only two components that are
overpriced at the moment and building a
new computer is still doable if you can
pick up some deals at decent retailers
who don't want to rip you off but
without aside let's get on with this
list coming in number 5 Verizon 3 1200
you've got here 4 cores 4 threads
overclockable with the included CPU
cooler you can get this thing to 3.8
gigahertz already tested it I absolutely
love the value that it's bringing to the
table there's also the 1300 X from AMD
which comes with a higher clock speed
out of the box and can work with the
cheaper a320 motherboards but if you get
a be 350 mile board you're gonna have
more upgrade ability I think in
the fact that you can overclock and of
course it's gonna be cheaper on the CPU
side of things if you get the 1200
because they're virtually the same CPU
now in games you can expect this to play
all the latest titles you can have no
problems especially if you're just be
looking for 60fps at 1080p or if you're
looking for something to play pub G this
CPU will provide you with that value
that you need now coming in at number
four even though I don't have the box
for it and I got sent a review sample
that's why I don't have the box it's
coming at number four because it's not
the best value for money but it is in my
opinion the best CPU out there at the
moments best in slot this is the 8700 K
if you deal it it you'll generally get
it to 5 gigahertz and over if you don't
deal with it and get it to about 4.8 4.9
no problems it is an absolute monster of
a CPU if you're into doing streaming or
a workhorse all you need the snappiest
cpu available or a course you need the
best frame rates in games but none
then the 8700 k is going to do it for
you I recently switched over from risin
the 1800 X to the 8700 K and I did
notice it was a bit snappier so it is a
beast of a computer it does help my
final render times out a little bit more
than the 1800 X but of course it does
cost more you can expect your wallet to
get a little bit of a fleecing as
opposed to the AMD options but of course
you will get that extra performance
now coming in at number three is AMD's
risin 7 1700 I love this CPU mainly
because of the value that it brings to
the table you can couple it with a big
350 motherboard if you want to but
sometimes the VRMs aren't that good on
some of the be 350 models especially the
budget options so I do recommend getting
an X 370 motherboard if you can and
getting this CPU to 4 gigahertz with a
decent cooler I'd say if you get a water
cooler a 240 ml rad you'll have yourself
some upgrade ability options especially
if you want to get it next gen or the
next next gen rising CPU after that and
this will give you just exceptional
value for money it's a great a core 16
threaded CPU will do fantastic and
everything desktop related generally
around here I've got these 70 900 X I've
also got the 1950 X I don't use either
of those CPUs because they're just too
much for what I do and this is coming
from a guy who renders videos day in day
out and multitask like a bowl so this
CPU under 300 bucks is definitely going
to be a good CPU for your needs though
the included stock cool you can
generally get up to around 3.8 gigahertz
and it's just exceptional value for
money but let's get on to number 2
now coming into number two is the i-4
8400 you can generally get this for
under $200 I love this thing 6 cos 6
threads clocks to 3.8 gigahertz out of
the box with the included cooler which
will keep it around 60 degrees
it only sips power so little it doesn't
use that much power at all but it gets
really good performance it's a very good
sweet spot CPU for people who don't want
to overclock at all they want really
good performance this thing will just
blitz through games you can couple it
with a 1080 of an a-10 atti
your beginning frame rates across all
different games that are absolutely
amazing Pub G if you want to play that
bang no problems if you want to play the
latest Wolfenstein bang so if this CP
will definitely do it for me it'll
definitely do it for you now there was a
bit of controversy with this needing a Z
370 but there will be the B 360s and I'm
sure the h3 tends to follow suit and
when they do this CPU will be much
better value for money than even with a
Z 370 but even with a budget Z 370
motherboard I can still recommend it
it's still very good value for money for
what it is
GL's just saving that for number one but
coming in a number one is the risin 5
1600 phenomenal value for money this is
why I guess number one it's the value
for money King in my opinion sentiment
agrees with me I love this thing before
it was even released I was like damn 6
cores 12 threads on a be 350 motherboard
is gonna be where it's at and it's
exactly where it's at this CPU coming
under $200 a lot of the times with the
included cooler 3.8 gigahertz 6 cores 12
threads so relevant in games so great
for multitasking so good for streaming
this thing is gonna be what you want to
get if you're looking for the best value
for money in the new CPU price
performance sector now of course with
the CPU and performance if you're
playing games you can expect over a
hundred fps in pub G and you just backed
over 100 fps and pretty much all the
games out there if you tuned the games
right on me if you're putting on some of
those intense settings and you graphics
cards tanking you're not gonna be
getting over 100 FPS but if you turn the
settings down in your graphics card then
the CPUs gonna be like hey yo I can do a
little bit more now and you will get a
little bit more so that's what risin 5
1600 can do for you and your life pretty
good value for money come to number one
as I said before all the choices here
that I've mentioned are my top 5 picks
for early 2018 now I will talk about the
x4 70 which is soon to be released in
the rise and refresh they're going to be
even better value for money in my
opinion so you can if you want you can
if you got to be 350 motherboard now or
you get a x3 70 motherboard now you'll
be able to upgrade to the next refresh
but even so if you can pick these up for
a really good price then the new Verizon
refresh is only really gonna bring
higher clock speeds it's not going to do
a whole lot in terms of performance
you're just gonna hopefully get around
about 10% extra hopefully you're gonna
get around 4.3 4.4 gigahertz out of the
new gen Raisins but with that they're
coming out in the next few months I
believe I'm not entirely sure yet but I
will let you guys know and you'll
probably see some reviews on the channel
as soon as they drop now of course
should you wait for that that's up to
you ddr4 Ram prices could get even worse
than that time GPUs might even be in a
super sold out phase we just don't know
things of course could get better with
the rise and refresh which I do believe
they actually will
next couple of months so it may be worth
waiting out for if you can that's what I
always recommend if there's something
just around the corner especially a
couple of months away then I always
recommend just holding out if you can
and then jumping on that latest and
greatest as soon as it comes out anyway
guys hope you enjoyed today's video if
you did then be sure to hit that like
button let me know in the comments
section as well do you agree with
today's list and my sentiments and if
you disagree let me know why love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always and another thing about aimed a
quarter for 2017 financial results there
are a lot better of a spot as we talked
about in the intro profits actually
coming into the company now even with
the console sales down it looks like AMD
CPU divisions doing really well and also
that cryptocurrency mining phase is
definitely helped out there graphics
card division 2 so they're in a better
spot a lot better spot than they were a
year or even two years ago so that's
great to see
AMD back in the game and I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye because they're
just too much for what I do and I read
it and I read it now coming in number 2
is the 80 and I render a multi spot and
I render in Adobe Premiere ped</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
