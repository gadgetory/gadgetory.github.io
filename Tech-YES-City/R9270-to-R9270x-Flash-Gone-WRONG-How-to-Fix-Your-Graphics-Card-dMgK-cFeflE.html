flash on my r9 270 trying to flash it to
an r9 270x and it just simply would not
work after I flashed it though there was
one technique that I used to bring this
thing back to life and I'm going to
share that with you guys today
welcome back to check yeah City this is
brian coming to you guys today with a
video on how you can possibly bring some
dead gravy's cards back to life now this
applies to a few different graphics
cards that just simply don't work at the
set voltage and clock speeds and in my
case I did have an r9 270 which I tried
to flash to an r9 270x and as it just
happened it was just not Bend high
enough and that it wouldn't work at the
said clock speeds at the said voltage so
there was a little method and a trick
that I could use to bring it back down
and that was to have a motherboard that
supported the base clock on an Intel
platform and what this enables you to do
is essentially down clock everything
including the graphics card so what I
managed to do was I managed to down
clock it to 75 Hertz or megahertz and
that essentially dropped the graphics
card speed down 25% as well and when I
did that I was able to flash it back to
the r9 270 which then enabled my
graphics card to work again so the
lesson I learned here was that not all
r9 270 s r9 270 X's and they can't all
be flashed to be better or free
performance as they are essentially some
of them I guess are essentially Bend
though this trick doesn't just go as far
as to work on a bad flash you'll notice
that from time to time people will start
selling graphics cards that no longer
work and if you get one of these
graphics cards in you can see if it just
runs at a low base clock and if so it's
probably just a higher Bend or
aggressively bend card that just doesn't
work at that set voltage anymore so
you'll be able to flash a new BIOS on
and you put perhaps have yourself a very
cheap graphics card the one thing you
keep in mind if your computer does crash
while you are flashing your graphics
card then that card is pretty much dead
unless it's got a dual BIOS on there
however don't imagine this really
happening to anyone as the V bios in my
case took like a second or two to flash
it was almost instantaneous and I don't
imagine anyone trying to flash expensive
graphics cards on a potato that's about
it for me today guys if you want to see
more videos like this and be sure to hit
that thumbs up button and stay
subscribed and I'll catch you guys in
the next Tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
