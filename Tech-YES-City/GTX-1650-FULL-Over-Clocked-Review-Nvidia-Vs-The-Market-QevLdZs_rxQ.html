you and I but a mere seed in this market
however we can be good seeds and if
enough good seeds make up a market then
that would otherwise be known as a good
market on the other hand however you and
I could also be a bad seed and if enough
bad seeds make up the market then it
would be otherwise known as a bad market
what we've got here on the desk is the
gtx 1650 and it has been receiving quite
the blasting from a lot of outlets on
its price it's coming in at 150 dollars
currently MSRP and at this particular
price point there is the competition
from AMD with their RX 570 coming into
law price point and offering more
performance but make no mistake about it
the same bad market that is making this
gtx 1650 look like bad value is the same
market that is making the RX 570 brand
new that is at its current price point
and this has to do all with the reverse
situation from a year ago where we saw
the cryptocurrency boom in effect and
all those brand new graphics cards were
priced quite high fast forward to this
year however and the graphics cards have
done a 180 and in fact all those cards
from last year are now being dumped onto
the market especially the RX 5 70's and
5 80s due to the fact that aetherium
mining in particular to the RX series is
no longer in fashion I myself have seen
n got good deals on a lot of used RX 5
seventies and even to this date on
Taobao or Taobao if you want to give it
a bit of a chinese move these sites are
selling this graphics card quite cheap
under that of the hundred dollars most
the times so at these price points this
is indeed giving the market Dominator
Nvidia a run for its money quite
literally and that's what the beautiful
thing about a free market is when any
single entity attempts to control it
they will be met with some negative
sentiment and that is what this card is
receiving here and it's mainly jus
simply to the market conditions but with
that aside at 150 dollars what traits
does this card have what are things that
I'd like to see improved on it and is it
indeed worth that price tag well let's
the numbers and then we'll get back to
this tech yes desk and also in case
you're wondering yes I am wearing
glasses very light prescription does
help me see better at night time
especially when it's later at night and
my eyes get tired
so you think back to the 1650 right here
we have the galaxy' dition and also the
gigabyte edition now this weighs in
under 400 grams you get a little bit
less PCB you get also different
DisplayPort options but honestly the
Galax option is coming just under 500
grams it's got a beefier cooler does
better on the temperatures and noise
coming in at 60 degrees at 100% fan
speeds and then moving down to 63
degrees at 80% 67 degrees at 60% and
also the auto fan speeds made it go to
63% and the noise levels were one
decibel lower so the 60% manual fan
speed sees like the sweet spot for this
graphics card in 26 degree ambient
controlled environments but going now
through the gaming benchmark numbers and
I did get criticized for having too many
nvidia titles in the previous video so i
decided to flood this one with AMD
titles hope that makes you happy fanboys
out there but regardless we can see that
the rx 570 is indeed a better choice if
you are looking for raw price
performance now of course the car does
juice more power and I have heard
arguments of you can under volt it you
can under clock it but part of my
experience which in turn has affected my
outlook from 2018 coming into 2019 is
that I like to give the average person
buying advice in the form of a
recommendation and so the average person
coming to this review I'm sure really
doesn't have the time nor the patience
to learn how to undervolt and whether
they want to take that performance hit
is up to them so I do like to keep
things simple even when it comes to
overclocking because that is what the
majority of people I believe are doing
though I will make a separate video
looking at under vaulted rx 570 and
comparing it against the 1650 and also
the 1660 and a previous gen Nvidia card
to see where the power consumption
average is out at the same frame rates
that is something you have requested now
one thing about the 1650 however is that
it is pretty much reaching its PCIe
power limit drawer in my opinion the
card here on the gallic side of things
didn't really go above its wattage and
so I believe it's over clocks were
limited there
pcie 6-pin models that will push above
this and we'll get better FPS though
again at the detriment of having a six
pin power connector included on the card
however my biggest critiquing points of
this card are going to be different to
that of other reviewers or they might be
the same I don't know I haven't watched
their reviews so I don't want to get any
outside influence
but without aside the gaming benchmarks
showed that the power consumption was a
lot better though the rx 570 did come
out ahead in every single title whether
it be an Nvidia title or an AMD title it
simply was a better performing card the
1660 also proved for its extra $70 that
it is a much better price performance
option considering has much more CUDA
cores and it also has higher clock
speeds which at least in these 1650s are
tested here may have been clock speed
bound due to that 75 watt TDP limit
there now let's quickly move on to the
recommendations from an objective
standpoint who would this card be for
and why the only current market I can
think of is someone who wants to keep
power consumption down but still wants
decent FPS and they don't mind paying a
hundred and fifty dollars if you are in
a country with high power consumption
costs and you are going to be using this
card significantly for the use of its
life take for instance if you're gaming
on what a Warcraft and you're using this
card for a very extended period of time
day and day out then over time those
savings for the power can make it a
better value for money option than nrx
570 though again how many people play
World of Warcraft for 16 hours a day I'm
not too sure this could also be a good
option for someone with a PC that's
maybe four or five years old but they
know has a decent four-course CPU and it
can handle a GPU upgrade and they may be
concerned about the other components in
their system say for instance they only
have a 350 watt power supply and they
don't want to chop and change things too
much then it could be a decent option
though those two markets aside let's get
on to the critiquing points and the
first thing that does bother me about
the 1650 is the progression of the cart
itself two and a half years in the
making not really giving a whole boost
over the 1050 TI having the same vram
and yet using more power than its little
predecessor also upon testing out the
streaming performance I was quite
surprised that this does indeed have the
volta nvidia encoder built on board so
that's the previous generation so even
though it has chirring cuda cause it is
not benefiting from the chirring encoder
that has been built into the gtx 1660
and above and even onto the RT x cards
when it was first released this does
give a better more efficient encoding
process especially if you're gonna be
streaming on Twitch at 6,000 kilobits
per second the second last point i'm
gonna critique is that there's no low
profile option that's when the card
actually has a shallower depth therefore
allowing it to fit into much smaller
cases with ease and in turn turning some
sleeper pieces into otherwise gaming
piece the last point however is the
biggest and most missed opportunity of
the 1650 in my opinion and I don't know
if others have talked about this but I
feel like with the experience of me
doing what I do in the use market a
couple with the fact that NVIDIA stands
in the market to only gain from doing
this is something that perplexes me and
that is the UEFI biases on board these
cards I would like to see in video give
the partners the option to integrate a
legacy BIOS but somehow gets these GPUs
working on all HP motherboards Dells
aces things that don't have the option
to turn on CSM or disable secure boot if
they did that this would make a whole
new market for those old OEMs as well as
put this thing in a very good position
in terms of its popularity and if you
end up getting one of these in an old
OEM system you may come into problems
your mileage may vary with that so in
conclusion with the gtx 1650 first off
me to give props to Galax they always
seem to make a solid looking card that
not only looks solid but feels solid as
well it's got the performance to match
got the thermals and of course it comes
in at the MSRP they always seem to do a
good job of hitting that though in terms
of the actual SKU itself the 1650 here
it's one of those things where NVIDIA
has proven to the market that it can't
control the market and currently the
market conditions are that of a buyers
market so if you want to be selling your
cards then you have to maybe follow suit
in what AMD is doing and make no mistake
AMD don't want to sell an rx 570 at 130
US dollars brand-new that want to sell
it at a higher price but they simply
those four the GTX 1658 150 dollars I'm
not that impressed with it and in fact I
think it's only for someone who's
looking for power efficiency all that
other market that we mentioned before
someone that's looking to replace their
old potato GPU and doesn't want to
change other components in their current
setup but once an FPS boost other than
that there are such when taking points
which I mentioned before that I'd like
to see Nvidia improve on and this card
would have went from mediocre to
somewhere of the likes of wow it's
pretty cool for a lot of things but I
feel like it missed that mark and with
that said I hope you enjoyed today's
review an alternative look at the gtx
1650 with that said if you did be sure
to hit that like button and i'll catch
you in another tech video very soon but
before you jump on out of here do drop a
comment and let us know what you think
of this review my thoughts and opinions
and what you think of the gtx 1650 love
reading each and every one of your
feedback each and every one of yous
yours I don't know it's getting pretty
late
my brain is dropping out right now and
I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
