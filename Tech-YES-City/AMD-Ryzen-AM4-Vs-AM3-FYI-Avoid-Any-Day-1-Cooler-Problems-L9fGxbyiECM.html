benchmarks rigged for you guys and I'm
happy to say I'll get you guys some day
1 coverage on March 2nd so stay tuned
for that however there was one little
thing that I ran into that I just wanted
to give you guys like an FYI oh for your
information so let's take a look what
exact attack yes city this brand coming
to you guys today with a quick video on
just the a.m. for cooler compatibility
and what's going to happen guys so if
you've gone out and pre-ordered your
rising CPU you're going to get your
motherboard just be aware that on day
one a lot of the bolt down coolers with
a m3 compatibility actually won't fit
and for motherboards now talked about
this with Steve from Hardware unboxed is
sent me a photo in Andy has confirmed
that the a m3 raised cooler will fit the
a m4 socket so it looks like a lot of
those latch down coolers will fit the a
m4 socket however I know that bolt down
coolers will unfortunately not fit the a
m4 platform unless the motherboard
manufacturers have the am 3 holes
drilled out as well as the aim for holes
so the aim three holes are a little bit
longer in length they're kind of a
similar structure but I found that I had
to zip-tie my cooler down and I've
tested out quite a few coolers around
here too by the way I even managed to
get this cooler master 212 to almost fit
it's just that I would have had to
pretty much ruin the bracket to get it
fit in even only one diagonal direction
so just a little FYI for you guys if you
are buying a cooler on day one make sure
that it fits and for if not and you can
wait a little bit then I'm sure a lot of
the cooler manufacturers will be
bringing out brackets and they will be
sending them out hopefully for free to
you guys if you already have an
expensive cooler I generally find that
the bigger air coolers and also the all
in ones tend to bolt down so these are
the ones that will generally have the
compatibility issues because you have to
bolt them down from the top and you will
need those a and four holes lined up I
mean if you want to drill things or zip
ties things which I don't recommend that
you can do it but I'm only doing because
I want to get you guys day one coverage
so stay tuned for that if you have any
questions you guys be sure to drop a
comment the comment section below don't
forget to hit that like button and of
course if you dislike this video
to get to slam that dislike button and
I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon please now for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
