to be extremely easy we put this
together in the recent parts hunt that
we did where we got this whole i7 system
for around about 220 astraying dolls
which would be about 170 USD then to top
all that off in the same parts hunt we
managed to pick up a gtx 1050 ti4 110
Australian dollars or if you're in the
u.s. 85 USD so this lay of the total of
this build to 330 Australian or 250 USD
so extremely good value for money and
now something like this is the easiest
way to get into PC gaming and it also
represents some of the best price
performance you can get in this case
we've got a hate to PB you could add and
get a Dell with a fork or a gigabytes of
RAM hard drive motherboard or
pre-installed and then just chuck in a
low power consuming graphics card like a
GTX 1050 or 1050 Ti you've got yourself
a really good gaming PC however this
month I wanted to do something different
with the video for you guys and that's
sort of take you through a step-by-step
process of what I do when I get these
pcs how I tuned them up and also how I
overclock them and then how I test in
the games walking back to tech yesterday
the first thing I like to do when I get
the PCs that come through here is do a
fresh install of Windows 10 to get rid
of all the crap and also with that you
can get a cheap key off of kinguin but
I'm finding a lot of the pieces that I
get through here already have Windows 10
installed so it's just a simple matter
of going in resetting windows completely
and then after you've reset windows I
like to optimize it so you get rid of
all the unwanted programs all the
unwanted apps disable some services turn
it in high-performance mode even going
to Windows Defender and disable some
cloud-based services I've got all these
settings and tips in a video which I'll
put in the link in the description below
the Windows 10 optimization guide and I
will be releasing a full creators update
guide for you guys soon so stay tuned
for that and now after this I then start
copying over my games but I also get the
latest drivers whether it be the AMD or
Nvidia drivers and also afterburner and
River tuner now these two programs go
hand-in-hand with UniGene Heaven UniGene
Hammonds a quick benchmark that you can
load up to test overclock sand with
afterburner
you just have to move a few sliders
change the settings to boot with Windows
unlock voltage control and then
understable overclock and then save that
to a profile and every time you boot to
Windows you will now have your graphics
card overclocked which of course is the
most important thing for gamers and what
quickly pause on this topic and talk
about the settings that are using games
and now this is a big reason why I get
high smooth frame rates that look really
good is because I play on high settings
and I disable some very taxing settings
in games and in my opinion this gives a
still very good visual quality in the
game but also gives you very smooth
frame rates a lot of people are
constantly asking me in the comments how
do you get such good performance out of
your low budget pcs they run better than
my i5 and GTX 970 for example and I've
got a better SPECT computer than you and
the answer is really just tuning the
games as well as the system and that's
two things that go hand-in-hand to give
you guys a really good experience when
you're gaming and so with this 1050 Ti I
believe we'll be able to hit around
about 100 fps and some of these titles
that were installing though of course
we'll wait till we test the games and
now another thing I like to do after
I've overclocked everything is run I 264
and basically what this does is will
tell us if the temperatures are okay
both on our CPU and our GPU I find it's
also an extremely real-world benchmark
versus some of these other overclocking
utilities that can just stress your CPU
way too hard or even your GPU and it's
not as real-world as either 64 it'll
just give you a power consumption figure
but it finds very accurate and also
temperatures that are very accurate
well with that said if there is a
problem with the stress test at night at
64 then I'll go back and do things like
change some thermal paste on the GPU or
CPU and then make sure that either 64 is
running completely stable before I even
boot up into any games so as I said
before overclocking with afterburner one
of the most important things you can do
on a gaming PC of course we take our
power limits and temperature limits up
and keep in mind we are in a 24 degree
ambient environment here
sometimes even the summer for example
you may not be able to achieve the
overclocks I'm getting here with that
said the boost clock on the core was
actually quite high on this 1050 Ti
though the memory clocks were very low I
think was hitting 7 gigahertz per second
effective memory speeds so that means
we've got a lot more in the tank for
memory speed so we're gonna try plus 700
because usually you can get at least a
gig
so that's plus 500 so with this we can
take this all the way up to around about
700 I think we'll be fine
fan speeds 80% you can even hear it in
the background it's not loud at all so
we're gonna go for this first Oh see
here with plus 61 plus 715 so let's see
if this crashes we'll say this as five
so I'd like to save my testing profiles
over here and then my stable profiles
over here
so now we've got here is an overclock
that's been running for a minute or two
and it's actually looking really stable
there's no glitching basically if you
get artifacting that's when the screens
going crazy
that'll mean either the memories
overclock too aggressively and if the
core is usually overclock too
aggressively the program will just start
flickering and crash out so with this we
can see that we've got a relatively
stable overclock here I think this is
good to go so we might even want to give
it a little bit more of a boost and see
if we can extract out of this GPU
because it's looking pretty good I mean
the effective overclock on the GPU is
actually pretty high so we'll start
tuning that we gave it an extra 70
megahertz so we'll see if it passes
because you should generally do one
thing at a time it's just that I'm fast
tracking these overclocks and with
UniGene as you can see here you can get
an overclock on your GPU and literally
10 or 15 minutes and you know that's
sometimes like 10 to 20 percent extra
performance so tune that in lock it in
and it's happy days so I was literally
just about to cut the video but we can
see here this this is crashed clearly so
what this means is that our overclock is
now too aggressive so we can try to one
of two things we can try up the core
voltage and see if that will give it
extra juice to be able to work at a
higher clock speed or we can just lower
the clocks to what we had it before so
we can try around that extra 50
millivolt see if that runs but then
again the overclock we had before again
was extremely good already so I'm not
going to complain about that so that
overclock was basically unstable so 130
mega Hertz plus on the core just did not
work properly so we're going to give it
now 87 and see if we can maybe take it
to a hundred on the core so that's
working okay so quickly again this is a
super fast track overclock I'm doing and
this is how I usually overclock with my
GPUs nowadays it's so easy to find a
quick overclock on your computer and
keep in mind UniGene heavens probably
not the most stressful of GPU
applications and see what we got here is
something happening here I don't know if
that's I've never seen that bug before
but any
there it is so it works fine so plus 99
megahertz on the court is pretty good
now as I was saying before UniGene
heavens not the most stressful but it's
the most quickest in my opinion just
load it up it'll quickly test if it
crashes out it's easy to restart
unlike programs like fire strike which
are really tedious sometimes you have to
restart your computer so this is the
really the fast trackers dream to GPU
overclocking so what we've got here is
now 2075 megahertz and that's looking
pretty good like I'm happy with that
because we tested 130 and so we may be
able to get an extra 10 megahertz but
there's really nothing in it so that's a
pretty good overclock we're now we're
just gonna go really aggressive super
aggressive on the memory because that
will be oh yeah 9 Giga 9 gigabits per
second no gigahertz so there we have it
we've got the maximum memory overclocks
are actually working as confirmed up in
the top right hand corner and the GPUs
at 2075 megahertz this is actually a
really good 1050 Ti we got here and
knowing that we only paid yeah what 85
bucks for it like damn like what a
bargain that's that's crazy so basically
what we're doing now is actually running
the full benchmark this will take quite
a while but if it passes the full
benchmark we'll be able to see the
average temperatures also be able to see
if these overclocks are relatively
stable so there we go the first run it
passed it completely fine it's just
hitting 50 degrees which is really good
for the temperatures the noise is really
low and also the overclocks are really
high on this GPU this is actually a
pretty good sample that the person sold
on gumtree so the last test we're going
to do of course is run it in AI 264 just
for about 20 minutes make sure the
system is completely stable with these
overclocks and make sure the
temperatures aren't overloading the case
however one thing I will say that the HP
business or server grade desktops do is
they do do a good job of having good
airflow so I believe you've got one fan
in the front one at the back and also
the power supply itself is working as an
outtake as well so to it out takes one
intake so we just finished tuning this
PC to its maximum potential and the
temperatures are okay the GPU
temperatures are really good which is
what I'm happy with the CPU is going up
around 80 degrees so it may need its
thermal paste to be changed but
really not a problem in any real-world
tests especially when we're gaming not
going to be a problem also with the side
panel on versus off there was really no
difference in the temperatures so we're
just going to leave the side panel on of
course that's better with dust
management as well in this case but with
that aside one thing I was really
disappointed with was the voltages I
couldn't change anything so the CPU was
going around 1.3 volt which is really
high for a 3.5 gigahertz clock on this
CPU so it actually might even not be the
thermal pace that needs to be changed
could just be it's running high voltages
which is causing high temperatures on
the CPU per se and also on the memory
1333 megahertz is a pretty low clock I
went into the bias to try and change the
memory speeds and also the voltages on
the CPU and there was nothing there to
be able to turn this PC but without a
side let's see how this thing will
perform in these games
so right beside me 250 dollars of use
price performance and it is running so
well so easy to put together if you guys
want to get a PC like this all you have
to do is buy one of these OEMs off eBay
Craigslist Gumtree wherever you can get
it from and then whack in a GTX 1050 Ti
or even a 1060 and you'll be having
happy days as we saw it here today
destiny 2 was getting around out 100
frames per second with a field of view
of 105 and a custom blend of high medium
and low settings this is how I like to
play this game very smooth frame rates
the ddr3 memory at 1333 megahertz wasn't
affecting performance in this game and
we saw this with Cod as well world war
two that latest Cod this was running
extremely well on this PC - scoring
around about that 100 frame mark as well
and what we saw with the river tuner
statistics was the percentages of the
CPU and the GPU were going near max all
the time so this was a really well
optimised game I'm surprised the good
job that they've done with Cod this time
around because previous cards have been
terribly optimized this was really
smooth even on a computer like this for
250 bucks it was running really well
high low settings custom field of view
85 the performance was not only
impressive but the gameplay itself was
really smooth I was having a good time
on the latest Cod on PC though you guys
are probably wondering there has to be a
catch at this kind of money surely a
$250 PC can't perform this good and
there is one catch and I did find this
in pub G when I was playing this at
1080p settings high it was running
pretty well there was the occasional
stutter but when I dropped it down to
low and very low settings to try and
extract some better performance out of
this game this was when I came into a
little bit of a problem the GPU
utilization was hovering between 60 to
80% a lot of the times and the CPU
utilization was still under 80% a lot of
the times - and so what this means was
there as a bottleneck somewhere else and
this is where that ddr3 1333 megahertz
memory is causing problems specifically
in pub G so one thing I'd like to do if
I could do it again was maybe to get an
overclockable motherboard with this same
configuration and just see if those
memory speeds do make a difference which
I believe they will and a fun fact here
was when I ran Sidda bench we got a
score of 600
and also 3dmark fire strike we've got
8800 points on the CPU and around a
similar score on the GPU however a Z on
the $30 on from Aliexpress a generation
behind if you overclock this to four
gigahertz you can get around 10 K
physics scores so those old Zealand's
they are really good price performance
and they can even outperform the i7 2600
non overclockable CPU however you can of
course get an i7 2600
of the xeon x 34 50s it's not only do
they have better IPC but they overclock
a lot higher too in general anyway I
hope you all enjoyed today's video if
you did then be sure to hit that like
button and let me know what you think in
the comment section below of this 250
dollar PC would you change things up
would you do things differently I'd
honestly like to add in a gtx 1060 if I
could I believe the power supply it will
handle it and also I'd love to just
overclock that memory and tune the CPU
and undervolt
if I could and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
