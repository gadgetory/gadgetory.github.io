saying why are you doing that to see if
I'm dreaming because I am D make my
dreams come true here is Zen too and you
guys have been waiting for this one just
like me for a very long time and AMD has
delivered with something that is so
phenomenal because it hits on pretty
much all four fronts that you would want
to hit if you're an enthusiast for
instance the first hit is the IPC
improvement AMD promises 15% from my
calculations here at least comparing it
to the previous rise in 2000 chips we're
looking at about a 13 percent raw IPC
increase this also puts it above that of
Intel making AMD the IPC King now in
enthusiast tech the second front that
they've hit hot on is also the power
efficiency going to seven nanometer has
had some big improvements with the news
into chips also being the power
efficiency King in the desktop scene the
third front AMD is also hit for
enthusiasts is better clock speeds on
average with the horizon 730 700 X and
also the rise in 930 900 X here I
managed to get four point three
gigahertz on all cores on both CPUs now
I did manage to start running a
benchmark of 4.4 gigahertz
however the CPU did top out and from
what I've spoken with with other
reviewers behind the scenes and also
speaking directly to a Zeus where
they've sampled a lot of raisins and two
chips the norm is about 4.3 gigahertz on
all caused so that means we've got a
boost in clock speeds a boost in IPC and
also power efficiency then the fourth
front AMD have also hit hard on is new
features in particular PCIe Jen for when
I tested this with the included nvme
drive the two gigabyte horas m2 the
scores were phenomenal with the read
speeds and write speeds with practically
no dips whatsoever this means that if
you
need PCIe Gen four speeds whether you're
an 8k video editor or if you're just an
enthusiast that wants the quickest load
times possible then this is going to
deliver as well there was that aside
let's run the benchmarks for you guys
and show who the new king is in town and
that is AMD where I'm comparing this CPU
against an overclocked to ninety nine
hundred K as well as an i-5 ninety four
hundred F and also the previous
generation rise in seven twenty seven
hundred X and risin five twenty six
hundred both o'clock to four point two
gigahertz now the test bench that I had
here we also had two eight gigabyte
sticks of CL 16 thirty-six hundred
megahertz memory which are used across
all test systems and all chips I also
used a three hundred and sixty
millimeter water cooler for the AMD
chips whilst for the test bed I used the
x5 70 horas master as well as
cross-checking that with the x5 70 Tai
Chi from asrock and then on the Intel
side we use the Phantom gaming X Z 390
and we use the same memory as well as
using the H 115 I RGB Platinum cooler
and then for the graphics card we're
using the RT X xx atti from Oris to weed
out any CPU differences so strap on in
and let's roll those benchmarks
so there's the benchmarks all done but
we're going to focus on the gaming
numbers first and talk about those where
I tested at 1080p high settings or ultra
settings depending on the game across
six titles that I considered very CPU
dependent especially coupled with a
twenty atti first of all we'll pull up
csgo which is a very raw latency
dependent game and we can see here that
the rise in seven thirty seven hundred X
as well as the rise in nine thirty nine
hundred X pulls comfortably ahead of the
previous generation rise in chips as
well as competing head-to-head with the
Intel chip the ninety nine hundred K at
five gigas this is pretty much the max
my ninety nine hundred K will go and
I'll quickly pull up the power
consumption results for you guys
which really shows how much more
efficient the rise and chips are when
you overclock them and even out of the
box with the precision boost over trove
- now speaking of precision boost
overdrive - it is enabled on the x5
seventy boards by default I tested an X
370 board here where it was actually
disabled but that being said it's so
easy to just go into the BIOS lock in an
old core 4.1 gigahertz overclock and
then use that with a wraith spire cooler
bringing so much value for money out of
the 3,700 X which will then get similar
results to the results I've shown here
but for what it's worth the results
you're seeing here in today's video is
what you can expect if you go out and
get an x5 70 board and couple it with
the new Rison 3000 chips
the precision boost overdrive - quite
simply works phenomenally well pulling
up some of the other gaming benchmarks
for instance GTA 5 show that it's coming
so close to the Intel chips however the
9900 K in this instance was breaking the
game engine so there's 1% 0.1% loes is
due to the fact that the 9900 K is still
pulling ahead by a little bit and it
gets to that threshold I believe it's
around 170 average FPS where it then
starts breaking the engine but now
moving on with dota 2 we can see that
the 3,700 X is really a shining star for
the gaming benchmarks where it's pulling
ahead of the previous generation
chips and also with that PBO to enabled
it's pretty much staying at the same
level as the 3900 X and in fact the old
core clock 4.3 gigahertz you'll see in
some of these gaming benchmarks did
trade blows with the out-of-the-box PPO
to settings which makes PPO 2 an awesome
thing for people who just want to go out
get an x5 70 board get these new chips
and then couple it with a water cooler
or even the race spy cooler where that
did a really good job of handling the
CPU too but next up here is shadow of
the Tomb Raider where the 9900 K did
still come ahead by a little bit but we
can see with the rise in 730 700 X yet
again it's pulling well above that of
the previous generation Verizon 2000
chips so it's doing a great job of
delivering really good gaming benchmarks
the 3900 X as you can see is still
trading blows with the 3700 X but we'll
get onto the productivity numbers in a
second where you can see that that's
where that specialty of that 12 core
chip pulls ahead where the next numbers
we've got here is Far Cry new dawn where
this did show the biggest difference
between these CPUs but the Rison 3000
chips are still performing phenomenally
well given that the 9900 K does have a
significant boost in clock speeds the
last title we got for you guys is Tom
Clancy's the division 2 where the rising
chips were doing the best they've ever
done in these multi-core CPU dependent
benchmarks pulling well ahead of that of
its previous generation rising 2000
chips and coming so close to that of the
9900 K it's really just a negligible
difference so when it comes down to with
the gaming benchmarks this was pretty
much a strenuous test and I do emphasize
this again where we're extracting the
biggest difference in these games based
on cpu demand and on that note if you
look at a lot of other titles take for
instance apex legends there would be no
difference between these CPUs
furthermore you've got the power
efficiency there of the rise in 3,000
chips which is doing the best out of
this stack the risin 7 3700 X would
easily be my pick for people who are
even going to couple this CPU with a 20
atti and want to get the best FPS but
also save a lot more power compared to
that of the 9900 K granted the 9900 K
will have a
niche markets still and that is for
competitive gamers who are playing for
big money and they need the absolute
most frame draw possible but still again
your road build up to those competitive
gamers and matches the Zen to is going
to make sure you're not losing matches
whatsoever they're very good CPUs that
are delivering so well in gaming and
that's jude not just to the IPC increase
but also the latency reduction AMD made
a big note at their keynote earlier at
CES focusing on the latency drop of the
Rison 3000 series and pulling up some
latency results in I 264 for you guys
you can see that it does have
improvements over that of the previous
rise in 2000 series and in some cases it
is beating the Intel chips too it's also
worth pointing out that the 3900 X
although that did phenomenally well in
today's benchmarks for gaming it's going
to be more suited to productivity where
it didn't really score any extra over
the 3700 X and the 8 core 16 thread
proposition is going to be very valid
for years to come granted we coupled
this with a 20 atti which is currently
the best gaming GPU you can get for
games and on that note we did as we said
before focus on those CPU demanding
titles so out of this bunch of CPUs here
the Rison 730 700 X gets the big tech
yes not of approval but let's move over
now to the productivity benchmarks where
the Rison 930 900 X really starts to
spread its wings and we see here with
vr8 it's just coming well ahead of
everything else and the Rison 730 700 X
is really coming close to the 9900 K and
we're going to keep in mind here that
it's doing so whilst drawing a lot less
power and that's going to be a
consistent trend you're going to see
through another benchmark and all the
other productivity benchmarks who will
pull up Cinebench r20 here where again
the numbers are so close both on the
single core thread score as well as the
multi-core threaded score and then the
riser 9 3900 X just pulls ahead of
everything and granted that costs a
similar price to the 9900 case you're
getting much more bang for your buck
with the new rising 3000 chips then you
are with the Intel
chips for productivity moving over to
Adobe Premiere Pro CC 19 we can see here
that the Rison 3900 X is beating the
9900 K and then the 3,700 X is coming so
close to that of the 9900 K again making
it a phenomenal choice for people who
want to edit 4k videos and get really
good productivity for the dollar
the next benchmark we're going to pull
up here is 7-zip both compression and
decompression benchmarks where the 3900
X comes out on top and then the 3700 X
is beating that of the 9900 K so it's
doing a lot better here especially in
terms of value for money and then moving
over to Geekbench Multi for we can see
here that the Intel does score the
victory in the single core thread but
the 3700 X does edged it out in the
multi-core test and then the 3900 X is
flying well ahead and then pulling up
the corona 1.3 render benchmark we see
here again the 3900 exit flying well
ahead and then the 3700 X trading blows
with the 9900 K both overclocked and out
of the box and then the last benchmark
for you guys in terms of productivity is
the DaVinci Resolve 16 a different video
editing software to Premiere Pro 3900 X
comes out on top 3,700 X trading blows
with the 9900 K and then that summarizes
the productivity benchmarks in a
nutshell but what we can see with the
precision boost overdrive too is that
it's scoring very similar in both the
productivity numbers and the gaming
numbers to that of the overclocks that
we managed to get here but doing so with
less power so basically if you're an
enthusiast it's not a bad option to go
out and get a good cooler or even use
the Wraiths spire in the case of the
3,700 X and just enjoy your CPU and
motherboard combo because it's going to
give out phenomenal performance out of
the box and we can see that with the
power consumption favoring that of PBO -
I didn't have any stability issues while
I was here testing was a breeze
- so AMD have really hit the nail on the
head with Zen - it's such an exciting
time to be an enthusiast as we pointed
out before but with that said let's go
over some other details between these
CPUs and give you guys the ultimate
so they're always with the benchmarks
they do all the talking of course I can
advocate what I've seen here today and
that is just simply a new king is in
town it's so good to see that AMD have
been working on their rise and chips and
just constantly bettering them over the
generations
I like the rise in 2000 chips over the
1,000 and now I like the rise in 3,000
chips a lot more than I like the 2000
over the 1000 series they delivered on
just all fronts that an enthusiast would
want an AMD haven't left us in the lurch
with no IPC gains or anything else for
years unlike what Intel have been doing
with their CPUs since the 6th generation
skylake so in a nutshell Zen 2 is legit
as being legit gets AMD have just
delivered and they've delivered so hard
that it's such a breath of fresh air for
enthusiasts like myself and I'm hoping
most you guys out there because this
just means that we've got better value
as consumers both buying new products
and now of course with used products
they're going to come down in accordance
and another good thing is is the
backwards compatibility granted you will
have to update the BIOS on your older
motherboard but you will be able to
update especially if you've got things
like a be 350 or an X 370 you will be
able to get the Rison 730 700 X and at
least with what I've seen with the
testing here have absolutely no problems
since these new 3,000 chips are very
power efficient pulling less than that
of the 2000 series when they're getting
their sweet spot over clocks so when it
comes to Zen - I'm gonna pull up an old
analogy that I once heard a bit of a
joke but this time it's no joke and that
is when it comes to Zen to just buy it
it's phenomenal value for money
especially the 3,700 X I think that's
going to give everyone what they're
looking for word that included Ray's
spire cooler which does a great job on
the X 570 boards - I did some testing
here and it's really not coming that far
behind at all compared to a three sixty
millimeter radiator and you will be able
to clock this on those X 370 and be 350
motherboards and get some great
performance and especially value for
money and also save a bit of power on
the power bill compared to previous
generation
chips when it comes to the 3900 X if
you're looking for a Productivity King
that's definitely going to satisfy your
needs though there is the 16 core around
the corner so if you are waiting for an
upgrade and you want a seriously big
upgrade then I'm guessing the 39 50 X is
definitely going to be for you and with
that aside I hope you guys enjoyed
today's review if you did be sure to hit
that like button for us and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
where I've got a lot of different cool
tests coming up with Zen too so make
sure you stay subscribed ring the bell
if you want to see these videos the
moment they drop and also let us know in
the comment section below
what do you think about the new king in
town AMD with their Zen 2 architecture
I'm super excited as an enthusiast
that's been longing for some real
upgrades in the CPU department and
that's what AMD have delivered Thank You
AMD for giving enthusiasts what they
want it's a breath of fresh air and it's
good to see that the underdog is now
back on top it's the early millennia all
over again if you guys remember those
days but that aside I'll catch you in
the next one peace out for now bye
