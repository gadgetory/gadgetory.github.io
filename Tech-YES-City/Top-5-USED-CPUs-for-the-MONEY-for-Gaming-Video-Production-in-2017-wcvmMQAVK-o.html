CPUs hitting the market in 2017 that
have just shaken everything up people
are wondering what are the hot CPUs in
the use price performance segment well
don't worry
today I've got the top 5 picks that will
help you get that best price performance
in games and productivity if you're on a
budget welcome back guys until now
picking five really hot CPUs that are
going to start in the order of what I
think the least taught us to the most
hottest thing number one hour before we
get into that I will mention two
honorable mentions that are really close
to making the list and that is the qhq
ji7 5400 T engineering sample now this
thing was so close to making the list
but it does need a pretty expensive z170
motherboard and of course it won't work
on all three 170 motherboards and they
will need a specific file I'll have more
information up here if you guys want to
check that out also the next CPU that
didn't make the list but was very close
was the e 50 450 now this is a very old
CPU now dating back a good 10 years now
this motherboard is starting to see the
end of life even in the use price
performance segment however if you can
overclock it and you can get really good
ddr2 memory or if you're lucky to get a
motherboard that supports ddr3 memory
then this CPU can still be very kick ass
coming in number five is the Apple III
x6 10:55 t this is a six-course 6
threaded processor from AMD now the good
thing about this CPU is that the am-3
motherboard are pretty cheap having a
quick look
I saw one available with international
shipping for $55 really good deal
especially with the $55 CPU you can have
a pretty kick-ass CPU and motherboard on
a budget however keep in mind you will
want to overclock this CPU as it is
quite dated now in terms of IPC
Joey and number four is the ex 56:15 Z
on this is a really kick-ass CPU 6 cores
12 threads for $27 are you freaking
kidding me absolutely amazing price
performance for the CPU alone now the
reason this didn't get pushed up the
list is because the x58 motherboard are
still very rare and still very expensive
having a quick look I couldn't find one
cheaper than $100 u.s. however even
those cheap $100 ones are not the
motherboards to get they will have
problems over cording so you will want
generally a motherboard from a reputable
brand like a Zeus MSI asrock gigabyte
and you will want it to have six slots
of memory there generally the models to
go with on this platform and of course
they are generally expensive but the cpu
price performance alone man is my
favorite cpu of the bunch
however again the motherboard set this
thing back to the list at number four
coming in at number three is a very odd
CPU this is the e5 2680 3v3 now it's the
Haswell architecture and it's 14 cos 28
threads and it's on the Haswell IPC so
it's very fast very potent now you may
be wondering at face value it's only 2
gigahertz on all-cause correct however
there is a hacker or mod you can perform
to get it to turbo up to 3 point 1 Giga
on all cause now it's beef speeds and
this many calls and thread this thing is
an absolute beast
of course it is expensive coming in at
four hundred and seventy dollars but it
is a choice for someone looking for
something just with a heap of power
especially for gaming and productivity
or even more coming in at number two is
the i5 2500 K this is going 480 us now
the reason this made it pretty far up
the list is because not only does it
overclock extremely well the
motherboards are currently very cheap
out there at the moment doing a quick
scan of motherboards that are readily
available and it's very good prices now
the good thing about a CPU is it will
overclock on not only P 67 or Z 67
motherboards they will overclock on z77
multiples as well so if you manage to
find cheaper motherboards on that line
up then you can overclock this thing to
a good solid 4.6 gigahertz stable on
most cases I have heard of people
getting them up to 5 gigahertz with very
good cooling
but since you're on a budget you're
probably going to go with air-cooling
and in the case when I got one of these
in it overclocked on a $20 multiple 24.6
key goes on a mediocre air cooler now
coming in at number one is the ex 3460
you currently get these for around $40
and they're absolutely phenomenal value
for course eight threads and the good
thing about this platform is the
motherboards are readily available I did
a quick scan and I can find p55
motherboards for pretty cheap also H 55
motherboards for very cheap as well so
these CPUs will overclock on those
lowest tee and motherboards now hey
Treaty files and they will do it quite
well at least in my experience I have in
the past
godly CPUs up to 4 gigahertz on these
hey 25 motherboards so highly
recommended coming in at number one here
awesome value for money even in 2017
anyways I hope you enjoyed today's top 5
used price-performance CPUs for 2017 let
me know in the comments section below
what was your favorite pic or if you
have another pic that didn't make it
into the list because there are a lot of
good news price profanity to use out
there would love to hear your thoughts
and opinions as always and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
