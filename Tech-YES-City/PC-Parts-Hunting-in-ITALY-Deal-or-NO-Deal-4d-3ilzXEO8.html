an airplane docked into Italy this is
the lovely city of Maranello which I got
into a place called Bologna and then I
had to travel here and I was so tired
last night I just ate dinner crashed out
but now it's the next day and I am on
that grind we're gonna go used
price-performance PC hunting or deal
hunting and parts hunting in this little
town here but also in the place called
Bologna as well because that's a bigger
city but two things to know as soon as I
got in here and found out what the
matters were in Europe and that is using
apps like let go and also Spock
so Spock's really good I tried this app
out my friend in Austria recommended it
to me and I've already got a deal
organised for 85 euro for a GTX 960 now
I know that's not phenomenal value for
money but it's definitely pretty good
considering I've heard a lot of horror
stories about Europe and actually seeing
a lot of deals on this app I can
understand what people are saying I mean
there's guys selling Pentium 4 pcs for
50 euro they're trying to peddle this
absolute garbage out and rip people off
I don't think you can play any games in
2018 on a Pentium 4 little loans boot
the thing up
but there are some other good deals out
there I mean once you sift through all
the garbage there are some gems I've put
in a few offers already but we're gonna
see how that pans out over the next few
days hopefully we'll be able to pick
some of these deals up if not we could
probably organize postage but another
thing I am noticing as well there are
people who are trying to just sell like
keyboards that are really old and I mean
you can buy this stuff brand new off
Aliexpress for even cheaper delivered to
your door so when it comes to looking
for deals don't be sidetracked by some
of the garbage marketing out there but
there seems to be some use
price-performance hustlers as well in
Europe which is a lot of respect to
those guys I think what looks like the
shark Coon case with three fans at the
front seems to be what the Aussie
version of the rotini 'm is for people
whipping together gaming piece
and they need a case with LED bling so I
think there's some people here they're
already on their game but in terms of
let go I've put an offer as well on a
z77 motherboard I'm gonna keep you guys
updated throughout this whole trip and
see what we can make out of these PC
parts hunting deals in Europe
so we're out here in the middle of
Bologna now and before in Maranello but
we're getting those deals with their two
apps spock and also let go people have
replied and for some reason they're
staying very close to their offers I
guess that's the thing about Italy
people don't budge a whole lot but we
have confirmed one deal we've done a
handshake and this is for a whole PC
with the GTX 1060 rising 2200 G
motherboard Ram power supply everything
so we've got this for four hundred euro
which is an absolute bargain even
compared to the deals that are getting
Australia just one thing is though we've
got to kind of secure a ride get a car
and go meet this guy because I don't
speak Italian he doesn't speak English
but it doesn't matter there's one
language that people always speak and
that's cash so we're gonna try and pick
this deal up tonight if we land this
this will just be a monster of a deal
but also at the same time we're gonna
keep on the grind keep hunting for some
good deals so stay tuned
good morning yes men and women and
essentially back home from going from
Bologna back to the hotel here the guy
yesterday afternoon about 4 p.m. he
cancelled the deal and said this
bullcrap excuse that he sold it on eBay
and I think honestly what really
happened was I mean I was speaking
English he only spoke Italian so it was
just too busy there was a barrier there
for the language and then I got my
friend to send him in a message in
Italian after that and I think he just
got spooked out because he actually gave
me his address
and I was looking to line up a car with
someone else who had rented a car here
at the hotel and it just fell through
the deal fell through but it would have
been an amazing deal because I could
have gutted all the parts out of it and
just left the case behind but it just
wasn't meant to be I mean it's fair
enough like when I put myself in someone
else's shoes if someone came to
Australia that didn't speak English at
all and now we're looking to get a PC
off me off Gumtree I'd be like what's
going on here like No so I mean it's my
own fault that I can't speak the lingo
here but I do kind of consider that if I
did speak the right lingo I think I
could have got that deal because in
Australia you know if someone's speaking
English and I can see that they're a
little bit concerned since this guy had
no feedback you can see they're a little
bit concerned I can then sort of like do
soft talk you know like hey man like you
know come to pick this up be really
polite but I don't know any Italian at
all all's I know is like it Daddy Arnall
and good Arceus and that's about it
and so this one fell through but I've
got to go film this event today and
after that I'm gonna still be on the
grind still be on the hunt here trying
to get those deals but until then we're
gonna see what pops up because
ultimately I'm not gonna take a bad deal
regardless of wherever in the world I am
I'm not gonna be taking a bad deal just
because I want to get something in the
suitcase for me it's like Deal or No
Deal and so everything else so far has
kind of been like No Deal except one
thing have been talking to a guys about
20 minutes down the road and he's
selling the Dell laptop this is an i7
855 you and Spiro on these things go in
Australia for about 1500 a you
is I'm trying to bargain him down to 550
euro which would be like maybe 800 and
something so I can pick this up get deal
on that I could flip it and make some
money but we'll see how we go there's
still a couple of days left in Italy
so it's now my last day in Italy and we
are filming right now at the Ferrari
racetrack now something that's important
about this Ferrari is that it is
sponsored by AMD so we're gonna take
this thing for a drive I'm probably
gonna do a separate video on this
because it's just so amazing out here
that is definitely a good sound right
there so basically update on the parts
hunt is that that deal fell through and
I couldn't find really anything else I
did find some other deals that sort of
like in the works the laptop that's
getting delayed till August and
unfortunate I won't be in Europe after
August so there is always a fallback
when you use parts hunting you always
take a look at every single item you
just scour the market and I managed to
find an i5 2400 I actually put down a
few bids on them so hopefully I win more
than one and at this price they are
really cheap CPU especially if you can
piece out a motherboard off Aliexpress
which is exactly what you're doing this
situation now for graphics cards I am
looking on the prowl looking at what I
can get it seems to be a few rx4 70s and
IR x5 70s and stuff like that coming off
mining benches so hopefully I can pick
one of them up but this will conclude
the used parts hunt anyway hope you guys
have enjoyed this first little tool with
Italy I didn't really check out any
shops because I heard they're just a
complete ripoff
so basically when it comes to getting
those deals these two apps are really
good I highly recommend them if you're
in Europe or in the UK but on that note
as well you've got to always be quick
when it comes to getting a deal now my
ego is a little bit bruised because that
first deal which was amazing fell
through but I just think that's to do
with the fact that I don't have a
home-field advantage I don't speak
Italian the guy clearly got freaked out
so yeah none the wiser but anyway guys
we're gonna go over to Austria tonight
I'm gonna get some rest tonight but then
we're gonna do a full fledge pots on
there because I won't have to do any
other filming for any other events or
anything like that so this trip for
Italy has only been three days it's been
super busy but I've been trying to get
you guys the content that you love and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon looking forward to your
comments as well stay tuned for all the
juice videos coming up peace out for now
bye the laptop that's getting delayed
till August and unfortunately won't be
in Europe after all I mean before oh but
right now I'm gonna go drive myself a
Ferrari and have a lot of fun kick back
and enjoy Italy because it is so
beautiful here
I mean last night I went to this dinner
and it was just incredible this Italy is
such a beautiful country and I really
understand now why Italians just talk
about Italy all the time because really
nice place absolutely love it anyway
guys I'm gonna go drive myself a Ferrari
now I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon pays out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
