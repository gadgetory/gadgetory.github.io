use the new parts PC that can play
battlefield 1 on ultra settings at 1440p
for $360
welcome back to tech city I've been
hearing your calls for PC builds now I
thought I'd do something very unique
with this review sample do carci that I
got sent so instead of doing the typical
whole you know go over the cases
features and stuff I just decided to do
a build with it and then at the end of
the video I'll talk about what I didn't
like and liked about this case and
whether I can recommend it for 50
dollars until then let's get on with the
battlefield 1 PC the parts and how much
they cost the build and then the
benchmarks
so that we have at the LGA 771 Xeon
clock to around 4 gigahertz was handling
that 1060 OK at 1440p at 1080p it was
starting to free up a lot of room for
the GPU and the CPU was still maxed out
though I will be making another video
comparing this CPU with the GTX 1060 to
the 6800 K to see how much of a
difference there really is so stay tuned
for that video though in the meantime
this build was just phenomenal price
performance and you can still see that
those LGA 775 Simpson one combo from
like 8 years ago is still kicking hard
to this very date the thing that made
this build was that memory I managed to
get a server or actually a couple of
sips I actually got four servers two of
them I gave to my friends because
they've been helping me out a lot but
the two that I got I managed to pull out
like 16 gigabytes of ddr2 memory from
both those service for nothing they were
going to go on the tip and I said hey
let me take a look at them first managed
to get that memory out there that's what
made this build really cheap as I got
the memory for free which was awesome
and with this platform the memory really
is the key to getting those high
overclocks
out of that 771 CPU and then after that
you start to hit that boundary where you
need really good cooling as you can see
with my zeal and it started to even
throttle over 4 gigahertz before even
the cooler was making good contact it
just couldn't handle the heat after 4
gigahertz which is kind of impressive
considering the performance that it's
already getting for an eight-year-old
CPU so with that aside let's talk about
the Dakar see a case that was sent over
from deep cool for review so instead of
doing a typical review where I just go
over the components and the features of
the case I'm going to actually do it
after I've done and building it and
things that I like about this case was
simply the build quality it was
phenomenal build quality especially for
a $50 case or 79 AUD depending on where
you live at the bottom of the case
you've got the sealed off power supply
enclosure there which enables you to
mount non modular power supplies which
if you're on a budget you're probably
going to go with that option anyway
though you've got the option that amount
only one 120 or 140 mm fan of the front
I would have liked to have sent two
options there for fans though one option
still at this budget is decent you also
got the side window panel which is
really nice to see all your components
shine through once you've finished the
build and the back of the case also has
that option for cable management for
drive options you can mount to five
point two five inch drives up the top or
13.5 inch drive
down the bottom of that 5.25 inch tree
you got the option for two SSDs in the
middle there another back another two
3.5 inch mechanical drives as well then
towards the top you can detach that and
then mount a 240 mm rad if you want to
at the bottom that goes you got four
feet and a dust filter option there
which is kind of hard to remove in
practice so ultimately the CAHSEE is a
one hard-hitting case for 50 bucks I was
really blown away by the build quality
that you're getting for the money so I
had to critique one thing would be those
triangles inside the case which kind of
reminded me of something like the
Zelda's Triforce I mean that's a cool
thing if you're a massive Zelda fan you
want to do a Zelda thing build there for
the masses I'm sure people would have
liked to have seen may be simple squares
or even just air vents like they did on
their other cases you guys that's about
it for me today if you liked this video
then be sure to hit that like button and
also I hope this video showcased the
power of eight-year-old hardware it can
still get up and boogie even with the
latest and greatest gtx 1060 even though
admittedly that 1060 still had a bit of
headroom it was a very enjoyable
experience on this pc but i will detail
that more in an upcoming video so stay
tuned for that
and also let me know in the comment
section below did you like this unique
case review I certainly had a lot of fun
doing it and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
bye
and then also I hope this video
showcased the power of that old-school
hardware I mean eight years old and look
how hard it's still going for hardware
that's a lot of hearts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
