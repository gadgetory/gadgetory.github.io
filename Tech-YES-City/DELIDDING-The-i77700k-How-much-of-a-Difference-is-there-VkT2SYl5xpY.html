going to roll with it see boy interest
yeah boy what I did my review of the I
770 700 km both the I 570 600 K I
noticed that the temperatures were
ridiculously high and so today I'm going
to be deleting at 7700 K can be looking
at the temperatures and seeing how much
of a difference is made what about
detection is bran come to you guys
they've like a garden a little bit of a
free discussion about the i-77 700 K
then I recently deleted now if you guys
want to do this I recommend getting a
specialized tool now the differences
between this generation and skylight as
well versus has well and also the
previous generation before that ivy
bridge which is like your i7 3770k and
your i7 4770k is that they had a thick
of PCB so you could essentially clamp
them in a vise and then use a hammer and
bang off the lid and then you could put
on some useful paste the problem however
this generation with skylake and both
Cabul ache is that the PCB is really
thin on these retail chips and so sin in
fact that I don't recommend using the
vise method either with a hammer or
using the vise itself to diagonally
unclamp the chip from the heatsink this
time around however there are some
sellers on eBay for example selling
these kits that I got here for about 18
Australian dollars which would probably
be around 14 USD so it's actually pretty
damn cheap that was included with
postage - for that price and so if you
get one of these kits you can
essentially apply all the pressure
evenly across the kit this kit here
looks like it was 3d printed and there
is a guy in Europe doing these kits I
think his name is divorce sorry if I
butchered that pronunciation but there
is a guy over in Europe selling these
kits for around about 30 euro I don't
know how much extra postage is but
apparently they've got a wait time on
them so I decided not to wait and get
this one off eBay so it off you get
stuff one of these kits you can then
bang off the lid from the PCB in this
case I had to use this in conjunction
with the rubber mallet so after you do
that you will then have to apply some
specialized thermal paste I don't
recommend all your normal stuff like
your artic Silva or your MX 4
for example as they will just dry up
from the intense heat emitted from the
dye I use ku laboratories liquid Pro
this stuff is legit I've used it in the
past though there are a few others out
there that people do recommend I just
stick the liquid probe as I know it does
a really good job
so after you've spread it out the
thermal paste on the guy you can then
connect the integrated heat spreader on
there and then clamp it down using your
motherboards pressure so now to the
juicy part of the video the results
we're talking like at least a 20 degree
drop here and not only that higher
overclocks when I did my i7 7700 cave
review I could only get this thing to
four point nine gigahertz though after I
deleted it I could now get it to 5.1
gigas and I could even boot into Windows
and get to the OS screen before it
crashed at five point two gears now keep
in mind I would give it more voltage but
it is really hot at the moment this is a
33 or 32 degrees at the moment so the
temperatures are ridiculously hot in
here and I still managed to pull off a
five point one key good overclock and
looking at the temperatures this is
probably the most important part when
you do lid when I was benchmarking at
4.9 gigahertz before I deleted this
thing was going near a hundred degrees
it was going well over 90 degrees
completely not recommended to anyone out
there for 24/7 operations though after I
deleted this thing was sitting around 80
degrees at 5.1 gigahertz so the
difference is huge not only for the
temperatures but also the 24/7 stable
operation and also if you guys want to
get a higher overclock out of your cab
you like CPUs now one thing I will
discuss with this is that it's really
crazy because you would think with as
the generations of CPUs go on until we
push that a thermal paste on these CPUs
but I don't think they are I mean with
the house will refresh they kind of did
get it right with the thermal paste on
those chips where the temperatures were
a lot lower than the previous two
generations before that but it seems
like with can be lake they've done it
again
where they just put cheap thermal paste
on and this stuff is really cheap when I
delivered the CPU this stuff was like
raw box so anyway guys to sum things up
quickly if you are getting a cab you
lake CPU and you do want to overclock
then I can highly recommend deleting
this thing and getting not only higher
o'clock that much better temperatures so
I'll put some links in the description
below if you want to get some of the
gear there keep in mind some of these D
lid kits they will be tough to get but
I'm sure they'll become more popular as
more people want to deal with their
cabbie leg CPUs and you guys let me know
in the comments section what you think
about Cammy Lake I honestly think it's
pretty piss week that they have done
this again with this generation of CPUs
love to hear your thoughts and opinions
as always in the comments section and
I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon also the benchmark PC is
done the way I'm having some problems
with this - ATX it's like kind of like
green screening on me when I'm getting
to Windows so I'm going to fix that
problem but then the benchmark PC is on
its way it is coming to you guys anyway
that's enough of me rambling I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
