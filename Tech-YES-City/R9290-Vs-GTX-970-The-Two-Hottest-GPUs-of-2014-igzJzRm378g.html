we're just going to get straight in to
the benchmarks and I'm gonna talk about
two of the most hottest cards in my
opinion
well actually the two hottest cards of
2014 and that is the r9 290 and the GTX
970 so I've both got the gigabyte
windforce Editions here so this will
pretty much be a apples to apples
comparison we're gonna be comparing
these two graphics cards to find out
which is better for gaming however I
will factor in price as well and since
the gigabyte r9 290 was an overclocked I
decided to overclock it to the factory
overclocked settings from gigabyte
themselves so what you'll be seeing here
is pretty much a factory overclocked
card versus a factory overclocked card
and let's get on with it so the first
game up now is watchdogs this is 1440p
ultra I just decided to run a part of
the open world where cars and everything
was running it was a controlled
benchmark single-player no variants at
all practically very little and we see
here that the GTX 970 did beat the r9
290 at 1440p ultra but I would consider
this a significant margin I mean we're
gonna hear 40 2.48 average FPS versus 53
average fps
moving on now to shadows of Mordor this
is at 1440p ultra I just decided for
this test to use the in-house
benchmarking utility so again these
benchmarks are going to be all different
kinds of benchmarks I'm gonna put in
some controlled benchmarks put in some
multiplayer benchmarks for you guys so
you're getting a bit of everything to
see how this is a these graphics cards
perform in the real world so we go here
the GTX 970 scored sixty eight point one
nine average FPS versus the UH nine to
ninety scoring fifty nine point zero
eight fps however it was important to
note here that the GTX 970 did pull over
twice the minimum frames of the r9 290
which I considered to be quite important
since the frame rates are sort of
hanging around 60fps here so for the
smoothest gameplay experience in shadows
of mortal I'd probably recommend going
with the uh nine to ninety if you're on
PC sorry I mean the GTX 970 one what am
I going here I'm going crazy anyway
let's move on now to advanced warfare
1440p ultra
we've got here the gtx970 scoring 112
point 4 frames per second versus the r9
290 scoring 95 point 0 8 frames per
second so there's a little bit of an
advantage here to the GTX 970 they both
played advanced warfare absolutely fine
though if you were one of those persons
or people who are serious about getting
maybe 144 Hertz monitor then you might
want to go with the GTX 980 even get
even a more of a beast of a graphics
card in there but let's move on now to
warlords of draenor the latest expansion
from World of Warcraft now I actually
forgot to increase the max FPS so there
was actually an FPS limiter in this game
but once I finished I did I actually
decided that both these graphics cards
ran World of Warcraft absolutely fine it
was as smooth as butter on both the GTX
970 and the r9 290 so there wasn't much
of a difference here both of these cards
ran this game absolutely fine I think
you could probably run World of Warcraft
on a potato for what it's worth anyway
let's move on now to battlefield 4 this
is the test range of 1440p ultra this is
another single-player control benchmark
we've got here the GTX 970 out of the
box scoring a hundred and 10.08 average
FPS versus the r9 290 scoring eighty two
point five six so actually not out of
the box the r9 290 is overclocked to the
overclocked out of the box settings
anyway let's move on now to Crysis 3
1440p ultra we've got here thirty five
point nine to average FPS from the GTX
970 versus our night the r9 290 with
thirty one point five four so not a lot
in that one except the minimum frame
rates are to be noted there the GTX 970
didn't have a significant advantage in
the minimum frame rates with the Dena
nine to nine dropping down to 17 and the
GTX 970 dropping down to 29 so that
about wraps it up for the benchmarks i
will give you guys a quick look at power
consumption the r9 290 uses up on
average about 90 watts more than the GTX
970 so you will I mean you will want to
have a better power supply or a power
supply with higher wattage if you are
indeed
going to run the r9 290 over the GTX 970
it's not a huge amount but it is worth
noting
so the GTX 970 does use less power and
in turn this since it does use less
power it does mean that the temps will
be lower on the card it's all I think
it's a lot easier to cool a GTX 970 then
a 992 Knight is shown here in the max
temps this was done with the ambient
degrees at around about 15 degrees
Celsius so this was with the overclocked
settings - I just max overclocked both
cards and they both ran actually pretty
cool this was measured with afterburners
temperature sensor graph things so the
max was 60 degrees on the GTX 970 and
the max was 74 degrees on the r9 290
so in conclusion it doesn't matter which
way you go if you go with an r9 290 or
if you go with the GTX 970 they're both
going to do a really good job of playing
triple-a titles of 1440p at 1080p that's
out of the question both these graphics
cards will destroy games at 1080p so I
didn't even include the benchmarks in
there because they're not worth
including if you want to step it up to
4k then you may wish to think about
getting two of these graphs cards in
here so like a crossfire though me I'm a
single GPU man myself
I love single GPUs dude which is giving
the best experience in my opinion in
most games but that's up to you guys
whatever floats your boat however I will
say that if you can get the r9 290 at
$250 and you're just gaming it is a
great buy for that price also similarily
the GTX 970 is also a fantastic buy for
the money if you can pick it off at $330
now we all know that $330 price tag is
kind of a little bit in the air at the
moment because there's just so much
demand for the GTX 970 so the prices
have gone up and I mean it's obvious to
see why if you looked at the benchmark
you can see why the GTX 970 is a beast
and it does all this while running cool
and using less power then also its
previous architecture and also the AMD
architecture so the GTX 970 is pretty
much a really hot card at the moment but
I mean if you can pick up the r9 290 and
you're on a real budget
this card will also do a great job of
playing games at 1440p besides the FPS I
have done a full review of the r9 290 if
you guys wish to wash it watch it not
wash it and if you wish to wash it then
whatever come to my house and wash the
graphics card for me in destroy but if
you wish to watch the video I'll put a
link in the description below where you
can check out the r9 290 full review
where I talk about also I address the
issue of AMD micro stuttering I also
talk about some things that I noticed
when I was playing games with the uh 9
to 90 but for what it's worth if you're
a triple a title guy both these graphics
cards are gonna be absolute heaven for
gaming at 1440p anyway if you guys
enjoyed this review please give it a
thumbs up if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment in the
comment section below and I will get
back to you as soon as I can have also
got a CUDA vs. OpenCL vs. CPU only
productivity benchmarks to come so stay
tuned for that and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
