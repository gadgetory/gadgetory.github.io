beside me I have a cooler mounted on it
and it's not just any cooler
it cost me three dollars and it's brand
new I think this is the cheapest new
cooler I've ever bought in my life also
comes with a blue LED fan and promises
to cool a nice seven but actually
Kenneth let's find out
so here this cooler is right here on the
desk it's a zero it's made in China it's
got a heap of Chinese characters on
there which I can't read says it's super
silent and it actually comes with the
12-centimeter fan and it promises 48 CFM
which I'm kind of a little bit skeptical
of those numbers but on the side here
it's got compatibility comes with a very
simple kit that will mount very easily
to indeed the LGA 1156 t6 and also 2011
though I would caution mounting it to
both 1366 and 2011 because they have
higher TDP CPUs that I honestly think
will overload this cooler wayne this
cooler up it weighs in at a monstrous
167 grams which actually for three
dollars isn't too bad at all that's
without the mounting kit but here's the
mounting kit right here it's actually
the same one that antec used on their a
32 well that said we've got this thing
mounted on an i7 3770 we've even used
the included thermal paste in the box so
let's give it a whirl
so I am shocked this thing is actually
not throttling so at first I was looking
at the graph and I'll seeing it and it
was going up and up and up and I was
like no way this is not gonna make it
but then it's sort of plateaued out at
around 90 degrees now it is not optimal
to keep your CPU at around these
temperatures especially 24/7 but at the
same time it's not going to be too bad
so does getting to 94 degrees but it is
running at pretty low voltage one point
one volts not draining up a lot of heat
and so if you guys are experienced with
laptop CPUs they actually do run a lot
of the times constantly at 90 to 95
degrees somewhere around there so it's
kind of I guess you're getting laptop
style performance on your desktop PC and
another thing to remember is that this
is a stress test and it is loading up
the CPU like a hundred percent complete
so usually games won't stress CPUs like
this and not nearly as much so you could
see maybe around 80 degrees in games but
we will be testing that and also I'm
gonna let it run until about thirty
minutes just to see if it does throw
so here we are now we're running the
noise tests and this thing shocked me
it's running as low as 28 decibels so
they do say it's super silent on the box
and it is literally whisper quiet I
cannot hear it at all
I actually had to stop my graphics card
here to fan on that to get a proper
reading because before that this thing
was running at about 43 decibel
mind-blowing so far so here we are now
after 30 minutes of testing and I'm
completely blown away so we haven't
thermal throttled at all max we've hit
is 95 degrees and admittedly it is a
little bit of a cooler day it's not
summer so in summer this thing might
actually strata so it is 22 degrees but
like we're talking about before games
don't stress the CPU generally anywhere
near like out of 64 so what we're gonna
do now is load up games especially pub G
comes to mind very popular title pretty
CPU intense but of course we do need a
more powerful graphics card
so we just finished playing pop G and
the results are surprisingly good this
managed to keep the CPU in around the 60
to 70 degree range and pop G does
utilize quite a bit of CPU the RX 580
that we're using here was sitting at
100% as well so that's really good news
for this little cooler right here
however all is not perfect with the
$3.00 cooler there's a normal one there
that is what you'd expect it works
absolutely fine and then we go over to
this one here and we try to spin it we
see the fan blade is not only slowing
down quickly it's also making this
really obnoxious noise so if you do come
into this cooler and you do get that
noise there's an easy way to fix it and
that is just what I call the tech
yes-man grille that is grab it then just
give it a little bit of a sort of like a
flex always it's really sort of
crunching it up there perfect and so
we've got dota 2 loaded up here we can
see the FPS on the 3770 is actually
really damn high
GPUs loaded 100% so we've actually
turned the settings down from 1440p high
to medium to try and stress the CPU a
little bit more so we'll give this a
good 20 minutes of gameplay and then
come back and see how the CV is holding
up
so just finish playing up dota 2 then
and play the full match on the ez bot
mode of course it's so easy to get kills
on this mode but nonetheless we stress
test the CPU because I turn the settings
down as we said before and that enabled
the CPU to get up to about 82 degrees so
I'm actually really comfortable
considering that is a worst-case
scenario for it in games because it's
then stressing the CPU a little bit more
than the usual gamer would be used to
but regardless it's still impressive so
let's move on now to a conclusion so now
we've got the verdict on the $3 cooler
and I mean I think the three dollars in
itself justifies how impressed I am with
this little thing right here now I did
get a heap of them and one of them did
have a problem with a noisy fan rattling
fan and easily fix that by doing the man
grip as we saw before but besides that I
mean the quality control I'm sure is not
as good as more expensive companies but
this is a cooler that's coming in
usually at a fifth of the price of
anything in its league and I had sad
thing is I couldn't find this up on
Aliexpress anymore so it's three dollars
for the cooler one dollar for shipping
and it it made it's really lightweight
comes in at 160 grams and the closest
thing I can now find on it is about four
dollars and it's got a different fan it
looks like it's the same heatsink so
this looks like it's a standardized
heatsink design from some factory but
the fan they've put on the one on
Aliexpress that's available now is a
little bit smaller so I'm not sure if
that will handle the i7 but also the
other benefit of it was that it was
indeed really silent like it said on the
Box 28 decibels some of the quietest
fans I've ever heard in my life so not a
bad job I mean some of these experiments
thank you guys for recommending them to
me I'm definitely gonna keep looking out
for things like this I'm glad I did grab
a couple of them because they're really
going to help if I've got a standardized
build especially with an i-5 in it and I
need to sell it and I need a cooler and
it's got a blue LED fan too to go on top
this surprise I mean I pay you in
Australia
like three dollars for a piece of sushi
I should just maybe start eating this
instead though with all that aside I
hope you enjoyed today's video if you
did then be sure to hit that like button
let me know in the comment section below
have you ever tried something like this
if so what was your experience like if
not will you give it a shot
loved reading thoughts and opinions as
always don't catch one in all the tech
video very soon peace out for now but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
