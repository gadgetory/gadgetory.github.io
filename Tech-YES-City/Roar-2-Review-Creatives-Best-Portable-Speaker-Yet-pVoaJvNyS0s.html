welcome back to tech yeah City this is
brian coming to you guys today with a
review i've created raw to portable
speaker device now wasting no time with
this unit it comes in at 1007 grams you
also get two different flavors of colors
there if you wish you've got the black
unit or the white unit and also this
thing stands at 108 millimeters by 186
millimeters wide with 52 millimeters of
depth there now the rated battery charge
time of this unit is 6 to 8 hours also I
got around about six hours usage out of
this device however the volume was
usually set to max however if I had the
volume set probably to around 50 or
lower I'd imagine that I'd get around 8
hours usage out of this device looking
at the construction of the device it
features five speakers two on the side
there which are dedicated to bass and
have the creative logo featured on that
and also in the middle you get three
speakers there which are dedicated to
mids and treble you've also got above
that the power button the volume buttons
and the Bluetooth phone connection
device there which in practice all these
buttons felt really sturdy however I
would like to see a volume LED indicator
read out there to let you know that the
status of the device and also the
current volume level and which device is
actually connected at the time then
besides that you have the microphone
holes there and also the battery
indicator LED and the near-field
communication device which if you just
touch your smartphone you are now paired
with the device speaking of the
microphone it is good up until about a
meter past then the voice quality does
start to diminish quite a lot however I
can recommend it for quick calls and
using in your car if that's what you
wish to do with this device moving to
the top of the device we have there the
USB audio a mass storage switch there
which if you're plugged into the
computer can use it as either or below
that you have the raw to and tera based
options pressing this once will
introduce tera base which will give your
sound more base and then pressing it
again will give it the raw to mode which
essentially makes the music sound a
little bit more crystallized if you're
used to using creatives products I
personally prefer the flat level as it
sounded really good when I was listening
to some of my favorite genres I'll give
you guys a quick sound test of what the
three modes sound like
oh yeah I'm something donate usage in
Crimean background and back down and
stuff doing my specify just a smart
you know blame the break again ashore
weeds off the shame mains and I'm around
besides that we have a play/pause button
back and forth track selection and a
shuffle or normal continuance of music
there underneath that is the recording
options there so you can use this device
as a dedicated recorder you've also got
the option to play pause the recording
and also mute the microphone on the fly
now lastly onto this device we're
looking at the input outputs here we
have a micro SD a micro USB a USB out
which can actually be used to charge the
device so I use this to charge my smart
phone very nice touch then besides that
we have the auxiliary in and then the AC
in there if you wish to charge this unit
from the wall so now I'm going to give
you guys my thoughts and opinions about
the creative role - and I must say that
I was very impressed with this unit as
soon as I got it in build quality was
phenomenal also the sound coming out of
it was very good for a portable and I'm
a bit of a mild bass head so the bass
coming out of the scene was very decent
and it did please my taste I must say
that I did prefer it over the astro
speaker that I got in a few months
before this also another thing on
battery life I would like to see a
little bit more battery life however it
is understandable that the battery life
is less than the competitors because it
just has so much utility built into this
unit I was actually surprised which what
you can do with this thing
one of the most impressive features was
that it could charge my smart phone on
the fly another thing that I really
liked about this unit is you can
actually use it as an audio device for
your smartphone on the fly use it with a
Playstation 4 use it with your PC so if
you need those manual speakers you can
also do that with this unit then lastly
comes the build quality and creative has
also included some extra feet there so
you can mount it on a vertical way like
this and not have to worry about it
slipping
however the feet on the bottom here are
very good
in practice I'll surprise with how much
that or how well they could grip things
and not slide anywhere also on that note
it is a pretty heavy unit so be careful
I wouldn't recommend dropping this thing
I'm not too keen to drop it either to
test on how well it would hold up from a
drop test so on all I will be giving
this unit four and a half stars out of
five I was extremely impressed by what
creative are done with this unit and
especially at the price point I think
you can get this thing at around about
140 USD at the time of doing this review
which makes this thing really good value
for money if you're looking for a really
good portable that has a lot more
functionality built into it some little
things that I will critique is the
battery life and also the fact that it
does have no LED indicator readout there
though they are two minor things that
will not stop you from enjoying this
product and I can highly recommend it I
think creative have done a really good
job with the raw tooth anyway that's
about it for me today guys if you have
any questions or comments be sure to
drop a comment in the comment section
below and I'll get back to you as soon
as I can if you like this video then you
know what to do hit that thumbs up on
and if you haven't already subscribed to
tackier city for more tech news and

see you in the</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
