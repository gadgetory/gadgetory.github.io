and on top of that they've also released
a brand new architecture of graphics
cards on seven nanometer this is the
Navi architecture of cards with two SKUs
in the product lineup that being the RX
5700 and also the rx 5700 XT today here
on the desk we've got the 5700 which is
coming in at 349 u.s. dollars in
Australia it's priced in at 549 AUD and
we'll talk about the price performance a
little bit later in the conclusion but
with this release quite a few things
have happened first of all I'm sorry
that I'm late to do this review for you
guys my super samples here actually came
in super late
so that held up things in terms of
reviewing also had some personal stuff
that I had to sort out behind the scenes
and on top of that there was all this
driver controversy with pre-release
drivers for both sides being a little
bit buggy so I decided to hold off and
here we are now testing the post retail
release driver so this means I can give
you guys the retail experience if you
were to buy one of these cards put it in
your computer today and see how it
performs against these two super cards
now although the r-tx 2060s in 27 years
will be in today's benchmarks I'm gonna
be focusing this review as per the title
on this card in particular here the 5700
so without further ado let's roll those
benchmarks for you both 1080p and 1440p
numbers and then get back to the desk
and see what has unfolded here
so the gaming benchmarks in a nutshell
at 1080p and 1440p showed that this card
right here the 5700 is actually pretty
good value for money if you're comparing
it to especially the RT x 2060 at the
same price point and even trades blows
sometimes with the RT X 2060 super which
comes in $50 more expensive now one
thing that the gaming benchmarks will
quickly go through the titles one by one
here we can see with Apex legends this
was a shining star for the new navi
graphics cards where this was literally
coming close to at 1080p the r-tx 2080
and so I had to read test this a few
times because I couldn't believe what my
eyes was seeing stepping up to 1440p did
lose a little bit of performance but it
was great to see that 3 under $50 card
was competing very hard in this
particular title now you've also got
anti lag which is another feature that I
took a look at when I was over in the
USA if you haven't seen that video I'll
put the link up here where basically it
can help shave off a few milliseconds
and make you even more competitive which
in a game like Apex Legends I'm guessing
you will want to have now next out up
here we had dirt rally too and we can
see that 5,700 is beating the 2060 at
1080p and then tying at 1440p which was
an interesting trend especially when we
look at apex Legends where the
performance was kind of not scaling as
well and went from 1080p to 1440p with
the 5700 though Crysis 3 was the only
game where the 2060 beat the 5700 the
movie wrote of Tom Clancy's the division
2 this was one of the three titles that
we tested here today where I've seen a
few things change in these games and
that is the Nvidia cards are now running
better on DX 12 and we'll see this with
shadows of the Tomb Raider and also
another title strange Brigade with
something different altogether is
happening with that game but at DX 12
1080p in 1440p the 5700 is slotting
right in between the 2060 super in the
2060 again showing pretty good value for
money when compared to the 2060 directly
and then movie elder shadows of the term
raider it actually tied with the 2060
super at 1080p which was really good to
see and then 1440p is slightly lost
which does take a little look at the
scaling of these cards and we see that
this card is performing its best at
1080p gaming and then we
a strange brigade I saw something
interesting with this title where the
game ran better on both AMD and NVIDIA
on the Vulcan Engine where as opposed to
the DX 12 we're getting slightly less
FPS on the AMD side but on the nvidia
side we're actually getting
significantly less FPS so testing these
out both on Vulcan show that 20 60 super
did come quite a bit ahead of the 5700
but then they 5700 still managed to edge
out that of the 20 60 standard edition
but looking at the power consumption
figures I decided to test at Apex
legends at 1080p and we can see here
that basically it's gonna vary from game
to game especially since this title did
show the most FPS for the 5700 so it's
utilizing that GPU in a perfect sense
and so I guess this game would use off a
little bit more power on the new Navi
cards and other games but we see here
it's pretty much slotting right near a
2060 in terms of power consumption
that's overall where I'd put it
especially since I did test a few
settings in dirt rally to for example
the power consumption was about 20 watts
less and we'll talk about the
overclocking of this car because it
relates directly to dirt rally to where
we can see that the auto OC and the
software does work pretty well but when
we manually overclocked it we only got
one extra fps and it became very
unstable and we also were using up an
extra roughly 25 Watts over the auto OC
and the fan speeds of course I set them
to 100% so I want to get the most out of
this GPU possible and the thing is the
software I don't think is ready for
overclocking quite yet and there's a few
things that aren't ready for this
graphics card for instance the Radeon
image sharpening it does look pretty
good and I'll show you guys a comparison
here you can pull it up in 4k on YouTube
because I did capture it on my 4k
capture card
where we got 1080p and then we've got
1080p Radeon image sharpening and then
we've got 1440p on the monitor and we
can see that the image sharpening does
give out a different look I wouldn't
call it necessarily better than the
1080p image but it does give out more
clarity and you really didn't lose any
FPS at all when I test this in stranger
Gaede I only lost one FPS 1080p versus
1080p but here's the problem with radio
and image sharpening when I had this
strange Brigade the whole system just
shut off on the lost benchmark I did
wear the fan speeds were then getting
locked out and so there's a still a
software bug and that's a dangerous
thing to happen especially on a retail
driver where if you're turning on radio
and image sharpening and your whole card
is just pretty much safety switching off
you have the risk to damage the hardware
which is not a good thing for AMD nor is
it a good thing for the consumer that
then has to waste time and I are made
the cards so that was the second of the
software problems on top of the
overclocking when I manually Oh seated
as well as locking in the auto Oh see if
I alt tabbed out of a game for example
things would just lock up the whole
system so there are a few bugs that are
out there and I do warn you guys that it
is an initial release of a whole new
architecture for AMD so I think in a
couple of months this thing will be
working absolutely fine but if you want
to buy this graphics card right now then
I would recommend not sort of tweaking
around with the settings or overclocking
at this point in time especially if
you're not familiar with overclocking
they speaking of the overclocks
themselves the power consumption and the
fan noises what we could see here is
that the otto OC was doing a good job
but we still got eight decibels higher
of noise because the fan speeds were
ramping up higher and that did keep the
temperatures a little bit lower than the
default settings honestly it did start
to get a little bit annoying and a
hundred percent fan speeds was just
simply unbearable on this card so if you
really wanted to overclock at this point
in time I would recommend just locking
in the auto OC until the software
compatibility is improved also the last
thing with Radeon image sharpening what
I did turn this on it disabled the audio
coming out of the DisplayPort so that
was a little bit surprising - now the
final thing to talk about with these
cards is the encoder onboard that is the
VCE encoder and for this I decided to
take a look at a pass boxes video if you
guys haven't seen that I put a link up
here where he did an in-depth comparison
between the latest in video codec versus
this codec here even versus the rx 580
codec and then versus the software
implementation and he found with a
grading system known as V math that the
rx 580 was very similar so if you are
serious about streaming then you may
wish to check out that video where the
Nvidia Co
was coming out on top and before we move
over to a conclusion we'll quickly go
over the card in terms of its physical
attributes and that is at the back it's
got three display outs one HDMI 2.0 out
as well as a simple clean gunmetal gray
aesthetic and requiring an 8 plus 6 pin
on the back of the cut it weighs in just
over one kilogram and you don't get a
backplate included and now here we are
with the 5,700 and recommendation time
the conclusion on this is at 349 USD
it's bringing competition to the market
if you look at the raw gaming benchmark
numbers it's showing that the power
consumption is good as well as the FPS
is good overall beating out that of an
RT X 2060 at the same price and the plus
side of this is we looked at apex
legends if that's any indication of how
much extra AMD can get out of na'vi
then that will spell good times for the
next couple of years in terms of
bettering the architecture optimizing
the drivers for new games and extracting
the absolute most out of this card but
as it stands as of this day this is a
retail release driver and there are some
bugs worth mentioning the overclocking
is a little bit broken at the moment and
also things like turning on Radeon image
sharpening had my whole system shut off
so if you were to buy this card right
now I'd seriously recommend only just
getting it putting it in your system and
not tweaking any of the software
anything just playing your games for now
and then waiting maybe a month once all
the bugs are ironed out can have a
little bit of augmented fun with your
5700 and no I don't mean sexually
but ultimately with the 5700 the price
performance is there I will be taking a
look at the 5700 XT so hopefully by the
time I get that review out for you guys
I'll take a closer look at the
overclocking and also the extra feature
set involved and see if those bugs are
ironed out and another thing too is that
the aftermarket board partner cards will
be hitting the scenes a little bit later
this is the only model currently
available so I'd like to see the custom
solutions with jeweled fans even triple
fan solutions coming out and seeing how
much better they can overclock as well
as getting it backplate and stuff like
that because I will say before I get on
out of here that the build quality of
the 20
60 in the 2060 super especially the
founders editions are superior to that
of the 5700 even though it does have
better price performance there are
things that were sacrificed to get that
price performance but with that said I
hope you guys enjoyed today's review of
AMD's new navagrahas card if you did
then be sure to hit that like button for
us and also stay tuned be sure to hit
that sub button ring the bell because we
will be taking a look at these super
cards in their own dedicated review very
soon and without aside I'll catch you in
the next Tech video very soon he's out
for now bye
