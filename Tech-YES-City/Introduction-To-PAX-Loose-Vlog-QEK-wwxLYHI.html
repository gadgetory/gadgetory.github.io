I'll tell you what it's like so I just
finished playing this is called arcane
warfare Mirage I was an alpha and
actually really good there's two modes
that I play through our domination and I
sort of like move the whatever it is the

deep awesome game requires you know
so i'm here with ivana and she's from
derek's races she's actually recommended
me the purple chair yeah that's going to
be they all come in a bunch of different
colors but the right thing seriously
yeah so I thought it was just looks and
then I sat down in this purple one here
she recommended me the purple one I do
like a bit of mace windu from Star Wars
so it was it was matching up perfectly
but this thing the cool thing about it
is you've got a release free so that I
can just go all the way now another
thing about this chair right is that you
can you can actually hold the walking
position yeah that's what you were
telling me before so you pull this not
way back yep back though wakie the
morgue there we go lock it okay so now
I'm locked in my walking position is
locked in even though I've like put the
height of the chair you can lock in
different positions and you've got two
levers to right so I'm actually pretty
impressed yeah it's fun it's really and
it's great because like it was
interesting that little girl came in and
asked
she was tiny teeny tiny and she was like
what's the best chair here and I was
like well that's the most expensive but
it's not necessarily the best for you
because it's from Yale man that's like
66 350 pounds and so I put her in a ver
chair because it over there it was like
I love it's perfectly I mean it looked
like it's like almost like Goldilocks
