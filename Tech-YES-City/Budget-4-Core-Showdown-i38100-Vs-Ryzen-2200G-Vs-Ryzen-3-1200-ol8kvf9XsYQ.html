and you've got the appropriate threads
and attire to match and you've got a
hundred dollars in your wallet or in the
case of the a380 100 you might open 115
and your wallet and you're thinking
which for course should I buy so today
we're gonna be testing the rise in 2200
G versus the rising 3 1200 and then
compare that against the i3 8100 all its
stock settings out of the box with their
included stock coolers because if you're
probably getting into the market on a
budget you probably want to know which
is the best four core that you could put
in a system and then not have to worry
about changing any settings and getting
some good performance in games also on
top of that I'm going to be testing it
with a gtx 1060 which pairs up really
nicely in terms of price performance
with these four core CPUs so let's take
a look
welcome back to tell us city in the
first benchmark I'm going to pull off
for you guys is the fire strike
benchmark this one's probably the most
important it does paint the general
picture of the results that you're going
to see here today but you can see with
that fire strike physics core i3 80-100
did come on top scoring close to 8,000
points followed by the 2200 g scoring
over 7,000 points and then the rise of 3
1200 just came shy of that score the
graphics card scores were all pretty
similar across the board and same with
the combined scores but moving over to
far cry 5 first game were pulling up
here a 380 100 did score the victory was
68 average FPS some reason the Rison 3
1200 in this game did edge out the 2200
G by 1 FPS and this was a little bit
weird since the four cores on the rise
and 3 1200 is clocked lower especially
out of the box as opposed to the 2200 G
but the 2300 G does have less available
cash onboard CPU which is a utilize for
gaming in this case I believe this might
be the game where it just Falls a little
bit shy because of that but moving over
to project cars to 1080p high settings
and we see here across the board that
these three CPUs really scored similar
not just in average FPS but also 1% and
point one percent lows and there is a
little bit of variance in this benchmark
to begin with because it doesn't have an
inbuilt benchmark and of course the cars
will behave differently since they drive
in different ways every time you run the
benchmark and move over to the witcher 3
1080p high settings across the board we
scored 60fps except with the risin 320
200 G this did score 59 FPS and coming
in also with a lower 1% low 0.1% lows
however were pretty much even across the
board and I did run a few Mensch marks
on pretty much the same scene so this
was as close to apples-to-apples as
you're going to get with these
benchmarks so as we're that the Verizon
2200 G was falling a little bit behind
especially in this title and even far
cry 5 even though it was just a little
bit it was still a difference because I
do test multiple times but move over to
Assassin's Creed origins this is a game
where it really tanked for the
20200 g45 average FPS and then we
compare that to the Rison 3 1200 that
scored 52 fps
the i3 8100 did fit a lot better in this
game scoring 60 average FPS a the 0.1%
lows were actually the best however on
the 2200 G it's probably just variance
this is a console port so again that
optimization is not entirely the best
for PC the 1% loads however were pretty
similar across the board so they're
generally the numbers that you want to
look at when it comes to stuttering 0.1%
lows again is like that worst of worst
of worst outside of three standard
deviations aka and anomaly so now we
just finished up with those heavy games
that really stress the CPU but also
stress the GPU as well what about some
competitive multiplayer titles will see
us go is one of the first games that
comes to mind and here we saw the i3
8100 was scoring a little victory over
the 2200 G which then scored quite a
sizable victory over the Rison 3 1200 so
if you're into playing csgo and you're
going to buy either of these three CPUs
I wouldn't go with the rising 3 1200
unless you knew how to overclock it then
you could get some more performance out
of it but out of the box 2200 G or of
course the i3 8100 would be your best
bet to go with moving over to dota 2
however this was a similar story yet
again the i3 8100 coming out on top and
then followed by the 2200 G quite
closely and then the Verizon 3 1200
actually falling again quite a bit
behind so also in these games you will
want to have pretty high FPS due to the
competitive nature of dota 2 and csgo
and even games like fortnight and pub G
but the last benchmarking to throw off
for you guys is the Cinebench r15 score
and the results really kind of scaled
especially in these competitive games to
the Cinebench score itself I 380 100
scoring close to 600 points
Verizon 2,200 G scoring in the mid 500s
and then the horizon 3 1200 scoring
about 480 points there single-threaded
performance was a little bit weird 123
and then the 2200 G's
scoring 126 I 380 100 scoring close to
150 so now comes down to in my opinion
the most important part of a product and
that is the price and you've got the I
380 100 coming and around about 15 to 20
dollars more expensive then the risin
312 hundred and risin 320 200 G which
are both priced similar with just under
a hundred dollars at the moment on
amazon.com so between the two rides and
CPUs first of all which should you
choose my opinion I would go with the
2200 G does have that GPU portion on
board which performs similar to a GT
1030 and that's included for nothing
really it's also clocked higher out of
the box than the Rison 3 1200 so if you
aren't into overclocking then you would
be best off going with the 2200 G in my
opinion and some of those heavier tiles
like Far Cry 5 it only fell behind by 1
FPS but when it comes to the competitive
multiplayer titles the 2200 G did beat
the horizon 3 1200 by quite a lot so
that would be my pick however the
problem with the 2200 years so you have
to make sure that your motherboard is
200 series compatible if it's not you
may have some problems out of the box
the i3 8100 however you can couple that
with a cheap h3 10 motherboard just like
you could couple the rise and three with
a budget a 320 motherboard and you're
good to go in terms of playing games
however I will say one thing if you are
on the rise inside of things you might
want to go for a be 350 motherboard
which does have a lot more upgrade
ability than an a320 for example you can
put in an 8 core 16 thread on that
motherboard in the future and you've got
a great upgrade path as opposed to the
Intel side of things if you want to
upgrade you generally want to get a z3
70 motherboard with a better vrm onboard
and then you put in a 6 quart 12
threaded 8700 k although all these
options are more expensive so as it
stands the i3 8100 it does perform the
best in these benchmarks it is the
better gaming CPU in my opinion however
it does cost a little bit more also with
all three CPUs you do get an included
cooler - so you don't have to go out and
buy an additional cooler to get good
value out of these 3 4 core CPUs and if
you want to see how they compare against
an 8700 K then I rest
we tested the i3 8,100 burst the 8700 k
with the same gtx 1060 and it performed
pretty well anyway guys hope you enjoyed
today's video if you didn't be sure to
hit that like button and i'll catch you
in another tech video very soon also let
us know in the comments section below
which of these four cores
would you pick and why love reading
those opinions as always I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
