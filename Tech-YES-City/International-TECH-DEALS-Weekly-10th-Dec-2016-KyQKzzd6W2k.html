international tech deals one bite
accident before we get on with this
episode we'll say be careful of what
country you live in and the import taxes
associated with that country I know some
countries judge high import taxes even
on low value items i'll put a link in
the description below you can kind of
get an idea so hopefully you're not
buying something and getting hit with an
unexpected hi hefty fee but that said
let's get on with the first deal here
we've got the e3 1231 v3 CPU gone for
270 USD not bad considering this is in
four core eight threaded xeon and it's
on the Haswell architecture not only
that you can get a 3.8 you go that's on
all cores on the right motherboard now
this year hopefully this is the right
motherboard this is the Intel b85 socket
1150 mother will gun for 47 USD not only
that you can get it posted
internationally for 22 US dollars so not
such a bad deal is only two of those
available left so get on that deal
pretty quick also got the pic CEO
27-inch 1440p monitor this thing's got
the same IPS panel as the more expensive
a subpanel now the good thing about it
is only 390 USD considering how much
heftier the acer panel is and it's got
$64 us international shipping so you can
get this it's also a free sync also a
really good monitor and if you're in the
states you can get it for three hundred
and fifty dollars when you wake
themselves now the next year will go
here is an r7 370 going for eighty
dollars on newegg but not only that you
can get $15 rebate so you get this thing
for $65 after all the discounts so $65
for an r7 370 not a bad deal at all the
next deal for the people in the states
is the pen y gtx 1070 xlr8 edition now
this thing is a huge cooler another
things are going to cool really well but
the best thing about it is is that it's
three hundred eighty dollars after a
twenty-dollar mail-in rebate also with
that you get a free copy of watchdogs to
which is a really expensive title at the
moment so you get a triple a title I
don't know how good it plays but it's
still pretty good deal considering what
you get now the next deal we got here on
amazon is the zeus strict RX 470 going
for 175 dots so you've already got a
discount there then you get a twenty
dollar
so this brings this card down to 155
dollars are you freaking kidding me for
an RX 47 an awesome deal now going back
to newegg we got here harman kardon 5.1
channel surround sound speakers going
from six hundred dollars all the way to
170 dollars friggin deal as well if
you're looking for some syrup now moving
over to the UK we've got a 6800 k here
the i-76 cork 12 threaded CBU gone for
360 pounds pretty damn good considering
you're getting that discount it is x99
it is the latest and greatest cpu out
there at the moment you couple this with
the next 99 board and you'll have one
thing that's not only really capable for
gaming it's actually overkill for gaming
but you also have a great CPU for
editing videos don't productivity work
and what not now if you're looking for a
pretty damn cheap fully and get here the
Arctic freezer extreme ref to now face
value this thing doesn't seem like such
a discount you've only got a four
percent discount down but actually for
the money it is a really damn good deal
it's a huge cooler comes with a fan and
also support some of those older sockets
as well like 775 and 1366 so if you're
doing some old-school builds and you
want a really good cooler for the money
this thing is going to be it now another
deal for the people in the UK is the
Sennheiser pc 360 gaming headset and
usually I don't recommend gaming
headsets but this thing at 89 pounds has
a really good Mike you got that
sennheiser brand there with really good
headphone quality you're going to enjoy
this for 89 pounds especially if you're
a hardcore competitive gamer so next
deal i've got here is for Ozzie's but
also seems like it's for people in the
rest of the world 296 Australia dolls
for a one terabyte sshd now I just used
one of these in a build and I was really
impressed at the value for money you're
getting out of these things can highly
recommend it for 96 aud next year we got
here for aussies is a h110 and
motherboard going for 95 strain dolls a
couple this with an i3 6100 and you're
going to have a really good budget
gaming PC for the money now luster I've
got here's for Canadians got 150
canadian dollars and we got here 525
gigabyte SSD from crucial the mx300 I've
tested this thing I like this dr good
value for money especially at that price
