took a look at the B 450 steel legend
from asrock and that was on the AMD side
of things where the board had everything
you'd want from a board at a good price
point the bling the audio the neck USB 3
ports everything checked out
except it wasn't really intended for
overclocking the still legend on the
XIII 90 series wants to stick to that
trend coming in with a hundred and $45
USD MSRP the Ozzie price tag I will
update that in the description is slated
for a June release this year though of
course as with every motherboard here
around tokyo city we're gonna take it
through all the paces for you guys gonna
be testing it out with a ninety nine
hundred k and even though as we all can
for me not to really overclock it i'm
still gonna do just that and give you
guys the details
so straight away going over the vrm
details they're using niche akan 12k
caps as well as SMD 60 amp chokes a pwm
controller that consists of the up9 five
to one and then for low side MOSFETs are
using Sinnoh power for three three six
forty amps and then on the high side
Sinnoh power for three three seven
thirty-five amps with a six plus two
phase power design the heatsink itself
is actually a smart design covering the
input and output on the top down look
and also providing heat dissipation for
the vrm on the six phase side delivering
power to the CPU testing this out with a
ninety nine hundred k with stock
settings showed the vrm to go up to
about fifty five degrees on the heatsink
then about 84 degrees when we had the ir
camera on board this is using up about
95 watts four point three gigahertz this
was in a twenty seven degree ambient
controlled environment however when we
did step it up to a manual overclock of
five gigahertz which does juice a lot of
power going up to around 190 watt cpu
drawer alone we saw the vrm throttle the
cpu after about four minutes without a
fan over the vrm and the heatsink though
surprisingly once we added a 120
millimeter fan over this BRM the
temperatures then went down even at five
gigahertz drawing double the power at 74
degrees on the MOSFETs and 43 degrees on
the heatsink so you can see how much of
a difference adding that 120mm fan on
budget Z 390 motherboards can make a big
difference so with the vrm it's just as
asrock states it's not really intended
for overclocking though if you do want
to overclock don't forget a decent fan
and have it placed over that vrm and
whether things get a lot better when we
move over to things like the onboard
audio whether using the realtek ALC 1200
and although it's not the 12 20 it did
post some very impressive figures since
everything along that onboard audio line
is very good the caps included and we
saw a roll-off here of only 0.2 decibels
from 10 Hertz the 20 Hertz and then
underneath that 1.6 decibel roller so
it's gonna be great for powering mid
rage headphones and still giving good
clarity in the bass the rest of the
frequency response was pretty flat very
good numbers and then looking at the
crosstalk figures even at a hundred
volume level we saw the crosstalk going
under 80 decibels at full volume so
these were impressive numbers across
bought on the output though when it
comes to the audio input that's your mic
input we saw again some pretty good
numbers when I tested the mic and at
full volume 30 decibels it was like
showing a little bit of noise so they
weren't using noise suppression but when
we dropped that down to 80 volume even
at plus 30 dB the noise was virtually
non-existent so basically if you want to
get into streaming on a budget you've
already got a microphone and you don't
need noise or not that much at all then
this is going to be a great starting mic
out port moving on to the onboard net
the speeds here were very consistent
staying at around 108 megabytes per
second when I was doing a consistent
file transfer across my network USB 3
speeds checked out with my SSD maxing
out at 367 megabytes per second however
on the rear input and output they are
indeed changing that terminology and
we'll quickly go over here at the top
they've got the option to mount an MDOT
to Wi-Fi key which is in the middle of
the board and then below that you've got
USB I know it is originally three but
now it's called 3.2 gen one and then
down below that you've got USB 3.2 Gen 2
which is original USB 3.1 type a and
type C they're basically getting speeds
of 10 gigabits per second double of that
of USB 3 and then you've got USB 2 ports
2 of those as well if you wish to maybe
do a hackintosh build and you need that
USB to support you've got your 7.1
manual out as well as an optical out and
then besides that you get a ps2 hybrid
and also display an HDMI out to there
going through the rest of this
motherboard is standard ATX size though
on the side there is like a edged cutout
that's a sort of a stylish look to go
with that camo paint job on the board
itself you've also got m2 armor at the
top and bottom where one of those m2
ports is PCIe gen3 4x speeds but you've
also got an MDOT 2 which supports Asada
connectivity testing out temperatures
with the m2 armor does indeed not only
add to the aesthetics but also helps
keep the temperatures down on those
precious SSDs and it's especially a good
thing if you want to do video work with
a motherboard like this though now the
things I do like about this board is the
four SATA ports and also two down the
bottom for cable management options as
well as the USB 3s you've got two of
those
one at the site and also one down the
bottom and you've got two 12-volt RGB
headers and an addressable five volt
which can run through the actual BIOS so
you don't need to install any software
in the bias itself you got the
polychrome RGB option to control the RGB
with some new effects although there was
a typo in there but besides that the
BIOS works really well it's your typical
asrock bias with easy mode in advanced
mode all the features you'd want for
overclocking and even the option to
update the bus itself via an rj45
internet connection they lost in the bus
itself you gots different overclocking
profiles and the fantastic tuning
software which works really well it's
really simple to be used and you've got
five PWM controlled fan headers on the
board itself one up north two in the
middle and two down south and then
lastly RGB LEDs are all underneath the
right-hand side of the motherboard as
well as underneath the chipset heatsink
which is located towards the south of
the motherboard so now we've gone over
everything with this board it's time for
the conclusion with the z3 90 still
legend and I think it's hit all the
marks that asrock intended it to hit and
that's basically if you're not into
overclocking but you want everything
else at a pretty good price point of 145
USD then it definitely does hit the mark
of course if you want to get a ninety
nine hundred K go crazy with overclocks
and I'd suggest stepping it up to
something better from as rocks are in
line up they've got the Taichi but also
on that note if you don't want to
overclock and you want to get a fancy
water cooler you want the RGB you want
that Camel ascetic really good onboard
audio and everything else that just
really checks out with this board then I
can give it the all okay around here
though one thing I will critique was I'd
possibly like to see maybe Thunderbolt
add it in as I know there are people out
there that want to get Thunderbolt as
cheap as possible and still want to get
bling blings so that would have been
about the only thing really to critique
about this board but other than that the
aesthetic looks really good and I do
like it how they've laid out the options
with the USB front outs and also the
solid ports so they're thinking about
cable management in modern builds and
the RGB you can control that with in the
bias itself as opposed to some other RGB
software which can hit performance even
to that of 2% on a high-end build on
your CPU that's what things like the IQ
and also Zeus's software so it was nice
to see the bass control chipset that
doesn't affect performance
what
so ever any guys that's it for the z3 90
steel legend from asrock if you guys
enjoyed this review then be sure to hit

comments section below do you think it
is a legend at its price point yes or no
love reading your thoughts and opinions

another tech video very soon also if you
enjoying the content around here sub
button in the Bell button there down
there somewhere and also if you want the
inside scoop check us out on Instagram
check yes city you know catch you guys
in another video very soon peace out for
now bye
