and tricks with selling PCs today we're
gonna go through three different builds
what goes through my head when I'm going
to sell some of these pcs and sort of a
little bit of a vlog process on
especially one of the builds that I
picked up recently the 5820k and it does
look a little bit sort of like it could
use some tech yes loving so that's
exactly what we're gonna give to it
today a bit of tech yes loving but
there's two other builds as well one
being a Lenovo build which we're gonna
take a look at there because I've never
attempted to do a ring piece on a lenovo
case and then also we've got the
preparation of a Call of Duty PC which
probably might even get its own separate
video too who knows also for those
wondering about the three dollar cooler
we're testing it right now on a build
and it's running UniGene Heaven super
quiet and this has been going for over
half an hour so we're testing the side
panel off first and temperatures are
absolutely fine and here we have a side
panel on and nothing blew up we're only
running about two degrees hotter on
average I'd say than we were before and
we've also got a really nice aesthetic
there it is guys the three dollar cooler
and this is the tests that are I think
of way more real-world is how it runs in
games and stuff rather than how it's
going to actually run in a full out of
64 stress test and even then we've got
airflow from these two front fans that
it otherwise wouldn't have got on an
open air test bench so here's this build
here 5820k it's the case is really ugly
in my opinion there's it's a jungle
sandwich inside and it needs a different
graphics card i had a gtx 770 so what
we've done already is we pulled 16
gigabytes of ddr4 out because having 32
gigabytes for gamers really doesn't give
them any appeal and you're just honestly
throwing money down the toilet with the
price of ddr4 memory but we've also got
the fractal design focus g this is a
great case i find especially in
australian pick this thing up first
sometimes on sales for under $80 to
white LED fans white ascetic clear side
panel breeze to build with definitely
adds about
to a build and then we can use this
potato case for something else too but
without a Silas Poole old pod give it a
bit of test yes loving and then see the
final product so we just pulled this
cooler off and there's a couple of
things like this bracket just came off
so it was just free bowling on one side
god I was probably having heat problems
and then we've got these white gooey
stuff I've never come into a batch of
this stuff that's worked anywhere near
decent so looks like toothpaste and it
probably performs even worse than
toothpaste toothpaste actually does a
decent job in terms of thermal transfer
but anyway hopefully all the bads out of
the way we can get on with the good
and there's our build all ready to go
the SSD that came with it already had
Windows 10 prints stalls we don't have
to do any fiddling around this thing is
all good to go
there is the repurposed rig there and
now quickly after finishing this build I
check some deals and an i7 870 whole
system came up for ninety five dollars I
click the Buy It Now button and then I
put in the coupon code so I've got this
for $90 and it's just up the road pickup
so we're gonna go pick up this PC and
see what we're getting for ninety ozzie
dollars which would be like under 70 US
dollars really cheap anyway so we'll go
back before it's really late and I
realized that we're driving up the
highway and with twenty minutes up the
highway and I didn't have the guy's
address and so I messaged him and he
finally got back to me really late
tonight and so we're gonna go pick that
up tomorrow and yeah just one of those
things that happens but I've also been
training every day going to the gym so I
want to get look the best I can for the
upcoming health video for you guys gonna
be dropping that in three-part series
I'm gonna go crash out now and then
we're gonna hit this up in the morning
and here we are the next day with the
lenovo motherboard i got this in the
recent parts hunt for 85 bucks it's got
a nice three in it so what we're gonna
do is take the i3 out and put in this
little chip here the i-5 2400 because I
do want to test this in a few titles
especially with an Rx for 80 see if we
can handle for instance the latest Forza
4 and also this case here is going to be
a little bit of a problem and there's a
little novo case but it looks like it's
from a different generation as we've
tried to line up all the sensor
connectors and you can see that they use
these proprietary connectors so it is a
little bit of a problem to get it
working from the get-go but hopefully we
should be good to go once we get it
installed and shouldn't cause too much
problems hopefully fingers crossed
so here it is here now it's really messy
but that's just by default with the case
there's really nothing you can do about
it because these drives here they have
to face forward because there's no
options on the back it's just blocked
off completely and then we've got a lot
of proprietary connectors that are just
going all over the place so I figured
since it doesn't have a transparent side
anyway I've done my best to sort of
minimize the jungle over here and yeah
it's still a little bit messy but hey if
it switches on then it'll be awesome but
on the note of switching on I don't even
know if it will because some of the
priory connectors down here we're
actually a little bit different so I've
just plugged them into in and sort of
hoping and praying that they'll work so
here's the PC here it actually boots up
I was really surprised because this
connector as I said before I just
plugged it in and sort of on a plunge of
faith it's not really connected properly
but yeah it was connected to the power
button so some of these other connectors
they seem to be working fine the USB
front actually works too and the good
thing is this grabs card here the AMD
graphics card the rx series works off of
this board and I mean Lenovo have even
gone in and put in a red LED fan I'm
really happy right now so here it is
here here's the final product of this PC
it actually looks really nice in my
opinion for a non-transparent side
paneled case surprise Lenovo could
actually pull something this
decent-looking off and everything works
so that's pretty cool we repurposed the
case so someone gave it away it was just
junked to them so free case and then the
power supplies a budget power supply and
then we've used that $85 rig and then
$180 our X 480 that we picked up in the
parts on so we've got ourselves a PC for
around about 350 ozzie dollars here and
it just screams price performance
and last tip here on the desk is we're
gonna do this today but I figured some
of these pots are really nice and since
a lot of you guys wanted me to talk
about this in depth the overclocking on
the sixth gen I 5s and since this
apparently is a really good bin because
it's low power consumption I figured
would turn it into a separate video and
with Forza 4 just being released I
figured this could be a Forza 4 PC I
mean look at this case now I think about
it's not the prettiest case but it looks
like a bit of a race car it's got that
race car vibe we'll get a Superman shot
of it there we go it was a bit of wd-40
in the shot look at that Forza 4 there's
a thumbnail right there so now it's
finally time to go pick up that i7 PC
and check out what's inside
so we just got back now and here's the
Dell Vostro and it's looking good I mean
90 ozzie dollars for all this absolute
bargains got that i7 87 in it so we're
going to be doing a whole separate video
with this where I've got some rather
dubious plans to use this for something
so you have to stay tuned but I know you
guys won't forgive me if I didn't at
least give it a phase-one check yes love
him here it is right here on the table a
brand new Dell Vostro never been used
before I mean come on if that doesn't
bring up the PC really nice then I don't
know what does and here we are now with
the conclusion of what should you do a
different price points in different pcs
and what I took you through today was
sort of a little bit of a thought
process that goes through my mind I
always want to make sure that the case
the powerplay and all the other stuff
matches the certain price point like you
won't see me putting a really good water
cooler in a $300 PC because that's not
going to add value to the PC and on the
flip side you won't see me putting in a
really cheap cooler in a $2,000 PC
because I guess there's certain
expectations at certain price points and
now the easiest way to think of this is
to start exaggerating the situation for
instance if you're in the market for a
really expensive cards $20,000 or more
you are definitely going to be doing
your research and you're gonna be
searching everything does it have
bluetooth does it have heated seats and
you're eventually going to settle on
something that you want whether it looks
good or has the features that you're
after and so you're gonna research that
more but then we go to say for instance
a chocolate bar $1.00 chocolate bar at
the supermarket you're not gonna think
twice you're gonna be like okay that
looks good
it's gonna taste good I've tried before
$1 bang let's get it and so the thought
process involved is very little and so
now this same consumer behavior can then
apply to flipping pcs on the low end
people aren't gonna be doing too much
research so they're not gonna really
care too much about what you put in it
of course the better a PC looks at all
price points the better it's gonna sell
I guess that's a given and you can get
away nowadays with making pcs look good
for cheap but now that we're closing out
just make sure that your price points
are there and match the parts high-end
builds get high-end parts or even
mediocre parts at best mediocre builds
get mediocre parts some maybe low-end
parts but make sure they're not too
cheap and then low-end builds get
low-end parts if you're in a high-end
build for example do not put low-end
parts in a high-end build because most
people will be doing their research at
that higher level and will spot that out
and then they won't be too keen to buy
it but anyway guys what we saw with
those two builds today the 5820k build
we changed the case around to add some
value we added a water cooler and now
it's in my opinion a much better
higher-end build that will sell quicker
the mid-range build the Lenovo build put
in a mid-range case matched everything
up in my opinion is looking sweet and
it's good to go and with all that said I
hope you enjoyed this video if you did
then be sure to hit that like button let
us know in the comment section below do
you have any tips and tricks of your own
when it comes to sorting out different
price brackets and different price
ranges love reading your thoughts and
opinions as always and I'll catch you in
the next Tech video very soon peace out
for now play</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
