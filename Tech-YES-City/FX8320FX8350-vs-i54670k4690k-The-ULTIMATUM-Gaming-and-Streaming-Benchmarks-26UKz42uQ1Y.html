he finally coming back to you guys today
with the designer shirt with for the FX
8320 versus the for 670 K now you guys
want to know which is better for which
okay so I've tested these extensively
I've done single player benchmarks multi
player benchmarks streaming benchmarks
video rendering unzipping and all the
basically all the details and the test
set test bench setups and the details
for that are in the precursor video so
I'll put the link in the description
below today I'm going to be analyzing
all the results for you guys telling you
my thoughts and at the end of the video
I'm going to be doing a power
consumption calculation for you guys and
I'm going to be giving you guys the
formula so you can calculate it for
yourself and then also I'm going to make
some recommendations because both these
chips basically they have a they have a
point they have a reason to exist and
you know you're probably wondering
what's different
you know why is your video any different
than all the other Intel vs. AMD videos
out there well my video is different
because I hate both these companies I
hate them I don't like Intel and I don't
like AMD so what you're going to get
here is a hundred percent objectivity
now also I have this time around so
compared to the other videos we are
testing a GTX 780 overclocked lightning
Edition so if any card is going to
stress these CPUs it's going to be this
card so I've custom overclocked to
myself of setting a custom profile it's
as overclocked as this thing can go so
this thing is going to stress these CPUs
and if there's any results to be exposed
then this lightning will expose them
anyway let's move on now first to the
singleplayer benchmarks okay so let's
move on now with the singleplayer
benchmarks I'm going to be here down the
bottom in the middle for you guys
guiding you through these benchmarks and
talking about these numbers and
basically we have the four six seven TK
clocked at four point two gigs versus
the FX 8320 or 8350 pretty much the same
thing clocked at four point four gigs so
basically these are two overclocks that
I consider obtainable by anyone in the
overclocking community I haven't heard
of someone not being able to get there
for 670 K to four point two and I
haven't heard of someone not being able
to get their FX 8320 or 52 four point
four gigs so with that being said let's
move on to the first benchmark now this
was battlefield 4 which is an 8 threaded
game this was
on single player on the test range where
the conditions were replicated pretty
much precisely on both scenarios so
anyway let's look here we've got
battlefield 4 1080p ultra 2 times MSA a
with ambient occlusion off this is what
I like to play the game at and we had
150 3.2 on the average FPS for the Intel
and 155 our 45.96 so there wasn't much
between these two CPUs here really both
games are both CPUs offered a pretty
damn good experience when we contrast
that to 1440p the numbers the gap
diminishes and it's really there's
nothing between them at all so if you
want to play battlefield single-player
then it doesn't really matter if you
have an AMD or an Intel CPU let's move
on now to skyrim at 1080p
we had ultra settings clocked in no mods
at all this is just a plain vanilla
that's how I like to play Skyrim I
couldn't be bothered with mods as I just
clocked the game and that's it so let's
move on now the Intel scored 154 point
nine two versus the Andy which scored a
hundred and nine point one two so there
was a significant difference between
these two CPUs is it noticeable like
this is the point are you going to
notice these frame dips I are you going
to notice the frame difference actually
the answer is yes this the AMD did
exhibit a slight bit of screen tearing
where the otherwise the Intel did not
exhibit any screen tearing at all so
that was something that I found really
that's the difference here you see the
men dropped to 88 versus the minimum
which dropped to 124 now if we contrast
that to 1440p we pretty much see the
exact same results skyrim is a serious
CPU bound game it's ridiculous you got
the pretty much the exact same results
here at 1440p so if you are a Skyrim ER
with heavily modded
Skyrim you may be at a benefit of using
an Intel when you definitely will get a
benefit off using an Intel in that game
moving on now to BioShock Infinite at
1080p so this was ultra everything was
maxed in this game and it was a pretty
game we looked here we have the first
benchmark which is done on the level
where everything could be replicated the
same I walked forward I shot a gun off
and that was it 25 seconds and I did the
same shooting same sort of methodology
every time
and what we saw here was an average of
130 1.84 frames per second versus 140
6.08 so the Intel did score a slightly
higher average however this is the most
important thing to note there was there
was a part in the level where the frame
dipped and I believe this was part of
the level must have been a CPU part of
the level as we see here we got 70 on
the minimum and we have the Andy
dropping down to 33 which is a
significant difference this is when the
AMD started to exhibit some jitter you
know jittering and stuttering as opposed
to Intel which was relatively smooth
throughout that benchmark at 1080p when
we contrast this to 1440p we see a
similar scenario with it dropping down
to 33 frames per second again the
average frame rate dropped a little bit
this is a graphically intensive game and
we saw there 110 versus a hundred flat
the Intel again dropped down to only 59
frames per second so there was a
difference here between the two CPUs and
I do believe the Intel won this because
of the fact that it exhibited no
stuttering or jittering whilst I was
playing the game we move now to ARMA 3
so we got the 1080p on the right side
this time anyway ARMA 3 was the game
that exposed the biggest difference
between the Intel CPU and the AMD CPU
and what I'm talking here was a huge
difference we're talking a 50% on
average of 50% difference between these
two Freya I pretty sure this is actually
over 50% we saw the average here 46.0
for frames per second versus 75 point
one for frames per second there was a
huge difference between these two CPUs
and it was noticeable this was smooth
this was relatively smooth this was a
little bit choppy one thing note though
the minimums weren't too bad here 44 and
70 on the Intel so the Intel did score a
big win here in a big way when we
contrast that to 1440p that different
starts to diminish because the game does
start to get graphic GPU bound and we
saw the average drop to sixty eight
point two four versus forty six point
six eight so you can see here that is
just a huge difference in ARMA 3 so if
you're an ARMA 3
fanon or was it was actually a pretty
exciting game to play then you will want
to get an Intel CPU if you are on a high
end GPU but I'll get onto that later in
the recommendations moving on now to
Crysis 3 again that was a really popular
request from you guys I believe this is
a neat threaded game as well so anyway
we'll look at 1080p here on the right
we've got here forty seven point one six
frames per second on average from the
AMD but we look here at the Intel it's
got 60s in Scotts 63 FPS on average now
the biggest thing here was the the
minimum frame rate again it dropped down
to ten frames per second and this was
actually one of the worst jitters I
experienced that of all the benchmarking
I did I did have one in the streaming
but I'll get onto that later this was a
drop down to ten frames per second and
it felt horrible I was going it happened
the exact same time both three times I
did the benchmark and as when I was
moving to shoot the guy and yeah it just
really started and it was really
noticeable and the Intel did score 32 so
it did drop down to a little bit of a
relatively choppy scenario but it was a
lot better than the FX 83 20 at this
stage when we contrast that to 1440p we
had here an average frame rate of 40 one
point eight versus thirty six point four
eight so that difference does start to
diminish crack crysis 3 is a seriously
graphics graphically intensive game
however that minimum frame rate noticed
that minimum frame rate again dropped
down to a round drop down to 11 in Intel
it maintained the 31 FPS so there was a
part in the level that must have had
some sort of physics that the CPU
couldn't cope with on the AMD however
the Intel managed to cope with it
relatively fine when we move now to the
last game we had Batman Arkham Asylum at
1080p we had heared the game scoring 120
point one six average FPS on the AMD
versus 157 point eight eight now these
this was everything max 2 times MSA
basically in a nutshell this game was
absolutely fine on both CPUs it did not
make a difference at all the AMD on 1440
put 1440p closed the gap even further
and there wasn't much of a difference
between these both these CPUs played
Batman Arkham
absolutely fine so anyway let's move on
now to the multiplayer benchmarks
alright so now we're moving on to the
multiplayer benchmarks and basically
this is going to have variants it can't
be helped it's a multiplayer game where
there's people standing in different
places at all time firing different guns
doing different things so it's not going
to be a hundred percent there's going to
be hundreds inaccurate there's going to
be variants however I did try to
eliminate as much variance as possible
by doing trying to do the same pattern
of things firing the same guns firing
the same rocket at the same place only
driving cars and sticking to land and
this was done on the map called lane cam
dam and the benchmark was done three
times over 200 seconds and if anything I
did try to make sure I was always firing
a gun with the Intel so if anything I
tried to stress the Intel as much as I
could
however the AMD did manage to score
ninety point four eight at 1080p and the
Intel did manage to pull away a little
bit with 113 point 535 the minimum frame
rate was the most interesting here we
did have a thirty nine minimum frame
rate had dropped to thirty nine FPS on
the ND with the Intel sustaining 77 so I
did think I did notice this frame drop
and it was when I was firing a rocket I
did notice the jittering the Intel
didn't display any of that jittering at
1080p when we move now to 1440p the
differences start to diminish and we
have here 78 versus 72 so the minimum
frame rate again was similar to the
1080p result so there was a part that
was there was I think this this frame
drop was CPU due to the CPU again it was
when I was firing a rocket the Intel
managed to drop down to 51 here which I
do believe this frame drop may have been
caused by the GPU however I think this
these results for battlefield 4 if
you're on especially if you're on an AMD
graphics card are going to be mitigated
because they have released their mantle
update which if you have an AMD graphics
card it helps out and it reduces the
load on the CPU so if you got 99 to 90
and an AMD and you're playing in all you
do is play battlefield you don't have to
really worry about these results however
if you have an AMD I mean a Nvidia
graphics card then you may wish to
couple it and you're playing battlefield
4 then you may wish to either sell your
Nvidia graphics card I'll get an Intel
CPU if your die
a battlefield de hell in fatal
battlefield player who loves his
battlefield anyway let's move now to
Star Wars The Old Republic a game that
I'm currently playing through the
campaign it's actually a lot of fun I am
liking the camp plant campaign
I have heard different stories about the
PvP but anyway let's move on to the
results here we had eighty point three
two at 1080p versus 106.9 - it is
important to note that this game does
have a frame cap built into it at 112
frames per second now this is just on
the part of the map where I can run
around and kill monsters and pretty much
replicate this exact same results every
time
and it was 58 versus a hundred versus 95
the minimum frame rate so I'm going to
pay attention to minimum frame rate
because I did notice a little bit of
screen tearing on the ad as opposed to
the Intel which is pretty much exhibited
a smooth gaming experience we move on
now to 1440p Ultramax the intel did
manage to maintain that smoothness the
AMD did manage to drop a little bit more
with the air the frame rates falling to
sixty six point two four versus the
Intel which means maintain 105 point
three six so if we contrast that back to
the 1080p there wasn't really a
difference between Star Wars at between
1440p and 1080p on the intel have at the
end it did manage to drop quite a bit of
it quite a chunk there so let's move on
now to sc2 Starcraft 2 now this is a
game surprisingly everyone says oh man
intel beats the AMD at Starcraft 2 and I
did find that it did beat it by a little
bit however I found that both times this
was ultra and everything was maxed and I
just played what I did was I played
Terran and I just played a normal game
where I was building Marines and I did
build my siege tanks and I just attacked
and I found that both CPUs played this
game absolutely fine it was a smooth
experience on both even though the Intel
did beat it at 1080p I thought there was
just no difference here like in terms of
playing the game it was playing on fire
both CPUs absolutely fine maybe if you
get into a huge huge battle and you're
one of those guys who always gets into
huge battles then the Intel might
exhibit more frame a bigger FPS boost
but you know 1440p the differences were
diminishing
and we had 105 versus 98.5 - so both
games played Starcraft 2 absolutely fine
that's what I'm going to say there here
is a new ethic game this is my favorite
game and it's a MOBA game so basically
you guys who played dota will know um
dota 2 and you guys who play League of
Legends will know what MOBA games are
there are a lot of fun I love it here is
in u.s. I just love it even though it's
a pretty imbalance game I enjoy playing
and that's the main thing you should
enjoy playing your video games what we
had here was ninety one point five nine
at 1080p versus one hundred twenty two
point three five eight now this game
does have a frame limit built into the
game in 127 125 frames per second both
of these CPUs managed to hit that frame
cap however the minimum frame rates
again there was a big difference with 90
versus 50 so at one point that I played
a character called blitz and I played in
the exact same Lane every time so the
results were pretty accurate here the
Intel did manage do not exhibit any
jitter as opposed to it you know when
dropped down to 50 frames per second it
was a slight doodle and that's the thing
even though the it only shows 50 frames
per second the jittering like they're
basically a frame would have started so
it would have been actually lower than
50 FPS if I did a frame Lancie test it
would show that as well anyway we've got
here 1440p we had here the difference
started to pronounce it was the
difference here was a me sorry the
difference was pretty much the same as
it was at 1080p
we had 119 FPS versus 86 or 87 and we
had the minimum of 49 versus 84 so that
minimum frame rate was pretty much the
same as it was at 1080p which means
there was I was doing something that was
causing the CPU to jitter both times at
1080p and 1440p on the AMD so let's move
on now to the planetside 2 which was a
really was a game that was requested a
lot by you guys here we have the Intel
exhibiting a hundred and thirty three
point six frames per second versus the
AMD which exhibited seventy six point
five one frames per second so there's
almost a 100 I mean
it's a significant difference in frame
so if you're playing planetside 2 you
will want an Intel CPU I don't know why
the difference is this big but it's huge
and keep in mind this was really a
subtle benchmark I didn't get into any
battles
I just ran around the base firing a gun
it was just to see how the CPU is
performed in this game and you guys are
getting a rough picture of how it
performs the Intel does pull away by a
lot in this game if we contrast that to
1080p
it looks like the AMD caught up a little
bit as but it was still CPU bound it's
pretty much the exact same result
seventy six point five one versus
seventy six point three one with the
pretty much the same minimum frame rate
there so the exact same minimum frame
rate actually we the Intel did start to
get GPU bound here which was interesting
105 point 2 9 vs 133 point 3 to 6 so the
bottom line with this game is if you are
playing planetside 2 you will most
likely want an Intel CPU so that was
that part let's now move on to the
streaming benchmarks ok so basically
these are the next benchmarks I did I
decided to test two games that I would
personally be streaming in the future I
then decided that I was going to test
them at 1440p and downscale it to 1080p
with dxtory
and then send that through OBS to twitch
TV I then decided to capture the frame
rates with fraps on top of that and
these are the results that I got first
up was battlefield 4 which is an 8
threaded game so if anything this should
have been in favor of the AMD however
this is where things surprise me the
Intel scored an average of 64 point 5 4
frames per second as opposed to the AMD
which scored 36 point 8 2 and look at
these minimum dips this went down to 9
fps as opposed to Intel which only
didn't only dip 256 frames per second
basically what one was streamable the
Intel did was playable and was
streamable the AMD was just a horrid
experience if you wanted to stream this
on a gigabytes of RAM now people are
wondering why the AMD so do so bad here
I believe it has to do with just that
the 8 gigabytes of RAM I believe as you
guys know the Intel does utilize memory
better than the aim
d-does so I believe this problem would
be alleviated if I put in 16 gigabytes
of RAM so basically the lesson of lesson
out of this was to if you want to stream
battlefield 4 and you're on an AMD have
16 gigabytes of RAM let's move on now to
Han where things were not memory
it wasn't bottlenecking the memory was
not bottlenecking or something else was
not bottlenecking these two games the
Intel managed to score one hundred and
three point eight six frames per second
with the minimum of 72 so it was a very
smooth experience on the Intel the AMD
dropped down to fifty seven point three
four frames per second with a minimum of
forty three FPS so the AMD was a little
bit choppy as opposed the Intel which
was a smooth experience for streaming
here as a new earth now this I I don't
know basically in a nutshell the Intel
was better for streaming than the AMD
was so I don't know where people are
telling me people telling me look man
the AMD is better for streaming I don't
know where you guys are getting these
rumors from but the Intel clearly one
here and basically if you guys want to
stream in you're serious about streaming
I do recommend getting sixteen gigabytes
of RAM though ok so let's look at some
rendering and unzipping and also a test
with UniGene value that I did first up
we have the Premiere Pro 6 rendering
time so lower is better here basically I
took a video and I it was like a three
minute video I think and it was
basically I just did the apply the same
settings the the same Mbps rate on both
same audio on same 30 frames per second
at 1080p rendered it to mp4 and this is
the results the Intel at 4.2 gigahertz
managed to do it in two minutes and 19
seconds the AMD managed to do it in 3
minutes per notch three minutes flat so
the a the Intel was faster at rendering
a video now let's have a look at the
unzipping a file and basically we had
WinRAR we unzipped an 8 gigabyte file
which is pretty damn huge and the Intel
did it in 2 minutes and 15 seconds and
the AMD managed to do it in 3 minutes
and 11 seconds so on both these two
real-world tasks that I do for me
personally the the AMD lost the Intel
one so I don't know
people say rendering is faster on the
eight core the four core beaters so I'm
a bit surprised there when we move on
now to UniGene valley benchmark this is
a this is one of the game this is one of
the benchmark synthetics I'd like
because it's just a really graphically
intensive benchmark and it also tells
you about power consumption as well but
we'll get on the power consumption next
we have we have here a scorer at 1080p
of 4221 on the Intel and the AMD managed
to score 3176
however when we contrast this to 1440p
we do see the difference diminish a lot
with the AMD scoring 2461
and the Intel scoring 2675 so that
difference is really diminished at 1440p
I mean if you went up to 4k as well the
differences would diminish as well so
practically be non-existent at 4k okay
so next up we have power consumption and
this is a sort of it is pretty important
for in order to get to the correct
recommendation which CPU is best for you
we saw here with the idle difference
there really wasn't a lot in it I think
was about 25 watts so I did just check
my power meter and I did just round it
to the nearest five just to make it
simple when we're doing the calculations
so it idled at 135 versus 110 on the
Intel so there wasn't much difference
there I mean the Eiling wasn't much of a
difference there however when we looked
at a game like Crysis 3 this is where
things got heavy and actually this is
this was a really interesting thing for
me too because I've never seen my power
supply pushed so hard before the AMD
managed to take it to 625 watts and the
Intel also managed to take it up to 570
watts so there was a 55 watt power
difference and this surprisingly also
scored a higher wattage then UniGene
Valley did which was pretty surprising
for me so Crysis 3 very intensive game
if anything yeah maybe it's something to
be careful of because if you have a weak
power supply this game may indeed crash
a power supply but it's a merit to the
antek earth what 650 watt because it
handled these lamp ample fine so within
some so anyway we look at now the powers
competent power consumption during
Heroes of Newerth
and we saw here 265 versus 330 so there
was about a 65 watt power difference
here and then we have the last was
battlefield 4 with about 575 watts
versus 540 so that wasn't actually a
different that much of a difference in
battlefield 4 so overall I'd say that
maybe be a 50 watt difference if you're
gaming the difference between these two
CPUs it wasn't that big
however 50 watts is still 50 Watts extra
that you get a pay so again I've done
some quick calculations here and
basically this is the question you have
to ask yourself I put the formula in the
description below so if you live in a
country that where you're paying a lot
per kilowatt hour like I am then put
that price into the formula put how many
hours a day on average use your computer
or you're going to game and then do the
math for yourself basically I use
probably about 4 hours a day the
computer so I've done the maths here for
me in Japan the differences between
these two CPUs for me would be about 25
dollars and 55 cents a year for you guys
in Australia if you're playing 4 hours a
day it'd be about 21 dollars and 17
cents so if you're in the States
again the states is really cheap 8
dollars and 76 cents you guys are paying
a thing like 12 cents a kilowatt-hour an
average it's dirt cheap instead power is
pretty damn cheap you know I'm paying
like 35 cents a kilowatt-hour in Japan I
know the Aussies are paying about 29
cents that's what my mum was paying when
I went back at Christmas and so you can
see here that it depends where you live
honestly eight dollars and 76 cents is
not that much if you live in the States
I don't think power is going to be too
big concern however you do live in a
country where we're paying a lot per
kilowatt hour then this is something to
think about if you want to own this CPU
for two or three years then add that up
for me it would be about a $50
difference I'm guessing over two years
so that's something to think about
anyway let's move on now to the final
and the recommendations where I'm going
to talk about which CPU to recommend to
you guys and which because they're both
good in different scenarios and I'm
going to talk about that in the
recommendations now okay so you guys
have made it this far too
the recommendations and basically the
recommendation is going to be cut and
dry however it's going to be similar to
the precursor except I'm going to talk
about it more in depth today and I
talked about when's the best cases for
which when should you buy which because
they're both valid purchases let's talk
about the FX 8320 first okay so this is
the eight core and also I'll talk about
the FX 6300 as well because these two
CPUs represent great value at a certain
level and I'm going to talk about that
level and that is the mid-range level
when you I've recommended this thing in
the past for a hundred and thirty
dollars I've seen it go for one hundred
and forty dollars it's extraordinarily
good value for money when you couple it
with a budget a am3+ 970 motherboard
it's a really good CPU I mean you're
paying what $60 for a and three-plus
motherboard $130 for the CPU getting a
really good combo for $190 then put that
money towards a graphics card say GTX
760 or an i-9 - sorry 99 to 70 and
you've got yourself one really good
balanced gaming rig so as you guys
throwing the results though when we
start to go with the high end graphics
card the especially the GTX 780 I then
took that taken a graphics card
overclocked it more and it's pushed
these CPUs to the brink and so when I
push these CPUs to the brink that's when
the Intel started to pull ahead and in
some cases it was a huge difference I
mean you saw planetside 2 I was like I
was ninety percent or something extra
frames that was just too big to say that
it wasn't a difference I mean and so you
know you guys probably wondering wolves
people have tested these things in the
past and there was only like a 5 FPS
difference there wasn't much of a
difference but times have changed I mean
the GTX 780 has been released the r9 290
has been released and you know when
these people did their tests they tested
it on what would be considered now
mid-range graphics cards so I think this
update is I think it's a necessary thing
for the tech world and the tech
community and I'm glad I could do it for
you guys because I want to end this
debate I'm sick of you know I'm sick of
arguing Intel versus Andy I'm just god
I'm blown out of my mind here anyway ok
so let's move on now to the Intel when
is this the Best Buy basically the Intel
does definitely represent
money when you're going with a high-end
graphics card as you guys saw in the
tests here this was done with the GTX
780 that I overclocked myself to the max
it can go and in some games the
differences were freaking huge I mean
look at planetside 2 that was a huge
difference look at arma 3 arma 3 was a
pretty damn fun game by the way thanks
for recommending me that that was a
really good game
I enjoyed that the differences in ARMA 3
with big - so basically if you guys are
going with a high-end graphics card then
get the Intel CPU you're going to
benefit I think honestly this CPU does
get underestimated a lot if you guys
didn't know this currently has the best
IPC on the market it beats Intel's own
six cores in single threaded
applications because it's got the best
IBC therefore 960 X is only on the Ivy
Bridge architecture this is on the new
Haswell architecture which has better
IPC than the six core so I think this
thing gets underestimated a lot even
because it's only a four core don't let
that elude you most things don't even
run on four cores at the moment I mean
some games are running on eight threads
but this thing on four threads will max
any single GPU you can throw at it as we
saw in the results here it's one hell of
a CPU for the money and it is I think it
does get underestimated a lot everyone's
like at the 4770k don't worry about the
4770k for 670 K is really good value for
money I mean if you are streaming and
you're serious about streaming and you
do a lot of rendering then the four six
then the 4770k will be a good buy if
it's going to save you a lot of time
generally the four six seven ta is
really good CPU when you couple it with
a high-end graphics card and that's my
recommendations there I'm going to talk
about so basically let's cut that FX
8320 great value for money when you
couple it with a mid-range graphics card
this is great when you couple it with a
mid to high-end graphics card sort of
like your gtx 770 your gtx 780 or r9
280x or your r9 290x this is a great
graphics great CPU to couple with a
high-end graphics card let's talk about
more things though this is what I didn't
mention in the benchmarks I'm going to
talk about a little things as well the
Intel I mean there's the power
difference as well sorry I'll talk about
that now quickly
power difference if you pay a lot for a
kilowatt hour go check your power bill
if you pay a lot for a kilowatt hour
then that's probably you're going to be
another factor where you're going to
want to consider the Intel over the AMD
as for me for instance it would probably
amount to around I know maybe $50 over a
few years that's that's money that
you're going to save if you get the
Intel if you live in the states it's
going to be sewing significant that you
don't have to worry about it because you
guys are paying 12 12 cents a
kilowatt-hour so do the calculations for
you do the calculations for you I'm not
sitting in your chair playing games for
you you're sitting you know I'm sitting
in my chair playing games for me so I'm
going to get what's best for me and
that's what I want you guys to get
what's best for you these are my
recommendations this is what I'd
recommend myself what I'm recommending
you guys today is what I'm recommending
myself and it's same with my budget
builds this is what I would buy when I
do my budget builds so you get where I'm
going anyway let's talk about now lastly
talk about different some sort of
Augmented things that I didn't mention
in the benchmarks okay so why didn't you
do frame latency testing
I decided leave frame latency testing
out because it was only going to show
that the Intel was beating the AMD
because of those minimum frame rates I
think that's proof enough they're the
minimum frame rates already proved that
the Intel had better frame latency than
the AMD not to mention frame Lancie
testing takes me a long time to compile
and I'm ready spent a huge amount of
time doing these freaking tests and yeah
like you know I enjoy doing it though I
do enjoy doing it in hindsight it's just
I got a lot on my plate
IRL and you know I'm a busy guy IRL so
design a shirt for the wind but you know
we go now this is the something I'm
going to talk about with these CPUs the
Intel and this is the reason why I put
it back in my rig after I finished the
test on the AMD I put the Intel back in
because it was faster in general usage
and this is another thing as well I
don't think a lot of people mentioned
the Intel loaded up installed things
quicker it loaded up quicker it loaded
up games quicker it multi dit alt-tab
quicker it changed freaking graphics
settings quicker
there was just did every general usage
thing quicker than the FX 8320 did and I
think that's something that doesn't get
mentioned because in I was so used to
using my for 670 K that when I went to
my MD it frustrated me a little bit in
some circumstances so that's something
as well to consider you've got you know
a lot of threads a lot of games aren't
already a lot of applications out there
besides games aren't eight threaded you
know a lot of games a lot of
applications are still only single or
dual threaded so you got to keep that in
mind the Intel is going to do better in
all those applications
besides gaming you're probably wondering
as well with the FX 8320 it's an eight
core why didn't it do so well in the 8
in the 8 threaded games what did well in
the 8 threaded games so just drop some
sticky down it did well in the 8
threaded games it's just that the Intel
even only on four threads managed to max
the graphics card you've got four cores
of CPU running against one core on a GPU
you're going to keep that in mind this
thing on four threads max the GTX 780
ample fine so that's something did not
forget about so I thought you know in
all-in-all it's this is what it is and
that's the recommendations I made I hope
you guys enjoyed this whole series and
I'm going to get back onto my budget
build soon they'll be coming next and
I'm going to be getting onto some
reviews I got to get a lot of sound a
lot of sound things to do and yeah
that's about it so okay so that pretty
much wraps it up I hope you guys enjoyed
this series of the FX 8320 versus the
intel honestly I had a lot of fun
building a new rig I'm going to get you
guys do not worry I'm going to get a lot
of guides done for this I'm going to
talk about the tweaks I'm going to talk
about the different settings in the bass
to tweak to get the best FPS out of this
thing I'm also going to do an
overclocking tutorial for you guys on
the AMD CPUs and also I'm going to be
doing the review on the parts that I
used on the AMD as well because then
I've got a salman case there to review i
didn't use that for the AMD yet but i'm
going to be putting the AMD rig in that
case i've also got the big Zalman cooler
to review
which I've got mixed opinions about I
mean look it's a great cooler it works
well it's just the installation is one
of the worst in the world anyway but
I'll give you guys a review on that soon
and I hope you guys enjoyed this video
like I mean is a long video but if
you're still here with me then I love
you guys a lot so basically you know I'm
always going to keep giving you guys the
truth I don't give a about these
companies and their sponsorship deals or
whatnot and you know that's ultimately
because I care about you guys as
individuals and that's what that's more
important to me no mommy and daddy
raised me properly and I got dignity and
I got pride I got a lot of it I think
too much at times so you know no look
I'm comfortable YouTube's not my living
I'm comfortable I got a good an
excellent job I you know life's good
don't worry
 yeah take care City baby so if you
haven't already hit that sub button and
I'm going to be coming back with more
tech videos for you guys because I love
doing it and hit that like button too
because this took me a long time to do
this is like one of the biggest missions
I have done in my life and did a lot of
testing pulled out a lot of hairs it's a
shame I'm freaking I'm surprised I'm not
bald yet but yeah you know this was fun
I'm gonna build a new PC I'll showcase
the AMD PC for you guys and I'll do a
video on that too so anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed this and peace out for now
ah
and another thing we got a new alias
coming baby it ain't Brian easy anymore
I mean I've got a cure the tech world of
fanboy ISM so I'm now dr. easy you guys
can call me the doc I'm going to be
cleansing the tech world of fanboy ISM
one fanboy at a time anyway peace out
for now doctor easy
bye okay so first up we had here
battlefield 4 now this is probably one
of the most requested games well
actually a lot of these games were
requested a lot that's why I did them
all but anyway we had the i-5 for 670
clay K clay for 670 clay cocked it
cocked G the the i-5 for 670 clay cocked
at 4.2 gigahertz
God welcome back to TECA cities behrani
Z coming back to you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
