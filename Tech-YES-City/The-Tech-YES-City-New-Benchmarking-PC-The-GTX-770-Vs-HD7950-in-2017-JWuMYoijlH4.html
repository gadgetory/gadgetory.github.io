appeared this was the yes man's
overclocking changes of Secrets
just like the silicon lottery when one
is to enter the chamber there is no
telling how one may come out first time
in Brian was gifted with a benchmarking
PC his father after seeing how lucky his
son was soon decided to take the chance
as well however he unfortunately got in
the lower echelon of the drawer and
turned out with the power that enabled
him to focus on detail that is the
expense of looking quite terrible you
may be asking what does this have to do
with anything well just like the yes
mans overclocking chambers of secrets
this benchmark PC is a new concept for
the channel hope you enjoyed that intro
guys and welcome back to tech yes City
this is brian coming to you guys today
with a new pc that is going to help me
in the quest for giving you guys the
most consistent benchmarks possible so
without wasting any more of your time
let's take a look at the past i've
initially put in this pc and then of
course run some benchmarks for you guys
oh and also in case you're wondering I
originally did have a 280 X which would
have been a great apples apples
comparison especially to the gtx 770 but
unfortunately i got hosed on the deal so
i have to instead use the 7950 but let's
see how find these drivers have
cumbersome videos and yes i did only
test one card at a time of course both
cards in the rig are just for the b roll
easy
there it is for both the benchmark I
thought both cars honestly did pretty
well the 7950 did do a little bit better
for its age and this was the car that I
got 480 Australian dollars which is
about 60 USD the GTX 770 I managed to
get that for about a hundred AUD or 75
USD so it's all pretty relative I guess
and both cars had to be cleaned and have
their thermal paste replaced though when
it comes down to it I would actually
prefer the 7950 with three gigabytes of
vram over the gtx 770 as you can see
with these games the extra gigabyte of
erm made a big difference and this was
only on some games medium for example on
dishonored to that gtx 770 was getting
capped out there as opposed to the 79 50
which was actually managing to run
absolutely fine with the three gigabytes
of vram as for the 280x I believe the
vram on that card is just simply
shattered self so it doesn't work at all
as soon as you install the drivers oddly
enough though on the windows basic
display adapter driver it works since I
do believe it doesn't recognise being
round properly through that driver hence
why I believe the video memory is faulty
though that is just my guess and I've
already tried flashing the bass with a
severely under clocks profile and that
still didn't work so this thing is quite
literally history the person should have
never have sold it as working fine
because it doesn't work fine at all but
anyway that's the risk you are always
going to get with use parts some scammer
trying to offload and swindle his way
out of a hundred dollars such is life
though it's for better news the path in
this build which a lot of them were sent
out as build samples from Corsair and
MSI the 460 X was probably the weakest
link though I much preferred the 570 X
as I thought that had a bit more room
and everything was easier to work with
the 460 X however was
bit of a hassle when it came to things
like installing the powerplay
reattaching covers and also the cable
management at the back was very minimal
and on top of that I had to mount the H
110 fans on top of the case so that does
look like a bit of Awesome and they are
very quiet the RM 850 power squad is
really smooth and quiet and has a fan
that spins down when the computer is in
idle and the 5.1 Giga overclock on the
CPU is very aggressive considering it is
in the dead heat of summer here in 30
degree + temperatures and that is
supplied juice by the best v 270
motherboard I have reviewed that is the
msi z2 70 titanium though it is very
expensive keep that in mind so the
benchmark PC is all good to go and up
and running to give you guys some juicy
comparisons especially when another CPU
and motherboard combo hits the channel
and you guys that's about it for the
benchmark PC if you like this video then
be sure to hit that like button and let
me know in the comments section below
what was your favourite piece in this
benchmark PC I personally love that
triple slot cooler and also the tapes
110 fans mounted on top of the case it
was different looks cool and performs
pretty well and also I haven't branded
this PC and name yet I was thinking of
calling the King ding-a-ling let me know
you think of that and I'll catch you
guys in another tech video very soon
leave now for now bye
the yes man's overclocking chambers of
secrets will be continued</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
