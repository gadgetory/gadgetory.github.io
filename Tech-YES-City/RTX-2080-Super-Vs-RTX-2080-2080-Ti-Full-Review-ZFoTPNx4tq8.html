bit of an enigma where the 2060 suit bar
was actually a cut-down
RTX 2070 and the RTX 2070 super was
actually a cut-down r-tx 2080 though the
r-tx 2080 super here on the desk is
actually a beefed-up rgx 2080 was
slightly more CUDA cores and actually a
sizeable boost to the memory speeds it
promises more FPS though of course with
the RT X xx atti coming in at a thousand
us and being the top dog how close is
this beefed up our TX 2080 super
compared to the 2080 TI let's roll the
benchmarks and see if this gravis card
has the gravitational pull
and with all the benchmarks done we can
now paint that picture on the r-tx 2080
super a little bit better and we tested
with 1440p and 4k and the reason we
didn't test 1080p is because it will
pull up the farcry new dawn benchmarks
1440p we can see here that this was
actually incurring even at this
resolution a bit of a CPU bottleneck
with the r-tx
2080 TI really only coming a little bit
ahead of the super and then all the
cards sort of fitting in the same
ballpark but when we switch over to 4k
you can see that the numbers start to
separate a little bit more but what you
can see with the 2080 super is it's
coming closer to the 2080 than it is to
the 2080 ti
maybe it was a strange brigade both at
1440p and 4k shows the 2080 super
pulling a little bit ahead of that of
the 2080
but still falling a little bit behind
that of the 2080 TI and then going over
to Tom Clancy's the division 2 on DX to
12 we can see here this game now for T
for T P in particular the 1% and 0.1%
lows are a little bit inconsistent here
but then moving over to 4k they become a
little bit more consistent when the CPU
isn't as much at play as it is at 1440p
going over to F 1 2019 does show a
similar trend and a 1440p though the
Radeon 5700 XT is actually performing
very well on this particular title and
pretty much making the Radeon seven of
so late especially since it uses better
power and we'll pull up the power
consumption figures here where the
Radeon 7 is doing the best out of the
bunch but the 2070 super in 2080 super
are doing well especially when we
compare them to the 20 atti in terms of
their overall power consumption and a
2080 overclocked does do pretty well
especially compared to that 20 80 TI and
the reason we're putting that power
consumption result in there is this
going to paint a pretty big picture when
we move over to shadow of the Tomb
Raider where we did test this at 1440p
and 4k and it did follow that similar
trend as we've seen before but when we
started to overclock the 20/80 super it
started to pull closer to the 20 80 TI
and started to pull away from the 20 80
and this is actually a pretty import
Graff to pull up here because when we
did overclock that 28 is super it did
respond pretty well gaining about nearly
10 percent performance overall in the
FPS numbers at both 1440p and 4k and
that's where this card does start to
make a little bit of sense when we start
to see what it can do it 1440p
overclocked because with the 20 80 TI
overclocking that thing does start to
put out a lot more heat than it does it
at stock figures here we're adding about
25 watts on and we're still coming well
below that of a 28 each in terms of
power consumption figures but we are
getting closer to those FPS numbers on
this particular card but the Nvidia RT X
cards also include support for DL SS
which is their super sampling based on
the AI portion of the RT x graphics
cards and here we can see at 4k on
shadow of the Tomb Raider it does get a
performance boost but pulling up a side
by side by side comparison here shows
that it does leave a lot to be desired
in terms of comparing that to a native
4k image so yes you do gain more
performance but you do lose out in image
quality and to be honest I wouldn't be
buying one of these cards for the DL SS
support feature though moving on to the
ray-tracing benchmark this is port royal
and it shows that the 2080 Ti is coming
out quite a bit ahead of that of the
2080 Super and then the 2080 in office
of 2070 super seem to be in a similar
league in terms of their rate racing
performance they're moving back to that
note of overclocking we can see that the
speeds here averaged out at about two
point zero five gigahertz though with
the 2080 Super the memory speeds have
been overclocked significantly compared
to that of any other RTS gravis card so
it's as if they're using Bend GDR six
memory on this because even out of the
box it's quite fast faster than that of
the 7000 megahertz on most RTX cards and
when you overclock it it did respond
very well and got some good overclocking
performance even more so on that GT dr6
memory now the good thing with the 2080
Super at least the founders edition
we've got here was that even overclock
the temperatures and noise was well
under control pulling up the fan speed
and thermal graph here we can see that
at 60% we do score a pretty good sweet
spot topping out a 69 degree
Celsius in a 24 C ambient environment
with 47 decibels of noise if I was using
this card for gaming personally I would
overclock it and then make a custom fan
profile that ramped up to 60% in the 60
to 80 degree range though 80% fan speeds
did get significant amount more noise
did drop the temperatures by 5 degrees
and then a hundred percent fan speeds
got the best temperatures but the fan
speeds were simply unbearable to listen
to in 24/7 operation auto fan speeds
leveled out 53% though the temperatures
were significantly higher than that of
60%
so the 1.28 kilogram cooler that they've
included on the 2080 Super is doing a
phenomenal job and it does keep things
well under control
looking at the cooler itself however in
the design of the card measures in about
270 ml by 39 millimeters tall and about
a hundred and 13 millimeters thick on
the back of the card you've got three
display outs a USB type-c and also HDMI
2.0 out as for LED billing the GeForce
r-tx logo lights up green and you can
turn that off within the NVIDIA GeForce
experience if you wish to the card also
features a backplate that has the r-tx
2080 Super branding on it and then on
the front you get a mirrored finish with
that RTX 2080 Super branding - and this
card requires a six plus eight pin PCIe
connectors so now getting all that out
of the way leaves us at conclusion time
with the r-tx 2080 super now I'm gonna
be quite frank with you guys straight up
at this price range seven hundred US
dollars I wasn't a big fan of the r-tx
28 II originally nor was I a fan of the
Radeon 7 when that was released and I
think the 5700 XT sort of makes the
Radeon 7 obsolete and then the 2070
super at $500 does give more value for
money and I think the 2080 Super it's
stuck in that bracket of trying to be a
flagship card but it still falls behind
the 2080 TI by quite a bit so if you're
getting into real high-end gaming you
Mo's to consider the 2080 ti but there
is one saving grace for this card and
that is the overclocked performance does
perform quite well and if you're a 1440p
gamer and you wish to overclock which
the coolers are more than capable of
handling on this series of card then you
can get pretty good performance for
1440p high refresh game
that would be where I personally feel
this card suits someone best though as
we said in the intro this is the odd one
out of the supergroup whether 2070 Suber
is actually based off of a cut-down 2080
and the 2060 sukkah is based off of a
cut-down 2070 and all three super cards
have eight gigabytes of gddr5
is a tough one for the 2080 supe but it
will do a good job for 1440p high in
gaming but me personally I'd probably be
going with a 2070 super if I was in this
price range of the market of course what
about the 5700 XT versus the 2070 super
I'll save that for another video for you
guys before we get on out of here the
things that I do like about the RT X
series is the new envy encoder which
also expands to the 1660 and gtx 660ti
Turing cards for some reason they didn't
include it on the 1650 but it does a
phenomenal job if you wish to get into
streaming and not weigh down your CPU as
the image quality coming out of that is
really good I'll pull up a comparison
for you guys and if you also want to use
this for desktop recording in shadow
play then you will still be using that
MV encoder and getting better quality
than the previous generations and also
better quality than the AMD counterparts
as for the dl SS features I don't find
them too appealing at this point in time
though the ray-tracing can be impressive
though again if you're buying this card
for ray-tracing
the 28 ET i does provide a lot more
ray-tracing performance and even then by
the time the next generation cards are
out I'd say that's when the ray-tracing
performance would have been more
polished and you could expect even yet
more performance out of ray-tracing in
those next-generation cards the last
feature i do like about the Nvidia cards
is the game filter which enables you to
get a real different look in a game if
you wish to or of course if you're color
blind you can change colors on the spot
without having to rely on that game
engine having support for colorblind
features for example and so in a
nutshell with the r-tx 2080 Super it's
replacing the 2080 which I thought was a
mediocre graphics card and if you get
this card you definitely want to
overclock it it does come in at a weird
price point where it's sort of
struggling to compete with the 2080 Ti
and it doesn't offer as much value as
the 2070 Super in terms of the 2070
Super and the 5700 XT they'd be my
choices for someone who
wants to get into high-end gaming but
doesn't want to break the bank at this
point in time but keep in mind it does
still have a gigabytes of vram so if you
want to step it up to 4k how much life
left you have at that resolution is
pretty much anyone's guess you guys with
that aside I hope you enjoyed today's
review if you did then be sure to hit
that like button for us and also let us
know in the comment section below what
you think of the r-tx 20/80 super do you
share the same thoughts as me do you
think differently love reading your
thoughts and opinions as always and with
that aside I'll catch you in a nother
tech video very soon peace out for now
