everywhere it's in RAM it's in
motherboards it's even in SSDs now to
the point where some SSDs have so many
LEDs it can cause heating problems but
that aside there's been a rumor in the
industry and that is that having RGB on
your PC can boost your FPS but I was
talking to my good friend rocketjump
ninja who was telling me when he was
doing some benchmarking numbers that he
had some RGB software on and when he
turned it off he got a slight increase
in performance so he asked me to put
things to the test and see if the
contrary is true and that is could RGB
be affecting your performance let's find
out here today with not only just my 18
core this is the 79 80 XC which has
three different sets of RGB software
first of all the Corsair IQ and then
it's got the azuz or a sink and also the
galaxy extreme for controlling the
graphics card and then we've got my
travel PC the yes mini and if you guys
haven't seen that builder put the link
up here that is an absolute beast 9900
kHz 390 32 gigabytes of RAM and a
suitcase handle to boot so you can carry
this thing around anywhere but it's also
got to light loop 120 millimeter RGB
fans installed and I use a corsair
keyboard mouse and headset which all are
controlled through the IQ so with that
aside let the testing begin
so our first super scientific test is to
pull up task manager and just monitor
what's going on with the IQ open this is
my little yes mini PC right here and as
we said in the intro it's running a
ninety nine hundred K and this goes up
to four point eight gigahertz in its
current configuration but the five
different states we're monitoring with
task manager is the IQ closed the IQ
open with no affects running the rainbow
cycle just the all LED synched and then
rainbow wave all LEDs animated and then
the last is rainbow wave animated plus a
temp census overlay and this is where
the results got pretty interesting
because we saw idle CPU percent
utilization at about one point six
percent on average and that went all the
way up to eight point one percent with
the two layers with IQ open so first of
all over a five percent increase in CPU
utilization especially on a ninety nine
hundred K probably seems scary at first
but this is an idle CPU and so when we
seeing those percentages go up it's not
that bad what we do have to worry about
is ultimately the performance figures so
with that aside let's run Cinebench and
then after that we'll be going into a
CPU strenous game csgo and getting you
guys some solid numbers so after
completing the Cinebench our twenty
results we can see here that going from
our best-case scenario that's having IQ
closed we've got on average four
thousand seven hundred and thirty three
points and now we did run these tests
quite a few times to weed out variants
and we did see a consistent trend here
and that is from the best case scenario
four thousand seven hundred thirty three
points we did see it slightly go down
and then when the temp sensors were
turned on we then saw a drop of over
fifty points from the previous state and
that was the rainbow wave all LEDs
animated so basically the best-case
scenario to the worst case scenario was
a difference of one point six five
percent roughly in CPU performance so
Cinebench didn't really show much of a
difference but csgo this is my favorite
test of all because
it does weed out a lot of different
factors that even to this date it is a
phenomenal game for testing minor
differences as well as big differences
and what we saw here with IQ off we had
521 average FPS we also had the highest
maximum FPS draw but going down all the
way to the rainbow effects coupled with
the temp sensors on we saw an average
FPS of 453 this is a drop of over 13% so
what we can see coming out of this in
csgo
is that there is a sizeable difference
and that can affect your gameplay
basically if you're a competitive gamer
it is advised to turn off everything
before you get into a competitive match
so that was the yes mini the travel PC
we just tested out the IQ software but
now we're going to go over to the main
rig which can have the ability to pump
three different sets of RGB software
through it and let's start off now with
Cinebench our 20 so starting off here
we've got it clocked at 4.3 gigahertz on
18 cores with 64 gigabytes of memory and
what I had for this test was three
different sets here the azuz aura sync
actually gave us a one-point boost over
the nothing open so basically the aura
sync once you've set your settings in it
doesn't then affect your CPU performance
whatsoever the gallic software showed a
similar trend as well really just
dialing in those settings to a chip on
board the actual graphics card itself
and then that remembers the RGB and you
don't have to have the software open and
even if you do have it open it's not
polling your CPU and the next up we're
moving on to IQ and what we had here was
the rainbow effect as well as the temp
sensor so two different layers and that
is temp sensors which are polling the
CPU and we saw a dip here in Cinebench
our 20 going from around the 9600 point
down to the low 9500 so not much of a
difference really to write home about
especially on the 18 core but having all
these different software open at the
same time then showed us a drop of an
additional 50 points so it wasn't making
a whole lot of difference in the
Cinebench r20 run
but what about the csgo minimum settings
720p benchmark so csgo on the 18 core 36
threaded 79 80 XE was actually really
interesting because I didn't know but
this game uses up to 28 threads maximum
depending on the part of the game you're
in and we only really noticed this by
pulling up task manager and then
actively monitoring when the game was
running a benchmark and we could then
manually count all the threads and so
this is why I think on the 9900 K with
its 16 threads this was where
performance got affected as opposed to
the 36 threaded option which still had
an additional 8 threads left over doing
nothing while this benchmark was running
and so we're gonna pull up the numbers
anyway but we can see here that it
pretty much didn't make any difference
when it came to having all three
different sets of software open
individually or having them all three at
the same time open where we got the
worst case scenario of 545 average FPS
and then the best case scenario with all
the software off of 552 well actually
having the azouz or a sync open gave us
one extra fps and all the rest of the
results here were showing a similar
trend in that it didn't make a
difference because we had the spare
performance left over so it does tell
you something about how in the case of
the IQ and the temp census how this
software is actually working and that is
we saw the biggest drop when we had the
temp sensor setting open and so what
that is doing is it's essentially
polling your hardware to the point where
that can affect your CPU performance and
of course it can affect your CPU when it
comes to playing games but as we saw
with the 79 80 XE because we've got a
lot of headroom left over in a game like
csgo and I imagine pretty much every
single game out there is not going to be
using 36 threads for quite some time we
can see that this game it didn't make a
difference at all because the IQ and all
the other RGB software is being
mitigated to those spare CPU cores and
threads
and so it's not going to affect your
performance if you've got a bigger
system with more power to spare also on
the flip side in case of the 9900 kay if
a game doesn't use up to 16 threads and
for instance it uses maybe 8 threads and
you've got IQ or other RGB software open
then it's not going to make a difference
either so it does utilize available
resources without affecting FPS if that
game doesn't then utilize all those
resources so it's a little bit of a
weird thing but basically if the game
does utilize all the cores and threads
that your CPU offers and you do have
things like IQ open or lastly if you are
streaming and you're using your CPU to
encode or of course you just want the
best FPS possible then it would be
well-advised to turn off that RGB
software before you get into gaming but
lastly the most interesting thing that
we learned was things like the aura sync
software and also the gal acts which
have your pre-programmed settings which
essentially save it to a different chip
they didn't affect performance but also
they didn't have the customization
available that IQ has but ultimately the
trade-off for that customization with IQ
and also belief raises software since it
does follow the footsteps of IQ is that
it can affect your CPU performance and
ultimately if you're playing games it
can affect your FPS so a little
suggestion in the future maybe is if
they have for instance a node controller
anyway guys that is enough RGB for me
for one day if you guys enjoyed today's
video then you know to do hit that like
button also let us know in the comments
section below what you think of RGB and
also all the customization and RGB
software do you think the trade-off is
worth it honestly with all the light
loop going on here I do like the effects
and things that this gives me and of
course I do have the 18 core 36 threads
so it really doesn't affect me
whatsoever but of course the less caused
and threads you have the more this
software can
fact your performance and ultimately
your FPS in games so that was a bit of a
negative to see coming out of this but
every guys I hope that answers a few
questions especially rocketjump ninja
who had a request for this video and
I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
