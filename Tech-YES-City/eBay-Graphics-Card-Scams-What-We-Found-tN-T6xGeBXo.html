these you may have even been suckered
into buying one
brace yourselves ladies and gentlemen
for some of the scams you're about to
see may look right on the surface but
deep down is where the truth lies we're
looking at a bait I'll Express and even
local sellers trying to scam people
we've even got a few right here in the
tackiest studio to see just how bad they
are
welcome back to tech yes City before we
get on to the scam gravis cards just
gonna go through some tips and tricks on
how to make sure you're not getting
played by a scammer
however the sad thing is about these two
gravis cards I have here is that one of
them was in a trade-in and one of them
was donated by a viewer though the first
point is read the description thoroughly
it may clearly state one item in the
title but some cheeky scammers will
actually tell you what the card really
is to avoid the trouble this 1050
actually says it is a 1050 style
replacement board for a 750ti then goes
on to downgrade it further and says it
ships with a GTX 650 Ti to put that into
perspective the firestrike score of a
1050 is 6660 points by contrast the
score of the 650 Ti is three thousand
four hundred and thirty points that's
clearly half the score and pretty much
with 3d mark flash drag especially on
the low-end half a score is going to
translate into half the performance
especially when it comes to video games
and the sad thing is about that is that
also you've got the older architecture
for instance the 650 TI I believe it
doesn't even support a shadow play so
you can't even capture any of your
gameplay footage and on a 1050 you could
otherwise capture some gameplay footage
which is important if your video editing
or you want to get into streaming or you
just want to try out some different
things you're going to buy that card
thinking you have that option then
suddenly find out that you got played
and also on top of that since the 650 Ti
is a much older architecture it's much
less efficient than the 1050 is so off
the top of my head you'll be using up
roughly the same amount of power yet
you'll be getting half the performance
however using this same listing as an
example my second tip would be to make
sure the advertised card has the same
certifications as the card it's
pretending to be main points being the
amount of video memory whether it be 2
gigabytes 3 gigabytes 4 gigabytes etc
and what type that is say for instance
GDR 3 gddr5 5x or 6 and what they list
the architecture or process like this
1050 knockoff is supposed to be 16
nanometer but it is listed as 28
furthermore if you're still on the fence
about whether this grabs card is legit
or not you can also look at the core
clock speeds and see with the one that's
being advertised matches up with the one
that you wish to buy for instance the
GTX 780 saying it's got 500 megahertz
when we know if we go to video spec page
that the GTX 780 has much higher core
clocks than this going that of close to
900 megahertz out of the box also the
memory bus seems to be different a lot
of the times for instance on a GTX 780
the memory bus is well over 300 bits but
when we look on this gravis card it's
saying it's under 200 so there's some
clear alarm bells ringing when it comes
to looking at these cards now of course
the last telltale sign is that the fact
that this gravis card is manufactured
from a brand you've never heard before
it'll most likely have some fake Nvidia
stickers on it and then have a cooler
that just looks cheap and you've never
seen that cooler implemented on any
major broad partners graphics cards in
the past so what happens if you do buy a
card and it's not what they say it is
they say that they have the warranty
service and the Monday to Saturday
customer service so let's look for a
number let's just google new frog and
what is this is this an Aliexpress
knockoff really on site Jabba 28 out of
31 positive reviews were posted on the
exact same day not suspicious at all but
along with those 37 five-star reviews
there were 37 one-star reviews with
tragic stories of orders never shipping
items different to the pictures and it
keeps going on and on trust pile the 57
percent positive rating from all people
who have only done one review new frog
boys and girls we've found a monster and
the saddest thing is I'm positive that's
not the only example out there but one
thing that you can double down on with
the sadness is that when there is a
product and there is a market for it and
there's already scams that exist you can
be rest assured that there's going to be
more scams in the future I think rest
assured was the wrong term but but I
don't want you guys to stress about it
I'm here to help though perhaps one of
these cards is already in the mail it's
too late or you know a friend who's
one or you know someone who doesn't know
much about tech and they've been
suckered into buying one what happens if
you do come into one of these cards well
what I've got right here is a GTX 780
that's decided to have a throwback on
the cooler that I've never seen before
on a 780 and also ditched the six plus
eight pin power in favor of a single
molex on a GTX 780 but let's have some
fun with this card bench market and see
what it actually is trying to boot fire
strike we could see here that we
couldn't even load it up there wasn't
enough vram available and then moving on
to maybe fortnight something very
popular something that's very easy to
play can play this on pretty much a
potato at least in modern day standards
and this game wouldn't even boot either
just saying it's not even dx11
compatible so we had a card that was
fairly old to say the least
and now I couldn't really find much
about it without pulling it apart and
when we did pull it apart we found out
that this gtx 780 is actually a GTS 250
or at least it looks very similar to it
so that is a big hosing and the
difference here between a gtx 780 and at
GTS 250 is mammoths we can't even boot
up games on one GPU on another graphics
card we're going to be having a great
experience at full HD pretty much maxing
a lot of games even in 2018 so there's
pretty much the worst case scenario if I
actually paid money for this I would be
livid and the good thing is at least if
you buy things like this on eBay if you
buy it off I'll Express you will be
covered so if you do get hosed then you
can get your money back a lot of the
times on returns
however the saddest thing is there'd be
a lot of people out there who just
aren't aware of these gravis cards and
that they're being faked because some of
the times especially in the case of a
GTX 650 TI versus a 1050 you may just
install that gravis card it plays
fortnight and it will actually play it
ok and so nonetheless you don't have
noticed the difference if you weren't a
tech enthusiast
so naturally the Lowell that priced the
gravis card to begin with on the retail
shelves the less likely you're going to
get people trying to scan
but once you start moving into the
mid-range I think this is the sweet spot
for the scammers we can say that they
like to implement cheap coolers and
since those gravis cards are still
pretty powerful but they don't use up a
whole lot of power you will start to see
scammers trying to take advantage of
innocent people and that's why I'm here
to give you this video here today to try
and protect you also on the website tax
City TV just like the fire strike
benchmark scores we made a site for that
so you can easily check scores on the
fly and see if you're getting what you
paid for we will be making a list of all
the knowing scammers graphics cards out

if you want to check and see if
something is possibly a scam we'll have
that ready for you in due time the link
