is the dark coming back to you guys
today with a question that I get asked a
lot lately and that is should i wait for
broadwell or should I just pull the
trigger now and go get a haswell cpu on
a gaming rig and we're gonna do this
over some heroes new earth gameplay as I
love this game it's a lot of fun and
ultimately this is done with shadow play
as well but anyway let's get on with the
topic the quick and dirty answer in is
no but I'm going to elaborate on that
and we're going to talk about what
essentially is Broadwell broadwell is
Intel's newest 14 nanometer die shrink
it's essentially the tick in there
tick-tock strategy now until themselves
has said look we've got a strategy every
two years we're going to tick-tock
strategy where one year we release a die
shrink the next year we release a
architectural improvement and for me I'm
more keen I'm always keen to see what
the talk has because that's when you get
the architectural improvement that's
when you in my opinion can sometimes get
a big performance increase as people saw
with Sandy Bridge that was probably
their best talk to date as well was not
that impressive I thought has women in
some instances it was actually slower
than Ivy Bridge like for rendering and
stuff but definitely when they doubled
the case bandwidth that did help and I
did find it did make an improvement for
gaming so above all else it made an
improvement for gaming so i can
recommend has well over IV if you're a
gamer and so essentially what you've got
now is another thing to that when you
went from IV to has well you had such
really good motherboards i'm in the z87
platform line i mean the motherboard
partners really stepped it up and they
offered just everything that gamers want
it on these on these on these platforms
I mean they put all sort of three ports
on there they put good anti-seize on
board they put really good onboard audio
on board and people were just like damn
you z87 motherboards especially on a you
know mid-range board come feature-packed
and the good thing about the Haswell
cpus and the IV cpus is that on a
mid-range board you on air you didn't
need any better than a mid-range board
to sort of get that max
of a clock out of your CPU so I think
there's the 87 board as well and this is
another reason why I'm not really going
to be recommending the waiting for
broadwell is because the z87 board is
already really feature packed I don't
see them adding much else the rumors are
that the z97 platform is going to bring
in a PCI Express SSD and hard drive
support which will increase the
bandwidth up to one gigabyte per second
if you guys didn't know the side of
three is currently maxed out at six
gigabits per second which is essentially
different 2 gigabytes if you were to put
that in gigabyte terms it be like point
6 gigabytes per second so you can see
that you're going to get a bit of an
upgrade this would generally be for
people who are really enthusiast minded
in that they want to raid 2 SSDs
together and get an apparent unit get
higher transfer speeds out of their raid
zeros for instance to samsung pros 8 40
s in this configuration would be beast
so if you are that kind of person you'll
probably be upgrading anyway but just
for the general gamer on say a gtx 780
or a 780ti and a 467 tkr 477 TK and just
like a 256gb SSD you generally not going
to notice much of a difference in my
opinion now another feature they're
going to offer is until boot guard or
something technology which i really i
mean i think that's more of a server
sort of feature i don't i'm not going to
be using that I generally have no
problems with my my data getting
compromised there on my computer being
compromised in any way so there's the
two new features coming out and they're
not really that sort of Wow in my
opinion so the z97 platformer mean am I
going to be upgrading probably because I
make a lot of videos and you know I get
some advertising cash out of their
videos and it pretty much pays for
itself so but honestly all's we're going
to see this time is the tech and so
we're going from 22 nanometer to 14
nanometer and with that you're going to
get about i'm gonna guess maybe a seven
percent improvement
sort of in performance per clock and
proven performance per cycle internal
what is the IPC improvement so you're
going to get about a seven percent
increase in my opinion and the reason
why it's going to be more than five
percent is because we go from 22 to 14
and if you look at that in percentage
drops i think it's about thirty-six
percent that this is actually going to
drop last time it went from 32 to 22
that was about thirty one percent in the
actual size so it's actually pretty damn
big like so thirty-six percent drop in
die size is actually pretty damn big so
i think the actual the IPC improvements
going to be pretty decent but is it
worth waiting out you know when's this
chip going to be coming out and i
honestly think it's going to be coming
out in december rumors i was going to be
coming out december and i agree i think
until if you guys in 0 rd that lower
like the small of these chips go the the
more expensive rd gets i mean these
things like until have to fork out an
absolute load of cash for rd so
it's in their best interests to delay
these chips as much as they can that's
just my opinion on it so this is our
mean AMD really not bringing any
anything to the table so until aren't
really getting pressured to bring these
chips of the market as soon as they can
so i think you're going to see the
tick-tock strategy is going to be more
like a 2.9 year cycle now because I mean
Ivy Bridge was already delayed under
over bridge wasn't delayed sorry it was
has walled it was delayed three months
past its expected date and I think
they're gonna push this one another
three months and so expect to see I mean
you guys can expect to see something
like yeah December that looks pretty
solid in my opinion December late
December 2014 so I think that's when
broadwell is going to come out I mean it
could come out a bit earlier but the
fact that Intel hasn't confirmed any
release dates already is a fact I think
in my opinion that we're not going to
get it soon
that's just something to sort of be
mindful of so if you know what is it now
it's March so do you want to honestly
wait another eight months nine months
for a CPU I don't think it's worth it i
mean considering already considering
that Haswell chips I already can't come
down in price from their initial release
price I mean they come at they're going
out for about two hundred dollars now or
two hundred nine dollars if you're in
the states I mean I picked mine up for
about 240 I believe I actually forgot
I'm it might have been cheaper to 20 but
definitely the motherboards and the z87
sort of the motherboards and the cpu
user definitely at a decent price at the
moment so you can pick one up and you
and the good thing is that this time
around two if you're really desperate to
get broad well you can I'm pretty sure
you're going to be able to use the z87
platform to use broad well I mean it's
going to be the same socket it's going
to be the LGA 1150 so that's going to be
no problems at all I mean if they did
make it z97 only than damn and i really
like i would probably write and go to an
intel building and go what the hell you
would release one motherboard for one
cpu only that's just disgraceful but I
mean I think yeah I think you're
definitely going to be able to use your
z87 platform with broad well so I don't
think that's going to be a problem just
a bios update and you're good to go so
definitely yes so I mean if you want to
wait if you definitely want to get on
broad well then I don't think you can
have a problem with the z87 motherboard
so that's one thing to remember now
another reason why I believe how me
sorry Broadwell is going to be delayed
is until need time to get haswell-e out
I mean if they're releasing broadwell
before Haswell ease out then they know
that that's costing themselves market
share right i mean this is this is a
sort of they've sort of i think that's
sort of competing with themselves
because people will go out and they'll
get the 57 70 k and if it's released
before haswell-e they've just
essentially you know instead of trying
to sell an eight-core they've
essentially just costs themselves maybe
$400 whatever because they can't sell a
house Wally chip now because that guy's
on the leads Broadwell so I think
they're going to let haswell-e come out
before broadwell this time I think
that's in how to in Intel's best
interest as a company so be interesting
to see but yeah that's that so anyways I
hope you enjoyed this I mean honestly I
personally if I was building a gaming pc
today I wouldn't wait out you know but
at the end of the year I mean if you're
on it like say a decent gaming pc at the
moment like gtx 580 or say a 69 50 or
something like that then maybe i would
wait out because maxwell will be coming
out around the same time as Broadwell so
that that's probably the only person i
would recommend waiting out if you were
in that position where you're like look
I only upgrade every three years or so
three or four years and I've already got
a pretty decent gaming rig I would
probably wait out for Broadwell and
Maxwell together because that'll pack a
punch so that's just my opinion for you
guys and yeah hope you enjoyed it if you
have any questions please let me know in
the comment section below and I'll be
coming back to you guys soon sorry I'm
gonna talk about a few other things
quickly and that is audio I'm sorry but
I've just got a heap of audio gear to
test and I'm just gonna get through it
all and then I'm gonna slash quit audio
because i'm kind of bored I'm over it
I'm really not an audio enthusiast and
just you know like good audio but you
know I don't wake up in the morning
going on damn i want to listen to music
i wake up in the morning going down on
play video games eat some good food and
you know that's me or drive drive a car
sir now that they're my two passions is
cars and video games but you know yet so
i'm going to be getting these audio
videos done i'm sorry but you just want
to get it through it and there's / quit
it and we won't come back to audio again
and also yeah the titanium HD speaking
of audio i'm actually recording on it
now so let me know what you guys think
if the audio is better if it's richer
i'm not too sure but i'm recording on a
new ADC essentially
through the same preamp in the same Mike
so let me know what you guys think and I
can't wait to give you guys more videos
anyway if you like this video please
give me a please give me a thumbs up
greatly appreciate it and if you haven't
really subscribe to take your city and
I'll become about to you guys soon so
yeah essentially if you are waiting if
you have a decent gaming rig already and
you want to wait for a broad well sort
of broad well maxwell combo then i
probably would wait out but if you are
if you have a really bad gaming pc or
you don't have a gaming pc at all then
it's going to be like a nine-month wait
so I probably wouldn't wait personally
so that's that guys and I'll peace out
for now see you later bait</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
