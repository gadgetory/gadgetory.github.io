2014 and we are going to use an impeller
ambien in Powell so I promised you guys
I would change up the budget bills and
this is exactly what I'm going to do I'm
gonna put the links for the US the UK
and Australia all in the description
below however I will be describing the
build in the u.s. link now this is
pretty much I mean all the links are
pretty similar they're just got
different brands for the different areas
which I believe offer the best value for
money so let me know what you guys think
about this new format it'll definitely
save a few videos you can watch one
video and know that you're in this
country you can get these deals kind of
thing however let's move on with the
budget build and I'll explain what parts
are in the cart and how they perform so
here's the US PC part pick a link for
you guys and the first part in the cart
is the Intel 32:58 now I've got it right
here
I have used this CPU and I have used it
in a gaming rig with the GTX 760 now it
performed really well it overclocks to
4.2 gigs on the stock heatsink fan as
well on a budget motherboard so you're
getting basically what this means is
that you can get free performance for
nothing when you buy this CPU and you
couple it with a budget motherboard like
the motherboard we are putting in the
description or in the pipe in the PC
popping a link today so great CPU for
the money it runs cool it uses like next
to no power you've also got the onboard
graphics there which you can use for
streaming with the Intel Quick Sync so
the benefits of this CPU for $70 are
just extremely good I mean if you live
in your Micro Center as well you can
pick it up for $60 as well so extremely
good value for money with this CPU now
there is a there is a catch with this
CPU though a lot of people say may not
like I had one person that should be
saying I'll getting a bad experience
with the GTX 770 and that's exactly that
I would only recommend the CPU up until
a GTX 760 now I have tested the 3220
with the GTX 780 lightning overclocked
and the experience was horrible the CPU
was just choking so yeah
know your limits with this CPU but it is
good up until the GTX 760 after that it
starts to sort of have a rough time
especially at 1080p now let's move on to
the next part of the build
this is the gigabyte be 85m d2v
motherboard now I have the ds3 H they're
similar I think they've just got
different video outputs on the
motherboard which doesn't even matter
because we're going to be using them a
graphics card which we're going to use
the outputs from that graphics card so
the difference between the ds3 H and the
DTV is nothing if you're a gamer so
don't worry about that now this
motherboard let's have a look at it it's
$49 after you get a $10 mail-in rebate
and for that price it's really good
value for money so I've tested this
motherboard it runs cool at overclocked
swell it over clocks until 1.2 volt
which should be good for most most of
these Haswell CPUs when these penny amps
up until about four point two gigs you
might only be able to get 4.1 but you're
still going to get a decent overclock
and you'll know that this thing will
just handle games for the next year two
years or however long you throw at it
now another thing about this build is
you also have upgrade ability that's
right
you're getting a budget and motherboard
like the B 85 M for $50 and then in the
future you can take this penny amount
this 32:58 you can sell it maybe $40 $50
in a couple years time drop in a 4770k
or a for 790 k and you'll have a fork or
eight threaded beast in there and you'll
be ready to play games with only a
minimal upgrade so you've got upgrade
ability there and it's really good I
like the fact that this this board gives
you options as well which is kind of
hard when we're in a budget build range
so let's get on the next part of
building that is 8 gigabytes of ddr3
memory now if you are on a budget you
can go with just one 4 gigabyte stick
however I do recommend you get a
gigabytes for the best experience I mean
especially we're gonna make videos or
multitask or do a little bit of this and
that then a gigabytes is desired over 4
it is expensive though I know $73 fakey
but it's quite expensive
however wait till you go see the prices
of ddr4 Ram and you will go
yourself now so we got team Xtreme here
this stuff will be able to be
overclocked to 1600 megahertz so that's
the max that the b85 and will support so
you can pretty much just whack in the
XMP profiles in the BIOS and you're good
to go with this Ram now let's move on to
the next part of the build now this is
optional so the optional stuff here I
have pretty much mark I've just put it
down to 0 dolls so if you have the extra
money you can delete the
caviar blue one terabyte and go with a
240 GB SSD which I think it's like $90
or something like that so yeah $10
million rebates $99 so great value for
money there it's an extra 42 dollars
over one terabyte though if you only
have one drive then I do recommend
getting a hard disk drive as you get a
lot of storage for your money but if you
have a backup drive sitting around home
like 2 terabyte your dad has a 2
terabyte or your brother or whatnot your
girlfriend has a 2 terabyte backup drive
just use that to backup your files and
get an SSD because you will notice the
difference
so anyway that without with that being
said let's move on down to the Western
Digital one terabyte blue so this is
just a $58 drive it's pretty much a
staple in any budget low budget gaming
regal mid budget gaming rig that you'll
see out there because it's just they're
just reliable drives I mean where I work
we have hundreds of these drives and
they don't fail they just keep going I
love Western Digital drives anyway most
move on to the next pilot built and that
is the Zeus gtx 750ti
now I told you guys that I have tested
this whole rig and yes I've tested a gtx
750ti and it's great value for money it
uses little to no power it runs so cool
as well so if you're one of those guys
who doesn't clean out his computer just
lets dust build up this thing won't
throttle at all this thing here
overclocked like a beast and it still
ran so cool in the dead heat of summer
so the 750 Ti is there legit graphics
cards I really like the price point
they're at as well especially you can
get this thing for a hundred and thirty
dollars after a rebate I mean come on
that's really cheap so it's also a
cool-looking car the Zeus make a cool
looking cooler so you'll be able to have
some irrespective as well from your
friends whatnot and yeah I like this
card so it probably most likely these
cards like I guarantee you this thing
will overclock to like 1.2 gigs as well
if you want to overclock it which is
really good this one here overclocked to
like 1.3 and I didn't even do anything I
didn't even touch a button so that 750
gr is legit if you have the extra money
you can go with the GTX 760 I've got one
of those right here so you can go with
the GTX 760 if you've got the extra
money or you can go with an r9 to a 270
270 X
so online 280 might be starting to sort
of creep into that level of doesn't work
too well with the pen in 32:58 but
definitely if you've got the money you
can get the 270 X or the 760 as well but
750 GI for the money is still great
value for money I really like this
graphics card so it's up to you guys
what you want to do but awesome graphics
card you'll be having a great experience
at 1080p regardless now let's look at
the next buy the build this is the NZXT
210 source 210 now this case I mean 30
dollars after $10 mail-in rebate wow
it's got a window like you've got a
window on it as well so it's a
good-looking case I hardly ever come
into cases that look this good for $30
it looks sleek it looks clean and I mean
it comes to the fan it comes with the
power button like I've got to stress
this in every budget build man you're
getting a power button that's what you
need now but on a serious note the gtx
750ti it's not a long graphics card so
this you'll have no problems fitting
this graphics card in this case as the
full it's also fits normal ATX
motherboards in there but work since
we're using a micro ATX motherboard
we'll have no problems with the
compatibility everything will fit in
fine the case will look good and that's
all that we need to know so yeah next
pile the build and a max triathlon 750 a
650 watt power supply wow this thing is
based man it's also semi modular as well
so you can actually have a very clean
looking PC when you get this power
supply not only that you get a $30.00
mail-in rebate I mean assuming I'm
assuming that you can get this rebate
and if you can then it really marks
extraordinary value for money I mean $46
after that rebate for a 650 watt from
Animax I mean look at that two 12-volt
rails that I'm pretty sure I mean yeah
they did combine and say the max output
even if they combined would be about 50
amps just from memory maybe 55 amps but
you've still got huge amount of answer
in the 12 volt rail this is the thing
about this power supply seriously don't
save $20 and go with the 430 CX
whatever because this thing will give
you upgrade ability this thing will
allow you to put a beast grants card in
in the future better CPU like a fork or
eight threaded CPU overclock it over
clip the GPU and you'll still have no
problems not to mention it'll last long
as well
Wow okay grab this power supply if you
can get that mail in rebate because it's
awesome value for money and now leave
Lex next part of the build here is
simply all's I have done is I have
blacked it out to $0 if you need a DVD
writer then get one for maybe I think
$12 $15 if you don't need one then don't
bother if you've got an external sitting
around at home or you can install
Windows from the USB pen then that's
cool as well
so that brings the grand total to four
hundred and fifty dollars after mail-in
rebates I mean before mail-in rebates is
gonna cost you five hundred fifteen
dollars but this PC is quite simply
going to be amazing for the money you've
got upgradability there you've got
playability there as well as your
favorite games at 1080p and you've also
got some power savings I mean you've got
sympathy to you and they're gonna save
power - core dual core it's gonna save
power I mean this thing's gonna be beast
anyway hope you guys enjoyed this budget
build for 2014 September if you did
please give a thumbs up if you have any
questions about this budget bill please
leave a comment in the comment section
below and I'll catch you guys soon with
another tech video I've also put the
links in here for the different
countries for Australia main stray is
actually pretty impressive 585 dollars
AUD for this same build and the UK is
also pretty similar as well another
thing I should mention is yeah the CPU
cooler if you want to get a CPU cooler
as well go grab yourself like cool
master 212 Evo and you're good to go
because then you can use that cooler on
your future CPU as well if you get a
4:17 UK and drop it in anyway I've
talked enough I'll see you guys in
another tech video if you haven't
already hit the like button hit the
subscribe button yeah baby
peace out bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
