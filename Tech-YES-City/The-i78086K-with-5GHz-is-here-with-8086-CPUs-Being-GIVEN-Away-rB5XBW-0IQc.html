101 and I'm at the gigabyte booth for
the new launch of the 808 6k a 40th year
anniversary cpu from Intel which goes to
all core 5 gigahertz out of the box of
course that's dependent on your
motherboard the vrm the cooling and
especially on the CPU itself so for
pricing we're looking around 399 and it
will be available very soon hitting the
streets though to celebrate this Intel's
giving away exactly the amount of the
processor model itself 8086 of these
will be available in a sweepstakes
giveaway so put the link in the
description below if you want a chance
to win one but it's only up for another
12 hours so you do have to be quick if
you want to get in with a chance to win
one of these CPUs but also on display
here we have from gigabyte some of their
motherboards some of them just come out
with some new technologies and we're
gonna see what's hot and what's not
welcome back to tech issah dean here we
have the 8086 now I did get a hands on
before on the showroom floor with this
and it was so easy to get to five
gigahertz very fast CPU pretty much the
best in slot at the moment with six
cores 12 threads and there's no eight
cores e 370 announced quite yet so this
seems to be the one that a lot of people
want to go to on the intel side of
things and also from gigabyte stack they
now have obtain memory built in on three
different SKUs of their motherboards the
z 370 gaming 7o p the ultra gaming Wi-Fi
o p and also the ultra gaming 2.0 oak
piece of the o p is that extension on
the motherboards which means that there
will be some obtain memory baked into
the motherboard so you don't have to go
out and purchase that independently if
you want to use that technology so now
some other awesome features coming out
from Oris and gigabyte is also the turbo
b clock which is a dedicated clock
generated separate from the CPU itself
giving you more flexibility in terms of
overclocking traditionally like the base
clock used to be
however touching the base clock on a
simple motherboard will make sure that
your USB and your SSD and all that gets
overclocked so it's really pointless to
go with the host clock higher than 100
but if you do that with a turbo bit
clock you've now got more flexibility on
RAM and CPU so you can just edge out
that extra 20 megahertz for example if
you need to on the CPU side or in the
memory sight if you find a sweet spot
overclock on your memory to certain
voltage range you can help do that with
the turbo B clock now also on the gaming
7 o P there is now direct heat pipes
touching those MOSFETs to help cool
things down better than ever before so
gigabyte tell me now they're focusing on
going all-out and trying to be the best
so basically what that means is new and
improved aesthetics new and improved
cooling on the heatsink and also coming
very soon which is a very high priority
is to overhaul the BIOS and get that top
notch hey guys that about wraps it up
for the 8:08 6k a brand new CPU the
selected been the best of the best it is
the one you want to get if you are into
overclocking will have a slight premium
over the 8700 k however with that you
can expect yourself to be getting 5
gigahertz on all cores out of the box
however they still are using thermal
paste between the die and also the IHS
so you may wish to
this to get better performance there's
also some other coolers out there that
can now directly touch the die and get
incredible temperatures if that's what
you're into and also make sure you get
in with a chance to get one of these in
the giveaway it's really quick sweet
stakes are there I'm entering with the
chance I really want to win one of these
things and if you enjoyed today's videos
and be sure to hit that like button I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye
welcome back to tech yesterday here we
got the eighty eight eighty eighty eight
six eight welcome back to tech you're
sitting here we have the 8086 8086</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
