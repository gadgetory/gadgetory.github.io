gentlemen this is boring I'm going back
to you guys today with a tutorial on how
to make a bootable USB pendrive not just
that as well it's going to be a tutorial
on how to make a multi petition bootable
USB pendrive in Windows 8.1 now if you
guys don't know in Windows 8.1 Windows 8
and Windows 7 there's actually a
limitation in the OS where you can't
make more than one recognizable
partition on a removable media device
that is something such as a USB pendrive
though there is a sort of a trick to get
around this and that's what I'm going to
show you today because I'm sure there's
people out there who have like an 8
gigabyte USB pendrive 16 gig or even 32
gigabyte pendrive and they want to just
make a little segment for that boot
petition and then they want to use the
rest of their USB pendrive as a normal
USB pendrive where they can put data and
what not freely on it however if you
just have a 4 gigabyte USB pendrive and
you just want the petition session then
I'll put a link in the description below
where you can skip ahead on how to just
make a USB bootable pendrive but if you
guys are interested in making a multi
petition USB pendrive then let's
continue on so we're on our desktop here
and now there are three programs you
will want to get straightaway two
programs sorry that the first one being
you me and now there are other programs
you can use but I prefer you me it's
just so easy so like a few clicks and
you might be able to make that bootable
USB pendrive so you go click here
download download it wherever you want
to download it to and then you need
another program called boot ice and now
the 32-bit version is going to be
absolutely fine so we've got boot ice
one point three point two point one I'll
put the download link in the description
below for you guys so once you've got
those programs we can now go on the
desktop and get these things ready so
we've got here in English windows a
64-bit version a bootable ISO and this
is the ISO I currently use to install
Windows because I've only got Windows 8
keys and so I have to update to Windows
8.1 obviously if you're going to have
whatever I say you're going to have so
get that ISO on the desktop and get it
ready and then get you me and then get
this program called boot ice as well
and so with this blue dice program we
can now start to do the first steps in
making a multi petition USB pendrive so
we're going to go down to Windows here
and we can type in disk parts and this
will bring up this petition it's a
program that essentially can it's
actually a pretty powerful program but
it's what's going to do is going to
completely wipe our USB pendrive because
we're going to start from fresh here so
there's no confusions there's no
frustrations if you follow this tutorial
you'll have exactly what I'm trying to
do a tutorial for and that's a bootable
multi partition bootable USB pendrive
anyway in here we can this part we can
go to lists disk so this is the first
thing we type in type in list is press
enter it'll bring up all the disks
currently connected to our computer and
we can see here disc 3 we want to make
pay particular attention to disc 3 in my
on my behalf or in my part and that is
the that is my USB pendrive so you have
to make sure that you're selecting the
right disk so what we do is select disk
3 and so in this case disc three will
now be selected and just for
clarification
we can now go list disk again type it in
again and it should have a star next to
the disk that's selected so you want to
make sure that you are selecting the
right disk if you select the wrong disk
and you do what I'm doing you can
potentially break your whole computer so
this is crucial that you select the
right disk so now we've got the USB
pendrive selected we can now type in
clean and this will just essentially
just wipe the drive completely like it's
basically the most
thinner is just wiping the whole drive
clean and so now we've wiped this drive
clean we can now type create partition
primary so we want to just format it and
the basic I think it's a fat 16 of
formatted to base of the get-go so
anyway we go create partition primary
bang this part succeeded in creating it
the unspecified position so now our boot
drive is basically cleaned out it's
ready to go and we can now close this
program down and so we should be able to
I mean if you want to you can quickly go
to this PC on my computer and you can
see it there should be recognizable but
after this we want to open up the
program now boot ice
and so after we've opened up this
program this is actually a pretty good
program really good it's the only
program that I know it can do this so we
go open up this program go down to parts
manager this button here so we make sure
our dis is selected of course this is
our actual disks a USB flash drive here
and we go down to parts manage and now
once we've clicked on that we can go to
re partitioning here so don't worry
about formatting because repositioning
can format it as well it's going to
reformat it essentially as well so we go
to re partitioning and so after we
clicked on repositioning we can now go
down to USB HDD mode here down the
bottom multi partitions and we can
select that so it's originally selected
on single petition but we want to change
it to USB HDD mode multi partitions and
we're going to click OK and now what
this is going to do is it's going to
allow us the ability to make three
petitions up to three petitions with one
extended I believe so we want to click
on 0 0 straightaway and that will give
us more free space so on 3 &amp;amp; 2 we can
click 0 0 for now and now we want to
this will be fat32 write that 32 will be
our initial boot drive here and we want
to make this say three thousand seven
hundred and fifty megabytes you can make
it whatever you want you make it 4
thousand megabytes if you want to you
can make it six thousand megabytes you
can make it so just my file my ISO file
things like three point three five
gigabytes and whatnot so I'm just going
to make it three thousand seven hundred
fifty megabytes and then I'm going to
make the other petition three thousand
six hundred and thirty six megabytes so
I know when I insert it if it comes up
anything over three point six gig will
be the boot drive and anything under
that will be the actual data drive and
now we can put pretty much just a format
them in fat32 that's not too much of a
difference on a pendrive we also want to
click here optimize internal structure
now this is also another good thing that
we can click here and so we could leave
these other sector and you leave that
option alone and just click OK and
essentially what this will do and click
OK again as I said what this will do now
is it will format our Drive pendrive
into two different partitions both being
fat32
and now the important thing here this is
the this is sort of like the trick that
we're going to do with this program when
we want to use the data section of the
drive we can see it here now it's come
up as G Drive when we want to use the
data section of the G Drive we have to
click set accessible and so you're going
to want to keep basically in a nutshell
you're going to want to keep boot ice
this program you want to store it away
in your file somewhere and keep it on
hand because whenever you want to use it
as a data drive you can hit here set
accessible to that 3.6 gig petition this
is why I didn't set the capacity at the
same I know 3.7 gig is my boot petition
3.6 is my actual data petition and so if
we want to use it as a data petition to
put files on we can then click set
accessible if we want to use it as a
boot drive we can then click set
accessible reboot the computer and then
boot or whatever go to the computer that
you're going to install windows on and
use it like a normal USB pendrive sorry
normal USB bootable Drive then after
we're done we can go back and just
change it to this program to our so we
just have to whatever we're using it for
we have to switch it before we do it and
then after we're finished we can then
switch it back to whatever we want to do
it for that makes any sense so if you
want to use it as a boot drive okay this
is where the boot partition is we can
hit set accessible now we can use it as
a boot drive and if we want to use it as
a data storage device we can now go okay
three point six gigs okay there's no
Drive later coming up set accessible and
we can now use it as a data drive so
once we've done that so now that we're
going to continue the second part of the
tutorial we are going to set accessible
to 3.7 gig partition and make that
active so you can read it so this is the
next part of the tutorial this is how to
make a bootable USB pendrive so we want
to double click on you me here go to yes
open it up I agree and then select here
the 3 gigabyte partition and then what
we want to do is go to select a
distribution to put on G Drive and we
want to go all the way down to bot all
the way down the bottom here and go to
Windows 8 7 8 8 installer here
now what we want to do after this is we
will want to go to browse and we will
want to select our ISO here and here it
is here open and now after that after
you selected your ISO you can then go
create and click yes and so this will
take quite a while usually takes around
I think 40 years it's going to take
around 40 minutes so after it's finished
we now have a USB pendrive and it's
ready to boot so let's get on to the
next step and that's to insert your pet
USB pendrive into the fresh computer and
then press the power button and then
repeatedly press f8 until you get that
boot menu up and once you get that boot
menu up you can then select the USB
pendrive from the drop-down options so
as we can see here it's appeared here
that would be my io data USB pendrive
and then you'll see the u me come up
here the u me multi boot USB UI you can
then select your instable ISO there from
the windows 7 8 option and then you can
click install Windows 8 as we can see
here it's recommend it's recognized it
and we're good to go ok guys so that is
the end of the tutorial
and once we've booted back into Windows
and you've set up Windows the way you
want it and you want to start using your
pendrive as a normal drive like I said
or you can then do what you want to do
you can actually rename this and call
this the boot drive and it will store
that name and then you can go to open up
boot ice here and now we can quickly go
to parts managed and then we can now
click down to the one that's not boot
drive and click accessible set
accessible and you can see here it
automatically changed as well in this in
my computer this PC so that's the usable
portion and the icon changed as well so
this is removable storage now and we can
now use it as such so that is the end of
the tutorial guys I hope you enjoyed
this tutorial if you have any questions
or comments about this video then please
leave a comment in the comment section
below and if you haven't already
subscribed to tech yes City where I'll
be keeping up more tech videos and news
and I actually haven't done a tutorial
for
very long time so let me know in the
comment section below if you enjoyed
this tutorial then please give it a
thumbs up as well sorry this is the mic
that I'm just using for this video as
it's so easy to move around and maneuver
and type and do things with two hands I
didn't want to use my desktop mine
because I'm kind of I got more mobility
with this mic even though it does sound
pretty weak compared to mine you Det
knew so my desktop mic that I use for my
usual Tech Talk series anyway guys I
hope you enjoyed this video and I will
catch you in another tech video peace
