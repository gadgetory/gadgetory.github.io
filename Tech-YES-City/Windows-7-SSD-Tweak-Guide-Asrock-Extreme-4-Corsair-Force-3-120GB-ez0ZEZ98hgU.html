got a request to do an SSD tweet guide
so here it is guys first things first
let's go to our bus so we go into our
BIOS guys and basically we want to go to
so in Ana's rock extreme for I'm going
to go to advanced storage configuration
and basically I'm going to check and
make sure that my drives in AHCI guys so
you want to make sure it's in HCI and
you also want to make sure that this
here so this is important guys this is
probably the most important people don't
do is that you click on your SSD
manually here so it's on a side of three
port guys and you see Corsair 4 3 SSD
and we want to make sure that see it's a
solid-state drive so before it was
default will usually be a hard disk
drive you want to make sure it does
solid-state drive I did notice a bump in
performance after our chairs that option
now make sure that's selected and that's
selected and obviously before you apply
this tweak guide guys or you should make
sure as if as with anything before you
make any changes to your computer you
should always make sure that it's stable
beforehand and you know everything works
again so anyway guys this is the bio
section I'm going to boot into Windows
and then our boot into Camtasia I'm
going to show you the rest of the tweaks
in Windows and what to do so as this is
the first week guys in BIOS you just
change those two settings for the
extreme for there under storage
configuration AHCI
and click on the drive solid state drive
make sure those options are selected
yeah so that's the first a little bit
let's go on to Windows ok guys so we've
made sure those settings are enabled in
BIOS and now we're going to move on to
Windows so I'm using Camtasia Studio 8
now and we're going to basically show
you guys first I'm going to open up my
tweet guide for an SSD because obviously
I've forgotten a little bit of the steps
I use since it's been a while since I've
done this now the first step here is
basically yeah right-click on C Drive
properties and uncheck
indexing box so guys feel free to pause
at any time during this tweet guide as
well and you know sure yeah pause make
sure yeah if I'm too fast for you guys
just pause it so so let's go we go so
you go to computer start dry start
computer right click here properties and
local disk and you want to see that
there allow files blah blah blah
contents index in addition to a file
properties you want to make sure that's
unchecked then you go apply and you go
ok this will take about a minute or so
I've already done it so I don't need to
do it again so now we're on to the next
week disabled this fragment ok so I
actually enabled this before I did the
tweak guide just to show you guys what
it's like because you know as you
disable it in services it won't work
anymore so we open up this new fragment
and you want to make sure everything is
on never wrong
so obviously it'll be here really turn
off schedule and you can just turn it
off mind now let's change the turn on
schedule obviously so if we do that ok
run schedule okay figure scheduled run
on schedule okay see let me just turn it
off okay
so it's turned off all of our let's make
sure we do that and then we want to okay
so we can disable that later in services
will disable few services later now
System Restore so we want to make sure
the system restore is disabled so we go
to computer open control panel and I'm
pretty sure it's a system restore should
be in system system protection so you
want to make sure that's off so you can
click on configure mainly your SSD you
can use a backup guys I just click that
turn off system protection okay and
that's off okay and that'll free up
about I don't know it can free up
depending on your hard drive space I
think it freed up a few gig for me at
least which on an SSD is precious space
okay so that's that tweak done okay
let's move on to the next disable
hibernation to which does free up space
okay so for this one guys you want to go
to see accessories command prompt and
run as administrator and you want to
disable that setting mine's already
disabled but I'll show you what you do
anyway you just type in here sorry power
CFG /h off and that will make sure it's
ready off for me so it's very quick to
do it so that's that that'll free up
some more gigabytes on your system now
guys make sure the page files turn off
and this this tweak here is debatable
people say all you do you should use I
found my computer runs very good without
it on so I highly recommend it
system protection I think it's in
advanced yeah there it is so basically
you go to system properties Temptation
you know or whatever and go to advanced
here this tab next to system protections
go to performance settings and we want
to go to advanced ok and we wanted to
see this virtual memory now this is why
I recommend getting 16 gigabytes of RAM
guys because if you get a gigabytes
around you're probably going to need
that 8 gigabytes cache which
going to take out a gigabytes on your
SSD this will 16 gigabytes we can just
use only the RAM to give us that really
good performance in Windows and see here
you change it and you basically want to
say no paging file okay and then you
want to restart your computer this one
actually needs a restart to take effect
mine's already done so I don't need to
do it anymore
now let's get onto the next week guys so
here we go
obviously the next step after this is
power options turn on high-performance
okay so we go to control panel power
options and I've got mine on high
performance but also guys you can change
planner do mind attendants and off
display never put the computer to sleep
and I obviously did a hard disk turn off
hard disk never okay so they're the main
ones I also will quickly show up at that
the paused and that's about it going to
sleep after never it's about all I use
basically so that's yeah so that's power
options that may be affecting your hard
drive sometimes if you leave your
computer afk and the next step okay so
that's that down office we can right
click on SSD in device many properties
and check the box lash this one is that
a little bit of an extra boost
in that so again you click on right
click go to properties go to hardware go
to properties again go to change
settings of policies so you've got to
click on a lot of settings there so let
me show you again guys it's a lot of
things to click through you go to
properties hardware click on your SSD go
to properties again go to change
settings I'm pretty sure you change
settings policies so it's like so many
within and we're basically enabled write
caching on the device and we can turn on
windows right case your buffer flushing
on the device so now since my computer
is really stable I can put both of them
on I actually find I've actually found
guys and I probably recommend actually
doing this is that you know I actually
I've noticed very little difference
between having this one on and off I've
actually noticed a little bit write
caching on the diversity that's good
I've actually turned this one off
because I don't notice the difference so
and if there is a little bit of a power
blackout that one can cause corrupt
files like really dangerous so be
careful with that that's setting again
so just want to double check and make
sure it's there and I don't yet
personally I don't yeah I actually don't
recommend leaving that on unless you've
got a uninterrupted power supply so as
Windows does recommend so that's pretty
pretty solid advice from Windows 7 there
anyway so now for some regedit tweaks
guys these ones
now obviously guys i have a whole
windows 7 tweak guide which you can
check out and i'll post the link here in
the comments section was put in the
comment section guys you can check it
out and it's got a lot of good tweaks
especially to make it in 1080p and pause
it and do all the stuff Inc yeah so
that's you know do that if you want to
tweak Windows like mine's tweaked and
you know there's some other good tweaks
over this is an SSD tweaks typically
today so let's go to regedit so we go to
start menu regedit
and we can go to yeah my eye problems
with Google and an explorer with my
Outlook Express side to turn that off
and change them setting the regedit to
make it work now let's go to mmm this on
thirst H key local machine so the things
are they're basically system
currentcontrolset and so I'm pretty slow
doing this file system and yeah you want
to make sure
FTS disable 8.3 name creation yeah that
one that basically saves your computer
from making another file which does
increase performance ever so slightly
and NDF last access update so but that
one I've ready like I said that should
already be done just that one you got
the name creation you can change it
again so yeah change it to one and
that's how you do it so sure you've done
yet okay
now load is face checks this is the next
one in current user so it just collapse
them I mean sorry
yeah collapsing and
we go to this one yes software now I had
to make this one okay so this one I
actually had to make the folder I think
I'm never know if I've done it yet so
may have not even done this one yet but
I remember in the past I had to actually
make the folder so current user software
sorry it's just looking places different
places
please slow reading this case
card version
and policies
Explorer load net there we go so
Explorer no load disk space checks and
so value one as you can see so that'll
basically make it if you disk is long
space what's on the SSC it makes no
difference if the drives full or if it's
empty doesn't affect from some ancestor
at all they're designed differently to
hard drives so yeah check that too one
that will take that off and Lester the
last thing is guys some services take
off some services again so now you want
to take off disk Defragmenter there is
there get properties when you go
disabled and apply we're going to get
that off and ActiveX which I find was
already disabled anyway and offline
files so we want to get rid of all
flowing files as well now I'll find file
I was disabled and windows search I do
use Windows search as you can see else
doing search for MS services that MSC so
it's a good like windows search it's
good feature to have
I use mine Ashley on automatic not even
manual I like it so it's a good feature
and I don't notice any performance
differences in anything so now guys the
last thing I want to talk about you
might be like oh well why doesn't he use
for instance why doesn't he use super
fetch wising disable super fetching
prefetch I've actually disabled them and
I've tried with them with disabled and
you know with using them and I find
performance is better with them both on
so you know there you go guys I
recommend leaving prefetch and super
fetch on there actually good so there
you go guys if you've got any comments
let me know in the comment section below
or if you've got me of your own
suggestions that I may have missed
please let me know and as always peace
out for now and if you got any requests
- no I'll do so yeah guys peace out for
now writing complete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
