we entered a market that I've
never personally seen before,
and that is where we had the
price of brand new memory,
that's DDR4, skyrocket
to levels of double that
of what you'd be used to paying.
And then at the same time we also saw
the cryptocurrency boom
pretty much double the prices
of new graphics cards.
So what we had was a situation
where people just simply
didn't want to build
a brand new gaming PC,
'cause the price performance wasn't there.
And at the same time a lot of those people
came ushered into the used
price performance segment,
but even then that segment
couldn't fulfill the demand.
The prices of used parts
also went up at the same time
to the point where I had a rough time
doing monthly deals hunts.
But fast forward a year later
and we're now in a completely
different situation,
and in fact I'd argue we're
in the opposite situation
as we were to last year,
where it's actually never been
a better time in my opinion
to build either a used or a new gaming PC
if you want to get into PC gaming.
And today I'll give you guys some examples
also throw you some key statistics.
But before we do that, a quick message
from today's video sponsor
wix.com/go/techyescity,
if you use the link in
the description below
you can build a website completely
free no strings attached.
But I'll talk about
that later in the video.
Let's show you guys some examples.
So data points to November,
December and January
now becoming the key
three months of a year
where retail sellers
will want to try and sell
as much as they can
because the market with buyers want to buy
as much as they can.
And this market of course
includes PC resellers
who sell not only whole systems
but also components themselves
like graphics cards,
SSDs and CPUs and
motherboards for example.
Just because it's now March however
and the data points to this being
a very flat and mediocre month for sales
that doesn't mean you
could get a good deal.
In fact I'd argue it's
one of the better months
to get deals because retailers
still have to keep up the revenue
of their businesses to pay back loans.
And if they don't keep up that revenue
they could find themselves
in a difficult spot.
This means that you can
get some really good deals
in the month of March.
Now what we're gonna do
for this first new PC,
versus used PC is get a budget
entry level system going
and our budget is around
$350 U.S. dollars.
Now for a new PC, you could
build a Ryzen 2200G system.
It includes pretty much
all brand new parts,
a one terabyte hard drive,
a decent B450 motherboard
with room for upgrades in the future,
as well as having quite fast
DDR4 2933 megahertz memory.
This means we'll be to play
most titles in 2019 at 1080P,
whether it be low or medium settings.
So coming in just under
$350, this time last year
we couldn't build anything near this spec
if we wanted to get brand new PC parts.
However the same can also
be said for used parts.
What I've put together here
was a list of some of
the best deals I found
that were readily available,
and that is you can
purchase them right now
and still get great benefits
of used price performance.
For instance I found an Intel i5-3470S,
which is a four core, four threaded CPU
that has Ivy Bridges IPC
so it's actually not too bad for gaming.
And then over at AliExpress
we found a GIGABYTE H61
motherboard for $38.20
And now for the new parts,
we're gonna be using a 400
watt and 1 terabyte hard drive
and the same case as we used
with the Ryzen 2200 system
because getting those shipped
off AliExpress or eBay,
generally will be more expensive
than what you can get them for off Amazon.
However, we are still
going to be saving money
on our DDR3 memory versus DDR4.
In fact we're nearly
saving double the money
with two four gigabyte sticks
coming in at $30.37 shipped to your door.
And speaking of the brand for this memory,
I haven't used someone
else's bona in the past
but I have used KEMBONA before
and it is some good stuff.
Lastly our Intel i53470S
most likely doesn't come with a cooler
so we can go get a budget $10 cooler
that will do an absolutely fine job
of keeping this thing cool and stable.
So tallying up the bill
costs of the new build
versus the build that uses some
new and some used components
we have a difference of $101.67
so we can now utilize that money
and go out and buy a used graphics card.
On eBay at the moment
there's a seller selling
more than 10 RX 480s for
$85.55 with shipping included.
So we're still $16 ahead of the new build
and we're also gonna have a lot
better performance in games.
Now there's nothing stopping you
from going out and buying this RX 480
and coupling it with
the Ryzen 2200G build.
Of course that will raise your
costs to that of over $400
but you can still see how
good used price performance is
in 2019 and this is with
me just quickly checking
what deals are readily available
on eBay and AliExpress.
So when it comes to the budget
and you'll seriously wanna always consider
used price performance
because you can extract
so much value for money
and especially if you wanna go out like me
and go look for used deals locally
you can get even better deals
and put together something super cheap.
I'll put a playlist up here
for my PCs that are used
price performance PCs
so you get an idea of what
I like to pay for components
and how cheap I can put together rigs
that will play titles
in 2019, no problems.
But after we move away from the budget
and this is where things start to shift
in two different directions
because of course with buying new,
you've got parts readily available,
you don't have to go through the hassles
of going out looking for local deals.
And so if we look at
something like a Ryzen 5 2600
this is easily available for around $165
includes a CPU cooler,
six cores, 12 threads
and has great IPC.
And when we look at
something like an RTX 2070
you couple this with the Ryzen 5 2600
and you've got really good value for money
when it comes to building a
brand new high end gaming P.C.
But if we contrast that to the used market
Haswell i7-4770s for example,
they're coming in at roughly $140
and this most of the time
doesn't even include a cooler
and this is in my opinion sort
of like the minimum standard
you want to go if you're
getting into high end gaming
as the Haswell CPUs themselves
support generally all the
latest instruction sets
even though they are a few
years old to this date.
And to make matters worse
when we move up to
something like an i7-6700
they get even more expensive
usually with sellers demanding over $200
at buy it now prices.
And also when we look at
a graphics card like this
a GTX 1080 Ti these
generally can't be found
for any less than $500 U.S. dollars.
If you're in Australia
they're costing around $800
Aussie dollars at the moment
which makes an RTX 2070
actually come in cheaper
a lot of the times and that's brand new.
Yes it does have three gigabytes less VRAM
but in some titles they will trade blows.
And in this case of the GTX 1080 Ti
it probably won't have as much support
ongoing as the new RTX cards will have.
But the last thing I wanted
to talk to you guys about
is the risk of getting scammed
and it's a big risk in my opinion.
For instance when I was over in America,
I got hosed on a 1050 Ti.
Yes I got the graphics card
but the seller said it
worked and it never worked
and so I've got here a dud
which me flying back to Australia
I didn't have time to test
until I got back to Australia
and there's not a whole lot
I can do to get my money back
since the guy lives in the US.
And that's one risk that you will face
when you buy both used and new parts.
Some sellers will actually
list used parts as new parts
and in the case of a previous video we did
we looked at a seller that
was advertising a brand new PC
with a CPU from 2009.
It was absolutely
ridiculous, I'll put the link
for that video up here if
you haven't seen it already.
But in my opinion the most
common and abundant scam
is that of graphics
cards being sold on eBay.
Sellers will put up in the
title a GTX 1063 gigabyte
for example but when
you look at the listing
there's discrepancies in those listings.
For instance if you look at the
listing a little bit closely
you can see that the seller
is putting 128 bit bus
for the memory when this
card should have 192 bit.
So that's the first discrepancy
which points to this
graphics card being a fake.
The second thing of course
is the price is too good to be true.
So when it comes to
graphics cards always look
for established brands.
For instance GIGA-BYTE, ASUS, ZOTAC, EVGA,
GALAX, SAPPHIRE and the list goes on.
But guys all the worries aside
I hope the information in today's video
has helped you make that choice
whether you're thinking
about building a PC now
or just waiting a little
bit down the future.
Yes there's some good upgrades
coming later on in the year
like the Ryzen 3000 Series
and the new Navi GPUs
which may make prices even cheaper.
But as it stands
from what I'm doing
with my current research
I think it's still a very
good time to build a PC now.
who knows maybe when
those new pieces come out
the price of DDR4 memory
and motherboards may go up,
storage may go up.
However speaking of a good deal
today's video sponsor wix.com
probably has one of the
best deals out there
and that is you can pay nothing
and build yourself a website,
super quick, super easy,
no strings attached,
using the link in the description below
wix.com/go/techyescity.
And basically I've built myself a website
for selling used PCs locally
in literally 20 minutes
and I don't know anything
about building websites
and Java and HTML and
all that stuff you need
in order to build one
of these fancy websites.
Wix does it all for me
with the inbuilt editor
that pretty much just
streamlines making a website
through a user interface.
So it's really easy to do
and you don't even have to
sign up with a new account.
You can use your current Gmail account
or your Facebook account, log in via that
and then you can just start
building a website with these
and then publish it straight
away once it's ready.
And you'll have something's
that ready to go,
will service your needs if
you need to make a local blog,
a local selling site or
a local informative site
just to help people out.
The possibilities are almost endless
link is in the description
below wix.com/go/techyescity.
And with that said I hope
you enjoyed today's video
if you did then be sure
to hit that like button
and let us know in the
comments section below
what you guys think of the new market
versus the used market for PC parts
and building a new gaming PC.
Love reading your thoughts
