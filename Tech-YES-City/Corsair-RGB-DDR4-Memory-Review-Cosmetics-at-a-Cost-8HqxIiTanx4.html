they have managed to implement even more
RGB into a computer with ddr4 memory so
let's take a look at the features and
also how well this stuff overclocked
welcome back to exiting today we have
here some memory with four different
color mode static where you pick a
single color that doesn't change color
pulse where you can select up to seven
colors of the memory pulses through then
there is caller ship which gradually
shifts through up to seven selected
colors then lastly you have rainbow
which is the default setting out of the
box and this cycle through all the
colors on the spectrum over time you
also have the option to change the speed
of the colors and also group and ungroup
modules and delayed timings on the
caller shifts between different modules
all this is done via the course they're
linked software which I found extremely
straightforward and easy to use it also
works really well and I didn't
personally find there were any delays
fortunately as I heard bit wit for
example had some trouble with this so
now on to overclocking this stuff and
there were two different tests I ran
here first was finding the maximum over
club which on four sticks and tandem
unfortunately was only an extra 66
megahertz to make a total speed of 3056
megahertz over 16 17 1736 to timings
when comparing this to the
out-of-the-box 3000 megahertz that
compete profiles this was a very minor
overclock and honestly I would rather
just stick to the XMP profiles but what
about the tightest timings overclock
that I could get well things did get a
bit better here with a speed of 2666
megahertz at 14 15 15 30 for one team
timings though when running a quick 720p
Far Cry primal CPU intense benchmark
with XMP timings first the tightest
timings on this memory it resulted in
virtually the same results except for
the 2666 tight timing coming out
slightly behind in both minimum and
average frame rates though slightly
ahead in maximum so there it is the XMP
profiles is pretty much what you'll want
to stick to if you get this memory or at
least for the loan sample
received here today it was the software
build quality and also RGB lighting was
very nice to work with and this type of
memory will suit someone who is looking
for more RGB and more cosmetics on their
pc though coming in at roughly three
hundred twenty USD for a 32 gigabyte for
stick it and one hundred and sixty
dollars for a 16 gigabyte dual-stick kit
it is of course more expensive than
either OEM or single color statically
let ddr4 memory however the good thing
is is that you can port it over from
bill to build if you are changing color
schemes in your future rig for example
also some last minute things before I
get on out of here the pricing and
availability in Australia I will update
the description when I have more
information about that as it's currently
unavailable in Australia also if you
have an AMD am-4 platform the XMP
profiles won't unfortunately work so
that's like as X 370 motherboard all
those of course the memory will boot on
those platforms it's just that the XMP
profiles are only compatible currently
with Z 173 270 and x 99 motherboard now
guys I hope you enjoyed this video on
the course there are gb memory and if
you did them sure to hit that like
button and if you dislike this and be
sure to hit that dislike button and let
me know in the comment section below
what would you do for a stick of course
they are gb memory love reading your
comments as always and i'll catch you in
another text video very soon peace out
for now bay</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
