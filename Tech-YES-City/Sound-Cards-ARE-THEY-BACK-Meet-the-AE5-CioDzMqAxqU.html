and then suddenly there was a war on the
world gave up on them so creative didn't
and today marks the release of a new
sound card called the a5 which is
single-handedly making sound cards cool
again but just how cool is the a5 well
let's find out
welcome back to tech yes City this is
Brian and today we have a sound card a
PCIe sound card with AD active boast 122
decibel signal-to-noise ratio and has
0.0003 2% total harmonic distortion and
has support for 32-bit 384 kilohertz
playback extremely good and this is
provided by the ECC es 9 0 1 6 k 2m c
bar so this does all the digital
conversions to analog for your ears
however audio can still sound bad if the
amp or amps on board are not up to par
and this is where the sound card really
shines your lamps one for each year
creative a corner to xampp' technology
I'm calling it I'm blown away by the
numbers amp and here are the crosstalk
levels that's the level of audio leaking
from one audio channel into another of
the lowest I have ever seen and then to
further test the decamp combo here we
have the sweep test to see the frequency
response of the sound card and it was
phenomenal so neutral so smooth and no
bass roll-off at all absolutely none
this is an area where this sound card
will differ from onboard audio and
cheaper audio devices where on inferior
devices there will be the roll-off
effect and having a line like the a5 has
on this graph will give you richer bass
for your headphones and if your
headphones support it add a camp combo
like this will give you a shaking bass
because the lower frequencies can
come through there is also 5.1 sound
emulation at crystalizes bass
enhancement smart volume and dialogue
sliders the crystallizer snaps
frequencies together and can make
certain instruments more pronounced and
I personally don't use it same with the
bass enhancements bladder
those are surround emulation I do like
using it when playing role-playing games
and it did work well in players unknown
battlegrounds the smart volume and
dialogue tabs are great for watching
videos with unbalanced audio or watching
movies at nighttime where you don't want
to wake everyone up and only need voices
to come through
there's also EQ settings that have
profiles preset for games like dota 2
and this is all done by the sound core
3d quad core digital signal processor
this also functions as the ADC or audio
to digital converter that processes your
mic in or recordings and testing out the
mic input it was strong as always though
I will let you guys take a listen here's
what the mic input will sound like with
a BMO Debruyne probe plugged in with a
volume level of 50 at plus 20 DB on the
AE v with all effects removed so there's
no noise reduction or anything like that
there is also the ability to change your
voice by the software to things like an
orc
or any other crazy profile there and
there's also the standard noise
suppression and echo cancellation
available the Michael line imports also
support up to 24-bit 96 kilohertz
recordings and with 2017 being the year
of RGB creative of followed suit was
having the outer edge branding light up
with RGB which is adjustable via the
software itself and has many cool
effects to change through and they've
also included an RGB header and one RGB
lighting strip where I feel this is
questionable especially since you
already need a molex connector on the
rear of the card so having another set
of wires coming out of your sound card
did look a little awkward at least to me
and most motherboards already have their
own RGB headers nowadays anyway so
ultimately the numbers for this sound
card speak for itself the crosstalk
levels the bar wasn't even moving output
impedance 1 own supports 16 to 600 ohm
and 10
headphones has lots of powerful music
and I couldn't even go halfway up on my
V motors without going near deaf and it
features a dual amp designed with a DAC
that is one of the best out there so all
this comes in at a 150 USD retail so for
the money it is really good if you are
an audiophile and looking at somebody
that doesn't take up any desktop space
like an external DAC amp combo would and
this honestly is a decamp combo killer
for the money and sound quality you are
getting and on top of that you get all
the software too which is feature-packed
firstly I would have liked to have seen
no RGB header and no RGB strip included
and reduce the price accordingly but
2017 is here and so is RGB so the sound
blaster 85 is bringing sound back to
those who need it and all want it and
keep in mind that for the majority of
people with sub $100 headphones onboard
audio is still going to be plenty enough
this is the sound card that is designed
for those who want the absolute best
audio quality for their audiophile
headphones or speakers anyway guys if
you enjoyed this review then be sure to
hit that like button and let me know in
the comments section below what you
think of creative u85
sound card personally I've been
impressed with what has been coming out
of creatives labs lately and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
