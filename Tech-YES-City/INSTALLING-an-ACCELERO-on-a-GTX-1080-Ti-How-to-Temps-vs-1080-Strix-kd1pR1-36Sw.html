tried to play off this arctic Exelero on
a 1080 T I just subtly in the background
and hope that no one would notice
actually I didn't want to show it off
just a little bit although what do you
guys wanted to see how I install this
cooler on this card and also the before
and after temperatures so today I'm
going to be testing it against the GTX
1080 Strix which has a really good
aftermarket cooling solution on it and
it uses 100 watts less so we're going to
be putting this thing up against some of
the best out there and also on that note
I don't recommend pulling this off
as it'll void your warranty and you
really don't want to do that but it's
always cool to see things like this so
we've just pulled off the Titan X
reference cooler here that's the GTX
1080 and you see there's just so many
thermal pads there and also these little
ones here that relate to sort of other
different cooling so what we've got here
is I've already put the applies to the
heatsink song with a bit of heatsink
plaster and so that should be in place
now and I thought you guys might want to
know how I'm thinking about going about
this since a lot more people want me to
explain things so we can see here it's
really a tight fit we don't want to get
the heatsink anywhere near the little
surface mount devices there whether they
be caps or resistors otherwise you will
have a smoky graphics card the memory
the gb gddr5 X memory that's generally a
simple affair you just put it on dab it
on little bits dab dab dab dab dab dab
drop the heatsinks on and then you're
ready to go you can then plaster the
main heatsink on here the accelerators
are going to be dropping that on the
Titan sorry the GTX 10 atti
and then we're going to join the family
there so that's a 980ti
so for the thermal piece I'm going to
use some thermal Grizzly I like to call
it a thermal Griswald and this got sent
in from a subscriber he's actually
requested that I test this versus liquid
cooler Bora Tori's liquid pro that came
out wrong but anyway we had put those
head-to-head on a belated 7,700 cake off
to like 5.1 gigahertz so stay tuned for
that but in the meantime I trust that
it's better because like a lot of pee
the thing it's better in the
overclocking forums and stuff like that
so says here do not use with aluminium
heat sinks now it looks copper to me so
we're just going to go with that and put
it on here but we have to be very
careful with this because if it leaks
over or touches one of those little
chips to the side of the die then your
card will short out and have to take it
all off again and then clean it up and
it's just the waste of time so we'll try
and get it right the first time and
hopefully this works
so we've basically finished the lair
here - really really thin layer we had
to clean up that spill before because it
just came like shooting out man that was
insane like I you know I'm used to I
guess I'm just used to the liquid pro
stuff which is kind of really small and
slow but yeah you get a lot more of this
stuff so it feels like exactly like
liquid pro except you just get a lot
more of it so I guess that's the benefit
with thermal grisly but that's just in
terms of like spreading the stuff and
whatnot so it's trying to put the cooler
on the dreaded task this is going to be
interesting so I was going to mount this
with no backplate since these little
screws here actually lock into the
existing heatsink via this method and
then they screw on the back there so one
important thing that we're losing here
is there I guess the rigidity of this
input/output shield here so it's sort of
like flimsy so that said we're going to
have to put on the backplate somehow on
the back of here and so what I'll
thinking was was using these screws and
then putting the front there and then
tying down the actual backplate with the
cooler itself so because that way when
we mount it into a case this isn't going
to break in the future we can see there
it's a little bit flimsy without any
support
so there it is there's the first stage
now we have put on half a back plate so
that's something you don't see every day
and we've got here the balance when you
put on these coolers you have to make
sure the balance is so right on this so
looking right in there and the heat
things are kind of blocking it out on
this side but when we turn it around at
this side we can see that it's pretty
level I mean that should be good so
you're going to make sure that this this
part here is level with the dye on the
PCB so it looks pretty good this should
be cooling really well
well
you
there you guys have it the custom 1080
TI Exelero does extremely well not only
is it really quiet but the temperatures
are extremely low for a graphics card
that puts out even more power than a 980
TI overclock so this thing overclocked I
was getting around an extra 30 to 40
mega Hertz over the reference cooler and
the temperatures were much lower but
even compared to something like a 1080
Strix this thing was still performing
better in my opinion I mean the Strix
uses like 100 watts less and also the
fans get a little bit noisier if we set
the same custom fan profile so once you
do set those custom fan profiles to
around the same levels when the
temperatures are actually very similar
it's just that this thing is a lot
quieter at those same custom fan
profiles so though kudos to Arctic for
making a phenomenal aftermarket cooling
solution now all these coolers here
artic don't even know that I'm making
these videos I just bought all these
myself and the first time they came into
one of these coolers was in Japan when I
bought a GTX 780 which was like a junk
cooler but it still worked once I
cleaned it all up it had one of these
included and I was just blown away by
the performance of these coolers they're
just simply phenomenal
ultimately the Exelero is just a really
cool mod to do though keep in mind you
will void your warranty so I don't
recommend doing it unless you've got a
bit of experience and if you want to
gain a bit of experience maybe going to
the used graphics cards and pick up
something really cheap get some practice
like I've done in the past and then
you'll be on your way to getting much
better temperatures and even better
overclock but then guys hope you enjoyed
this video and if you did then be sure
to hit that like button and let me know
in the comment section below what you
think of the new Exelero
in family and I'll be sure to catch you
guys in another tech video very
peace out for now way
also the 4k performance the GTX 1080 had
slightly higher clocks and it was around
about a 25 to 33 percent gain in those
three games that I tested so 1080 Ti is
the legit graphics card really beast but
of course it does come with that beastly
price tag</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
