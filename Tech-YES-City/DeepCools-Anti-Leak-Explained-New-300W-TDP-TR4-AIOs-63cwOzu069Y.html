2019 at Deepcool's booth.
Now previously in 2018 and 2017
we've seen a lot of new cases coming out
but this time around is
a little bit different.
Their overhauling essentially
their whole lineup
of water coolers, and going hard.
But how hard are they going?
Well, they've got the
new anti-leak technology
and to easily describe it for you guys
it's essentially a valve on the outlet
that simply contracts as
the water gets hotter.
So basically, when the
computers off the water is cold
that valve will then expand
and essentially living up to the name
make it anti-leak technology.
But what else are they got besides that
in terms of their cooler models,
prices and release dates.
Lets go through all that for you guys
and then give you the verdict.
(techno music)
So starting off with the
lowest price point entry level
water coolers here, we've
got the Gammaxx L120 and 240
they've got the V2s
but they've also got
the V3s being released.
Now the V2s currently can't
be sold in America so I'm told
but the V3s will alleviate that problem.
Now in terms of compatibility and support
we're all the way up to AM4
these will support the
new X570 motherboards.
They also support the intel line of things
however if you want to get TR4
then you will have to step it up a notch
to the other coolers both
the Castle, and the Captain.
In terms of the coolers
here, they all feature RGB
this one features it on the
block and also a fan included
you get two fans included
on the 240 obviously
and it does come with a 12 volt controller
which it can then control that RGB.
So it isn't 5 volt addressable RBG
but that's not to worry since the price
it is coming in from $70
and I'll put the pricing of the four skews
up here for you guys
so you can check it out
if you're interested, that
color may tickle your fancy.
Now behind me is the Captain series
this has been one of their longest running
all-in-one Liquid series, this
time they are spicing it up.
They are putting a metal
pipe going to the block
from the external block itself.
Now, we got the anti-leak
technologies we said before
we've also got a dual
chamber cooling system inside
as well as getting the performance fans
on these models of radiators.
You got starting from 240 millemeter
going up to 360 millemeter.
In terms of pricing you get
to expect this to come in
from $105 and there is a $5 premium
if you want to get the wireless settings
since they do have to add that Duco
onto the actual radiator and block itself
and it goes up to $135
and $140 respectively.
In terms of RBG, it is 12 volt
and you do get the controller included
so you can change the
fancy colors and patterns
on the block itself.
In terms of the actual TDP what
rating this thing can handle
it's up to 280 watts and
they also add support for TR4
so if you want to mount
it an X399 motherboard
you can do just that.
Or if you want to go with
the X570, and get some bling
then this thing will definitely provide.
And then last up in the
lineup we have the model
with the most customization
in terms of not just the
RGB LEDs which is 5 volt addressable
but you also get the controller included
if you wish to do it that way.
But you can also take the cap off
and add your own little icon
in if you wish to do that
or if you just wish to leave
it out, you can even do that.
Now there's two models here
there's one that's geared
up towards performance
this is the Castle
360EX and also the 240EX
starting from $120 to $160.
Then besides that they've got the V2
which unfortunately isn't
available in America
and that is coming in with
a 240 and a 360 RGB version
and you do get two RGB
fans in the case of the 240
or three RGB fans at 120
mills in the case of the 360.
In terms of availability,
the Castle here on display
is currently available for sale
however the other five
models that we talked about
will be available throughout June.
So they're releasing very soon
they're serious about
this anti-leak technology
but the coolers I've seen so far
they do look like they're acquired
and I will be putting them
through the test bench
here at Tech YES City.
And with that aside, I hope
you enjoyed our booth coverage
at Deepcool for 2019's Computex.

Also let us know in the
comment section below
what do you think about these
new cool design display here.
Are you digging the new look on the blocks
or aren't you digging that look.
Love reading your thoughts and opinions
as always, and I'll
catch you guys with this
beautiful gold mic in the
next tech video very soon.
Peace out for now, but
also on your way out
