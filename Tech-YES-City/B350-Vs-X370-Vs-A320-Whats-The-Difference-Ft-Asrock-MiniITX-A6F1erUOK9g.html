motherboard or an X 370 motherboard
however in the case of a mini ITX
motherboard there exactly the same thing
so this is a very odd dilemma one which
we'll be talking about today besides the
usual differences between these chipsets
welcome back to tech es city this brand
coming to you guys today with that video
on a m4 platform and it's their newest
architecture in 2017 from AMD
now one thing they've done right this
time around is they've generalized the
platform and so you can use the upcoming
AP use and also the CPUs all on the same
motherboards as opposed to the Past
where they actually had FM 2 sockets and
am3+ sockets which did complicate things
especially if you're in the market for a
cheap CPU and you wanted to upgrade
later to an 8 core CPU from AMD's lineup
so that's a good thing that there's no
more confusion there however they do
have different chipsets the a320 the be
350 and also the X 370 and now the new X
3 9 9 which is a different actual socket
altogether so X 399 will quickly get
that out of the way with very expensive
it's for the 1950 X which is that
high-end desktop 16 core 32 threaded CPU
and it does perform really well I've
actually done a review on this I'll put
the link up here and it's a really good
CPU if you need a save time especially
when it comes to productivity tasks
however back to the main three in this
video the a320 be 350 and X 370 now
these are licenses that AMD license to
the motherboard manufacturers for a
certain price that which I am not sure
of but I do know one thing it's
generally cheaper there's less features
you get for example the a320 will be
cheaper than the be 350 and the v3 50
license will be cheaper than the X 370
and so what this enables the
manufacturers to do is bring the cost
down of motherboards in that certain
bracket however when we look at the cost
associated with the a320 motherboards
they generally are the cheapest
motherboards available and with that you
do get two less PCIe gen two lanes than
the be 350 platform and also for less PC
Gentoo lanes then the X 370 platform you
also do not get overclocking on the a320
architecture and also with that you get
one less gen 3.1 USB port and now we're
gonna take a look at the be 350 license
and this is easily my favorite chipset
of 2017 you get support for overclocking
and you really get a host of different
features that's really all you need for
most gamers and even for people doing
productivity you get four lanes of ddr4
memory that support sixty four gigabytes
which is perfectly fine for 4k video
editing you also get a 16 speed PC a
three bus for your graphics card and
also get support for m2 nvme however
compared to the x3 70 you do get two
less PCIe - gen lanes from the chipset
and you also get less USB 3 I believe so
those two features together you do get a
little bit less than the X 370 however
the average cost is something very
interesting here when I tallied up on PC
part picker be 350 motherboards I found
the average cost to be $89 when we
looked at the X 370 chipsets the average
cost of a motherboard was a hundred and
sixty three dollars so that's a
difference of 74 dollars and then of
course we coupled that with the risin 5
1600 for example you've got yourself a
really good combo on a budget that just
offers such good value for the money
however not to discredit the X 370
license of course that's got all the
features enabled for rise and three
thousand five and rise and seven CPUs
and I find in general though yes the
motherboards on average are more
expensive than be 350 motherboards in
some cases the VRMs can be a lot better
and you also get more overclocking
features on an X 370 motherboard in
general so one thing I found on a lot of
be 350 motherboards not on all actually
some do have this feature is of course
the V root function which allows the
voltage to stay at the same level that
you set it at after the CPUs loaded it's
also called load line calibration as
well this feature is practically on
every X 370 motherboard and when we make
a comparison between two motherboards
for example a be 350 pro 4 from asrock
and also an X 370 Taichi from as rock
one is $99 the other is a
$99 currently what we see is we've got a
six phase power delivery to the CPU
versus a twelve phase on the X 370
variant not to mention the actual
MOSFETs and parts used on the vrm are
better in general so if you're into
enthusiasts overclocking and you want to
get really good over clocks out of your
eyes at seven eight core for example
then it is of course a better
consideration to go with the next 370
motherboard one thing I'd like to see
and one thing I'm curious about with be
350 motherboards is if that actual
license has a limit on the amount of
phases and components used on the VRMs
because I'd love to see a be 350
motherboard that has a vrm like the
Taichi implemented on it I think it'd be
an absolute hit in terms of its
popularity so now it's time to talk
about that part that I hinted at in the
intro the B 350 and X 370 Mini ITX
motherboards now asrock were kind enough
to send us out both these boards and
I've already actually done a build with
one that I bought in Japan using the
Ragin tech metas I'll put the link to
that build up here if you wish to check
it out and also there's only three
manufacturers currently in the mini-itx
realm on a m4 that manufacture mini ATX
motherboards that being biostar has
rockin gigabyte and what i've noticed
with these motherboards and especially
when i was shopping for one in japan
when I was doing the used parts hunts
was that I couldn't actually find a
physical difference between the B 350
and X 370 multiples since the be 350
license enabled all the features on the
be 350 mini ITX board versus the X 370
in other words you were wasting features
if you bought this license for a mini
ITX board and it was quite ironic
because when I asked the sales staff
what were the difference they just quite
simply said the X 370 was better without
giving me a reason and then I actually
asked asrock what is the difference
between the b3 15 X 370 Mini ITX boards
and they were honest enough to just
reply and say nothing which confirm my
suspicions and that is you're just
simply paying for an X 370 license on
these Mini ITX boards however looking at
the be 350 Mini ITX board from asrock
it's got all the features that I would
need from a Mini ITX board hence why I
picked it you've got that dual band Y
us on the back and you've also got a
MDOT 2 mini slot on the rear of the
board so even though you've got a small
form-factor such as this as rocker have
crammed in all the essential features
that I would need personally out of a
board like this and of course you've
only got those 4 SATA 3 ports which are
supported on a be 350 license just like
they would be on an X 370 license
however one thing I will stress with
Mini ITX motherboards and this has been
true for years now is their VR ramps
there's quite simply not enough space on
a mini ITX board to include a VR M
that's is good for instance as a
full-size ATX X 370 board so with the be
350 mini ITX board
you only get a three phase which i
believes is doubled to six through smart
technology a six phase erm dedicated
towards the CPU and now this does have
its limitations when it came to
overclocking I had a rise in five 1600
that went up to 3.8 gigahertz add some
sweet spot settings however when I took
it to four gigahertz it did throttle the
motherboard and things did get hot and I
did have to turn this motherboard off
and then drop it down to three point
eight gigahertz so if you are into
building a mini ITX build on Rison then
you may wish to be careful and not go
full ball with an eight core and water
cooler and expecting yourself to get
four gigahertz day and day out because
that might not be the case
and when I've checked the V RMS on the
biostar and also the gigabyte variants
for example they too were not performing
as well as their bigger ATX counterparts
so that's one thing to keep in mind when
it comes to building a mini ITX build in
general you guys hope you enjoy today's
video and if you did - be sure to hit
that like button and let me know in the
comments section below do you currently
own a B 350 or X 370 motherboard if so
why did you pick one over the other if
not which one would you buy love rating
your comments as always and another
thing with the Mini ITX boards on the
Rison am 4 platform is that they are
generally inexpensive I picked up the B
350 from asrock for around about $100
for the size and all the features it has
it's actually a really good buy so I can
highly recommend it
someone building a mini ITX build just
keep in mind it does have its
limitations and with that I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon peace
out for now bye
actually there is one interesting
difference between the be 350 in the ex
370 motherboards on the Mini ITX lineup
on asrock and that is that one has the
antennas that's the B 350 and the X 370
has a module for the wireless and
especially ironic because I prefer the
antennas over the module sight gets the
B 350 for me personally on the Mini ITX
lineup is the better by not just in
terms of savings but in terms of
features</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
