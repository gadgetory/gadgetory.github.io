way over in Italy send me in his
motherboard CPU and RAM he thought it
was cursed he was playing Battlefield
one with a 1080 TI and he was simply
getting stuttering and he hated the
experience he said Brian I'm gonna send
you this cursed motherboard 4790k and
memory kit and I want you to test it and
see if you can recreate the stuttering I
was getting and I said to him the 4790k
should not be a problem you should get a
really good experience with a 1080 TI so
today I'm gonna patch this whole thing
up get it working and see if we can
recreate the conditions or if we do from
the get-go get a really good experience
then we'll do some post diagnosis and
see what could have been wrong on Vasily
setup welcome back to tech es city and
going through this configuration of
parts that we have here today we have
the gigabyte Black Edition z97 X in
gaming one Wi-Fi BK motherboard actually
quite an expensive motherboard and it
does support Quad SLI so after we're
done testing the 1080 TI on this thing I
do have other plans for instance 2 GTX
690 s going head-to-head with a 1080 Ti
so stay tuned for that
we've also got the 4790k now Vasili has
already deleted this cpu and upon
pulling it apart it was actually very
dirty with this being tech es city we
have to give this CPU a wash and clean
it up with detergent
oh my god did he just wash that CPU dip
detergent and water
somebody called Lewis Rossmann right now
now continuing on with the bill we're
using the f SP 500 watt power supply it
has 39 amps on the 12 volt line so it
should do a fine job of powering the 10
atti and also the 4790k when it's
overclocked we've got 2 8 gigabyte
sticks of RAM to make a 16 gigabyte
configuration in dual channel and this
is from g.skill now for the hard drive
we're using a 2 terabyte fire kut'r as i
believe this is all we need the silly
was actually using an SSD which is even
better so we're using a worst part but
I'm still confident all these parts will
work fine and then for the case we've
got the BitFenix sensor which comes in a
99 USD chips with two fans has tempered
glass on one side and also has that
power supply covered shroud and the
front lights up RGB so you've got a lot
of options with this thing but of course
after we're done building with it we'll
talk about that a little bit more and
then for the grams card this is the
monster 10 atti from Oris this thing has
a power limit of 150 percent it is just
an absolute beast
it will get better performance than a
reference 1080 Ti so if anything's gonna
bottleneck this CPU it's going to be
this gravis card so without further ado
let's get on with this build and see if
we can get some stuttering
so here we have with the bill complete
and I must say it looks very schmick
especially for a build that only took me
literally an hour to build it was really
quick and the RGB strip I even forgot to
put that in initially we added that in
quickly and it does give off a really
nice subtle glow the deep cool gam acts
cooler looks really nice in this build
too however that aside it was now time
to get on into the stuttering mess that
Vasily reported over in Italy and try
and diagnose what was going on and it
was at this first step when I booted the
PC installed windows I noticed one
problem that was occurring we were
getting a blue screen of death and the
first thing that came to mind was simply
bad overclocks tuned into the bias
because I actually didn't reset the BIOS
in between getting this motherboard and
then installing it into this build so I
went into the bias checked things out
and we had a 4.9 gigahertz overclock
locked in now this is a very aggressive
overclock for a Haswell CPU even the
Haswell refresh and this can cause
problems especially in the form of
thermal throttling which will indeed
give you that stuttering mess however we
did have another problem one which I've
never seen before we tuned it down to
4.7 gigahertz and in this case we
started the stress test up
it was indeed thermal throttling quite
quick however even with the CPU thermal
throttling you should still be able to
do things like copy files and so as I
was copying my games over I got an error
message that I've never seen before this
was a really odd message so at this
stage not only did we have an unstable
overclock on the CPU we also had
possibly two other problems the first
things that came to my mind was the
memory now we've got XMP profiles at 24
hundred megahertz now sometimes you can
in rare instances have a memory set of
profiles that just passed it in the
factory but on a hundred percent stable
however in this case I believe they were
fine it's just over time memory just
like a CPU can degrade and so you're on
that fine point and now your XMP profile
is no longer work however there was also
one more problem we're using creatives
onboard audio now in the past creative
have had driver problems with their
devices so it could either be that all
the
memory and then on top of all of that to
further complicate things we now have
the CPU thermal throttling quite quickly
so perhaps we don't have a good contact
between the die and the IHS which could
mean in very rare circumstances again we
could have an lid on the CPU that's not
perfectly flat or not close to perfectly
flat so we may have to do what I call
the mx4 sandwich and since mx4 is non
capacitive non conductive you can drop a
lot of this stuff on and then it'll make
a good connection between not only the
cooler and the heat spreader but also
the heat spreader to the die so we're
gonna get that done now see what we can
do
so now we've applied so much mx4 thermal
paste we now have a faster throttling of
the CPU which means that our initial
application of the liquid metal was
absolutely fine however this means that
our CPU and our cooler combination quite
simply can't handle the 4.7 gigahertz
overclock so what we have to do now is
drop it down to a happy medium so first
off we're just gonna try 4 gigahertz
because perhaps we have one of the most
leakiest CPUs on the planet I mean it
does boot at 4.9 gigahertz on this
configuration however it won't even run
stable at 4.7 gear goats without even
transferring heat to the cooler I mean
the cooler is remaining really cool
while this thermal throttling happening
so first off we tried 4 gigahertz just
to make sure that everything was fine
with this CPU and we're getting in the
mid-60s so our configuration was fine
for 40 Hertz and we also had a bit more
Headroom so upping the overclocks to 4.4
gigahertz showed us that we now had a
happy medium in terms of overclocks and
temperatures we were hitting about 80
degrees I was happy with these
temperatures and before we even start
playing any games I want to make sure
that we're passing stress tests
nothing's crashing and our temperatures
are ok and as we said before with the
memory we dropped this down to 2133
megahertz
with pretty tight timings and it was at
this stage we had no more error messages
we were now ready to get in to the games
and check if we were getting any
stuttering
so the first game we had up here with
the 1080 TI replicating Vasilis exact
same setup that he was telling me was
having problems with we were getting
smooth frame rates absolutely fine
1080p single player ultra settings was
getting near 200 FPS and then of course
what about multiplayer this is where
Vasily was having his problems
stuttering to the point where he's just
losing his matches he was getting
frustrated and when I was doing this it
was a smooth experience yet again so
sometimes it just helps to get a stable
overclock rather than having no
overclock at all or having too
aggressive of an overclock and this is
what we're seeing when we're testing the
other games went on to Far Cry primal
again very good scores over 120 average
fps Tom Clancy's the division great
frame rates no blue screens of death no
error messages completely smooth
experience Metro last light going near
300 FPS everything was just buttery
smooth I even decided to throw in Crysis
3 at which point this was smooth as well
clocking over a hundred fps in this game
and power consumption from the wall was
only 400 watts so this configuration
even with a 500 watt power supply
everything was running mint so now we're
gonna analyze what happened on Vasilis
end and I was gonna say that Vasily
perhaps was just being a little bit
silly but it wasn't the case he actually
had a combination of problems and this
led to a very stuttery experience in my
opinion first thing the memory it now no
longer works on those XMP profiles you
will get problems and in this case just
clock it down a little bit and you'll
have a good experience still it's much
faster than the 1,300 and 33 megahertz
default which again if you had this CPU
on default with those memory speeds
you'd probably get an undesirable
experience as well
however the CPU overclock that as well
was causing problems it was thermal
throttling especially at 4.9 gigahertz
it was just too much to handle even for
a water cooler I believe this would have
problems so he dropped it down to 4.4
gigahertz found a happy medium and in
the end everything was running buttery
smooth of course I always
do recommend overclocking but I will say
if it's at the expense of stability then
don't do it I'd much rather have your
default settings locked in and you get a
good experience than trying to overclock
and have it unstable but keep in mind if
you do overclock and you do get those
settings stable then you're gonna have a
really good experience that beats that
of the default settings so now it's time
to talk about this case beside me the
Enzo and building and it was
surprisingly very easy I thought because
it was like a medium sized case and it
wasn't that large I thought I'd have
some difficulties but no very spacious
to work inside the power splash shroud
cover at the front really does a good
job of making this in easy case to work
in with not just cosmetics but also
covering up any bad cable management so
if you like me and you're very quick on
your cable management and you use
ketchup and mustard power supplies then
something like this especially for $89
is going to do a really good job of
helping an amateur build their
nice-looking PC and I'll surprised this
thing took me one hour to put together
and I think in the end it was one of the
nicest looking PC builds I've done keep
in mind the deep cool gamax air cooler
actually does look really good it's
performance is mediocre I will say that
4.4 gigahertz was the happy medium that
are at about 25 degree ambient
temperature their cable extensions they
look very good as always there the game
of chief budget cable extensions in
Australia on eBay they come pre combed
really nice with this case as well you
get two fans prints tour one at the back
being RGB at the back of the case
there's an RGB controller which in this
case I did hook the deep cooled gamax up
to and the LED strip and I had no
problems at all it's all in sync when I
press the RGB button at the front it
changes the colors there's also a Zeus
or a sync as well if you're using an AMD
board from a zoo so you're using an azuz
or a sync board then you can hook that
into the controller and control your RGB
lighting from the motherboard itself via
software though other things with this
case you can mount a 240 ml radiator at
the top or at the front of the case and
with that you can take off the front
panel and install another fan if you
wish to at the back of the case there's
two 3.5 inch mount drive bays that are
really quick to install drives into
there's also SSD support and we
that you get a shroud cover up the top
that you can change from breathable to a
hard coating though I did use this hard
coating just inside the case itself to
cover up some poor cable management
since I did have a non modular budget
power supply I just wanted to show that
this case is very easy to work in not
just with cable management but also each
of the build itself and I know you guys
wouldn't forgive me if I didn't look at
temperatures with the Enzo so with the
tempered glass side panel on we've got a
maximum temperature on the CPU of 95
degrees and with the GPU is hitting 77
degrees now with the tempered glass side
panel off we then got 89 degrees maximum
and the 1080 TI aura scored 73 degrees
now keep in mind this is with 400 watts
roughly getting dumped into this whole
case so that top ventilation area was
doing a very good job of clearing out
the heat and of course tempered glass is
difficult to work with it's basically
like putting a whole insulation side
panel on your case so the two included
fans were doing a pretty decent job
however I would like to see the front of
the case opened up a little bit more to
allow more airflow but with that said
you probably won't want to put anything
more powerful in this case especially in
terms of a hotter CPU so ultimately with
the Enzo 89 US dollars comes with two
fans tempered glass power supply shroud
cover there's two removable dust filters
at the front and one on the bottom for
your power supply very easy to work with
if I had to critique one thing however
it would be the rubber grommets inside
the case for the two big cables the
rectangular ones I'd like to see them
actually silicon door glued onto the
case because when I was pulling cables
through they just came off instantly and
there are a pain in the ass to get back
on that would be my only thing to
critique with this case other than that
very nice case even for the money I can
recommend this thing to you guys if
you're doing a new coffee lake or rise
and build or even if you're doing a
build with use parts something like this
is really good with ketchup and mustard
power supplies with just cable
extensions anyway guys hope you enjoyed
today's build and drop a comment in the
comment section below if you've got
stuttering problems that you can't fix
perhaps I or someone else in the comment
section can help you out and also let me
know what you think of the answer
of course I'm just gonna leave this
review and just say that it ain't so
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
