it's finally here this is the risin ap
use first off we have the risin 320 200
G comes in a 99 USD or if you're in
Australia 139 strained dolls now has 4
cores 4 threads and onboard Radeon Vega
graphics besides that is the risin 5 the
big brother 2400 g4 cause 8 threads and
also a beefier Radeon Levin Vega
graphics solution on board now this cost
169 USD or if you're in Australia 235
Australian dollars now today's
comparison you guys requested it this is
everything you guys requested in the
previous video we scrapped all the games
that we had planned for this video and
tested with the ones that you guys
requested competitive multiplayer titles
and we're testing it against the
competition in a similar price bracket
rx 550 and also a GT 1030 from Nvidia so
the games that we're testing Pub Jeep
csgo dota 2 49 GTA 5 and Rainbow six
siege and we're testing him at playable
settings
so we're generally going to be looking
for more than 60 FPS and for instance in
pub G I had to drop it down to 720p
because it was just not playable at
1080p on any of these graphics solutions
pull that aside let's get on with those
results that y'all came to see
welcome back to tech yes City and
pulling up the first of the numbers dota
2 now you'll notice from the numbers
we've got here three different memory
speeds across the 2400 G and also the
2200 G this is to give you guys an idea
of how performance will scale across the
AP use with faster memory so if you wish
to go purchase faster memory you'll know
what you can expect with that a more
expensive purchase or if you just want
to overclock your memory high enough to
get that extra performance itself also
with the GT 10:30 and the rx 550 I
tested that on the Rison 3 1200 with the
exact same memory that I tested on this
apu solution as well this is I believe
the most real-world close comparison
you'll get to the AP use because we're
using a similar CPU clocked out to 3.5
gigahertz by the way and also in terms
of value you're coming pretty close to
the AP use even though the AP users are
coming in cheaper and the one dedicated
solution is still getting more
real-world than say an 8700 K and a GT
1030 for example but what we can see it
with the dota 2 results the apu is
getting really close to the GT 1030 the
rx 550 is pulling away by a little bit
in this game and you will see this trend
continue across different games looking
at csgo we can see here that the rx 550
again was leading the pack the GT 1030
did come in second place and then the
2400 G scaled down with the 2300 G in
terms of its memory speeds and of course
it's bigger beefier GPUs solution but
what we saw also with the 0.1% lows was
that in that smoke section it was really
low this was not an enjoyable experience
on any of the graphics solutions put
forth in this test here but it was at
1080p and I did copy a very popular Pro
csgo player settings his name was scream
and he uses these custom settings I'll
just pull them up for you guys even
though the resolution is a little bit
higher I personally enjoy playing this
game at sixteen by nine you know the
next game we're pulling up for you guys
is fortnight 1080p settings as well this
was on the lowest possible settings
because this is where the 2400 G in the
2200 G really had a smooth experience
keep in mind you'll see by some of those
0.1% Lowe's Wallace benchmarking there
was some dips and now I did update the
BIOS on this MSI motherboard to the
latest BIOS and it did help a little bit
but it's stuttering or the drops of the
choking as I'd call it was still present
in some of the benchmarking you can see
that with those numbers the rx 550 and
also the GT 1030 did not exhibit this
behavior and the GT 1030 scored a little
victory over the 2400 G but then the rx
550 scored a little victory over the GT
1030
so either way across all these solutions
here fortnight was really enjoyable at
1080p and you could play it on a budget
so next up here we got GTA 5 a popular
title requested by you guys and what we
could see with the numbers here was its
scaled in tandem pretty much just like
the other games the memory speeds did
affect performance just a little bit but
what we saw just like for tonight was
some very odd stuttering occurring that
did show in some of the benchmarks with
the 0.1% lows on the rise and apu
solutions the GT 1030 did score a
ever-so-slight victory over the rx 550
and then of course the rx 550 came in
just a little bit faster than the 2400 G
but either way 1080p on normal settings
with GTA 5 a playable experience on all
four of these solutions yet again and
now pulling up the second last game on
display is Rainbow six siege 1080p
lowest settings though I did set the
resolution scale to a hundred percent as
I believe sending it below this it just
makes the game look horrible in my
opinion at a hundred percent lowest
settings that look pretty good and the
benchmark numbers showed that the rx 550
scored the victory and it was good to
see that the APU in this particular
title the 2400 G did score a victory
over the GT 1030 so the GT 1030 was
really falling behind in this game in my
opinion but was good to see that the rx
550 in the 2400 G were leading the race
with really good frame rates and this
was a playable experience on all four
solutions but I will give the edge to
both the APU and the rx 550 and now I'm
saving the worst for the last game here
this is pub G even though the game is
very enjoyable it is still pretty badly
optimized at least for PC and what we
saw with the results here was the 2400 G
did get some decent frame rates and now
I had to drop it down to 720p because
1080p was not playable on all four
solutions here it was just horrible
there was stuttering present on all four
at 1080p the stuttering was horrible on
the AP user 1080 people when I dropped
it down to 720p
we did get some frame rates that were
pretty decent and I could have a fun
time keep in mind the stuttering at 720p
was still present in the 2400 G and also
the 2200 G but what we saw were frame
rates that were pretty decent I mean the
2400 G went close to 50 fps the 2200 G
did struggle a bit especially with those
0.1% lows at 720p but the rx 550 did
score the victory here with 59 fps so
coming very close to that 60 mark and
the 1030 getting close to the 50 mark so
was a clear victory for the rx 550 and
the 2400 G scored very close I think
actually getting right on the money with
the GT 1030 in this benchmark and now
quickly for some synthetics Rison on the
Cinebench scores here the AP use scored
just like they would with the rise in
CPU solutions so getting some good
numbers and then for the power
consumption the AP used did extremely
well especially on those idle wattage
numbers I was surprised at what I was
seeing max load this solution
fully under load and csgo was scoring
around about 56 watts max with the
memory overclocked so I did beat the GT
1030 and also the rx 550 solutions by a
little bit and so if you want to put
this in a home theater PC you are going
to be getting very good performance but
also very good efficiency out of these
two apu solutions especially the 2400 g
with his four cores and its eight
threads so there's the numbers for you
guys and you will have to excuse me it
is very hot in the Gold Coast at the
moment and I don't have my aircon for
another few days so I have to bear with
the heat and get this review done for
you guys but what we saw with those
benchmark numbers was some impressive
figures the apu solutions are here and
they are here to stay the $99 2200 g
impressed me the most it had some really
good performance figures especially with
those low memory speeds you could still
get an enjoyable experience on dota 2
csgo
even for tonight's so if you're into
playing those very popular multiplayer
titles I think fortnight's got over 3.4
million concurrence at one time so it's
very popular then something like this
and some ddr4 memory if you can pick it
up maybe an 8 gigabyte dual channel kit
will give you a very good experience at
1080p or if you want to step it down to
720p will do that too now for
overclocking the AP use and also these
other GPUs I didn't have time for that I
will get another dedicated video doing
both overclocking and also I will be
testing a single stick of memory a lot
of you guys requested that so don't
worry I do read those requests and I
will get them done in the next week for
you guys
I'll also be comparing it to the HD
graphics as well but I will give you
guys a spoiler the reason I didn't put
the HD graphics in this comparison was
in the past I've tested the coffee lake
HD graphics solution in that at for
instance at 720p lower settings now the
pubsey benchmarks you saw here was a
hundred percent screen scale in the HD
graphics when I tested that I had a 70
percent lower settings possible in pub G
and that couldn't even get up to 20 fps
so these Verizon ap use were getting
near 50 fps and that was a hundred
percent screen scale so if I drop that
down to 70 probably get 60 so it was
like at least three times better then
the HD graphics solution at least from
the pub g-numbers so HD graphics are
really sort of in a lower league than
all the four solutions on the table here
today so I will do another video on that
soon but what we saw here was a little
value King that's coming in and it's
sort of overshadowed a little bit with
ddr4 Ram prices because you saw those
benchmarks you will want fast ddr4
memory and you want to overclock it to
get the most out of these APU but the
problem is is with those prices being so
high you're probably going to have to
settle for twenty four hundred megahertz
ddr4 memory and hope to clock it to 2666
so if you do that you'll get some decent
performance especially out of the 2400 G
but of course being on a budget that
extra 70 USD I'm not sure where my
recommendation is going because I am
torn between the 299 USD I do like the
2200 just a little bit more
I think it represents excellent value
for money especially for someone who
wants new parts doesn't want to mingle
with use parts and wants pretty decent
gaming performance on a budget this is
the one I'm leaning towards and they
both include rape stealth coolers by the
way and the cooling solution is pretty
good if you turn up the fan speed to
100% which is what I did for the
benchmarks you'll notice absolutely very
low noise and you'll still get a really
good experience so there's the numbers
for you guys and these two graphics
cards here the GT 10:30 in the rx 550
they're practically made of relevant in
my opinion unless of course you want to
get a really cheap used CPU and used
motherboard and you want and you can't
buy a graphics card anywhere
surprisingly enough the rx 550 is
actually sold out in America I guess
people are that desperate for Earth
mining that they're putting these things
now on they're probably 19 slot
motherboards now also talking about
mining with the 2200 G and 2400 G I'm
actually not going to be talking about
it here today because I just don't think
there's much value in buying one of
these and then going out getting a
motherboard memory SSD power supply
order mine off something that's pretty
much entry-level in terms of its
graphics performance so at least
compared to a dedicated GPU solution so
didn't really see the value from doing
that testing though if you guys want to
see it and lately I've sort of copped a
lot of flack for doing testing with
crypto so I'm sort of on a bit of a
cool-down here but if you really want to
see it drop a comment let me know if you
want to see it or not but in terms of
AMD and these ap use and what they've
done with them I really like these
solutions low powered
work well with the included coolers you
can overclock both the graphics solution
and the CPU solution from the bias as
well I will be bringing that in another
video but I hope you guys enjoyed this
dedicated review here today if you did
then be sure to slap that like button
and let me know in the comments section
below if you want to see some other
tests I'm gonna be doing the single
stick of memory the overclocking is well
I'll be doing that in another video but
if there's some other tests you want to
see let me know in the comment section
below and I'll be getting that done for
you guys but as it stands the 2200 G
little value King especially for the
money besides that the 2400 G
is its big brother great for people who
want that real small solution and as you
saw in my previous video I put this
thing in the in wind choppin and it was
a great solution I mean it was small
it's got the powerful little graphics on
it and it's also got the four cores
eight threads so both solutions hit the
market really well in my opinion I've
also got a giveaway coming with the 2400
G I'll be doing that in a separate video
teaming up with some other tech channels
as well so stay tuned for that full mini
ITX PC this thing's gonna be so small so
powerful great for mobile video editing
as well look forward to giving you guys
that video too and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
I'll pull up the first game dota 2 and
what you can see here just do the
Japanese want you on the GT 1030 that
scored pretty well d and now the next
game we're gonna pull up for you guys is
fortnight so this is how I mounted the
SSD for benchmarking usually you meant
to screw it down but if I screwed it
down on this motherboard for some reason
it just didn't work so yeah just left it
up for benchmarking that's whatever it
takes to get the numbers let's do it
yay that wasn't meant to happen but it's
got strong pins on us you know have to
worry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
