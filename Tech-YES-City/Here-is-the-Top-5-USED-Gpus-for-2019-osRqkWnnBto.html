graphics cards coming out with ray
tracing features and then there's new
graphics cards coming out with Radeon
image sharpening
however they costs $300 or more and a
lot of cases they're out of people's
budgets but today's top 5 list of GPUs
as much as I like local deal hunting
these ones are readily available anyone
in the world can get them and at their
price points they're actually not bad
value for money and they will do 1080p
gaming perfectly fine so with that aside
let's get on the list but then later in
the video I'll also talk about some of
my favorite local deals that I'm
searching for at the moment and give you
guys the full tech yes experience
welcome back to tech yes city and all
five of these GPUs I have here at the
studio and I have tested them so I will
be able to report what kind of
performance you can expect out of these
GPUs but coming in at number five is the
gtx 750ti this is pretty much the
cheapest card here in today's bunch and
reason being is because it's inexpensive
but it will also do a decent job of
entry-level 1080p gaming but if some of
the later titles for instance apex
legends you can expect this thing to
play on minimum settings and still get
decent FPS but you will have to lower
the settings completely to the bottom
but without said you'll still be out of
place csgo dota 2 and League of Legends
absolutely fine with smooth SPS at 1080p
but if you want to play some of the
latest titles and up the graphical
settings then don't expect this card to
do just that but if you want to up the
gravity little settings then let's move
on we've got the r9 270 where this
card's coming in at 53 dollars and the
good thing is about this card is if you
want to play apex legends in particular
this will do so at a native 1080p
picture so you'll still get a good
looking picture for 53 bucks and you'll
still manage to get over that magical
number of 60 FPS in this title now of
course this will play csgo League of
Legends and dota 2 a little bit better
than the 750ti
and it will play some other games like
f1 2019 this will play this at 1080p
with decent fps soo so for 53 bucks it's
not a bad choice however I did put it at
number 4 because it does require
additional power connectors and so if
you just upgrading your GPU and you've
got an older power supply for example
you may need to upgrade your power
supply in order for this GPU to work but
this now leads us to number three which
is the gtx 950 which is coming in pretty
much at the exact same price point as
the r9 270 now does trade blows in terms
of performance it just depends on the
game you're playing so you pretty much
expect 1080p on most games on low
settings with this GPU of course some of
the latest titles it may struggle to
play those games but overall it's a
decent card for 53 bucks
and now the reason this is coming in
over the r9 270 is that a lot of cases
this doesn't need any PCIe connections
and it will run straight off your
motherboard socket in that case it'll be
an easy upgrade for most
people who just want to get into PC
gaming now coming in at number two we
are cranking things up on the completely
different angle of things this is the
gtx 1660 now it's coming in at 230 US
but that does include free shipping and
all the aforementioned gravis cards in
number one also include free shipping so
that's a great benefit of getting these
cards but a 230 US you probably thinking
well I'm in the US I can get these for
220 US and the thing is rest of the
world pretty much cannot get these
prices and even in Australia this gtx
1660 is actually a good buy at its
current price point now i've tested the
colorful model here 1660 TI and that
checked out absolutely fine so the brand
of the GPUs okay the price is good and
if you live in a country where you're
paying really high import taxes you may
wish to just drop that sell or a message
and say hey can you help me out and I'm
sure they could do something for you in
order to help you out now in regards to
the performance of the GTX 1660 you can
pretty much expect all the latest and
greatest titles to play at 1080p on this
particular card with high or ultra
settings usually ultra settings it is a
card that was geared up towards 1080p
gaming in 2019 and on that note it is
pretty powerful to only being surpassed
by the GTX 1660 TI and so this now
brings us to number one the rx 570 or
the rx 580 or arts 470 this is going it
out at the moment on I'll Express for
110 US dollars and even at these prices
it's a great buy for someone who wants
to get into PC gaming and wants to play
games on high settings 1080p on pretty
much every single title out there now
the good thing about this card is is -
the one I picked out here is the
gigabyte model and I generally have had
through my experience with dealing with
rx 570s the least amount of problems
with the gigabyte models for instance
there is a sapphire model that's a
little bit cheaper but especially since
I've been buying a lot of cards that
have come from X - the Sapphire cards
around my studio here they have the
highest failure rate and some of these
cards they exhibit these corrosion
things on the fins so it'd be good to
check out if you want to get the
sapphire
model I would ask the seller to give you
a real photo of that GPU before you buy
it and if you saw a lot of corrosion on
that GPU then I'd suggest maybe staying
away from it thinking about models in my
experience are numerous out there on the
market and they have the least amount of
problems guys that about does it for the
top five lists of worldwide GPUs that
are pretty good prices at the moment of
course things change as time goes on but
as it stands if you want to get into PC
gaming depending on your budget then you
can get a decent GPU at different price
points and still be able to play without
breaking the bank and it doesn't really
matter where you live in the world now
there is another website called Taotao
but because I don't speak Chinese I
tried using an agent and when I weighed
up all the shipping costs and everything
involved in using an agent it actually
sometimes works out to be a little bit
more expensive than Aliexpress and in my
experience with all the Express you've
got buyer protection so if you get
something off this website it comes in
the mail and it's faulty you can
generally get your money back with no
problems but as for this list I'm not
taking into account local deals and if
you guys of course can get access to
some good deals locally then you'll be
able to find usually much better prices
than what I've presented here in today's
video and speaking of those local deals
for me personally recently in the last
month rx5 70's and v 80s have come up in
a bun dn't from different miners and so
I've been picking up some of these cards
extremely cheap and I've got a video
where I'm going to be doing a crossfire
of rx5 80s for you guys and also giving
away those two cards in that video so
stay tuned for that video we're gonna
compare it against some of the latest
and greatest stuff because when you're
picking up an RX 580 for like around 42
US dollars a piece that makes it
exceptionally good value for money and
that's what local deals are all about is
getting the best price performance
possible then putting together a machine
that will be unrivaled even compared to
that of the newest and best latest and
greatest deals that you can get on sales
on amazon prime day for example but
another thing I've noticed as well
besides the rx 5 70s and 580 s is the
GTX 10 series cards always keep your eye
out for a 1050 1050 Ti 1060 1070 1070 Ti
these cards seem to be getting sold
quite a bit on the marketplace where I'm
from I use Facebook marketplace or
Gumtree and so those two I do see the
occasional tenth series card pop-up for
a good price so between the polaris
cards and also pascal cards that's the
gtx ten series you can get yourself a
really good deal locally they're my two
sort of top picks for getting the best
deals without having to go on to places
like Aliexpress or eBay but of course if
you don't have access to the local deals
then today's list will definitely be
able to help you out whether you want to
build a new pc or upgrade an old one and
with that said I hope you enjoyed
today's video if you did and be sure to
hit that like button for us also I'll
leave some links in the description
below their affiliate links so if you
get one of these cards it won't cost you
anything extra and you'll be giving us a
kick back and helping us out here at
Tech yes City without a side I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon if
you're enjoying the content enough may
wish to subscribe ring that bell because
when that rx 580 video drops I'm gonna
be giving away two of those cards
worldwide too so look forward to doing
that for you and I'll see you in the
next one peace out for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
