they took your GPUs then why did they
take em and also in the near future is
there going to be suddenly a massive
influx of GPUs on the market to sell for
so cheap where you're like hey I can go
pick up a GPU
for next to nothing is that going to
happen let's discuss welcome back to
tech yestiny this is your yes-man Brian
a rockin in with a video about crypto
currencies and also the graphics card
shortage because originally there was rx
570s and five 80s for sale then they all
went out of stock and then there was now
GTF 10 60s and 1080p eyes and 1070 all
getting sold out why are these raps card
getting sold out well quite simply there
is the cryptocurrency boom now in 2017
and now this is actually nothing new to
the market in 2013 there was a big craze
with GPUs and Bitcoin mining where a lot
of people were snatching up AMD graphics
cards and using them to mine essentially
crypto currency called Bitcoin and it
was pretty profitable up until a
solution called an ASIC miner which is
an application-specific integrated
circuit which was designed specifically
for mining the Bitcoin currency was
designed came in and then it pretty much
stomped all those GPUs in terms of power
efficiency which made those graphics
cards practically worthless for mining
bitcoins and then those people then
moved over to other alternatives like
litecoin and dogecoin and then they too
basically got swarmed by asset miners
and so you had the great crash of 2014
with graphics cards and then you saw a
sudden massive influx of 7950 79 70s and
r9 to series graphics cards on the
market and now fast-forward to 2017
right now we have new crypto currencies
emerging which are very popular and the
prices of them are going up for instance
aetherium a big one out there and people
are buying graphics cards to mine these
GPUs however it is very different this
time in one aspect and that is the new
crypto currencies are essentially asset
comune in that they require a lot of
general computational power something
that a graphics card provides and
something that an asset car
do because these cryptocurrencies in a
way that they need to be mined are more
dynamic than nature than Bitcoin ever
was and now this raises a new question
of is there going to be a crash like
there was in 2014 and unfortunately in
my opinion I believe not until enough
people come in and start mining these
crypto currencies and it becomes
unprofitable for essentially a lot of
people who pay more for power than
people who pay less for power
only then will those crypto currencies
be worthless to mine and how long that
will take is anyone's guess where the
new crypto currencies emerge that are
hot and in demand is another question
all together so basically guys this
whole cryptocurrency mining boom could
be going on for years
it may be here to stay we just don't
know however one thing is certain when
you do buy a gaming graphics card you
are essentially getting some of the best
value for money in terms of GPU compute
power because the gaming graphics cards
are essentially cut down from business
graphics cards and they are sold to
people who want to play games
and unlike CPUs they actually have a lot
more compute power at their disposal and
unlike other gaming products for
instance gaming peripherals which charge
an extra X amount of money over a
standard product just for the gaming
title gaming graphics cards are in a
unique position and because of that they
are in high demand so unfortunately this
video is a little bit negative in the
outlook for the PC gaming community and
unfortunately if you are coming into
building your first PC and you want to
join the PC gaming community it sucks at
them over because not only is the
graphics cards getting sold out and the
prices of them going up but also things
like ddr4 memory is going up as well so
really the only solutions at the moment
is you can go for a use price
performance PC or you can buy things
like the 1050 Ti which is currently
going for retail price and is actually a
very good band-aid until you can afford
something on still Sonic comes back in
stock at a reasonable price
there are also some GT X 1080 still for
sale at decent prices however I believe
that they will be snapped up as well so
if you are looking at buying a high-end
PC and 10 70's and 1080p eyes are
selling out where you are then you might
want to pull the trigger quickly on
their GTX 1080 and also just like the 10
70's and 1080i I believe the 10 80s will
soon be sold out in my
pi√±on however there is another rumor
going around that people are simply
selling out the GTX 10 70s because
they're selling their RX 5 80s and 5 70s
and buying those graphics cards and I
believe that is not the case I believe
that's actually some crypto currencies
out there at the moment they're actually
really good to mine on Nvidia graphics
cards hence why now the sudden demand
for Nvidia graphics cards and the
selling out of those cards has commenced
however some good news to come out of
this video is that I will soon be
starting to join that mining craze and
putting some of my samples to use and
start mining these crypto currencies and
possibly make a video for you guys as
honestly you guys just like me are kind
of early in the trend when I look back
and look at Bitcoin I was joining in
when I knew about Bitcoin it was
actually on a trend upwards you guys are
joining into the cryptocurrency you're
on a trend that's going up if you get in
now you can actually make some money
even if you're on one or two graphics
cards there's still a little bit of
money to be made here so join the trend
early and as always the trend is your
friend and I look forward to giving you
guys another tech video very soon peace
out for now bye and also don't forget to
hit that like button and subscribe up
down
oh yes also one more thing I didn't
touch on in the video if you guys see a
youtuber or someone else with like a 5
or 10 GPU setup
don't go hating on him here is really
not the problem here
the problem is this is like literally
single entities buying up thousands of
graphics cards at a time these places
have like dedicated factories to mine
these crypto currencies they're the guys
who are actually selling out the
graphics card anyway guys catch you
later bye they took your GT e--'s</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
