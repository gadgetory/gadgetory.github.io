clean my motherboards and my GPUs and
also I'm going to do some tests before
and after to see how much of a
difference this really makes so today
we're going to be cleaning this graphics
card down and this motherboard with
brake cleaner and CRC five five six well
it's going to use alcohol it's going to
be my usual method so what you want to
do is you want to take the battery out
of this motherboard here so there's no
current going through it and then you
want to start taking off the heatsink
so let's start taking off all these heat
sinks and then we'll get on to the next
step now also before I start taking off
heat sinks and stuff until I actually
want to clean the socket out I just put
a CPU in there and all this allows me to
do is just make sure that I'm not going
to bend any pins when I'm like being
rough with this
as we pulled this heatsink off here this
is the main heatsink covering the vrm
and also the Northbridge here on the x58
board now this pad actually doesn't
really need to be replaced it's still in
decent condition though if it is bad you
can then just get it all off so I'll
actually do it just quickly for this
video so just take it all off and then
we're going to replace it with a pad
that we got off eBay for like a dollar
now this is the Northbridge heat sink
right here and usually a lot of the
times with x58 this can get really
crusty so I've got an old heat sink
sorry an old socket cover here which is
actually hard plastic and it does a
really good job of getting off this crap
around here so you just literally get
you know in there get it all off and
we're ready after that we'll be ready to
apply the thermal paste now you may wish
to use an alcohol wipe to help you in
this process
so now we can see here that this
heatsink is pretty much really crusty so
this is the final resort here this is
getting a little sanding block this is
like an old one that's been used quite a
bit as sixty grit and we're just going
to literally go ham on
okay so that one took a little bit
longer than usual but after you're done
you just scrape it back with your
fingernail and just make sure of the
smooth
look at much better now you can see the
actual writing they're still on the
heatsink so we've gotten through to the
surface now and now we're ready to do
the Southbridge so with the Southbridge
you generally don't have to worry too
much this arm they generally never get
hot so just a quick a quick clean here
you see here they even use a different
type of thermal paste because it just
really doesn't matter a whole lot on the
Southbridge so for this next part we're
going to loosen up all these screws on
the back here usually you do this with
the little screwdriver the big ones
usually don't fit so let's get on with
that
all right so once you've undone all the
screws the graphics card should come off
like this and then you just unplug that
a four pin connector there on the fan
and now you're looking at what is
essentially the fan plastic shroud there
which is separated from the heatsink
which is great because we can just clean
this down without whole wipes we don't
want to put brake cleaner on this
because it's plastic and this here will
just clean this down with brake cleaner
get all the dust out of the fins there
and then this here we will also be
cleaning down with brake cleaner as well
so upon pulling off the memory heat
sinks and the vrm heatsink here these
are actually pretty decent I've just got
to get all the dust off that to make
them look pretty good but otherwise
they're in pretty decent Nick the only
main thing here of course is the GPU die
which has this pretty crap heatsink
pasted on there and it looks terrible so
we're going to clean that off both the
GPU heatsink and the die then we'll put
on some new heatsink pastes so let's get
on with that also I'm going to quickly
take these thermal pads off before I do
this and now one good thing about these
old-school cards is that they're just
made so well you can see these thermal
pads are still in pretty good damn
condition for considering how old they
are which they're letters cards like one
how many years old now so I'm just going
to put them back on this one and then we
are going to clean this graphics card
so for this next part we're just going
to get some brake cleaner this is this
stuff here and then essentially just
hose down the parts
okay so now is the next step we've just
cleaned it down with brake cleaner so if
the brake cleaner didn't take some stuff
off it would have loosened it up so the
alcohol wipes will get that stuff off
but it will also take the brake cleaner
off which is slightly corrosive so we
want to get that off as well and so
we're just going to give it a nice
alcohol wiping down
[Laughter]
okay for this next step you want to make
sure that your motherboard and you grab
his card or whatever you're spraying
down is completely dry before you
continue on to the next step now you can
just leave this stuff you know sitting
somewhere overnight or you can put your
heater on low and that'll dry it up
really quickly and probably take like 20
minutes to dry everything up that's what
I'm doing here so don't put your heater
on high you don't want to destroy your
 but you know just put on low and
let all this stuff dry up and then we'll
be ready for the next step all right so
now it's time to put the graphics card
back together and the motherboard we'll
start with a graphics card and just will
put the vrm heatsink back on now this is
the stuff that I use called CRC five
five six now this will act as a
something that will make it look
cosmetically awesome when it's finished
but also actors are protected and
protect the components work is like a
layer so yeah it's got two fold purpose
I really love working with this stuff
can highly recommend it and it won't
short-circuit anything so let's get on
with it
you
so this next part we're going to put
some thermal paste on the what looks
like the internal heat spread off this
actually looks like they've done an IHS
on the die which is kind of weird I mean
I would deal it it if it was a thermal
paste that they used underneath but even
then it would take me a while I think on
some of this big so I'm just gonna for
what it's worth I'm just going to do a
quick spread job here now a lot of
people are like look dude you should be
doing the pee method it's like it
doesn't really matter
honestly you know I've tested this stuff
time and time again this method is so
consistent you see here I'm just
literally getting a last bit down and
now we've got an even layer smooth layer
going to work really well for the task
so this next part we are going to put
down the thermal pad here on the vrm
heat sink and it's very easy we just
line that up and we cut off enough there
I mean that should be about right so we
just cut that off and then we can put it
on
all right for this last part we're just
gonna get some CRC five five six and
just essentially just spray it on give
it a light coat in there then just
polish it down off without
there's
people are
so there we go guys there's the finished
product right there for both the gravis
card and the motherboard you see they
kind of look like they're brand-new now
not only that I'm very confident in how
they will perform as well so this is my
method and let's get on with the final
test now for the gravis cards see how
that performs
yeah
Oh God
we're going to look at some before and
after temperatures when I tested the
gravis card just straight before I
cleaned it it was getting 74 degrees
after I ran a full benchmarking UniGene
Valley now this was at 26 degrees
ambient temperatures with the custom fan
profile set to 70% now after we clean
this gravis card we got with a drumroll
64 degrees that's right we've got to
tend to read rhop just out of changing
the thermal paste and cleaning up this
graphics card that's all we did and
we've got a 10 degree drop which is
freaking huge and this is apples to
apples both times the temperatures in
this room was 26 degrees Celsius and at
both times the fan speeds were set to
70% so we've got apples to apples 10
degree drop freaking huge now another
interesting thing about this GPU is that
Nvidia back in this day went with an
internal heat spreader and they decided
to do what Intel's doing nowadays and
that is glue it on with thermal paste in
between the die and the heat spreader
and I'm sure if I deleted this thing the
temperatures would have dropped that
much more as well though something like
deleting a GPU it's kind of it would be
a very tedious process something that I
don't want to do on a 25-dollar graphics
card even though I know you guys would
love to see it I just really don't have
time at the moment to chop apart a
25-dollar GPU and also risk breaking it
in the process because with the CPUs I'm
used to doing the vise method as opposed
to the GPU I don't really know how to
tackle that one I mean I actually did
try hacking it up with my art knife and
they gave up after like five minutes
because it would have taken me a mammoth
amount of time to do it so there we have
it cleaning up your PC parts I can
highly recommend it not only do you get
a cosmetic enhancement but you also get
a massive performance enhancement too
now with that Northbridge on the
motherboard I've actually tested this in
the past and that's made a big
difference as well and it's actually
funny with this motherboard lineup the
x58 lineup a lot of people were actually
taking the heatsinks off as soon as they
bought the product because they used
cheap thermal paces you can see that was
very hard that stuff is terrible so I
don't even need to test that
tell you guys that the results would be
a lot better though that's about it for
me today guys if you enjoyed this video
then you know what to do hit that like
button if you have any questions or
comments about cleaning up your PC parts
or anything in general if you just want
to tell me something drop it in the
comment section below and I'll read it
and if you haven't already subscribe to
tacky air city and I'll catch you in the
next enthusiasts tech video very soon
peace out for now bye you've got to get
an Apple then you got to get another
Apple then you go to compare them
head-to-head that's gonna bruise
damn like you know like the dapples are
expensive
you
Brian you've got to go check out this
guy's video he shows you how to spread
thermal paste with that insane amount of
pressure that he's putting on that PG a
socket there and if you put it on an LG
I saga with that much pressure your
motherboard yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
