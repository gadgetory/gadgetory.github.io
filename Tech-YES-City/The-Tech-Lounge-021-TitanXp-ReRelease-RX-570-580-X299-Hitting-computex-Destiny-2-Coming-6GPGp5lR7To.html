lounge and i'm joined by kev from tech
showdown how you doing man was it a
great Brian how about you whoo it's been
busy it's been busy and we have talked
about a lot yeah just been crazy the
last way I guess the last but ever since
risin was released it has been crazy
guys so it has been off the chain and
yeah I just haven't stopped and I know a
lot of people want to see like this this
question a lot of people want to see
like the vlog styles more that you stuff
and once the time freeze up I promise
I'll be getting a lot more of that
content out too and I do stick to my
promises guys don't worry how that you
did what are you doing in the last week
eyes has been crazy you're just trying
to basically get through a backlog of
some of the videos that I needed to get
out and then obviously open myself up
for rising five so i just finished
building my rising five test rig
yesterday and that video will be going
up today hopefully so that was quite
interesting we'll talk about race and
five a bit later on and today but yeah
it's it's going to be really good going
forward I got a lot of really awesome
videos planned I think you guys are
going to be really excited well the good
thing is now with this release is
there's going to be both the four core
and the six core release so after this
we can kind of not have like no more
hype coming out it's like here's the
results here's how the six call before
here's our the four core performs and
the just based off risin seven the lower
skews the cheapest cues they're going to
pretty much be the same thing it just
depends on overclocks so we can't say oh
my god this is going to be so much
better price performance when it'll
probably overclock the same as the 66
1600 will overclock the same as a 1600 X
and whatnot you know what i mean so yeah
i'm hurt ya I'm just because I want to
get back like verizon's has been crazy
man the Internet's what's been going
insane it's been honestly it's just been
like a heap of it's been fun it's been
like good and bad like it's been fun but
then this has been all this hike
hype and then like the craziness yeah
it's been a lot of craziness out there
so yeah you you and adored TV had that
that thing Ryan you sorted it all out
which is really good he's a good man so
yeah yeah mean Jim soil so so we have
our disagreements but um you know we we
talk to each other and we both made a
video basically saying sorry for what we
did and me for making accusations and
them for reacting very harshly so we are
but we started talking to each other
quite a bit actually um actually get
along really well so yes he's a really
nice guy and it was good to sort
everything out with them and and talk to
each other and hopefully we might do a
collab together or something going
forward because we actually do get along
really well so yeah I've been talking to
him quite a bit lately yes nice guy yeah
well I guess thing man i'll never judge
a man that I haven't met in real life
you're not i mean so that's a that's
just me brother so you should yells like
yet dude you shouldn't shouldn't have
done that one but it's all good saw
water under the bridge bro you learned
your lesson so you move on and it's
speaking of moving on so you look at
that Segway speaking of moving on we've
got here the Titan XP and now people
have asked me to pump up the text
enlarge it so we can I mean this is I
pumped it up a little bit we can go a
little bit crazier than that so we can
we can go all the way in there we go now
hopefully people can read it that's a
little bit too much that's that I guess
if everyone's yeah so do you want to
talk about tiny XP rerelease first or do
you want me to talk about first is um
yes so I'll basically i think there's
called a lot of people of god it's
firstly the name so it's going to be the
official name is actually tighten x with
the lowercase P now that's confusing
because the last Titan X the official
name was just tied an X and the one
before that was tiny X that's the mascot
at the Maxwell and the Pascal but
because people we didn't want to confuse
people or when we were talking about it
we
and by we I mean people in the tech
community added the P on there so it's
unofficial name for the second time next
was the time XP now when video has just
made that even more confusing by making
this one's official name the Titan XP so
it's just so confusing if you're a
retailer and someone came in to buy one
of these or maybe they already had one
and they want to know the difference
they're just going to be so confused I'm
trying to buy one so the naming scheme
for I just don't get it's not that hard
to change a name you could make it if
you want to stay with the eggs I thought
the Titan XXX would be awesome you know
XXX you enjoy need you and your porn
really poor basically it sure sounds
badass though time XXX though that
sounds awesome um yeah and it makes
sense as well because it's the third
time next so there's three X's I just
thought that would be okay but the but I
just I don't get it anyways moving past
the name ah it's got more cooter cause
you're going up to 3840 ah the memories
been bumped up as well and yeah it's
just add the clock speeds gone up a
little bit but in general it's it's just
a bump up it's sort of a rebrand of
sorts so there's that side of it again
they're going to be charging a premium
price for it which I think also upset a
lot of people considering the price
point now that the 1080 TI is coming in
um which the performance between the two
I can't imagine will be very big so yeah
this will be interesting I mean it's got
more cuda cores than the the 1080 TI but
memory wise there it's got a bit more
bandwidth as well so that will help but
will people actually be willing to pay
that extra money over the 1080 ti
or this Titan XP the new one and i'm not
sure if they will now nvidia have also
done a lot of marketing stuff seeing
this one's for deep learning and things
like that which okay and as a mac
support now as well so that's good i
suppose but yeah not really I I think a
lot of people are a little bit
disappointed by this and I think it is
just nvidia trying to extend the
lifespan of pascal for about as long as
they possibly can before volta you know
what do you think oh yeah right yeah so
I just think like they should have just
caught the most logical name for this
would be the Titan x3 right that I would
of course no confusion put XXX bit of a
porno named ty next to you like okay
this jewel dpu GPU tight next three
would have been fine I don't know why
the Internet's ranting so much though I
think it's an over rent I've never
recommended a Titan before in my life I
probably won't be recommending one based
on its price performance which isn't
that good then it's been going crazy I
mean look if you bought a Titan X the
original XP you've had that for eight
months you've had those bragging rights
for eight months eight months is pretty
long in the GPU world and then they've
read every re-released it and you've now
got ten percent more performance pretty
much that's what I'd guess to me ten
percent more for eight months that's and
that's really not bad i mean you're not
screwing over the original Titan XP
buyers I don't think they're getting
screwed over they're not they're getting
in for when they buy that graphics card
so ah yeah that's just mostly I just
would agree i think i think it's just
over there was an ovary a be able just
ranting left right and center is like is
in video guys they make money that they
do business Titan Titan the especially
the Titan brand is the brand that is the
rip-off brand it's like no two ways
about if they did this on a 1080i and
then release the 1080 ti2 or something
yeah I could understand because we're
gamers man we like that price
performance in you okay you're screwing
over the original 1080i owners but on
that note I've actually just tested this
out here just review the Auris this
thing is
so damn good like wow it's going to
pretty much this thing out of the box
will pretty much be the same speeds as a
Titan XP this new one it's I'm going to
talk about in the review it's got the
power limits like up to one hundred and
fifty percent so it's much higher than
the founders edition and you'll see in
the benchmarks i'm going to show because
i've done all the benchmarking I've done
them after you actually cut the video
and stuffing she go to make the video
and uploaded which takes ages but it is
performing a good ten percent ahead in a
lot of cases against my founders edition
with the accelero cooler on it in games
it's just a beast the power targets
there when I'm looking at the figures
post benchmarking I'm getting up to like
a hundred and forty percent 141 percent
power target being hit in games so that
is a real limiting factor on the
original founders edition card so the
Auris is legit like it's only an extra
50 USD over the 700 USD founders edition
card so it's bend it's just the cream of
the crop and that's going to pretty much
be the same speeds as a twelve hundred
dollar cut being just released now so
that would be the car to get if you're
an enthusiast of course you're going to
be using up and it not much more power
considering the titan XP is going to
have those extra unlocked cause but yeah
i think you're going to be getting your
money's worth for sure if you buy those
bend 10 ATT is there going to be awesome
for overclockers so hopefully nvidia
doesn't take too much notice of this and
doesn't nerf the next TI variant that
comes out that who knows ya know exactly
so i think that's really good and I
think that's what everyone was looking
forward to and the fact that these non
referenced natt eyes are just going to
be ridiculously powerful I'm going to be
doing showdowns with them very soon I
have seen quite a few of them already
around so yeah that are we really really
fun to do but these are really powerful
cards and that's what I mean I mean you
you summed it up very well well yeah
will people still buy this new time in
XP when you could just buy one of these
really good model non-reference
natt is and just overclocked them like
crazy and because remember that tide and
line up they only you can only get them
in the reference there's only the
founders edition that's not like there's
non-reference versions for you to buy so
obviously with the non referenced natt
is they'll have all the upgraded
components and all the other fun stuff
on them that allow you to do those
massive overclocks and yeah I think
performance wives it'll be exactly the
same or very close to it so it does beg
the question the video wouldn't release
it unless they thought it would sell but
well weist whilst being quieter and
cooler as well these aftermarket cool is
this one here is a 1 kilo cooler on its
own like a detach it from the PCB and
backplate it's like 1020 grams it's huge
actually monster of a cooler reminds me
of the Lightning days I like that that
cooler was one of my favorite so a Titan
XP but speaking of re-releases will go
into this the RX 518 570 these are
pretty much exactly the same thing a
rerelease of your graphics cards your rx
470 and 480 yet why isn't the internet
going stupid over this yeah I mean this
is I guess because it was I'm not sure
I'm always may be expected oh man this
gpu-z shot like seriously that it's like
someone had this on the lowest res model
they could find and then took it on the
lowest res camera they could find I
haven't seen it like it's being
compressed a whole bunch of times this
is just something that's being
regurgitated like a rear ender like four
times over I haven't seen a screenshot
this bad in a long time like 10 yards
that's pretty shocking say yeah this is
quite um
yeah the only real changes that we can
see so GPU wise it's exactly the same
that 582 the 480 will be the same and
the 572 the 470 will be the same in
terms of the amount of cause or MD
putted stream processors team use wraps
you know everything's the same so
basically always seeing going from the
480 to the 580 is a clock speed bump up
so the 1266 reference speed for the 480
gets bumped up to 1340 and so that's
pretty good there that's it that's a
decent jump up nearly a hundred
megahertz and then the face the 470 to
the 57 year this is actually we will
probably see a bit more of a difference
now the clock speeds have only gone up
slightly from 1206 to 12 24 the main
difference here is that the memories
gone up from 60 600 megahertz to 7,000
megahertz that's a smart decision that's
actually pretty it's that's pretty
pissed week for a jump actually that
that is the domain is still less still
small it's not like what we saw this is
definitely much less than if you
remember back to the 200 series we jump
from the 292 90 x 2 319 390 eggs and
that actually changed GPUs kind of they
change the name it went from Hawaii to
Grenada and basically the Grenada G
views were just a bit better bend you
could get a bit better of a clock Salem
they used a bit less power TDP went from
300 watts to 275 and there's a few
things but the main benefit there was
the memory jumped up a lot that is like
a thousand megahertz jump up and memory
speed and also the memory doubled from
four to a so as we got we're even jump
benchmarks wise you got about ten
percent more to like when I was looking
at benchmarks this looks like five
percent at best that's like it's a
pretty looking like a pretty pissed week
rebrand I mean come on the internet
warriors if you're going to blast in
video for the re-release of the tine XP
which is giving you more won't you blast
this where's your videos you know like
it's it just seems like it's just okay
let's hate on in video
nvidia makes money their business but
this is the exact same thing a bit worse
in my opinion because it's a mainstream
card yet you know people this just goes
ignore day as it's no problems I mean I
don't really care about it that's
exactly I don't bother ranting but just
point now just point out you know
no I get what you're saying and it is
exactly right so maybe the non reference
models of this these are the reference
specs we'll take that even higher in
terms of clock speeds and stuff like
that maybe you'll see a big jump up kind
of reminds me of the 280x a over the
7970 it was that same GPU the Tahiti but
you got a the toy DX was basically
gigahertz edition 7970 so yeah that'll
be interesting the only other
interesting thing I saw was at the RX
480 the reference models if you guys
remember back here just the single 6 pin
power connector the reference by baby
will have an 8 pin power connector now
you may remember back to the power type
issues if you go through a 6-pin you get
75 watts and you go through the PCI
that's another 75 and there was some
problems there so it looks like AMD of
sort of just decided to go with an eight
pen and just completely you know so you
don't need to worry about that so maybe
the power limits wise at least on the
reference models might be a bit better
but all the non reference weight than
anyway so I don't really think it'll
make too much of a difference unless
you're upgrading from a reference for e2
reference 580 maybe there's like one guy
out that's going to do that only very
curious to see if the putting a 6-pin in
this will work still because I did it on
my RX for some of those RX for 70s I've
done it on another graphics card as well
I think back in Japan I had one with an
a penis like I tried another 12 and get
all those cards six pins were working in
the 8-pin slots now you just plug in a
6-pin and the graphics card still works
I'm really curious to see if this rx 580
will work with just a 6-pin I've got a
feeling it will it probably will yeah
you're right it's just kind of begs the
question of why would anyone ever do
that because it's easy enough just to
put an eight
but if you could get the six pin in you
could probably get the apron and so it
would just be there to give you that bit
extra I mean a lot of people did
complain about the power limitations on
the reference for 80s but the non
reference for 80s were a very good step
up from the reference for 80 so yeah
I'll be interested but i mean i'll be
doing a lot of showdowns with these 5
80's and five 70s as they're coming out
with a few new and the bullet partners
making new colors and new models for
them as well upgraded models and so
that'll be interesting also i think it
will breathe a little bit of light into
it if you're a current 480 owner or
something i doubt there will be any
reason to upgrade but if you were so on
in the market for one of those mid-level
that value for money tear graphics card
then waiting around for these new ones
to come out especially price-wise
they're the same yeah you could probably
get yourself a good deal or the fact
that many retailers will be probably
clearing out there for 80 and 470 stock
you might be able to get a good
non-reference for 80 on special or
something if they're just trying to
clear up this stop that's what i'll sing
in a 470 or 480 on special to be the way
to go I mean I loved the 470 I've been a
big fan of the 470 since it was released
it's a really kick-ass budget value card
it just kicks absolutely ask for what it
is four gigabytes of RAM is cut in my
opinion that fergie bouts of vram is
perfect for 1080p gaming where it sweet
spot is coupled with the noun G 45-60 as
another reason why like a lot of the
times when I'm hunting for use parts it
is this no point in buying some of these
parts because the new parts coming in
are just bringing the competition so
hard ever since the G 45-60 was released
in the art for sixth of RX 470 gtx 1060
when these cards were released it's just
like a massive shake up to the youth
cheap especially the youth GPU section
and now with the G 45-60 the new cpu
CPUs and stuff like that so crazy crazy
crazy but here we go we got the next
article here risin five so we don't know
any details until the NDA lifts but I've
actually saw this YouTube video where
this guy just mean didn't give a
about
da he was showing the bias pics and
everything I'd have to find the video
again but he was just overclocking he
goes like 3.8 goods and he was comparing
it against some of the lowest skew i5
and i7 s and I 705 I think and yeah it
was doing pretty well it was doing
really well so we've got confirmation
here the risin 5 can be overclocked to 4
gigahertz so that's looking like it's
pretty much in line with the horizon r7s
as well a lot of those are hitting
around for 3.92 4 gigahertz cinders to
be the topping out points there yeah but
what about you with your cpu's I mean
I've found about yet 3.9 with my 1700 x
2 4.0 25 so it's pretty it's pretty good
late that the margins are tight like
there's not a wild variance oh yeah yeah
that's for sure no I got full gear it's
out of um when I finished my rows and
five test rig I tracked the risin seven
seventeen hundred and just to make sure
everything get everything sorted in
preparation for Rosen 5 and I ever got
that guy just because why not just to
see how much I could get out of it and
just like every single other one i
jested i got 4 gigahertz out of it and
it wouldn't do 4.1 no matter what i did
put the voltage up to 1.45 and it just
wouldn't happen so yeah there that they
just seem to like to sit around that I
would say for the usual owner if you've
got a rise and 7 or you think about
buying one expect hope for 4 gigahertz
that's kind of what most people should
be getting but you may end up with one
that can only go to 3.9 if you're really
unlucky you'll get one that only goes to
like 3 point 8 45 but yeah I think I'm I
think this is what a lot of us expected
out of reisen 5 so that the overclocks
are not that spectacular by comparison
to say kb lake but we will just have to
see because price point wise it is very
aggressive to price points these are
coming in at and i think the other thing
that's really important is how the
testing is done for rice and face so I
can only see
speak for myself but I have really
thought about this and because of issues
with Nvidia's Direct X 12 drivers and
rising I decided to not do any Direct X
12 benchmarking when I do my raison five
showdowns because I'll be running the
GTX 1080 which is the most powerful
graphics card I have available to me the
reason why we run these powerful cards
is because we don't we want to eliminate
that GP bottleneck so I won't be doing
any Direct X 12 testing it'll just be
Abdullah sleep productivity testing like
normal cinebench and break all that fun
stuff 3dmark but also gaming and all the
games will just be direct x 11 to make
sure there's no funny business going on
with in regards to nvidia's Direct X 12
drivers keep it nice and fair for you
well I just I honestly I don't believe
in DX 12-year falken is so good like
doom showed what Volcom was really about
I actually played through doom with
Vulcan on I love it it's it's good every
time i boot up to him I'm like changing
it to Vulcan I haven't played any games
yet where I've wanted to switch to dx12
every time I turn it on I get crashing
or just freaking stuttering that's not
there on dx11 I don't like why test the
game if it's running like on dx12
it doesn't make any sense so I'm kind of
with you on that like I won't be doing
much DX 12 testing unless people really
want to see it and even then it's like
okay who's using dias 12 at the moment
on what game because I love to see a
game admittedly I haven't tested every
game on TX 12 yet but all the games are
teslim TX 12 after playing on it for a
couple of minutes I've just reverted
back to desk 11 I couldn't wait to
revert back because again even both an
AMD and nvidia graphics card didn't
matter on the graphs card just ran like
 on both so that's something with
dx12 at the moment I'm kind of really
waiting to see the real benefits of dx12
volk and we already know that runs
awesome that's like I just wish they
would focus on Vulcan instead of dx12
I'd love ya I mean we would like to see
that a bit more um but yeah that the
Rosen five testing will be very
interesting i think also the other thing
i change this time was if you guys watch
my last showdowns with rose and seven i
was mainly running the memory at 2133
megahertz on both systems the Intel and
AMD system this time around I'm going to
be running 2933 memory on the risin
system and probably like 2800 or
whatever I can get on the Intel system
and I think that will be quite good as
well because a lot of people are talking
now about how the memory speed the high
memory speed really benefits rising
because the infinity fabric so um yeah
that'll be something else i'm doing this
time as well as making sure all my rides
and five testing is with the memory at
the decently high clock speed and so
there's basically this is going to be
favorable well not favorable but i would
say on it makes rising I'm trying to
make this as fair as possible and
playing to all the strengths of rising
so having the fast memory no dx12
testing and all those things and we'll
see how it comes out then with the
comparisons that i'll be doing to
certain I sevens and I fives yeah
absolutely it should be testing all four
rice and chips just look at this this
was from hard ocp they were using level
low level 5 load lake calibration I
think a lot of times that's the lowest
setting especially you know I recommend
using the highest level or the level 1
below the highest because the vedra you
don't want that so that their 1.45 volt
might be dropping down to 1.38 1.37 and
that's right about where three-point not
3975 or whatever 3.97 5 gigahertz or 4
gigahertz is about sweet spotted so they
might have been able to get a higher if
they were using level 1 at 1.45 volt so
I think that just pointing that out if
you guys are overclocking always make
sure you and you've got a decent power
supply of course level five is if you've
got a pretty bad power supply because
some of those power supplies they just
they're not that's stable in their
ripple and whatnot so you load them up
and then they just go above like yeah
the 12 volts actually pushing out 12.2
or whatever it's just their terrible
power supplies and so that's why that
was always there that spec that standard
was the counter act pretty poor gear but
nowadays with power supplies being so
good and motherboard VRMs being so good
you can just bump that to level 1 or
level 2 and you're still going to have
just a smooth power delivery all the way
there's not going to the sooner be no
spikes per se so that's where that speck
was always it is so just pointed that
out there um X 2 99 we're going to
change move straight into it because we
want to get on the q18 to don't make it
to longer show even though a lot of
people miss the show thanks guys so
bench dot life the Chinese website this
is the chinese website and they're known
for very accurate intel related leaks
have said that x 2 99 is coming for
computex that's what they're saying yeah
so thief so instead of being early
August it's going to be the fourth week
of june so looks like intel has moved it
up but quite yeah wait a bit which is
interesting for them i don't think i've
seen them do that before well it's gonna
it's like it'll be showcased at computex
but it looks like it'll hit in the
fourth week Joe they're saying june
nineteen to twenty fifth so they're
actually call it sky like x processes to
yeah I mean I'm not too interested in
this at the moment like I'm really
looking out if there's an intel cpu that
i'm looking forward to would be that six
core mainstream cpu because it's going
to have the latest IPC it's going to be
six cores hopefully overclock better
then its other six chords the 6800 k and
its predecessor the 58 20k that's the
one I'm looking out for really looking
forward to that one to see how it goes
if it's a wild six core if it's just a
tame six core I want the wild
how about you keV yeah i mean i'll be
looking for sure and obviously both of
us will be doing a lot of testing unless
those six scores i mean the thing is
this is where Intel really needs to hit
back because risin decimated broad well
II basically i mean i run Broadwell ii
and i run rise is this note yeah there's
no two ways about if someone came to me
right now I was like yeah I'm buying I'm
going to be building a rig for
productivity and gaming which cpu should
I buy I would you say rice rice and
seven for sure because Y in terms of
just pure value for money it's just so
much of a better deal um so yeah for
sure that the I feel like Intel is a
little bit panicked by risin I think
they didn't expect it maybe to be as
good as it was so now they're moving up
the release date because it's decimated
the Broadway Lee line so badly i mean
the sales must have gone off a cliff now
um they're probably going to be trying
to bring this up so it can launch on
this new platform with i'm guessing a
whole bunch of new stuff we don't really
know too much here and obviously with
these new cpus that should be I mean
it's going to depend on the price point
um if Intel's going to stay with these
very high prices that we've obviously
gotten used to with say haswell-e and
broadway lee then I have really don't
know how you know how well it's going to
sell because there's rice and sevens are
just such good value if they're going to
bring these out with these high price
tags again um it's going to be a very
hard sell to try sell a six-course guy
like x cpu or kb like x cpu and against
an equal rising seven that might be a
hundred dollars two hundred dollars
cheaper depending on where you live
which might have even better performance
still so they're going to have to be
pretty smart about this i think the
price the prices will have to be much
more competitive this time around now
that they actually of competition
and yeah I think that'll be very
interesting there but the X 2 99 the
platform will probably be the most
interesting thing that I think a lot of
us will be looking at in terms of what's
new because I mean x 99 has been around
such a long time now and that this would
be really cool so yeah that's what I'm
looking forward to the most the sky like
a I'm looking forward to seeing how it
overclocks that's the simplest thing for
me it fit overclocks well if you can get
a 6-core in an eight-core up to pretty
high frequencies much higher than
brought Willie if I can GU has Willie
frequencies and I've actually be pretty
good for them especially for people
looking for that extra edge there's I
know a lot of people out there who want
to get the extra productivity out of
their systems and they don't mind
spending the extra money they're writing
it off on tax or whatever doesn't matter
the business expense they want to do
business faster and better they can do
it with the better productivity so if
you use them or not so yes risin offers
amazing value for money but again people
are always looking for the best
regardless doesn't matter what industry
you're in so is it going to be the best
there is it going to be just a little
bit better than what's out there that's
what I'm looking forward to seeing I
honestly think I hope they don't pull
another broad well II and that you can't
overclock these things that I because
the 58 20k versus the 6800 k that was a
joke in my opinion here you had one cpu
that was hitting 4.5 4.6 gigahertz then
they released the 6800 k and it's only
getting 4.2 4.3 it's kind of like what
what's the point of this cpu especially
for enthusiasts for enthusiasts it's
like wow okay my 58 20k is getting
higher overclocks is not even worth
getting the 6800 k you know I picked up
some of they picked up a bargain on him
658 20k go for 250 bucks when the
60-hour k was released so it was like
okay this was awesome I'm about yes yes
I think that's a very very good point so
if these skylights gave you like chips
are really good overclockers as well as
having the IPC improvements and
everything over broad well II our broad
well
general I think it'll be quite good it's
just again they will yeah this will be
very very interesting and this is the
reply that I think a lot of people will
be looking forward to in terms of how
Intel replies to rising and this will be
the one everybody's watching however if
if they're rushing it now if you guys
can remember back to an ex 99 first
launched I can remember back then and
there was a lot of issues back then sort
of like what we've seen now with x3 70s
and B 3 50's some of them ah and if
they're rushing x 2 99 and it comes out
and we have a repeat of x 99 then that's
going to be a little bit annoying to a
lot of people as well so let's hope they
don't rush it too hard and throw these
out um when they're not honestly low a
lot of pretty a lot of people bleh max
99 on intel i'd say that more souls on
the board partners i mean i tried the
asrock board stable as other board
partners were having real big problems I
don't think yeah a lot of people just
blame Intel for that sleep know if as
Walker getting it right and the other
guys are getting it wrong then doesn't
it kind of the owners for a little bit
on the motherboard manufacturers here so
I nothing but bliss after i got an
asrock bought in and started with 58 20k
i was like bang this is really good and
you got to remember that was the first
release of ddr4 memory too that was on
ddr4 memory first came out so true yeah
yeah that's what actually going to segue
into the next article here so the next
generation of ddr5 memory is going to be
released to actually understand is going
to be finalized in 2018 but as the
article points out ddr4 was actually
finalized in 2012 and it didn't go
mainstream until 2015 Bertram actually
2014 with x99 so that was when ddr4 so
this is that two-year delay so we could
see ddr5 based on that if we're going to
do historical analysis here we'd say
that ddr5 memory is going to come out in
2020 so that's quite a long way away as
three years away it's like when reisen
was first
Zen was first touted in the public in
2014 it was like oh my god AMD's making
this that lovers ages ago yeah you know
oh man that was crazy three years ago I
don't three years ago oh yeah banas
being a sucker that's all been a soccer
three years ago a little bit besides
that I think I think this week why
interesting yeah I'm ezzy article says
guys there's no relation to gddr5 if
that's what you might have been thinking
and but there is there is you take away
the G and then you've got ddr5 bro so
yeah this would be this I mean I I think
not many people I would maybe I speak
for myself they're beasts I'm not like
waiting for ddr5 I think ddr4 has is
still very very solid um I think the
main thing I think people looking
forward to is pcie four point oh um that
would be really good we actually thought
it might be coming out with X 2 99 I
doubt that it seems like it would be too
quick for it and but probably after that
we can start expecting it maybe towards
the end of this year definitely next
year and that will be very very cool to
see because we've been on pcie 3.0 for
when did that come out can't even
remember yeah being up for a while now I
I just want to say do you take away the
g which is gangster and then you've got
dank doll we dug ram 5 that's what
stanza so I never knew that thanks for
this is rich kidding a lot that was
great so sorry I lost focus before what
were you what were you alluding to
alluding to no it's just saying I'm
do you think that's what are you looking
forward to pcie four-point-oh by
comparison to something like this like I
think that'll be much more interesting
going forward yeah pcie for would be
more interesting actually they're both
good they're both going to be pretty
good they're both upgrades pca before
i'm more looking forward to it for the
mainstream platforms where we do have
limited amounts of PCI Express ports
like for instance with my Rosen 5 my
card is now on pcie 3.0 16 8 speed so
kind of like mmm if it was busy a
four-point-oh you wouldn't have to worry
because you're doubling up on the speeds
again so that is something I'm looking
forward to anything is always a better
thing of course as PC is three point 0
16 is 16 X is just perfect you're not
going to saturate that for quite a long
time though the way things are going
with forty percent gains every year
thirty five percent gains every year two
years time you could probably see
yourself saturating that maybe I mean I
don't know I've have to just whether you
could do the test you do the test right
but again higher speeds is always a
better thing so bring it on ddr5 bring
it on pcie four-point-oh bring it on
looking forward to them there always are
upgrades I'm wonder what they're going
to do if they're gonna really start
afore I know that was in the water works
but they I think yeah with the you know
the implementation of nvme and whatnot I
think there's like kind of like a look
that's kind of forget about sorrowful
and now some of the big views here do
you want to add anything else on that or
not no that's fine go so got some big
news Peter destiny to all these my
brother's telling me this is the hugest
news ever destiny to pc so it's coming
to pc destiny one didn't definitely will
come to pc and apparently it's going to
have crap cross-platform play as well
for the multiplayer so this is going to
be one of those huge games where
hopefully pc masterrace Lord saviors of
the world can combat their console
peasant you know antagonists and
whatever sworn enemies or whatnot so
we're pretty cool but besides that I'm
really looking forward to the game I
haven't actually seen much gameplay
footage yet so
yeah they've just had a reveal trailer
so far but it looks like September
eighth is what we're looking at for
destiny 2 i'm definitely going to give
it a whirl and it's looking like it will
be released on Steam too so that's a
really cool thing so you can jump into
steam start playing the game you'll have
fact there as well so hopefully it weeds
out a lot of hacks I know there was a
lot of concerns about destiny to and
hackers because pc is obviously a much
easier platform to inject tax into as
opposed to consoles so maybe it's each
to their own on see probably con sauce
probably easier because you just feel
like people do on these little but my
brothers tell me about some people
having these land switches where they
like switch on and off or something and
it's just they create this artificial
lag and then they just like teleporting
and killing people so ah never ah
apparently it's the thing so but you get
banned for it and if you get banned you
get banned for life so yes it's good
Jesse to are you looking forward to it
I'm really looking forward to it like
actually looking forward to it I can't
say I am really I never really got into
that franchise but um yeah I mean if
it's if it it turns out being as good as
that's you know people hyping it up to
be then maybe I'll start getting into it
yeah well the one thing that was a one
thing I tried I tried it with the
consoles Ivan brothers like get into it
man i had a ps4 and I tried it and I
used that Mouse convert a thing and it
was sort of retarded like I just was
like wow this is this is crap so I want
my bc smooth mouse rates of whatever
though it was just so bad i tried on the
console i moving my mouse around like
this sucks this sucks this sucks I just
rage quit after it is yeah it felt like
that was input lag being introduced all
sorts of crap coming on there with those
controllers so yeah I just wanted on pc
so it looks like they bring it to pc
it's still going to be a ps4 exclusive
though we're ps4 gets content out before
the other two platforms so yeah are you
guys looking forward let us know in the
comments are you looking forward to
destiny 2 for pc think it'd be really
cool it can be a shake-up better
graphics and
and nothing I will talk about what's
digital unveils their first portable SSD
and CSS these will come down in price
and I'd love to have a portable SSD I
think now we've got those USB 3 which
are with the really high speeds yeah 3.1
gen2 yeah like I've got this kingston
savage here this is really good it's got
a great burst rate on it so the birth
rates fantastic on this thing but it
does slow down after a little while so
i'd love to see one with consistent you
know 5-under make about speeds over
there's USB 3 ports that'd be awesome so
yeah I mean this would be pretty crazy
the prices will still in there seeing us
400 bucks for the one terabyte 200 bucks
for the 512 and hundred bucks for the
256 so obviously scales pretty well uh
hum with the prices but yeah it's still
quite a bit when you compare that to a
mechanical drive um like one of the
western digital ones you could probably
get a oh I have no idea but you could
probably go out much larger in terms of
capacity for a similar price points but
of course you lose the speed there and
that is the main downside so yeah I
think this would be pretty cool if they
keep doing this and the prices are
coming down I think this really shows
the benefits of USB 3.1 gen2 so yeah
this it's good that it would be taken
full advantage of it and I think a lot
of people who are wanting fast maybe for
guys like us if we're trying to quickly
move over files from one test system to
the other you know large files maybe
move over a game or something like that
to your friend's computer to to your
friends yeah yes I think it could be
very useful for some people out there
but um I would say at those price points
they are good in terms of when you're
looking within the SSD market but when
you compare to the overall sort of
external drive market that is a pretty
penny to pay for the luxury of that
speed and of course you have to make
sure that your
motherboard supports that USB you know
if you're on older motherboard it's not
going to be able to support you know my
only support USB 3.0 or no I'd not even
have that still gonna be absolutely fine
over USB 3 you'll get even not even 3.1
you should be able to get really good
speed so I think I like the
hundred-dollar version the 256 key but
obviously that's MSRP you probably get a
bit cheaper 9080 whatnot so I could
really use one of these things because
I'm capped at 64 gigabytes of this thing
at the moment and of course the speed
slow down after massive transfers so
something like this is looking pretty
good apparently Samsung already have one
out as well they've got a model out so
it's always a western digital vs samsung
thing at the moment it looks like
they're pretty they're clashing heads a
lot and might have check that out but I
could really use one of these in my life
it would be really cool again you get
those faster speeds which one you need
it just when obviously a lot of people
would be like you know have a good
network setup and you just plug into the
network plug into the matrix and copy
your files over with Smith support you
know yeah you have to use an adapter
though if you guys are running Taipei
ports I'm you'll have to run an adapter
because it's set up for our type sea
ports so keep that in mind this time you
have to be pulling out their depth is to
make that work and then there's of
course this is portability it's going to
be SSDs it's gonna be so small she's
gonna sip no power so really looking
forward to that so you just plug it take
it around with you everywhere it be a
little power be a little friend much
more much more i guess convenient than a
external hard drive even the 2.5 the big
ones because you got to be careful with
those things you can't exactly shake him
around I've dropped an SSD actually
quite a few times and they're just dead
tanks you don't want to drop you don't
drop a hard drive and then the thing
will be gone now it'll start making
first of all when you drop a hard drive
what happens is make it starts making a
weird noise and you're like that'll go
away over time but then it just gets
worse and it gets worse and then all the
sudden you like are pure almond so under
mat is so non-dramatic it's like oh just
died yeah I mean by one when it died my
seagate barracuda i just went to
yeah I get files of it one day and then
go into my computer or my pc now
physical it and and it just disappeared
it just wasn't there anymore thank y'all
dance so it's a slow what's going on
here um and yeah that thing just all of
a sudden name just fine fine fine and
one day gone gone skis even be sent out
that's how it happens it's how it
happens first sign of a slow down guys
if you go hard drive first signs of
weird noises weird problems back up your
files if you haven't they've yeah I've
seen this before with countless people
Brian my dad is gone help me and it's
like I can't help I can't resurrect a
dead drive i'm not a necromancer guys
well sir that's I've seen that one too
many times they always have double like
crucial files always have them double
backed up so just before we get on the
QA i will say thank you guys so much for
the patron support i also got a donation
for half a grand USD it was huge i was
like wow yeah so thank you so much for
you guys supporting the channel it's
really appreciated I really do
appreciate it so much like and you don't
have to i mean i get by you know doing
things i just i will and deal i hustle
I'm always working on the grind and I do
appreciate so much it does help a lot
thank you guys so much but of course if
you guys are you know struggling don't
don't donate any money you know if you
guys are in if you guys are on the
ground like me I don't want you to
donate money yeah I would just keep
grinding and grinding and harder and
harder so I'm a grinder bro that's what
I am that's what I do I grant is it so
what is the worst mistake you guys have
made whilst building a pc tech one ass
you want to get first uh yeah um hey so
my one I haven't really made any real
shockers um not that i am aware of but
i've made a few like stupid little
mistakes probably the the funniest one
was when the gtx 970 s9 80s and that all
came out that was the start of the like
zero decibelle technology with a fan
wouldn't always be spinning the fans
would turn off and so a lot of the
graphics cards because people weren't
you really didn't know at that time that
that was a thing and a lot of them
didn't have the indicators which we have
nowadays which see fans stopped and
stuff on the side a lot of them they
would put like stickers over the fans
that you get to rip off before you
install them which said you know if the
fans aren't spinning that's fine it's
part of this new technology all that
stuff the msi at the time the 970 i
believe it was um that if this big
sticker saying that over just one of the
fans towards the back of the car and i
didn't realize that sticker was on there
i think i was in a rush and I just
whacked it straightening my rig I booted
up and I was checking out the
temperatures making sure everything was
fine and I hey and I was wondering why
just one of the fans of spending really
hard and the temps were really high and
I was like ah this heart must be broken
or something's wrong with it so I pulled
it out to your name spatial I realized
I'd pulled off the sticker so only one
of the two fans was actually spinning
and it was the important one that's over
the GPU died so that wasn't really good
but there was I never made that mistake
again but there was not really my worst
mistake but probably the stupidest one I
made basically the only really dumb
mistake I've made but i can think of
when building a pc like I always rip
stickers off everything but I know for
instance my brother man he doesn't rip
any of those stickers off so he would
have came into the same thing there's
people out there that just don't like to
rip stickers off anything I've seen
countless people who have their
smartphones and they haven't pulled that
initial sticker off and it's not a
protective layer it's just because they
don't eat like fingerprints on the glass
screen or something so it's
understandable that's not really like
mistake per se it's kind of like just
one of the things if you're a I guess
OCD about cleanliness of your tech or if
you like mean really casually I want to
use this I want all the stickers off no
I don't like stickers unless they're
like transformers stickers then they're
pretty cool so West would say I've made
probably be when I was next two thousand
seven when I'd p5q multiple what else
you sighs I don't know what
I was doing but there's still live power
going through the computer and I was
just like I'm playing I like a and I
just take this thing off and then
playing around with the fan or something
and like you do you know live fans I got
a video on the 1080 TI review i'm
playing around with a live fan too for
the wind but you just dropped the screw
driver fell on the rig sparks just went
everywhere and i was like oh you
know i was just like whoa this is
real computer shut off with the safety
mechanism that's why it's always good to
have a good power supply guys the thing
will shut off straight away at that
point of time I was like damn something
is definitely broken here but sure
enough left it for a good 10 minutes we
went outside had a breather I came back
inside and booted up computer still
worked and that's why i love the old
school of Zeus motherboards it's why I
love the old school gigabyte
motherboards there was built like brick
 a--'s they were so tough dare
I'd say you do that on a motherboard
nowadays thing we've blown up we gone so
they've put really good components on
some of those lga775 motherboards so
that's just what you got to look forward
to no no don't have to look forward to
that's what you had to look forward to
in those days it was just really cool
yeah but of course those are the heat
pipes as well but that's the thing
wasn't it like really am like it was a
mistake that I busted the heat pipes but
I had to get that into that case because
I didn't wanted to hack up the case the
thing is hacking up the case wasn't an
option because I was going through
customs and I've already been scanned
through customs with pcs before they are
really anal retentive if you're going
through with a hacked up case man it's
just going to cause problems so hacking
up the case wasn't an option I getting a
smaller GTX 1070 wasn't just me like it
was at the time in Japan it was like an
extra hundred dollars for a 1070 that
was the cheapest 10cm it just went on
specialized I are pulling the trigger
don't really care if it fits or not I'll
make it fit that was my attitude and if
it yeah if the cool is my intention was
to replace the cooler with something I
had no no I had a heap of coolers and
yeah thus if one just worked so well I
was surprised at how well that
worked in the end and have fitted in the
mini ITX case it was really cool I
worked out so that was like a six dollar
cooler I picked at a junk been thinking
one of my previous vlogs it was ages ago
but that's why I always pick up bargains
and always recommend people if you come
across a bargain and you're kind of like
always building computers and it's your
passion never pass up a good bargain
because you never know when you might
need it that cooler that's this cool
that I got it was just really cool dark
side Jedi it was just bad ass I know
people say at scythe I just let census
is that is he gonna hate me for that I
say think so like bad sometimes like a
zoo so I'm never gonna change like Asus
man it's ASIS it's like not to Zeus get
used to it so if all our questions
leaflet says he wasn't very clear he
loves the channel in the direction that
he likes of directions going and he just
feel like the fun videos why he started
for the channel yeah when I was full-on
larrikin man that was I'm gonna bring
that back of course that just takes time
if the man behind the camera isn't right
then the contents not going to be right
and I've went through a lot of personal
 in the last year especially the
last year man it's been really tough IRL
and I know a lot of people don't care
about the IRL stuff but if I'm not right
IRL then the contents not going to be
right so I'm finally getting back into
the groove of things finally starting to
get my mojo back been like okay I'm just
gonna do a video the way I want to do it
include a lot of Larrick and stuff in
there the vlogs is one vlog a month i'm
not going to stop doing that one vlog a
month one use pc from the vlog parts
that i pick up that's kind of like a
ritual now people love it I love doing
it I want to eventually in the next
couple of months take on a real young
guys he's been so keen to work with the
channel is obviously going to be pretty
cheap on the salary so hopefully when he
comes on we can really get the videos
out every single day bang bang bang
content content content so that's what
I've got to look forward to a new office
going to ramp things up I promise you
guys like these aren't and I don't make
empty promises either so promise you
guys that's going to get it's going to
get up and running is going to get up
running really really well really
yes sir just quickly Brian yes sir we
got a donation from Dylan 873 thanks bro
so thank you so much chillin it's really
cool um and he said I tried to put a gtx
770 and an i5 4460 on a 300 watt del psu
the psu blew up luckily it didn't take
anything with it yeah that was
definitely stretching that she was it
yeah blown up power supplies is always a
fun thing though I've blown up one
before never gonna do it again never
gonna do it again never going to do it
again cuz it made me sick like I was
literally throwing up all day I was like
what's this smell and it got worse and
worse and then I finally realized the
smoke coming out of the computer I was
like oh and bang you know next
minute bang power supply's gone and then
after that after it blew out it made the
worst smell ever and I was like because
the middle of winter was pretty cold so
I didn't know how'd the windows open it
straight away opening the windows freeze
my ass off started vomiting it was bad
man so don't read don't use a cheaper
power supply and don't use an
underpowered valet two things can go
wrong and by the way air it's pronounced
the letter A ah you guys say it is a in
Canada sorry hey but it yeah yeah a i'm
going to go to Canada I still haven't
been there yet I'd love to go I love the
system's discussion about custom fan
curves how do you set it differently for
cpu versus GPU actually really good
question Jonny what parameters to look
out for when prioritizing one of the
following three categories efficiency
noise maximum cooling I'm going to go
with number two for me it's about the
noise for me there's a this is that
there's just a line it's like bearable
unbearable some fans just make these
noises that are just so unbearable they
usually reference fans by the way I find
the larger the fan the less noise it
makes in general and
a lot of the coolers coming out and GPUs
nowadays they're really quiet they're
really good I absolutely love what a lot
of the eighty percent the fans are on
eighty percent a lot of the cars I've
tapped the accelerators around eighty
percent the Auris they're on eighty
percent and they're just absolutely
kickin us a descent the noise is a
little bit noticeable but I can bear it
so for me it's about the noise where I
get those fans to before it starts
becoming unbearable obviously if its
maximum fans and it sounds like a jet
engine I'm going to tune that down and
then work from the noise it's weird
because I haven't been I'm not an OCD
guy about noise I like a bit of noise I
don't mind a bit of a bit of noise but
that's where i work from so i'll set a
custom fan profile it's usually the same
for the CPU and the GPU 50 degrees so
after 50 degrees my fans hit seventy or
eighty percent depending on the noise I
test it out but turning on the card or
the cooler before that Idol twenty
percent so it's just whisper quiet and
that's that's for me how about you with
your custom fan profiles oh yeah it
depends on what I'm trying to achieve
there so it with things like reference
model cards often times like things like
I used to run a reference to 90 years my
sort of spare graphics card and I would
set a custom thank her for that because
the stock one was just horrendous in
terms of noise and in that I traded off
noise or fan speed for temperature so I
didn't mind it running like 92 93
degrees when I was gaming constantly um
as long as it was staying quiet so
because those things were just so damn
loud but it's different for every person
so if you have overclocks your graphics
card or you know for example and you've
overcooked it quite high then you might
want to go through and see you know what
temps is getting up to now with that
stuff Bank of hake and I you know I've
still got say 10 degrees spear before it
starts throttling I'll maybe lower the
fan curve a little bit to keep those
noise down but then exchange they can't
grow up another five degrees and you can
make trades like that so I think your
first thing the efficiency and sort of
noise um I don't know
me like anyone who would run their fans
on like full bore because it's just
ridiculous and you don't really need to
even if you're overclocking there's no
real need on a good GPU cooler there's
no point really um so yeah I think
that's yeah we kind of have to look at
is get your over clocks and stuff set
the way you want see how you're doing
temps ways and then just kind of work
off that you know do that trade of how
we're gonna bring maybe the fan curved
down a little bit to bring the noise
down a little bit and in exchange your
temps are going to go up a bit and just
see sort of try find that balance and
once you get it tuned in like I did with
my reference to 90 really well I mean
that thing which those when the tourists
were being like a jet engine um that was
a lot better than in terms of noise it
was quite good but temperature wise it
was getting very very hot but it wasn't
throttling it wasn't going in 85 and
throttling it was sitting 92 93 and
would never go above that so we're still
very very hot but not throttling and
that was quite good as a balance so yeah
that's what I would say is the best
thing to do you just have to work off
your temps that you have and then from
the can figure out what sort of ones
will do the best for you I mean the same
goes for our cpu temps obviously as well
yeah okay so yeah i'll see further on
follows on with the gigabytes got the
gigabyte a be 350 gaming three it
features fan headers at different
regions so sometimes with the different
regions of the fan headers they're going
to be either for pin or three pin for
pin is pwm which then you can from the
boss you can control the fan speeds
manually if you've got the three pin you
can use the noise adapter voltage things
a like the noxious 12 volt 7 volt
whatever that reduces the noise by a
manual thing but you want to be hooking
into the 4 pin headers then you can set
your fan speeds with custom fan profiles
is running the NZXT s 340 k so k is good
with with the fan headers you only got
three if you've got four fans three fan
headers you might want to use a splitter
usually two fans off one head is fine
though if you're going with four fans
like I've done in my rising workstation
i'm using the water cooling fan header
because it's got double the power
doubled amps you don't want to overload
a fan header too much because they can
blow out there only right into a certain
amp engine power rating so don't
overload defendant it's too much but on
ebay you've got those one dollar fence
letters bang you can now hook up to fans
off one header which is usually fine for
12 120mm fans obviously probably don't
want to go with 200 mil fans off the
same fan header but bang forehand for
fans off those fan head splitters then
you want to probably go with the water
cooling fan header which I don't think
is on the a/b 350 gaming three if I'm
mistaken I have to double check that
don't believe it on the X 370 though a
lot of the X 370 ports they do have
those fan headers with extra power
available so even though they call the
water cooling option they're really just
fan headers with more power available so
you can use a forehand for fan splitter
on there and it works really effectively
works really well good sources for
custom cable sleeving if you guys are on
ebay there's the gamer chief in
Australia I don't know too much about
international but the game achieve
cables are so damn good they come pre
like sleeved with these really cool
combs in there that just makes life so
easy I can't really I've got them like
I've got a heap of them here and they
were on special and they're really good
value for custom cars leave cables and
they really do bring up a build they
really do cosmetically enhance a build
of course a bit RGB here enhances of
bill too but that's a subjective and so
yeah do you think third parties will
release code that will unlock disabled
cause on the r5 series but i don't think
so i think i think i and ii would have
learned their lesson by now I mean 2017
if they haven't then I'm going to be
extremely surprised and of course and of
course buying out our fives yeah no I
know exactly that's that's right just
just going back I looked it up quickly
about that motherboard for you Brian
yeah it looks like it's running those
that'd be 350 gigabyte it's running on
the lots of those four pins and says up
to sports up to two amps are belt
built-in over current protection so
that'll be great for you dude for all
your whatever is your water cooling or
whatever it is so that's going to be
just solid so yeah run them splitters so
the fact 1500 X will allow at 200
minutes xfr so xfr at the moment I I
mean I've got to test it more but I'm
really not a fan of xfr at the moment no
neither so when you talk xfr I'm not
really interested sorry sorry and Gary
it's just the potential is going to the
boss and manually overclock and get
those manually overclocked set set in on
all-cause because you know a lot of
people like oh man i'm hitting 4.1
gigahertz on xfr boost and it's like
they do a sinner bench run and the
scores are way lower than mine 4
gigahertz overclock so it's kind of like
it's for me I find xfr wasn't really
doing much at all in the real way it's
it does do the thing is that you guys
alot of you guys I think forget is that
it's not on all see we're using the 1500
X for the example oh that's a quad-core
a thread cpu it's not going to be on all
four of those cords the x-fi will be on
a single core and it will take it two
hundred megahertz higher usually yeah
and it's the same as what we're seen on
Broadway Lee for example you get the
boost or the turbo speed and that will
usually be on one or two of the cause um
depending COC with the 6800 k trying to
do it from memory that was it would go
up to 3.8 on the first two cores and
then the other four would be at 3.4 is
that correct account remember you own
the 6800 yeah so what uh yeah I think it
was something like that so would go or
it was 3.6 on the other four I can't
remember but you guys see what I'm
saying is that these it's not just for
AMD so it's not like we're just picking
on them it's that fact that these in
general will only take it up on one or
two cause we make
say but come back and say well that's
what's important you know for gaming and
stuff that is true but at the end of the
day would you rather have one or two
just going up would you have all of them
going up so then it's beneficial or even
higher than the xfr and that's really
what you want to see I know not only you
guys will overclock and it's still good
at the fact that exercise there is
better than no except our but the
difference isn't as big I suppose as
Andy touted it at least this was my
interpretation that the CPU is going to
be like what we saw from a video with
GPU boost three-point oh and that it
would keep overclocking itself
automatically until it reached like a
thermal limit or a power limit or
something like that so you would just
like with NVIDIA GPUs you chuck them in
and you might get three different ten
60s all the same model and one will go
to 1980 another one a go to 2040 and
other want to go to seeing 1920 you know
there's a bit of that's an extreme
example but there is that bit of
variance ear I think I personally I
thought that was going to be the case
for rising as well that I would chuck
one in it would go up to like 3.9 on xfr
chuckanut wanna go through point of this
not the case here it's just it's like
Intel's turbo boost I was finding with
the xfr was just doing the biggest
Wesley's bro like it was on just like
you just see it bang 4.1 key goes for
like a micro 7 microsecond insane it
drops it was ladies doing the biggest
Wesley Snipes men like ever here is he
was killing those movies back in the
scene when he was doing little Snipes
you know so yeah it's finals doing
Wesley's on all these cores and you like
wow what's going on here and this isn't
a true boost so yeah not at the moment
do some more testing but not too
interested in it so when do you when you
do the use builds or the mix use new
builds I think prove you said you try to
flip yeah I do flip them do you do it it
it costs you build yeah so generally
it's what I build them for so I just
like to do the videos the videos is what
makes it fun I usually sell them what I
get them for in Japan I was marking them
up a little bit in Japan because I could
get the extra money for him because no
one was
doing it but ever since I've come back
man the parts are drying up the it looks
like it's a really it's a real hobby
that's catching on so I'm having a lot
of competition now so and yes people do
know who they're by from like when I
meet Phil are you do that dude you know
they're like cool it cool and so that is
really it is there's a lot of fun so it
is a lot of fun doing it but it's just
yet the competition is getting pretty
high in the used parts in sir yeah hi
guys I'm pretty keen on picking up an
eight-core so spazzy wacky he says he's
keen on picking on a call do you think
there would be any advantage in waiting
for the are fives to launch yeah of
course I wait for an hour five I mean I
saw the r7 go down ten dollars like
that's still legit I mean of course they
will go on sale you can pick them up and
sell I love the eight core i7 17 hundred
I think it's a good safe bet even
picking it up now it's a great value for
money CPU of course and I'm going to
like the 1600 9x as well that's going to
be my to TX yeah that's exactly what's
about to say I be like dude just wait
that's 1600 the price to performance I
think will help do the 1700 out of all
the risin ships that they're releasing
that 1,600 I think my prediction right
now will be the best in terms of price
to performance I think that thing is
going to be ridiculous for the price
point it's coming in a seer I would
definitely just wait see how good the
1600 does by comparison and then make
your decision from there especially if
you're not going to be doing any
productivity stuff you were just going
to be gaming then yeah definitely wait
for rice and Parker come out well next
question is actually pretty big so
hungary he's waiting for these 1600
which is really cool but have you either
of you noticed a dip in advertising
revenue since restricted mode and all
the drum with YouTube advertisers came
about I've noticed a huge hit in just
its the I don't I don't think it's so
much the revenue has changed I think the
algorithms changed ever since that
happened and so my channels been getting
smashed I think now youtube favors
videos that are longer than 10 minutes
I think that's just this set thing that
comes in there so don't be surprised you
just start seeing a lot of more videos
being more than 10 minutes on my channel
but because I was getting into this
stage where i was making like six seven
minute videos i was really enjoying it
people were loving it because i just get
to the point but now it seems like i
have to stretch it out a bit because
again it's like survival survival mode
now you've got to do what's best for
surviving if you want to keep doing this
gig you know so it's kind of sad that
this has happened it's really it has
affected me I think some of my videos
were coming up people were telling me
that some of my pc builds up coming up
is restricted i'm like why what the hell
so it is affecting me I know it's
affecting me I know it's affecting a lot
of other youtubers out there who are
just getting their monetization
completely removed on videos and it's
not fair it's not fair at all because
this is that stupid article that the you
know Wall Street Journal brought out
it's like you can understand people a
living off this and they're doing it as
a job and it's you know if they've got a
fair especially especially they got a
family that depends on them like holy
crap that's a real douche move you know
is because you can't just get up and
change the profession overnight okay
that was very I think bad of them and
they really blew it out of proportion
the issues with adverts playing on may
be inappropriate videos but the thing is
that that that's what the leap they were
making was ridiculous the advertisers
obviously if a coca-cola read or
something else goes on a less than
appropriate video that doesn't mean that
Coke endorses that video it's just their
advertisement over the top of it they
are not aware they're not specifically
picking the videos it doesn't work like
that and that's what made it's so stupid
and that's what the Wall Street Journal
really that was really I think it
responsible and it you know I just think
it was really bad the big guys on
YouTube will be okay if you've got say a
hundred thousand subs or more I think
those people will obviously take a hit
as Brian was just saying but they'll
survive because it generals big enough
it's those guys with under 100k or
especially under
thousand subs but say above 10,000 the
people like me that's what a lot of
people are saying those are the channels
that will be collapsing because of this
I and the people have to give up YouTube
and go back to doing something else or
they will have to drastically reduce the
amount of YouTube videos they do and
pick up work somewhere else or something
like that and depending on how they have
it set up so that's the that's the thing
i think is why I'm harsh that they
really didn't take into consideration
but I in general I think the whole thing
was overblown I think all the
advertisers pulling out was maybe what
they kind of had to do because it was
like a chain reaction after a big one
Wow but I still think it's bad and like
that guy that wrote there's actually a
lot more to that story with that guy I
suggest you guys we won't talk about now
because we're gonna free just but I
suggest you guys look into the story a
bit more if you're interested because
that guy that wrote the article pretty
shifty like there's a lot of stuff
behind the scenes with him writing
something else about it you know like
this there's just a lot going on and see
I think it's quite quite bad engine yeah
parently apparently if you dig deep
enough there's this guy with an
algorithm fix who was trying to
blackmail google or so yeah that's what
is this painting and stuff like that
there's a lot of funny stuff going on so
that's pretty bad but yeah you guys if
you're if you have favorite creators out
there that you know they just know that
they will be feeling the bite and if you
want to support them then I suggest
donating to them if you can or something
like that especially the small guys out
there that many you are probably
subscribe to their under 100,000 yeah
easy I guess the Underground's been
affected the most like the underground
you know I mean we like the independent
content it's it's just what we do for a
living and it's kind of like okay it's
really
infected a lot and what can we do I just
got to keep grinding I can't do anything
about it so yeah anyway so Maura says
he's noticed really good questions this
week two guys really awesome questions
he's noticed a lot of aim for boards
don't include jewel biases any ideas
what is behind that surely it's not
expensive to add that feature I'd say
that they get the zero the X 370 chipset
design and then it would probably be too
time consuming or costly at this point
of time to add in a duel by us just for
them so you will see jewel biases
released in future iterations of
motherboards or revisions or what
numbered I just think they had to I
think the board I think everyone was
rushed to the market you saw that with
the coolers a lot of the companies
didn't have those cooler fixes day one
they were behind they were lagging
behind big time so aim for was pretty
rushed and with that became the jewel
bias as well probably wasn't implemented
early enough into the chipsets based
design so that's something that I'd love
to see a dual blast of course I know the
benefits of a dual pass it's awesome to
have so I was good to that safe just yet
that's good I mean they have a lot a lot
of them the asus boards and stuff have
that crash less bias or I forget where
their proper name is for it but
basically like when I had that be 350
and it had problems when I was flashing
the bios and then it bricked I still
managed to using a USB in that recover
the bias so you can bring them back that
way but ideally you do want the jewel
buyer so it is so much easier when you
run into that from a and the all you do
is just flick a switch and then
especially especially if you're testing
out custom bios you know hacked boss
yeah yeah it's really odd to have and
that's what I'm sure a lot of people
will want to do with the r5's as well
just to test it anyway so would you
rather use a G 45-60 pentium and ten
seventy or eighty seven seven hundred k
and a 1054 the rest of the year just
playing some games very good question
group is one probably that pentium and
the 1080 although yeah i'd go the
pentium in the 1080 at 1440p ultra wide
oh yeah
gaming that is yes it was if it was
productivity that I would start the
reverse yep yeah hands down to agree
excellent yeah yeah he's as an athlon x2
this is what we got a lot of questions
when I start getting through these maybe
just some snap snap answers here so he
has an athlon x4 three gigahertz a
negative SRAM what GPU would you
recommend for me to use with to get
decent FPS on your games i'd recommend
overclocking this thing as far as you
can if you can and of course it may be
just something like a 460 or a 1050 or
I'd use GPU use GPU would go really well
with this and then you'd find a decent
sweet spot where you could play like you
know 1080p at decent settings you got
anything done no no I would agree with
that Grover's is going to be swapping
out the motherboard next week and how
should i go about cleaning the thermal
paste off my i7 I don't have any alcohol
or damn ok people say to use my thermal
paste is only six months old so do I
need it is there anything else I should
watch out for when swapping motherboards
depends if its competitive or conductive
thermal paste if it's either of the two
and/or then you'd want to clean it off
properly if it's non conductive non
capacitive just grab it easiest way as
you soo grabs a tissue just quickly wipe
off the thermal paste on the you know to
the integrated heat spreader bang you're
good to go and put your new thermal
paste on even though it'll be a bit
messy but you always recommend alcohol
and alcohol wipes they're so useful in
doing a proper clean up after torching
just getting supposed to get either yeah
it's not hard to get I superb like oh so
you should be able to find it we live
without too much hassle and and it does
make a difference it does make it a lot
easier yeah comes off much easier when
you use it but you don't have to it's
like not like you absolutely have to use
isopropyl alcohol but it will make your
life easier if you do dragon Kurt he
asks if either of us done a mineral oil
pc i've seen one in the flash i haven't
done one yet love to do what but again
this it's kind of one of those things
that would be very time consuming and i
got no time at the moment unfortunately
sorry man so x Turkana he said been
requested in the show before by both of
our hosts but i'll put it in print
please refrain from answering the
questions in
oh yeah that's true yeah stop yeah i'll
agree with ex Turk so no yeah we skipped
a week to sorry guys yeah and coalition
gaming he bought a discounted use x79
board that had bent pins which caused
the gym not to work and they fixed it
and so that the other gym works now yeah
of course I've experimented with bent
pins and yeah it does if you guys been
pins back things can work again I've
fixed motherboards from the dead by
bending the pins back and then they work
again completely work fine subsequently
I've had boards that have just bad
whatever that you can't be fixed as well
so that's really cool that you got that
working again I know you game is your
main focus but a value opinion so what
cpu would you recommend for a low-power
multi-core processor for open media
vault or x penology home nice build I is
the am 53 55 370 worthwhile
consideration ah the old um was that the
two was it the you know court Cora like
two gigahertz thing is the jewel corian
sure I just recommend gone with the
cheapest penny and man they're so cheap
they could be under vaulted and they
just they when you're under volta man
under clock and they just sip so little
power and the resale ability of
especially of the G 45-60 would be
really good too that's be my guess again
I don't do a lot of work with NASA
that's right up Wendell's Avenue with
networking you know so much about
networking you probably give you the
best recommendations especially in these
forums but me I'm always been like a
like Windows Home Office noob cannon so
with networking but it works hey I get
results so it doesn't bother me so yeah
that's at the end of day what it gets
your results so lastly I can see for 2
terabyte refurb enterprises or see one
thing I generally don't buys refurb
drives if something's gone bad then
chances are something else in the in the
drive can be on its way out to that's
why I generally one thing I don't buy
refurbs refurb drive so I don't
recommend really you can experiment with
them dude but make sure you get some
warranty on them
so yeah I would just say get those WD
Reds yeah yeah they'd be solid yeah so
that's generally use use drives you just
check them out if they work they do
there's so many drive checking software
so much Drive checking software out
there they give you percentage values of
the drives good or not and they can
actually some drives can actually even
sort of not fix the drive but help give
it a longer life so anyway guys hope you
enjoyed the show this week be sure to
head over to the tech city TV / forum
there if you want to ask questions for
next week's episode I'm going to Sydney
tomorrow to meet up with the one and
only hardware on box steve has just been
I asked him to come on the show today
man and he was just so busy is just
benchmarking benchmarking benchmarking
so make sure you guys watch some of
these videos because he's just been so
flat-out benchmarking the benchmarking
the Ferrari of benchmarking is at it
again so we'll go we're going to meet
for the first time tomorrow too and in
Sydney so that's going to be really cool
to be at this event for course there so
if any you guys are in Sydney and you
want to go to the event for corsair meet
up with either me or Steve then make
sure you be there we'll meet up and
possibly even have a beer afterwards
guys so as always love your work keV
good stuff beautiful and loved all the
viewers out there thanks guys for
supporting the channel and watching the
show as well if you made it this far and
we will catch you guys next week and
also put a link in description below
foot Cavs channel and kept you have any
closing statements before we get on out
of here I know just uh thanks for
watching guys I really appreciate it and
you definitely hit over because I'm
going to be doing the most showdowns I
think I've ever done in one week with
rising five so you guys definitely going
to be willing to check those showdowns
out okay sweet so he does all right guys
beautiful beautiful love your work my
beautiful no beard of a love your work
mate all right guys we'll catch you next
week peace out for now and by</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
