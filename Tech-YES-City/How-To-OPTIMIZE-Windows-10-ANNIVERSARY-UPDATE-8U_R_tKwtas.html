even shut it down and you boot it up
again
and there's this Windows 10 anniversary
update you install it and all the sudden
everything is crap again things are
sluggish games are crashing you don't
know what to do but that's alright
because this guide is going to make
Windows 10 great again
welcome back to take your city this
brand coming to you guys today with a
full optimization guide for Windows 10
anniversary update now we'll get
straight on into it and I'll be on the
bottom right hand corner here going you
guys through the whole process but the
first things first left left click on
that search bar type in services and
then open that desktop app and we're
going to go through here and make sure
it's organized by name meat so that way
you guys can follow me and exactly
disable the services that I'm disabling
and remember as well this is how I
optimize my Windows 10 for me so other
people will do it differently but it
seems to be a very popular theme when I
update it and people want to copy my
settings so be sure to just go through
here copy it all and then enjoy a fast
and snappy windows so right click on the
first one here auto timezone updater we
just want to disable that unless you're
traveling internationally with your PC
which I doubt you are with your desktop
then you want to probably disable this
just one of those services you don't
need go down to connected devices
platform service right click that and
then click stop and disable get rid of
that one too and then right beneath that
is connected user experiences and
telemetry so right click that again
disabled and stop and we'll just apply
so and then underneath that we want to
go down to I believe it's called
distributed link tracking client right
click that properties same old jazz here
disabled stop bank see you later
no more data that I don't need to give
out unnecessarily this one here as well
this is on manual now so it shouldn't be
starting up but it used to be have some
controversy surrounding it being a key
logger that is the DM WAP Push SCV so
just click apply and click ok and then I
want you guys to go down to now radio
management service so this one I like to
disable this as well as it has no
bearing for what I do and don't need so
that's it for services let's move on now
to the next step so the next step we're
going to do here is go down this left
bar here and type in accessibility and
then we go to other ease of access
settings and there should be one here
play animations in Windows I want you to
turn this off
if you are on a real sluggish computer
you can also turn off show windows
background that's if your unlike a real
old computer you just made it to Windows
10 but that's up to you go up to
narrator here make sure they're both
turned off magnifier I like to turn
everything off here as well and that's
about it for this setting so the next
thing we're going to go through here is
just simply right-click on the desktop
and go to display settings here and once
you've clicked on that it should open up
a heap of tabs here and we want to go
down to apps and features and now within
this tab there is going to be a lot of
apps that we just don't really don't
need I mean 3d builder okay I don't need
it so I'm just going to get rid of that
we can also keep moving down and we can
go down to alarms and clocks app
installer don't need it and you're just
going through you guys can feel free to
uninstall the exact programs that I'm on
installing here these are just programs
I just don't seem so moving down along
apps and features now I'll put a list in
the description below of all the apps
and features that I actually uninstalled
from here as my screen went black when I
was doing this but moving on now to
default apps just make sure that you've
got the music player that you want
selected when app is the one of choice I
use and also for video play I use VLC
media player but the main one you want
to make sure is Windows Photo Viewer is
default on your photo of your app I
don't know why it's saying choose
default there but it should be Windows
Photo Viewer but moving down into
notifications in and actions here we can
actually take off these here and make
sure that you can turn off the ones that
you don't need so for me I like to get
notifications from apps for instance
Creative Cloud I like to know when the
actual program is updated or not and so
in the next one we can go down to now is
parents sleep you guys can copy me if
you want screen I like to turn the
screen off after 20 minutes and also the
plugged in PC I like to never put it to
sleep I also like to another thing I
like to do here is I like to have my
hard drive so in advanced power settings
I like to have it that my hard drives
never turn off and I've found so you
just type in 0 there I find that that
actually has never had a hard drive fail
on me so that's maybe something that you
guys want to copy as well for your
parents sleep settings moving down to
storage now I really have to touch
anything there offline maps pretty
important if you guys want to sort of
free up a little bit
room I like to delete all maps here and
then I also like to turn off
automatically update maps moving down
the tablet mode I like to click off and
I also like to change that to use
desktop mode and also just leave that on
that because it should always be using
desktop mode now multitasking we can
click on to this tab here and arrange
windows we can leave all those on
generally I haven't had a problem with
those multitasking settings there's not
such a big deal that you can change it
as you like it projecting to this PC I
don't want to projector my PC and vice
versa I don't want to treat my PC to
other people because everybody got
streaming apps to do that so the next
part of this guide we're just going to
right click on the desktop here and
click on personalize and we're going to
move into here and then go to colors now
you can turn this off here make Start
taskbar and Action Center transparent I
don't turn it off better for performance
miniscule amount and also I like to
change it to orange here is that's just
the way my theme is the dark theme I
generally don't like that at all I like
to leave it on light though your mileage
may vary then we're going to lock screen
here I don't like to get those fun facts
and I don't like to show the lock screen
background picture also get on to
Cortana lock screen settings just make
sure those are turned off yeah turn all
those off and you know and you can turn
that off as well history view so make
sure all those settings are turned off
and then we can move down to a start
here as well you want to make sure show
occasionally show suggestions on start
is off and then as well as show recently
open items and jump lists so that's how
I like to have it and then moving down
to taskbar this isn't pretty important
as well so another thing you can do here
is have it on the bottom and never
combine the taskbar as well and then if
we go down here to the notifications
area then we can go to turn system icons
on or off and now I generally like to
turn the Action Center off was that was
updated in the anniversary update and
sort of comes on there it's pretty
annoying in that bottom right corner I'm
kind of not used to it and I'll show you
guys exactly what I mean
so here it is here and we just turned
that instead of having it on we could
just turn it off and we'll disappear
here from the bottom right so I'll get
back to the bottom right there for you
guys and we'll move on to the next
now another thing on multiple displays I
like to do is instead of having show
taskbar buttons I like to have it on all
task bars and also I like to have never
selected so our second task bar on a
second monitor will also display our
applications and stuff so it's very easy
it's an easier multitaskers tweak so now
moving along with the guide we go down
here type in Windows Update and we can
go to Windows Update settings left click
that and also we can move down here and
go to advanced options in Windows Update
Advanced Options and you can make sure
just that's checked if you want to defer
updates as well that's something you can
do if you don't like one say for
instance Windows 10 anniversary update
but another important thing here is to
go to privacy settings sorry choose how
updates are delivered and make sure this
one is not on this tab here so you don't
want it on PCs on my local network and
PCs on the Internet
you don't want to be having your
computer as like a hub for sending
updates to other people that'll just
kill your network especially if you've
got sluggish upload speeds like I do at
the moment so check that make sure
that's just checked on or you can just
turn it off altogether and then back
here on the main tab we can go to
Windows Defender and just make sure that
I like to turn this notifications area
off if you want to turn off real-time
protection you can but it'll just turn
itself back on anyway and that's about
it for that tab there so now's are
actually very important setting with
Windows anniversary update they enabled
a thing called game DVR digital video
recording by default and this is causing
a lot of games to crash I've had csgo
crash on me I've had dota 2 crash on me
and essentially we want to disable this
or just turn it off now if you've got
the Xbox app and you really need that
and you can just type in here Xbox open
it up and then disable it from the
settings tab so if you like me and you
just want to completely disable all
together you can just type in here
PowerShell and then right click on that
and click run as administrator and then
what you want to do after this is then
type in here and I'll put this in the
description below you just control paste
this so I'll put it in the description
below for you guys just copy that drop
it in here it's get high
an app X package star Xbox app star /
remove - app X package and hit enter and
your Xbox app should be gone game DVR
with it should be gone as well so the
next thing we want to do is Cortana now
we actually can't disable Cortana from
the start bar like we used to where we
could just turn it off we actually have
to go into a thing called Group Policy
editor and now if you guys are on
Windows 10 home you will actually have
to do this via the registry edit and if
you guys want that I'll put a setting in
the description below just a quick reg
hack file you can download that
double-click it and we'll disable it for
you home users but if you're on Windows
pro or Enterprise for instance you can
then just open up that group policy
editor like I've got here open it up and
then we can just go to administrative
templates so we go to administrative
templates here move along now to I think
it's windows components so we get a
Windows components click on that tab and
go all the way down to search and then
we're going to go to double click allow
Cortana double click that and then click
disabled and click apply click OK allow
Cortana
above lock screen I like to disable that
as well so those two files disabled we
can then move on now to the next setting
so you like optimizing drives I like
optimizing drives he said the problem is
I don't like it when windows chooses it
for me so what we want to do here is go
back down to Start menu click on
optimize there and we want to optimize
hard drive I think this should be like
that should be the one defragment and
optimize your hard drive and left click
on that open that up and then we go to
change settings see schedule
optimization is on and it's usually on
weekly but I don't like this so I'm
going to go click change settings here
and I'm going to clock uncheck that run
on a schedule click OK and then click
going to click close and that's done
you're going to click OK for this next
part we're going to go down here and
type advanced system settings and once
that comes up you should be able to open
up the advanced system settings tab so
just left click on that and then move on
here to performance type in their
settings or left click that and
to go to and just change it to how you
want it I like to take all these
settings off here the fades and the
animations and also the show of shadows
under the windows and under the mouse
pointer so I like to take those off and
then also here in the startup and
recoveries I like to time to display a
list of operating systems I like to take
that off as well and then click OK we
move out in a system protection I
actually like to turn this off you guys
your mileage may vary but I find I
really need it if I'm getting a fresh
install the windows
I'll just reinstall the whole damned OS
so moving on now to remote make sure
those settings are taken off as well
okay so moving along here now we can go
back to this search bar and type in
privacy and then click that privacy
settings there and just going along and
make sure all this stuff is kind of
turned off I like to have it all turned
off so we're moving through off-off-off
and I'm pretty sure this will bring it
over from your previous installation of
Windows so if you followed my previous
Windows 10 optimization guide there
should be some other little ones though
that pop up like notifications turn that
off and no we don't want you to get to
know me because you're a computer and
the last time you got to know Windows
you did some like Nazi thing wasn't it
so let's apps access my contacts
turn that off as well in contacts and
then moving down into calendar leave
that off call history off email off just
everything off off off off
we're just turning this whole thing off
now another important one down here and
feedback and diagnosing settings is to
have this on never and make sure that's
on basics so we're sending myself a
little bit of information we just want
to send as least amount as possible as
well as freeing up things so background
apps another important tab here so we go
to background ups and I want you guys to
you guys can turn off the ones that I'm
turning off as well so I pretty much
leave them all off except for Microsoft
edge because if I'm playing YouTube
music through my browser I want to leave
that on so now another one we can so all
these are off except for Microsoft edge
so let's move on now to the next tab so
some last-minute tweaks that I'll go
through with you guys is to right-click
on the clock on the bottom right corner
and adjust date and time and then make
sure that this is set to offset time
automatically now after you've done that
you can go to the bottom left corner
here type in ms config and open that up
and then we go to boot here make sure no
GUI boot is selected and then go to
startup and we can open task manager
here and make sure those programs that
you don't want loaded up for instance
Realtek HD audio manager I like to
disable that and also the Windows
Defender notification item I like to
disable that as well so like to have
those two disabled and then I click
apply ok and we'll exit without restart
because we're still doing the guide and
now the final thing you may wish to go
to is a website called night comm ni ni
te comm and I'll put the link in the
description below for you guys but this
site allows you to get all those little
apps that you would need on a fresh
install all-in-one package for you to
download for your own personal use so
we'll go to this website and we'll try
and bring up say for instance all the
ones that I usually use
so for web browsers Firefox that's one
that I actually use because it's got
some great add-ons messaging Skype I use
that and then for meteor I use VLC and
also I use a winamp as well so I'd like
to click on those two and then over here
you can go to for instance a
file-sharing Cubitt torrents really good
as well and Avis is also a good
antivirus although Windows Defender I
find is doing a pretty good job and then
lastly get steam from here as well and
you can just pick all the ones that you
otherwise would need I like winner as
well so if I wanted to get that whole
package I would then click all those and
then I'd get in your ninite and that'll
get me an installer with all those
select programs that I need anyway
that's about it for me today guys if you
