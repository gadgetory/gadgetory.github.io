easy today I'm going to talk to you guys
about a interesting topic that I've
struggled with since I was 16 years old
that's right and it's how to get a clean
shave how do you get a clean shave I
finally figured out a really good method
that if you've got soft skin and a thick
beard you can get a clean shave day in
day out I'm going to share with you guys
these tips and then I'm going to show
you what I do what do we need to get a
clean shave guys so the first thing
you're going to need you're gonna need a
razor now this is not just any razor
guys this is a razor designed for soft
skin ok so this is my razor I bought
this for seven dollars and it's got five
blades and it's not Gillette ok so I
recently used Gillette razors and they
hurt they actually hurt me so I'm using
a razor design for smooth skin the next
item we are going to need is a facial
scrub when you're having a hot shower
you're going to use a facial scrub to
clean off all the dirt around here so we
clean off all the dirt guys and then we
are good to go the last item you will
need is a shaving gel guys a shaving gel
but not a foam we're going to use a gel
again if you're using a shaving foam
they are not that good ok Jill is really
good it doesn't foam at all and it gives
your skin a nice cooling effect ok after
we have these three items we are then
going to hot steamy shower for 5 plus
minutes ok now while we're having that
she'll we are going to use our facial
scrub to get all the dirt off okay
second step guys after all our beard is
nice and hot and warm we are then going
to put on our shaving gel after that
we're going to have this cup filled with
hot boiling water and we are then going
to begin shaving now when you shave guys
you want to be delicate I like to shave
against the grain okay so that means
coming against the hair so the hair is
pointing this way I'm sure
living this way now I just do pretty
much swipes and until all the shaving
gels removed because if there's no
shaving gel there and you start shaving
it's going to hurt again enough talking
let's show you how to get this clean
shave okay so we've had a hot shower
guys and now we've got our boiling hot
razor and we basically shave guys so I'm
going to go against the grain so get off
shaving gel applied and we are getting a
clean shirt so there we go
ok guys so there we have it a clean
shave and guess what it didn't cost us
that much money at all the razor cost
seven dollars the shaving gel cost four
dollars and the facial scrub cost only
three dollars so that's a grand total of
fourteen dollars guys now after shave
this is a big question what should you
use for aftershave well you can really
use anything you want as long as it
doesn't contain alcohol so alcohol will
irritate the skin a lot please remember
that so what do I use as a good after
shape well I'm going to show you that's
right guys I use baby oil
so I figured baby skin deserves baby oil
now this stuff's really good it's
lightweight it's very clear so I won't
leave any coloring on your skin and it's
cheap as well so there you go guys
that's what I use as an aftershave
remember one last thing guys the biggest
thing that's going to irritate your skin
after you've had a clean shave is
humidity okay it is a killer it's going
to really leave your skin irritated so
if you go out for a run as soon as you
have a shave you're going to get really
irritated skin if your skin is soft so
you guys I hope this has answered all
your questions today if you've got any
other questions please leave them in the
comment section below and I will reply
as soon as I can and of course subscribe
if this information helped you and check
out my other videos as they may also
help you arrey guys peace out for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
