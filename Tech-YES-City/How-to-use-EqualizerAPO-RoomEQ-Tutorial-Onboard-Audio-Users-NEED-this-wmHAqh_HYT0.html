free it alleviates that base roll-off
problem that plagues a lot of on board
audio users out there it can also help
with tinnitus dramatically if you are a
headphone user and last but not least it
can give you a general overall volume
boost or it can boost those footstep
frequencies in those competitive FPS
games
this is equaliser apo and i'm gonna be
doing a full tutorial today with it's a
sister program room EQ let's get it on
welcome back to tokyo city ladies and
gentlemen today is going to be quite a
big tutorial but a lot of it as well as
going to be me explaining why and that's
a big reason and i want to explain why
because if I don't I'm sure there's
going to be people in the comments going
why why why why why and so I want to
avoid that anyway first things first the
reason why I came into this program is
because I was recently testing new
motherboards on the x99 line namely the
gigabyte u d4 when that came through and
I tested that with my other headphones
and it was causing tinnitus problems and
they tested with my razor carcases and
if you guys have followed me for a while
you know that my razor carcase is never
caused tinnitus problems in the past but
when they started causing tinnitus
problems with the u D for I knew
something was wrong with the audio
solution on the motherboard itself and
so I started doing a lot more research
about it and essentially what I came to
was an interesting find in that there a
lot of onboard audio devices will cause
a thing called impedance mismatch and
what this will actually cause your
headphones to do is pick a frequency
rather exaggerate a frequency than it's
what it's used to playing so if we look
at two different frequency response
curves here from the same headphones for
instance my Fidelio L ones we can see
here the inner fidelity they've got a
frequency response curve like this for
the Fidelio ones but if we look at the
graph right next to it from a different
website digital versus you can see
there's this massive spike at around
seven and seven and a half K but looks
of it and so what we've got here is the
same set of headphones with two
different frequency response curves
which one should you trust
I honestly after following in a Fidelia
for a while I'd be trusting their graphs
and their reviews because they seriously
know what what they're talking about
when it comes to audio and they've got
the right gear to measure things I'm not
saying that digital verses don't have
the right gear but I'm saying in this
case it looks like there's most likely a
impedance mismatch here with this
frequency response curve and so a lot of
people using onboard audio are probably
having this problem and they're not even
knowing about it when they
in bed they've got tinnitus problems
because of this impedance mismatch and
today equalizer APO the first thing it
can do is alleviate this problem by
essentially dropping the the levels
around here around 7k or completely
cutting them down which I did and it'll
give you some relief from tinnitus
however to test if your headphones are
indeed doing this and this is how I
discovered it I went to a website called
audio not calm and I'll put all the
links and for all the programs and all
the websites I'm using today I'll put
them in the description below but
essentially what I did was I got my SPL
meter and I did a full slowly increase
frequency at full volume here across all
the different ways here is you can
probably hear it in the background but
essentially what it caused me to do is
it caused me to find that real big spike
around 7k and it happened on this
onboard audio solution the asrock
extreme 6 but it really it happened a
lot more like it was huge on myut for
was like 10 decibels above any other
frequency around this 7k mark and so
what this caused just cause my ears
absolute ache until I figured it out so
I'm glad I figured this out and I want
to share this with you guys because I
want you guys to take care of your ears
anyway once we've done that we can so
we've done this we've found that we
maybe have a impedance mismatch on our
headphones we then will want to install
equalizer AP oh and I'll put the link in
description below for that but just
essentially just open it up install it
I've already installed it and once you
install it you can go to your Start menu
and you I mean when you're installing it
it will it will give you the option to
go to configurator and what you want to
do here with configurator okay can you
open for me now it's open there just
didn't come up automatically what you
want to do here is you want to go to
speakers or select the output that
you're listening to so for instance I'm
using my speaker out here this output so
I will select this one and APO will be
installed on this and then you click OK
and then you restart your computer and
so once you restart your computer you
then go down to the bottom right corner
and go to playback device
and what you have to make sure is right
click here on your speakers the one that
you're using go to properties and then
go to enhancements and make sure none of
these boxes are checked
so essentially because it's a basically
what this is is a EQ that works pretty
much on the driver level it's really
lightweight and it's really good so once
you've done that you click OK
and now the program is ready to go
essentially so this program is ready to
work now we can essentially head to the
just go to this PC head to wherever its
installed usually its installed in
Program Files C Drive Program Files
equalizer APO I want you to open that
folder I want you to go to config and
then go to config dot txt this is the
main configuration file to equalize APO
users so it's a text-based
equalizer and the benefits to this is
really lightweight but there's also
disadvantage in that it's kind of hard
to get your head around it and there's a
slight learning curve also I'm going to
talk to you guys today I'm going to
explain the program to so you can get
using so you can be using this awesome
program 2d and it's free I mean what
more could you want so once what I like
to do is well I like to create a
shortcut to my desktop as you can see
already done here because this is the
main config file so once we're ready to
go we can open this up you can see here
that I've got my preamp setting -6 DB so
I'd like to have more control of my
volume
I find this settings pretty much perfect
one thing you can do straight away with
this program if you don't have enough
volume you can just give it a 12 DB
boost if you want to although you may
come into some clipping but especially
if you're listening to things that have
been recorded say 12 decibels below the
limit you can give it a 12 DB limit and
you'll have louder volume essentially
out of your audio but for me I like
minus 6 that gives me perfect control
from 0 to 100 on my onboard audio you
guys might want to give it - more for
instance if you've got the gigabyte UD 4
which is just extremely loud then you
might want to go -12 like I did when I
had that when I was using that
motherboard so essentially you can play
around with the volume straightaway with
this setting and
to you guys that's one thing that's the
first benefit of using this program the
second here is that you can include more
settings for certain situations so we
can see I've got a rock setting that is
just essentially adds a little bit more
and I'll talk about a little bit later
and we've got a Call of Duty setting
here so I'm going to this is another
benefit of this program you can
essentially pick those footstep
frequencies so you can hear footsteps
and gunfire easier so that's a huge
benefit of this program I guess let's
move on now to the equalization settings
which is easily the most important part
of this program and that is the filters
here so if you guys want to just
copy/paste my settings you're more than
welcome to us with all my tutorials I'll
put these settings in the description
below you can just copy them if you want
to but I'm going to explain what they
are so filter 1 &amp;amp; 2 this is basically
alleviating the bass roll-off but in my
case this comes pre-installed with the
program by the way but in my case I'd
like to give it a little bit more so I
like to give it 6 &amp;amp; 3 that gives it a
nice little bit of low-end sub-base and
a little bit of a bass boost there which
I do really appreciate I'm a bit of a
bass lover but I love mids the most but
I like some good bass - oh yeah anyway
we move on to filter sorry that should
be filter 3 and filter for anyway
filters 3 and filter for these are the
settings here that are the ones that
take away that 7k tinnitus killer so
basically this you can copy/paste this
but I like to do a high shelf so I'll go
through what these mean PK is basically
parametric so you can set what frequency
you can set the gain you can set the
bandwidth of that frequency so you can
see here 20 Hertz that's low-end as we
get start to go into 8,000 that's high
and that's treble the gain there 6 DB is
going to give us more volume - 6 DB is
going to give us less volume Q once this
is the bandwidth of the octave in the
actual equalizer Q is really wide Q
value of 1 is extremely wide a Q value
of say 9 is pretty sharp and so if you
guys want to do different EQ settings
you got to play around with the Q
settings and I'll put a link in the
description below that goes more in
depth on Q settings but just understand
that
one is a really wide bandwidth of the
frequency curve say for instance nine is
really sharp just remember that so the
higher you go the more sharper it is in
relation to cue so anyway once we go to
his high shelf HS so the next setting
high shelf basically just shelves up it
goes up shelves those frequencies up or
down as you can see here I've done a
high shelf so after a certain frequency
it'll shelf it up so after six thousand
eight hundred what I've done here is
I've made a shelf that goes down and
we'll take it down by 6 dB and then I
made another high shelf frequency so
after this eight thousand three hundred
it'll go up 6 dB so essentially I've
chunked I've just cut out the body of
6800 to eight thousand three hundred by
six decibels there's other ways you can
do this you can do it via q1 if you want
to smooth it out more you can do it
actually that's kind of like the two
only ways you can do it you can do it
low shelf if you want to do it the
opposite way eight thousand three
hundred but basically there's different
kinds of EQ settings there's shelf
settings there's the parametric one
there's also a high-pass filter and a
low-pass filter as well which will
completely cutoff the frequencies before
or after those certain points so I will
put a link in the description below that
goes in more in depth about the settings
if you want to understand them but
hopefully this is just a basic basic
quick how-to on these frequencies so
once we've done that we can save that
and now we're going to look at for
instance these include ones so if you
take this number off you can do it a few
ways you can just miss print the file
name if you don't want to have it on I
just like to do the normal way that's
put the number mark in front of the
include and then you go to rock here and
you can see here with rock this is my
rock setting so I had to give it a bit
of a little bit of a boost there on the
preamp so I give it a 3 DB boost there
and I like to do a parametric EQ at 1000
Hertz of 3 DB with a wide bandwidth and
just 5,500 again 2 DB and it just gives
it a little bit more of an edge to my
rock when I listen to it I like these
settings personally I've just played
around with them quickly and this is
what I like for a rock it sounds really
cool you guys can copy that
if you want to for rock though depending
on your headphones again you're going to
want to test these things with your
headphones next one I wanted to talk
about is Co D this one here at caught so
I've done a little I've opened up a
little thing here that I've done here so
basically what I did here and I'll put
these two folders in the actual video so
you can hear them yourselves but here we
got card this is the first once I copied
some of the footage from the game I then
went press play and I boosted it at 1k
and so hopefully you can hear this is
flat so I'll let you guys hear it for
yourselves and so what we've got here is
you can essentially copy some of your
game footage put it into an EQ like
Adobe Premiere Pro and you can analyze
and sort of find out what makes the
footsteps easier to hear grab those EQ
settings for instance point to one
octave we can then go to Google I've got
two here go to this setting I'll put
this in the description below - you can
then type this in 0.21 calculate and
that will give us a cue setting to whack
into equalizer apo for COD and so we can
see here I've got it here Cod footsteps
1000 Hertz 20 DB bass Q value of 6 and
it looks like it's 6.8 and so
essentially what this will do is it will
do exactly what we did in the video give
us that real big boost to those those
footstep sounds so if you guys want to
get an edge in your in your actual arm
video games the FPS especially you can
use this program to give you a boost to
those footsteps okay so that's equaliser
API in a nutshell this concludes the
first half of the tutorial basically it
can give you more volume in certain
situations it can fix that bass roll-off
that play
a lot of onboard audio solutions mine
included it can help reduce tinnitus
dramatically and then it can give you a
boost in certain games there's probably
some other things you can do with this
program I'm still I only just got it a
few weeks or actually about a month ago
and I've been testing and playing around
with it and I really like it but this is
the basics of equalizer Apo
let's move on now to the second part of
the tutorial which is a room EQ okay so
room EQ this is a program that you'll
have to go to a forum and register for
if you want to download it it's optional
it is a little bit difficult to use and
before we get into this part of the
tutorial I will say that you will want
to have good gear if you want to get
good frequency response curves out of
this program so here I've only I'm only
using a shure sm58 and so the the
frequency response curve i get out of
this mic might be different because this
might not be actual fully flat mic who
knows right so essentially and i know
because i've got DB meter here and i
actually tested it and it gave me
different results so if you want to get
a frequency response curve out of room
eq they're going to measure it with the
mic and you're going to use your
headphones to put the volume into the
mic and going to do a sweep and that
will give you a frequency response curve
then you can edit the eq in room eq and
then export it as a text file so let's
go into that this will be the second
half of this tutorial quite long I know
but I hope you guys enjoy it so this is
room EQ basically as soon as you've
installed it and opened it it'll look
like this now first thing you want to do
is if you're going to use this program
to equalize your onboard audio you'll
want to turn off all your filters that
you've enabled in equaliser API
basically you want your onboard audio to
be flat right because what we're doing
with the first thing
well I'm showing the first thing you can
do with room key or the first thing I'm
going to show you is that you can check
your onboard audio actually that what's
coming out of the DAC and so what we got
here is go to great click on preferences
at the top right corner and then set
your output device and input device to
whatever's going to measure it so
basically connect your speaker cable
from your headphones and then plug it
into your line in and
see what this programs going to do is is
going to measure the actual onboard
audio itself and so once we've done this
we can then set our volume levels and
then set our line in so I just leave
mine at 66 basically that's fine for
this test I left my output volume at 66
and I left my I actually turned my sorry
this is the wrong one this is microphone
I've actually got to go to line in and
change that to a hundred so that's at
100 and my output volumes at 66 so once
we've done that we've check the settings
we can go back to preferences and we go
to next and we want to make sure all
these levels here are the same so keep
changing your volumes around so you've
plugged your output your headphone out
to your line in directly as I showed in
the photo before all these levels are
the same click Next and basically what
this will do is this will measure your
onboard audio as you can see here you
can see straight away that's just on the
measurement there this is what the
realtek onboard audio solution
essentially plays before it even reaches
our headphones before it even gets
converted into or it's actually an
analog signal but this is the analog
signal it's giving to our headphones
essentially and as you can see here
there's that bass roll-off you look
there before 50 Hertz there's that
roll-off and that's I mean it's a lot
better I'm going to save the real tag
11:50 over at 20 kilohertz we can see
the roll-off there that's not such a
problem since I don't know any ears or
my ears I can hear up until 19 kilohertz
and it's pretty I'm pretty insensitive
to those frequencies anyhow but yeah you
know basically Golden Ears might want to
drop it up to 96 kilohertz
but even then so you can see here that
starts to roll off at the 20 gasp normal
but what we're worried about here is
that 50 Hertz that pre-roll off there so
that's I mean essentially that's a
problem but this is what equalizer apo
essentially fixes when we turn on our
filters right we're just going to turn
on our bass filters here I'll also
enable my usual filters so you can see
what's going on but essentially we're
going to re measure we're going to
remeasure this now so we've put our
filters on and we're going to re measure
Calla recalibrate the recalibrate the
device or repeal rate the onboard audio
we're going to see what we get this time
around so I've applied my filters and I
just want to show you what equalizer
does and how it
alleviate the onboard audio the bass
roll-off anyway so what we can see here
is a dramatically different result now
as you can see here this is essentially
what's coming out to my headphones now
and this is how I like using my
headphones every day now because that
dropped as you can see here straight
away we see there's a nice big bass
boost there I love that we've also got
so you see the bass Roloffs practically
non-existent now it's actually quite the
contrary and so we've got more bass this
time around and over to the right here
we've got less you know that drop there
to edge off those frequencies so just
comparing it to the standard this is my
adjusted settings and equalizer Apo as
opposed to the standard there so the
bass roll-off sprint pretty much
completely fixed which is great and then
we've fixing those harsh frequencies
caused by that impedance mismatch so
this for me is essential now that I use
on now that I started using equalizer
Apo absolutely love it and for me it's
essential and so I can't not use this
program any more now I know what it does
so I recommend you guys get a little bit
of a bass boost there from equalizer a
per at the very least to alleviate that
space roll-off that's caused with the
standard onboard audio solution so this
is just the first thing that room EQ can
do one of the basic things and one of
the basic reasons for showing you the
first half of this video because once I
analyze it I was kind of like yeah well
now I understand what people are talking
about with base roll-off completely
because I measured it myself and this is
the results it's giving me here so
anyway let's move on now to the second
half of this tutorial where we will be
showing you how to EQ your headphones
with room EQ you've probably seen all
these fancy graphs people showing you
how to do it but they don't go in-depth
on how to do it and so what I'm going to
talk about is how to go in-depth and how
to use room acute EQ your headphones so
this is the second part of the tutorial
where we're going to use our microphone
to eat get an equalization curve of our
headphones and then we're going to edit
it in room EQ so again like the first
part we turn off all our filters here
connect our headphone out to our line in
and then we once we've done that we can
then go to spi
meter click here on the SPL meter
setting and then we can go to calibrate
and basically what we want to do is we
want to calibrate our listening level to
microphone that's recording and so we
can just use the re W speaker signal
there have our headphones right up to
the microphone or wherever you pretend
the microphones your ear essentially
that's what you're going to be doing
pretend that microphone that you're
recording it with is your ear and then
you match it and I do suggest normal
listening levels as well what you
usually listen to music at so those
volume settings as well that's I would
suggest around there but once we've
matched the SPL meter there we can do a
frequency sweep and so go up to measure
so you click on measure there after
you've done with SPL meter you click
over the top left corner measure
starting frequency 50 Hertz is fine and
frequency a 10 kilohertz that's fine as
well for our levels it - level at DB
frequency sweeps fine there - 12 1m
that's that's the longest sweep and then
I usually do two sweeps even the more
the better I mean I'm just for this
tutorial I'll just do one sweep so
essentially that's just one time it's
going to play all those frequencies
through I do suggest doing it a few
times and now while you're doing this
you will want to be very careful not
move anything don't
if you move your headphones that'll
change the way the frequency comes out
of these headphones now because
essentially right if you if you were
putting a headphone on your ear and you
move your headphones around right what
happens rather sound coming out sounds a
bit different so it's the same thing
it's hard to get a really accurate
representation of the actual frequency
response curve and so I mean what's
hitting your ears might be different to
what even a professionals using on their
test dummies right so here I clearly
stuffed up so I'm going to do it again
but the more times you do it the more I
guess if you do it a lot of different
times you'll eventually get an average
of what it should sound like and now
another problem with this is that as I
said might have said before but I'm only
using an sm58 this is just a normal
voice microphone it's not a professional
microphone for analyzing frequencies and
so I'm pretty sure that gear
a bit of money I mean if you're using
I'd say a condenser microphone would be
better so if you've got a condenser
microphone then it would give you more
of an accurate representation I believe
but again this is the problem I have at
the moment I can't get a fully accurate
representation of the frequencies here
as you can see before as I showed you
before when I was measuring with my DB
meter at around 2k that you can see
there the 2k bumps actually bigger than
the 7k bump but when I was using my DB
meter the 7k bomb was 8 DB higher than
around 2k or something like that so I'm
gonna trust the DB meter because that's
that's actually the one I've got to
actually got really good reviews and
it's been known to give out accurate
results so once we've done that we can
click Save As anyway save as Fidelio l1
I'm going to save that frequency
response curve there and then we're
going to go up to the right top right
corner and go click on EQ and
essentially this is the part where
you'll got a graphical user interface
and this is why people like using this
because you've got a GUI but you want to
go to equalizer some basic settings
change that to generic because generic
settings is what equalized API uses the
actual other program that actually
implements these EQ changes the other
settings as for the other settings our
speaker type you can just leave that on
full range and as for the other settings
don't really you don't really need to
touch them because we're just using the
EQ and the graph here to equalize what
we've got so essentially once we've done
that we can go to click on the actual EQ
filters button there and then we can
click on manual so this will bring up a
range of different settings here we
click on and we want to change all these
to manual I mean you could leave them on
auto give that a try if you want it just
I know equalizing a EPO is a manual
program so personally I'm going to
change them all to manual and there's
actually 20 of them I need just showed
you 10 so you scrolled you want to
scroll down and change all them but what
we can start doing here is go to PK
that's parametric EQ and I'm not going
to explain all the different types of
eq's that's up to you guys to do
yourselves but just going to explain the
program here so you can see here I want
to drop say the 2200 frequency curve
even though this frequency curve is
wrong and I know it's wrong and I've
measured it incorrectly I'm just going
to show you how you can use this program
let's just get on to it this is just a
how-to anyway so say for instance you
had the perfect gear and you did the EQ
right then you could then load that into
here and you can start as you can see
here you can change the put manual
controls in there and then change the
frequencies and as you're changing them
room EQ will give you a visual
representation of what the new frequency
curve is going to look like so we're
dropping the gains down we're dropping
the Q values down
that'll give us a more broad a broad EQ
more of a broad EQ the higher the Q
value the more sharper the EQ change
will be the lower this Q value is the
more wider it will be so just keep that
in mind
and so octave is actually if he's using
the octave settings that I showed you
before it's actually kind of the
opposite and so I have put a link in the
description below if you are wanting to
change those values into Q values you
can do that with that changer anyway
let's look at here so what we're
essentially what we're doing is I'm just
doing a quick rough really rough as guts
I mean this is really rough so it's
really draf I just want to show you how
you can use this program here obviously
you want to take more time if you want
to get a flat risk frequency response
curve and you'll probably want to get
some good gear if you really do want to
get a perfectly flat EQ out of you're
out of this program so maybe if your
friends got a good condenser microphone
say like an 82 or 3/5 or something you
could borrow that just to EQ your
headphones then that will give you a
pretty good representation but keep in
mind though that you have to hold your
headphones in the right position and you
don't have and you don't want to budge
you don't want to have any external
noise affecting this EQ curve but once
we've got a good EQ curve representation
here we can just change it around as you
can see as I'm putting in these values
I'm giving certain frequencies of boost
I'm taking off
levels from certain other frequencies
here it's starting to get more flat so
that the solid Green Line is our
original EQ the lobe light that the
faded green is our new EQ curve and so
I'm pretty happy with that and just for
example you guys might want to spend a
lot more time with a lot more filters
but we just click on save as and I'm
going to say that
LOL one so once I'm finished with this
frequency cue here I can just save as
and then type in Fidelio l1 sorry for
the cut I just had to get the door the
postman was there anyway let's continue
so once you're done there you can just
save it as Fidelio l1 so save it as a
dot rec file initially and this will
essentially what this will do is it'll
apply the settings to your EQ so you
close that down everything's good to go
now though we don't have a text file yet
but what we do is once we're at the main
menu here we can click on file export
and we can click here filter settings as
txt so I'll do that again click on file
export filter settings as a txt and you
can call out Fidelio l ones or whatever
your headphones are called
whatever you want to call the file so
save that as a txt file I'm just going
to call Fidelio one EQ and then we can
go to our desktop here and we can just
check to make sure these settings are
there so once we're on our desktop check
here and we can see all the settings
that we applied in that EQ in room EQ
are ready to go now for we can just copy
that into config dot txt or we can
rename this file config dot txt if you
want to use do it that way so that's it
or we can do it you can just put it as
an include file in your config dot txt
if you wish to so there's a few choices
you can do with equalizer API but
essentially that's all there is to it
guys that's room EQ with your headphones
let's move on now to a conclusion so
that's it for today's tutorial I hope
you guys enjoyed it a lot if you have
any questions please leave a comment the
comment section below and if there's
anything you wish to know more about
these programs then please let me know
as well and I'll try and help you out as
much as I can
again though I'm not the master of both
these programs I'm just doing a basic
how-to with them I've still got a little
bit to learn with them but they're
absolutely phenomenal programs
especially since they're free and in my
case they fix my tinnitus problems and
they just gave you know they give that
nice boost in rock they're good for
games they fix that bass roll-off and I
mean it's just a phenomenal program I'm
really impressed with it especially the
equalizer Apo
room EQ that requires Java to use you
know
requires a lot of time if you wish to
get the right EQ settings for your
headphones but it is a powerful tool and
especially as you saw in there I could
measure the actual roll-off on the
onboard audio so it's great I'm going to
be using this program more when I do
motherboard reviews I can measure
crosstalk with it I can measure the
frequency response curves of the onboard
audio with it as well so a great little
program there so you guys I hope you
enjoyed this tutorial please give it a
big thumbs up if you did like it and I
will catch you with another tech video
very soon and I sorry I've been gone for
a week in a bit I've just been really
busy as usual you know work Peaks and
then I try to get a video done for you
guys when I can and this is that time
now so I'll catch you guys when I'll
take video very soon anyway peace out
