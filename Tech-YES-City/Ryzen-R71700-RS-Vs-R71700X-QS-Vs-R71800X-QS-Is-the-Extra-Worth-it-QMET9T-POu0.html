Sunshine State but today there's a
cycling going on that side so it's
called the wet State and what better to
do then over clock three rise in our
seven CPUs because that's what I've been
doing anyway
regardless of the weather welcome back
guys and today going to be overclocking
three different rising CPUs two of which
will review samples up being the r7 1700
X and also the r7 1800 X and then
comparing that against my retail sample
v r7 1700 now Paul's Hardware already
did a very similar video to this which
is a really good video so if you haven't
checked it out already then I'll put the
link in the description below for you
guys but basically he said the r7 1700
was the best value out of the lot
symptoms got relatively close to his
upper to r7 CPUs in terms of maximum
overclocks and today I'm going to be
giving you guys my opinion and what I've
done with my CPUs and how they overclock
so let's get into the first CPU so the
CPU of most curious about was the r7
1700 since it comes in at 330 dollars
and also includes a cooler now also
recently tested this a couple of videos
ago on a be 350 motherboard that I got
for like 80 US dollars extremely cheap
and it performed really well it got to
three point eight five gigahertz on all
caused with the stock cooler though I
wanted to see how further it would go
with a much better cooling solution and
also a better motherboard so today I'm
using a ek predator 240 and also might
as Rock Taichi motherboard to see how
high this CPU can go and when I started
overclocking it they found that the
maximum overclock I could get out of the
CPU was about 4 gigahertz on all cause I
could boot into a little bit higher with
a 4.0 5 gigahertz but it would just shut
down and even with the over-voltage and
overcurrent protection switched off it
just wouldn't go any higher
however 4 gigahertz for the price I paid
for this thing was absolutely phenomenal
especially on all caused so the next of
you I've got in the lineup here is the
r7 1700 X it comes in a little bit more
expensive than the r7 1700 however it
doesn't include a cooler but it does
come with a thing called xfr technology
where if you put a cooling solution
it will boost the CPU automatically now
I found on the tachi motherboard this
really only worked for single or dual
core applications or when the threads
are loaded up dynamically it wasn't
working when all the cores are loaded up
I found in Cinebench and also in games
that load it up a lot of threads it
would only load up to 3.5 gigahertz
maximum though it did report 3.9
gigahertz on single cause when I was
doing single threaded test which was
exactly where my main overclock was
sitting on this CPU and I managed to get
it to 3.9 gigahertz at one point 3 6 1
to 5 volt and this was the lowest of all
the over clocks I've seen here though
keep in mind it was a hundred megahertz
lower than the r7 1700 and also the next
CPU that we're going to look at so now
lots of you here is the r7 1800 X now
this comes in around $500
it also doesn't come with a cooler and
it also has the support for XFR
technology and putting that to the test
I found it boosted up to 4 point 1
gigahertz so 200 megahertz higher on xfr
then the r7 1700 X however on all calls
it only managed to go to 3.7 gigahertz
however I shouldn't be saying only
that's actually pretty good considering
you'd have to do anything at all so if I
wanted to overclock the CPU which I did
I managed to get it to 4.0 to 5
gigahertz on all course so nothing
really changed and I was using the
latest bios here now this managed to hit
these speeds at 1.39 75 volt stable and
also an interesting thing is when I ran
all these CPUs on stress tests they all
leveled out and around the same
temperatures I was using just the latest
version of hardware monitor which does
report the CPU temperatures pretty
accurately I'd said saying that was
maxing out at around 54 degrees maximum
on all three different tests at around
similar voltages though let's talk about
the winner here and in my opinion the r7
1700 comes far ahead of the other two
with it being just simply awesome value
for money it clocked a hundred megahertz
higher than my r7 1700 X it was only 25
megahertz below the r7 1800 X and it did
that with almost using 20 millivolts
less so the clocking in at one
point 375 volts versus one point three
nine seven five volt on the 1800 x so
did o'clock in low it will use a little
bit less power and it will get similar
over clocks to an r7 1800 X and you also
get an included cooler so if you guys
are into manually overclocking your CPUs
then you'll definitely want to get an r7
1700 save some cash and just have an
awesome time on the rise and line up
though what about the 1700 X and also
the 1800 X well they do have their
places of course if you guys don't want
to do any overclocking at all and I know
some people out there that just go to
work they want to not worry about
entering a boss or having any issues or
any troubles with their computers they
just want to get the best performance
out of the box well that's when the its
1700 X and also the 1800 X come into
play the 1800 X obviously being about
200 megahertz higher in its maximum
frequencies than the 1700 X out of the
box so if you just want to get that easy
to use really good rise in performance
then you can get that with the 1800 X
and you guys are probably lastly
wondering about the memory over clocks
and Rison well I've tested now three
different CPUs across three different
motherboards and the maximum I can get
my memory to at the moment is 29 33
megahertz on a cold boot now as some
more updates flow through on the boss we
may be able to get more higher memory
speeds but I do believe that 1t Command
rate timing is holding us back unless
you have some really good memory however
keeping that in mind the performance
with a 1080 Ti is just simply phenomenal
at the moment with these CPUs and I will
be now that my rigs running really
smooth I will be re testing it against
the 7700 K at a few different
resolutions to give you guys just a real
date with that video because I believe
some of these performance updates are
flowing through now and the Rison is
running near its best now guys hope you
enjoyed this video and if you did then
be sure to hit that like button and let
me know in the comments section below
which is your favorite pick out of the
awesome and why not me closely men that
are seven 1700's it just can't be beat I
absolutely love the proper qualities
the market at the moment but would love
to hear your thoughts and opinions as
always and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon please now
for now bye
well it's usually called the sunshine
sunshine there
