performance issues with black ops 3 and
me myself I was trying to identify the
problem so today I did some tests and
the results were pretty immediate and
pretty conclusive there are two settings
in the graphics option menu which are
causing horrible stuttering and they are
order independent transparency and
subsurface scattering so I want you guys
to turn these settings off if you want
to have a good gameplay experience in
call of duty black ops 3 now today I'll
also talk about my optimal settings and
a little bit more on performance issues
and maybe what Treyarch could do to
improve this game so let's talk about
that
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
tech s city this is brian coming back to
you guys today with a little discussion
on the black ops 3 performance issues
now in the past this has been known
recently for us to get a release on PC
with the cod series and it have
performance issues and I'm kind of a bit
over it I wish try och here's a message
to you guys if you're making these games
just take these settings completely out
of the fucking game like seriously no
one I think I speak on behalf of every
PC player here but no one wants horrid
stuttering in your games now the good
thing about black ops 3 is that you can
turn the settings down a little bit or
turn off the culprit settings and the
game will run as smooth as butter which
is a good thing spiders say when ghost
was released this didn't happen you
would even turn it down to medium low
turn everything off the game would still
stutter so at least with black ops 3 you
have the option there to have a smooth
gameplay experience but I will emphasize
that one more time
Treyarch just remove these settings
completely the order Tran independent
transparency and also the subsurface
scattering just remove them they're
causing clearly they're causing big
issues in the game at the moment on the
PC just get rid of them everyone will be
happy at the moment and also there's
another thing I want to talk about
that's the extra textures and the extra
shadow quality now with these two
settings I found that they did tax the
vram a hell of a lot especially at 4k I
got like an increase of like almost over
1.5 gigabytes of vram being used over
high settings and I didn't notice much
of a fidelity increase there in the
graphics so what I'm recommending to
people is if you want to play this game
especially a 4k just drop the settings
down to high and sort of turn off all
these other tweaks settings I'll give
you guys a look at my tweaked settings
here and the game will be as smooth as
butter at 4k and it will look really
good now I don't know if you want to
take these settings down to 1080p or
1440p as well but I'm guessing that they
will run really well at those
resolutions as well so if you want the
best sort of optimized settings for
playing black ops 3 at the moment then
these are my settings here it's gen
really high across the board with all
the extra crap turned off and then
you've got SM a a at one speed because I
play at 4k if I'm dropping it down to
lower resolutions I'll probably put that
on to speed so there you generally
sweetspot settings in terms of the
graphics menu now for input lag on the
mouse I turn mouse acceleration off I
mean I shouldn't have that you shouldn't
have that going on in your game anyway
I've got my mouse speed it'd probably be
about four and a half there and that
seems to do me fine you you know you're
welcome to try out your mouse settings
but I generally have I'm having no
problems with input lag I'm finding the
game very responsive keep in mind though
I do turn off vsync and gsync on this
game and I also set my pre-rendered
frames to one and I mean I mean it's not
so fun though one thing I will lastly
touch on is these server-side issues as
well I noticed yesterday that there was
some big lag issues but I'm guessing
that's because I'm probably connecting
maybe to someone else's computer as I
noticed one of the players had had a
ping of zero so I'm guessing that
sometimes people will be able to host
these servers from the player base and
that means that you'll get input lag so
don't confuse that with stuttering
that's a different thing I mean the
graphics or the actual hardware side of
things where things are stuttering is
different to server side or input lag
and that and when this when these pings
were going terrible I was getting some
like you know teleporting and all that
crazy stuff that comes with it so don't
confuse that kind of stuttering with
hardware based stuttering which is what
we're looking at today but hopefully on
the server side of things things will
get pretty I mean I'd imagine that
they'd be fixed up I mean I've only had
that happen once so it depends on where
you live in the internet connections and
whatnot but I'm sure this is no
different to every other game in that
regard but honestly for what it's worth
Treyarch I'd like to see you fix these
things ASAP and really make this game a
enjoyable experience for PC players as
we do have a lot of face
in the Treyarch side of things when it
comes to cod anyway guys I hope this has
sold some of your problems if it has
please give this video a big fat like
and I'll be coming back to you guys
with more tech news and reviews and
gamma-rays subscribe to check your city
baby peas out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
