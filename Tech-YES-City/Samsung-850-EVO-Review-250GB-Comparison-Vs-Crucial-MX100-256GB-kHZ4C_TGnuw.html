the 850 Evo from Samsung and not only
that compare it to the crucial MX 100 to
find out which is the best SSD for the
money
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
techie I said his brain coming back to
you guys today with a video on SSDs now
when I did a review on the MX 100 from
crucial I gave it a really good review
and people were asking me Brian how does
the crucial drive compare against the
Samsung Drive of similar money
especially these two variants so I
decided hey when I recently had to
upgrade my workstation in the background
I decided to put a Samsung Evo in it and
not only that I decided to get the two
drives and put them head-to-head to see
which one truly is the value King now
today we have here the crucial MX 100
256 gigabyte version and we're going to
compare it against the samsung SSD 850
Evo 250 gigabyte version and I'm going
to run some quick synthetics and then
I'm going to do some real-world
benchmarks for you guys so the first
benchmark we're going to put up here is
a s SSD I love this benchmark it's my
favorite synthetic for testing SSDs it
gives you the numbers that you need to
know and it gives them to you pretty
quickly now the Samsung did edged out
slightly over the crucial MX 100 scoring
1111 points in this test as opposed to
the crucial MX 100 which scored 1062
though keep in mind these are still both
really good numbers especially for
drives that cost around about a hundred
dollars however it is important to note
that the Samsung did edged out the
crucial mainly in the sequential write
speeds we had their 334 megabytes
versus around about 490 megabytes so a
slight victory to the Samsung there in
the a s SSD benchmark so nice benchmark
we're going to do here is HD tune Pro
now I love this benchmark for testing
consistency of performance especially
consistency of advertised performance
now the crucial MX 100 performed really
well on this benchmark as you can see
from those read and write lines they're
perfectly straight there there's pretty
much no dips in those lines whatsoever
however keep in mind that I do run this
benchmark five times on the mix setting
with one gigabyte and I also pull up the
worst case scenario so all the
benchmarks that I ran on the MX 100 were
pretty much like this which means that
you're going to get a really consistent
performance
out of this drive when you're using it
in real-world applications especially
desktop intensive capture programs so
next up the Samsung 850 Evo and how did
it perform an HD tune Pro well it
performed really well as you can see
there the read and write speeds were
just soaring however there was one
slight dip there to 200 megabytes per
second this did have me a little bit
worried though with the next benchmark
we're going to see how it actually
affected the drive or did it affect the
drive let's find out so this next test
is a real-world test that I'm going to
start doing with all these drives that
come through here and pretty much what
it is is it's a real-world performance
test where I'm using a program called
camtasia studio to record 1440p desktop
at 30 frames per second and not only
that whilst at the same time recording
720p raw footage from my webcam and now
this is very intensive on the SSD if
you're using it as a temporary storage
drive which I recommend you do and now
if the drive is performing badly this
will manifest itself in audio video d
syncing and if this happens especially
this happens in this program it'll mean
that your footage is essentially useless
you'll have to spend a lot of time
trying to sync it up and it's a lot of
time wasted trust me I know from
experience so with this performance test
I decided to run it for 15 minutes and
then analyze the footage and see if
there was any audio and video that was
mismatched and the crucial MX 100
performed really well on this test
though the audio and video were
perfectly in sync the whole way through
the tests next up I ran this test on the
850 Evo and I'm delighted to report that
it performed perfectly there was no
video or audio desync there so this is a
great drive as well as the crucial so
let's get on to a conclusion so I came
into this review expecting there to be a
clear winner and what I got was two
clear winners both the MX 100 and the
850 Evo from Samsung are really good
drives for the money and honestly I
would get whichever one is cheaper at
the time of purchase as they both
performed really well not only in the
synthetic benchmarks but the real-world
benchmarks
where it matters though another thing I
will point out is that the crucial MX
100 is a silver themed SSD and it does
carry a three year warranty as opposed
to the Samsung which is a black themed
SSD and carries a five year warranty so
that's one thing you may wish to take
into consideration and honestly I think
that would be the main purchasing point
whichever one is going to cosmetically
match your rig better because they're
both awesome performers though for what
it's worth this Samsung Evo did edged
out the crucial MX 100 in those
synthetics especially on the sequential
write speeds other than that they're
both really good drives and they're both
going to serve your work station or your
gaming rig perfectly fine in the real
world so that's about it for today guys
