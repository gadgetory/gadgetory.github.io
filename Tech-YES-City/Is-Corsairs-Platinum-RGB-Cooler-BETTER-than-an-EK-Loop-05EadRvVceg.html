my 9900 k review they saw I was coupling
it with that H 100 I Pro and although it
did okay it wasn't their best offering
and after this they decided to send me
over there H 115 i Platinum which not
only has new and improved RGB bling both
with the 140 ml ml fans but also has a
bigger taller block and a new and
improved cold plate which I can say does
indeed help with cooling performance but
speaking of cooling performance today
we'll be testing out this cooler
comparing it against an ek custom water
loop as well as H 100 I Pro and a big
air cooler from cooler master on the
9900 K at 5 gigahertz in the 25 degree
ambient controlled environment
welcome back to tag yes City right here
we have the Platinum the new and
improved upgraded edition so Corsair are
not just promising an acetic upgrade
including some fancy RGB bling with the
fans they've also promised better
cooling performance from the actual
block itself and so mounting this on the
9900 K at 5 gigahertz this CPU by the
way puts out a lot of hate 200 watts on
a small ring boss dies so that is a lot
of heat to keep under control and
pulling out the temperature results for
you guys straight away comparing it
head-to-head with the previous cooler
that I had here the only cooler that had
in the studio that could keep the 9900 K
under wraps at these temperatures was
the ek waterblock solution now I've
actually got another CPU in another 99
hundred K which is soldered so I decided
to do the testing on that as opposed to
my deal it at CPU so the numbers may
differ from my original deleted video
where there were a little bit lower
after I deleted but regardless I want to
keep this more real world where someone
going out buying a 9900 k with the
solder on it's probably not gonna deal
it it and hence if ever gonna get an
all-in-one solution like this and want
to know how it performs so testing it
straight away against the ek waterblock
solution 98 degrees and that came in
with a noise of 58 decibels with its
fans on Macs and this is what I used in
the review if you haven't seen that
already I'll put the link up here then
we have the H 59 platinum and we've got
two results here because we've got Mac's
fan speeds which came in at 95 degrees
so beat out the ek waterblock solution
which is much more expensive by the way
than this solution here coming in at 170
USD but then we had the fans on the
out-of-the-box quiet mode as well and I
got 101 degrees at these settings which
I was honestly blown away because the
noise levels were 34 decibels at these
settings which was incredibly
whisper-quiet I had to turn my main rig
off just to get an accurate reading and
that's over a meter away from where I
was doing the tests and that was on idle
as well and so immediately coming out of
this the Platinum definitely is improved
over the previous h1 10 that I'm using
in my main rig when we put this up on
the test that got 99 degrees
with a hundred percent fan speeds on its
included 140mm fans so it's beating out
the previous generation but it's also
beating out the H 100 I Pro as well
which is a 240 ml solution and if you
haven't seen the original review that
actually failed at 5 gigahertz it
couldn't keep the 9900 K at 5 minutes
under control and so in this test it got
110 degrees before it actually throttled
and it couldn't complete the tests and
that was with noise levels of 59
decibels moving over to the ma 620 P
which is cool masters air cooler very
solid build quality I do like this thing
especially for its price performance -
and that was getting a hundred and ten
degrees and it suffered the same fate as
the H 110 I've Pro but that had 55
decibels in terms of its noise levels so
that tapped out as well the H 100 I Pro
tapped out so when it comes to the
latest and greatest CPU from Intel
you're definitely gonna want to get some
good cooling if you want to get a high
overclock like 5 gigahertz for example
and now this is the 2nd 9900 K I have
here so they both of them need around
1.3 5 volt at 5 gigahertz so maybe I'm
just losing the silicon lottery a second
time in a row but ultimately just like
the motherboard reviews that I've done
it was good to see that when we're
putting out more heat components like
this platinum cooler and the
motherboards are tested on their V RMS
for example can handle the heat that
this CPU puts out so in ways I'm kind of
glad that I'm giving you guys a
worst-case scenario with the advice on
whether this cooler can handle it and it
passed with flying colors I'm really
impressed by this to the point where I'm
going to be getting another one of these
putting in my main rig and then keeping
this one for a test bench because the
cooling performance as we said just
before was beating out that of the ek
waterblock solution and that is much
more expensive
so one 70 USD especially compared to
previous generations it does have a
steeper asking price but they've
improved the cooling performance and the
RGB bling I'm not gonna lie it does look
really good the 140 mil ml RGB fans do a
phenomenal job of staying quiet but also
having the individual zone lighting as
well as the block that you can control
in the IQ software and just opening up
the IQ software I can seriously
get lost in this for days if you've got
a Corsair mouse keyboard and RGB mouse
pad and RAM and also a RGB corsair
headset for example you can link all
this up in the software and then make
really cool effects for example I did
the visor and sequential settings with a
layer over the top of each other and it
added a really cool like static effect
where the lighting then came over that
and it just looked really cool so you
can set up all these custom effects in
the software itself and then have all
your RGB core set devices linked so to
speak and it will make for some really
cool effects another cool feature with
the software as well is that you can use
the RGB to monitor temperatures where
you can have green as safe orange is
getting hot and then red as danger zone
and you can control the individual
temperatures as well in the software
itself
anyways wrapping up this review with
Corsair they include a five-year
warranty the prices we said before is
170 USD in Australia it's 224 Aussie so
I'm glad to see that corset is fixing
the Aussie pricing so they're definitely
listening to feedback and that means
that Aziz can get a decent deal and
we're not so jealous of the US pricing
especially when we look at it in terms
of Triple P compared to that of the US
dollar but ultimately the build quality
the installation it was all the breeze
there's no sharp edges so you won't bust
your thumb up like I've done here on
previous other PC parts here in the
studio and also there's AMD installation
as well if you want to get a.m. for
rising as well so there are all these
guys five-year warranty solid build
quality got the blink to match and the
improved cooling performance beating
that of a custom water solution with its
fans on 100% so really impress what
Corsair have done here of course you've
got that 170 dollar USD price tag that
of course is expensive but with anything
premium you're gonna pay a premium and
if you're getting a 99 hundred K you're
certainly gonna want to get something
like this cooler here on the bench to
keep that thing under wraps especially
if you want to get it to 5 key cards but
you guys hope you enjoyed this one if
you did then be sure to hit that like
button and let us know in the comment
section below what you think of the RGB
Platinum Series do you want to get one
or do you just think RGB is too much for
you in
20:18 love reading your thoughts and
opinions as always and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye to the point where you could
probably write your name in these zones
and at these low noise look and these No
welcome back to tech yesterday let's get
straight into some temperature figures
for you guys with the H 159 Platinum
what would like to take your city
can you stop banging ladders and
everything I'm trying to record a video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
