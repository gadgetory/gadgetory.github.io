you guys have requested the used PC
builds and today I'm giving you yet
another build this is a three hundred
and twenty seven dollar used PC build
welcome back to tech est this is brian
coming to you guys today with the
Westmere Dominator this is the 32
nanometer twenty dollar CPU that has
four cores
eight threads and it's an absolute beast
there is one problem though you have to
get the x58 motherboard which is usually
a little bit expensive but I managed to
pick up one for pretty cheap so without
further ado I'll go through all the
parts that I'm going to be using on this
build today so starting from top to
bottom we have the case and power supply
this is an Animax case and I managed to
pick up this with a power supply for
twenty dollars never heard of that brand
of sue before but it does provide 480
watts on the 12 volt line below that we
have two 250 gigabyte hard drives which
we picked up shipped for $50 to the left
that we have 12 gigabytes of ddr3 memory
which we picked up for 53 dollars
shipped and then to the left of that is
the most special part of this build this
is the e 50 640 which we picked up for
$19 this is a 4 core 8 threaded CPU 32
nanometer CPU this is what's going to
make this build such a powerhouse today
and then over to the right of the scene
there we have the r9 270x which was had
for around about $95 so very cheap there
and a very capable card below that we
have an x58 motherboard as rock extreme
3 which actually came with a I 7 920
which I'm yet to try out that came in at
a hundred and eleven dollars shipped
then besides that last part of the build
is the thermal write cooler which I
managed to pick up with a fan for 10
dollars shipped so that brings the total
of this build to $320 and we can still
sell the i7 920 and recoup some of the
cost back without further ado let's
clean up these parts and see how this
bad boy runs or even if it does run
No
okay so before we put this in the rig
we're just going to test it out and make
sure that it fires up and it's all okay
and then we shall after that start doing
the build so let's give it a try now
this actually has a power button on
board so I don't have to short any pins
with a USB stick like I usually do but
let's see if we get a signal so if I
should got a bias code right out there
and yeah this board looks like it's
working absolutely fine and see there
we've got to boot there just going to
check the bias P 2.8 as well so it's got
the latest blasts on it so we won't
actually have to flash the blouse as
well so it's all ready to go this I 7
920 is good to change and let's see if
the zeon works on this so anyway this
time we'll actually put a cooler on the
heatsink I do not recommend you do that
like seriously at all
because you will overheat your CPU in no
time I was just lucky that I turned it
off pretty much straight away
so hopefully this boots up this is the e
650 640 so a new type of CPU and
hopefully it works okay this is working
cool saasy on e 5640 is being recognized
there in the BIOS and
turn that away and we're good to go so
it's been recognized and we can start
doing the build now memory is being
recognized too which is awesome
Hey
like
yes
you
you
so there we have it the three hundred
and twenty dollar Westmere PC is just
absolutely killing it at 1080p csgo over
two hundred frames per second GTA 5 and
Just Cause 3 which are like two of the
latest titles are just being handled
absolutely fine at 1080p on a blend of
medium and high settings there and then
I am just absolutely impressed with what
this build has to offer and keep in mind
I still have to sell the i7 920 so that
will probably bring this whole build
under $300 and at that price I would
have to say that this is by far my
favorite build today with the
performance being really snappy and some
of the things I've done there like
overclocking and raid zeroing the two
hard drives make it even that much
faster to date now another thing that
makes this whole build so good is the
$15 e 56 40s you guys could see there it
is an absolute beast of the CPU scoring
around 10k in the physics core in 3d
fire strike also another thing is that
there is no i7 variant of this CPU which
makes it relatively unknown on the
overclocking scene or even in the
enthusiast taxine though you will have
to get an x58 motherboard which costs
around about $100 I was lucky enough to
pick up an asrock extreme 3 with the i7
924 round about that price shipped and
everything worked perfectly fine also
another thing with the power supply
since it didn't have the proper
proprietary cables I had to splice off 4
wires off my ATX 24 pin and even though
I don't recommend this it's still got
the job done and I was able to save
money and not have to go out and buy
another power supply because this power
supply is quiet it does push a lot of
air and it does give out a decent amount
of power especially on that 12 volt line
though that's about it for me today guys
if you enjoyed these used PC builds and
you not really hit that like button

coming back to you guys
