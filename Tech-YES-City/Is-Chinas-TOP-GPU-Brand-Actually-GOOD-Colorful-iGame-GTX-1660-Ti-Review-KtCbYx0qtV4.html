I've tested tech products
here at Tech Yes City,
and reviewed them for you guys.
I've always been alluded by
one brand and that's Colorful,
where apparently they are the
number one brand in China,
for Nvidia graphics cards.
But right here on the desk with a 1660 Ti,
which is a triple fence solution,
has a back plate and is pretty lengthy,
coming in at 295 mil long,
as the standard 112 mil
thickness dual slot cooler,
and the best thing is
it's coming in at MSRP,
in Australia you can currently
pick this up for $449
on eBay,
but with that said is this
brand worthy of your money,
and is there a reason that
this is number one in China.
(people talking)
Let's find out by putting it through all
the Tech Yes paces and also comparing
it against the Galax variant,
of 1660 Ti.
(soft symphonic music)
Let's roll those benchmarks.
(moves into fast electronic music)
So there's all the numbers
that we needed to test
to give you guys a solid conclusion,
with the iGame here from Colorful,
and straight away I'm
going to say I can see
the appeal with this card.
It's got two outer 90 mil
fans and in 80 mil fan,
weighs in at 810 grams,
includes a back plate,
has the display options that
you'd need especially at MSRP,
with HDMI 2.0 out, DVI
and display port 1.4 out.
And it also has a turbo button,
which you can turn on and off.
I'm presuming that gives
you a little bit of a boost,
but when I tested the numbers
in Shadow of the Tomb Raider,
it literally made no
difference to performance,
where I was left scratching my head
what the button actually does.
When we manually overclock the card,
we got some very good
results but we could see,
that the GDR6 that they're using here
is clock down to 6,000 megahertz,
as opposed to your RTX 2060 for example,
where it's at 7,001
megahertz out of the box.
So were able to get 1,500 on the slider,
in Afterburner which gives us,
technically a big overclock,
but when we think about it
it's not that huge it's really,
plus 500 megahertz on those mem clocks.
The clocks did mediocre,
which allowed the card the boost
to around 2,500 megahertz,
but when we drop the fan
speeds it did drop down
to 2,400 megahertz.
Speaking of the fan
noises and temperatures,
the Colorful card here did pretty solid.
We had a 26 degree ambient temperature,
and we got 58 decibels, at
100% fan speed 60 degrees,
80% saw 52 decibels,
64 degrees and 60 percent was
where the auto fans speeds
actually ironically
landed exactly as well,
and that scored 68 and 69 degrees,
and the reason we got a
one degree drops is because
the fan speeds actually
do fluctuate slightly,
and that causes a one degree drop where
it goes between 58 to 60%
So when it goes down to 58 percent,
we do get that one degree
drop if that makes any sense.
But looking at the gaming figures
and going through the
list of the games here,
there wasn't really any standout results.
This card performed where it should be.
It was slightly better,
than the Galax card out of the box,
and then of course the overclocks did give
it a sizable boost,
but keep in mind that
we could overclock any
of these cards in this graph,
and it will give us a roughly 10% boost,
just like we saw in
the Colorful card here.
But looking at the power
consumption figures
although we got a little
bit more performance
we also got more power consumption,
compared to the Galax variance.
So we do have an extra fan on board,
and of course I know from
experience that Galax tune
their gravest cards for efficiency first.
The power limit on this card is also 120%
so when we overclocked
it the power consumption,
did increase with regards to that limit.
So this now brings us
to conclusion time with
the Colorful iGame 1660 Ti.
Now one thing I can say from this sample
is that Colorful are a solid brand like,
I wasn't blown away by this
graphics card but also on
the same token I couldn't
really pinpoint anything,
that was bad about this card.
Input outputs are okay.
Temperatures and noise are okay.
The card has a nice really
matte black carbon aesthetic,
also has an RGB logo on
the side and a back plate,
for MSRP pricing.
So that's the appeal of this card.
It's sort of got what the
more expensive options have,
but it's coming in at MSRP.
But this turbo button on the back
I really didn't see the need for it,
especially when you can
just go into Afterburner,
and just change and manually
overclock things yourself,
and get much better results.
But there are all these guys
with Colorful, China's number one brand,
the card that I had here
today is a solid example of
a 1660 Ti, but also on that same note,
I can't tell you if the
2080 Ti from Colorful,
is any good or not as I haven't tested it.
This card here does check out,
and if you're in Australia,
and you can get it for a good
price, well below MSRP on
a sale for instance on eBay
and it's definitely going
to be a worthy purchase,
if you're in the USA
or if you're in the UK,
I couldn't really find it
for sale at a good price.
I guess Colorful haven't
started distributing
to those areas yet,
they're probably focusing on Australia,
since it is part of Asia.
I mean I've just taken a guess here but,
for the record Australia number one,
and I hope you guys enjoyed
this video if you did
and be sure
(lively trance music)
to hit that like button,
let us know in the comments
section below what you think
of the 1660 Ti from Colorful,
the iGame variant.
Love reading your thoughts
and opinions as always,
and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon.
