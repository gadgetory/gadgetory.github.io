possibly a series for you guys where I
just tell you everything that's going on
with the channel upcoming videos and
also these things that are all on my
mind so this is the yes vlog
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
check yes it is brian coming back to you
guys today with kind of like a new
series possibly if you guys like it then
make sure you let me know in the comment
section below where I just tell you well
really everything that's going on the
channel at the moment so probably
wondering what all these boxes are in
the background that's what I'm going to
explain and then I'm also going to talk
about some things that in recent videos
and stuff that I stuff that's on my mind
basically so first things first this bad
boy here this is the 980 TI and I've
picked this up in electric city for a
pretty good price I mean when you
compare it to America so i got it for
around 900 aud or ninety thousand yen
which is a little bit over 700 USD and
it has a custom cooler on it which is
what I was looking for so it was pretty
much a hundred dollars cheaper than any
other 980 TI I could get in Japan and
that was even reference cool so I was
after an aftermarket cooling solution
and that's great and it's got a mouse
mat included so that's the selling point
I guess but it's from inno3d and I've
actually never tried a gravis car from
inno3d and I don't see many reviews so
it's great to give sort of the underdog
a chance and see how they perform so I'm
really looking forward to giving you
guys this video where I'm going to be
comparing it to the GTX 970 g1 then out
of the box settings and overclock
settings at 1440p and 4k and we'll see
how it goes so that will shall be
interesting because I'll see how high
this graphics card goes but it looks
pretty cool already so I actually
haven't opened it yet I teased it on
twitter twitter twitter twitter early
before so if you guys want you can check
me out on twitter too for the latest
updates and where I'm just constantly
not constantly but I'm kind of casually
tweeting stuff out and letting you guys
know updates about stuff ok this is the
casual vlog I'm not cutting this at all
so let's keep moving on here this is the
SHP 9500 s from philips now I am I guess
if i'm a fanboy of something i'm a
fanboy of philips house sound I mean
every Phillips pair of headphones I've
had come through here so far has been
really good i just love their house
sound it's like a warm sound where you
got good base you've got good meds
coming through and the treble is always
just seems to be just right with phil
headphones the x1's had good treble
these have good treble and then the l
ones they have good treble as well like
they're not overpowering but they're
present and so these have that same sort
of sound signature almost drop the box
but one thing i will get out the way is
is that there no x1 like people are
comparing these two the x1 and I think
the X ones are just on that different
level still I mean they're very good for
the money extremely good I mean pick
them up for like 50 USD there an
absolute bargain at that price they kind
of compared to the L ones though the old
ones have a little bit more Richard base
which I prefers well don't stay tuned
for a review because these things
coupled with the v-moda boom probe man
they're amazing so next thing we've got
here i'm going to do like some michael
jordan backflip here we've got hit an x
99 extreme 63.1 now I've actually
finished up the review for this I just
have to do all the video editing and
it's like video editing is like the
hardest part of doing YouTube videos for
you guys I just like another five hours
just straight in front of a monitor
editing a video so that's how long it
takes me to roughly edit a video review
like a motherboard review it's about 15
minutes long I guess something round
about that I get I'm guessing so stay
tuned for that and another good thing
about this motherboard is I'm going to
be giving it away for you guys so stay
tuned for that I'll be announcing more
details in the near future about this
giveaway so stay tuned for that now next
thing up here we've got the sound
blaster ii 5 from creative and now they
sent this there goes the box but they
sent me this over as a review sample and
ma'am I'm impressed like this is
creative what well being creative so
that's awesome so I'm really impressed
with this so far i'm going to be
reviewing it for you guys though it's
really interesting to see creative of
getting on their game i mean especially
when i tried some of their products
before and i thought they were kind of
mediocre this however on the other hand
is a really good product so i'm going to
be reviewing that soon I've actually
done all the b-roll I've just got to get
that out the way the actual review done
so last but not least we'll move on to
the Fidelio l ones i actually have a
spare pair of these I found these buried
in my house
and I'm going to be giving these away so
not in the near future i'll be giving
away the extreme six in the near future
but i'll be probably doing a review like
because i actually don't think i've done
a review on these and so i will compare
these in a review maybe a headphone
shootout a philips in-house headphone
shootout that'd be pretty cool so let me
know if you want to see that so they'll
be interesting or if you just want to
see the SHP 9500 review so let me know
that the description below so let's move
on now to the next section and this is
where everything's on my mind and I got
to tell you guys some extra thoughts
about videos that I recently did
especially so I recently did the nvidia
control panel video and that was met
with a lot of positive feedback so thank
you guys for that a lot of people ask me
about anti-aliasing and asked me to do a
video explaining all the different types
of anti-aliasing so I might do that in
the near future after I get all these
boxes out of here and reviewed and some
other videos too but that's definitely
on the list to do so thanks for that
also overclocking monitors and one thing
with that I will say with overclocking
monitors is be very careful one thing I
didn't say in the video yesterday or two
days ago was that if you're overclocking
a monitor make sure that you're not
getting skipping frames so this will
rear its ugly head in the real world in
the form of you're not seeing what's
happening but it's actually registering
so if you're in an FPS game for instance
you may be shooting a gun but you can't
see the bullets but your enemies died
and so that'll that'll mean use frames
are skipping so if you're in a MOBA for
example like dota 2 and your hero like
toss you'll be shooting out some ice
shards and you won't see the ice shards
on your screen but they will register
and they will actually hit the enemy so
that's something to be careful of there
if you're getting skipping frames you
may wish to check your settings in game
and make sure that the actual game is
registering the refresh rate of your
monitor and also that your settings are
not skipping you can do it on browsers
but I find browsers can be the browser
tests can be buggy it may not actually
show off your frames or skipping or not
and if you are getting skipping frames
after overclock your monitor and you
can't do anything about it then you just
want to revert back to
original settings that's probably the
best thing to do there though I will
look into it a lot more for you guys
though just be careful of skipping
frames also as for MSA and SMA they're
my two favorite forms of anti-aliasing
at the moment and thanks for the insight
provided about em FAA from the guys in
the comments and I will be also ya doing
those reviews for you guys very soon so
