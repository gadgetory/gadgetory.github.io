this is my kind of a Venn ln2
overclocking performance matters this is
a World Tour now this has ended up in
Australia and where do we start off but
first of all I'm joined by Josh my good
friend how you doing man I'm doing
bloody good mate how about yourself
doing really well its first event where
I can come back well the first video I
can do were kind of a beer relax and do
a bit of ln2 overclocking myself and
that's what it's all about you know
Aussies have been the pioneers of liquid
nitrogen in one hand and beer in the
other and that's what we're all about
especially for the team a you boys and
we've had ten years of team a you just
smashing world records and we're here at
the fourth stock for the HW bot World
Tour so it's been in Las Vegas it's been
in Taipei Taiwan it's been in Moscow
Russia and now here it is in Melbourne
Australia that's right this Melbourne is
beautiful and behind me we've got a
number the number one streamer in
Australia and she is streaming on an L n
2 PCI overclocked right now 8700 K yeah
that's right so we've got an 80 700 K
overclocked to 6 gigahertz on 6 cores 12
threads smashing that out we've got Matt
0+0
looking after the Ellen - he's from Team
a you all the while we've got looser
fruit just pumping out the content on
Twitch
it's all happening dude basically that
means like if we can stream and play
games while we're using Ellen - I guess
it's not that scary right people think
Ellen - were just gone for World Records
it's going to just crash it's not
practical but this is kind of bringing a
practical sense to overclocking but I
mean lnto is pretty dangerous but hey
you can still get massive performance 6
gigahertz 1.5 volt - that's right that's
right so we're running 6 gigahertz 1.5
volts in yeah it may be a little bit
impractical you've got to have a mate
there to pour the pot and you know make
sure you get the temperatures right but
the cool thing is what we're doing 6
gigahertz you know 6 cores 12 threads
it's this rad who's done this before
exactly right not only that I guess it
maybe promotes innovation - right maybe
hey we see what we're getting with this
maybe someone can bring a bridge in
between selling this more proud I mean
phase is very loud right
so maybe someone can invent a cooler
that does this and we can get that extra
performance we don't have to wait for
these next generations of CPUs just
please give us something we don't have
to wait for that and that's the really
cool thing about sub-zero's that we get
to see performance levels that you may
not actually see on air until another
two or three years so it's really great
sort of indicator as to what the future
holds and as you said phase change
calling for those of you that don't know
it's sort of you know refrigeration tech
and you're looking at about minus 35
minus 45 degrees constant and I've been
playing around with that for about last
15 years or so and yeah you know if you
can run 24/7 systems like that but it's
loud beautiful thing about liquid
nitrogen it's really cold and it's
completely quiet so here we are now at
the extreme overclocking booth they are
breaking World Records here I got Ellen
to blowing in my face like the that's
just the cold air isn't it that's it
dude that's it so that's just cold air
because Ellen 2 evaporates so quickly
that's not actually Ellen to vapor
that's the air condensing and making a
whole lot of vapor in itself science so
what world records do we have here on
display all right so the boys have been
pushing through with the 8700 K at 7.1
gigahertz we've done 3dmark o six world
record they've just equaled the 3dmark o
five world record and they're pushing
through to take that number one spot
oh damn somebody saved me now let me
just get out of here take that 8700 K
with me the Ellen 2 included so I can
start doing some extreme benchmarks
myself solutely dude I mean who wants to
take it home we all do right so we got
also the motherboard on display is the
Auris Z 370 they're using g.skill memory
too and now this is the funny thing
right they're using that horas graphics
card with the water resistance on it
built-in so that's actually helping with
their overclocking right like so there's
no moisture below I'm sure because
condensation is a massive issue when
you're dealing with liquid nitrogen
overclocked platforms and so we just
want to keep it as dry as a burn so we
can just keep smashing out the results
and we're dealing here with a special
engineering sample of the SOC force or
overclocking motherboards so it's a
first look it's a it's getting
absolutely hammered and you know the
boys are just tweaking it so that when
it gets to you go
it's perfect Wow so that is pretty
amazing coming out here the stream
overclocker called hi cookie hi cookie
the extreme overclockers called hi
cookie is benchmarking at the moment and
he's from Taiwan he's a really good
overclock all right
that's it so hi cookie is gigabyte or
is's in-house performance tuner and he's
teamed up here with James aka young Pro
from Team au they're enjoying some beers
along with some liquid nitrogen and just
developing a great time here we go guys
I'm gonna try a bit out myself I think
try bill this Ellen to stuff out and
we'll see how we go
so I just finished doing a bit of
overclocking myself keeping those
temperatures between minus 130 to 135
that seems to be the sweet spot but also
we saw a world record broken again on 3d
mark oh five those guys went crazy they
celebrated with champagne it was off the
chain I even got a demonstration of how
to pour liquid nitrogen on your hand
that's it dude and you know there's all
sorts of craziness going on here we've
got six gigahertz streaming PCs 7.1
gigahertz world record runs but what's
really important is during PAX Joshi got
a Yoshi there we go guys Joshi got a
Yoshi but on a serious note guys this
was just a lot of fun one of the best
events I've been to at a technology
invent hands down I love the atmosphere
here I'm definitely gonna be getting
into a bit of more extreme overclocking
myself and Josh is gonna probably teach
me how to do that no doubt to the team a
you boys are more than happy to step in
show you a bit of guidance you guys
enjoyed today's video then you know what
to do hit that like button drop a
comment in the comment section below if
you want to see some more extreme
overclocking or more vlogs like this at
the event I absolutely love this event
and I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon peace out for now and
have a good time limits keep pushing the
limits pushing the limits bye
I'm joined by Johnny how you doing man
very well very well
he's a pub cheap labor and in 30 seconds
what do you think of tonight tonight is
awesome there's Alan - there's beer the
stream is there's games it is going off
it's really cool we're joined by Alex
how you doing man pretty good man thank
you
he is a custom casemod he does some
really good work is actually gonna help
me on an upcoming project - there's a
little teaser but what do you think
about tonight brother I'm so yeah I'm
learning all sorts of things about
overclocking like you know there's not
just about you know pouring some melon -
over the CPU and you're just going with
it but it's like you know maintaining
that that you know sort of temperature
depending one type of frequency you want
to hit so I you know you have to
maintain it between a certain type of
temperature sorry yeah so now we got
Ross from a gigabyte slash horas he just
looks like well man you you're repping
hard there did you walk your walking
advertisement yeah definitely you know
like I just want to say this hoodie is a
it's got one on the left one on the
front one on the back one on the right
its maximum salad status hoodie I'll
hook you up with one Brian I'll get you
something I can't turn down a free
hoodie guys here I am joined by blondie
how you doing not so bad man enjoying
myself here at the Intel event beer
liquid nitrogen nerd talk what's not to
love
so now joined it by James extreme over
go you don't a good man how are you I'm
good brother I saw that overclocked
before they break in those world records
that was some top-notch stuff so we've
been working on that all day that's I
don't know 24 hours sort of work right
there so it just all sort of come
together at the last minute and yeah so
we took the 3d Marko five world record
with 7.1 gigahertz and one point nine
volts there we go there they're gonna
teach me how to do this stuff so I can
get into it a little bit I would never
get near their level but I definitely
want to maybe one day I could reach
seven Giga hood you'll reach seven
gigahertz coming right now and we'll
show you how it's done all right there
we go guys I'm going in right now but
bringing a beer maybe this you did
dangerous
thanks thanks rolling all right no rice
thanks man</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
