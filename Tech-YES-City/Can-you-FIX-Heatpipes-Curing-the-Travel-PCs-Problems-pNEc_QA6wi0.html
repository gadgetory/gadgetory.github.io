I made a mistaken that I busted the he
punch when I was soaring that cooler to
fit in my SD 13 B Silverstone Mini ITX
case though it brought about a lingering
question can you fix heat pipes on a
budget if not then what else can you do
to fix this problem let's take a look
when I bought the cheapest gtx 1070 i
could find I ran into one problem the
cooler wasn't clear in the front of the
case and instead of hacking up the case
which wasn't an option since I had to
clear customs of further four times with
it I decided to make the cooler fit
instead since it overextended the stock
gtx 1070 PCB size though after i did
this the card was thermal throttling and
this was a problem since you won't be
getting the performance you paid for
especially on a gtx 1070 however now
that I'm back with my tools and the like
I decided to fill the heat pipes with
initially hydro carbon and then quickly
seal it
this initial experiment failed and the
card was still hitting the thermal
throttle limit quite quickly I did a
second round but this time oil in the
pipes same result the two heat pipes on
this card were just not coming back to
life not to worry though no harm was
done to the PCB which is the most
important part of a graphics card and
seriously never attempt to model PCB
unless you know what you're doing and
have experience with doing such things
so he pipes they can't be fixed with
your typical ghetto hack methods though
let's try putting a five-dollar sif cool
that I found in a junk bin in Japan over
six months ago on this little bad boy
Oh
Oh
Oh
so there we have it six dollars in total
for this solution it also happens to fit
in my Mini ITX rig when I put it in the
Mini ITX rig de temps were a bit higher
though even with overclocking I was
hitting around max 70 degrees and on
that note this was the best overclocks
I've seen on a gtx 1070 on air thus far
so it speaks lengths for how good some
of these aftermarket cooling solutions
are especially when you compare it to a
gigabyte cooler with only two heat pipes
on there or two busted heat pipes though
I know what you're thinking not everyone
has access to the five dollar coolers in
a junk bin for some fatigue store in
Japan so for this other solution I am
going to mount an arctic s1 + goofy
style on this graphics card and also use
there's old fans from that gigabyte
heatsink and then throw it in the bin
and see what we can do
Oh
Oh
so after putting this arctic cooler
through its paces it did go over sixty
degrees there so performing a little bit
worse than the South cooler and also
being a lot larger so with that note I
decided to stick with the Seth cooler
and then put on some vrm and MOSFET heat
sinks so it's going to be a permanent
solution in the Mini ITX rig so there we
have it if you brake heat pipes there's
generally no coming back from it that is
the cooler is screwed unless you have
some really specialized gear which is
beyond the scope of this channel and
myself it is also generally why older
laptops have lots of problems because
they work predominantly off heat pipes
and if those hit bikes even have a
miniscule amount of degradation then the
cooling will be severely affected in my
case the card was only thermal
throttling and in easy to play games
like dota 2 it was having no problems
whatsoever nothing to really worry about
because this was only a band-aid
solution until I got back here so on
that note of modding and heat pipes the
only time you really have to worry as if
your card is thermal tripping if this
happens you have to double check
everything to make sure your cooler is
working properly
for example the fans are working the
case is not suffocated and the cooler is
making proper contact with the graphics
card or CPU as that is what can cause
permanent damage to your gear and lastly
I'm also sorry if I offended anyone on
the PC master-race forum the last thing
I'd want to do is rub fellow PC gamers
up the wrong way and there's also a lot
of good people on there who are very
knowledgeable so I'm again I'm sorry
about the mistakes that I made also
learned in the process to that heat
pipes differ greatly depending on the
company apparently having a stone
pressurized in the pipes is best for
thermal conductivity on PC parts
interesting perhaps it explains why
Arctic's bigger coolers are so damn good
anyways I hope you enjoyed this video if
you did then hit that like button and
let me know in the comment section below
have you done any crazy experiments on
CPUs or GPUs before we'd love to hear
your comment as always and I'll catch
you in the next tag video very soon he's
out for now bye nothing much mate just
busting some 8 pipes
where's-where's to me before
