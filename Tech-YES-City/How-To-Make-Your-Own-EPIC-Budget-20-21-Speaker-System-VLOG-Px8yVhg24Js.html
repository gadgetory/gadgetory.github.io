of an off project with you guys this is
me building a dirty 2.1 setup for my
computer so as you can see here in my
computer don't look at my desktop though
it's really messy but I've got 2.0
speakers here these were uncurse
speakers that I picked up for about $20
for the pair of them this was at some
used parts place now they're being
powered by the x7 and now the thing
about the x7 with the combo there x7
speakers the e/m use well they are
really good but they were just a 2.0
setup they weren't a 2.1 setup and I
kind of wanted a bit of base and so this
is going to bring me to my next little
friend went down to my favorite use
parts place I saw this I was like wow
okay it's a it looks okay it's a sub and
it's pretty much an amplifier in one
kind of like like most two point one
speakers to set up so this was only 15
dollars and it's got 35 watts output at
6 ohms so that's going to be perfect for
the onkyo speakers and yeah so we're
just going to unbox this thing and hook
it up and see if we can make a decent
2.1 system for only $35 as we can see
here it kind of looks brand-new which
was surprising I mean I paid only $15
for it it's not the best looking thing I
mean the color scheme is really weird
we've got like oak wood silver and black
but uh I mean the controller looks a
little bit faded but I guess that's just
been sitting in the box for a long time
so we're going to boot it up plug it in
and see if it works ok so I plugged
everything in and now the rear of the
audio out but I'm going to use a
headphone splitter and now what this
will allow me to do is get two
connections out of one and the good
thing is is that when I'm using my
headphones I just turned my 2.1 system
off and vice versa
using the two-point-one system then I
can just turn the volume straight all
the way down on the headphone receiver
there that's this little thing here so
we've got some trouble in paradise here
the onkyo speakers when I check them
they're actually four ohm speakers and
now this is a bit of a problem because
generally with amplifiers you don't want
to run under the Pacific own so for
instance this two point one system I've
got here is rated at 6 ohms output and
so generally you can go the other way
like you can go higher impedance is fine
but lower impedance is generally a big
no-no this is from memory however that's
not a problem we've got some three
dollar Sony junk speakers here which are
rated at 8 ohms so I'm going to wire
these up and see if we can then get this
thing working properly brothers the
moment you have all been waiting for I
am going to turn on the I don't even
know what to call this thing I might
call it the Majesta because it's like
magic hopefully anyway let's turn it on
so we plugged it all in it's all good to
go and I think it's working like I hear
the speakers pop and I'll try this
remote see if there yeah there we go the
remote works as well I'll just see yep
turns off oh wow cool so it's got memory
as well so it remembers that I put it on
auxilary as well so let's turn on some
beats and see how honestly though see
how this $20.00 combo will go because I
am coupling it with the Sony speakers
which were a lot cheaper than the onkyo
so technically it is a $20 2.1 system
so anyway moment of truth how do these
how does it sound I'm just going to put
on a track now I'll just use that song I
used in my 6600 K benchmarks because
it's on my desktop and you know YouTube
won't take it down from copyright so
let's just turn that on and see how hard
this thing goes okay so it's working you
guys can be the judge with me so here's
my standard tone of my voice is how it
okay drop the microphone that happens
when you're vlogging okay so I drop the
mic sorry so we got it working now and
it is on 35 the volume so let's crack
this baby up and this is like this is my
normal voice
so this is how I speak in all my reviews
and stuff so
whoa damn this thing can go so hard like
I was only up to 60 and the floor was
starting to shake
so go floor shaking bass and the sony
sound wicked
ladies and gentlemen let's tie this up
and do some cable management quickly
clean this baby up and we'll go to a
conclusion so after a bit of cable
management and vacuum cleaning I was
then set to enjoy my now $20 2.1 sound
system and I got to tell you guys
straight up for the money this thing is
ridiculously good and I can highly
recommend this route unlike my $40 PC
which kind of I had a lot of trouble
with this thing on the other hand I can
highly recommend I was so surprised by
how good the bass and the mids were on a
cheap system like this and one thing to
keep in mind is if you're building a
budget system you should always try to
overpower your speakers so generally if
you're under powering your speakers they
sound terrible I don't know how many
times people have messaged me saying
Brian why don't my high impedance
expensive hard to drive headphones sound
good
what are you powering them from my
onboard audio there you go so in this
case I think they're 20 watt speakers
and they're getting fed 35 amps of power
from the amp which makes them sound
ridiculously good I was surprised I
didn't think $3 speakers could sound
that good now keep in mind I did waste
$20 on the onkyo speakers because I
thought hey they're more expensive
they're going to sound better but the
Sony's the $3 junk Sony speakers that I
found and this $15 amp that I found
together makes a great combo and I can
highly recommend it to someone on a
budget even to someone who wants some
good sound and good value for money
sound like Wow anyway so guys you love
to see these little vlogs that I do and
this is one that is just an absolute
epic win and I even tidied up my
mousepad while I was at it so I've
managed to save another few years off
buying another mousepad so I don't know
I don't know why I enjoy these things
but I just do so arrey guys if you like
this video please give it a thumbs up
and I will be testing back
old motherboards in the $40 pills that
didn't boil how great s that for you
guys and let you know before us anyway
