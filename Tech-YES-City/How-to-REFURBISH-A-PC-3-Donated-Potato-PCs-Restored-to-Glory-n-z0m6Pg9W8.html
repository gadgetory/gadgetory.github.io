price-performance and right here on the
desk we got donated just today -
brand-new potatoes well they actually
not brand-new but they're used and we're
going to refurbish them and switch parts
around because I've ready got another
potato laying around that has a p5q
deluxe in it and it's got no RAM but it
does have a Core 2 Duo and it doesn't
have a schooler so we can utilize that
motherboard since it's a really good LGA
771 board and in the other PC we've got
a Core 2 quad a q9 450 I believe a
gigabytes of ddr2 memory so we could
take that from the Intel board since the
Intel board I believe doesn't overclock
and the vrm doesn't look that good
either
take those components put on the p5q
deluxe we've now got a solid entry level
gaming PC in my opinion we're going to
put that to the test later and then on
the other end of the spectrum with these
parts we've got left over we can try and
make something that'll just play for
night since I do have for one gigabyte
sticks of ddr2 do you have a gtx 750 a
real low end power supply and also a 160
gigabyte hard drive so we're gonna make
magic with that that'll be the third PC
and then also on the desk here we've got
a p7 p 55 d I love this motherboard it's
a real good solid mid-range p55 LGA 1156
motherboard so we're gonna be putting a
0 on X 30 440 in that as well as a
cooler from ID cooling this is an SE 207
and in Australia I don't know where else
they sell this cooler but they're
selling in Australia for 49 AUD twin
tower cooler 2 fans and I'm gonna see
how that performs so let's get on with
refurbishing these three potatoes
so this case here it's a little bit
special so I'm gonna sideline this for
another project in the future and get
back to working on these other two cases
and builds so we pulled this whole build
apart now and we've got this sis color
here it's just got metal shavings in it
which I've I don't think I've seen this
before the amount of metal shavings
coming off this thing is incredible so
we're gonna get the brush out just brush
it down give it a hammering and then
hopefully start putting this PC back
together and we would have had the first
potato completed
so just completed giving this
motherboard some tech yes lovin and it's
looking really good but before we put it
in the bill we just want to make sure
everything's running right and we can do
this with inside the boss itself and I'm
glad I did the CPU temperatures are
looking ok but this motherboard won't
work with a gigabytes of memory
installed you'll only work at the moment
with two gigabytes so just gonna quickly
update the boss and then hopefully
that'll fix the RAM compatibility issue
then we're going to drop it in the build
and finish it
the right here we've got a rusty front
panel still even off inconvenient good
wire brushing so we're gonna do the good
old trusty marker and just start
coloring it in so there are these guys
one potato is finished let's get on to
completing these others
so ii built is now complete we've got
this massive cooler on board at gtx 780
Ti and we're gonna start doing some
overclocking but while we're doing some
overclocking we're gonna build the third
PC now with a case that has been lying
around for months and months and the
last time I used this dell case things
were shorting out and they just weren't
working properly but since it's a real
budget build anyway we're gonna give it
a shot
so here's the last building this one is
the most potato out of all potatoes but
it just keeps boot cycling and the fan
will just instantly turn off I believe
it's the case I've even put rubber
grommets underneath four of the end
screws to lift it off but it still does
it so I'm gonna take it out of the case
and see if it boots then and if it does
in this case is just cursive and it must
not be used it's going in the bin
forever but if it does boot if it
doesn't boot again sorry then it might
be a faulty motherboard so let's find
out so I was up late last night and I
had some problems with this computer it
was so painstakingly hard to get this
thing to work so first of all these
memory sticks they only work in this
configuration to get four gigabytes if I
had it in the other way around it
wouldn't boot it give three beeps also
this case right here there's Dell that I
pulled out of the garage that was just
really dirty and stuff the power button
itself was causing this whole build to
short out so I had to rip the wire out
of one of these two then use the power
button on the front also the USB ports
were so rusted out that I had to just
pull them all out because if I plugged
him up to the motherboard it was short
out the computer but everything is
running now but there's just one more
problem with this PC and that is that
this harddrive here the 160 gigabyte
it's just so slow like it does nothing
here's here's it like I'll close this
browser down and I'll try and open it up
again and it just takes so long to do
anything it's really painful to the
point where I don't even know if this
single light load over watch because I
wanted to try and sell it as an
overwatch PC but I don't even think
it'll do that so I might just settle for
parts since it does have a gtx 750 in it
i'll see how it goes like i'll trying it
over what's working so not over watch I
mean fortnight or trainee a fortnight
working and that doesn't work then yeah
or just be a for sale for parts where I
might try and put a 1 terabyte in I
don't know
and finally here we are at the table
with these three pcs and this one has a
little bit of a story because I did end
up putting a 1 terabyte hard drive in
and it fixed that real sluggish slow
response so basically this hard drive
here is done it's gonna go in the bin
but the GTX 750 4 gigabytes of ddr2 and
this quad core here the 9400 and this
motherboard that I don't even want to
bother overclocking and this real
mediocre power play this managed to get
a fortnight at 1080p running at 80 to
100 fps and it was really smooth
providing was the only game open and
Windows has been optimized but that's a
good selling point because I'll now be
able to easily get around 200 Australian
dollars for this PC and it's just
awesome because you're making something
out of something that otherwise a lot of
people would just throw out or discard
or just say no it's completely useless
but you make these parts together and
makes energy and even though it took a
lot of troubleshooting especially with
the ddr2 and also a lot of
troubleshooting these power connectors
and getting this case working I kind of
really enjoyed this one the most out of
these three pcs I mean providing it did
work in the end sometimes it does get
very frustrating it doesn't work but
this one here right beside it this is
very interesting because this was that
new cooler from ID cooling now I did try
there water coolers in the past and
honestly they looked cool but they
weren't that good for performance this
air cooler looks like it's really good
for performance I did put the thermal
imaging camera on it it was staying very
cool it was actually pretty quiet as
well and on the xeon unfortunate could
only get up to three point eight
gigahertz because the motherboard sort
of topped out after that going to 200
base clock just really presented
problems that kept blue screen and kept
crashing tried changing the IMC voltage
drop to keep you I transport speed down
as well
tried all different voltages and even
dropping the memory down to twelve
hundred megahertz wouldn't make a
difference it just wouldn't go any
higher
so 3.0 gigahertz unfortunately is the
most with the Xeon X 3440 and that's why
I do like as I said in the past the x34
seventies you get that extra flexibility
regardless of your motherboard not being
able to go that high so gtx 780 Ti this
thing here is performing and actually
the best thing about this cooler is it's
in Australia I don't know where else
it's sold in the world in Australia it's
49 Australia
dollars from pili I believe in the moon
that's an absolute bargain for this
cooler but the case itself it looks so
clean as I said before really digging
this whole build considering it's kept
chipper mustard and it's sort of like
this nothing else to the case there's no
cable management options I think you
came out really clean let me know what
you think in the comments with this bill
of course I look forward to doing more
tests with the ex 34:30 versus the x34
40 as well possibly with this 780ti but
last up here we have the build this is
sort of like the spare parts that were
better than the other build we ended up
putting a 7870 on this bill because the
GTX 750 did not work and so now we got a
gigabytes of ddr2 and also we've got
this fifth caller so I will start
overclocking this and also put a 20
centimeter fan on as well as no fan
doing sort of like a cool comparison as
people on a budget who can't afford
fancy cases with three fans at the front
and mesh panels just to see how much
extra performance or extra cooling you
can get from a budget cooler and you
guys I hope you enjoyed this one
refurbishing potatoes you can really
make something out of nothing especially
if you've got the tools and the wd-40
and wire brushes and sort of just cloth
and a little bit of patience cotton buds
all that good stuff I even got a little
brush for some of the fins as well but
here they are they're all working and
they're all gonna be coming in separate
videos as well doing some cool little
tests with that so stay tuned for that
well at least these two builds anyway
and if you enjoy this video then be sure
to hit that like button and let me know
in the comment section below if you want
to see any more tests especially with
these three pcs and I'll be sure to make
it happen for you and I'll catch you
guys in another tech video very soon
peace out for now Bay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
