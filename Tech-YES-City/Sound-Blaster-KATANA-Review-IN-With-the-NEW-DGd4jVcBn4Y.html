exchange for the creative soundbar well
I got to be honest it didn't require a
whole lot of Korean school walking bag
attack City this is brand coming to you
guys said it was easily my favorite
product from creative today this is the
Blaster X katana which is a 2.1 sound
bar and sub speaker setup the features a
unique configuration with essentially a
5 speaker 3-way design with 2 15 watt
RMS 2.5 inch neodymium midbass drivers
and - 7.5 watt RMS rated aluminium don't
1.3 4 inch tweeters 1 inch for the left
and right for a total of 4 speakers on
the sound bar itself then you have 130
watt RMS 6 inch subwoofer to give you a
true 3-way stereo sound with the 4
mention unit separately dedicated to
bass mids and treble respectively TV
blends of the construction of this unit
has a metal finish on the top rear front
sides with the front sides being meshed
in the middle of the unit there is the
sound blaster ex branding with the power
and Bluetooth button press this to turn
the unit on and voila hold it down and
you can pair with your smartphone then
there is the volume which you can
control via the unit itself or Windows
or even on a keyboard with a volume
control knob and the good thing here is
that it is all intertwined into one
controller so you won't have to worry
about changing 5 different volumes to
get the right level of volume for input
and output the unit has a micro USB in
USB flash port drive optical in aqsa
Larian headphone out and also mic in now
the unit itself does have an inbuilt 96
kilohertz 24 bit DAC 24-bit 48 kilohertz
ADC and a 75 watt RMS amp all built into
the sound bar itself so you can use a
different sub or not even use the sub at
all if you wish to then moving on to the
last part of the unit it has seven
segments of 49 individually controllable
RGB LEDs with present patterns that you
can change from the unit self without
having to install any software at all
though for customizing not just the RGB
LEDs but also the sound then I highly
recommend installing the sound blaster
connect software suite which comes
included with the
and here you can change the colors flow
and styles of your RGB LEDs for your
desired look you can also save them to
separate profiles me I have two profiles
one for editing which is a flat neutral
profile no gimmicks here just flatten
boring this is for when I'm editing
content need a balanced sound but for
gaming and listening to music then I
jump on the EQ and pump up the bass and
treble now depending on the game I can
also use the immersion setting now there
are other settings here that can do
stuff for different people with
different needs for instance the dialog
+ can bring out the voices over other
volumes which is great for nighttime
listening smart volume is essentially a
nominal Iser
great if you are wearing headphones then
the setting beside that is the
crystallizer which can bring out more
detail and music though the side effect
is that it can also make your music
sound very edgy or too crisp then the
last setting besides that is the
immersion setting or software surround
which can essentially emulate 7.1
surround sound even though it doesn't
work like the legit thing it can still
help when you're hearing things like
footsteps and games like counter-strike
csgo for example though after you've
found your favorite profiles you can
then save them in the Sound Blaster
Kinect dashboard and bring out not only
the best audio but the best bling-bling
for your setup also in the software you
can save and share your profiles and
copy other people's profiles for new
ideas that is if you are running out of
new ideas what about the quality of the
audio coming out of the katana well I
absolutely loved it and as I said in the
intro it is hands-down the best creative
product I have tried to date the audio
can go really damn loud and even at max
volume I heard no Distortion but let's
take a quick listen
you
you
in my opinion I think it is good enough
for a whole room and still have some
volume to go though for house parties
you'd probably want something with a bit
more power though we'll do gatherings
pretty easy as well and what about that
mic input well it just wouldn't be a
taxi D review without me testing that
mic import so let's take a listen this
is what a v-moda boom pro will sound
like through the Sound Blaster katana on
the out-of-the-box settings now let's
quickly try and turn off a noise
suppression or noise removal so this is
the second test with noise reduction
turned off so I thought the noise
reduction was pretty good even though it
altered my voice a little bit I thought
it was still consistent reduction so my
voice still sounded really good with
little noise and also there is a voice
changer to there where you can alter
your voice to sound really crazy or even
really freaky here's a little example if
you want to sound like a robot then you
can you can also sound emo you can
format a chipmunk or you can sound like
an elf so there it is guys the katana
all in a one phenomenal unit there
really is perfect for my needs and
couldn't come at a better time replacing
my old 2.1 sound system that was cutting
out all the time though honestly there
really isn't anything I can take here
except the price it is quite expensive
however it is one product that is sure
to make you happy and will blend in
pretty much with any setup that even has
a shred of black in it anyway guys I
hope you enjoyed this review of the
Sound Blaster X and if you did then
don't forget to Hulk smash that like
button and let me know in the comments
section below
what sounds setup are you running at the
moment and if you are in need of a new
sound upgrade would you want a creative
katana
bowls 2.1 sound bar setup let me know
we'd love to hear your thoughts and
opinions as always and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
