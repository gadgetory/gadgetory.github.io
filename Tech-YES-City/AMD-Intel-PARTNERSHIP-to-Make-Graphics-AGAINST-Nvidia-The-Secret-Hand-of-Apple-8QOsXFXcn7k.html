crazy all sorts of good and now things
are getting even more crazier with the
recent announcement of a partnership
between Intel and AMD that's right the
same company to quote bas Rutten that
AMD into the ground is now the same
company that's gonna be utilizing their
technology and this is one thing that
really confuses me about the corporate
world I guess I just don't understand it
at all wait actually do think I
understand it in this case Intel's the
pimp and AMD's the hook though all jokes
aside what does this spell for the tech
industry and also for us as tech
enthusiasts let's discuss welcome back
to tech yes City and today I'm gonna
take a look at not only AMD Intel and
NVIDIA in this big deal but also which I
believe is the biggest player and that
is Apple if you guys didn't know Apple
is currently three times the size of AMD
Intel and NVIDIA put together they are a
massive company with a massive amount of
pulling power and since they use Intel
CPUs and AMD GPUs pretty much
exclusively in their Macintosh lineup it
makes no surprise that Intel are
releasing a chip that's going to use
less power be more efficient and have
really good graphics processing power
with an AMD chip on board in their new
design now they're utilizing AMD
semi-custom design and also not only
that they're pulling over Raja Kaduri
which is AMD's chief architect for the
AMD graphics division who's recently
left and joining Intel but when it
really boils down to it yes Intel's
gonna win big out of this partnership
but also Apple I believe is going to be
the biggest winner not only can they
sell more products now that a thinner
more powerful but they'll also be
utilizing more of that profit because of
the reduced costs of going with that CPU
mix with the GPU into a new custom chip
design and not only is Intel pulling
over some talent from AMD with Roger
Kaduri they're also pulling over some
talent from Apple as well which sort of
further adds to the fuel that Apple has
a bigger hand than people may believe in
this deal between AMD and
Intel so this is the first announcement
from Intel on this piece of technology
will be going into laptops Intel have
also gone on the record for stating that
they want to compete in the high-end
discrete graphics card market so are
they going to be making a discrete GPU
that remains to be seen but people are
saying that this is the fall or the
start of the fall of Nvidia and I'm here
to sort of disagree with that Nvidia in
the last five years have grown 20 fold
they're an absolute Dominator in terms
of the discrete graphics card market
quickly pulling up a steam survey shows
that 90% of GPUs used on Steam for
gaming are Nvidia graphics solutions and
furthermore with that laptops aren't
even in the top 10 of those GPUs so if
laptops are going to come in and compete
with the desktop gaming market I just
don't see how they're gonna
revolutionize and take over that desktop
market when there's such a big market
share and a lot of people myself
included love gaming at a desk with a
nice big keyboard mouse pad and mouse I
just don't see how a laptop is gonna
compete with this any time soon however
like I said before I believe Apple will
be the biggest winner here with brand
new products that look good they perform
better and they're more efficient so now
back to this focus between Nvidia versus
AMD and Intel Intel have grown only
twofold in the last five years which is
still massive and AMD have grown
fivefold pretty much restoring their
former glory
before they release the bulldozer
architecture however in video though
with that 20 fold growth are growing
rapidly and with that they are putting a
lot of money into R&amp;amp;D
volter is already out in the business
sector and they do have this technology
ready for the consumer sector in my
opinion this is a very efficient
architecture AMD don't have a solution
yet - volta and with that the graphics
card industry and the tech industry in
general is built up on efficiency those
who have the most powerful and most
efficient products are generally going
to lead the field
just a quick FYI for you guys all the
PCs that I've sold in the last year
practically everyone has bought those
pcs has asked me does this computer have
an Nvidia graphics card so not only is
nvidia killing it at the moment they've
also established a very strong brand
reputation in my opinion so with that in
mind i believe is going to be very hard
framed in in
tell to completely kill off in video
they ain't going anywhere anytime soon
in my opinion and since gravis cards or
at least GPU compute power is much
better a much more efficient than CPU
compute power I see the future being in
the graphics field maybe Intel feels a
little bit threatened by this and we've
also seen in video on the lines
releasing their own custom Tegra designs
which they may put further R&amp;amp;D into and
that's already going into the Nintendo
switches for examples so with all that
he's saying she say out there at the
moment I think the next few years are
going to be very interesting for the
tech scene and I do see Intel being very
threatened by Nvidia especially the
progress that they've made over the last
five years so what these new custom
designs from Intel are going to bring to
the market remains to be seen but one
thing's for sure is that Intel do have a
massive R&amp;amp;D budget and if they can pull
this into a GPU solution then it could
mean happy days for us as graphics card
consumers so the last thing I wanted to
talk about is the winners and losers in
this deal I think Nvidia are remaining
neutral at the moment especially since
Intel have drawn all their cards on the
table I think that Intel are definitely
gonna be a winner in this deal I think
Apple's gonna be the biggest winner
however AMD people are saying that AMD
is gonna be a winner out of this deal
and I kind of disagree I think AMD
acquired HDI back in 2006 and one of the
biggest goals was to make the APU their
own brand they have the AMD APU solution
that would sort of go into laptops and
be the most efficient processor out
there that could do graphics and CPU
compute however when Intel is coming
along now eleven years later it just
feels like they've taken all AMD's hard
work and now they're pretty much gonna
reap all the rewards out of AMD's hard
work so it's kind of disappointing to
see that AMD is just licensing this and
we know with the console deals that AMD
in my opinion did sell themselves cheap
to the console developers Sony and
Microsoft and also on that note the
Chinese government has also leased the
intellectual property off AMD as well so
one thing that AMD does have to be
careful with is if they list their IP
technology out too much then maybe these
other companies and especially in the
cases of the tech companies they can
figure out workarounds and then make a
clone or a copy of that architecture in
a
in years time once the licensing
agreements finished these companies
after they've made their own
architecture a spinoff and it happens
all the time and intellectual property
believe it or not they then AMD will
then get no rewards for their hard work
so no guys this was a topic that I
really want to discuss I think there's
much more than meets the eye especially
when you read the news articles and
what's going on there's a lot of
shifting going on between the scenes but
one thing I know certain is the next few
years are going to be very interesting
what's going to happen is anybody's
guess in my opinion market shift all the
time I mean five years ago or six years
ago when Fermi was released from Nvidia
who would have thought that Nvidia to
this date would be as big as they were
with the market share that they have now
so very interesting times ahead I think
it's gonna be interesting to see how the
market shifts are Nvidia going to lose
market share until gonna come into the
graphics card market as well and is
Apple going to keep growing and growing
and is AMD possibly gonna lose out of
this
so also went to Twitter to ask you guys
if you had any questions relating to
this matter and first of all hardware
unboxed he asked are they trading well
AMD's next-gen AP use have rising cores
and Intel HD graphics nice troll Steve I
don't think that will happen until HD
graphics are actually very underpowered
and they're pretty bad especially
compared to what Nvidia and AMD are
offering still win us is this to compete
in the high-end gaming laptop arena will
there be a desktop spin-off CPU and the
answer to this is definitely yes it is
competing in the high-end gaming laptop
arena I think will there be a desktop
spin-off CPU I believe so I mean if
Intel's making going out of their way to
make all this technology then I'm
certain they're gonna try and reap the
most that they can out of this however
also on that note with the high-end
laptop gaming Nvidia currently has the
max queue designs and they've got the
1080 s in there so until have to make
something that's very powerful from the
rumors that we're seeing so far with the
leaks they've got something that
competes with an rx 580 level so they
will have to up the game to get
something that can compete on the
highest end because just as important as
the mid-range and the upper mid-range
cards are even the low-end cards like
the GTX 1030 and 1050 the high-end is
really important for the
bragging rights for that company as well
rashon pesos or ask year will that make
the price of the processor become lower
if you're talking about just a cpu
definitely not but if you're talking
about a solution between a CPU and a GPU
if you were to go and buy those two
separate solutions versus this one a
sort of CPU hybrid then definitely yes
it should make the price law then be
asked is Intel doing this because AMD
Rison actually destroyed part of their
market no Intel I believe is doing this
because Apple want this that's my
opinion on that quickly got a message
whilst reading that comment donek Sam
asks I've been wondering is it possible
for the GPU implemented like this to be
as powerful as discrete GPUs and yes
definitely with the mid-range cards I
think that's possible we've seen with
the custom console solutions that they
can get a lot of power out of those so
it's gonna be interesting to see what
Intel brings to the market but in terms
of the highest-end like a GTX 10 ATT I
don't expect that anytime soon nascent
paid gaming says what are you filming
you don't want it to be out of focus
he's referring to some of my videos in
the past that have been out of focus I'm
a one-man band come on
Zubov Janek sorry if I pronounced that
wrong was Roger fired or not the people
want you to get to the bottom of this
that right there is a very difficult
question me being all the way over in
astray I would have no idea I can do a
bit of research I'll keep you guys
posted but ultimately only Roger and
their respective people who's signed
contracts with would know the real
answer or maybe if you let word slip
through a few close friends and I'm sure
they probably wouldn't talk either and
then the last question we have here is
from Adrian Smith what does this mean
for the future of budget laptops it
means a lot of good I think if they can
implement it at a really good price
point I think we could have a really
good experience not just on laptops but
also for instance my 4k editing PC that
I built recently something like that in
a very small case the potential of this
is actually really good if they can sort
of grab that APU design and give out a
lot more power that the APU used
previously couldn't hey guys if you
enjoyed today's video to be sure to hit
that like button and let me know in the
comments section below what you think
about this whole AMD and Intel
joining forces I'm pretty shocked to say
the least I didn't expect this one
coming in a million years and also on
that note if you guys want to go full
conspiracy in the comments section below
then go ahead I love reading those
comments and always love myself a good
conspiracy theory as well and also if
you want to join in on further
discussions while they're happening they
don't forget to follow us on Twitter and
I've also got an Instagram and Facebook
account as well and I'll catch you guys
in another tech video very soon peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
