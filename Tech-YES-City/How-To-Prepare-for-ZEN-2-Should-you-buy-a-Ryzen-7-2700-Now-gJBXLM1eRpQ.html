the prowl for a good deal and lately
I've been getting asked a few questions
about the risin 7 2,700 now currently
you can get this cpu for 210 US dollars
and at that price it's really good value
for 8 cause 16 threads that so if AK
lockable comes with an included cooler
but right around the corner in a week's
time
Zhen 2 is going to be released and
although the value for money on this
Rison 720 700 is pretty much going to be
unmatched in the new CPU scene it still
leaves the question of should you wait a
week's time even if you want to purchase
something like the rising 720 700 or
should you just buy it now and skip the
wait because prices of this stuff might
go up after the Zen to launch well today
I'm going to give you guys some
suggestions because ultimately you can
do what you want with your money but I'm
definitely going to give you guys my
advice as a deal hunter so you can save
the most money going into the Zen to
launch
so the two CPUs right now that are
looking really good on the new market is
the Rison 526 hundred one hundred and
fifty dollars and also the horizon 727
hundred at two hundred and ten USD now
here's where things get a little bit
tricky because if you're building a
whole new entire system and the whole
build for instance is going to tally a
thousand dollars then paying an extra
hundred dollars or so for that risin
seven thirty seven hundred X when it's
released I would say would be worth the
wait especially if it's going to deliver
what AMD has promised that it's going to
deliver as CES and also Computex
but on that note there's some other
things that we're going to look at
because the smartest play in my opinion
would be to look back at launches like
Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge and when
those CPUs launched everyone was buying
motherboards are buying SSDs they're
buying cases power supplies RAM and all
the prices of these things went up after
these CPUs and motherboards were
launched but if we learn anything from
that it's that is if you know you're
going to be building an entirely new
system then the best way to be would be
to get all the extra pieces except the
CPU and the motherboard or in this case
I'd actually recommend getting a
motherboard like this one right here the
B 450 tomahawk which has USB flash back
and it will support the latest 3rd gen
riser chips
so if you get a motherboard like this
you get some ddr4 memory for instance
you can get 32 hundred megahertz seal 16
480 dollars for a 16 gigabyte kit I
haven't seen prices this cheap on memory
in a long time and then you've got
things like power supplies cases SSDs
all this stuff is currently going for
pretty much under retail at really good
prices right before launch so if you
guys definitely know that you're going
to be building a new gaming PC for
either yourself or a friend it would
definitely be a wise decision in my
opinion to get all the stuff except the
CPU except the graphics card right here
today so you can save yourself even
possibly $100 on a brand new build
now of course buying a be 450
motherboard you're not going to be
getting support for the latest PCI
generation 4 but as I said in my
previous anti-lag video that I did when
I was over in the USA is one of those
things that I can't see a whole
a lot of people adopting and kneading
and especially if you're a gamer I don't
see any gamer that's going to be able to
utilize PCIe Gen 4 and get any benefit
first say PCI gen3 the biggest benefit I
saw out a PCIe gen 4 was some of those
new nvme SSDs and also 8k video editors
and of course when it comes to those
brand new x5 70 motherboards they're
gonna cost a lot more than a be 450 so
lastly about the CPUs right if you buy
the 2700 today even though you're
getting a good deal you may get buyer's
remorse
if those new rise and third gym chips
are launched and they're as good as AMD
says they are I can only imagine
building a PC myself and then being like
oh I wish I had waited a week so I could
get on that new latest and greatest
because it is looking like it's going to
be a great release 15% IPC increase and
also dropping down to 7 nanometer which
brings its own benefits as well named
idli lower power consumption especially
clock for clock but some other things to
talk about in relation to Zen 2 is we
can also see that the memory speeds are
now supported at higher megahertz 32
hundred megahertz official means that
you'll definitely be able to get a kit
like the one we looked at today and
you'll have no problems running it with
the new Rison 3000 series chips
so my advice going into the video so far
is definitely hold out on the CPU but
now what about a graphics card in my
recent past hunt video I did yesterday
I'll put the link up here for you guys I
was saying that the use market is
definitely starting to dry up in terms
of good deals so this means that the
power is going to swing back to the new
market and the GPUs however we are
literally right around the corner from
getting to new launches from both AMD
and NVIDIA with the super and also the
5700 XT and Nan xt series this means
that we're going to hopefully see the
prices of current new GPUs on the market
come down in price so everything is
pointing towards just waiting this extra
week to see how prices of new pots shift
and fluctuate and my guess is even that
rise in seven twenty seven hundred after
the launch of Xen 2 may even come down a
little bit more however on the flip side
of things everything else that we've
talked about today things like power
supplies cases deed
yeah for memory motherboards they're all
going to go up in price once the new Zen
- and also these new graphics cards are
launched so basically guys if you want
to get the best deals on building a new
system around Zen - my advice would be
to buy everything right now and bought
the CPU but the GPU and then you'll have
happy days ahead and also on that note
be careful if you're going to buy an
older motherboard like X 470 and X 370
or be 350 be 450 make sure it has USB
flash back or of course if you've got an
older CPU like a risin three 1200 you
can use that and then update your BIOS
once these new CPUs are out and of
course extract a lot of value out of
some of the already really good prices
that you're going to see on some of
these motherboards from the previous
generations and without aside guys I
hope you enjoyed this video if you did
then be sure to hit that like button for
us also let us know in the comment
section below what you think about my
advice here today do you have a
different strategy going into Zen to
love reading your thoughts and opinions
as always and with that said I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon but
if you're enjoying this one then be sure
to hit that sub button ring the bell on
the way out and I'll catch you next time
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
