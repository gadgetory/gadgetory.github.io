I'm gonna be revealing this SSD it's a
hundred and twenty eight gigabyte SSD
from a dotter now the reason why I got
this SSD was because it was the cheapest
128 gigabyte SSD currently in Japan I
got this for about $90 every other SSD
was about $900 so it was $10 cheaper and
its side of three as well so I'm also
gonna be doing a quick unboxing for you
guys showing you what you get in the box
and also that I'm gonna be benchmarking
this with a SSS D and I'll give you guys
a conclusion and recommendation on this
SSD so this is the box this is how it
comes packaged it comes with a three
year warranty now the reason why I got
this SSD was because that it was only
$90 and that's pretty cheap for 128
gigabytes
now I recently saw my Corsair hard drive
because I didn't have a need for it
however since I've got this AMD rig that
I'm building at the moment I figured
well I'm gonna need an SSD again so I
picked up this one and basically gonna
say first thing before we unbox it is I
don't like the way it's packaged I mean
you've got the SSD pretty much hitting
the box so this thing could easily get
damaged in shipping that's one thing I
sort of am noticing straight away as we
get before we get into the unboxing here
so so taking off the seal we can then
start to unpackage the contents and yeah
I mean there it is just a simple SSD
comes in the Box from a data it's got a
QuickStart guide there so if you want to
install the SSD quickly and then you're
gonna need that QuickStart guide but
here's the actual SSD itself that's
probably what you're most interested in
how does it feel it actually feels
really good I like the feel of this SSD
it's lightweight but at the same time if
they're using aluminium I think it is
and it feels really good so the quality
of this SSD actually feels pretty decent
like it feels like a nice SSD and it
actually looks really nice as well so
yeah that's the speeds now I think the
read speed sequential read speeds are
counted to be four up to five hundred
fifty megabytes per second and central
writes are up to 550 anyway I'll be
doing some tests quickly and showing you
guys how this SSD performs let's also
look what else we get in the box here we
get a a bracket I believe this looks
like a
racket with some double-sided tape to
hold it in place for maybe a laptop I
guess not so sure but it comes with this
standard screws ah
that's sorry that's for the tray so that
would be it for the tray so you can
install it into a 3.5 inch drive base so
for ninety dollars you get 128 gigabytes
of SSD you get a bracket and you get a
manual so not bad value I'm going to
test I mean this is retail as well this
is $90 retail I didn't get this on sale
but I had the need for it so it's there
it's pretty cheap I don't I mean I could
probably get an SSD for $80 but I don't
really see myself finding one that cheap
but yeah anyway that's that guys let's
move on now to the performance of this
thing I'll be testing it against my
Intel 256 gigabyte and seeing how well
it performs okay so moving on now to the
SSD benchmarks I pretty much only use
one program and that is a SSD as it's so
lightweight and it's so easy and it
presents the results in an easy-to-read
format and it allows that that
ultimately allows me to communicate the
results to you guys with relative ease
so I really love this SSD benchmarking
utility and I can highly recommend it
looking on the left here we have the
Intel which is a 240 weight model I
managed to pick this up at a steal last
year I think it was like 100 and I
forgot 165 dollars that I'd have to jog
my memory but as you guys know Intel
SSDs are really solid especially for the
money they're just solid performers
they're not the best performers out
there but at the same time they're
definitely not the worst and the
reliability of Intel SS these are
actually pretty damn impressive
this one hasn't missed the beat neither
did my force 3 either my Corsair force
three that didn't miss a beat either
although it didn't score as high as the
SSD in the benchmark but let's look on
the right here the SP 900 that I mean
the Intel scored 780 but the SP 900
scored an overall score of 475 which was
it's good it's it's pretty impressive
for a entry level 120 gigabyte SSD or
128 gigabyte SSD
I thought the 4k read and write speed
were very good for an entry-level SSD I
mean this is what makes in my opinion an
SSD feel so much faster than a hard disk
drive it's it's because of these 4k
reading rights and the 4k reading rights
on the SSD the SP 900 were decent these
sequential reads were pretty good as
well so you're gonna be loading up gains
pretty quick you're gonna be loading up
all those far I have big files pretty
quickly the sequential writes weren't
that impressive I mean if you're doing
real heavy workloads then I probably
don't recommend this SSD but at the same
time if you've got a real heavy
workstation you're probably going to
have a pretty pro set up you know you
probably have some Samsung 840 pros in
there or whatnot so leave for you know
4k 64 threaded spit a read and write
tests weren't that bad it really in and
the access to read and write times
weren't that bad either so overall I
mean it scored about a hundred points
higher than my course Air Force 3 and my
course f4 3 was $100 I mean sorry about
$30 more expensive so ultimately this is
it's it's a good score I mean it's a
solid score for an SSD so now let's move
on now to the conclusion so in
conclusion this a data SSD is a decent
biome and it's good value for money it's
the cheapest SSD I could find and it
performed reasonably well in the a s SSD
benchmark I mean it's no samsung pro but
it's definitely a solid entry-level SSD
I mean you're gonna notice a difference
if you're going to one of these from a
hard drive then you're certainly going
to notice a difference in everyday usage
speeds I mean the 4k reading rights were
decent the a s SSD scores were decent I
mean schedule reads were decent so I
imagine this thing being a decent
recommended by for anyone or any gamer
looking for a a solid SSD with a solid
warranty I'm in three years is pretty
good and it also I mean it also looks
pretty good I mean I actually this is
one of my favorite looking SSDs I mean I
might take this sticker off as well and
it would just look just polished clean
black so that's actually a really cool
thing about this SSD if you take this a
data sticker off so
anyway make sure you don't remove this
rear sticker here like if you remove the
rear sticker then you may have some
problems with warranty so ultimately
it's a good product it's not the best
it's not the worst and I mean it perform
better than my old Corsair for three and
I paid more for that courselet course
Air Force three so yeah I can recommend
this product if you have any questions
about the a data SSD then please leave a
comment in the comment section below and
if you like this video please give it a
thumbs up and I'll be coming back to you
guys soon with some more tech videos and
lastly another good point is that yeah
you actually get a hundred and nineteen
point seven one real gigabytes of space
so it's actually a good feature as well
about this SSD so yeah decent SSD for
the money
can recommend it peace out for now BAE</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
