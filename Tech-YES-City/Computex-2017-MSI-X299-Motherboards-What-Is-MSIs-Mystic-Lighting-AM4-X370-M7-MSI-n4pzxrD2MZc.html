brought to you by MSI and Corsair
bringing you the best in PC peripherals
and components click the link in the
description below to find out more about
current specials being offered by both
MSI and Corsair over the Computex period
so coming in with the X 370 lineup they
have a new motherboard hitting the
shelves this is the gaming m7 this is
one coming you out of Computex and
especially what you get from this
motherboard is extra features and
functions over there very popular I
think it's the best-selling motherboard
from MSI at the moment the X 370 gaming
Pro carbon a/c did you believe you get a
USB 3.1 type-c included you also get
these BIOS read out better audio the
including their audio booth 4.0 which is
an upgrade as well and then you get more
options for SATA turbo u dot 2 and of
course slightly better overclocking on
this motherboard and have upgraded
cosmetic with the RGB lighting and
support for mystic lighting also on
display at the msi booth was there
mystic lighting demo now mystic lighting
is pretty much being introduced to all
msi boards
and essentially what it is is powered by
the SteelSeries engine so in this case
you can have games like dota 2 and csgo
and also minecraft which of the three
games that are currently supported you
can then hook them up to RGB lighting
from different manufacturers different
companies and then you can have that
being controlled and linked to different
effects in the game for example in dota
2 you can have it so the lights change
color and even flash when you're low on
health so you've got full health your
health bar and the lighting will be
green and then if your health drops you
will start flashing red and this can be
done in csgo as well but it can also be
linked to things like cooldown so if
you've got a full cooldown the lights
will again remain green but if the
cooldowns been used and it takes a long
time to
down then the lights can change to red
so this will have a very good
application in a number of games if game
support gets added in I could especially
see this being useful in games like
World of Warcraft as well on display at
the MFA booth they had five new X 299
boards available the first one coming in
is the SL Live Plus this is that budget
price performance entry option if you're
looking to overclock especially on air
water and not be put out of too much
money also they have to m dot 2 slots
really good onboard audio within the
handed 4 solution and support for RGB
mystic lighting and then above that they
have the x2 99 tomahawk which is
actually going away with the RGB
lighting so it's going for that
camouflaged look and when I asked MSA
why this was is because the game is
looking for camouflage a lot of the time
don't want any lighting on board so they
can go where the RGB lighting go away
with all that and then put it into the
camouflage cosmetic look and then pass
those savings on to the customer so they
will be having their camo in the x2 99
variant straight away from the get-go
and then to the bottom out of the booth
they have the gaming Perot carbon a/c on
the X 299 line up this board offers
better cosmetics with the option to
change from carbon black to gold or
silver on the accent and as well as
having full RGB across the board and
better overclock ability this is only
they pride the gaming Pro carbon on now
they did manage to reach apparently 5
gigahertz on ddr4 memory on air this is
extremely huge overclock on their ddr4
memory and this board can definitely do
that and then above that they also have
the gaming m7 and now the great thing
about the m7 is the features included
Wi-Fi from killer so if you're on a
congested network or if you just want
better internet or Wi-Fi built in then
the m7 will be for you but it also
features an 8 plus 4 and
power connecter so it is better for
overclocking especially if you're going
to be getting one of those 18 cores and
then the last board they had on display
for the X to 99th series was their
expound gaming ACC we're talking the
best overclocking board from MSI so for
extreme overclockers and it also bridges
tantalum capacitors and that's all I
could really see there you've got the AC
Wireless support and a very different
look going on with this board very
space-age and if you're into that thing
and this thing will certainly give you
the power and then some from the
space-age to give you the best
overclocks
another motherboard they have on display
with the a m4 lineup which I thought was
really cool was the be 350 tomahawk
Arctic Edition this was a all-white
camo'd motherboard and they even put it
in display on a PC that was there and I
must say I was impressed when looking at
the MSI motherboard you may notice been
um dot to shield so MSI Italian this is
version 2 and I did ask them straight
away what about the cooling performance
since the generation 1 was a very
controversial thing and they insure me
that since they are now using aluminium
they will get lower temperatures
although one thing is certain it does
add to the ascetics of the motherboards
so if you guys are into the Z 270 lineup
they have a new motherboard hitting that
lineup this is the godlike gaming
essentially with more phases then the
power gaming titanium you've also got
the support for the killer Nick there
with killer Wi-Fi to something they
pride themselves on and of course you
can even change the RGB lighting on the
fly which is something that is an extra
upgrade for cosmetics if you wanted
another component coming with the x2 99
motherboards are ek water blocks so they
have teamed up with ek to make a custom
water block solution for the CPU socket
now this will be available on the X
$2.99 gaming 4 and also the gaming m7
and on that note they do have the
Seahawk 1080 and 1080 T is hitting the
market which will also have custom water
blocks so now with MSI's components you
can do a full custom loop and that
roughs up the coverage of MSI's
motherboards and components coming in
2017 and I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and if you did the be sure to hit
that like button I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon these are
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
