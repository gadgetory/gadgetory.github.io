the deep cool booth and right beside me
is a 40 USD case that's right $40 for
this with tempered glass and the
aesthetics this thing is going to be
hitting hard coming out in September
2018 initially in the US after that they
do plan to release it in Europe and also
Australia as well with pricing to be
updated to now the thing is you're
getting a cheap case but it's not just
cheap it's really bringing some hard
value got steel included on the inserts
and also inside you can fill up to a 2
10 mil long tower cooler on the CPU or
at the front of the case you can fit a
360 mil rad with 3 120mm fans or even 3
140 mm fans as well at the front of the
case now also at the top you can fit a
280 Mildred so core says 280 mils for
example will fit 2 and on the rear you
can fit a 120mm fan so this thing I
really shocked when this hits the market
I believe this will be what the bargain
hunters for instance use PC parts
hustlers as well will be loving this
thing just because you can go get a 3/8
3-pack of RGB LED fans off Aliexpress
for example and you'll have just really
good aesthetic on a budget now another
thing about this case as well you can
fit extended ATX motherboards in here
too so if you've got server motherboards
if you're putting together a real cheap
PC this will allow that so deep cool
have really gone to the basics with
researching aesthetics and what people
want so I'm really looking forward to
this case but they've also go to another
two cases on display so let's go check
them out
mm 18s Computex coverage wouldn't be
possible without gigabyte or Corsair
bringing you the quality and also the
reliability that you need when building
a new PC welcome to the new world
welcome to the new world guys and here
we have the matrix 70 this is coming in
20 USD more than the matrix 55 now it's
got the same support in terms of fans
and also coolers you get three SSDs and
two 3.5 inch mechanicals just like the
matrix 55 except this has addressable
RGB so if you want to customise the
build and not have to rely on any
external controllers you pretty much get
that controller at this build for $20
more than the matrix 55 also this case
will support up to a three hundred and
80 ml graphics card The Matrix 55 370
but they do have one more option after
this as well if you want to step up your
game and you want to pay a little bit
more for a case let's go check that out
and then last up on the line we have the
matrix 75 of the all options all
expenses included this is the granddaddy
of the three here with the ability to
change the front panel so if you want to
go from the mesh to solid they get the
aesthetic you can do that or if you want
to go back to mesh you can do that with
this case so people who are fanboys of
getting that airflow through or they
think stuff's going to blow up if they
don't have the airflow they can change
it with the matrix 75 now it's coming in
at 90 USD and it's also got a little bit
more options than the previous as well
supports ehx latches with the side panel
so that can come down you can take that
off with ease and then you get one extra
SSD based support and for cooling
support you have the ability to support
a 220 ml tall CPU cooler and a 390
milling graphics card now magnetic dust
filters throughout this whole case the
matrix 70 you get some magnetic dust
filters however on the top of this case
you can pull off the panel as well it is
sort of like a modular design and then
you can have that option to let air flow
out the top put a dust filter on that or
close it off if you don't need that open
at all so that's the option you get with
the matrix 75 matrix 70 you do get some
dust filters included and then of course
the bargain matrix 55 is just coming in
a pure price performance value
and that about wraps things up for deep
cool in 2018 at Computex i hope you guys
enjoyed the coverage especially those
three cases I can't wait for them to be
released and just beside me as well
they're updating the look on their gamax
GT cooler this is the air cooler going
with that whole tough series theme
they're also releasing a power supply as
well to match sort of that gold and
black look that a Zeus have been pushing
hard from 2018 with their tough gaming
series so if that's what you want to go
with deep cool are offering those
options too anyway guys hope you enjoyed
