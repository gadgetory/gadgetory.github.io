first time Intel's released a 6-quart 12
threaded CPU as an entry-level CPU in
their enthusiast platform coming into
$400 this may certainly seem like
compelling value for money or is it
let's find out today
so with practically every other reviewer
out there reviewing the 59 60 X that's
the eighth course 16 threaded Beast I
took it upon myself to get the value
option the $400 5820k now this is a six
core 12 threaded CPU that comes clocked
in at three point three gigs base with a
three point six gig turbo clock the case
ratio also comes in clocked at three
gigahertz which I'll talk a little bit
more about that in the conclusion
overclocking however the only
disadvantage of the CPU really is that
it has 28 PCIe lanes first it's bigger
brother the 59 30k which has 40 PCIe
lanes however you do pay on average a
$200 premium for those extra lanes and
on a good note it does have an extra 12
lanes over the little brother of the
four 790 K so this does have a place in
the market however another disadvantage
of this is that you will have to get the
pricey x99 platform as well as the
currently newly released ddr4 memory
which also will set you back quite a bit
of money so those two things a slide is
this CPU good value for money let's move
on now to the benchmarks well be
benchmarking this in games productivity
benchmarks will be testing power
consumption and then we'll move on to a
conclusion where I talk about
overclocking as well so let's move on
now to the benchmarks where I've tested
gaming boot times productivity power
consumption so there's so much juicy
stuff here and this CPU was clocked at
four point two gigs that's of 5820k and
I compared it against the four 670 K
which was clocked at four point six gigs
now the reason I did this is because I
believe that's about the fair difference
between them I do believe on average a
four core will go higher than a six or
an eight core and it was reflected in
the voltages ultimately this was at one
point two four volt and my for 670 K was
at one point two five five volts are
very similar the RAM speeds I'll put
that in the description below but the
four 670 K was clocked at two gigs the
memory and the 5820k I decided to leave
that on the default of two one three
three as I'll be doing a review on the
ddr4 memory for crucial very soon but
let's move on now to the gaming
benchmarks battlefield for 1080p ultra
the test range this manage this was
actually an interesting benchmark we
managed to see the 5820k pull of victory
a clear victory here with one hundred
eighty seven point nine two frames per
second average
versus the four 670 K average frames per
second of 160 8.08 I also tested this on
Windows 8 as well both CPUs as opposed
to Windows 7 which I've done a lot of my
previous testing on and the reason was I
had the VI had really said that the
5820k kind of clumped out but let's move
on now to Crysis 3 1080p ultra and this
was done with 59.2 8 frames per second
versus 58.92 so in Crysis 3 on the 5820k
versus the 4 670 K there was virtually
no difference at all so if you were
buying this 5820k for extra Crysis 3
speeds you'd be in bad luck but now
let's move on now the Skyrim one game
that I was actually very curious to see
the results for because this is a game
that relies on not just ram speeds it
relies on CPU cache and CPU clock speeds
it's very intense on all those three
things and this just showed it I mean
this CPU was clocked 400 megahertz lower
and it scored 170 5.08 French for a
second versus a hundred and sixty eight
point five two on the four 670 K so it's
clocked law but it's scoring a higher
scoring highest score and I think this
mainly has to do with the extra CPU
cache it has a lot more CPU cache on
board than the four 670 K so that just
proved that this is really good I really
enjoyed doing that benchmark moving on
now to ARMA 3 1080p ultra this benchmark
was interesting because the for 670 K
scored a clear victory here being
seventy-three point five six frames per
second average frames per second on the
5820k versus seventy-eight point eight
four frames per second on the for 670 K
so Wow the I mean the 5820k lost here so
ARMA 3 is clearly clock speed dependent
on fewer cores so it's not optimized for
those multi-threaded CPUs well it is I
guess for core optimize for four cores
but anyway let's move on out some 1440p
benchmarks battlefield for a hundred and
twenty four frames per second on the
5820k versus the four 670 K which scored
a hundred and ten so there was another
clear victory at 1440p this game clearly
loves those multi-threaded CPUs and it's
clearly optimised for them as well
let's move on now to Crysis 3 1440p
ultra we had here 38.1
six frames per second versus 37.6 eight
again absolutely nothing between these
two CPUs in Crysis 3 let's move on now
to some productivity benchmarks adobe
premiere pro cs6 this was with my gtx
970 and ultimately this was the mercury
engine was enabled so i wanted this to
reflect real-world conditions and we see
here the 5820k scored a clear victory it
was a big victory over the 467 TK coming
in at 491 seconds this was to render I
think this was rendering a it was a nine
minute video with a 50 megabit per
second bitrate with the max of a hundred
megabits per second the 4:6 Emenike lost
by quite a bit
coming in at 737 seconds looking at
prisoners I decided to do a music
benchmark for some of those people who
do a lot of mixing and stuff like that
even though I had no idea what I was
doing I just got a trial I pretty much
made this 3 minute and 30 second
copy-paste track and then I just decided
to mix it down and I decided to get some
recording
scores and times on the mix down the
time it took to make the mix down so the
5820k scored six point two three two
seconds versus the four six 70k which
came in at twelve point zero five
seconds so a big victory for the 5820k
here especially for those people who do
music production so the next benchmark
is WinRAR this is this time around I
decided to do a massive fifteen point
five gigabyte file on both 64-bit
versions of WinRAR and the 5820k scored
611 seconds to archive the file on
normal compression and the 4-6 Emenike
took eleven hundred and eighty seven
seconds so this was a big victory for
the 5820k in winrar as well Cinebench
this is the next interesting benchmark
r15 the 5820k came a miles ahead of the
467 TK coming in at twelve hundred and
twelve points contrast this to the four
670 K that came in at six hundred and
ninety seven points so Cinebench clearly
was a victory for the 5820k by a big
shot so let's look at boot times now
boot times of 5820k actually lost to the
four six seventy K coming in at twenty
eight point nine two
seconds versus the four 670 K which
booted up in twenty four point eight
four seconds so Windows eight it loves
fast clock speeds for boot times that's
something to take note there and that's
something I learnt for my learnt myself
with this benchmark now power
consumption before I managed to
reinstall windows I disabled hyper
threading on prime95 because if I had it
enabled the power consumption went
through the roof it was like going up to
four hundred and thirty Watts four
hundred and forty watts
however with type of threading disabled
I thought it was more realistic versus
two four six semi K and we see it still
comes in at a massive hundred and twenty
five watts
extra power this is clocked four hundred
megahertz lower and it was just getting
I mean it was just consuming power like
a beast I mean the four six seventy K
when I clocked that at four point two
gigs that went all the way down to 220
watts so clocked the clock I mean the
467 TK was a lot more power efficient
like a lot more power efficient this
thing just the mean the 5820k
chewed power that was with
hyper-threading disabled so that was I
mean this platform is one hell of a
power chewing machine looking at the
idles temps here I mean the idle wattage
here 133 versus 98 so that's actually
pretty good considering the extra cores
and the fact that the 467 TK goes all
the way down 800 megahertz whereas the
5820k only goes down to 1200 minimum
clock speeds and you got a factor in the
x99 also has a lot more stuff onboard
the motherboard so anyway that's there's
the benchmarks done let's move on now to
a conclusion so this is the conclusion
the part where I give you guys my
thoughts and opinions on the 5820k and
ultimately it boils down to one question
what are you looking for in a CPU if
you're a gamer and you're just gaming on
one high-end graphics card or even to
mid to high range graphics cards then
this CPU is going to be a complete waste
of being money like seriously if you
have a sip 4770k hour for 790 K you're
going to save money not only on the CPU
but you're going to save money on the X
the on the platform you can get a z97
motherboard which comes in a lot cheaper
than the next ninety-nine you can also
get ddr3 memory which doesn't really
make a difference for games
and then you've got the power
consumption this thing used up a
crapload more of power power than the
four six seventy K did I mean this was
in prime95 but even when I was gaming I
tested out a few games when I was gaming
I looked down at my power meter and I
clearly saw that this thing was using up
a lot more than my four six seventy K
ever did so I wish I mean I wish Intel
would kind of copy Toyota and put some
variable valve timing in this CPU that
would be a cool feature but I don't
think that's going to come in the near
future anyway so yeah basically the for
a gamer I mean especially one on just a
budget this CPU and platform is not
really for you however let's look at now
the productivity benchmarks we saw that
this thing absolutely kicked the living
 out of the 467 TK it was a no
comparison so if you're on a budget I
guess if you're on a Productivity budget
if you're going for a workstation an
entry-level workstation then this thing
makes a lot of sense I mean it really
did
especially Premiere Pro and unzipping
things and just making music and
Cinebench it really proved that it is a
CPU ready to do the workload required of
it so it really is one hell of a CPU for
productivity yes it does use extra power
but it does so with results when it
comes to productivity also one thing
you've got is the 2028 PCIe lanes on
this CPU and it kind of puts it in a
unique position where it's in between
the 59 30 K and the four 790 K and I
mean ultimately the 4790k if all you're
doing is making a couple of videos here
and there and we're making music here
and there the four 790 K is still going
to be a wonderful by even the 4690k but
if you're working all the time and time
is money then this thing's going to be a
great buyer even the eight core 16
threads gonna be an 8 by however this
thing can't do what the 59 30 K or the 8
core can do because it doesn't have as
many PCIe lanes but what it does have
over the 4 core is especially an extra 8
lanes so you can put a say a high-end
graphics card like a Tesla and then you
can have another graphics card so you
can have that at 16 speed or in this
persistent speed PCIe slot and then you
can have another greatest card for all
your monitors maybe a Quadra for all you
monitors and you'll have one be set up
and that will allow you to do that this
screw this CPU or allow you to do that
however if you're looking for the best
possible render times then obviously
you're going to go with the 8 core and
that has the 40 PCIe lanes anyway so I
actually kind of in hinds I mean in in
closing I actually like where this CPU
is placed I think it's great that
Intel's offering more options like this
and I was actually kind of impressed
with the Pentium as well the G 32:58 the
fact that they allowed people to
overclock it on a cheap motherboard that
was really good as well obviously the
x99 is expensive that's something that
can't be helped I mean when I'm gonna do
give you guys a review of the msi x99s
own and honestly for the money it's
feature-packed it is when I opened it
out of the box it was a heavy
motherboard and it just came
feature-packed I was actually very
impressed with the x99 motherboard the
memory the ddr4 memory that's just how
it is
it runs cooler uses less power and it's
higher speeds than ddr3 so you can't
really expect the process of that to
come down anytime soon but yeah those
two extra costs are associated with this
CPU so keep that in mind even though
this thing looks good on the surface
every productivity it's great it still
comes with those extra costs so yeah
that's it guys if you enjoyed this
review of the 5820k please leave please
give it a thumbs up it took me a long
time to do I'll be getting a ddr4 memory
review done for crucial very soon and
I'll be giving some tutorials and stuff
like that in the MSI motherboard review
that's coming very soon but ultimately
yeah this CPU is kind of a bit of a
mixed bag I guess if you're also I guess
one more thing I left out is the temps
and how it overclocked as well this CPU
overclocked pretty really mediocre I
mean I thought maybe I had a
below-average chip I mean I got to 4.5
gigs and I looked at the power
consumption I merely restarted my
computer I'm like this this see this
overclock isn't for me like it was
drawing like almost near 500 Watts on
prime95 this was only the CPU before I
even kicked in the graphics card and I
was like no way I'm not using this CPU
with that much wattage from the wall so
the diminishing returns really kicks in
after 1.2 watts as opposed to the 46 70
K we're diminishing returns
kicks in after about 1.25 volt so the 4c
70k will be or the four cores will be
better for overclocking then these eight
cores or the six cores will be that just
can't be helped they're bigger cause
they leak more also the temps of the
motherboard the MSI motherboard held up
perfectly fine with this CPU and on the
sweet spot overclock of 4.2 gigs on this
CPU the Animax t40 did a fantastic job
as well so kudos to both MSI and Animax
and also crucial as well that memory is
running so cool and I've actually been
playing around with it and overclocking
it and over clocks like a beast so
that's one thing as well also one thing
I forgot to mention is the cash ratio as
well on this CPU is clocked at 3.6 gig
and it was surprised because I couldn't
get it any higher than 3.6 gig and when
you look at the other specs of the three
and 59 30 K and the 59 60 X you see that
basically they've got the same cache
ratio speeds as the clock speeds this
one comes in 300 megahertz lower by
default comes in a three gig clock speed
on the case ratio where as opposed to
the normal clock speeds got 3.6 gig
turbo so there's something going on with
the CPU where the cache is maybe
severely I guess inferior to the 59 30 K
out of 59 60 X and I couldn't get mine
and past 3.6 gig no matter what I did
and I was absolutely surprised because
the 4 670 K goes up to 4.1 no problems
so something's going on with the case
ratio there and an interesting thing
with the case ratio is when you
overclock that and you give it more
voltage it actually uses up a bit more
power to I managed from 3 gigs to 3.6 it
used up an extra 20 watts in prime95
where as opposed to my 4 670 K it used
up nothing like a property I could
probably attribute 2 or 3 watts for this
something going on with the case ratio
with the CPU I recommend ultimately I've
got mine at 3.3 gigs a little bit of a
overclock bear on it a little bit of a
tweak and so I'll be coming out with an
overclocking tutorial for this thing
very soon as I've already learned its
behavior and how it behaves but yeah for
me personally you guys know that I am a
gamer and I produce a lot of I guess I'm
starting to produce a lot of content so
I guess I mean at first
was really unimpressed with the CP I was
like damn I wasted my money but I'm
actually the more I use it the more I
start to like it it is a beast and I
mean it does anything that I can throw
at it so I'm left and left at the moment
with the sort of like a you know give it
a mid-range score so can I recommend it
for people yeah even if they're a gamer
I guess looking to upgrade in the future
maybe I don't know I mean I wish
honestly I wish this thing had 32 PCIe
lanes that would make it a really good
killing blow for those gamers who want
to get to grabs cards and just go balls
to the walls like when you know two
really ridiculously high speed graphics
cards come out so that'd be really cool
if they did enable 16 speed on both the
PCI Express 1 and 2 ports that's my only
shame I mean just wish it had 32 but
anyway that's about it from me guys I
hope you enjoyed this review and if you
haven't already hit the like button
please it took me a long time like I
said before and if you haven't already
subscribe to take our city and I'll
catch you guys with a tech video very
