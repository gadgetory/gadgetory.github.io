how I benchmark games especially for
things like graphics card reviews and
also CPU reviews so today I'm going to
go through everything I do and also not
only how you can apply these things to
benchmarking your parts in your computer
but also diagnosing problems as well if
they exist but with that said let's
check out the test bench what's in there
and then get on to benchmarking but
before we do share the skill set today's
video is brought to you by skill share
the online learning community where you
can learn real-world skills and I've
always found it easiest to learn by
watching others and with skill share you
can do exactly that
for instance I'm still a noob at social
media and taking photos for Instagram so
I'm doing an online course covering
social media and how I can improve on
providing a better experience for those
that check out my socials though there's
so many other courses available like
film marketing finance and budgeting and
everything that can help you in your day
to day activities now if you're a techie
yes city viewer you can get access to
two months of Skillshare premium free if
you use the link in the description
below
however this offer is only available for
the first 500 users that sign up using
the link below so with that said let's
get back now to the check yes benchmark
class so here's my benchmark setup here
where I've got a XIII 90 99 hundred K
and currently 16 gigabytes of ddr4
platinum now I did have 32 in there then
you can get higher speeds with just two
sticks and so we're just using 16
gigabytes and since we're only just
testing games we don't need more memory
and so now we've got an RT X 27
installed for today's video and here's
the beauty about this benchmark rig I
can quickly change graphics cards to any
other Nvidia card in this case because
I've got the Nvidia SSD over there setup
but if I'm changing over to an AMD
graphics card and then change the SSD to
an AMD install and then I can test those
AMD cards out in terms of the upcoming
x5 70 AMD processors if I want to test
them out I can then just quickly take
everything off the test bed here and
then put the new motherboard and CPU on
and then use the same memory and we're
good to go so definitely a benchmark
setup like this
saves you a lot of time
so what we need to benchmark our
software now is three different
applications two of these applications
come in the same package that is MSI
Afterburner and also river tuna
statistics now for this you will want to
get the latest version and actually keep
this program up to date because if you
don't then games like Apex legends for
example can lock you out and the program
won't work if it's not the latest
version I had this problem and then I
updated it and the problem went away now
we'll get on to heaven later but this is
a fantastic utility for overclocking and
quickly getting over clocks as well as
just checking things out because if
things crash then you can quickly reload
heaven I find it very efficient and easy
to use and with that said though all
these three applications are free to
download and use so I'll put the links
in the description below for you but
let's get on now with MSI Afterburner
the first utility and it's so powerful
for not just benchmarking but also
telling you and diagnosing problems with
your system but we'll get onto that
later let's start the tutorial and how I
do things and I'm just going to go
through the settings and if you guys
have any problems and be sure to drop a
comment in the comment section below if
there's something you don't understand
and just holler at me any time and I'll
get back to you but here we go to start
up we want to left-click this I like
this program loading when windows loads
up
well then left-click on the COG wheel
here now they've got all these little
hints and tips I'm just gonna quickly
turn them off so they don't distract the
tutorial as I'm gonna be explaining
things myself but what we want to go to
now is just the general settings tab and
we want to start with windows start
minimized as well as for me personally
since I overclock and I use this program
to overclock I'm gonna unlock voltage
control and unlock voltage monitoring
and then we're gonna click apply and
then we're just going to restart the
application load back in and then left
click on the cogwheel again and then go
over to the monitoring tab which is the
most important part with this software
if you guys see in the top left hand
corner of the screen all that fancy
information that a lot of benchmark is
use this will be because of this
monitoring section here in conjunction
with River tuner but basically before
gaming today we're just going to
show you the most important stats then
you can have up while you're monitoring
as well as some additional things that
you can do with this software but what
it's worth I'm just going to monitor and
keep on GPU usage GPU temperature also
memory usage and core clock as well as
memory clock itself so we know how hard
our graphics card is going and if you're
on a potato then you will want to
disable as many of these as possible
so the software isn't causing any issues
with your benchmarking we've also got a
16 threaded CPU here the 9900 K but I
only am interested in monitoring the CPU
temperature as well as the CPU clock
speeds and also the usage rather than
monitoring every single individual
thread it's just going to take up a lot
of clutter and since I know the 9900 K
or 5 gigahertz pretty much the best
gaming CPU can get that's not gonna
really cause a problem at least in
today's tests we've also got RAM usage
as well I like to keep this up here to
know if a game is utilizing RAM or if
any background applications come into
play then we'll be able to monitor that
too now here's a tricky one here with
this software this is actually pretty
important if you're doing time to
benchmark runs like I'm doing a lot of
people like to just enable framerate
average as well as the 1% in point one
percent lows but I actually just clicked
the framerate here and then I click
showing on-screen display
then I click left click here go graph
and then I click the three dots I like
to scroll all the way down to the bottom
here and then go to graph and click the
little drop down menu and change that to
diagram and graph style click OK and
then we can go back and all these other
ones that we left checked we can then
click left click showing on-screen
display and so what this is gonna do is
it's going to now show up when we launch
applications in the top left hand side
so we can run a quick test once we've
enabled showing on-screen display on all
these different settings here and just
to test if it's working so then click
apply click OK and then in the case of
UniGene heaven just make sure that it's
running and yep we can see straight away
that we now have the information being
displayed up here in real-time
and that is essentially the first stage
to benchmarking but again there's so
much more we've got to do in order to
get benchmark runs so let's get back to
that quickly and get back to that
cogwheel left click here and then what
we want to do is go over to on screen
display and now I like to hotkey this to
f12 and so this enables me to if I'm
capturing gameplay and I don't want
these settings sort of getting in the
way if we got menu items and we're
looking at menu items in game then I can
quickly turn the software display off by
hitting f12 that's how I like to do
things of course I like to show on
screen displaying caption videos turn
that off as well click apply then go
over to the left click the benchmark tab
and I like to set my begin recording and
end recordings to different hotkeys so I
use f7 in this case and f8 to stop the
recording in the case of ending the
recording you will want to tap that
twice so then it logs the data into your
benchmark folder so what we're gonna do
here is left click browse and go to the
desktop
left click desktop and I've got a folder
here so make a new folder and call it
bench armed Kay's said if you want to
follow me and then just open your folder
in there and then click apply and that's
where now our benchmark numbers are
going to be saved for later use now also
what you can do with this program is
profiles go over to the profiles tab
here and this is for me it's important
when I'm doing overclocking settings I
like to set f5 and f6 to two different
profiles and we'll see why this is so
powerful in a second because I click
apply and what we've got here now is
afterburner itself with our overclock
settings so we can drop core voltage
back down when we just drop it back down
to defaults and then click Save to
profile 3 now for overclocks I have
overclocked this card already and off
the top of my head I believe it was at
34 millivolts and the levels were about
I think 188 or something like that
and then the memory clocks were just
under plus one gigahertz and then 80%
fan speeds so we can have overclock
profile like this save that to four and
now if we hit our hotkeys we can see
that we can quickly change between our
over clocks that easy so when we're
benchmarking we've done our three runs
with these stock settings if I'm getting
overclock numbers for you guys I can
then quickly just change to my overclock
profile and then run the benchmark three
more times hence why I really like this
program it's just simple straight down
to business and it's very efficient to
use so that's the first stage done we've
got overclock blocked in and in order to
get your overclock numbers guys that is
a different topic for a different day if
you want to see a video on that I can do
one for you on how I fast track over
clocks but that's the other clocks
locked in that is msi afterburner it's
ready to benchmark but let's go over now
to the next program here and that is
river Chenab so this one here is very
powerful it's pretty much the bread and
butter to afterburner without this
you're not going to be getting any
numbers because this is actually the
backbone where all the code is so I like
to start this with Windows as well
application detection level I have never
come into any problems leaving this on
low so I usually leave this on low and
I've not come into one problem yet now
if you're on a potato leave this on
vector 3d me personally I've got a
decent computer I can turn it to raster
3d left click that little icon and I can
customize the text if I want to I like
verdana bold so we'll leave it on that
on-screen display coordinate space leave
that on viewport and then you can also
have your own on-screen display shadow
right here now show under statistics I
like to leave this on and also I like to
at 1080p make the size of this graph a
little bit bigger than the default
setting so make sure it's just a little
bit big I can see my numbers if you're
at 1440 PM h to make a bigger 4k yet
again bigger again because once you up
the resolutions this actually gets a lot
smaller so for 1080p i like to just make
it a little bit bigger 1440p there for K
bigger
so that's usually how that works now
everything is ready to go I accept I
think setup we can also display the
maximum frame rate which is important
we'll talk about that after we run some
benchmarks and also we can take off the
enable frame rate limiter and then click
OK and now we're ready to do our first
trial run with MSI Afterburner let's
left-click that Run button here so now a
new 2g in heaven we can simply hit f7
start our benchmark and we can see here
we've got all our stats live while we
are benchmarking now this is the most
important reason why you turn off frame
rate average as well as 17.1% lows in
the actual afterburner monitoring if you
leave them on this is not going to
display here and why this is so
important is it actually gives you a
timer for how long your benchmark is
running for and so with that I can leave
it running for 32 seconds and then I can
hit f8 right on 32 seconds and then I
can hit it again to save that text in
the folder and so that's one benchmark
done we can then repeat this another two
times for you guys
so after we've done that we can then
left-click on our folder that we created
before with our text folder that we
created before as well then we see here
that the three runs that we did are now
logged in to this file then from there
we can use that data for our benchmark
so ever with the heav'n benchmark you'll
notice here that we tested at three
different places so the FPS is on three
different settings so it's not accurate
and this is the thing with benchmarking
we'll see this soon when I test the
games you want to test apples to apples
to apples across all different
benchmarking results that you do and
then you want to monitor these numbers
to see if there's any outliers now with
inbuilt benchmarks before we move on to
the games maximum frame rate is very
important I like to keep this setting up
here especially if we're checking out
those in-game benchmarks which I do use
because they are simple to use you can
do other things while you're just
watching that benchmarking you know your
system is 100% the one thing to look out
for with those is the maximum frame rate
to make sure they're not skewing the
results either towards AMD or Nvidia and
a game that I know in particular that
used to do this with shadow of mordor
their inbuilt benchmark had really
stupid maximum frame rates at some quick
points for the AMD graphics cards and so
when I tested in game I got different
numbers to that of the actual inbuilt
benchmark itself but if you run this
through on say for instance shadow of
the Tomb Raider you'll see that there's
no funny buggers going on then you can
reliably use that benchmark to give
people numbers for GPUs 1% 0.1 % lows
are very important just for seeing if
there's any stuttering and if say for
instance drivers that come out are
unstable for that particular game but
also for CPU testing as well to see
especially if we're testing like csgo
for example if there is any stuttering
and if that's due to your CPU and your
configuration itself so now what we will
do is we'll run through three different
games here and show you how I benchmark
in game and get the numbers that I get
both normal and overclocked so we'll
start off with Resident Evil 2 and just
quickly go through the settings here
which will be 1080p
hi and just that directx12 and they jump
straight into the game and we can see
automatically that my cpu is not being
utilized hardly at all so it's actually
clocking down to 4.7 Giga it's at some
intervals which isn't a problem because
the frame rates aren't being affected
here we can see what the frame times
everything is very smooth if that does
spike you'll be able to see that in this
graph you know that it maybe there's
some stuttering or something's going on
but what we've got here is I like to
walk to an area where I can test
straight apples to apples so that
benchmark is going to be pretty much the
exact same across all different hardware
that I'm testing so I like to run over
here and there then resets the screen to
the same area where I can then just hit
W and f7 at the same time and then just
walk along here for 32 seconds the
magical number test that three times now
also hello Brad speaking
so now we've finished three different
benchmarks on three different games
getting both these stock and overclocked
figures we can see here that we can
separate the games and the actual runs
with stock settings and then our
overclock settings we see here that
we're getting pretty accurate results
but in this case I would select the
median out of these results you can
average the results if you like two of
these three runs but again then you're
making up a number that actually didn't
happen on that particular hardware so in
this case we'd pick the one hundred and
ten point six and this one would pick
the ninety seven point seven and that
would be our stock and overclocked
figures keep in mind this RT X 2017 that
we have here this particular sample does
run pretty well when it's overclocked as
we can see here with all the numbers
dirty Raley 2.0 is we're getting a
sizable boost from overclocking and we
see with the 1% in point one percent low
numbers to that everything is running
really smooth nothing's out of the
ordinary
same with Resident Evil 2 we're getting
very high FPS numbers but do keep in
mind when you look at these results and
say for instance if you pull up these
results compared to another benchmark
run that I've done they're actually not
comparable because I do forget what
settings I use in older benchmarks but
when I run all my benchmarks for a
particular video I'll keep that in a
sandbox closed world and that'll be
apples to apples to apples with in that
video and it's the same with other
benchmarks you can't go grab my numbers
and go compare them to other people's
numbers and say that this particular
person is right is getting more numbers
or is getting better results than you
when they could have tested different
settings I could have had window mode
open versus full-screen mode the list
goes on on what can happen but one thing
you do want to do with your numbers and
when you're running them for giving
people advice is make sure everything's
apples to apples within that scenario
but with that said what can we do now
with afterburner
to make sure everything is running right
with our system well here's where we can
go a little bit further in depth with
the main monitoring settings themselves
so if we left click the cogwheel and go
over to monitoring we can then click
these three dots here and this will
enable us to bring
more information so if we left click
Perth County here this is giving us
access to all the settings that Windows
has and we can monitor them live within
After Burner itself for some reason with
the recent patch update from Microsoft
Windows like I've been using this
software for years now but for some
reason just before I made this benchmark
video Windows introduced an update and
now my hard drive usage won't show up so
that's just super annoying like thanks
Microsoft but other than that once that
gets fixed hopefully it gets fixed soon
we can then add other additional
parameters in here and I'll show you
guys soon like so many different things
and it's very powerful for instance if
we want to see if our CPU is running in
full state all the time we can then
unlock the percentages of C 1 C 2 and C
3 States and then add them in and then
see when we're benchmarking if the CPU
is idling or going into any of these
states then with our rig we may then
have to on top of that disable any turbo
settings you can also use the network
QoS policy here to monitor packets that
are dropped or dropped per second so if
you guys are having stuttering in online
games but not in single player games
then you may wish to enable these
settings and monitor how many packets
are being dropped while you're playing
games that way you can see if you've got
an internet problem or a problem on your
neck or a problem in the line and the
list goes on if we look at all the
settings that we can play with here
there's just so much we can doing it
actually in itself opens up Pandora's
box in relation to cache settings and
other certain access that we can get in
relation to CPUs so one thing I'm going
to be looking at when we look at the
Verizon 2000 version is the new 3000
series which will be released later this
year as I'd like to go a little bit
deeper into these settings here but of
course time limits me from doing these
things as you guys see the channel is
just so busy at the moment but that's
essentially what you can do with this
software and why it's so powerful in
essence to not only just monitoring your
game
and getting benchmark figures but also
diagnosing problems too as we can see
here now these new settings see three
times C two times and C one time are
displayed I used to have hard drive
displayed as well but that's gone now
unfortunately and that was useful if
you're running a potato hard drive and
you want to see if that is getting in
the way of any benchmarking that you're
doing because a lot of people complain
to me my brakes stuttering why is it
stuttering this is one of these settings
that can just eliminate that and you can
monitor real-time so if we see here
those C 1 C 2 and C 3 states we can see
how much time is being spent in those
and we can see if these are getting the
zeroes are changing in these and we may
have to change some settings on our rig
if the stuttering is a problem or if the
1% point one percent lows are quite low
and so if they aren't low in this case
all the benchmarks we ran here today was
silky buttery smooth so everything is
running well on this rig well that said
let's move over to a conclusion now you
guys when it comes to benchmarking
that's how I get things done efficiently
effectively for you guys and I hope this
tutorial helps you also cross check
numbers with us reviewers we aren't
right a hundred percent of the time and
God knows when I get these new products
in and they've got such small deadlines
I'm very prone to making mistakes as we
have such a short time to get out
results and then cut the whole video and
make it for you guys and try and get it
done by NDA time especially nowadays
with some of the times that we get like
two days before at least sometimes I
even get them on the day they're
supposed to be released in that case I
am late with the NDA time but I do get
things done now with what I've said also
in terms of how other tech reviewers are
doing their benchmarks and methods they
use I actually don't know when I haven't
talked to other tech reviewers on how
they do their benchmarking I just think
with afterburner it's so much better
than fraps it's so much more powerful
because it can inject itself into dx11
dx12 and also things like Vulcan and
I've never had a problem with it it
gives me the 1% point 1% lows straight
then and there I don't have to do
anything else I get my 32 second bench
it's done and everything is home and
hosts so easy to use so effective so
efficient but you guys know that's how
the yes-man rolls I've got to be
efficient otherwise techie Oh City
unfortunately will drop off and join the
dark side if that happens that's just
the way YouTube is in 2019 and I hope
