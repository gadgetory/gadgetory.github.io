massive boom in the industry of gaming
grabbers cards to the point where
they're now sold out and the prices of
currently available GPUs have gone
through the roof quick response if you
guys want to Jays to census video is
that yes he does make a valid point it
does suck if you're a person getting
into PC gaming and you can't get one of
these graphics cards and you just saved
up but on the other side of the fence it
is a free market and not everyone can
win all the time though instead of
making a video complaining about the
issue I'm just gonna offer you guys some
simple solutions and help you guys get
through this sort of out of stock
apocalypse now we'll say one thing
before we get on with the video is that
currently stock in the u.s. is where the
problem exists in the UK and for in
Australia for example GTX 1060 s are
still readily available and you can buy
them at pretty good prices and what
about the higher end GTX 1080p eyes well
in Australia for example there's
currently a sale on at the moment on
eBay we can get a 1080i for around 900
Australian dollars which is actually a
really good price for a card with an
aftermarket cooler installed so of
course what are some of these solutions
let's find out
welcome back to tech yes it is brian
coming to you guys today and first up if
you are in america and you want to buy a
new graphics card or you want to buy a
new gaming pc they currently are two
things available in stock when i did a
quick search gtx 1084 560 u.s. dollars
not too bad of a price also a 1050
currently in stock for around one
hundred and forty now of course they are
a little bit more expensive than they
usually go for but i guess in this
current market you just have to take
what you can get also if you sign up to
auto email lists on you egg for example
you can get notified as soon as the
graphics cards are back in stock and get
one at retail price not only can you do
that but you can also check daily on
amazon just refresh quickly for one
minute check if some graphics cards that
you want to get back in stock and then
pull the trigger if you want to get one
of those at the said good price
alternatively though if you want to
build a new pc then you may wish to go
with a pre-built system that includes a
keyboard and mouse for example the
CyberPower pcs i know tech deals raves
on about how good value for money they
are and in this market they're even
better value for money with ddr4 ram
prices being sky high and also gravis
cards being out of stock so that is an
option seven hundred and sixty dollars
roughly for a PC with an Rx 580
installed and then also for around
$1,700 you can get a full 8700 K
top-of-the-line rig with the GTX 1080 so
yes you will generally pay a premium as
opposed to building a new especially if
you're used to getting deals when you
buy those new parts but as I said before
this is not a bad solution in the
current market of course if you are into
price performance here is another
solution I'm going to propose to you
especially around this channel tech yes
City we love to look into use price
performance where there is extremely
good value for money and for instance if
I pull up Gumtree right near by me there
is a GTX 780 which will be absolutely
fine for 1080p gaming and not only that
it performs very similar to a GTX 1063
gigabyte model now this is 180
Australian dollars which would be like
150 USD now now I guarantee you that I
could put in an offer around 150 Strain
dollars which would be like 120 US
dollars and I'd probably get the deal
done so that kind of performance for
that money is really good now if you are
in other parts of the world and this is
affecting you especially the ddr4 memory
pricing another solution
is to go over to Aliexpress now I've
used I express a lot and I haven't been
burned once and that's actually better
than eBay so the sellers of course it
does take a little while to get things
shipped to your door but currently there
is a really good combo on a motherboard
a CPU a six core 12 threaded Sandy
Bridge Xeon which is overclockable 16
gigabytes of ddr3 memory for 330 dollars
shipped to your door
I've actually ordered one of these
because I'm gonna do a video on it and
test it but a lot of the viewers out
there they tell me this is a really good
combo especially for the money so if you
want to build a really good PC you can
get this a $30 cooler which I've
actually already tested and you'll get
really good price performance for your
money though of course solutions don't
just stop there you can get those used
OEMs which generally come with a Windows
license a 4 core Sandy Bridge CPU egg
you lots of ddr3 memory they go from a
hundred to two hundred dollars sometimes
you can get them even cheaper just
chucking the gtx 1050 and you're good to
go in terms of 1080p gaming anyway guys
when it comes down to it there are
solutions you've just got to spend a
little bit of extra time and look for
the best options available there
generally are always options available
you've just got a hustle now with the
used PC price market especially the
gravis cards they're generally anti
minor minors generally don't want to get
these gravis cards because they use a
lot more power than say the latest ten
series cards and of course with that
they produce more heat which is hard to
keep under control if they've got to put
in an aircon environment and they've got
ten or twenty of these used Graham's
cards going I generally want to go for
the new Graham's cards where they can
purchase 10 plus or twenty thirty grams
cards at a time and set them up with
these as opposed to use gratis cards
they'll have to run around all around a
certain suburb and chase up all these
deals and of course that being a
convenience problem for people who
generally want to make money out of
crypto currency and I've been accused as
well of being part of the problem and
actually I would say I would
counter-argument that and say that no I
used review samples mainly to check out
what's going on with crypto currency
gain an understanding of it and in that
time I went from being relatively a
naysayer of crypto currency to
supporting blockchain technology and
with that over the last year I have
built a lot of use price performance
pieces on the channel sold them to
people who aren't fortunate enough to go
out and build a new PC and they're
getting extremely good value for money
so please if you're in the comments and
you're accusing me of that bullshit you
need a stop buddy anyway in terms of
doing my part for the PC gaming
community I always do and I always will
I'm always on the side of the gamer
it's just in this case I do believe in
blockchain technology I do believe in
crypto currency and of course the money
that I made from cryptocurrency is
supporting my channel which I so very
much love I know guys hope you enjoyed
today's video if you did then be sure to
hit that like button and let me know in
the comment section below if you have
any solutions of your own and also on
that note I do believe the ddr4 Ram
prices to me that's much more of an
issue than the graphics cards grabs
cards are constantly being put back in
stock and they're coming back in at
retail prices the ddr4 thing is a big
fishy issue to me I think there's a lot
of funny buggers going on behind the
scenes things like price fixing because
it doesn't make a whole lot of sense
they run these excuses and we have seen
this in the past with RAM numerous times
and in the past there's just been some
excuses that didn't make sense at all so
I think that's a problem and of course I
have provided a solution to that in this
video all the links for the products
that I've talked about will be in the
description below so you get yourself
back on top or you can tell a friend
look these are some solutions to get
into PC gaming if you're having trouble
at the moment and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
