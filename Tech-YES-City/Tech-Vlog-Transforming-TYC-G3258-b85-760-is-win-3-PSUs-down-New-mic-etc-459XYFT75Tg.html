Bharani Z and I'm coming back to you
guys today with a vlog about everything
and everything that has gone on in the
last week around here so as you can see
I have a completely new backdrop I'm
gonna talk about that quickly after I
talk about this I know you guys have
been dying to know the news with the
32:58 and the b85 and it is good to go
it surpassed all my expectations I was
so impressed with this rig it's not
funny so I'll be doing a full review on
it soon
I've also got a gtx 760 in there and the
pentium at 4.2 gigs on the stock cooler
handled the 760 absolutely fine it was
absolutely an impressive gaming
experience so i'd even say it would dare
step into the 1440p budget sort of
medium settings build as well but
honestly for the money if you guys are
thinking about getting a budget gaming
rig 32:58 gigabyte b85 motherboard good
to go highly recommended pull the
trigger gtx 760 is fine with that as
well so next up is well i am using a new
microphone this is a condenser
microphone it's called a 770 it's from a
brand called MXL so let me know what you
guys think of the audio my bearing of b1
died so I can no longer use that and I
had to return the 82 or 3/5 so expect a
review on this in the future this is
actually the first time recording so let
me know about the audio now you could
probably even wondering what has been
going on with this room so I've
literally put down a whole new heap of
gyprock in the background plastered it
up painted it and then put some aqua
blue like if the paint is aqua blue so I
hope you guys liked this new backdrop
I've sort of gone for the clean look as
people are right in all those boxes in
the background were kind of scary but I
only did that because the Japanese homes
literally the old-school Japanese homes
they look hideous so I had to kind of
make some backdrop anyway this is a new
backdrop I've got going on this is gonna
be for the tech reviews and when I'm
just talking about products and I'm
talking to you guys directly and then
I've got another backdrop where I'm sort
of going with that guy I don't know like
a
dark space-themed and that's where I'm
gonna go with that for the Tech Talk and
the budget builds when I need to use my
computer so with the budget builds I'm
gonna sort of do a new style where I'm
talking maybe I want to discuss things
more with you guys about the budget
builds so I'm gonna try and change that
up a little bit instead of just throwing
the parts out there and talking about
the parts I want to talk about maybe the
experience a bit more so let's move on
to the next part and that is what has
happened in the last week wow I've been
thrown out boxes I've been just
literally cleaning out this place it was
a dump and yeah so many boxes went out
my Transformers collectibles all got
stacked nice and tidy so they're all in
the corner still they're all good to go
and we've got a new mario star which I
won from a test skill test oh so I guess
I've got some skills
so another reason why I've been gone for
so long is that literally Wow three
power supplies so when I took my power
supply out of my main wreck the earth
was 650 watt bronze and put it into the
penny and build I decided to use this
1200 watt power supply from hunt key and
I thought well it's a power supply
that's 1200 watts it's gold rated it's
gonna be absolutely awesome and I
couldn't be more wrong I couldn't have
been more wrong like wow the fan was
noisy the connections didn't plug in
properly to my graphics card the rear of
the the actual power connection was like
as when you tapped it a little bit the
whole thing switched off so I was
actually really surprised at how bad
sort of like the quality control was
with this power supply even though
they've put good components in there
even though the gold rating was working
as well I mean it was an efficient power
supply so it's just a shame that the
didn't work as I expected it would and
so with that I'm gonna be selling this
power supply most likely to someone in
Japan as it weighs like three kilos so
International shipping would be huge and
you're probably wondering what's with
these two left the power supplies in the
background well when I took that hunt
key power supply out I decided to try a
let the power supplies I hear they're
from the same company ZeniMax and anyway
I ordered one from Amazon and it came
and it was dead on arrival which
actually which which actually
enlightened me I mean
kind of glad that it happened now
because it's something that I wanted to
talk about with you guys and that is
should you test power supplies before
you actually hook them up to any
components and in my opinion you guys
should like I'm gonna start recommending
to test them for an hour before you hook
them up and there is an easy way to do
that you just hook two wires together I
will be making a video about the
dead-on-arrival power supply and how you
can test your power supply by itself
without hooking up to any components
because honestly it's scary if you have
a faulty power supply from the factory
it can damage components which is a
really scary thing I'm lucky that all my
components are working fine as you can
see here here is a new earth is playing
in the background and it's playing off
this power supply so it's really good it
works fine I mean the replacement works
absolutely fine the fans quiet the gold
rating lives up to the gold rating and
yeah I mean the one that works is
absolutely good but the dead-on-arrival
one that was sealed from the factory
kind of scares me so I'll be doing a
review about this as well it'll kind of
be I guess a little bit mixed I mean the
power supply now that works does work
really well it's just that I'm a bit
sort of bit shocked at a few little
things so I'll be talking about that
soon as well so the last thing I wanted
to talk about is also my health as well
while was moving everything in this room
I was lifting up this desk with the
monitor every all the hardware on and
all this other stuff and I actually got
a herniated disc and that hurt a hell of
a lot so anyone any of you guys that
have had a herniated disc before you'll
know how much it hurts so I had to go
the doctor and I'll bed-bound for a few
days as well so a lot of things that
happened in the last week and yeah I'm
actually getting better now which is
awesome so I'm recovering quicker than I
thought I was and I'm actually able to
get this video done for you guys today
so that's what's happened to me in the
past week in the next few weeks there's
gonna be a lot of tech videos coming for
you guys a lot of the juicy intricate
enthusiast tech videos and I know you
guys love will be coming and this game
here I love it it's here as a new earth
and I I'm addicted to this game for some
reason but anyway you can see that the
gloss monitor this is emulating sunlight
into this room a lot of it actually and
you can see that yeah the gloss monitor
does reflect a lot of light as well so
that's something to keep wary of but
anyway that's
I'm done vlogging I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did please
give it a thumbs up if you have any
questions or anything you want to ask me
please leave a comment in the comment
section below and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can I'm actually recording
off my DSLR as well with the stock kit
lens so let me know what you think of
that this is all everything's changing
around here and I hope that's for the
better
so anyway peace out for now I'll catch
you guys with another tech video very
soon it will most likely be the
dead-on-arrival power supply and how to
spot a dead-on-arrival Pasqua and anyway
catch you guys peace out for now and I'm
gonna roll that outro booyah bite</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
