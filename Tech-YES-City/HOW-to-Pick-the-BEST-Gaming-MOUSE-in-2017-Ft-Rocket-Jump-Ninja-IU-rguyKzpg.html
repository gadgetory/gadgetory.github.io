today is a very special day because I'm
joined by rocket jump ninja zai and yep
you're only gonna see a hand in this
video but he will bring a big face
reveal and it'll be on his channel first
and then I'll be on this channel on
another video but today we're going to
pick out the best Mouse from my hand and
Zeiss certainly has a lot of tips and
tricks actually it before of them in his
handy bag so we're gonna get onto it and
see which is the best mouse for me in
2017 so here's my current mouse this is
the Logitech g3 and I'm joined by zai
and now this has been my favorite mouse
of all time and it's actually still my
favorite mouse in terms of ergonomics so
I've noticed with your channel you've
reviewed over like literally over 100
Mouse what would you recommend as an
upgrade for this I tell you what right
now I don't know we're gonna find out
though I haven't actually tried the g3
before but just by Phil I can tell that
it's similar to other mice and even once
by Logitech so I think we should be able
to find a new mouse but one more
question I have before we get on to this
is that I've tried in the past a G 100's
and it just hasn't been the same as this
I don't know what it is of course you've
got the side buttons here on the g3
which I believe the G 100's didn't have
but there's also something a little bit
off with the ergonomics this was just
almost perfect I think that's the best
fingertip Mouse crib I've used in terms
of ergonomics but the G 100's just
didn't have that same feel so we're
gonna get onto some of those different
recommendations I think that zai has for
us now
all right I'm going to need to see your
hand first
because measurements do matter when it
comes to choosing mice so first of all
you want to flatten your hand out keep
the fingers on the palm so you want the
thumb flat against that - and I'm not
going to do this exact because I'm going
to redo this format at some point but
this will give you a general idea of how
to actually measure your hand and get
the right mouse for you so first of all
we do the length measurement just choose
one of these lines so bad there would be
okay and to the top of the middle finger
there so we're looking at about 19 and a
half centimeters you don't have to be
exact
just get a close enough measurement when
it comes to the length that's more about
how you grip the mouse it's not going to
be about how you're weighing how you're
weighing is across the end so we take
the measurement and right here against
the film over to the let's say the white
part of the hand there so let's just
call that about ten and a half
centimeters so 19 and a half by ten and
a half what I've found is you want a
mouse it's about 60% of those
measurements that's going to help you
aim best especially the width 1/4 grip
style that's all about comfort so if you
got a long hand you want a mouse that's
gonna be pretty long as well two to one
ratio is usually about right but every
hand is going to be different so try to
get one 60% ahead of the measurements so
ideally you're going to want a mouse
that's fairly wide but that's more for
the comfort and I know a lot of people
do prefer smaller mice now especially
for when it comes to aiming so in theory
you'd probably want a mouse like the
Death Adder
which is about 6 centimeters across here
it's more like six point one so very
much right for your measurements but
because I know you like smaller mice I
won't be recommending this one however
if you just came to me and said I like
palm grip and I want to Mouse for these
measurements for your hand size the
Death Adder really is probably one of
the best ones you can get but now that I
know you like fingertip grip thinking
that you're going to like the FK series
or maybe even the CA 12 these mice are a
bit smaller than what I'd recommend for
you but if you use them and they're
comfortable enough they should help you
a me extremely well it's actually just a
comfort problem with the small a nice
for you because measurements wise your
hand is a bit big for these and because
you like the g3 we can actually find a
mouse for similar measurements the g10
too from Logitech no Knox Venator and
maybe even the FK - I would have said
the Z a 13 but this is a Z a 12 so it's
a bit bigger
all right so after that testing which
one far out to you which one felt more
comfortable so this is gonna sound a bit
weird but the G 100 or 102 is it they
wanted to prodigy it it was good but it
just felt like a little bit off compared
to my g3 in the ergonomics and I'm gonna
say there was the FK - I believe it was
this one just felt amazing like it was
in another class of its own and I can
single it out even though there's all
these mice that look similar to it this
one here it was just incredible it was
like wow I didn't think I could find a
mouse that was like my g3 it was like
the ergonomics was so good not only that
the accuracy the flicking I liked
something that I can flick extremely
well on because I don't do a whole lot
of gaming nowadays I do so much video
editing and I'm quickly flicking mp4
files from my timeline to my bin and
whatnot and it's just it's really good
to have a mouse that I could fingertip
and I could just move around the whole
screen and actually use Mouse
acceleration as well in Windows by
default and so I find this is good for
gaming I just I like to flick a lot and
this mouse was easily the best for me I
felt and now we're gonna quickly talk
about comfort and for me when I first
tried the fk'd - it felt the most
comfortable out of them all it was very
weird because those measurements
predicted that the FK one should
actually be more comfortable and I don't
know what this is I just I tried the FK
- off camera before I started testing
these mice and I just knew this one
would had the best fit for my hand well
just the way I'm used to doing things
maybe and then I tried it on the mouse
accuracy calm and I got the best score
maybe there's might be some placebo but
I guess I know what I like and this one
just stood out so this is an interesting
experiment because as he just said this
mouse should have been more comfortable
fk1 it's larger it's better for his
hands
but he did prefer the FK to now the key
here is that he liked the g3 that
mouse-sized is close to the FK - so what
is he used to
what's more comfortable is actually the
smaller Mouse that is going to fingertip
grip anyway so a small Mouse easy to
move easy to aim and actually feels more
comfortable to him because of the g3 and
the next point is that just because the
right mouse for him is the FK - doesn't
mean it'll be right for you you can have
a top 10 Mouse list and number 10 might
be someone's number 1 it really is a
personal preference thing and because
he's been using the g3 this size is
actually closer to the FK to size so
he's more used to this size
therefore he finds it's more comfortable
and better to aim right now he could
actually get used to another Mouse and
maybe then the FK one would be more
comfortable and that's why his hand
measurements would suit this and that
will work but right now he's used to the
g3 so the FK - is the easier choice so
this could actually be your number one
Mouse - revenger us very good more for
Paul so that's when you actually have
your palm resting on the mouse claw grip
is when you have your fingers up in the
course of the look and then fingertip
sort of stroke fingers and it's more
just right out into your fingertips now
one of the most common questions is
which is the best sensor all these mice
here except the g3 have good sensors so
that's why we're focusing so much on
shape and feel now because we've got
such good sensors it's really not that
important anymore so when you're looking
at one of the top mice especially in my
top 40 or top 20 even you want to just
look at what's going to be rough for
your hand size your crip style and
overall comfort as well sensor is not
that important anymore and looking at
these sensors the only ones in the top
ten are pretty much one SATA like the
3360 like in the Cougar Avenger s that's
actually known as the top optical sensor
now and therefore be top sensor on the
market that you can get but because
Zowie have such good shapes even though
they're using the 3310 sensor which
isn't as good people still prefer to buy
these mice the only issue that you're
going to find with these is if you tilt
the mouse and then slam it down the 3310
can spin out that's why we're trying to
move to the 3360 it's a lot harder to
make
happen on these so now basically with
mice it really comes down to you at the
end of the day what is best for you and
ultimately I believe what desire was
telling me was that you can only be the
judge of what will be best for you but
I've also got some questions now for him
that I'm really curious about and the
first of which is which is eyes favorite
Mouse of all time
the best Mouse for me is actually the FK
- which is the same as you now your hand
size is quite a bit bigger than mine but
still we both prefer the same Mouse so
what would be interesting is if they
bring out an FK 3 even smaller than this
and see if I prefer that but right now
FK 2 is the king for me I can aim
extremely well with it I've got over 19
years playing quake and this is the best
Mouse for me so now in Turtles I with
you reviewing over a hundred different
mice on your channel has a company or
have you ever designed a mouse for a
company personally or has a company ever
taken all your critiques and sort of
made a perfect Mouse according to what
you've recommended so first of all I've
actually only reviewed about 90 mice but
this CUDA revenge' s is actually a mouse
that took a lot of my recommendations on
from the original version which was your
revenge' and made them on this one and I
must say this is why this mouse is
actually in the top ten now so first of
all they've separated the bottoms from
the shelf
I have heard they haven't done it
properly or most companies don't do it
properly it's only Logitech that do it
so don't quote me on that one just yet
we're still looking into it they removed
a Ledge just on the base here which was
causing my thumb to slide up so now I
can actually grip that properly there
aventure was 111 grams this one's about
95 96 grams and most competitive gamers
prefer mice under a hundred grams again
it's personal preference if you prefer a
heavier Mouse then get that but most
people seem to prefer a mouse under 100
they're also used to be some fangs along
here and they used to dig into the mouse
pad so they remove those they actually
made a fair few changes just based on
the recommendations from my community
and my reviews
have I actually made a mess or
recommended them to make a mess of my
designer anything no but this is the
closest we have actually seen that have
really listened to the feedback from my
community and given us an excellent
product so now this would be my final
question with the revenue s it looks
like more of a palm grip is Mouse now I
do like a palm grip Mouse but it's more
for only fps and certain type of SP fps
say for instance sniping and csgo when
it comes to flicking like Cod for
instance I like a fingertip grip but
with this do you use a palm grip mouse
personally and if so what do you use it
for or do you like the fingertip grip
better than the palm grip
okay so interesting story I was using
the death out of five years and I just
realized that I couldn't aim too well
that was in palm grip of course so I
started trying different mice and I
realized that the smaller mice were the
ones that I could aim better and even
though the ec2 bee or ec2 way at the
time felt amazing in palm grip as soon
as I tried the FK - it's actually too
low that's about three point five
centimeters tall it's too low to really
palm grip properly so I switched a
fingertip grip and ever since then I've
preferred fingertip grip so you can't
actually change your grip style you're
not actually locked into one and it does
take some time to get used to but now
I'm always fingertip grip my aim has
improved a lot and it's not just some
mouse size it is actually the grip style
I feel like I have more control with it
so that's about it for me today really
that's all the questions I have desire
he's answered that and so much more
about mice it's really awesome
I'll put the link in the description
below for his channel big thanks desire
for taking his time to come out and help
me here today he does live over an hour
away drive but it's awesome to
collaborate with him and with that said
I'm gonna be making a PC a whole PC
frame I'm gonna be overclocking it
tuning it getting quite champions
running for him as best as possible with
FPS so stay tuned for that that buddy
will be coming to the channel very
shortly as I'll also have his own take
on this PC as well that'll be on his
channel so look forward to you guys

pretty good for the price if you really
want a bad mouse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
