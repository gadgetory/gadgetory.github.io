four core four threaded CPS's finally
here in two different flavors that's the
1200 and the 1300 x now going to be
testing both these CPUs with a gtx 1060
and a 1080 however I will say that I
absolutely love the 1200 because AMD
have allowed this CPU to be overclocked
on budget motherboards like the b3 50s
and when I did this in pub gee that's
player unknowns battlegrounds it's
scored phenomenally well beating out the
G 4560 which is already a very popular
option for budget minded gamers but also
competing with CPUs that are almost
double in price for particular games so
today we're going to be taking a look at
this CPU more in depth and seeing who
exactly is it for welcome back to tech
yes Sydney today we're taking a look at
the 109 dollar rise and 3 1200 and also
the 129 dollar risin 3 1300 X which in
my opinion are suited perfectly for
someone who wants to get into gaming
with really good performance on a budget
however without wasting any more your
time let's take a look at those
benchmarks
so as always the benchmarks do the
talking but what we saw with the risin
312 hundred and even the 1300s is that
you will want to overclock these CPUs in
order to extract the most performance
out of them keep in mind the G forty
five sixty is still a really good choice
if all you want to do is save money and
not go into the bar and change any
settings that coupled with a gtx 750ti
or rx 470 or IX 570 will be a very good
proposition for gamers still though
where the Rison 3 1200 really shines is
when you start overclocking it so as for
the rosin 3 1200 seriously if you're not
into overclocking at its stock speeds it
does perform similarly the G 45 60 in a
lot of titles so with that I will be
bringing out a rising free overclocking
tutorial very soon for you guys and all
you have to do is go into the bar to
change a few settings and should be at
least hitting 3.8 gigahertz and now at
these speeds coupled with the GTX 1060
you'll get phenomenal performance and
not just frame rates but also a very
smooth experience I found it to be quite
smooth in games like players unknowns
battlegrounds as opposed to the G 4560
which had a little bit of stuttering
compared to the four core four threaded
variant and now in terms of the physical
specs of the CPUs themselves the 1,300
and the 1200 will be identical CPUs when
you run both of these CPUs at 4
gigahertz on all-cause which in this
case both my samples went up to these
speeds with the included race stealth
cooler and the temperatures still had a
good 10 degrees breathing room this is
at a 25 degree ambient temperature in my
room so really loving what this cpu can
do AMD have included a really good stock
cooler as well that would do a good job
of cooling and staying quiet as well
there's a 1300 X let's quickly talk
about that 129 dollars if you aren't
into overclocking at all and you want to
get a really cheap motherboard like an
a320 as tech deal said in his videos
this is a very good value for money
proposition for that gamer who just
wants simplicity and ease and still gets
good results thoughts on that note with
the risin 3 1200 it didn't just do well
in games when it came to productivity on
a budget this thing did extremely well
the one thing I will point out with the
G 45 60 and also the Rison 3 if you guys
are into 4k video editing
and you say for instance recording 100
megabits per second footage then I
highly recommend upgrading to the
horizon 5 1600 as on both these CDs I
did encounter some sort of sound
skipping when I was testing it out so I
believe it's just too weak to do 4k
video rendering though if you're into
1080p video are ending are you into
doing some budget productivity than the
rosin 3 1200 will do extremely well
though when all said and done the 109
dollar for core for threaded CPU from
Andy actually reminds me of those days
where we got the x58 motherboard i79 20s
and we extracted a lot of performance
out of them for nothing this is exactly
what you're getting here and not just
that the beat 350 motherboards if you're
going to get one of those have a really
good upgrade path so if you want to get
a fork or four threaded CPU now gain
pretty well and in the future you can
upgrade to a rising 7/8 core 16 threaded
beast and you'll be able to save a lot
of money and still get really good
performance as opposed to upgrading your
whole system also what about those
higher MTB you say for instance you've
got a bit more money then I highly
recommend the rising 5 to 1600 with 6
cores 12 threads it absolutely dominate
productivity and also if you want to get
into streaming this would be the CPU for
you of course the 7600 K and also to
7700 K still have their place in being
the absolute high FPS King for
competitive gamers although they aren't
that good in terms of price performance
in my opinion so there's lots of
different options out there though when
it comes to this bracket the Rison 3
1200 is winning pretty hard
so with all said and done the 4 core for
threaded option is still very relevant
in today's games although there is a big
push for games to support more threads
and more cause as in the cases pub G
with its recent optimization update
which when I looked at it further it
actually still is very dual-core
predominant and that's why you saw a lot
of the results with the rising 3 1200
when it was overclocked comparing very
similar to the 1600 in a lot of titles
with the GTX 1080 so 4 cores 4 threads
still here to stay this is a very solid
option that does better than the G 4560
especially if you overclock it though
keep in mind if you're not into
overclocking at all the G 45 60 is still
a very good proposition in terms of
value-for-money I just believe that
rising three twelve hundred please guys
get this thing and overclock it and
you'll be having a great time anyway if
you enjoyed this review then be sure to
hit that like button if you have any
questions or comments about today's
games like csgo dota 2 or any of the
other games that I tested and be sure to
drop a comment in the comment section
below and I'll catch you guys in another
tech video very soon and also a build
arise in three mini ITX builds - stay
tuned for that and also my friend over
at hardware unbox he has a heap of
benchmark for his tested more games and
I have to go check out his video if you
want the more in-depth testing on rise
and three and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now -
