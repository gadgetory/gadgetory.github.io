Australia I came back to a chair that
had a rusty back support and that fell
off and so I had to buy a new chair soon
otherwise my back was going to be
crippled anyway I went on eBay in search
of a new chair in search of the best
deal and what I found was an ergonomic
chair for 120 austrane dollars shipped
but the question remains is it any good
let's find out
welcome back to tech city this brand
coming to you guys today with the review
of an eBay
ergonomic chair now I was in the market
for a chair and there's all these
explosions of gaming racing chairs and
whatnot now I've tried a lot of
different chairs over the years and
there was a chair that was similar to
this one in Japan called the Jew arrest
now this chair is easily going for over
400 Australian dollars adjusted and so
when I go back to Australia looking for
something similar and when I saw this
chair on eBay for $120 Free Shipping I
thought well why not give it a try and
then getting it shipped in unboxing it
it took like two minutes to set up which
is the most easiest chair in my life
that I've ever set up I sat in it and
after I sat down in this thing I was
shocked it was that damn good it was
just as good as the one that I tried in
Japan if not a little bit better as it
has this sort of mid backrest support
thing going on there that is extremely
comfortable and not only that the chair
is like literally got the back of it has
a 360 degree rotational support thing
going on where it just sticks to your
back 24/7 I was just that damn shocked
at how comfortable this thing was from
the get-go
now before I hype this thing up I will
point out some of the negatives it does
feel a little bit cheaper than
definitely more expensive chairs out
there though that being said it doesn't
feel flimsy at all also the side note is
it won't support people who are really
big so if you're over a hundred
kilograms or over 210 pounds for example
and you're over 6 foot 2 then this
chairs probably not for you but if
you're under that if you're under 6 foot
to under 100 kilograms then this thing
will be super damn comfortable for you
I'm about 80 kilograms or 180 pounds now
let's quickly talk about adjustments you
can adjust the height of this up to 7
centimetres and also the backrest you
can adjust the stiffness of that to make
it really stiff or make it pretty loose
or somewhere in between also for the
armrests they are pretty sturdy too I
managed to do a tricep workout on these
and they held up perfectly fine they're
also really comfortable in practice the
chair is also able to rotate 360 degrees
and it also has five wheels on the
bottom so I can move on carpet or tiles
with ease looking at the material used
on the back and bottom rest of this
chair it does use a sort of sporty mesh
type
cereal that wasn't too stiff it was very
soft especially for your bum your bum
will sink into this though if you do
want to get some extra support then you
can buy a latex pillow off eBay for an
extra 10 or something dollars and that
will make it much much more comfortable
then moving on to the last part of this
chair is the neck rest which is height
and swivel adjustable so you can adjust
it to your next size you can also remove
it completely like I'm doing for this
review just so I don't look that awkward
while I'm on camera so there we have it
the ebay Korean dog anomic chair and I'm
quite simply blown away by this thing
for 120 Australian dollars shipped to
your door I mean the value for money is
incredible it is arguably one of if not
the most comfortable as chair of trade
in my life and for 120 Australian bucks
which is like 90 USD I can just yeah go
out and get one do yourself a favor that
is if you're of a small or medium
posture if you're a guy girl you know I
mean if you're a really large guy or
you're a really large girl then you
might want to look elsewhere but if
you're a small or medium posture then
you're going to love this thing
absolutely incredible for the money now
the sellers got also a black and green
model I got the old black model as I
didn't want to get called an nvidia
fanboy so if you're in america or the UK
if you're in america then there is a
chair i saw for like 220 bucks and if
you're in the UK then there was like a
40-pound chair and you can just add in
like a lumbar support rest for that
though as for Aussies if you guys are in
Australian looking for a new chair the
damp get on this thing quick because
after they sell out then I'm pretty sure
they sell or just jack them up get some
new batches in and just jack up the
price so yeah that's that
anyways that's about it from the eBay
chair if you like this review then be
sure to hit that like button and let me
know in the comments section below what
chair are you using at the moment I'd
love to hear your thoughts and opinions
as always in the comments and I'll catch
you in the next Tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
