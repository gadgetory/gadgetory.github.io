I'd be moving to a new studio and today
marks the first day where we're gonna
start moving however it's not like a
typical move and there's a lot of work
to be done so here we are at the new
studio and it's essentially not a studio
at the moment it needs a lot of work but
if I'm gonna be cleaning up all the crap
here today and then we're gonna start
battening the walls and putting the
gyproc on and then we're gonna turn this
into a whole new studio and it's
actually really big so I'll be able to
do a lot of work here so I'm super
excited super pumped let's clean this
place off so the sun's coming down and
we've just finished up working I'm
exhausted early today I finished filming
the can yes fix it and that was a really
cool video I hope you guys enjoyed that
and honestly here's the progress so far
so it's pretty dark but here it is here
this is the progress that we've made so
in a few hours we've cleaned up a lot of
the mess so I'm going to now head off
and get some dinner and then tomorrow
get back into this and start attacking
it and yes that is graffiti on two
counts behind me
so now it's day 2 of moving and it's in
the afternoon and man I've been gone
through all my stuff and there is a lot
I didn't realize I have this much stuff
like it's borderline hoarding but I
guess it's not hoarding if you recognize
the problem and you're gonna fix it so
with this move I'm gonna take the
opportunity to get rid of a heap of
stuff and with that I realized that I
had a lot of like Lego and Transformers
collectibles but I guess that was buried
away behind my brothers stuff so I kind
of just forgot about that
but now that it's resurfaced I'm going
to definitely get on that and sell it
and make room for the tech in the new
place and with that I did buy a lot of
tech recently with use pots hunting
especially in Japan with x58 stuff and
of course every month I just continue to
buy good deals so gonna get on that and
make a lot of builds for you guys so
there's gonna be a lot of builds hitting
the channel in the next month so stay
tuned for that it's gonna be crazy
use price-performance builds everywhere
so if you love that kind of stuff if you
love the cleaning wd-40 alcohol wipes
brake cleaner then it's gonna be hitting
the channel and it's gonna be hitting
the channel hard now there's actually
some really cool stories behind some of
the stuff that I have here now if you
guys didn't know my channel name
originally was Brian easy and that was
just my gmail account because I had an
ebay account when I was in my 20s and
when I first went to Japan I was just
teaching English having a lot of fun and
also got into eBay and just buying and
selling some stuff and hustling on the
Japanese side of things and then selling
it in to Australia or the US and one of
those things was these r2d2 collectible
speaker things I think those are two are
five or something like that there was
another one and this was a skill test
sauce so there was a place called die
kay in this huge arcade place and they
had skilled testers where you put a
dollar in and then you try and get the
prize and then I saw these Star Wars
things and I got one with like two
dollars and then when I saw it
essentially said it was only available
for the skilled testers and I thought
wow I mean two dollars and I'm like
because I had this method down pat
push it near the hole and then just the
second time I'd push it in and it just
yet kept spitting him out and it was so
funny like the first time I got it I
went and cleaned the whole place out and
I asked the people at the store I might
look can you restock this because I want
to keep winning these things and they
just told me to you know get lost and
after that I went back you know the next
day and just I cleaned out the whole
machine and the funny thing was getting
him for two dollars and you're selling
them for like forty five dollars a pop
and I remember that that was the r2d2
speakers so I left two of them just as
like a sentimental thing to when I
actually started sort of wheeling and
dealing and hustling and now this next
story I got for you guys is actually
pretty funny I was just cleaning up now
and I found this Canon kis 6 TI it's
like it's a different version maybe like
the 650d I actually haven't even checked
yet but I remember I was buying and
selling the full lens kits when they're
on sale with like some campaign you
could get like two per person and get
$100 off each of the cameras and then
what I did I bought the cameras in Japan
took out the kit lens is both the kit
lens and sold them individually sold the
bodies individually and then I just made
like $200 a pop so you know the yes-man
was always here from the start even
before the channel began it was here and
it was just hustling so there's a little
story with that and I've actually got a
body a Canon body here that I didn't
even know that I had it's always
surprised I must my brother must have
taken at home ages ago and I didn't know
I had it so now I'm gonna use it and
give it a try I don't know how good it
is but I actually had some Sigma lenses
that I was gonna use for a canon C
Series but instead I chose to upgrade to
the Sony path with 4k filming because
everyone just says they've got a lot
better value for money when it comes to
filming professionally so one more thing
I had that I found pretty funny was the
keychain a Rubik's Cube keychain now I
got this ages ago this was again when I
first started hustling and wheeling and
dealing this one I got these Rubik's
cubes they're like Speed Rubik's cubes
and they were going for it in Japan for
like $15 a pop and because Rubik's cubes
are really
at the time I think this guy made this
YouTube video and they were just blowing
up route everyone wanted a Rubik's Cube
and so I realized I was like damn okay
if Rubik's cubes are popular I got these
Japanese ones that are made for like
speed and competition and always popping
them for like 40 dollars a pop buying
for fifteen popping them for 40 and I
was just make him some profit so that
was another cool endeavor that I went
down and I kept the keychain as a
souvenir to remind me of that so now
another really cool one that you guys
are gonna love is probably this I found
this on a junk hunt this was a Athlon
3500 plus it was in box and same with
the motherboard the 888 in sli so I got
both of these and I'm planning on doing
a real like old-school build with
something like this a 1600 XT so it'll
be kind of like this old-school build
that can probably maybe play an
old-school game I remember neverwinter
nights or boulders Gate 2 was really
popular around when this technology was
released so I'll probably build a
computer and play one of those games so
that'll be really cool I know you guys
will be excited to see how this potato
can play may even put a modern day game
on this thing who knows and now probably
one of the last cool stories I have here
for you guys is this thing here this is
a Dell server board and it can fit two
LGA 775 CPUs or 771 sorry LGA 771 so
I've got 2 X 54 60s in here and I've
also got the accompanying ddr2
registered ECC memory so I'm gonna drop
that in and we're gonna have a really
interesting build on our hands and
you'll probably like oh damn how you're
gonna get that power supply actually
remember in Japan I bought the
accompanying power supply for it so
that's the accompaning power supply
we're gonna put that on this and
hopefully do a really weird build I mean
it's gonna suck for gaming admittedly so
if you guys want to see something that
this would be good value for money let
me know in the comment section below and
I'll make it happen maybe maybe for some
kind of productivity it would be pretty
good value for money I mean the board
was like really cheap I think I picked
up the board for like 10 bucks these are
like really
as well the x54 sixties actually haven't
checked the price lately and but the
power supply was expensive was around
about $30 so it's a 700 watt power
supply that was a little bit expensive
but because you need those proprietary
connectors to connect up and I mean like
the amount of time you're gonna waste
trying to hack and slash something
you're better off just trying to buy the
original power supply and get it to fit
and that's what I've done so if you guys
remember the judge I might have also got
the r2d2 and the Darth Maul as well so I
got all three in this set because they
are pretty cool mugs and I picked them
up really cheap when I was deal hunting
in Japan ages ago so actually a lot of
you guys have been asking about the
mining rig and you can see here it
switched off because the Internet's
turned off but I'm actually gonna be
taking it to my friend's house he's
offered to set up the other four he's
already got for his house he's gonna set
up the other four and I'm gonna have all
eight of these house until I get set up
and established but a lot of people are
asking me about how profitable will spin
what's the ups and downs of it I
actually haven't really looked at it yet
I've just kept mining and letting it go
I'll probably make a video on the next
two months once I've got real concrete
data on power consumption once that
flows through and also profits because
the stuff that I'm mining is just up and
down like it's it goes up and then it
goes down and then it goes up and then
it goes down it's really chaotic at the
moment for the prices of the stuff that
you're mining so I'm not too sure yet
guys I will update you though on this
whole endeavor though there are some
other cool things around here this boyar
I bought this and I actually tried it
out and it's got like a little bit of
hissing if you put headphones on it's
got a little bit of hissing it's not
that good at all
i Wisel I'm gonna return it and get
something better you guys will spend
like a little bit extra say like 20%
extra and get something that sounds like
literally like two or three times better
it's got no hissing it just sounds full
this thing here I'd listen to it
critically with my you know studio
headphones it just sounded pretty bad so
I'm gonna return that but another thing
that you guys are probably dying is
seeing since we're moving out of this
place it's the perfect opportunity and
that's to chuck all these parts that
don't work chuck them into the oven at
this place
chuck them into the oven and see if they
turn on so you guys have requested
this every one of these parts you like
dude chuck it in the oven so we're gonna
chuck them all in the oven and probably
make a separate video on that and see if
we can get any of these parts working
with the oven technique so if you guys
have some really cool tips and tricks to
get these anymore life out of these pots
then again drop them in the comments
section below brothers so the sun's
going down a little bit and I'm actually
still got to move a lot of my stuff
behind me and take it to the new place
now so it's just busy busy busy
this move is absolutely crazy but of
course it's good just it's a change and
it's gonna be a change for the better
I'm probably gonna turn this moving
series and like the new studio into like
a three-part series because it's huge so
hopefully you guys enjoy every part of
this and now there's one little problem
and that is we've got to get out of here
and hand the keys over in like four days
and the new place my media room meant
it's far from finished if you guys have
seen there's a concrete walls there
there's I've got to grind off some of
those steel rods still like take some
panels out still but we've got to get
the plaster is in I think because
they'll be really fast to baton and
sheet that off and then I can drop
carpet in there and in terms of the
painting I don't think that's too
important we can get that paint at any
time because the carpet we're using like
we got a really good deal on this carpet
so I'm not too concerned and I know over
time with like tech rooms and when I'm
soldiering and doing builds and dropping
things I know the carbons gonna get
dirty over time anyway so I'm not too
concerned about the painting after the I
got the studio set up but we're still
gotta get to the end goal and also I've
really only got one more video now on
the new parts backlog and that's an X
399 motherboard comparison so MSI and a
Zeus are also sending over there x3 9
iron variants we've got the asrock one
and the gigabyte one here and that's
gonna be an awesome four-way showdown I
hope you guys get excited for that one
but basically with x3 99 boards they're
all going to be pretty good based on how
expensive they are I mean they're all
pretty expensive and all the motherboard
manufacturers from what I've seen so far
are just stacking out these motherboards
alright guys so we are at the new office
here this is going to be the temporary
place where I'm storing all my stuff in
the back here and then
move down to the media room and
hopefully get that little finished but
anyway guys it's pretty late at night so
I'm gonna get back to the other place
and then go to bed
hey is it cold wallabies my little
Joey's isn't one man for you just on the
side of the right oh look at him gay ma
mysteriously as I love living up here
you got kangaroos and you got like a
view of the city so I hope you guys
enjoyed seeing that little Joey on
camera but I just got back and I found
this and I didn't realize this is my
silver play button from YouTube when I
hit a hundred thousand subscribers and I
didn't even know I got it like I sent it
and no one ever said they received it
because I was in Japan at the time and I
sent it to Australia and dad man
actually got it and he like stashed it
somewhere and I finally found it today
and I was like damn so he is for the
celebration of a hundred thousand
subscribers a little bit late but anyway
guys thanks so much for tuning in this
is part one I think I'll do like a three
part series movies already crazy it's so
insane there's so much to do but at the
same time it's so exciting there's so
many things that now I'm pulling up and
I'm being like wow it's bringing back so
many cool memories so I hope you guys
enjoyed today's move and storytelling
and if you did then be sure to hit that
like button and let me know in the
comments section below what you want to
see me do in that new studio and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
