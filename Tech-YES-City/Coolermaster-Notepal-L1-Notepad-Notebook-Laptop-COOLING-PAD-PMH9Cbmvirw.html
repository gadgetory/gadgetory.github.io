here of a notepad cooler so this is a
cooler master so actually they're pretty
renowned brand um
because they're actually they make a lot
of products for the good for PC for
personal computers so I know the brand
it's actually pretty good brand
basically this is for a 15.6 inch model
laptop and has a 16 centimeter fan and
it's specially I think it's a USB yea
USB power so I got this figure got this
for the whopping price of the top side
down bit we got this for about 20 25
bucks so I was on special at sofmap so
let's unbox yeah the boss is pretty big
any big box line there just be a bit
slower than usual muscle imam's bit
taunt and some camps so basically you
open it up and you basically just get
product that's all you're getting so
there it is guys that's what you get
basically and it's at a nice arc to so
quality it feels like dang a little bit
feels pretty damn sturdy so feels pretty
sturdy the plastic actually feels really
damn good so if we sort of bend that a
little bit it's got a bit of sturdiness
in it I do like to manhandle as people
have commented in some of my other
reviews I do like to kind of manhandle
my products to see you know the quality
of them the initial quality so yeah this
this Coolermaster notepad fit for a 15.6
inch laptop is actually looking good so
far so it's looking the part so there's
the USB it comes out the back there as a
little wraparound
and it's actually the cool thing about
it is it's so there it is there that's
what it looks like there's the USB and
the USB is actually sort of like a
pulsar so you can reuse that USB for
data as it's only you know basically in
other words only a drain
energy so let's give it a try so here's
our testbed here this is a Dell XPS 13
30 so this is actually a 13.3 inch
laptop but it fits on really nicely so
you know you if you have a laptop guys
you I would recommend getting one of
these as you know the reason why laptops
fail a lot of the time is because they
don't have the the cooling and so they
overheat especially in summer so laptops
can really overheat in summer so kind of
that stick pad came off the bottom it's
not to worry I want to check out
performance on this so let's give this a
go so plug it in plug it in
okay so basically guys this is it so
here's the cooler here yeah there's a
laptop on that it's really quite the fan
is really quiet and it's really like
lightweight and cool so this is actually
really good it's going to keep your it's
going to keep your laptop really
lightweight and it's going to keep it
really cool so if you're using a laptop
I recommend you get one of these to cool
your laptop down so that's really like
that is a cooler master and actually the
logo looks pretty cool that you got
cooler master they're pretty stylish too
and it gives you a laptop a nice arc on
it so very easy to use and yeah so it's
really getting to put your hands
underneath it's really venting pretty
well it's nice and meshed so all parts
of your computer can hear right so this
is actually a 13.3 inch laptop and it
fits really nicely so 15.4 inch on the
15.6 inch laptop would be perfect for it
as well so yeah they obviously I think
they have bigger models but this is
actually really good buy so if 25 bucks
you guys are recommended now I'll keep
your laptop nice and cool here guys if
