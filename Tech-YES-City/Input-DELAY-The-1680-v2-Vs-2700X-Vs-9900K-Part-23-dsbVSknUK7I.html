ultimate showdown between the 1680 v2
which is a Zeon made in 2013 against the
9900 k and also the rise in seven 2700 x
two of the best CPUs from 2018 both 8
cores 16 threads both overclockable and
also I'm just going to repeat myself
again before we move into these videos
this series is not about value for money
in fact the 1680 v2 has now ballooned
out in price because I guess there's
some pent up demand for it I originally
picked up both my xeon chips for three
hundred and thirty-nine dollars and
three hundred and ninety nine dollars
respectively these CPUs are now well
over $700 because I guess people just
want to relive 2013 but also for the
guys out there saying the risin 8 core
is only four hundred three hundred
dollars yes I you're beating a dead
horse
I agree rise uns phenomenal value go
watch my reviews on it
go watch the recent video I published
where I think Intel's in trouble this
Christmas because they don't have an
answer to the risin 5 2600 and in fact
my favorite CPU of this year is probably
the risin 5 2600 I think it's phenomenal
value for money comes with the cooler 6
cores 12 threats that anyway with all
that argument aside we're gonna move on
now with the old Xeon from 2013 because
I think these arguments are coming up
now because apparently stuff that is
this old should be in the dumpster but
ironically enough it's beating out stuff
that's coming out in 2018 so I think
that's where these irrelevant arguments
are coming from that I'm not even
raising and I'm actually an advocate of
this video is just taking a look at a
CPU that is now overpriced on the
second-hand market and seeing how good
it is in 2018 nothing more nothing less
and with that aside we've got the input
latency tests here today at a thousand
fps this is what I'm using with my Sony
camera that allows me to shoot at these
levels and the beauty of this at a
thousand fps
that one-frame equals one millisecond so
we can get some very accurate results
for testing input latency between these
three chips when they're all overclocked
to their best water and air levels so
let's get on with it
welcome back to tech yes City and right
here on the desk we have our little
hacked up contraption and when we press
this little button it's hooked up to an
LED light which then lights up to know
that mouse-click has actuated at that
exact point in time and so with our
thousand FPS camera we're now able to
see how much input delay there is
through the whole system so for the
specs with all these tests we're using
the asrock taiichi ultimate boards
across the x4 70 and z3 90 lines and
then for the Xeon we're using the
rampage four extreme and for the memory
we're using thirty six hundred megahertz
CL eighteen on both the Intel and AMD
solutions from twenty eighteen and then
on the Xeon we're using some mia corsair
1600 megahertz stuff and it's CL eight
timings so now for the first test we
have csgo this is actually a brilliant
game for testing total input latency and
after this video I discovered exactly
why we have such a high FPS draw coupled
with the fact that our CPU is actively
at its maximum speeds so there is no
delay through and through this whole
process and here we saw that the 9900
case scored the best time that I've seen
yet seven milliseconds in total input
lag which is very impressive it does
speak lengths towards the mouse that
we're using the Logitech g3 which
ironically is very old it's older than
the Zeon's and it also speaks lengths
for the XG 35 from a Zeus not to mention
the total input system latency itself is
extremely low the worst frame we saw
here was 17 milliseconds and then the
average here was eleven point two seven
milliseconds moving over to AMD side on
the horizon 2700 X we had the best frame
coming into eleven milliseconds and the
worst coming in at 27 milliseconds this
scored with an average of eighteen point
two seven milliseconds a
all the runs and then coming in with a
1680 v2 we got the best response at 8
milliseconds versus the worst at 15
milliseconds this enabled it to score an
average across all runs of eleven point
nine milliseconds so somewhere closer to
the 9900 K here and I guess this
specific example with csgo is the best
case scenario for all different CPUs
that lives across the four different
tests we did here today so we see here
that the both the ring bus CPUs are just
that little bit better than the Zen
architecture when it comes to the total
system input delay
however on top of that it is important
to know that they are both scoring
higher fps in this benchmark in
particular when we look at the previous
videos results and csgo
but still it was interesting to see that
the ring bus 1680 V 2 was coming very
close to the 9900 K in the specific
benchmark though to throw a curve ball
into the equation we are now on the
Windows desktop where we are just simply
testing the reaction times on an idling
CPU I guess you could call it that and
here on the 9900 K we scored the worst
time coming in with 89 milliseconds the
best time 38 milliseconds to average out
at sixty point seven two milliseconds on
the AMD rise in 2700 X it's called the
best at 41 milliseconds and the worst at
64 milliseconds scoring an average of 50
3.1 milliseconds moving over now to the
1680 v2 this got a best-case scenario of
35 and a worst case scenario of 59
scoring an average of 46 point 5 so when
I looked at this second example the
first thing that came to my mind was the
tales of Roche where he used to talk
about the turbo frequencies disabling
him completely for the best possible
input lag and we can see contrasting
these average numbers to the csgo
numbers there is quite a sizeable
difference and since we are idling in
the desktop the processors will
naturally go into a halt State and so
this actually contributes to the input
delays quite severely and so it was
quite interesting to see the Xeon come
out ahead here where it has the highest
idle power consumption but it does get
the best input delay in terms of
millisecond times leading the results
here against both the Rison in the
kay and now moving over to Adobe
Premiere Pro which is honestly where I
spend a lot of my time on a computer
nowadays and we got two different tests
here the first is just a file flick
reaction test kind of similar to the
windows tests and we scored here with
the 9900 Kay a best-case scenario of 32
milliseconds worst case scenario of 39
milliseconds and that's called an
average of 37 milliseconds moving on now
to the Rison 720 700 X scored a
best-case scenario of 29 worst case
scenario of 38 milliseconds and then
that averaged out to 33 point seven so
it again beat the 9900 Kay and then
moving over to the 1680 v2 that's called
a best-case scenario of 28 milliseconds
worst case scenario of 37 scoring an
average of 33 point 3 milliseconds so
coming very close to that of the horizon
720 700 X so after analyzing these
results I then looked at what was going
on with the process at least in an idyll
Premiere Pro and we can see at least
with the 1680 b2 the processor speed is
all over the place so if there's one
thing I do remember it's going back to
some of these guides that I heard way
back in the past where people were
warning about the disadvantages of the
halt States themselves and I guess
looking at this and least comparing
these numbers again to the csgo numbers
we can see this Holt states do add input
delay at least when it comes to Premiere
Pro and windows files now to the last
test we're gonna pull up here is a
premier Pro cut test because when you're
flicking through certain footage for
instance if I'm flicking through voice
work I'll be cutting out blunders and
mishaps and so this test is a guess a
next-level test to see how it interacts
with the file through Premiere Pro
itself and the 99 hundred K here scored
41 milliseconds lowest time and the
worst time it scored 53 milliseconds
with an average of 47 point 3
milliseconds movie over now to the
horizon 720 700 X scored a worst time of
70 milliseconds and a best time of 50
milliseconds with an average of 61 point
5 move over and out of the Z on 16 atv2
that's called a best-case scenario of 31
milliseconds with a worst case scenario
of 73 milliseconds averaging out 256
milliseconds so what's crazy to see the
zealand
both the best score and the worst score
with an average that fit in between the
9900 K and the 2700 X and so really
putting all these results into context
I'm definitely going to be looking after
this video into fine tuning my rig in
that if you guys remember back in the
day they used to be these complaints
about for instance a asrock z77
motherboard always keeping the cpu for
instance with a 3770k at 4.4 gigahertz
and it wouldn't down clock it but this
may have not been a bad thing in
hindsight it may have been a really good
thing and that you still got the power
advantages of holt States because CPU
was constantly at its maximum active
frequency ready to be more responsive as
opposed to down clocking and essentially
wasting your time
so in conclusion with today's video I
guess going into this we've answered a
few questions and that is the higher the
FPS draw the better also if your CPU is
active at its maximum frequency then
it's going to be more responsive but
also when it comes to the software
itself for instance in a engine like
Adobe Premiere Pro what is the max FPS
draw in that in that if we increase the
FPS draw in these programs like Premiere
Pro will that then give us better
response times and I do think it
indubitably will but now the question
going into this video now coming out is
how much of a difference will it make
and also if we set our processor to be
active at its highest frequency that
we've overclocked it to all the time how
much will we then gain out of that in
terms of Rison 720 700 X versus the 99
hundred K though versus the 1680 V 2
there's not a huge difference there's
nothing to write home about
overall the 1680 v 2 did score a little
bit better but it's not a reason to go
purchase this CPU over the 9900 K or the
2700 X unless you are the pro of pro
gamers playing at the top level and even
a few milliseconds could cost you a lot
of money in that case you'd probably
want to get the 9900 K and clock it to 5
gigahertz
even got a little bit of a cushioning
this is such a good hat anyway guys hope
you enjoyed today's video if you did
then be sure to hit that like button let
us know in the comments section below
what you think of today's comparison
also with the price performance argument
again I'm going to reiterate it for the
end time this is not about price
performance of course products are going
to be better price performance as they
go forward if they weren't then no one
would buy them logically anyway coming
out of this video I'm a little bit
bedazzled guess that's the right word
and we're gonna move on to part three
soon with the productivity numbers I'll
catch on and I'll take video very soon
peace out for now bye
