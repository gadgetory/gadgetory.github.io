so people were requesting an intro and I
did one so what do you guys think anyway
let's get on with the budget build this
month we've got a five hundred and
sixty-two dollar budget build for you
guys in the States this is for
battlefield 4 now I've played
battlefield 4 and it's actually not as
demanding as I thought it would be
hence this build for you guys now let's
get on we're going to Newegg and amazon
this month and as always if you can find
the parts for cheaper then go do so but
let's get on with the build now first
part of the build is a rose will a
challenge a micro ATX case now the good
thing about this case is it's $25 so get
in quick with this case it'll sell out
like hotcakes
i think you get two fans with this case
as well which is awesome now for the
power button it's located on the front
here which is good I'd prefer it on the
top but this isn't you know for $25 you
cannot be picky with this it's an
absolute steal you got front panel USB
you got front panel audio ports as well
inside the case you've got a lot of room
despite it being a micro ATX build you
got the top mount power supply here
you've got room for a DVD drive room for
SSDs and hard drives and also you've got
a fan up here at the front and a fan of
the rear now the graphics card will go
here and as you can see is just a huge
extension here for extra long graphics
cards as well and also you've got the
fan blowing air straight to the graphics
card which is awesome so not to mention
it just looks pretty decent as well for
$25 case damn I get me one of them don't
forget to put in that promo code because
it's got $10 instant savings and then
you got fifteen old promo code you can
hit in there so get on that fast now a
motherboard to match this micro ATX case
we need to get a micro ATX motherboard
now AMD on the since we're going with an
AMD CPU today we want to be getting a
micro ATX board so this is from the Zeus
here it's it's a named 3 plus model
board it'll support the FX 6300 and
it'll support two sticks of RAM for the
a gigabytes of RAM in total that we're
gonna put in this board now the board's
just a standard board it features what
you'd want it to feature it has a PCI
Express 16 speed 2.0 slot there for your
graphics card it's got onboard audio
onboard Realtek LAN adapter they're just
the standard deals they're nothing
special but for $45 this motherboard is
an absolute steal I do like the black
and
blues theme on it too so it's gonna go
in well with the case the case is gonna
be black and blue as well anyway we get
onto that a bit later but yeah for $45
really good still on the motherboard
there I really like the price point of
that plus it's from a Zeus Zeus do make
really good motherboards next by the
Bilt EVGA 500 watt bronze power supply
now this thing is ridiculously cheap
it's a very good as very great price so
you've got $30 after 15 dollar rebate so
it's $45 initially you're going to be
getting $15 back in a rebate so this
makes this power supply $30 so damn for
a 500 watt power supply that's bronze
that's freaking damn good amount value
for money so value for money and malware
for money that's what you probably get
anyway so it's got ample amps on the 12
volt rail there you've got a single 12
volt rail which puts out 40 amps which
is gonna be huge amount of power huge
amount of amps for the gram scale we're
putting in today and it'll power
everything else finds so really good
power supply for the money I wish I was
in the States I'd probably be buying one
of these just to keep for a spare I mean
Dan that's good value for money so EVGA
nice buy there so next part of the build
is the AMD FX 6300 so this is the this
is one of the my favorite budget CPUs
because a you're getting six cores
battlefield 4 is pretty much optimized
for everything AMD they've optimized it
for the CPUs and also for the GPUs so if
you're going with the battlefield for a
strictly a battlefield 4 build you want
to get an FX 6300 now the good thing
about this deal is you get two free
games as well so that's pretty awesome
as well I like that and but the main
thing is you're getting six cores that
turbo up to four points 4.1 gigs when
you need it this is all off the stop
heater stock heatsink fan so you won't
have to buy an aftermarket cooler for
this CPU to get decent speeds out of it
now not to mention that it's a 95 watt
CPU so it's not bad um you know it's
gonna play battlefield 4 absolutely fine
so I really like where this CPUs that if
you can find it for cheaper from another
place then do so by all means it's a
standard deal now the next part of the
build is probably the most interesting
part of the build it's the msi r9 270x
now this build I'm particularly doing
this build for 1080p 60 frames per
second which is what I think
most people are going to be playing this
game on now this card's gonna be ample
fine for 1080p 60 frames per second I've
already tested the game on my GTX 670
this game runs absolutely fine on 120
Hertz monitor with a bit of tweaking I
mean everything on ultra doesn't get 120
frames per second at 1080p all the time
but you know with a bit of tweaking and
bit of settings it does get 120 frames
per second on my GTX 670 now the 270 X
is not far behind the GTX 670 and you
know so this card will just smash
battlefield 4 1080p 60 frames per second
no problems now the best solution here
is the MSI solution it's $200 it's got
the Twin Frozr cooler on it it's just
overclocked from the get-go it's only
$200 so let me agree that it's only 200
off it looks amazing it's my favorite
pick out of the 270 X's you also get a
backplate there and it just this thing
will go like a off a shovel it's
really fast so I really like this price
point here I really like what msi do
with their non-reference cooler x' as
well so that's total their 450 $9.95 but
you get $15 over the promo code ten
dollars over the rebate and $15 off of
the rebate on the power supply here so
once we're done there we can move on to
Amazon and we can put in a DVD burner
external USB DVD burner into the cart
now if you've already got a DVD burner
sitting around at your home then just go
use that save yourself 14 bucks this is
just pretty much for an OS install if
you can also install the OS from a US
pendrive then go do that so by all means
we're all about saving money man this is
a budget build so go save yourself some
cash but you know if you need one of
these and this is what I'd recommend
because then you don't have to you know
I never use my DVD burner so basically I
wish I had one of these instead of my
solid DVD burners because every time I
plug it in you know I've got to connect
the freakin cables up this just plug in
power plug in the USB cable you can use
it whenever you want to so really I like
this for the ace of access so anyway
next part of the build is the Crucial
Ballistix sports 8 gigabytes to sticks
you know $67 rams damn expensive if you
guys can find RAM for cheaper than go
so this stuff at $67 is not too bad I
mean it's not the best way for money but
it's not bad because it's got cl9
timings which is $9.99 24 I believe at
1.5 volts so basically this stuff if you
need it to will I guarantee you it will
overclock to 1866 no problems so really
good that's got the heat sinks and it
also looks pretty good now the last part
of the build is pretty much staple I
usually do this in a lot of my builds
this is just a staple product it's the
Western Digital blue one terabyte hard
drive if you can afford an SSD and throw
in an SSD for a really good hard drive
lying around or if you ready got a hard
drive lying around
don't even bother buying this your call
so this is just for putting all your
games on and believe me all these games
coming out nowadays they're like 30
gigabyte installs they're huge so you're
gonna need this space you know i'm i've
got my 256 gigabyte SSD and it's filling
up really quick with all the games that
are coming out now
battlefield 4 I believe was I forgot
it's like a 30 gig at least 30 gig
install so it's huge anyway guys that
leaves the total to once I get the
calculator out here
Amazon's cost price plus new yoke cost
price plus all the rebates and savings
it leaves us build to five hundred and
sixty two dollars and ninety six cents
damn good value for money this thing's
gonna play battlefield 4 really well
better than a console would in my
opinion and also if you like this build
please give a thumbs up if you have any
questions please leave a comment in the
comments section below although the new
youtube comment section is parked so if
you've got something urgent PM me
because I still get p.m. so a private
messages so make sure you send me a PM

something and I can reply to that anyway
