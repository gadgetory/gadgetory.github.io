that's my dual CPU rig in the background
here a lot of people were asking me how
I change this thing since there are a
lot of tricky settings there in this
server motherboard BIOS so today I'm
going to be showing you exactly that
we're going to be going through what
adding cards are use and how I also
quickly set things up in Windows
welcome back to take care City this is
brian coming to you guys today with a
sort of tweak tuning guide for your
jewel xeon e5 26 CPUs now the
motherboard i am using is the as rock EP
2 c 602 motherboard so if your
motherboard is different then you may
have some settings that appear different
though for what it's worth most the
settings will be very similar they may
just carry slightly different names so
once we're in the vise we can move over
to the advanced tab here and i have to
go down to we configuration and disable
that since I'm not using this as a
dedicated server going down to CPU
configuration I like to make sure and
check that all these settings are the
same as they are here for instance I've
got hyper threading enabled or my CPU
cores active and I like to disable
virtualization technology since I am not
using a virtual machine Northbridge
configuration I like to go to
input/output hub configuration here go
into vtd and input output and disable
these and then going down to primary
graphics adapter you want to make sure
this is on PCI Express and your onboard
VGA is disabled if you are using this
for a workstation now our Gen 2 speeds
here are absolutely fine even though you
can set them to Gen 3 I've just found
that with my GTX 970 it actually runs
slightly better on Gen 2 speeds I don't
know exactly why that is but again
that's just my trial and error kicking
in qpi speed C I like to leave a sock on
enabled and the qpi link speed on fast
and the other two you can leave them on
order it's not going to affect anything
in real world memory configuration a
very important tab here I like to put my
memory mode on independent you can set
this to mirroring though it's
essentially what that does is make your
memory raid 1 so your memory is
virtually never going to crash if you
have that thing on crazy setting there
ECC support I like to disable this since
it allows me to overclock my memory
better now if you do need ECC for
instance if you're doing financial work
or whatnot you may wish to have this
enabled it can save a crash in a very
rare instance but for what it's worth I
like to disable it now moving down to
the power limit setting here we can put
that on one and then moving on to just
performance monitoring dfx devices like
to hide that and then again the power
limit Modell
to set that in one which is just on
default and then Numa unified memory
access I like to start non unified
memory access I like to disable that and
then M PST support disabled that as well
moving down to DRAM frequency you have
limited options here though the options
available are still plenty enough for us
to get a great overclock out of the
memory on the server board since the
default for this memory is 1333
megahertz by essentially putting that up
to 1866 and then disabling the ECC
support here I'm able to get my memory
like at pretty much a 50 percent
overclock which is huge for ddr3 memory
especially some of the Gen 1 stuff which
this was in that era in 2012 now then
you rank channel interleaving we can put
that on 4-way and rank into leaving an
eight-way which enables this to be octa
channel memory which is great with those
two jewels eons this so Patrol scrub
demand scrub and data scrambling there's
our server features you can just disable
them unless of course you're using this
for a server thermal throttling we don't
have to worry about that since we're not
playing around with the voltage too much
now going down to the South Bridge
configuration we can just put the
settings on like that if you wish to
copy me since I only use one on-board
LAN port I don't need the other one
enabled I like to disable deep sleep as
well since I don't like my computer
going to sleep on me a USB configuration
have them both enabled ME system that's
nothing really to worry about clock
generator configuration we can disable
the spread spectrum there which unless
you are living in a very sort of
frequency interrupted area you may wish
to leave that enable that's up to you
though it will affect performance or
overclocking performance slightly so
hence I'd like to disable that storage
configuration very important tab here I
like to put my SATA mode in raid so even
if you are not raid zeroing or raid
wanting devices you may wish to put this
in RAID mode anyway this enables you in
the future to change or change drives
add in raid 1 and raid 0 drives if you
wish to and not have to worry about
reinstalling Windows however since I am
using
two three terabyte drives in raid 0 I do
like to have that on and I do like to
turn off the Marvel raid side of three
controller there which just increases
boot times and I don't even use it
anyway
SCU devices like to disable that as well
and then moving down here to super
input-output configuration I just
disable both these ps2 ports serial port
console's console redirection to sable
that since I'm not using you see reports
anyway
voltage control another very important
setting I like to as we can see here
I've got my memory at one point four
volt there honestly for everyday
overclocking I like to set it at one
point four five volt this is just an
overclocking thing where you find a
stable overclock and you just give it
that next step above what you had an
unstable this just makes sure that your
memory is never going to crash even
though unfortunately the increments are
quite large on this motherboard I would
have had to I would have liked to have
had it at maybe one point for two volt
the 1.5 volt really isn't that much of a
biggie because it is running at 1866
megahertz of 1.5 volt a 1.45 volt which
is really good PLL voltage you can leave
them on auto since they are at 1.8 volt
that's about right for this CPU on this
motherboard and then vtt voltage this is
essentially the core voltage of the CPUs
way to set them a 1.0 5 volt and then
PCH voltage I like to have that at one
point one volt
so now once we're done with the most
important tab the motherboard does have
some other features like your fan speeds
which you can set them which I've done
here to level 4 which essentially just
makes them a lot quieter and they're
still able to work perfectly fine now
the CPU idle temperatures here you can
see they're 50 degrees that is a little
bit warm but again the multipliers since
you've got 8 cores and the minimum is
runner is 1200 megahertz they are going
to get quite hot on idle anyhow so
there's nothing to worry about the max
temperatures i've seen on even like on
full load is about 60-something degrees
so they do run a little bit hot nothing
to worry about then system event log I
like to disable that since it's not a
server food options another pretty
important setting if you want to speed
up your boot times I like to have the
from timeout just a one and then also
like to disable the fullscreen logo
after we've done that we can save
changes in exit and we are ready to go
into Windows so now once we're in
Windows we can stress test this system
if you like to and as I was talking
about before the idle temperatures
really aren't a problem or they
shouldn't be a problem so as again I
just boot it up so it's taking a little
bit of time to load up everything but we
can move straight in here to Ida 64 and
we can go to just stress test it if you
wish to so you can stress test
everything in Ida 64 if you wish to
stress this to memory stress case stress
that with you stress cpu so we can do
that for around whatever 10 minutes if
you like to are an hour two hours three
hours it's up to you and you'll notice
here that these statistics you can watch
your cpu cores and see if they get hot
or not and I think that was a website
hot or not calm or something ages ago
but we got here we can see that my
temperatures are perfectly fine even
though I've only been running for 30
seconds but we can just watch that over
say an hour and see if our temperatures
get that hyped at the max I've recorded
I think was like 67 degrees which is
perfectly fine on the Sandy Bridge
architecture and one thing you have to
keep in mind is that I have
spray-painted my cooler master C 212 Evo
coolers white which is not exactly the
best color to be spray-painting heat
sinks in it's actually the worst color
to spray-paint your heat sinks because
it traps the heat in from what I know so
now there's just one more little thing
I'll touch on and that is with the zone
RDG sound car which is a sound card that
I highly recommend for a workstation
like mine since it is cheap it does have
a great onboard mic in port there which
you're going to absolutely love if
you're using something like I'm using
like the V mode of boom Pro now you go
if you want to have the sound card
working perfectly you go get the latest
drivers of years own RDG from this
website and then you install it and then
after you've installed the sound card
you then want to manually extract the
driver from C Drive here so C Drive
windows and it should be in system 32
and then you go to driver store file
repository now you should if you've just
installed it it'll be right at the top
if you do date modified however for me
since I have installed some other
drivers since then it's around about
here so zone RDG so you'll then want to
control copy this and then just for
instance just paste it to wherever you
want to paste it here so we can just
drop it in here this is in my games in
temp and now if I uninstall the unified
drivers I can then go into device
manager and manually install the driver
where the zone RDG sound card is so you
can see here I've manually installed it
so I've got no software I've only got
the updated driver for Windows 10 here
since the Zeus driver themselves from
their website is like back dated to 2013
and it was causing my PC to crash now
I'm not sure about the PCI Express model
I am using the PCI model and I'm having
just absolutely no problems with this
sound card in Windows 10 in both games
and productivity so I highly recommend
it if you install it like I've installed
it today anyway that's about it for me
today guys if you enjoyed this video
then be sure to hit that like button if
you have any questions or comments about
the dual CPU rig in the background here
then be sure to drop a comb in the
comment section below and I'll get back
to you as soon as I can also some other
quick things that I'll touch on is the
windows power management in Windows I
found it didn't really make a difference
I like to have mine on balanced and
disable those deep sleep settings that's
what I've found works best for me your
mileage may vary
though I found it doesn't work it to
make a difference in the workspace also
another thing that I do in Windows 10 is
I do apply my Windows 10 optimization
guide so if you haven't checked that out
and you wish to make the windows a
little bit snappier and get rid of some
of those privacy and basic features then
be sure to check out my guide I'll put
the link up here for you and I'll catch
you in the
video very soon these alpha now by</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
