I feel like it's a better time than ever
to be building either
a new PC or a used PC
and reasons being is, for
instance, today's guide
where I've picked out the
top five hustler specials,
whether you are flipping PCs
or if you're just into building
a budget 1080p gaming rig with
extremely good performance,
this list is certainly gonna tickle
and arouse those senses in your body.
So let's take a look,
what we have on the list.
(upbeat techno music)
Welcome back to Tech YES City,
right here at number one is
my favorite, at least for now,
I've been picking up quite a few of these.
This is the RX 470 or the RX 570;
I'm finding a lot of the times
you can flash an RX 470
into a 570 and vice-versa,
and they are just going so cheap.
In terms of prices, I've been
picking up a few personally
whether it be overseas,
for like 40 U.S. dollars
and in recent times in Australia,
I've been picking up quite
a few for 70 Aussie dollars,
and these are cards with
two fans, great cooler,
and from an unknown brand,
and I'll probably be
doing a separate video
on this graphics card in itself,
because it's an interesting story
and it will help people out
if you wanna sorta get
those X mining cards
but in general, this card, at
1080p, will perform so well.
It'll play all the latest
titles, absolutely no problems.
The four gigabyte VRAM
option is just as good
as the eight gigabyte VRAM
option, especially at 1080p,
if you wanna step up resolutions,
then you might come into
some trouble at 4040p
depending on the game, but even then,
at this price, you are
just saving so much money.
You can generally couple this card
with budget Xeons, for
example, or a Ryzen 2200G,
and you've just got yourself
phenomenal value for money.
(upbeat techno music)
Coming in at number two is again
a deal that is just flooding the market
and this is the GTX
1060, more specifically,
the three gigabyte model.
I find a lot of gamers want to
go for the six gigabyte model,
but really when it comes
down to it, 1080p gaming,
these cards perform very similar.
Unless you need to go for 4040p
with a particular game
that uses up more VRAM,
then the six gigabyte
model may be for you,
but they do command a higher price.
I find the three gigabyte
models, for instance,
can go as low as 140 Aussie dollars;
taking a quick look on Gumtree shows that
there's even decent
deals up there available
for 200 dollars Aussie negotiable,
so you can get that down even further
and that's on a decent
model with a decent cooler.
Again, just like the RX 470,
they perform very similar
in terms of 1080p performance,
depending on the game you
may get a few more FPS
on the GTX 1060, and the RX
470 and 570 and vice-versa.
And this is why this is
coming in at number two
versus number one, because the RX 470,
I just feel is just such good value
at the moment for what it is.
(upbeat techno music)
Moving onto number three is
a card that's a little bit
low in popularity at the moment,
but that means that you can get these
for really good prices,
and this is the R9-290 or R9-290X,
and you can have a lot
for the R9-390 as well,
see if that comes up on a deal,
but generally you're gonna get a card
with at least four
gigabytes of VRAM on board;
this is absolutely fine for 1080p gaming,
especially Ultra on a lot of titles,
and like the RX 570 and also the GTX 1060,
it performs in a similar ballpark
except a lot of times you can
get this card for very cheap.
Even taking a look on
Gumtree at the moment,
these cards are going for
around 120 dollars for a 290X.
Of course, not as good value for money
as the RX 470, in my opinion,
but it is a card to
definitely take a look for
if the other two cards are
not going for good prices.
(upbeat techno music)
Coming in at number four,
especially coming up to Christmas,
is an interesting option
because it's the GTX 980
and I'm actually finding these
are popping up for sale quite a lot.
Currently there's one for
sale for 200 Aussie dollars
which is an absolute
bargain in my opinion.
You get a four gigabyte VRAM
buffer on these graphics cards,
so for 1080p gaming, it will be very good.
It generally performs quite a bit better
than the GTX 1060 and also the RX 570,
especially at 1080p gaming.
And so this card, even
if you push the settings,
it'll go well at 4040p, and
especially at the price,
it's one card to definitely
keep on your radar,
and especially since it's Christmas,
a lot of people who have GTX 980s
will most likely wanna
upgrade to an RTX 2080 Ti
or a GTX 1080 or a 1080 Ti,
and so they'll let their
980s go for pretty cheap,
despite them being a very powerful card,
even to this date.
(upbeat techno music)
And coming in at number
five and last on the list
is the GTX 780 Ti,
quite a beast of a card
back a few years ago,
and still quite a good
performer in today's dates.
It'll perform similar
to a GTX 1060, RX 470,
especially at 1080p gaming,
but it will use quite a bit more power
so you will need a better power supply
than the first two
options in today's guide.
But it's definitely a card
to keep a lookout for,
if you can't pick up any deals
on the before-mentioned options.
And of course when it comes
to putting a card like this
into a build, and if
you're gonna resell it,
it's definitely got a big cooler on it
and it will look pretty
good in the photos.
And of course, there's
gonna be a lot of cards
that didn't make today's list,
but the first two options, I feel,
are just abundant in stock,
and the demand for them isn't so high.
For instance, when we
look at a GTX 1080 Ti,
they're actually in very
high demand at the moment;
I can't find any locally
for a decent price,
and when I look on eBay,
they're still commanding
quite a premium, and that's because
people wanna upgrade to them,
so when that demand's high
and the stock's sorta limited,
then you will find
yourself having a hard time
getting a good price on some
of these graphics cards.
So hopefully today's
list gives you an option
on what to look out for
to get the best deals.
Of course, if you've
got deals of your own,
then drop them in the
comment section below,
as I love reading your thoughts
and opinions as always,
and I'll catch you in
another Tech video very soon.
Peace out for now, bye.
