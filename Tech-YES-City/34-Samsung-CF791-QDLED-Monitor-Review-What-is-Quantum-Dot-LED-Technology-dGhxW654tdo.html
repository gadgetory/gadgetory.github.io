of the price tag that it carries for
being a high-end monitor it features a
100 Hertz refresh rate wide VA panel
1500 R curvature and thank the heavens
above has much better backlighting and
it's been standard white LEDs this is
the Samsung C 34 CS 791 34 inch
ultrawide monitor and let's take a look
at why this thing is just so damn good
welcome back garden for a long time we
have been getting duped by the monitor
industry with essentially what is called
a white LED which are of course called
blue LEDs with a yellow phosphor coating
that makes a white light these are the
LEDs are going to the majority of our
monitors and even TV now the problem
here is that when you have a pure white
picture on your screen this so-called
white light is actually sourcing the
majority of the light from the blue
spectrum with a white LED now you may be
wondering why is this a problem well
it's been from the fact that the cones
in the center of our humanoid eyes are
made up of predominantly red cones
roughly 64% then green at around 32%
then lastly comes blue at around 2 to 6%
and furthermore right in the center of
our eyes there are actually no blue
cones at all so in other words seeing
detail through blue light was never
intended for human eyes which makes
white LEDs arguably the worst back
running to ever go into a monitor period
the pre-existent C CFL or cold cathode
fluorescent lamps we're much better in
contrast pushing out a white light that
was derived from firstly green then red
then lastly blue so why is it that these
white LEDs ever made their way into
monitors in the first place well quite
simply money lower production costs and
easier marketing like oh my god 1,000%
brighter and more energy-efficient etc
is what made white LEDs a short sell for
companies that opted to use them however
the samsung c 34 has what is called
quantum dot LEDs which are the ones
inside this monitor and are very
different in one regard they use nano
crystals which when absorbing the blue
light behind it spit out a pure green
and pure red depending on the size of
the crystals this now gives you a wide
light that is made up of much more green
red
and hence will allow your eyes to see
detail much better then a white LED
otherwise could provide not only that
your eyes will be less strained as a
result and you will get a richer picture
which is where I think people arguing
this monitor is oversaturated maybe a
little mistaken but rather their eyes
may need to adjust to having been
treated so poorly by inferior technology
for years on end as oversaturation
usually produces the thing called color
bleeding and out of the box there is no
color bleeding at all this rich or
vibrant picture as I would rather call
it is absolutely fantastic
the light any gloss coating is one of
the most effective I've seen yet
providing a clearer picture yet still
blocking out annoying reflections then
there's a 100 Hertz refresh rate on this
monitor which has support for AMD
freesync technology ranging from 48 all
the way to 100 Hertz on a 34 inch wide
screen with a resolution of 1440 by 34
40 pixels on a VA panel moving on you
have a low claimed response time of 4
milliseconds with overdrive on and it
offers three different overdrive
settings I opted to leave it on the
default setting for faster and of course
it's both relatively low input lag
feeding out my other korean monitor here
the monitor also comes calibrated out of
the factory so i didn't have to turn the
brightness down from 100 to 70 and that
is about the sweet spot for me the
backlight bleed on this monitor or lack
of should i say what's the nominal on a
pure black image i didn't notice
anything out of the ordinary and the
white background picture showed great
uniformity the one thing you may want to
take into account is that the closer you
sit to this model the more likely you
are to notice slight color or contrast
shift i recommend sitting about 70
centimetres or more away from the
monitor and it shouldn't be a problem
though when looking in adobe premiere
for example there is a unique thing
where straight lines will appear
slightly curved due to the nature of the
monitor i personally adjusted to it very
quickly and found it to be a great plus
when using all the extra space for
productivity looking over the physical
aspect of the monitor it is height
adjustable but not swivel it comes
preassembled from the factory so you can
just take it out plug it in and you are
good to go it also comes included with a
USB 3 cable power adapter DisplayPort
and HDMI cable though I did have to
manually
changed my frame rate from sixty to a
hundred Hertz in Windows to set this
monitor to the hundred Hertz setting
Samsung also claims as monitor is
flicker free something that I can't
verify with my limited gear the bezel is
also extremely thin so there is still a
black border that surrounds the image
when turned on most likely helping
alleviate any backlight bleed issues
there's also a back plate to help mount
this by a vase of mounting if you so
wish to and the on-screen display is
simply awesome to work with you have
different pre-select modes to choose
from picture and picture mode available
color brightness and saturation settings
and also Samsung's magic upscale
settings available there is a game mode
which does nothing to affect the
monitors input lag and raises the gamma
to levels that I'm personally
uncomfortable with also I did have to
change this from korean to english
language since I got the CF 791 directly
imported from Korea by a seller named
dream seller lastly there is included
stereo speakers which is great for
someone who doesn't care about audio in
my opinion so it is good for Skype calls
and conferencing I found them to be
lacking any warmth and bass and hence a
pair of even $20.00 Logitech speakers
would sound much better in my opinion so
let's talk about price this thing comes
in at 1,000 USD ship but that is shipped
internationally from Korea to your
doorstep on Amazon in the US you can get
this thing a little bit cheaper and you
also have that amazing Amazon support to
go with it so in my opinion this is
finally a monitor worthy of the title
high-end gaming monitor boasting an
exceptional VA panel fast 100 Hertz
refresh rate great resolution and screen
size and more importantly proper
backlighting that won't to generate your
vision over years of youth so there are
more questions you guys may have like
what about for instance OLEDs well after
researching OLEDs apparently they have
their own issues like screen burnin
effects as opposed to this generation of
QD LEDs which have no screens burn in
effect on that note this generational
technology of QD LEDs using this monitor
are photoluminescence that is the green
and red crystals are changed from the
blue light behind it and as such can't
instantly switch off to give you deeper
blacks that OLED otherwise can which
would be the only negative that I could
take about this monitor so on that note
I found the blacks to be still very good
how
this will be rectified I'm sure in the
future when generation to QD LEDs hit
the scene that is electroluminescent
where the individual crystals will be
able to be switched on by their own
current so that is still a few years
away from mass production so the last
question what about the micro board
version for $300 cheaper
well the question you have to ask
yourself is probably this is the much
better back lighting worth it for you
for me personally the answer is quite
simple
I would pay the premium for the Samsung
and of course quality control from a
company I've never heard of first one
that has been around for years with
proper customer support would be another
factor worth considering especially at
this price premium and who has that's
about it for the review if you like this

let me know in the comment section below
what do you think about the C 34 cf 791
from Samsung I personally love it I
think it's great the companies are
finally bringing in much better
backlight technology into their monitors
that are coupled with high refresh rates
low input lags and also fast response
time and you guys I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
