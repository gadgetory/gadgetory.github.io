what I use to record my YouTube videos
with today I'll be showing you guys what
camera I used what tripod I use and even
what lighting I use
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
tech yes City this is brian coming back
to you guys today with quite a long
awaited request to take a look at what i
used to record my youtube videos with
now just like all my other tech around
here my video recording equipment is no
exception to the value for money
orientated stance that I have so pretty
much all the gear that you're seeing in
this guide today or this show all today
is pretty much the best bang for buck
recording gear you can get so first
things first the cameras that I use this
is the Canon EOS m and I absolutely love
this camera it's fantastic value for
money I picked up my first one for
around about two hundred and ninety
dollars about two years ago and that
came with a twenty two millimeter lens
which I'm actually shooting from right
now and these lenses is really sharp
really good value for money now recently
acquired a second USM for only a hundred
dollars so they can be picked up for
very extremely cheap and if you want to
use your standard Canon lenses then all
you need is a fifty dollar canon m
adapter now the good thing about the EOS
m is that you can use a program called
magic lantern and this allows you to
customize many different things to
features in particular that I really
like is that I can up the bitrate and I
can also use movie crop mode which
allows me to zoom in with the prime lens
and essentially not lose any quality in
my recordings now some of the drawbacks
to the Canon EOS m is that it does have
a slow autofocus speed but as you can
see here since I'm doing stationary
style work where the focus is not really
having to change it for me is not a
setback though keep that in mind if
you're doing a lot of sporting
photography or if you're out and about
and you really need a snap quick photos
will take photographs of birds if that's
your thing then you might want to get a
different camera now the second pair of
lenses that I do use with this camera is
a 50 millimeter yongnuo 1.8 aperture
lens this lens can be picked up for 70
or $60 off ebay and i recently did a
review on it and i was blown away by the
quality of the bakit which if you're
doing b-roll in my opinion you will want
some good bakka so for the money
down the best Baca you can get now let's
get on to the next part and this is
audio now I get quite asked quite a lot
about what audio equipment I use however
I do have some different types of
equipment for different purposes for
instance on my desktop I record off a
bearing of b1 going through a mic preamp
though for just doing the videos that
I'm doing for you guys now I have simply
Level II a microphone plugged directly
into the camera and this is another
reason why I love the EOS m if you turn
all the manual recordings down pretty
much to a low setting and you have a
high sensitive lavalier microphone
you'll be able to get noise free
recordings out of your Canon EOS m which
is a great benefit it's going to save
you a lot of time and it'll save you
money because you won't need an
independent recorder like a zoom h1 for
example now what about for
recommendations with microphones well if
you're on an extreme budget I can
recommend you guys the Sony ECM cs3
which is like a $15.00 lavalier stereo
lavalier microphone that'll get you
exceptional recordings from your EOS m
now the lavalier that I'm using at the
moment is a step-up it's a nice one from
a company called noise labs and I'll put
the description in the link below but if
you want to check out the review for
that I'll put that up there as well and
this is essentially just as I said
before a step-up from the Sony it's a
little bit better but it does cost a
little bit more so keep that in mind so
the next thing we're gonna look at is
tripods and also the heads that go on
those tripods this is a very important
thing with recording if you wonder how I
get smooth b-roll then you're gonna want
to pay attention to this part now for
the first one my main tripod this is
what I do my b-roll with I actually use
a amazonbasics
legs with a detached Manfrotto I think
it's 502 a H tripod head now this combo
will set you back around about 250
dollars though you generally get what
you pay for in the tripod world the more
you pay the more smoothie of b-roll is
going to be that's including your pans
your tilts and also the weight and just
durability of the tripod will last you a
long time so when you catch the tripods
if you want to
step it up then I can highly recommend
you do spend some money on a good tripod
and on a good tripod head now that's an
exception to the rule would be the
recent $10 tripod that I picked up I
went to a junk store and I found this
Toshiba tripod just lying around it was
only ten dollars and I was blown away
when I started moving the tilts and the
pans I'll surprised this thing had a
fluid head on it now one thing when
you're looking for a tripod and you want
to get smooth pans smooth tilts you will
want to get a good fluid head tripod and
in my case I got lucky and I picked up a
ten dollar tripod head with a head and
the legs and it just worked out for me I
was really lucky so you might not be
this lucky but just keep in mind that
you can pick up some bargains if you
look around and don't forget to try it
yourself remember the b-roll is only
going to be as good as the technician
using it now let's not forget some
little extra things going on with the
tripods actually on both my a OSM's
I use a macro slider tool and this
essentially is a $20 item which will
give your camera more weight for the
tripod head and I actually have another
reason why I use these and that's
because it allows me to just take my
battery and memory card out of the
camera with such ease so I don't have to
take my camera off the tripod head every
time I want to take my battery and my
actual memory card out so for $20 these
things are really good if you're
shooting video like I'm doing now last
but not least this is the lighting and
it's a crucial element of any good
recording at the moment I've got I think
three different separate independent
light sources we'll actually four if you
count the monitors and that's a lot of
lighting up the I've got one on the
ambient light and I've got two for my
face you can also decide to put in hair
lights and stuff like that but the main
thing is you want your subject which is
in this case is me lit up very brightly
so if I for instance if I turn these two
softbox lights off you'll see the
difference
and you'll see that it just doesn't look
anywhere near as good at what it is what
it did before so if we turn those back
on so you can probably see the
difference between having no lighting
and having lighting now also I've got
the ambient light which i if I turn that
off I've actually never done this before
I don't know how good this will look it
might give my whole video as a real dark
feel to it I don't know let me know what
you think of this look but I've got an
ambient light which pretty much lights
up all the background here so I'll turn
that back on so once you've got all your
production gear set up that's your
lighting your tripod your audio and your
camera and your lens you'll need a good
piece of software to post produce the
recording that you've just produced and
in my case I use a program called Adobe
cs6 Premiere Pro that being said though
there are many different alternatives
out there and which one is best for you
it depends on you the user so I suggest
maybe you try a few different ones see
which one suit your new needs but keep
in mind that Premiere Pro is sort of a
very in-depth program that has a lot of
features and once you know how to use it
I can highly recommend it though the
learning curve is a little bit steep so
keep that in mind and with that being
said the alternatives I think are like
Sony Vegas 13 Final Cut Pro and there's
also Microsoft moviemaker as well if
you're on an extreme budget so keep in
mind that some of these software
programs will cost a little bit of money
as well now lastly let's tally up all
the costs if you want to start getting
into production then I'll put a base
needs cost here that's if you want to
get decent video like I'm using though
just below that I will put the extras
and how much or all the extra gear that
I have and the software that I have and
how much that costs as well so as you
can see here it all tallies up if you
want to get into the game like I'm
getting into it then it'll cost you
around about 4
hundred dollars that's including the
tripod lighting and a basic lens and a
basic camera though keep in mind though
that you will need a decent memory card
and that's one thing not to skimp on
make sure you get like a 10 or at least
a 15 dollar class 10 memory card so you
can shoot movies without having it cut
out and believe me a cheap memory card
will cut out while you're shooting 1080p
30fps video so that's about it for me
guys if you like this video then don't
forget to chuck it a big like and if you
have any questions or comments about the
gear that I use or about my production
techniques then feel free to drop a
comment in the comment section below and
also feel free to just go back and
re-watch parts of the video and get an
idea of what I use that's if you like my
recording style as well also one thing
that I will point out that I didn't
point out before is that there are some
very valuable sources of information out
there and they generally cost nothing
for instance a lot of the extra little
hints that I learnt from photography
came from a website called Ken Rockwell
comm and it's free it doesn't cost you
anything and the person who makes it I
believe his name is Ken Rockwell how is
just an expert in photography and he
tells you a lot of tips and tricks that
are very useful for beginners so don't
forget to go to that site if you want to
learn a little bit more about recording
and photography as I did and yeah I'm
just pointing and letting you guys know
about that site as it was a very
valuable source of information as it
taught me essentially a lot of the times
it's not just the gear but it's the user
themselves using that gear so learn to
get the best out of your gear and learn
to use it as best you can if that makes
any sense but anyway guys I'm out of
here and if you haven't already
subscribed attack your city where I'll
be coming back to you guys with more
tech news and reviews and I'll catch you
in the next one peace out for now bye
and what we can do here is we can
actually disable
services that we don't need some of
those invasive services</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
