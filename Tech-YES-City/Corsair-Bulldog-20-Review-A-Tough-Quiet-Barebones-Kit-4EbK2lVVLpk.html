at this holy moly
when corset sent out this massive case I
had no idea such a huge package could
hold such vulgar beauty but upon putting
this computer together I was amazed that
not only how small the overall package
was but how damn quiet and fast all the
gear and start performed so let's take a
look at course there's a bare-bones
computer kids that is the bulldog one
bad guys and today we're taking a look
at courses second version of their
bulldog Shaffers the previous one
featured a z170 and that is well out of
date so the one here comes included with
an all-in-one cooler for the CPU a small
form-factor power supply named Li the SF
600 which is really impressive since it
has 58 available on the 12 volt line is
fully modular and is gold rated then
there's the Z 270 Mini ITX motherboard
which is a custom bulldogs brand of Z
274 designed by MSA for Corsair this
sports food influx Wi-Fi and onboard
Intel Nick and a solid vrm for
overclocking four cores for dual cores
but seriously I don't recommend
bothering with VI 370 350 K and on that
note of overclocking I managed to get
the 7700 K I have here two five
gigahertz on this board and the cooler
was quiet as always except the cabbie
Lake CPU itself as you may or may not
know needs to be delivered in all
honesty to achieve better temps that is
a separate topic for another day then
lastly of course there is the case which
comes with sound deadening and support
for a full sized graphics card and is
very easy to build and manage cables
with and all this comes in at 400 USD
there's a big question is it worth the
money
well let's build this thing then run
some 4k benchmarks on it and then also
run a noise test for you guys
you
so there it is the course their bulldog
2.0 it performed extremely well given
how surprisingly small it is and had no
problems allowing the GTX 1080 Seahawk
to breeze and that only managed to reach
them near 60 degrees whilst gaming for
hours on end and this was in a 32 degree
ambient temperature so very impressive
for a graphics card to stay this low in
a case this small the CPU unfortunately
had to be down clocked at 4.8 gigahertz
though this was no fold of the CPU
cooler which actually features 292
millimeter magnetic levitation or fans
that keep it very quiet and very cool
the radiator that is but as you guys
already know the problem on the CPU end
here is rather the thermal paste under
the heat spreader itself and that's
Intel's own folders of 7700 K run so hot
and not Corsairs on this occasion for
building a fork a heavy weight
dominating gaming PC is certainly
possible with the Bulldog dare I say you
could even travel with it since it is
relatively lightweight with the whole
build I have here coming in at eight
point four kilograms and you can also
have it in the living room and it will
look great beside a TV and of course if
you decide to put the hardware in there
then you can have this thing rocking VR
as well I found that the living room
gaming was of course much better on this
particular machine then another
particular machine I have here
on that note however there is a
conveniently located to USB front end a
mic in and also a headphone out jack at
the front on the rear of the case there
is also a further ps2 2 USB 2 an rj45 2
USB 3 and a USB 3.1 C and a ports here
the antennas for the dual Wireless also
come out here as well as the power input
AC jack also inside the case there is
room to fit one 3.5 inch hard disk drive
and one 2.5 inch drive
four three two point five inch drive now
I was provided all these parts as a loan
sample though not to detract away from
the review this case is a pretty solid
offering to someone who wants a
bare-bones kit that is actually good
value for money I mean you get the
Bulldog case cause they're cooler Maglev
fans at Z 270 Mini ITX motherboard and a
gold rated FF 600 power-play or for 400
bucks and it is very sturdy lightweight
and I had absolutely no problem building
in it at all
as the negatives there really were no
objective negatives to be had the whole
bill was really smooth and everything
was able to be built without a hitch and
I didn't even use the instruction manual
so it will be really easy for
first-timers as well to build something
like this so on that note it does come
with a very easy to read instruction
manual and the only thing I could find
or point out is that there really is no
cable management options besides the
included zip ties though since it is a
small form factor case it does make this
point kind of knowledge void and also
the look of the case is of course
subjective though I think it looks
really nice especially in a living room
environment and the venting is actually
pretty good on this particular model
allowing all the hardware to freeze and
allowing those temps to stay pretty low
as for the other parts used in this
build you will have to purchase them
separately meaning the I 770 700 K the
corsair gtx 1080 and also the corsair 15
Bram and Western Digital 3 terabyte
driver using this build are all separate
items that are not included in the
bare-bones package also there are a heap
of software utilities included with this
package so it will make the experience
that much better and also before I get
on out of here this product will be
available in the US but unfortunately
Corsair have no word on when this
product or if it will be released in
Australia and you guys hope you enjoyed
this review if you did then be sure to
hit that like button and let me know in
the comment section below what you think
of the Corsair Bulldog 2.0 I got to
admit I'm kind of surprised as no are
GPS on this thing anyway guys I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon he's
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
