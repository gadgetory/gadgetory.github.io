different gtx 1060 s1 is a standalone
six gigabyte edition that connects up by
a PCIe standard for enthusiasts who want
to build their own computers the one
below that however is an external
enclosure this connects up to either
laptops or desktops via a thunderbolt
connector and it also transfers all the
data and pixels through this connection
as well however when we compare it to
the standalone Edition adding an extra
device driver with the external
enclosure does that affect performance
well today we're going to be testing
this external enclosure with my in Wind
Chopin which is kind of a best-case
scenario because usually you'd connect
it to a laptop with Intel HD graphics to
get better performance and then we're
gonna test that against the gtx 1066
gigabyte edition with my 8700 k clock to
5 gigahertz we're gonna see what the
differences are in the real world but
also besides that december being my
favorite month of the year courtesy of
Galax i'm gonna be giving away this gtx
1066 gigabyte edition link is in the
description below international free
giveaway so check it out but with that
said let's get on with this video
welcome back to tech yes it is brand
coming to you guys today with a video on
two different gtx 1060 solutions and
intel HD graphics the Intel UHD 630
which is the latest graphics processor
on the intel 8th gen coffee lake
solutions now we're gonna be comparing
all these head-to-head i'm gonna be
overclocking and giving you the stock
clock figures of both these 10 60's and
they both feature twelve hundred and
eighty cuda cores and six gigabytes of
vram the external enclosure itself has a
HDMI DVI and DisplayPort out as opposed
to the standalone solution which has two
DVI outs one display in one HDMI out
however let's give you all what you came
to see and that is the benchmark
starting off with Wolfenstein 2 in the
volc√°n benchmark we had 80 average FPS
with the overclocked external enclosure
versus 75 average fps and then moving on
to the external solution or just the
standard gtx 1060 that was getting
around 107 average FPS versus a hundred
and sixteen when it was overclocked the
intel HD graphics solution would just
fail to boot on this benchmark
completely I guess the settings that we
used which was a blend of high eternity
it just couldn't handle these settings
and just refuse to boot so that was
interesting to see and it was a trend
that did continue in a few different
games here moving over to pub G a very
popular multiplayer title we had a
hundred and five average FPS on the
external enclosure when overclocked we
went up to 107 fps
and then comparing that to the external
solution we had one hundred nine hundred
and three respectively keep in mind
there is a bit of variance when it comes
to these benchmarks especially the pub
GM multiplayer benchmarks the Intel HD
graphics that scored around 8 fps it was
a terrible experience you would want to
get something like this external
enclosure if you are gaming on a potato
and then moving over to dota 2 we had
160 1/2 PS vs. 175 when overclocked on
the external enclosure the standalone
solution storing 214 and 232 and these
were on Ultra settings at 1080p and then
the Intel HD graphics refused to boot
yet again though the dota 2 results were
interesting it maybe showed some kind of
bottleneck on the Thunderbolt device
itself as I have tested dota 2 in the
past with the 8400 and it has scored
higher and of course the graphics
solution on the 1060 external being
close to that of the actual standalone
solution it was pretty interesting to
see that these results were favoring the
8700 K quite substantially when it came
to dota 2 so moving over to call the
Duty World War two we had 94 and 96
average FPS and then moving over to the
standalone solution we had 80 and 90
respectively again a multiplayer
benchmark does have a bit of variance
Intel HD graphics refused to boot
yet again with these settings which was
high on Cola duty world war 2 and then
moving on to the last game here destiny
2 with a custom blend of high and low
medium settings I like to plan these
settings it's great smooth frame rates
very good visual experience we saw on
this 121 and 133 average FPS on the
external enclosure comparing that to the
standalone solution the standalone
solution did get a sizeable boost here
155 when overclocked and 141 were not
and then looking at the Intel HD
graphics it did manage to boot this time
however it was a terrible experience
around about 14 average FPS horrid
experience I would not
recommend this to anybody even if you
are on a budget though quickly take a
look at some other figures eleven
thousand twenty two points on fire
strike gravis score when not overclocked
on the external closure 11911
when it was overclocked comparing that
to the standalone solution that scored
thirteen thousand nine hundred and
seventy-six and twelve thousand eight
hundred and forty six and of course the
Intel HD graphics coming in ultra low
they're not Ultra HD gravis ultra low
and that's got well behind so this 3d
mark firestrike graphics core really
does paint the picture of practically
how well these solutions performed
overall in the games and so there was a
bit of a gap between the external
enclosure and the standalone solution
even though they're both the same
graphics cards and even though they
overclocked to similar levels I think I
only got an extra 20 megahertz out of
the external solution and also the
memory did overclock higher on that and
the temperatures weren't bad at all I'll
give you guys a quick look at the
temperatures here 68 degrees and 67
degrees with a custom fan speed of 80%
and then of course the stock settings
for the stock clocks the standalone
solution did very well and this is what
makes Galax cards really good they run
pretty quiet as well even at 80% I'll
let you guys take a listen to the noise
tests
so that's conclusion time and what we're
looking at here is an external enclosure
that will solve a massive problem for a
lot of people out there who have things
like laptops or they have a desktop like
mine the in wind Chopin that is a travel
PC and it does fit inside a backpack
however it can't fit a gravis card so if
I just wanted to use the in wind Chopin
as my main computer and go traveling I
could go traveling with it and then come
home and I would have desktop like
performance so the external enclosure
does solve a really big problem for a
lot of people out there especially if
you have that Thunderbolt connection
although one thing I will point out is
that it does add an extra layer of
device drivers and an extra device and
so this did affect performance in the
benchmarks I don't think this can really
be helped I mean Thunderbolt is quite
efficient it has up to 40 gigabits per
second transferred data rates and of
course if you want to enable this you
just go into the BIOS make sure
thunderbolts enabled by default and then
also after that download the device
drivers from the motherboard
manufacturer then install the nvidia
graphics card drivers and you're all
good to go however another question that
no people are going to have is that I
used an 8400 with the external enclosure
versus the 8700 K and I believe the 8400
is going to be the best real-world
scenario yes it will affect performance
a little bit but I believe that
Thunderbolt device extra layer does
detriment performance quite a bit as I
have tested the 8400 in the past and the
performance differ between that in the
8700 K even with a 1080 TI hasn't been
that much at all though here's where
things get a little bit tricky you
couldn't find it for sale anywhere it's
currently unavailable I don't know how
much it'll actually cost as well Galax
didn't give me a price for this thing
though when it does hit the market I
will update the description below as it
is a really good solution that will
solve a lot of problems for people with
small devices they'll buff that we've
got the GTX 1060 sniper 6 gigabyte
edition which comes in at 299 us from
the Gallic store or if you're in
Australia I can pick this off the 378
Australian and that about wraps up
