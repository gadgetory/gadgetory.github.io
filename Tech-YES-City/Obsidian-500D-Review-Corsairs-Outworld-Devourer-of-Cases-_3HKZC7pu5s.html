refreshed their obsidian lineup of cases
this here beside me is the 500 d which
is a mid-sized tower ATX case aimed at a
single workstation user and/or gamer of
course it comes with the tempered glass
now in 2018 it also comes with doors
that open and close and are attached via
magnets though is this case at 150 US
dollars or $299 worth your money and is
there anything wrong with it
let's find out
welcome back to tech yesterday this is
brian coming to you guys today with a
thorough look at the Obsidian 500 d now
Corsair sent this in for review and I
decided to do a build with it with the
x79 one and motherboard so that's kind
of like a new post gen motherboard but
still for sale on our Lee Express and of
course a little teaser for an upcoming
video I'm gonna be testing this
motherboard and overclocking it in this
case with the corsair 360 mil rad now
with this case itself you get the option
finally to install without any hassles a
corsair 280 mil h 110 i GT or h 115 ir g
be cooler that they recently released i
decided however with the front being so
easy to install a cooler so what you do
is you can take the metal plate out and
then just attach your cooler and then
put the plate back in so you don't have
to actually undo the front panel itself
and you don't even have to take off the
top of the case which also supports a
280 mm rod or a 240 ml rad by doing the
same mechanism you just remove the metal
plate and on that note you've got a
magnetic dust filter on the front panel
and the top of the case which are easily
removable and there's also one on the
bottom of the case also on the bottom of
the case there's four feet that are
pretty thick and very solid so you're
not gonna have a problem with these
falling off even if your rough like me
and you move the case around and bang it
around quite a lot and with the
construction of this case you get an all
steel chassis with the machined alloy
front and top the sides of the panels
are tempered glass and they are quite
thick they come in at 5 mil panels and
with that they close by magnets as I
said before however one thing I will
critique about the opening and closing
of these doors is that I wish they had a
locking mechanism of is if you want to
port this build around or port this case
to your friend's house for example when
you're traveling with it the doors are
gonna open and closed if you move it and
jolt it around which you're most likely
going to do since it is tempered glass
and it is quite heavy so I would like to
see a locking mechanism of some kind
added though if you are gonna do a
building this seriously just take these
panels off straight away don't try like
I did when you look at the build you
like ok I'll maybe just get away with
putting the build in quickly don't do
that just seriously there's a screw on
top of the hinges one screw on each side
take that off you can then easily remove
the panel and then get on with your
build as
the building in the case itself it's
very straightforward at the rear of the
case you've got two 3.5 inch drive bays
which come off easily you can put your
drive in there with no screws that's a
screwless installation and then put
those two 3.5 inch drives back there's
also support for three 2.5 inch SSDs via
their own trays though you will need the
little included screws to screw these
down to the tray itself and then put
that back down as for cable management
there is a bracket that you can take off
then below that is your front panel USB
3 and also external hard drive
connection power and reset buttons and
audio in and out as well but oddly
enough there's no USB 2 front panel
connections which I guess going into a
new age every new motherboard does have
a USB 3 front panel out so if you like
me and you kind of like putting those
older builds in like x58 for example
into a case like this because the new
cases are constantly improving then you
won't have any front panel USB
connections so I would like to see
Corsair maybe on the front panel
implement a hybrid USB 3 USB 2
connection in a future reiteration of
this case they're getting back to the
cable management itself you've got about
40 mil clearance to do your cable
management and I found it so easy to do
cables and run them in this case and
know that there's no RGB controllers
this time around with the Obsidian 500 d
so you've got less clutter from the
get-go as opposed to the 570 X you do
have all those controllers and it does
make cable management a little bit
difficult the 500 d is going for that
clean aesthetic you only get two
included fans so I decided to take the
front fan off and then put a 360 mil rat
in now on that note of temperatures with
tempered glass on both the sides of this
case you're probably thinking the
temperatures are going to suffer quite a
lot and honestly no we're using a 780ti
we're using a 6 core on the X 79
platform which does put out a lot of
heat we're coupling that with a 650 watt
power supply and with the panel's closed
doing a stress test and this is in 32
degree ambient temperatures by the way
we've got a maximum of about 66 degrees
on the CPU 83 degrees on the GPU where
the side panels closed and then with the
side panel open we only got one degree
less 82 on the GPU 65 max on the CPU so
the cooling even with just the 360
Miller out of the
and also the included fan at the back
doing outtakes or push-pull
configuration
I found this case was cooling very well
and keep in mind as I said before this
is a pretty high-powered build as I
believe from memory the 780ti juice is
roughly the same power if not a little
bit more than a 10 atti anyway moving to
the front of the case and moving inside
you've got a lot of room to work with if
you're familiar with the air series
cases the air 540 for example this
reminds me of that a lot of room to
install your fans at the front or the
top of the case and also just a lot of
room to work with in general inside the
case itself it's as if they've copied
that air series design and gone with
that for the Obsidian case itself of
course the big difference being that
power supply shroud which this time
around is fully enclosed itself and can
only be accessed from the rear of the
case I do recommend if you've got a
modular power supply installing your
cables before you fit the power supply
in itself
they're moving further up the top of the
case there's a nice little socket there
to slot your 8 pin CPU cable through
from the rear which is very handy a lot
of the times I have trouble pushing the
CPU 8 pin through on this case it was a
breeze and then moving a little bit down
there is an option there to mount a
vertically mounted GPU if you so wish
you will need the kit to do this I
didn't get this kit sent with this case
so I couldn't vertically mount a GPU of
my own so I just went with the standard
straight sagging GPU with the 780ti and
honestly this case looks really good the
lights will shine through of course you
can see with the glass itself it is
tinted a dark color though your RGB
lighting or any lighting scheme you go
with will shine through really easy of
course the case itself will fingerprint
quite easily especially if you're like
me and you like to use a bit of wd-40 to
give it that final look shine and I must
say though after you do give it that
final look shine and if you're living in
an aesthetic setup then this case will
look phenomenal
so when it all comes down to it is the
Obsidian 500 d worth 150 US or worth 219
Australian dollars and in my opinion yes
it is a premium case comes with 2
included fans and it does an extremely
good job if you've got a push-pull setup
cooling this thing as we saw before the
results one degree difference also the
case itself does provide
some type of noise reduction I'll let
you guys take a quick listen with the
side panel closed versus open
so the temperatures are good the noise
is good and the build quality is good on
the 500d the three main points that you
should look for with the case and this
has it there's also no sharp edges
throughout this case so diabetics will
be home and hosed and also those I
pointed out before some things that I'd
like to see with this case maybe in a
future improvement would be some locking
mechanism on the side panels themselves
be very careful if you are traveling
with this PC or you are moving it around
a lot though if you're doing a one-off
build take the panels off do you build
then put the panels back on and for a
static setup it's gonna be an amazing
case as well with those three magnetic
removable dust filters gonna be very
easy to work with and the final result
is one that is very nice anyway guys
hope you enjoyed today's review of the
Obsidian 500 d if you did then be sure
to hit that like button and let me know
in the comments section below
do you like dark volcanic matter because
I think that's what obsidian stands for
I actually didn't know before I did this
review but I then googled it and found
out what it meant anyway it is a case
that is pretty damn nice I do like this
thing I'm not sure if it will replace
the air series though I do love my air
740 that thing is just amazing of course
this does have a proper magnetic dust
filter that is easily removable at the
front the s7 40 for example man that's
hard to remove that front dust filter
I'm dreading the day that I actually
have to do it now but I'm dreading the
day that I have to do it which should be
now and I'll catch you in another tech
video very soon he's out for now bye
welcome back to tech yeah City this is
brian coming to you guys today
welcome back to there guys will catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out banana buddy dude you
you
and you guys I'll catch you in a used
parts hunt very soon anyway guys hope
you enjoyed it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
