keys are you tired of having your
keyboard not hold the title of
mechanically elite well then you need a
mechanical keyboard right
so which mechanical switch should I get
that's a question I've been getting
asked a lot especially in the last few
months and so I thought I'd make this
video as a guide to give you my informed
opinion on which mechanical switch you
should get that is if you can't go to a
store and try them for yourselves
so before we get into this guide I would
recommend if you can go to a store where
you can try the switches out and see
which one you like the best for yourself
because at the end of the day it's about
you and what switch you need but without
being said let's move on so today I'll
be talking about the advantages and
disadvantages of using reds blues and
browns also quickly talk about blacks
clears and greens so before we get
started I'll talk about the advantages
of using a mechanical switch over a
rubber dome switch and the first
advantage in my opinion is the
consistency of mechanical keys in that
they all have the same amor they all
require the same amount of actuation
force across all keys and that being
said they also have a longer lasting
life time which means that consistency
is going to hold throughout the life of
the keyboard so if you guys have had a
rubber dome keyboard before you'll
probably notice that your enter spacebar
and any keys probably wear out pretty
quickly and so what that means is that
you've got inconsistency across your
keyboard also another advantage of a
mechanical keyboards or all mechanical
keyboards is that they're more
responsive since the actuation point is
halfway down usually in the key press
it's going to actuate faster meaning
faster response times from your keyboard
over a rubber dome keyboard also another
benefit in my opinion especially with
using Blues is that there's less fatigue
on your wrists and your fingers which
could possibly reduce the chances of
having arthritis in the future who knows
right so I found that using Blues or
even using a mechanical switch over
using a rubber dome in my case
completely eliminated a wrist strain and
finger strain as well so anyway let's
get on with the first contender here and
that is the Cherry MX red keys so the
first switch we're going to look at
today is the Cherry MX red switch now I
use this recently for about two weeks
and I found myself coming to the unique
conclusion that
these are the most responsive key
switches ever and I was like wow hook
this up over a ps2 port you'll know what
I mean
so for gaming if you want the fastest
response time ever and you don't care
about toddlers or anything else then
this is this is probably the switch for
you however that being said what will
keep on the advantages though I also
managed to score my fastest typing run
ever but even though I tried so many
different times I managed to get 129
words per minute so it allowed me to get
the fastest typing speed ever although I
did make a lot of typos so the
advantages are is that it's really
responsive it's also allows you to get a
faster typing speed if you have really
precise or accurate hands in my opinion
but let's move on now to the
disadvantages because that's when it
comes in since this is a linear switch
and that is there's no feedback between
you pressing the key and when it bottoms
out it means that you're not going to
precisely know where the actuation point
is since the actuation points around
about halfway down there you're gonna
have to guess when the actuation point
is and so I found myself or I found this
design it requires 45 grams of pressure
by the way to actuate the key I found
myself making a lot of typos like
seriously I've never made so many typos
in my life with typing errors in my life
before I started using a Cherry MX
red keyboard so if you've got rough
hands and I've said it in the past I
consider myself to have rough hands then
you're probably going to make a lot of
typing errors on a cherry MX red
keyboard also I found myself miss keying
and games as well should I you know like
just accidentally pressing it would
actuate so that's something to be
mindful of as well so you're prone to
errors in my opinion on a cherry MX red
keyboard that being said though I also
found because of the linear design also
found myself bottoming out pretty hard
and so this led way to actually slightly
noticeable strain on my fingers and some
slight risk pain as well after using
this for two weeks so I believe it's a
little bit more strenuous on your hands
and your wrists that are blue otherwise
would be so anyway that being said also
the noise the noise was a little bit
less than a blue but is a little bit
more than
Brown in my opinion so anyway let's move
on now to the Cherry MX blues so the
next switch here we're going to talk
about the blues now I'm going to try and
leave my bias out of this as much as
possible because I absolutely love
cherry MX blues but let's listen to the
advantages of this key switch and that
is it's got two levels of tactile
feedback and requires 50 grams of
pressure in order to actuate so with the
feedback thing when the keys actually
clack together that will produce the
noise also there's a bump midway there
on the actual switch so that'll give you
midpoint this really tactile feedback
feel to the keys I'll let you guys hear
it quickly so you can see that it's loud
but it's also extremely comfortable to
type on I'd say this is in my opinion
the most comfortable keyboard to type on
so if you're on the computer for very
long hours then you might want to look
at getting a cherry MX blue with that
being said I noticed that my wrist
strain and finger strain completely went
away with when I started typing on
Cherry MX blues so awesome there right
but let's talk about the disadvantage
what are the disadvantages of using a
cherry MX blue well that is that they're
not as responsive as the Reds so if
you're a hardcore gamer and every
millisecond counts then you might want
to get a read though if you're like me
and you're a gamer that makes typos and
you still want to be competitive and you
want faster response times than a rubber
dome then a blue makes a lot of sense
that they're just not as responsive as
the Reds another disadvantage could be
the noise these are the loudest of all
the any keyboard I've actually heard in
my life so if you need to keep noise
down and you share a room with someone
then you may want to look at getting
another key switch though if you like me
it's a love-hate relationship everyone I
spoke to either loves the noise which MX
blues or they hate it I absolutely love
it because I'm in an isolated room where
I don't have to care too much about
noise and so it's like music to my ears
whenever I type on this thing because
it's so comfortable anyway that's the
disadvantages let's move on now to the
Cherry MX browns so the Cherry MX browns
I got to borrow this keyboard for my
work for a one week and I found myself
thinking of it as not so much a hybrid
but a unique key on it
a lot of people tend to refer to the
Browns as a hybrid being somewhere in
between the Reds and the blues but I
thought they were more of a red in that
they're a linear key so you press it
it's a linear key none of the parts
clack together like the blue but it's
got one little bump there of feedback on
the actuation point and so what this
made me feel with the Browns is that
they were the best for double tapping if
double tapping is a priority for you and
you need a double tap then go get the
Browns because I thought they were the
best double tap is out of any key switch
I've tried in my life that being said as
well also with the Browns
I found typing on them to be a little
bit more comfortable than the Reds
they're still not as comfortable as the
blues so I think that's where the hybrid
thing comes in they're more comfortable
to type on the Reds and they're not as
comfortable as the Blues though they're
a little bit I mean like Abbie's dick
come more responsive than a blue but
they're not as responsive as the red so
I think that's the hybrid thing I think
that's when it gets thrown into the
argument there when people talk about
browns though I will say another
advantage of the Browns is that they
were the least audible in my opinion I
thought they were the quietest of all
three switches so if you need to keep
noise down then Browns are going to be
for you but like the Reds I did notice
my fingers and wrists were getting a
little bit fatigued probably not as much
as the Reds so in my opinion if you're a
hardcore gamer then you might want to
look at the Browns or even the clears
and I'll talk about the clears a little
bit later the less weaker the
disadvantages not as comfortable as the
Blues and again it's that thing I
mentioned before and not as responsive
as the Reds so they're about the only
two disadvantages in my opinion and
again it's in my opinion but anyway
let's move on now to the other three
switches that is the blacks the clears
and the greens and then we'll move on to
the conclusion for you guys
so let's quickly talk about the blacks
they require 60 grams of actuation
pressure in order to actuate and though
unlike the Reds and I mean it's still
our linear switch but unlike the Reds I
thought they are closer when you press
them the closer you got to bottoming out
it felt like it got harder and heavier
so more like an exponentially heavier
switch the closer you got to bottom
that makes any sense the Reds is pretty
much just straight linear but this was a
sort of like yeah if that makes any
sense so the black was a unique feel on
its own and it may be a better switch
for someone who's a gamer I think the
blacks would be more better for gaming
than maybe the Reds in some situations
so an interesting switch nonetheless
let's talk about clears these in my
opinion are a better Brown maybe because
I got larger hands but I found myself
quickly trying out a clear I thought
that they provided more of a tactile
feel than the Browns and I thought they
were more of a true hybrid than the
Browns was I actually found myself this
would be my second best preference if I
was to get something and I couldn't have
the Blues I'd use either clears as my
next-best they were heavier they require
60 grams of actuation pressure in order
to actuate so they're heavier than a
Browns but I felt like with that bump it
made the bump a little bit heavier and I
actually really enjoyed typing on the
clears I thought they were awesome let's
move on now to the greens I thought
these were one word to put it was
ridiculous after typing on these for a
few minutes I was like wow these things
are heavy so I can only recommend the
greens to someone who loves the clicky
clicky feel but has really strong or a
really strong typing force
so in conclusion it depends on you what
type of person are you and I'm going to
make some quick recommendations here and
that is if you've got rough hands then
I'm going to say you would either want a
brown or a blue especially for typing if
you need to keep the noise down then
probably go with a brown if you don't
care about noise and you want the best
type of experience in my opinion then go
with the blue both these will give you a
better gaming experience than a key
rubber dome keyboard would in my opinion
however if you don't care about missed
typos or anything like that and you want
the most responsive keyboard hands down
then maybe go with a red or a black also
you can go with a clear as well if you
like the Browns I do recommend trying to
clear that I absolutely love them the
greens it's up to you but yeah I
probably I'd say the greens would be for
someone
unique and they know what they want
anyway that's that being said one thing
I will talk about is what about razor
greens and essentially a razor green is
a Koh switch it's not a cherry MX switch
and I will say straight away that as
much as I don't agree with them just
blatantly copping another company's
design I will say that it is a damn
impressive copy when I tried the razor
greens at the store man they felt
exactly like a cherry MX blue and now to
razors credit the actuation point was
actually higher on their cherry MX blues
or their unique green switch than it was
on a normal Cheerios blue so it would
indeed be better for gaming so yeah if
you can get I mean Kay light switches
I'm going to say that they're legit
they're I mean they felt really good
they felt exactly like Cherry MX
switches so I'm not going to lie to you
guys so I mean if you can get a
mechanical KLH cherry blue mechanical
college blue then go grab one so cherry
MX key switches K light switches they're
both really good also top ray and other
unique key switches I'll leave that to
another day if you guys want me to just
talk about that then I will but if you
have any questions or comments then
please leave a comment in the comment
section below and I'll get back to you
as soon as again if you like this video
then please give it a thumbs up and I'm
going to say it one more time try the
switches if you can go to the store try
them if you can because the blues when I
tried them years ago I automatically
cling to the blues my gut instinct was
like wow these feel amazing and I'm
still using them to this date and I will
use them for the foreseeable future
anyway so go to the store if you can or
go to a computer store a text or if
you've got one near you and go try them
out that's the best way to decide which
key is right for you though if you
relying on other people's opinions and
opinions like mine then I've tried to
sum up the advantages and disadvantages
of all of them and I've tried to make
some recommendations for you guys as
best as possible so anyway guys I hope
you enjoyed this video I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
