Corsair booth which is at the msy booth
in this arena it's huge
I'm lovin it I am joined by Chris Smith
email from Corsair how you doing brother
yeah pretty good man we got a bunch of
stuff on display today we're at the MS Y
booth we're also at the NVIDIA booth got
some brand new stuff and also a couple
of refreshes of some our old stuff just
like those RGB lights Corsair is
infesting the building yes exactly RGB
all the things as you know what do we go
beyond us here Oh white version of the
Corsair 5 70 X now I just took a look at
the red version on my channel so they're
two new variants of the 570 X hitting
the market yeah yeah exactly so it's a
couple of different ones so you got the
regular black which we've seen on your
channel before many times there's the
red and then there's also the white
that'll be on Steve hardware unbox
channel sometime soon oh did you say so
that's on Steve's channel right yeah
Steve's channel he hasn't done a video
on it yet right ah no yes it Steve get
on it you slacker so now we're over here
with a new product hitting the shelves
from Corsair this is an RGB headphone
stand right yes I came out about a week
ago the st 100 it's about 129 in
Australia it's got RGB two different
zones fully controllable as all Corsair
products are it's got 2 USB 3.0 ports
and a 7.1 surround sound card inside it
wow that's actually not just a headphone
stand how much can we expect this thing
to hit the market for so this one's
about 129 in Australia about 60 to 80
bucks in the US so there you go guys if
you need more bling Corsair have you
covered so here we are with another new
product from Corsair this is the spec
for you
yeah spec go for tempered glass so now
it's got tempered glass yes a bit go for
tempered glass gonna retail for under
100 bucks Aussie about 60 to 70 US came
out yesterday as you can see here we've
packed this one out with a whole bunch
of RGB as we always do but just the case
by itself you can fit any size graphics
card ATX motherboard in there as well
it's got SSD mounting so you can display
them and also three and a half drive
bays - we fit some custom water-cooling
in this thing yeah
should be able to fit a little bit of
custom water-cooling but it's more
designed for all-in-ones alright guys
well with that in mind I will be taking
a look at one of these on the channel
probably in the next month I definitely
want to build with some tempered glass
and that's only on the left-hand side
yeah yes so here we are now with the
last product on display over at the
Corsair booth well this is actually the
Nvidia booth now and this is the Corsair
one but now with a 1080 TI right yeah
exactly as you can see it looks pretty
similar the one that's already being a
new channel when it launched but this
one has a 1080 Ti in it as with the
other one it is also water cooled this
one has a 960 SSD and we've upgraded the
power supply from 400 watts to 500 watts
is about to ask that 400 watt goal
Raider passed by now upgraded to 500
Watts of course to take care of that
extra power consumption from the 1080 TI
now what about some other specs is there
anything else new to this one so this
one's pretty much the same as before
i 770 700 okay this one has a 960 SSD
like I said before the msi micro mini
ITX sorry motherboard in there - and 16
gig which is 2 times 8 of ddr4 vengence
lpx Ram
it's pretty much ready to go for a gamer
of course there's a new coffee like CPU
lineup coming out is there any rumors of
a corsair one perhaps to be released
with a mini ITX z 370 in a coffee like
CPU yeah we've been taking a lot of
suggestions from the public you know
people like you asked about riser now
they're asking about coffee like we're
really committed to supporting the new
CPU architecture but we'll see whether
we're able to release it or not so we
just quickly relocated the noise over
there that was the literally the loudest
guy I have ever heard at an event in
history ok but to finish off this I was
going to say the 1080 Ti it's absolutely
fine if you're just in the gaming 7700 K
is going to be absolutely fine
there's going to be real no big
difference with the coffee lace abused
but of course if you're gonna stream and
do all the things that are intensive
then of course the upgraded coffee light
will be relevant though that's about it
for today's Corsair booth guys
big thanks to Chris for coming out and
helping us out yeah no problem mate and
like I said you know we're considering
new stuff so heat us up when our socials
let us know glorious George is all over
reddit so if you really want to see
something if you really want more RGB
let us say ok guys I'm sure you want
more RGB everywhere I'm looking to get
an odd
B courses sure time waiting for that to
hit the market as well and I'll catch
you guys in another tech video very soon
also if you like the video be sure to
hit that like button let us know in the
comments section below if you would like
Corsair to implement something or update
something and I'll get onto it and I'll
let Chris know or you can let Coos know
directly because he reads the comments
yeah yeah always reading the comments
that's my favorite thing to do thanks
Chris and I'll catch you guys in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
