have a monitor from AOC.
This is the AG322QC4.
It sports: a 32-inch 1800R curvature;
Quad HD, that's 1440p; 144
hertz; AU Optronics VA panel.
It also boasts Freesync
2 support ranging from
30 hertz to 144 hertz.
And within this spec
itself, it supports HDR 400,
the 400 standing for 400 CCD units
of brightness available in control.
So without further ado,
let's take this panel
through all the paces,
ranging from input lag
to response times to see if it is really
a good gaming monitor; and
if so, it can double down
as a photo/video editing monitor.
♪ I wish that I was a madman ♪
♪ But then maybe I live full for you ♪
Welcome back to Tech YES City,
and here it is right here.
Comes in at 540 USD currently.
Or if you're in Australia,
640 Aussie dollars.
So the AUD pricing on
this monitor in PPP terms
compared to the US pricing
is actually better,
technically making this a
better buy in Australia.
Now straight away into
the input lag itself.
We measured this with
a thousand FPS camera
with a red light switching on
a test total system input lag.
This will give us a good
idea of whether this monitor
has inherent input lag itself.
So the best frame we got
here was 10 milliseconds,
the worst frame 22 milliseconds,
averaging out to 16.8
milliseconds of total input lag
through the system.
So the input lag is
phenomenal on this monitor.
This is with the input lag
option itself set too low on,
which I'm positive any gamer themselves
will want to leave this feature on.
So if I had to guesstimate
an input like figure
for this monitor directly, it would have
under 10 milliseconds,
making it really good.
However, since this monitor
does have a VA panel,
we have to check out the response times,
which are very important at 144 hertz.
Since every frame is
transitioning at around
seven milliseconds,
we'd want response times
either at this seven milliseconds or under
for lthe best viewing experience.
And so this got four
different overdrive settings:
off, weak, medium and strong.
On the medium setting,
we were getting around
seven to eight milliseconds
of response times in CS:GO.
Changing over to the strongest setting,
we're getting around six
to seven milliseconds,
meaning it was just
coming under the threshold
of being acceptable for
a decent gaming monitor
at this resolution and 144 hertz.
However, moving on with other settings
important to this monitor
is the brightness.
Since it is rated a 400 CCD,
we did test this out
with the i1Display Pro.
And the best square that
we measured was 379.
So it is coming a little
bit under that rating,
but the white uniformity on
this model was very good,
with the worst case scenario
from the center being 5%.
So very well uniform all round.
Doing a crosshatch test
with an orange background,
I did notice a smidgen of
crosshatching at 144 hertz.
However, from a normal viewing
distance of 80 centimeters,
this won't be a problem at all.
Moving on to the backlight bleed itself,
it was phenomenal in that there was really
no noticeable backlight bleed,
even on a pure black
background with my camera
going all the way up to 400,000 ISO.
So so far for gaming,
this is a good monitor.
But what about out-of-the-box settings
for photo and color accuracy?
Say you wanna use this as
not just a gaming monitor
but something to edit videos too.
Well, using the i1Display Pro
measuring the out-of-the-box profile,
it was pretty off in
pretty much every spectrum
from low to high key, as well
as the colors themselves.
Changing this to the SRGB mode as well
was a little bit better, but
it still wasn't accurate.
So if you were getting this monitor
for photo or video editing,
I wouldn't suggest it.
Unless of course you do
wanna calibrate it yourself.
However, upon pulling this
monitor out of the box,
I will start to talk
about the build quality
and feature set, and this
monitor is exceptional
in this regard.
It's got a very thin bezel,
pretty much a frameless design,
as well as the stand
being very high quality.
And it has a tilt,
height and swivel adjust
on the horizontal plane.
Vertical, it doesn't
have swivel adjust there
so that's the one thing.
If you wanna mount this vertically,
then you will need a different stand.
However, it does have
support for VESA mounting,
and there was no croaking
when I was moving
this monitor around.
It was very firm and had
a tight build quality.
Moving through the OSD, I think AOC
have absolutely nailed this.
You get a D-pad on the
bottom where you can easily
go through all the different settings.
And speaking of the settings themselves,
it's very in depth, gives you full control
of things like shadows.
And it's also got an interesting
feature called game color,
which if you wanna give that
saturated unrealistic look,
which I personally love when
it comes to enjoying games,
then you can change this up from 10
on the default setting up to 20.
I found 15 looked very good,
especially when I was
playing Battlefield 5.
The colors really came out.
So great setting to have in his monitor.
Moving through other features,
you've got full RGB control.
You've got blue light control as well
if you wish to lower the
blue light at nighttime;
as well as having different
game modes built-in,
ranging from RTS to FPS,
to custom game modes, which
you can then save for yourself.
Though on the OSD itself,
you also get the ability
to control the LED lighting,
which is on the bottom
in two different zones; and on the rear,
with four different zones.
But they all come to the same color,
ranging from either the
choice of red, green or blue.
And you can control the intensity of that.
Moving through the inputs
and outputs, you get SVGA,
as well as two HDMI ins
and two DisplayPort ins,
supporting up to DisplayPort 1.2.
There's also a USB and data hub,
as well as an additional port
for the included controller itself,
which you can then control pretty much
all the settings you could control
through the D-pad itself, just
externally via the commander.
Also included with the
monitor is two speakers,
which are mounted in the rear of the unit.
And the sound itself could
be described simply as muddy.
I personally wouldn't
be buying this monitor
for the included speakers,
but will get voice out of it
if you just wanna use it
for Skype conversations.
Though if you are looking
for some decent sound,
definitely look at picking up
some separate speakers or headphones.
On to the last big
setting with this monitor
and printed on the box, the HDR.
Moving through the YouTube demos,
just like any other monitor
I've had come through here
under a thousand dollars this year,
it does look good on
those YouTube HDR demos.
Definitely better than
the default settings.
But when it came to games,
I do much prefer leaving HDR off.
The colors seemed to be washed out,
just like the Windows desktop.
And personally on this monitor,
I much prefer just using
the default setting
with the color mode set to 15.
Anyway, if you survived until here,
it is now conclusion
time with the AG322QC4.
And what do I personally think of it?
Well, I think it's a gaming monitor,
and so if you're looking for
something for color accuracy,
I'd go elsewhere.
But if you want a very
enjoyable monitor for gaming,
has 144 hertz, it has
decent response times
with the strong overdrive settings,
six to seven milliseconds;
it has very low input lag,
as well as having great viewing angles,
then this monitor is
definitely worth a look.
Comes in at 540 US; or
in Australia, 640 AUD.
And honestly, for gaming,
it is a really nice monitor.
I really do like the
implementation of the OSD as well
in that you can get that
more immersive experience,
especially if you're playing RTS
by simply hitting the game colors up
and getting that nice saturated look.
As well as having those extra features
for competitive gamers
too like shadow control,
FPS display on the monitor itself,
which you can put in
four different corners,
and having a manual crosshair
overlay on the monitor itself,
which I don't think is actually
allowed in competitive play.
But anyway, this monitor
does pack a big punch,
and I hope you enjoyed today's review.
If you did, then be sure
to hit that like button,
and let us know in the
comment section below
what you think of the
AOC Agon 32-inch monitor
here on the desk.
Love reading your thoughts
and opinions as always,
and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon.
Peace out for now, bye.
