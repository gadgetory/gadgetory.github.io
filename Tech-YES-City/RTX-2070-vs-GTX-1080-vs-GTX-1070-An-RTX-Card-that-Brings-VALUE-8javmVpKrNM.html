a GTX 1070 or you're possibly waiting
for an Archie X 2070 to magically drop
down from the heavens
Yussef that's your cue to drop a RT X
2070 out of frame so it looks like it's
dropping down from the heavens
so the RT X 2070 is finally released
into the wild and it's actually the
first r-tx card that I like in terms of
dare I say value for money when we look
at what you can buy one for at the
moment you can get one for currently
five hundred and thirty US dollars or in
a straight eight hundred and thirty AUD
and at this price point it does post
some decent figures I'll pull up some
synthetics for you guys at the moment so
you can see how it performs against the
other cards in the stacks then you may
be thinking of purchasing in terms of
value for money you see here it's
beating out of ten eighty comfortably
it's also beating out the ten seventy by
a longshot
however it does of course still fall
behind the GTX ten atti
now this card itself the gigabyte RT x
27 TAC edition I did manage to overclock
this thing about 80 megahertz on the
core and about 400 megahertz on the
memory this did translate into gains not
just in these synthetics but also in the
games too but it does come at a cost of
increased power consumption and the next
synthetic we're gonna pull up for you
guys it's time spy extreme here the RT X
2006 cards do pull ahead of the GTX 10
series cards especially in relation to
the fire strike scores and the
overclocks do give the GTX 2070 a bit
more of an advantage and of course when
you overclock the 20 series cards you do
gain more performance but if you do
overclock the GTX 10 series cards as
well then you will gain performance on
those cards but of course when it comes
to overclocking your mileage may vary
with that aside let's take a look at
some gaming benchmarks and then get on
with the conclusion with the RT X 27
welcome back to take your City on this
test bench here today we're using a 78
20 X clock to four point five gigahertz
coupled with 3200 megahertz
CL 14 timings memory and the first few
benchmarks I'm going to pull up for you
guys is destiny - at 1080p and what we
can see in this benchmark is the our TX
2070 is comfortably pulling ahead of the
GTX 1080 and also the GTX 770 but still
falling behind the 1080 TI 1080p is a
little bit more CPU bound and I decided
to test 1080p and also 1440p ultra
settings because I believe this is where
the 2070 sweet spot is going to lie but
looking over the 1440p numbers they do
see a little bit of an advantage to the
turn atti in relation to the 2070
of course the 27 t is still powering
along compared to those other 10 series
non TI variants and then moving on to
the next title Crysis 3 of course even
in 2018 there's still that question that
goes around can it run Crysis and in
this particular game at 1080p and 1440p
in particular at max settings that's
very high on all the dials yes it can
and it did so very well surprised to see
the 2000 series cards doing a little bit
better in relation to the other games
when we look at the numbers we can see
here it's comfortably pulling ahead of
the GTX 1080 and also the gtx 1070 still
falling behind the 1080 TI of course but
still starting to weigh up in terms of
the 27 t being the at least so far the
king of the 2000 series line up at least
in terms of value for money but pulling
up some further numbers for you guys far
cry 5 here at 1080p were actually
cpu-bound
a lot of the time so the results didn't
vary a whole lot and then we move up to
1440p we then see the 1080 TI start to
pull ahead of the 2070 and also the 2070
gaining a comfortable lead yet again
over those 10 series cards next up here
we've got players unknowns battlegrounds
a game that is on its way out I believe
an eternity P the r-tx 2017 also the
1080 and 1080 TI are near maxing out
because of the CPU so the CPU is the
limiting factor again at 1080p here the
GTX 1070 was falling a little bit behind
moving up to 1440p though we then start
to see a difference between these three
cards but it was surprising to see that
the 2070 was a lot closer than 1080 TI
than it was to the GTX 10
and I believe this has to do with some
kind of optimizations that are happening
for the r-tx 2006 cards in relation to
pub G I'm not quite sure if I pull up
some numbers from a previous review we
can see that the 2080 as well was
comfortably beating a 1080 TI in this
particular game and I've also updated to
the latest drivers so the 2000 series
has had a little bit of time to mature
since the last time I review the 2080
however if you like World of Warcraft
and the bad news is this game does need
very high single core performance and
we're showing here that I have to
literally max this game out with a 200
render resolution scale just to get the
graphics cards to be stressed near 100%
and even here we are hitting a few cpu
limitations I believe going even higher
may stress these cards more but again
here we're getting over 40 fps with the
1080 Ti even if we drop it down to 1440p
were still getting around these numbers
because the game starts to be CPU bound
but we can see the 2070 is still pulling
ahead of the 1080 and 1070 in this
particular benchmark that 1% lows are
showing this as well and then moving
across to scum we're testing here at
high settings this actually performed
pretty well in this benchmark pulling
ahead of the 1080 and also the 1070
that's still falling behind the 1080 Ti
I actually couldn't test 1440p for some
reason because I was testing on a 1080p
monitor and to get the 1440p numbers I
was using the NVIDIA DSR settings which
does enable a higher resolution but in
this case it didn't work properly in
only this particular game I didn't
really understand what was going on
there maybe it's a bug who knows and
then a lost of the gaming benchmarks is
the Final Fantasy 15 demo you've got
this in two flavors you can either set
it in the default mode with no DL SS
enabled or also set it with DL SS
enabled and what we saw here on the
normal mode the r-tx 27 he was pulling
out of the 1080 and also the 1070 but
it's still falling behind the 1080 TI by
quite a bit when we enabled ELSS mode
the RTS 2070 does pull ahead but it does
sort the expense in my opinion of this
game looking a little bit worse than the
normal benchmark that we're used to so
DL SS is a feature that is promised on
the RT X 2006 as well as ray-tracing
but as I've said in the previous 2000
series cards reviews that I've done
we're yet to see these properly
implemented in any game and on top of
that is their game going to be enjoyable
and is it going to be mass adopted and
not some show pony game like ashes of
the singularity now moving on with some
other numbers in particular for this
card the power consumption with the RT X
2070
I'd imagine would be normally a little
bit lower than this but because the
gigabyte model is overclocked out of the
factory it was pulling numbers that are
higher than the 1080 and also the 1070
when we overclocked it we again
increased power consumption by a little
bit - this was power that was derived
from the wall and that's where we
measured it in all four cases here
moving over to the thermals the noise
and also the temperatures gigabytes
cooling solution right here is a dual
slot cooler this time around if we
compare it to their 20 atti for example
even their 2080 they used what's a two
and a half slot cooler on those models
so it is thicker and it does weigh more
than the 20 70 20 70 coming in around
850 grams as opposed to the 20 80 TI and
the 20 80 which come in over one
kilogram but nonetheless it does use
less power and it doesn't need such a
big cooling solution it's got 382 mil
fans which do an absolutely fine job of
cooling this thing and keeping the noise
low so we can see here we've got a
hundred percent eighty percent sixty
percent and also the auto fan speech
which we're a little bit higher I must
admit than the twenty eighty when I did
that review but the noise was very well
under control I'd say 60% on the fan
speeds is the sweet spot for this card
which kept the temperatures very low at
a comfortable 66 degrees which for me
personally I do like keeping my graphics
card under 70 degrees so this cooler is
definitely capable of giving you quiet
noise as well as giving you low
temperatures and of course decent
overclocks as we talked about before but
also with this kardama ticular have got
an RGB logo on the side here that lights
up with a gigabyte logo you can change
this by a software if you wish to on the
rear of the card you've also got three
display ports and one HDMI and you've
also got USB type-c if you wish to use
that in conjunction with other devices
or VR for example so there are all these
ladies gentlemen for the RT X 2006 cards
from gigabyte these are a gunmetal
and black aesthetic it does look in my
opinion a lot better than their 10
series counterparts for the same
gigabyte models they are including as
well a four year warranty on these cards
at least in Australia very aggressive
very good if you're looking for
something you can put in your computer
set and forget and have peace of mind
knowing that it's gonna last you a long
time and of course what about the r-tx
2070 when we compare at verse the GTX
1080 and also the gtx 1070 and even at
1080i
in terms of value for money there's a
reason why I put these 310 series cards
in this graph because I believe they are
the closest competitors to the 2070 and
what we saw here was pretty good value
for money coming out of this card it's
also got those new features if they do
get implemented and how and when they do
get implemented I have no idea just yet
because what we're kind of seeing is
just demos and promises at the moment
but they do have the ray-tracing cores
on board they do have the support for DL
SS which I'm sure when it's released it
will be pretty good and you will be able
to benefit from the value that the 2070
brings at least we've been waiting two
years for it so it's not impressive by
any means but it still is better I have
filled in a 1080 at straight retail
price and even a 1070 so it is coming in
at a decent price point especially when
we look at the 2080 which is nearly $300
more and it's not giving you a whole lot
more performance at the same time you
still get those new ray-tracing features
and as we said before DL SS support so
it's good to see that there is kind of a
value orientated option for the RT X
2006 out there if you're looking to
upgrade to this series then this is a
decent choice and that's about it for
