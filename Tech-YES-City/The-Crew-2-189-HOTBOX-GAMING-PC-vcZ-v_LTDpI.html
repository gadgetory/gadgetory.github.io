I've done a dedicated budget PC for a
dedicated video game and recently on PC
the crew 2 has been released now minimum
spec requirements state that you need an
i-5 2400 s and a gtx 660 or greater and
what we've got here on the desk is
something that's a previous generation
to the i5 2400 however it is going to be
a Xeon X 34 40 and you can overclock
these higher and they will perform
better than I for 2400 so hopefully the
CPU will do well in this game but also
for the gravis card we've got here a
deal on a GTX 780 we picked this up for
a hundred and twenty Australian dollars
which would equal 88 USD and then for
the other deals here they're very
different so this was a direct deal I
only got this part for the money some of
these other deals I have to pro rather
them because something else that's going
on here on the channel is that I'm going
out getting these crazy deals that get
so many different parts for a set amount
of money this right here was a case
cooler and power supply that actually
picked up in a two PC deal that I've got
for a hundred Ozzie dollars however I'm
just picking out these three components
from that deal and I'm pricing it up
around 30 AUD or 22 US dollars now right
here in the middle is a motherboard SSD
a gigabytes of RAM and an i5 750 we got
this in a massive deal that I picked up
for 700 Aussie which included for our x4
70s also a massive p3 case three
different motherboard different CPUs
over 40 gigabytes of ddr3 memory but
this here I'm going to be pricing this
up at 80 Aussie dollars or 58 USD so
this brings the whole total before we
add in the x34 40 to 169 u.s. dollars
but since the x34 40 costs 20 US dollars
from Aliexpress we're gonna throw that
on top and make it 189 US dollars for
this budget build around about 255 ozzie
though there is just one problem with
all these components and that is that
they're a little bit dirty so we're
gonna give them some check yes lovin and
then we're gonna run the
welcome back to take S&amp;amp;E we've got right
here the palace blade the motherboard
and the memory and the i5 750 all set up
because I want to see if they boot up
before we put it into the build
especially the power splaying
motherboard they're real pain to pull
out if everything's set up and then you
find out something's faulty so we're
just gonna pretest this make sure it
works and then if we're all good to go
then we're gonna save a lot of time
we're gonna know that our whole system
works but another thing as well as
someone has decided to do cable
management with electrical tape usually
you use this first for covering up
soldered joints but it looks really bad
and tacky so we're gonna take that apart
so as far as we're gonna go with taking
all this tape off whoever put it on
really went to lengths to make sure it
wasn't really coming off and of course
using a stanley knife is actually risky
as well because we could end up cutting
the Y's too so we'll try and just
utilize that they will see how it looks
in the build because we have unsheathed
most of most of these ends as well which
he kind of need especially on this end
for the flexibility though now we're
also getting a signal out of it so that
is really good news it's time to give
this thing attack yes cleanse so we just
pause mid yes cleanse here and we've got
first time here trying a toothbrush and
I found this one I was cleaning up the
studio I was like I always intended to
use one of these but this was the
perfect scenario where we had this
little grit on just really weird places
and a bit of wd-40 combined with the
toothbrush really made this thing stand
out and look like new so this will be
another tool in the inventory when it
comes to a yes cleanse
so it's now the next day and this CPU is
actually doesn't work anymore it's dead
and the sad thing is it was working
yesterday I had an overclocked to 4
gigahertz in this computer and
everything was going absolutely fine and
then it just died and this is the second
time this has happened and I'm not
really going to talk say anything more
because I don't want to tarnish any
brand names and what I think it is is I
do need to gather more research but what
we've got in here at the moment
hi-five 750 we've gone back to the four
core four threaded CPU and it's now four
gigahertz but the problem is its
throttling so we've to take this apart
we're gonna deal it it and we are gonna
put some GC extreme on both the die and
the core and see if that fixes the
problem and we're now at four gigahertz
and we're peaking out at around 70
degrees so it's much better than before
we were actually throttling so that's a
huge difference and we're doing it on
that real budget cooler as well
so we just finished playing the crew -
on the hotbox and it was as expected the
Z on X 34:44 cause eight threads would
have been perfect unfortunately guys you
have to pay your respects in the
comments by pressing F because the four
core four threaded I 5 750 and 4
gigahertz is being stressed on all those
calls at a hundred percent and the
graphics card still got a little bit of
headroom so it would have been a perfect
combination gtx 780 however for the crew
to at 1080p high settings is a perfect
gravis card for this game but with that
said how does it play pub G with the
latest update let's head on over
then we have it in the background pub G
pop G that's what we were playing 1080p
high settings and we're getting over
60fps pretty much all times on this game
now unlike the crew to where the CPU was
more strain than GPU Tom G at 1080p high
settings was actually straining the GTX
780 more than it was the CPU so the i5
750 of 4 gigahertz was absolutely fine
in combination with this graphics card
so that's about it nice little combo of
course as I said before I would prefer
having that 4 core 8 threaded CPU at 4
gigahertz I thought that would have been
a better balance but sometimes it does
happen and here today we just came into
some bad luck something that's
unexpected that happened I will try and
gather more evidence but if you know
anyone who's had a deal it'd and it's
worked and then suddenly it stopped
working then let me know in the comment
section below tell them to send me an
email so I can sort of investigate it a
little bit more and with that said I
hope you guys enjoyed today's budget
build all the parts as I said in the
intro they came out really cheap this
was under 200 us even with that failed
CPU on top and it came in just a little
bit over 250 Aussie dollars so honestly
the crew 2 was almost half the cost of
this PC and that's just the game so if
you're into free-to-play games something
like this in the background would
represent phenomenal value for money and
that's what it's all about when you
build use price performance you pick up
those dirty old undepreciated parts you
give them some tech yes lovin and then
they come out looking really good and
also performing really well too I was
actually pretty surprised that little
cooler master cooler as well managed to
keep this thing at 4 gigahertz but keep
in mind when we did D lid
we went from throttling to then 70
degrees which I was really impressed
with the temperatures after we did that
so I can recommend doing it just be very
careful which thermal pace you use I'm
probably gonna stick to GC extreme both
under the IHS and above it when we match
the cooler to the IHS because it does
give out some phenomenal numbers and I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
did then be sure to hit that like button
if you have any questions about the PC
parts featured in today's video then be
sure to drop a comma in the comments
section below I'll get back to you as
soon as I can but
you guys know these are usually one-time
deals I can't replicate these deals and
sometimes you're like man how did you
get a GTX 780 for like 90 US dollars
that's just hustling that's part of the
game I'll put some links in description
below if you want to search on eBay but
you're generally not going to get as
good as a deal as someone that just
wants to quickly offload the parts for
some cash with that said I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
