weekend maybe even get a haircut not
like I need one or anything with Maya
you found tool here the ESD data vac
blower and I was getting inundated with
requests to take a look at this x79 WAN
and motherboard off Aliexpress you guys
are spamming me on Twitter Facebook
messages in the comment sections on my
videos so I knew I had to get this video
out straight away it got pushed to the
top of the queue now you can get this
board for around about a hundred and ten
dollars off I'll Express standalone and
it'll support x79 Zeon's and that's the
good thing about these Zeon's especially
with the e5 1650 is that it supports
ddr3 registered that's the difference
between this and the 3930k similar CPUs
similar performance exactly the same
performance at the same clocks but you
do get that support for that ddr3
registered now ddr3 register memory is
very cheap especially compared to your
normal ddr3 and your overpriced ddr4
memory that's what's starting to make
this kit look appealing as well as the
fact that you can get it from a whole
kit which is what I did for around about
three hundred thirty dollars you get the
e five sixteen fifty sixteen gigabytes
of memory and this motherboard shipped
to your door and the good thing about it
is the Aliexpress sellers will even mark
it down for you without you asking so if
you've got very strict custom laws and
you're beginning this thing in without
paying too much import taxes though your
mileage may vary so be careful on that
so what we've got here is if you want to
- I'll mention quickly you can go out
and pick up the individual parts for
probably cheaper I managed to pull up
some eBay listings CPU is around about a
hundred bucks motherboards 110 could get
some memory for 60 bucks so you can save
yourself around about sixty US dollars
if you bought the parts individually of
course if you live in places like the US
Australia for example you can go out and
buy a Rison five sixteen hundred comes
with a cooler this doesn't come with a
cooler by the way you can get 16
gigabytes of ddr4 memory 170 bucks and a
be 350 motherboard for $90 that brings
that total to four hundred and fifty
dollars that's brand-new that comes with
warranty this generally doesn't come
with warranty it'll only come with what
the Aliexpress guarantees are which I
think is like three months
but no it was all that aside let's take
a look at the overclocking the ins and
outs the flaws and the good things about
this I'll Express motherboard
welcome back to tech SC this is brand
coming to you guys today with that video
on the one and motherboard's now this is
the only x79 one a motherboard I've had
comes through here I haven't had an x58
motherboard come through this is the
only one I've had to come through but
I'm guessing the formula is gonna be
similar all across the board the first
thing I noticed is that they're using a
h77 chipset on this motherboard somehow
they managed to get quad channel memory
working which is a good thing because
quad channel memory is going to make
this platform more relevant especially
compared to dual channel it makes the
speeds and the bandwidth similar to that
of for instance dual channel ddr3 200
megahertz at 1600 megahertz quad channel
ddr3 that's one of the benefits of it
but how they push that through h77
chipset I got no idea and the reason
they go with that h77 chipset is twofold
first of all the license is a lot
cheaper than an x79 chipset license the
second thing is the h77 chipset license
of course is not overclockable and
that's running a benefit for the people
making these motherboards because they
aren't putting the best vrm on them that
means that they can get away with saving
money on the license and also capping
the overclocks and that's one thing
about this board it will cap the 1650 to
3.9 gigahertz that's what I found I went
into the boss it reminded me of a server
blast you did have the options there to
change some settings on the memory you
could force that up to 1866 but again
that depends on the kit of memory you
get I managed to get my memory to 1600
megahertz across four sticks
this is unregistered memory which is
pretty good the performance was really
good in games and I will say this
straight away if you're looking for a
gaming machine on a budget and you live
in a remote area and things are
overpriced where you are this will serve
you well for a decent gaming build
performance an overwatch was very smooth
performance in Vulcan Wolfenstein 2 was
very smooth as well I did notice the
clock speeds in Wolfenstein were going
down depending on the CPU load and same
with overwatch 2 but let's get on with
the biggest point that I'm going to
stress if you want to buy this thing and
that is the vrm temperatures they were
incredibly hot and this is its stock
settings - if you're getting this thing
please do me a favor and put a
on that vrm heatsink when I didn't have
a fan on it even at the stock settings
out of the box I was getting over a
hundred degrees from the readings when I
put the overclocks on and put a fan on
it now I know it's a little bit of a
weird situation I had but it's just a
quick fix put a 20-centimeter fan on it
and the temperatures dropped around 40
degrees on the heatsink I think and 20
degrees on the vrm and this was
overclocked stock settings was even a
little bit better so I was now I'd be to
get my CPU to 3.9 gigahertz but I also
did it with keeping the VM a lot cooler
so if you want to keep this thing for a
couple of years which I'm guessing you
will want to keep it for a couple of
years if you're buying a combo like this
then please do get a 12 into
12-centimeter fan just silicon it over
that heatsink get something worked out
because you will want some vrm cooling
on this motherboard anyway onto another
question what about the Russian custom
bias is going around putting them on one
of these will you be able to extract
more overclock 4.2 gigahertz for example
and the answer in my case was I couldn't
get it to work no matter what I did I
downloaded the Russian boss for it tried
flashing it with alpha dose it would
just freeze every time I tried different
versions of alpha dose just froze every
time so I couldn't get a custom BIOS on
this thing and I'm guessing that's why
they've made this reiteration of this
motherboard because they don't want
people overclocking these motherboards
they're just simply in my opinion not
really capable of high overclocks and if
they do get these motherboards in if
people do get these motherboards in and
overclock them and they break them and
it's still under the Aliexpress warranty
the seller generally will have to bear
the brunt so I'm guessing that was the
big request to lock these bosses out now
you may be able to get it out with a
custom boss flashing tool manually and
flash it but that's a lot of work and
I'm guessing the average guy out there
who just wants to get one of these kids
it's not gonna be able to do it I do
have this custom tool I just haven't
learned I haven't spent much time with
it at the moment to learn how to work it
it but anyway there it is BRM make sure
you get a fan over the heatsink also
with your CPU you are limited to a 3.9
Giga it's overclocked on the e5 1650 and
I believe this will scale even though
I've only got only
one and motherboard here I believe this
is going to be the trend throughout all
the wine on motherboards they're not the
best motherboards they are we made with
budget in mind and also the sellers do
want to make a profit and that's
understandable so you're going to
generally see a trend across x58 boards
as well where you're going to be limited
in your overclocking with these
motherboards I would guess that the best
combos would probably be those fixed
Zeon's with no overclocking they are
really good value and they will couple
well with these motherboards but anyone
and motherboard after seeing what I saw
here with the vrm I'd be putting a fan
on it regardless of the model so now for
the temperature chest I did do over half
an hour even up to an hour on most my
stress tests changing things around and
the maxed pool I could get was 125 watts
now on the bass it is rated up to 130
watts and on this particular bus I can't
change that no matter what so they've
definitely custom set this BIOS to limit
those overclocks not only on the
multiplier itself but also on the power
distribution so if you do get unlucky
and you do get a bad deal on an e5 1650
you may not even be able to get to 3.9
Giga it's I'm just not sure because the
voltage does go up to one point two
eight volts on the core and you can't
change that no matter what you do so
you're overclocking options are limited
but at 3.9 gigahertz with a fan on the
heatsink it does run really well so for
the Cinebench scores you're getting
around about 990 points that's the most
I can get with the overclock 23.92 it's
out of the box will be around 880 so it
is decent performance and it will play
today's games very well the sandy
bridges are still very relevant in 2018
especially if you're coupling it with
mid-range graphics cards in this case I
had a 780ti which is a very good used
graphics card if you want a couple of
with something like this you'll have an
excellent combo for gaming also other
things with this motherboard you get two
SATA cables included the faceplate and I
will say that these are some of these
shortest SATA cables I've seen in my
life also if you are tuning this thing
make sure you turn off USB selectively
suspend in the power options I noticed
when it turns off the USB ports and then
you get
turn them back on again you get this
very weird stuttering problem it's
something that's really annoying also
when I was transferring files I don't
know if it was that USB Selective
setting I believe it was but the files
were coming to a pause as well so really
turn that setting off may even want to
turn off the PCIe power link setting as
well just make sure that's off to get
smooth performance though one cool thing
for those guys who love retro and retro
noises when you boot this thing up it
makes this real 1980s computer sound so
it's I like it I personally think it's a
cool thing I'll let you guys take a
quick listen
but it could be a double-edged sword and
the reason I say is is in the past I
have you know had a girl who you know
it's just they hate you playing video
games and so you know you wake up at
midnight do a little sneak jump on the
computer you know headphones on
everything try to be a ninja
but if you've got this noise there is
buddy buddy bleep she's gonna hear that
and she's gonna wake up and go off at
you so that is the double-edged sword
with this motherboard and that noise I'm
not even sure if you can turn it off in
the BIOS I haven't really checked that
because I'd actually like it in my
current situation so though before I get
on out of here quick recap with the x79
one and motherboard and the kit that I
got at least 16 gigabytes quad-channel
pumped memory 516 50 goes up to 3.9
gigahertz motherboard that does support
both of these though you will want to
put a fan on that heatsink own and I
keep stressing that there are some
positives there are some negatives to it
you will need to get your own CPU cooler
as well so make sure you do that when
you get this I do recommend the VT g5 if
you're in a remote area great value for
money
of course there's being good value for
money if you're in a remote area may
want to consider going out and buying
new if you're in a country like the US
or the UK just weigh up your options
though it is a solid option for what it
is if you're getting into PC gaming does
have nvme to support as well does have a
USB front out header and the sellers
they will mark it down for you and they
do pre test it as well to make sure
everything's working so there are the
benefits the negatives as well I pointed
them out through all doubt the video so
there it all is I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and if you did them assure to
slap that like button if you have any
requests then be sure to drop a Co in
the comment section below and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can and you
probably noticed all these graphics
cards on the table here I will be making
that you used graphics card guide for
2018 in this current crypto currency of
poeple apocalypse a popular pop player
that anyway I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
bye
obviously you're getting a Cinebench
score of around about a thousand point
getting a Cinebench score of up around
it you're getting a Cinebench score of
around about a thousand points you're
getting a Cinebench score that goes up
to around about a thousand points so you
are getting a little bit of extra
mileage there so let's the start of my
weekend and I wanted to relax a little
bit and maybe even get a haircut no not
an aide one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
