popping up about Nvidia going to
announce their new graphics
architectures and that's right I say
architectures because apparently there's
going to be one dedicated towards
cryptocurrency miners named cheering and
there's going to be another dedicated
towards gaming graphics cards and peer
so today we're going to talk about both
these architectures and we'll start with
cheering who's named after a famous
mathematician Alan Turing and what I
believe you'll get with these mining
cards is something that'll be twelve
nanometer based and they'll be based
similar to Volta but of course a lot of
the features will be scaled down and
these will be dedicated towards things
like if theory and mining and also Zen
and Zi cash mining with sold based
hashing so what you can expect here is
something that will have DisplayPort
reduction and also be highly optimized
for mining itself very efficient and in
that it will have to be more efficient
than the current gaming graphics cards
otherwise
- quite simply won't want to buy them
however if they are going to twelve
nanometer from 16 nanometer this will
make them more efficient just from the
fabrication process itself and not only
that if they can do tweaks via driver
level and hardware level then you could
indeed see massive demand from the
mining segment for these new graphics
cards however keep in mind before we go
on with this video I will say everything
is just my opinion and rumors that are
floating out there at the moment nothing
is really set in stone but apparently
both these architectures will be
announced sometime in late March or even
mid-april
anyway cheering looks like it will be a
solution for minors and certainly there
will be increased pressure from the
market itself not just from angry gamers
who want to buy a graphics card but also
from the industry itself think about
this if companies like Coursera fractal
design Intel AMD can't sell their
components especially when it comes to a
CPU for example then there's going to be
pressure from those guys too Nvidia to
say hey get some graphics cards out for
gamers so we can sell all the rest of
the components involved in building a PC
so don't worry guys when I say this this
shortage of gaming graphics cards won't
be for very long there will be pressure
from the whole market itself to get
gamers graphics cards and so the
solution they've got here I believe is
going to be an peel and it won't be your
typical massive performance increase
that we used to sing I believe what
we'll get with the twenty series or
eleven series it depends on what they're
gonna name it I believe we'll get
something that's 14 nanometer based and
my evidence of what my thinking spans
from is the fact that we've already got
the Quadro P 1000 and something that no
one really talked about yet and was
something that I noticed personally when
I was tinkering with a mini ITX PC I
noticed that this graphics card the
Quadro had the same amount of CUDA
causes of GTX 1050 yet the biggest key
difference was that it was 14 nanometer
base over 16 nanometer which is your
current 10 series Pascal cards so the 14
nanometer card was more power efficient
too so this made it a perfect candidate
or will make it a perfect candidate
coupled with GDD are six memory for the
upcoming gaming gravis cards from Nvidia
now keep in mind this is all speculation
from me but honestly don't think we're
gonna see huge performance gains where
we got rumors circulating that a 2070
for example will be the 1080 Ti I just
don't think you'll see that but what I
think you'll see is say a good 10%
increase but also the fact that gamers
can now buy something specific but add
features disabled at Birth a software
and hardware level so minors can't go
out and buy this graphics card and use
it for mining so this seems like the
most logical approach if I had to look
at it from a business perspective from
Nvidia but also from the whole market
itself how
can you make a win-win-win this is how I
believe in video could do it now of
course there's gonna be gamers out there
who are like well I bought my GT X 1080
nearly two years ago I want to upgrade
and of course in video will service that
market just you won't get your typical
3035 percent increase that you're used
to back in the past and another big
reason for this in my opinion is the
competition from AMD or should I say
lack of competition gamers were waiting
for Vega for a very long time and when
it hit the market later than expected it
still couldn't compete with Nvidia's top
dog that was the gtx 1080 TI so now
there's really no pressure from nvidia
to deliver massive performance gains and
as a matter of fact and no this is not
just a rumor if nvidia and you've seen
this in the past with intel if their
technology is too far ahead of the
competitors then they will be fine for
anti-competitive practices so I don't
think in videos in a spot to really
deliver something that'll just kick the
pants out of their current tense series
the pressure is not there from AMD but
we've also seen evidence of a 14
nanometer card already out in the wild
with the p1000 anyway guys I hope you
enjoyed today's video if you did then be
sure to hit that like button and let me
know in the comments section below what
you think is gonna happen in the next
few months or even later in 2018 love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always and before I get on out of here I
will say take everything in this video
with a grain of salt it's just me doing
my research and then presenting a video
to you guys I don't have any inside
information I don't know anything that
will happen in 2018 as concrete it's
just how I've looked at the market and
made sort of like a logical based
decision on what's most likely to happen
anyway
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
