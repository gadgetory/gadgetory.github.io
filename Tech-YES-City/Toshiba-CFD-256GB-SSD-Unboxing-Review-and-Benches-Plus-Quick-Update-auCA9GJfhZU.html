baronies you coming back to you guys
today with an unboxing and review of the
toshiba cfd 256 gigabyte SSD now this is
a JDM product I believe so this has just
been released in japan and as such i
wanted to get a new SSD and i was
thinking about getting the samsung probe
because i need you i was like oh why do
you need it you've already got an SSD
why do you need a new SSD well i got
this specifically because i needed extra
space and also needed faster write
speeds specifically because i was
recording a i'm starting to record as
you guys know i record a lot of videos
in camtasia studio and my actual
solid-state disk drive now won't record
1080p raw so this will this will
definitely should be able to and that's
the reason for buying also i wanted to
use my old 128 gigabyte for my hard
drive for work so i got two computers i
want to work and one here and i'm going
to use that one to be a portable little
SSD now as you can see here's the
product it comes with a three-year
warranty so it's not as good the
warranty on the pro samsung pro and
it'll be specifically comparing this to
the samsung pro because it is pretty
much a contender it's around the same
price this was about twenty dollars
cheaper than the samsung pro and the
reason why I got this over the pro was
because it's cfd and I've already got
rammed from cfd and I really like the
brand it's really good value for money
and so I'm going to see if this is good
as good value for money as the ram was
and pacifically the 3-year warranty is
not as good as the Prime going to say
that now the five year warranty on the
samsung pro is better and i probably i
mean i'm going to see how the speeds
hold up but hopefully I'm expecting a
lot out of this hard drive but as you
can see here it's made of metal so it's
cased in a nice metal casing here it
really gives a quality feel to the
product even though it's a real small
lightweight product and as you can see
here with the bum boxing here it comes
with an adapter plate as well for a 3.5
inch drive so you can slide that in plug
it into this and then slide it in and
will fit perfectly in your hard drive
bay suit is good i like it it comes with
the adapter it comes with screws as well
so that's going to save you any hassles
if you you know some some old cases
don't have support for ssds so it's a
really good feature to throw that in and
now the box is just the box comes
reasonably well packaged i do like the
metal casing that's the one
do like I'm not going to be pulling this
apart due to reasons I don't I don't
want to void my warranty so I want to be
actually using this for a good three
years you know if I pull it off and it
fails then that's going to be two
hundred dollars down the drain if it
fails yes so there it is so that's the
box let's go into you guys probably
wondering that speed so I'm going to do
some tests they're going to install this
do some tests as a secondary drive
because that's what a lot of people do
test when they test these they test them
not as the main OS drives they test them
as an off drive they just plug it into
their motherboards do the tests and this
is exactly what I'm to do so I'm going
to run a sssd and crystal disk benchmark
any others to test and then when
comparing two typical samsung 840 pro
two on 56 gigabyte benchmarks and we'll
see how this thing holds up so this is a
JDM product I don't know if it'll be
sold in the states or the UK Australia
but I'm pretty sure I mean some of the
safety products i do see around that
this is good mugen anyway let's get on
to the test let that do the speaking
okay so the first result here is a
program called d and this is a
really good program basically just does
a heap of tests and it gives you guys an
overall score and as you can see on the
right here I got this drive from write
speeds and as you see there the write
speeds aren't that impressive the 4k
read and write speeds are almost the
same as my corsair force 3 which is a
little bit annoying the sequential
writes are really fast but as you guys a
lot of you guys know the sequential
writes like they're not the be-all and
end-all so I'm a bit disappointed about
that let's move on to this samsung and
i'll show you guys some results here
okay so this is the samsung pro and this
is just a result i pulled off someone on
the japanese price website thing it was
just a random score it was basically all
the results that people got on the score
was similar to this one as you can see
here the write speeds are just huge on
the samsung so the samsung 840 pro 256
gigabyte is a beast of an SSD and so
that mean this program is one of the
many programs but i like it because it's
so simple and it just gives you guys
realistic results and it obviously just
gives you a score that you can generally
go by I mean the scores obviously
there's going to be some other programs
that are way more like you know they're
going to give you way more results and
may more in-depth things into the SS
is but I like a sssd because it just
gives you an even easy score that you
can look at and say okay this is this
this is generally how good the SSD is
but let's move on to crystal disk mark
now which is another benchmark and as
you can see here my CFD 256 gigabyte
again did pretty similar to these
schools in d I mean on the 4k
reading rights they wanted that
impressive and this is the 4k reading
rights are really important because they
I mean in a lot of the tests that were
done on a and tech and Tom like all
these SSD places the 4k reading rights
compromise like ninety percent of the
usage of an SSD so that being said
they're so important but they don't get
enough weight in these benchmarks I
think so if you can see here the Samsung
destroys it in these and the 4k read and
write so that's an important thing to
notice the sequential reading rats are
pretty important I mean pretty that's
the same but they're not that important
so let's move on to the Samsung now in
this tests and see how much see what it
did compared to this one and as you guys
can see here the Samsung just
whitewashes the cfd I mean the 4k red
rice a huge I mean look at the guy he's
already putting data on his SSD as well
I think he's been using this as a main
OS drive or something but you can see
twelve percent is already using data on
this drive and so the samsung 840 pro is
just huge so that's what i'm just
getting out here i think these samsung
SSD 840 pro is a better buy especially
even if it's only another ten twenty
dollars it's definitely worth it so i
may have made the wrong decision I don't
know but anyway let's get on to the
final closing and I'll guys I'll show
you quickly my force three as well as
the main OS strap and as you guys can
see here did really got a really bad
score in a SSD but the thing to notice
was that the 4k read and rights were
actually pretty decent I mean the
sequential reading rights weren't that
good as well as the 4k 264 threaded
scores but the yeah the 4k trading
rights was so we're pretty damn
impressive and this is the thing this is
why a lot of people say all SSDs feel
the same kind of thing is that's because
the 4k read and writes there's no
substantial difference like you know the
samsung 840 pro is not like five times
or four times faster than this one
it's only that the best two times faster
this is why a lot of people say in SSDs
like they all feel the same that's
because the 4k reading rights which
compromise like a lot of the score a lot
of the usage of an SSD so he goes I'll
go on to the conclusion okay so in
closing guys I will say that the samsung
840 pro 256 gigabyte is huge that thing
just destroys anything on the market at
the moment I think the vector as well as
a pretty damn good choice as well but
that in Japan that thing is just
overpriced so the eight the 256 gogi
about a 40 pro was like another twenty
dollars and I think it is definitely
worth the extra money so this thing is
just a new product so I think it's a bit
overpriced at the moment I think it
should be about twenty dollars cheaper
than it actually is maybe forty dollars
cheaper than samsung pro the right
speeds were a little bit disappointing
since i got up specifically for the
right speeds but that's not to worry i
mean it does what i needed to do does
recording 1080p raw which is great and
that's what i got it for so I'm really
happy about that and it's also going to
replace my corsair force three and so
I'm going to use my force 3-4 a little
mobile computer that can plug into work
and it's really good so that's a good
option there and i will say that yeah
the three year warranty on this thing is
not that impressive i think it should
come with a five-year warranty
especially since the competitors are
offering like plaxton on the m5 p and
the Samsung are offering five years on
theirs and that's pretty huge so five
years is really good it was in closing I
will say I hope you enjoyed this SSD
review it's not well I mean you don't
get really get to see these JDM products
that much and so I love giving it to you
as well so I hope you guys enjoyed it
please give it a thumbs up if you did
and if you haven't read subscribe to
take your city and i also i will say
that i'm going to take a break until has
well because i just got a lot of my
plate IRL like I'm really busy but I
will get a tech talk done about monitors
so a lot of people are asking me about
monitors and i want to i'm going to do a
tactical monitors also keyboards and
mouses sort of all in one give you guys
some great recommendations from my
personal experiences with all these
types of panels what i've seen at the
stores i've got an IPS panel at home
here I've got a TN panel at home here
I've got all these panels at home I've
seen a lot of panels get friends with
all these panels have got a lot of them
at work as well as extreme amount of
panels at my work so
i can give you guys some great
recommendations and best value for money
kind of thing so yeah that'll i look
forward to giving you as that and i will
do that probably next week or in the
next two weeks and then i'm going to be
having a little bit of a break until
haswell so that's that and i will get
some sick Sundays up as well because
