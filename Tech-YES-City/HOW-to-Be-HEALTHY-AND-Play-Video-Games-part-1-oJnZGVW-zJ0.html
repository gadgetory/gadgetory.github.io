health did you know that one in four
children in Australia are overweight and
when we look at adults two out of every
three adults are overweight over a few
months ago I detailed that I go to the
gym I take pride in keeping my health up
and what do you guys wanted to take a
look into how the yes-man keeps up his
daily regimen of working so many hours
every day but also still managing to go
to the gym still managing to eat okay
and still managing to keep everything in
check so this is going to be a
three-part series on how you can be a
healthy geek in 2005 20% of Australian
adults were obese they predicted back
then that this number would balloon out
to 29% and sure enough here we are in
2018 with nearly 30 percent of
Australians being obese so today ladies
and gentlemen even though it's 1:00 a.m.
in the morning I am going to go to the
gym because I've been working all day
been cutting videos but I still have to
keep up my energy still have to keep up
my health so this is part one the
workout regime let's go down to the gym
and I'll show you what exercises I do
and how you can implement even the basic
ones if your time strapped time-poor to
make sure you're getting that good
exercise in your life
so it's now 11 a.m. in the morning and
what happened was last night I went to
the gym really late I couldn't record
there unfortunately because they're
blasting music really loud to the point
where there'd be no voice work coming
out and so I got home I caught a video
and then I went to bed at 5 a.m. I woke
up it's now 11 a.m. and this is the life
of a youtuber but the one point I'm
gonna make is that I only got six hours
sleep yet I feel really good and this is
because when you do cardiovascular
exercise it helps you sleep more
efficiently if you're gonna go to the
gym or you're only gonna do one exercise
you've only got time for that then
ladies and gentlemen do me a favor
please do cardiovascular exercise they
recommend three times a week 20 minutes
I'd recommend if you can every single
day
me personally I always do 15 to 20
minutes cardiovascular after every
exercise and I know there's some
professional bodybuilders out there that
are gonna disagree with me maybe but
this is not a video for professional
bodybuilders this is just a video on how
I do things personally how I keep up my
exercise how I keep up managing and more
importantly how I keep up my game
so cardiovascular aside what else can we
do in our weekly schedule well if you're
sitting in front of a computer there's
also three more important exercises in
my opinion that you should be doing at
the very minimum the first of it is chin
ups so chin ups will end up working out
your shoulders your spine also your
elbows and your forearms and then we can
quickly turn that around and also
combine some pull-ups into this mix this
will work out the buys
let you crank up a little bit and also
make it look good on top of a feeling
good now I generally do two sets of each
the first set being 20 and then the
subsequent three sets being three each
and then I alternate them between
workouts now the next exercise is very
important if you don't have a whole lot
of time but you're in front of a
computer all day
that is wrists because you're in front
of a computer you're more susceptible to
getting a thing called RSI which is a
repetitive strain injury and this
essentially can cause you a lot of pain
a lot of ache well you should be doing
at the gym
is I personally get a 10 kilogram weight
which I can hold with both hands and
then I end up exercising my wrists I do
this about 35 times one way and then I
change to the other direction and do it
about 25 times and then I do three sets
of the first set and then two sets of
the subsequent set but after this you
should also feel the burn in your farms
because it doesn't just work out your
wrist it works out your forearms as well
another bonus I throw on top of the
wrist is I grab 2 2 kilogram weights and
then I twirl them to left and right kind
of like you're at a rave party and
you're trying to show everyone your LED
lights this will actually if you haven't
done it in a long time
or if you use a computer too much this
should really hurt at first for me
personally now it doesn't hurt one bit
when I'm on a computer as well I can
type really fast my wrists give me no
problems whatsoever I do two sets of
these for 25 seconds ago so now you've
got cardio chin ups pull ups and also
your wrists under control what else do
you need to do ladies and gentlemen well
I do recommend the last crucial exercise
and that is simply sit-ups if you just
get a nice little soft mat if you're
like me and you go to the gym in jeans
sometimes you can then just quickly take
your belt off because that'll start
digging into your back and then you can
just do sit-ups I like to do 34 at a
time and then I mix in two sets of shin
raises so one set of sit-ups
one set of shin raises one set of
sit-ups one set of shin raises and then
the final set of sit-ups so that is all
areas to it ladies and gentlemen with
the crucial workout if you were doing
this every week at least three times a
week in your workout then you should
feel a lot better you should be sleeping
more efficiently you should have more
energy during the day but not only that
you should be thinking more clearly and
this is going to tie in with the other
two parts of this series as well now
before going on with some of the extra
exercises I'm gonna throw in this video
I will say one thing if if time is a
limiting factor and I'm sure it's going
to be a limiting factor for a lot of
people out there try and think of it
this way if you're going to exercise at
least doing cardio three times a week
for 20 minutes that's only an hour out
of your week at the bare minimum and
that's going to help you sleep more
efficiently so then you're therefore
going to save time you're getting a deep
six hours sleep as
pose to a sloppy eight and that's the
time already saved every single day is
you're gonna be sleeping more
efficiently so you have to get to the
gym have to keep up your energy and it's
going to make you feel better
in the long run anyhow if you find
yourself going to the gym and you find
you've got a little bit of extra time on
your hands here's the next set of
exercises you can do my gym I go to is
24 hours a day and they've got so many
different machines for working out so
many different exercises so of course a
lot of people out there want to make
that upper torso look pretty good they
want to pump the buys a little bit want
to pump the chest a little bit
so the first machine I like to go to now
usually when I do an upper chest workout
is the lateral machine that works out
your lats I do three sets with 16 reps
each at 50 kilos after this I like to
then move on to the horizontal
benchpress where I do 34 reps at 45
kilos each don't ask me why I do these
reps and I also do these amount of sets
this is just what I feel good with and
also more importantly when it comes to
the gym guys don't push yourselves too
hard especially if you're just getting
into it I definitely take your time and
ease into a workout that you're
comfortable with and honestly don't
listen to other people when it comes to
working out I'm just giving you the
guide on how I do things personally but
let's move on now to the next machine
that I use and that is resistance so now
with this resistance machine I do a
thing called reverse curls I also do
them at two sets at 24 reps each on the
first set I'll have my wrists facing
downwards on the second set I'll have my
wrists facing upwards so it's a
different workout for your triceps in
both cases so in total here we're doing
4 sets but 2 sets of each way and we're
doing this at 45 kilo though I don't
think this is actually 45 kilo I think
it's 45 pounds I think maybe my gym has
just mislabeled the weights in this case
then the next exercise I'd like to throw
in here is for shoulders because if you
don't have strong shoulders then there's
not a lot you'll be doing in terms of
other exercises and so what we do here
is a pulldown extension this is really
good it'll work out your shoulders but
also your forearms and also your biceps
and triceps pretty much your whole arm
in the process I do two sets of these as
well at 16 reps each at 45 kilos after
the initial four sets on my triceps and
then if I still got energy I'll head
over to the shoulder press machine and
conduct two sets with 24 reps each at 36
kilo then the last exercise we're gonna
go to is I guess the Holy Grail when
people think of the gym and that is your
biceps here there are so many different
exercises you can do or at least so many
different machines and tools you can use
to work out your biceps here I like to
use a variety of equipment so every few
days I'll change up what equipment I'm
using to work out my biceps but at the
gym today we're going to be using the W
shaped barbell this is really good
gives your biceps a nice crunch nice
workout we're using twenty two point
five kilograms on this Bell itself plus
you got the bar and so I'll be doing 24
reps three sets and you really want to
make sure when you're doing these
exercises don't push too much weight
sure you can do a few reps at much
higher weights but you risk ripping
tendons and you do not want to do this
because it's going to put you out of
action for a while it can also cause you
damage in the long run so I do stress
this only lift weights that you're
comfortable with and you've got control
over if you don't have control
especially when you lift things up and
you're really struggling to let it go
down that means the weights too heavy
for you so just drop it down don't worry
if there's guys at the gym that are
massive
don't worry about those guys you're only
gonna be worried about you and how you
feel and how you should work out and so
the last exercise I'm doing here to
throw into my buys is just the bicep
curl machine and I just do 24 reps at 36
kilos and I do 3 sets on each arm you
can also make it a little bit lighter as
you go along because you really want to
feel a burn in your biceps that means
you're working out things really well
and at the end of this workout you
should feel really good you should still
have energy hopefully but if you're just
getting into the gym you may feel tired
halfway through you may feel tired at
any different time so just ease your way
into a workout don't go full-on I've
been going to the gym for 3 years
now and I don't think I'm gonna be
stopping because it just really makes me
feel good it really helps me with my
energy levels and it really helps me
stay focused and the biggest take out of
today's video is please guys definitely
integrate some exercise in your everyday
life even just the simple 4 exercises
that I showed at the start will help you
a lot now of course if you want to gain
some muscle and look really good then me
personally I do recommend if you're
throwing in cardio and your time
strapped always thrown in at the end of
the workout
I don't do cardio before I start my
workout I just do 15 to 20 minutes after
every workout and I feel great I still
get the benefits of cardio but at the
same time I'm not losing too much mass
anyway in terms of my stature and weight
I'm currently weighing in at 74
kilograms I'm 5 foot 10 inches and
that's about it for today's health video
guys with the exercise and in terms of
pre-workout supplements and other
supplements I take I don't take anything
specifically for the gym if I do feel
like I'm a little bit hungry and I want
to eat after I go to the gym because I
do agree with a lot of people that say
you should be eating a nice protein
packed meal after you go to the gym then
before the gym I'll actually eat potato
chips just no home brand potato chips
from the supermarket they give me a nice
burst of energy and I really find they
help my workout every person you go to
will have different recommendations on
supplements like creatine and take
protein and all this stuff before
workouts me personally I just do it all
natural and I just eat some potato chips
if I need a pick-me-up before my workout
anyway guys I hope you enjoyed the tech
health city part 1 video make sure you
stay tuned for part 2 and 3 because
things are gonna definitely be getting a
lot more interesting but in ways I know
they all just tie together to make sure
that you're living the best quality life
