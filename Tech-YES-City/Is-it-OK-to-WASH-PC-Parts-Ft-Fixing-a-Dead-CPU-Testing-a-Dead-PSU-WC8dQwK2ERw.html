power supplies is there any way of
testing and fixing these things let's
find out ladies and gentlemen welcome
back to tech yes City today I've got
some of those crazy experiments coming
back at you and the first one is the
stick of memory that I spray-painted
sometime last year now I just finally
got around to taking stripping the paint
off and then putting it back in the
system and testing whether it works
again so let's get onto that experiment
okay so here's the moment of truth with
the one gigabyte stick let's do this
yeah so that's a memory problem
so the RAM is not being recognized so if
we're working one gigabyte ddr3 stick in
as we can see here we've got seven
gigabytes of ddr3 memory because it's
working alongside another six gigabytes
of ddr3 memory and we're going to put in
the paintbrush now fully cleansed Ram
stick and see if it still works
I mean how tough is that I mean I've got
seven gigabytes of ddr3 memory guys I'm
running lucky serpents place you'll be
unique on the internet no one will be
able to copy you
anyway let's check if this bad boy works
okay system info motion seven gigabytes
of ddr3 memory whoa okay whoa I'll stick
Lou has come back well we're dead
well so what we're going to do now is
we're going to try one more test with
this one gigabyte of ddr3 memory stick
we're gonna wash it with water and soap
and see if it still works okay so here
we go we're going to start putting some
soap on and this is probably the part
where you guys are watching this video
and going what the actual am i watching
so don't worry guys it's all in the name
of enthusiast tech you know when you
came to tech es city you knew what you
were getting into brother
you knew oh you knew so here we go we're
going to scrub this down give it a good
cleanse
and then we're gonna see and I'm gonna
wash it the course
gotta I don't know man you can give this
a hot wash a cold wash whatever you want
to give this ddr3 memory stick your
flavor let's give that a nice good wash
there and we will start hair drain it
you know put a hairdryer on it and get
it all dry so we can quickly get the
excess water off with some tissues and
then we're going to drive
so the moment of truth is upon us we are
going to now test this nice fresh and so
clean can be a stick of memory after it
has been under the tap and also bundled
with some soap detergent and a brush so
and under a hairdryer too so just how
much of a beating can some PC parts take
I don't know this whole little bad boy
has been through hell and back I mean
he's been under paint 7 I didn't even
know how many different coats of paint I
put on that and then he's been cleaned
with water he still works ladies and
gentlemen he still works so 7 gigabytes
of ddr3 memory is being confirmed here
so the stick is recognized again and
that is some wicked news it means you
can wash PC parts but so the next
experiment we've got going on here is a
dead CPU specifically a dead CPU with
resistors that have crumbled off the
back of the CPU now in my case this did
not work at all I had a circuit writer
and I did a pretty careful job of
connecting this circuits back up however
when I installed it again
there was just no signal whatsoever so
in the case of the dead CPU I'd
recommend maybe getting some original
resistors that aren't broken and trying
that if you can but keep in mind that a
warped die is pretty much impossible to
bring back to life so the next
experiment we've got up here is a dead
power supply and without further ado
let's get onto this experiment ok so
testing and dead power supply and seeing
whether it's truly dead or not comes
down to actually testing it itself now
when I turn that on the fan quickly spun
up however you can see now if I try to
turn the motherboard on now there's just
nothing happening so essentially this
power supply is damaged somewhat
somewhere internally I don't know it
looks like a short since it just
actually got something a little out to
the fan and it just doesn't work so
that's how you actually truly test the
dead power supply not is actually by
plugging it up to and cheap components
if you can so it's always good to keep
something like a
and a motherboard around your house just
to check power supplies that would be
something I would suggest because
testing a power play like this on a
cheap motherboard and opinion and one
gig grams of sticks and a GT whatever
this is I've got nothing to lose here
really so this power supply is bricked
and we can chuck that in the bin so the
fourth and final experiment is can you
use a PCI Express port to power your
hard drives let's find out so on this
next experiment we've got a power supply
which has no molex or solder connectors
on it so I'm going to try and use a PCIe
2 PC a female and then a PC a - molex to
molex to molex female and then a molex
to a SATA connector and see if that
powers on the hard drive because I want
to be able to actually make use of this
power supply in a real-world scenario so
if this kind of works then we should see
success so let's boot up the computer so
what happened there John trusty file
there we go
and we're going to see if it boots up
and then we're going to go into the BIOS
and check if the hard drives in there
okay so we're in a set up now and our
trusty little hard drive is not being
recognized right so just going to try up
a DVD DVD ROM or a DVD random DVD writer
whatever now not getting recognized so I
guess it's soldered to whatever it is
side of the side of the side of the side
of the molex just doesn't work so there
we have it guys all the experiments and
the biggest one that surprised me was
this stick of memory here this little
one gigabyte stick of ddr3 memory it
survived some really harsh conditions I
actually left it outside for a couple of
days as well when I was using the parts
cleaner on it to strip the paint and it
still survived it survived a brush soap
washing hairdryer and still works so
I'm pretty surprised and I guess the
verdict on that is is that you can wash
PC parts just be very careful to make
sure that there's no charges left in any
of the capacitors or anything like that
so the next experiment we had was the
CPUs and in general if your CPUs have
been warped from either too much heat
and or too much voltage and they usually
go hand-in-hand
then your CPU will no longer work just
keep in mind though the CPUs do have
sensors on them and thermal protections
however they don't always oh they are
always a perfect safe fail just keep
that in mind because the sensors aren't
located all across the die and it only
takes one micro part of that chip to
overheat and warp and you've got a dead
CPU and this applies to GPUs as well
then we have the power supply experiment
and as you can see this power play
wasn't working and the easiest way to
test for that was to use a test
motherboard and CPU and one stick of
memory now the cheapest way to have a
test set up would really go to pick up
one of those old Pentium 4 systems then
you can get for like 5 bucks and use
that as a tester maybe of one of your
friends or leave it in your friend's
garage or whatever just for testing
power supplies as you can see in this
case it did let out a bit of power when
it first started up but it didn't power
on the computer at all so that's the
definite way to test for faulty power
supplies then the last experiment I had
for you guys was the PCI Express port
from a power supply powering hard drives
and that just didn't work flat out no
power going to either the hard drive or
the actual DVD drive that I tried now
the good news that came out of that was
that the hard drive or the DVD drive
they both didn't fry they both still
worked when I plugged them up to my
other computer and now for the final
last experiment and this is how to
discharge your power supply so there if
you turned off your power supply and you
want to clean it and you want to make
sure that there's absolutely no power
left in that power supply and you can do
the tackiest city method and that is put
on an insulated glove and get yourself a
file with a plastic handle and let's
just make sure those connections are
letting off no electric discharge at all
so anyway that's all for today folks if
you like this video then you know what
to do hit that like button and also
subscribe if you haven't already for
more
technique of using whatnot and I'll
catch you in the next one pace out now
