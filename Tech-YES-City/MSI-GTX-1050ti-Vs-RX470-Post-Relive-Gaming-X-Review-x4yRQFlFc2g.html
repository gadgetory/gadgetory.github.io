of vram it goes pretty hard and it is a
great mid-range 1080p gaming card but
the question still remains
just how far does the MSI GTX 1080 TI
gaming x-craft card go well let's find
out
welcome back to tech city this brand
coming to you guys today with an
in-depth look of msi gtx 1050 TI gaming
x graphics card and of course i'll run
those benchmarks straight away for you
guys
no score
yeah
Oh God
yes
so the performance is really damn good
on MSI's gaming X grav scale which
boosts really hard from the get-go
ironically enough however I have another
MSI gaming graphics card here and it is
this same story low temps low noise high
/ clocks out of the box and that isn't
even with me touching anything or
installing any additional software this
is what makes the gaming ax a really
nice card and sets it out from the
others it also looks really clean and on
this particular model it has the twin
freezer cooler with dual tox fans and
also features red LEDs on the bottom
that glow and on the side there is also
the MSI logo that lights off both can be
controlled via the MSI gaming app
looking at the inputs and outputs of
this card it has a display port HDMI 2.0
and DVI dual out they can support up to
4k resolutions and can be used to record
shadowed play game footage to the card
internally also supports UVic dual end
channel MOSFETs with high side being
rated at 51 amps and the low side being
rated at 117 amps at 25 degrees Celsius
there is also MSI's SFC chokes and also
solid state capacitors the manual over
clocks on this card were pretty good as
well I managed to get roughly an extra
hundred megahertz on the core and also
250 megahertz on the memory with this
guide featuring no way to unlock the
voltage control unless you manually
flash a BIOS on there and with a custom
fan profile on the card it reached only
51 degrees in a 28 degree ambient
environment on load very impressive and
here's a quick noise test at these
settings also another note on that the
fans do spin down on idle so the gtx
1050 TI gaming X it comes in at the
entry level segment but it does pack a
big punch it is a tad behind the RX 470
but at the same time it is a 75 watt TDP
card and comes in with 764 Pascal CUDA
cores and on this edition has 4
gigabytes of vram which is perfect for
1080p high settings gaming in my opinion
though this model does sport an extra 6
pin connecter though it still does
derive mostess power from the PCIe
connection now under pricing the gaming
s can currently be had for around about
180
USDF Amazon and if you're in Australia
can be had for around about 230
Australian dollars surprised in
comparison to the US the AUD version is
actually cheaper in relative terms and
there's also only 30 Australian dollars
more expensive than the cheapest ten
fifty ta model available also although
it is a bit more expensive than even
msas own 140 dollars standard
overclocked edition in the US that model
only comes with one fan and may run
slightly hotter and make more noise and
of course you have the rx4 70s coming in
at around the same price as this model
and gtx 1060 coming in at around the
$200 price point too so it isn't a real
tough market at around 180 USD though it
does sport some solid overclocks and it
does have really nice cooling and
cosmetics and probably the biggest
advantage is that it is a tight dual
slight card so will fit in a lot of mini
ITX cases while still providing a low
thermal package and being quiet very
quiet there was with anything in life
you always pay a premium for the good
stuff and this is certainly the good
stuff anyways that's about it for me
today if you liked this video then be
sure to hit that like button and let me
know in the comment section below what
do you think of MSI gaming X GT x 1050 t
I would love to hear your thoughts and
opinions as always and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye just how far does the GTX
1080 Ti from MSM below what do you think
of MSI gaming XG DX</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
