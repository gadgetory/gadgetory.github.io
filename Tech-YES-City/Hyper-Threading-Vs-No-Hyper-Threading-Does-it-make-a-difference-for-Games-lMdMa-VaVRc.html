the question of can turning
hyper-threading off help with your
gameplay experience on the PC let's take
a look
welcome back to techy our city ladies
and gentlemen this is brian coming back
to you guys today with a video on pretty
much hyper-threading versus no
hyper-threading in a few different
scenarios on my 5820k now in the bus I
do have the option of turning
hyper-threading off and also limiting
the amount of calls that can be used and
so with this I decided to test dual core
versus dual core for threads and then
for cores with four threads versus four
cores with eight threads and then
finally adding in my 5820k running on
six cores and twelve threads though I
will say before we get on with this
results is that it is a little bit
different to comparing a Pentium versus
an i3 for example as in all scenarios
that is 15 megabytes of level 3 cache on
board there so anyway that without
further ado let's get on with the
benchmarks so the first benchmark we are
going to look at is skyrim on 1440p this
is the ultra preset and looking at the
results here are all five of these
scenarios where you've even got the dual
core two threads played absolutely fine
with the frame rates going through the
roof there I mean the minimum was a
hundred and eight on the dual core so
that's something to note if you're on
120 Hertz and you really anal-retentive
but besides that the i3 I mean the i3
here for example the simulated i3 did go
over 122 frames per second on the
minimum so that's something to keep note
about and so pretty much on any five of
these scenarios you're going to have a
great gaming experience if you're
playing Skyrim at 1440p on a gtx 970 so
let's take a look at ARMA 3 at 1440p
custom ultra settings and now this is a
really interesting benchmark to look at
especially when we compare it to the
previous benchmark where we had the i3
in Skyrim beating the dual core two
threads by quite a bit but this time
around it's not the case the dual core
four threads perform pretty much
identical to the dual core dual thread
and in this case I'm going to say when I
tested these both these scenarios there
was no big different like there was no
massive stuttering and I'm going to say
this for the all the benchmarks I did
there was no massive stuttering on any
of these games when I disabled hyper
threading and turn it on there was no
and difference worth noting in any of
these scenarios but for what it's worth
we can see here when we step it up to
fork all four threads versus fork or
eight threads there again wasn't much of
a difference though it is important to
note that the minimum who did score the
highest minimum on ARMA 3 with the four
core four threads and that was even
better than the twelve sorry twelve
thread six core result so for what it's
worth ARMA 3 it does love the cause it
doesn't really like hyper threading but
let's move on now to the next game so
now we're going to take a look at Crysis
3 at 1080p custom ultra now I wanted to
run this at 1080p over 1440 because when
I ran it at 1440p it just becomes so
graphically intensive on my GPU that
even my 970 overclocked to 1600
megahertz takes a serious pounding and
this is at custom ultra settings I
usually turn maybe one or two really
intensive settings off just to get a
really nice framerate there as we see
here the there wasn't much of a
difference at all and I'm actually
really surprised with how well the dual
core performed because I remember when
Crysis 3 first came out I tested it on a
Pentium with a 780 lightning overclocked
and it performed terrible so they've
obviously updated optimize the game for
dual cause since then and this game
actually plays really well on a dual
core nowadays if keep in mind again
you've got that 15 megabytes level 3
cache how that affects the senior in
this game how that actually affects the
frame rates is yet to be seen because
when I did do my level 3 cache test I
did test it with a 660ti so that being
said though there wasn't much of a
difference here though it is important
to note that the dual core 2 threads in
Crysis 3 scored a pretty significant
lower minimum than all the other
scenarios so for what it's worth in this
game you would want to leave your hyper
threading on let's take a look at the
last game battlefield 4
so for battlefield 4 we went on the test
range of 1440p with custom ultra
settings here and again this was one of
those benchmarks that again didn't make
much of a difference whether you had
hyper threading off or on you see here
there's not much of a difference between
any of these numbers you probably put
down a lot too
variants they've what it's worth the six
score 12 threads did kind of win I guess
in all scenarios they're slightly though
for what it's worth again this is really
not a biggie
I would say that yeah leaving
hyper-threading on in this game would be
desirable as well you wouldn't want to
turn it off I mean I didn't notice any
big stuttering with hyper-threading on
versus off so with that being said let's
move on now to a conclusion so in
conclusion you will just want to leave
hyper-threading on I found turning it
off made no real-world difference to
gameplay and in certain cases it
actually took a hit to our frame rates
especially when we're comparing the dual
core for example to the simulated I 3
also you'll get the benefits of using
hyper-threading in other applications so
if you're rendering a video it'll
definitely take advantage of those extra
threads though that being said this it
is important to keep in mind that these
tests were done on the latest
architecture that's the 5820k on Windows
8.1 which in my opinion Windows 8.1 is
better for multi-threading than Windows
7 so there could be some truth to the
rumors of turning hyper-threading off
helps if for instance you're on I 7 9 20
is the first gen hyper-threaded CPUs on
Windows 7 so there could be some truth
there I mean just going forward we're
not going to be using old hardware and
all versions of Windows so what it's
worth
on an Haswell architecture on Windows
8.1 disabling hyper threading is not
recommended just leave your hyper
threading on it's free performance and
it's good performance anyway so that
