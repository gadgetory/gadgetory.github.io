just coming back to you guys today with
a vlog so got my ran off and I feel
relaxed now guys so I'm gonna vlog about
the whole gaming video games in Japan
and the taboo culture that comes with it
so guys recently i made a video games
channel and it's sort of it's pretty
cool like its arm you know it's it's
sort of going pretty well considering
sending one week it's really like you
know 50 subs you know a thousand video
views really good like it's going good
and basically you know it's weird
because I guess it's doing so well
because video games a really sort of
taboo Japan people don't talk about
gaming and they don't you know they're
not enthusiastic about it and they
especially if you video game and you
talk about people consider you and nerd
or Taku so you know you get called or
Taku which means you know geek nerd but
it's not the same as is in the foreign
you know meaning if you're a nerd it
kind of means you know you can have an
oh that's cool in you know in the
Western society and it's a different
meaning like the nerd here is like its
loser and nerd in one that's what a taco
means pretty much so if you get called
or tackle it means you're a nerd Plus
loser in 1 so that's kind of what they
brand it and guess if you play video
games and you're sort of your talking
especially you don't want to talk to
girls about if you're over here don't
just think you're a nerd straight off so
if you like what you do i play video
games of it their games will your
knowing I stay away from this guy so
yeah guys be careful with that but at
the same time you know I'm passionate
like I you know I've got a gaming box
here I spent you know a lot of money on
my computer because I just love pc
gaming yeah game with my friends guys
it's a passionate hobby of mine has been
since I was you know a little
five-year-old kid you know on the
Nintendo the nests you know I loved it
here games always have always will and
it's been a passionate part of my life
and I kind of Japan it's it's it's a
very shocking in a different culture so
here's the bird little pod she's happy
say hello to everyone needs a little pee
man it's getting cold here too guys
winters really kicking in fast like it's
gone from hot to cold like bang
in like a week so that's another
interesting aspect of a Japan video guys
if you're in Japan and you are
passionate gamer like myself it's
something to be wary of is especially if
you're looking for a girlfriend or you
want to talk to people and get to know
people you may want to keep that video
aspect sort of taboo and hidden and a
fad you know your people very you know
they don't talk about especially at my
work I'm a teacher so I go to work and I
teach English and none of the kids I
never over here the kids tell them
everything and never so I practically
never here and you know even my bird
talks about video games so in contrast
to Japan my bird is sort of his an
Aussie bird and he just likes talking
about video games with me utilize
planted with me and he likes playing
games with me so no but when you come to
Japan you go to be very careful and yeah
that's something to look out for guys i
don't know i think the culture may be
changing but i'm not too sure i mean if
the CIA gaming is very sort of it's not
popular here and there's no there's no
tournaments at all like they don't have
any competitions for video games they
don't really have any you know there's
not it's not really popular at all here
and basically another thing is to is the
fam econ and they got the pc the paso
con and the family car now family con
which is your xbox yeah playstation 3
you know your wii they're really popular
here so the the home consoles and the
home console games are extremely popular
in japan in contrast to pc games people
don't really play pc games here and then
not that popular and the actual pc game
sells on it popular in japan so that's
why a lot of you know like games like
blizzard for instance blizzard
entertainment massive games company they
make world of warcraft you know
starcraft 2 they make these games for
koreans they make these games for
chinese they make you know but change
the language but they don't make the
game they do not make the game for the
Japanese but they don't make world of
warcraft for japanese they release the
english version that's it that they
don't make you know a custom language
like the japanese language interface for
the japanese because it's just not hot
there's no one's it really into pc
gaming here and sad you know because
like i said i love my pc gaming
passionate about it guys and yeah it's a
hobby of mine and you know now that I'm
married with a kid I kind of I actually
funny you know when I'm out in public
and I'm out you know at work I'd say you
know I'm a game I play PC games people
kind of look at me like really like like
you know teacher that's like really you
don't you shouldn't be saying that don't
care you know care factor 0 no I'm just
here to teach you guys English if you
give me smack then I'll probably smack
your butt you know that's just that guys
so you know you really you know it's
really taboo so you want to come and say
hi angel yeah hey my guess but yeah
that's the gaming culture in Japan and
yes it's Christmas soon guys Christmas
next month so take care have a lovely
Christmas but i'll probably get out
another vlog up before then and video
game store and stuff like that like I'm
gonna go down to the DVD store and
actually show you guys the DVD store and
stuff see you guys let me know are you a
passionate video gamer or not and yeah
what games do you play if you play if
you come to Japan are you still going to
be a passionate gamer anyway guys let me
know in the comments section below and
