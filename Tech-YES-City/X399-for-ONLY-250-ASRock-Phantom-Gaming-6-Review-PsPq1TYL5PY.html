was first released,
the motherboards were quite expensive
but fast forward now to late 2018
and ASRock have released an X399 board
that dare you would say is a budget option
coming in around US250 street price
and it's designed specifically for the 12
and 16-core Threadripper variants.
That is the 2950X and also the 2920X.
So today, we're gonna be taking
a look at this motherboard
and pairing it
with the 16-core 32
threaded Threadripper chip
and then overclocking that
as well to four gigahertz
to see if this motherboard's
VRM can handle the beat.
♪ I wish that I was a madman ♪
♪ So that maybe I ♪
- Welcome back to Tech YES
City, and getting straight
into those juicy VRM details for you guys,
they're using an 8-Phase VRM design here
with six phases for the CPU
and two phases for the SOC
with the MOSFETs being
the Intersil/ISL99227IRZ-T
which I rated at 60 amps.
And then for the chokes,
they're using the Magic 60 amp R29-ARs
and then for the capacitors,
Nichicon 12K caps.
For the Vcore digital controller,
they're using the Intersil/ISL69147IRAZ-T.
And then for the V SoCs,
they're using the digital
Intersil/ISL69144IRAZ-T.
So, putting this VRM through the paces,
first off, I tested the
out of the box settings
where the CPU draws up to 170 watts
going up to around about
3.7 gigahertz on all cores,
this soared the VRM temperatures
go up to around about 80 to mid-80s max
in a 26-degree ambient environment.
And then overclocking the CPU
to four gigahertz on all cores
soared the power draw got
up all the way to 260 watts
and this VRM still handled it
with the max recorded
temperature going to 100 degrees,
so it's still well within those limits
and great if you want to use a 2950X
and get a bit more overclocking headroom
out of the CPU on this board.
So now moving on with this motherboard,
it has two eight-pin CPU
connectors up the top,
though in my testing,
even when overclocked to four gigahertz
at 260 watts draw on the CPU,
the one eight-pin was actually fine
even though the cable
itself was getting hot.
So, if you are planning to overclock
the 16-core 32-threaded CPU,
I would recommend plugging
up two eight-pin connectors
just for peace of mind.
However, looking at the
DIMM slots themselves,
you get eight slots and a
running quad channel memory
at 3200 megahertz CL14
with the Flare X memory kit
locking the XMP profiles,
that worked flawlessly,
there was no problems from the get-go.
Moving into the BIOS itself,
ASRock have done a great job
of simplifying their BIOS
and making it super easy to overclock.
And literally, all you
have to do in this BIOS
is change the CPU
multiplier, up the voltage,
and then lock-in your XMP profiles
and you'll be getting some
really nice performance gains.
But speaking of other
features on this board,
there's three full 16x
slots for PCIe available,
as well as three M.2 NVMe slots,
there's one of those that
includes a heat shield.
I did test this with an NVMe drive
and I was happy to report
that it does reduce the temperature,
so it's great if you've got an NVMe drive
that you're using not
just for a boot drive
but maybe for a scratch drive
for editing 4k videos, for example.
Other noteworthy things is
there's a power and reset button
located at the bottom
just in a simplified form
and this sort of helps reduce the costs
yet still keep the feature set available.
The onboard audio
itself, speaking of this,
the crosstalk was phenomenal
up until a volume level of 90.
Once you go 91 volume level and over,
it still has that Realtek problem
where the sound from the left channel
will leak into the right channel,
so this is still not fixed.
I've been identifying
this problem for a while.
So basically, if you're a headphone user
or you're using this onboard audio,
just keep your volume at 90 or below
and you'll have a great experience.
Speaking of the frequency response curve,
that was great too.
There was only a two-decibel
drop off below 10 hertz,
the rest of it was flat,
so it's gonna give you
some good listening,
especially on easy to power headphones.
As for the mic port itself,
they're using noise suppression,
so if you're just using this to play games
with your friends, it will be great.
They won't have any noise coming in.
But if you're using it for
professional recordings,
I'd look into getting an external solution
with a better ADC and amplifier
to get a pure signal
going into the recording.
And then going through the last
of the little nitty-gritties
with this motherboard,
there are three x4 Gen3 PCIe NVMe slots.
One of them even supports SATA
III six gigabits per second.
There is an additional M.2 as well
for WiFi connectivity if you need that.
Looking at the rear of the motherboard,
there's USB 3.0 , USB 3.1,
and Type-C connectivity too,
as well as boasting a dual NIC solution
with one of those
being the Phantom Gaming
2.5 gigabits per second.
So, testing this out, as
well as the USB speeds,
they were absolutely fine.
And the good thing about the 2.5G solution
is it does prioritize gaming packets,
so if you are on a congested network,
this will be beneficial for you.
And lastly, for RGB lovers,
there are two four-pin 12 volt headers,
as well as a five-volt
three-pin addressable RGB header
on the board.
And the southbridge heatsink itself
includes some RGB LED lighting
that can be controlled via
the Polychrome software,
but you can control via
Windows or in the BIOS itself.
So there it all is with the
ASRock X399 Phantom Gaming 6.
Honestly, this motherboard
packs a serious punch
for the money.
I'm actually going to be using
it besides this test bench
in a build to see the
longevity of this motherboard,
to see whether it can
hold up at the overclocks
of four gigahertz with 16 cores 32 threads
over the long run.
The VRM temperatures were
getting a little bit hot
when it was overclocked but
still completely satisfactory,
so it is a great option
for someone who's looking to
get into a Threadripper chip,
especially a 1950X, for example,
which can be had for under $600
and get access to 16 cores 32 threads
if you need that amount of cores.
And also, the BIOS, the extra feature set,
and the onboard audio,
as well as the utility
with three NVMe slots,
three PCIe 16x slots,
really makes this motherboard
a hard-hitting value
for money play if you wanna get on X399.
In terms of negatives
for this motherboard,
I really can't fault it for anything
especially at its given price point.
I also think the look of
this board is so clean.
I really like what they've
done with the VRM heatsink,
for example, where it
encompasses the I/O shield.
Instead of using those
cheap plasticky covers,
they've actually used the
metal from the heatsink itself
and it looks really cool in my opinion.
Anyway guys, hope you
enjoyed today's review.
If you did, then be sure
to hit that Like button
and let me know in the
comment section below
what you think of the X399
Phantom Gaming 6 from ASRock.
In terms of availability,
I can only find it up for
sale at Newegg at the moment.
It will be releasing in
Australia very shortly,
so I will update the description
when those details become available.
And with that said, I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon.
Peace out for now.
Bye.
