asked to compete in a PC part picker
competition where you had to find the
best value based on PC pop pick a
scanner for five hundred dollars and
before I could even do anything two guys
already replied with an AMD CPU and an
rx 570 and I took a look around and I
was like yeah that's about all you could
do on PC pop Pickers website
there was no variance there was no
choices
it was just essentially boring so I just
replied with an odd TX 2070 graphics
card and told
but ladies and gentlemen today we have
something completely different where
I've been asked by the tech fam and I'll
put all their names up on the screen
here to judge their $600
RTX 2060 competition now the rules are
pretty simple they had a 350 dollar
budget for the r-tx 2060 and so the rest
of the money to $250 they had to build
the rest of the system and then they
wanted me to judge based on two
different aspects and that is
performance and also value and then they
got another third aspect and that's
where you guys the lovely viewers come
into play where you judge the aesthetics
and whoever wins out on all these three
scores ultimately will be the winner of
the competition now for me personally I
was pretty simple on judging I made an
objective system where I based it on
rankings and then applied weights to all
the different scores and since it was a
benchmark based on ray tracing I decided
to give portroyal 40 percent of the
weight since it is objectively and
apples to apples to apples benchmark
when I went through the other scores as
well since they asked me to heavily
weigh productivity I decided to give
Cinebench r20 a 30% weighting as well as
the crystal disk mark scores another 5%
each and the total amount of memory
another 5% the gaming benchmarks I
decided to only give them 5% weighting
each since I noticed straight from the
get-go that there was actually quite a
bit of variance between the different
numbers for instance tech by Matt had a
rise in CPU and that was losing to JD
tech is FX 8350 which shouldn't really
be happening under any circumstances and
especially not by this margin since they
are using the same gravis card and this
is how close this competition comes so
if anything I'd like you guys in the
tech fam to retest your numbers because
this is seriously making a big
difference in my opinion between first
second and third place although with
that said let's go through the
contestants first off we had the toastie
bros they made a build in a cardboard
box and then they used a first
generation Xeon now the first generation
Zeon's
are very capable but
if you overclock them and unfortunately
the toastie bros case they couldn't
overclock there's eons
so they got pretty terrible performance
and also on top of that they had a
pretty bad looking builds so this days
they pretty much just wrote off their
whole build but at the same time I can't
help but see a lot of hustle in these
two young gentlemen I love what they do
and I love the fact that they had a lot
of fun doing this competition but next
I'll be had tech by Matt who
surprisingly had a $250 budget got a
risin 5 1400 in this build with ddr4 and
a be 350 motherboard tech by Matt
definitely knows how to look around for
a deal now something is well with this
competition all the contestants had to
get parts online they couldn't get any
local deals and they had to factor in
shipping costs so by doing this they
made the playing field essentially level
for this competition next up here we had
scatter vault who went with a 6th gen I
and I've got to say that his build was
to me personally the most aesthetically
pleasing I thought it was a clean simple
looking bill but it still had a bit of
LED bling this one's definitely gonna be
the easiest I think out of this bunch to
reef lip after this competition if the
builders wish to do so but one thing
that let's scatter vaults build down was
the fact that he used pretty much the
slowest hard drive in this competition
and since productivity did weigh up
quite heavily in this competition he
definitely lost some points due to the
fact that he used a very slow hard drive
and for me personally I hate using very
slow hard drives especially the 5400 rpm
kind if you go to a new 7200 rpm Drive
it definitely is a big difference from a
5400 rpm Drive and a couple with the
fact that he had 8 gigabytes of RAM
which of course is very difficult to get
16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory in a
competition like this he although had
really good gaming and performance
benchmark figures was definitely losing
too to those factors on the productivity
side next up here we've got Danny from
nerd on a budget and Danny you guys may
remember him from back in the past on
the channel when he's had some free time
he's actually done some live streams
with us he's an awesome dude who
definitely knows what he's doing when it
comes to hunting value for money and in
this competition that's exactly what he
did
where he put together a second
Generation Y 5 Sandy Bridge 2500 system
for only like a hundred and thirty
dollars and that was including all the
shipping however one thing I will say
about is builders that he was the only
person to use a hideous looking side
panel on his case so I do feel like this
will weigh in with the aesthetics at the
end even though he clearly won the value
award pretty much coming near half the
budget used in this competition and
still getting quite decent performance
figures moving through the contestants
next up we had Zacks tech turf who put
together a system with a third gen I 5
as well as an OEM board but had 16
gigabytes of RAM and an SSD on this
budget for me personally I feel like
this build is one of the most practical
in the competition especially for just
ordinary gaming I mean sure the r-tx
2060 I'm pretty much all these systems
is a bit overdone but I feel like out of
this whole competition this one is very
practical as well as JD tech gears which
we'll get onto a bit later but on top of
that he had a pretty good-looking build
and pretty much just came in at that 250
dollar price point next up from all the
competitors was the most interesting I
think was the most exciting for me
personally because tech always was using
a I 720 600 K and he was overclocking it
quite aggressively and that was to help
with the competition and get the win but
unfortunately I believe his memory side
of things let him down how do you tune
that memory a lot better and just spent
a bit of quality time with his system I
believe it should have won out most the
benchmarks since a 4.8 gigahertz a 2600
K and that's the levels he got this CPU
to should be definitely whooping a lot
of tail but on top of that the build
looked pretty good with some LED blink
and a clear the side panel and then next
up from coalition gaming is the Xeon
pleaser I absolutely loved what
coalition gaming did with his build
essentially used an old HP z400
motherboard from a dell server and then
used 12 gigabytes of memory on top of
that and coupled that with aw 3690 Xeon
now if you guys didn't know both DW 3680
as well as the W 3690 have unlocked
multipliers however since the
motherboard can overclock there is still
one option available that's to you
the intel extreme tuning utility I
haven't used this personally as I
haven't found any good deals locally on
any of these motherboards but it's
definitely out there in the wild and if
you can find one of these servers very
cheap I have found one over a year ago
but unfortunately I did sell that in a
gaming PC if you do get one of these
then apparently according to coalition
gaming he got this 2 4 gigahertz with a
budget CPU cooler so 6 cores 12 threads
at 4 gigahertz did impress a lot the
performance figures were very good but
since this is a competition and there
was a strict ranking system he didn't
unfortunately get the win but we'll get
onto that later after we look at the
last contestant and that is JD tech gear
who got an FX 8350 in on this budget as
well as 16 gigabytes of RAM and an SSD
so he did utilize the budget as best as
possible I feel for this competition and
he definitely did his research
beforehand because the Cinebench r20
scores were very solid especially for
the money he paid coupled with all the
other factors and on top of that the
bill did look very aesthetically
pleasing too but here's where we'll move
into the ranking system and how I
weighed up all the final scores so what
I've done now is a spreadsheet where
I've put all the different formulas in
to then tally up who would win this
competition and I've simply done it with
who scored the win in that particular
benchmark got 8 points and then last
place got 1 point now here's where it's
a little bit tricky and I would ask the
8 contestants to maybe talk with one
another and perhaps redo some benchmarks
because we got here with the total
points in performance JD tech gear
winning out even though like I said in
the intro Tech bi mát had a rise in CPU
and we clearly said that these anthem
numbers do seem a bit off well actually
not a bit off actually a long shot off
where we've got the lowest contestant
scoring 50 FPS and then the highest
contestant scoring 95 but then tech by
man who I feel should have probably won
this benchmark only got 73 and then
looking this other numbers I feel like
there was just a bit too much variance
between the gaming benchmarks but I did
mitigate that
by giving them only 5% of the final
scores but still that is the difference
between first place and second place as
we see here scatter vault scored pretty
much right behind JD tech gear in these
performance figures but ultimately for
the performance figures I'll pull up the
ranking system here for you guys going
from first place to the last place where
JD tech gear came out and first followed
by scatter vault close second and then
tech bi mát third place now looking at
the value ranking system the second
category we had note on a budget clearly
coming out on front here and basically
how I did things was whoever got the
lowest dollar score got the best
performance per dollar essentially and
then we had second place JD tech gear
and then third place scatter vaults so
this was a very interesting competition
where I feel like so far based on the
rankings it's a very close first and
second between JD tech gear and scatter
vault I feel like maybe you guys will
have even more influence in this on
who's going to win this competition but
for me personally who would I use
scatter volts PC or JD Tech year's PC
I'd definitely be using JD Tech year's
PC at the moment since he has double the
RAM and he also has an SSD in there a
scatter vault system is going to be
hair-pulling out like I will go bald if
I use scatter vault system as a daily
driver if I use JD tech gears system as
a daily driver
I think I'll still have hair on my head
so what I'm going to do is show you guys
slides of all the different builds with
the names attached to those builds and
then there's a straw poll in the
description below where you can decide
who wins this competition but really
when it comes down to I love what each
and every one of these youtubers is
doing and that is essentially creating
their own build and having their unique
take on it and I really enjoyed just
watching all these different guys go at
it with all different systems I don't
think one system was really that much
the same aside from pretty much everyone
using the same power supply and pretty
much some of the people using the same
cases all the CPUs motherboards and
coolers and RAM all those configurations
were very different and I was really
excited because you do get different
options when
comes to PC gaming and that's what PC
gaming I feel is all about now I've
actually ordered in the mail something
new something metal that's going to be
dropping in the next month so stay tuned
for that
it's definitely Zeon it's definitely
budget and you guys are gonna love it
but with that said I loved judging this
competition and really had a fun time I
hope you guys enjoyed this one if you
did be sure to hit that like button let
us know in the comment section below
what do you think of a $250 PC covered
with a $350 graphics card I personally
wouldn't really recommend anyone do this
because you can go out and get like an
rx
580 for like $85 at the moment couple
that with these same builds and you'll
be getting similar performance because
you won't be getting ray-tracing
but as you can see when they turned on
ray-tracing there was a lot of
stuttering with the one and point one
percent lows but also let us know in the
comment section below guys what do you
think of these competitions
do you enjoy them as for me vs.
Christopher ye we have tallied up the
votes and I did score the victory in the
value and the performance so the yeast
layer was victorious in that competition
and I look forward to doing more
competitions with the other youtubers
out there it's a lot of fun it's super
exciting and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye
