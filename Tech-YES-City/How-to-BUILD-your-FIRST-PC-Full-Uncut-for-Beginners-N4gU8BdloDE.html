Barone's you coming back to you guys
today with the long-awaited how to build
a pc so today I'm going to be building a
PC for you guys it's going to be fully
uncut I'm going to be detailing
everything I do and trying to show you
the best camera angles possible and some
little things to look out for as well
now every something to keep in mind
before we start this build is that every
pretty much a lot of computer builds are
going to be different there's going to
be either you've got an APU from AP AMD
which is a different socket to a say an
Intel but that's not to worry because
it's all pretty similar when it comes to
installing just think of it as Lego but
with fancy circuits and traces
everywhere so it really isn't that
difficult everything does connect to one
another and it's I'm going to try and
make this build as simple as possible
for you guys today and without further
ado let's begin now the first thing is
if you are prone to stop statically
shocking stuff then I want you to go and
buy yourself a static wristband
if you don't statically shock anything
then you will not problem you don't need
it a static wristband sorry let's get on
with the build so the first thing I've
done here is put all the parts on the
bench so I want you guys to unbox all
your parts for your build and put them
on the table or wherever you wish to
build it and then I also want you to
take the case apart and take all the
panels off your case and all the screws
and you can put them say I put mine to
the couch to the side here so as you can
see here I've just put my site two-sided
cables power cable and HDMI cable also
my screws and my panels are just sitting
there so they can go on last once I
finish my whole build I can put these
back together so let's get on with the
build here so the first parts the first
part and now you guys can do this in
whichever order you wish to so if you
wish to install the power supply first
then you can me only I like to usually
put the CPU in and the RAM in and put
the CPU cooler on first that's just the
way I like doing things so let's do this
first first things first let's put the
CPU in so the CPU will have an error
which you can guys can see here the
arrow will go and match the arrow on the
actual socket so the arrow is pointing
this way the air is pointing this way it
just goes in like this
and then we just put this down and latch
it in like that that's finished now for
the CPU cooler this is this can be a
little bit tricky I mean if you have a
really big CPU cooler or a water cooler
then you may wish to put the cooler on
last it is up to you guys me I've just
got eight I've just got to stop cooler
here so this is going to be my this is
going to be my home theater PC so
nothing to worry about there so I don't
I can just put the cooler on now and it
shouldn't be a problem
now just as I'm installing this I will
just make sure that I'm doing it
properly getting everything in there now
also this is the part where you want to
put some thermal paste on this is just
some Animax just some stuff that I got
with my CPU aftermarket CPU cooler just
a blob there be careful not to drop it
like I've done I'm in a bit of a rush so
I'm I'm actually doing it a bit sloppy
so be careful when you put usually when
you're putting thermal paste on be a bit
careful I'm just pretty sloppy with this
today I should actually I'll get an
alcohol wipe and wipe that off so yeah
you're going to come into complications
as you do to worry and I did say I'm
going to do this uncut for you guys so I
have dropped some thermal paste on the
motherboard so alcohol wipes are very
handy to clean up any mess on your if
you've got any sort of you know if
you've dropped something you've got some
thermal paste in a place where you don't
want it to be you can just take it off
and it shouldn't be a problem so alcohol
wax they're very important I always
recommend having some of these around
so once you've got that ready to go you
can then put the CPU cooler on which
shouldn't be a problem so this is it
goes in like this it feels cheap because
it is cheap okay put that in like that
CPU cooler goes on CPU cooler says hello
and on then you say cool CPU cooler you
are on ok now your CPU cooler should be
on like that should be in nice and firm
I do recommend the spread method though
taking your time with thermal paste and
doing the spread method I'm just sort of
sort of slapping it on here just because
this is going to be a home theater PC
and I don't really care too much about
over clocks on this so the RAM the next
part is the RAM we're going to put the
RAM in now with the RAM I want you guys
to look at the how the socket is here
you can see here there's a long part and
a short part same with your RAM there'll
be a long part and a short part so as
you do as you put that in like that and
sort of get it in there to get it ready
put your thumbs on both the edges and
just push it in like that and you should
hear those click in and it should be
fine now another thing with RAM is to if
your motherboard has four sockets of RAM
generally use the socket to the closest
to the CPU and it should be in color
code so there should be black and blue
you want to put your black and red or
whatever you want to put your RAM in the
channels that are matching colors so
there may be a gap in between for
instance if this one's black and this
one's red this one's black then you want
to put your RAM in slot 1 and 3 so
that's just it's called dual channel
memory so this one's only got two
sockets so it doesn't matter my channels
my Ram is going to run in dual channel
anyway
and yeah that's that that's the first
part done so that's the motherboard with
the RAM installed and the CPU cooler on
and it's ready to go in the case so the
next part I like to do now is I'll bring
in this in for you guys the next part I
like to do here so we go on fully uncut
beby is we're going to bring the camera
in here and we're going to install the
power supply so power supplies are
pretty straightforward to install this
one is a bottom mount power supply so
you may have a top mount power supply it
doesn't really matter so I want you guys
now to put your power supply in like
this or however it goes in it should be
going in like this anyway
there's many cables and stuff and
goddamn the microphones getting in the
way okay so it goes in here like this
I'm just going to manhandle it in here
so it should go in here and it should
line up and then you should get your
screws out here and just be careful not
to drop them everywhere because you're
going to need them for your build
so get your screws it should have came
with the power supply or the motherboard
or the case generally it comes with the
case or your screws is the four that I
need so these are the four screws for
the power supply and the power supply
should match up to the holes here so
when you see all the holes match up and
you can start putting the screws in and
screwing them off like so magnetized
screwdriver comes in handy just make
sure you don't cross thread the screws
or put them in on a diagonal make sure
they're going straight
my mom yeah this is the probably the
most painful thing about installing a
computer for me is just screws they're
so little and they're so fiddly I
usually hate putting screws in yeah
these ones are nice and big and easy to
put in so that one's got to go in again
so hopefully you guys can see that I'll
pull it out a little bit so you just
install your power supply like there
like that okay
house light is in and we are good to go
okay and now when you screw screws off
the biggest thing you want to make sure
you're doing is you're screwing them
reasonably tight and by that you're just
like this until until sort of your wrist
meets resistance then you can stop so
that's sort of meeting resistance there
that one's pretty good that one's pretty
good now and that one's pretty good so
power supplies in ready to go I will
zoom out for you guys a little bit so
you see it in there now all the cables
you can just get them out the way
because the next part is going to
involve us getting our case like here
and I want you guys now to pull the some
cases don't have these a lot of the
newer cases coming out today don't even
need these but just since this case does
and since some of the cases that you
guys have are going to need these screws
I want you to get these screws out here
they're like these hexagonal gold sort
of screws here so I'm going to need I
don't know how many I'm going to need
but I'm going to pull them all out
and get them ready so I've got eight of
them here and now what I want to do is
before I put them in
I just want to line up and see where I
need to put them as my motherboard
actually has a lot of different holes
here so what I'm going to do is I
usually get my motherboard with cases
like these and I put it in like so and I
just match up the holes so motherboard
is going to go pretty much smooth them
down a little bit motherboard is going
to go here to motherboard is going to go
here and now
I've got a hole here one I've got a hole
here too I've got a hole here three four
five six so I'm going to need six screws
I'm going to need six of these hexagonal
screws and I'm going to have to put them
in here so you just remember where you
need to put them in and then you put
them in so you can do this a few times
if you forget where you exactly need to
put your screws in but since I
remembered I can put these six screws in
here here here and here so this is going
to take a little while but it should be
just remember just take your time with
this you don't have to rush it you don't
have to that one seems to have cross
threaded itself this is this is not a
brand new case by the way fellas
so this ain't a new kicks god dammit
sand a new case but it will work like
one so now that that's there we've got
the six screws in ready to go that match
the six screws here on my motherboard we
can then put the motherboard in and get
it ready now if your motherboard did
come with a bracket here you can put
that in here so there might be a bracket
that you can put in here if you have one
of them put them in by all means I don't
have one as I lost it so I won't
unfortunately be putting it in however
we do have now we have to get out
another six screws so with our screws
that came with the case we can get out
eleven II I think I've only actually got
six of these screws so I got to get
these screws now that plug into those
hexagonal screws that we had before so
it's pretty simple it's just now this is
where the magnetized screwdriver really
comes in handy if you drop a screw as it
really starts to get annoying
this stage so what you want to do is you
want to put in this one here I usually
just put the one in the bottom right
corner in and the top left corner in
first and that generally gives the model
it stops the motherboard from shaking so
I just line that up if you have washers
as well then try to put washers in as
well try to put the washers on but they
generally yeah they should I mean if you
have washers yet put them on I just
don't have any so my experience it
doesn't really matter if you're a cow
cases earth anywhere it shouldn't be a
problem
here we go so it's putting those screws
in there again wrist tight you see me
tightening them here I'm going to risk
just tighten them reasonably tight
reasonably tight like Austin Powers
reasonably tweet so that's this one
going in okay I think this screw is
actually the wrong signs god damn ghetto
screw go in there I think it went in
now this one's a bit of a pain up here
in the top right depending on your case
like you can see here my screwdriver
actually isn't even split of clipping
that screw yeah it's still going in
nonetheless and this one should go in
like so okay so there we have it
motherboard in motherboard okay we're
all good to go that parts done
now the next part we can do is take a
step back grab this drive bay out and I
have an SSD
so I'm gonna have to mount this SSD to
this hard drive tray and I'm going to
mount it this way since the power and
the Saito connection are here so I just
going to take a step back here put that
there and just grab two screws because
it's an SSD it's actually got no moving
parts so I only really need to put two
screws in here on one on the diagonal
here and another on the other diagonal
so I'll just show you guys like that
this is actually a bit of a pain in the
ass so yeah like screwing things will
take you for me it takes the longest
amount of time because yeah I have
really rough hands so delicate things
like this always take time for me okay
so because I want in like that
okay now I'm using an SSD for this build
usually you probably have a mechanical
hard drive if you do then that should go
in even easier because most of these
hard drive trays are three and a half
inches wide this is only two and a half
inches wide this SSD so unfortunately it
needs to have a few screws
so I guess this case you could say that
this case I'm using today is semi screws
it's actually not fully screwless so
like that we're just putting the SSD bay
in and another note is we will get our
cd-rom drive in as well
so yeah okay this is the bit where I
feel retarded because this is not okay
okay it's going in now hallelujah okay
so there's your SSD drive ready to go we
again just put that on the right here
back in here so that's done that's our
SSD ready to go DVD Drive up the top
here focus in or zoom in there DVD drive
is going to go up the top here since
this is a screwless case I can just take
this off here and then I can put the DVD
drive in like this so pretty very
straightforward it's also got screw
holes as well however I generally only
use my DVD drive for an OS install and
then I take it out anyway so with this
screwless thing it's actually got things
that's kind of they kind of like screws
that clip in like screws and then you
sort of lock them like that and that's
really quick so that shouldn't be a
problem now the next part of the build
is so we're just about finished here
with the actual sort of installing
components we're actually going to get a
sound card in so since this is going to
be a home theater PC for me I'm actually
going to install a sound card and also
my graphics card so you can go just can
do this in any order you want you can
install the graphics card first or the
sound card first I'll probably install
the sound card first so I will take this
thing off here so you can take these off
and bend them off and get them out which
I'm going to do here there it is comes
off and we just put the sound card in
like this so hopefully you guys can see
that
grab the sound card put it into the PCI
Express like this and it's in like that
clearing that heatsink no problems and
since this is actually a screwless on
the rear here it's actually got it like
a screwless kind of support mechanism we
can just use that for this since the
sound card is pretty sorry since the
sound card is pretty lightweight that
screwless thing there will actually hold
it in place
however the for the gravis card we do
not want to use since this is a big
gravis card
it's a GTX 670 so I let you go and have
a look at that this graphics card is a
monster so we're not going to use the
screwless design on the case we're going
to actually put two little screws in the
side to secure the graphics card in so
here we go here we'll just put the
graphics card in like this okay and when
we just screw the graphics card off and
secure that in with two screws if you
have a smaller graphics card that's
really light then you can use the
screwless mechanism it's up to you guys
but this is really basic and simple oh
god that's a big graphics card am just
trumps over this motherboard this
motherboard socket fm1 and this is an a8
3 800
Cirie's APU but anyway so there's a
graphics card there's the sound card
installed now the next part you guys
want to do this is the fun part is you
want to start installing all the cables
so here we have the cables here all the
power cables can start going on now
since this is a 650 watt power supply it
does have a lot of clutter and it's not
modular so you want to grab your case
here and run all these cables through
the rear so like this get all your
cables you can now kind of run them
through the rear here this is a penny
bit of a family asses this step so just
be careful and make sure you don't
actually break anything you're doing
try to show you guys what's going on
here I'm just bringing this through the
rear like
now I'm not actually going to do cable
management for you guys because that
takes my microphones clipping off
clipping off man
microphones clipping off okay it should
be good now so we got the case here we
got it ready like that now what we want
to do here is basically start bringing
the cables in through these sleeves here
and plugging them in to where we need
them so alright so I've pulled up a
picture here for you guys because
unfortunately my camera overheated and I
didn't realize until right at the end so
this here is basically you've got the 80
X 24 pin in white now that's a big power
cable it usually comes in a 20+4 pin
configuration and I thankfully I just
was I just had enough cable lengths to
run it through the back if you don't
have enough cable length and don't be
afraid to run it straight over the
gravis card and straight into the board
so yeah that's the first thing you want
to connect and when you connect these
power connect power cables make sure the
power is off so that's just something to
be mindful of and also at the top left
in red is the CPU eight pin so this
usually comes in two by four pin
configuration and they'll go right next
to each other and they should slot
straight in I unfortunately didn't have
enough length to run this through the
rear I had to run this straight over the
graphics card as you'll see later and
then the next part is in green in the
green text with the arrow pointing is
the PCI Express pins now these plug up
to your graphics card and they usually
come in six pin or eight pin if they
come in an eight pin configuration they
usually come with a six plus two pin
configuration so as you can see here
mine actually requires two because it's
a pretty high-end graphics card and it
uses a lot of power so I actually have
to plug a six pin and an eight
into this if you have a lower round
graphics card you can generally they run
off the motherboards power and so don't
be surprised if your graphics card
doesn't have one of these PCI Express
pins it's nothing to worry about
most mid-range cards generally require
one six pin so that's just yet something
to be mindful of so once you plug them
in they should be okay mine thankfully I
was able to run this through the rear
and plug it straight in as well so I did
have an off cable length there now the
last part is the SATA power connectors
now these are usually really thin and
really elongated and they've got a
little L so these are unique in their
own right and they plug straight into
usually they plug into your hard drives
or your DVD drives so as we see here my
SSD is the it needs one of these and
also my DVD right up the top that's
going to require one as well so I've
plugged one into that and one into the
one into my SSD and one into the DVD
drive up the top now let's move on to
the next stage where my camera started
yeah well I got footage working again so
let's move on ok so now that I have the
DVD drive installed with the SATA cable
look at the SSD install the SATA cable I
can now begin to do the final stage
which is plugging up the actual SATA
cables to the motherboard so I just put
that one in like that goes into the end
here it'll plug into the solder port
here so generally you want your SD on
the first side of port which will be
labeled solder one or SATA 2 and that's
what I'm going to use so it's going to
put my solder cable into the SSD like
that not like that again yeah there we
go one in okay and like that
wait this ain't going in so I'm going to
put this one here and put this one here
since I don't have any extra SATA cables
and this one's like a hook hook shaped
sided cable okay so there we go
SATA cables in DVD drives in SATA cables
going to do is you're over here that's
on side a port for this is on side a
port ones it is on the first side of
ports going to mass sd things are good
to go
we're almost already the last part of
the build now is I'll try and show you
guys is to actually get these little
cables hooked up these little ones now
these will go down the bottom of your
motherboard generally so I'll try and
get you guys a good look in here this is
probably in my opinion this is one of
the biggest pains in the asses of
installing computers so you'll have all
your power cables here you got fan looks
like fan controllers which I don't I'm
not going to bother with this is only
home theater PC we got the HDD LED power
switch which is important and power LED
and the reset switch so these will all
go in one thing here which is this one
here as it's got the part it's got in
real small writing it's got the labels
there and the power LED is at the top
which is positive and that's the green
and the white is negative so I'm going
to take it that the from infant ring
from inferencing this one I'm going to
take that be led I mean the black and
they get white are your negatives on the
other switches as well so let's just put
those in there like that okay that's it
you can use tweezers if you want to I've
done this enough that I'm sort of used
to it now so power button is right next
to it and the reset switch is in the
ah ah so I'm guessing it goes like that
and the power switch goes like that okay
so the power switch goes in here your
motherboard should come with a manual
that lets you know which one goes to
which I'm doing a little bit of
guesswork but it should be fine and HDD
led so it goes in there like that okay
there we go so those are in there now
this is your USB front panel USB so that
can just go to a USB port over here
there's one over here it should be
straight you can just match that one
that's the corner and there's no corner
there so I can just put that straight in
as you can see it's clipping my video
card which is actually not good ok
another USB just plug that straight in
again like so ok and HD audio so there
we go
HD audio goes in here
like this okay yeah
these are graphics cards in the way it's
a little bit of a pain in the ass to get
gone but that's it guys that's all
finished so there you have it the
computer build is all good and ready to
go
cable management I can do that as I
recommend in all my other builds cable
management I recommend doing it later
when you guys know that your computer is
working everything is working perfectly
for instance if your power supply is
faulty and you've done cable management
you have to pull that cable management
apart again so cable management we can
see that for another day if you guys
want to see a cable management guide I
can do one with this PC but here it is
here it's all finished it's all good to
go now I just got to put the cases all
the panels back on and that's pretty
much it finish off this PC so put them
on the way they came on make that DVD
drive works cool everything works pretty
everything works pretty good everything
feels pretty sturdy and the we are good
do so you can whack these fans here they
can actually plug into a fan the molex
cables that I had before I'll just
quickly run them through the back for
you guys here yeah this case and this
power supply unfortunately the length of
the cables on this power supply are
pretty short which doesn't leave or
doesn't let me have that good of cable
management or allow me to have such a
great options for doing good cable
management if you guys want to have good
cable management then you probably want
to buy a better case than the one I'm
using here and you also probably want to
get a power supply it's modular as well
so anyway this is this one finished so
I'm just plugging in the case fans here
you guys can see that there
okay that's done all right put that side
panel back like that
okay put the other side panel on the
rear back on so like this I'll show you
guys here it's gonna be a bit of a bad
fit because the cables are running out
the rear that it'll fit on nonetheless
get a cable management for you guys
there it's pretty bad I mean yeah you
should do it I just want to get finished
and boot it up and make sure
everything's okay so when you first boot
it up you want to go into boss and make
sure that your DVD drive is priority
boot and so this PC is good to go there

ready to boot if you did like this guide

help you guys I hope you enjoyed this
this is just build a PC for a noob it
was completely uncut and so don't you
know don't be afraid to take your time
and look at the steps that I did and
follow them and you know if you have
problems like it you sell me out plug in
cables in there sometimes they are
annoying to get plugged in but you know
that's what happens when you build pcs
it's not to worry so you know there's
the uncut full version of how to build a
PC so my baby he ripped off these front
panels here for the DVD drive so this
case has seen better days and I will be
coming back to you guys soon with how to
get
buuut times how to boot your pc up a lot
of people been asking me how to boot up
your pc fast you know the budget builds
coming out everything's gonna be coming
out for you guys soon if you have any
requests let me know in the comment
section below or send me a PM I've
always doing requests for you guys
that's what I'm here for
here's a PC ready to go this is my home
theater PC I'm actually going to take
that graphics card out because my GTX
670 is still my main graphics card for
gaming on my older PC there we go so
there you have it that's how to build a
PC and ya took about half an hour
probably bit longer there not to worry
so once the computer is all built all
you have to do is press the power button
and your computer should turn on and I
want you guys to go into the BIOS so
once you start it up here you just hit
the Delete key on your keyboard and you
want to enter the BIOS so I'll get I'll
zoom in for you guys here
you want to enter BIOS so hopefully that
goes in there yeah and so once we enter
boss all we have to do is change a
setting because it usually it doesn't
make a big difference but it's something
that I like to do is I like to go to
advanced storage configuration and just
change this one to a HCI mode and then
you can just also what else I like to do
is I like to if you can see here you can
also see my first site of Portus is my
my c drive or my SSD and then also you
just go into boot and we select this
time around I'm going to be booting off
the DVD Drive first so I want to boot
off the DVD Drive and then exit Save
Changes and exit and that's it
I also might play around with this I'll
just play around with this - I'm going
to have maybe an overclock tutorial for
the AMD APU since I haven't really used
it that much but I'd like to sort of
overclock it and tweak it so we're going
to boot from the CD and that's it guys
that's about it so you boot you you boot
your OS install your OS and that's about
it
so know you guys if you have any
questions please leave a comment in the
comment section below

urgent and if you liked this video

boot priority back to your C Drive well
your SSD or your hard drive and then
leave your D your D Drive or your cd-rom
burn on DVD burner not last
