today we're taking a look at the asrock
phantom gaming XZ 390 motherboard now
we're gonna get the negatives out of the
way first there's two negatives I see
with this motherboard first is the price
it's very expensive 349 u.s. dollars in
Australia it's going to be released
sometime in September I believe and then
I'll update the pricing in AUD in the
description below for you guys in Aussie
land but also another thing with Z 390
as we can probably tell is that this is
a one-time purchase in that I don't
really see an upgrade path for this
motherboard past the 9900 K but with
that said today we're gonna be testing
this board on the 9900 K and I'm gonna
be doing a special test to try and
extract as much power through the vrm as
possible with an FPU test in i-264
okay that didn't work so who managed to
get the CPU draw up to 270 watts but it
pretty much froze is the vrm handled it
absolutely fine and now speaking of the
vrm they are using ASL six nine one
three eight also ISL six six one seven
eight for the driver and also the
doubler and on the chokes they're using
SMD 60 amp solutions and then for the
capacitors we've got 12 k nichkhun caps
now the phases we're talking about a
fourteen phase vrm here but technically
it's a power stage since there you are
using driver MOSFETs and these are the
vishay si si six three fours so a pretty
high-end solution though speaking of the
temperature tests I had a ninety nine
hundred K at five gigahertz at one point
three six volt and yes I know my ninety
nine hundred K NGO sample is not the
best example but it's actually good for
testing out V RMS and checking out the
temperatures where we could see here a
ninety degree of raw vrm MOSFET temp and
then 63 degrees on the heatsink this
isn't a 24 degree ambient environment so
you won't needed active cooling solution
on this vrm even if you're overclocking
the 99 hundred K so the most important
part of this motherboard that is the BRM
checks out it's good to go but what
about all the other features on this
motherboard as I honestly need a bit of
a warm-up in preparation for all the x5
70 motherboards to be released and with
that said let the testing begin
so with any motherboard test I always go
deep into the armboard
audio and here they're using the realtek
ALC 12:20 and they've also got the
option for the creative similar five
overlay where you can configure things
through software now you will want to
install this driver to get the best
results but speaking of the crosstalk so
minus 90 decibels on both left and right
channels and this is on a hundred volume
level which is phenomenal and I keep
saying this every few months the more
higher-end motherboards come through
these are the best numbers I've seen as
we move over to the frequency response
curve we can see here that 10 to 20
Hertz there's no drop-off at all in bass
roll-off and then 0 to 10 Hertz we've
got a -2 decibel roll-off so basically
in terms of pairing this with mid-range
cans and also even some high range cans
this will do a phenomenal job of giving
you crystal-clear audio since they are
also using on the front headphone out a
headphone amplifier named idli the NE 5
5 3 2 and they've also got niche akan
caps and an isolated area for that
onboard audio which does show in both
the crosstalk and the frequency response
numbers the rest of the audio throughout
the whole range is pretty much
completely flattened then having a
smooth roll-off as you enter the end of
the test which it maxes out at 20
kilohertz on this particular test and
they've also got up to 32 bits 192
kilohertz of room there to wiggle on the
headphone out and then for the mic in
and also lining you've got support for
up to 24 bit depth at 192 kilohertz now
speaking of the mic input another test
that I like to throw in for you guys
it's exceptional I believe they're only
using a slight amount of noise
suppression as I couldn't really detect
any so basically if you wanted to use
this for professional recordings you
could even use this onboard ear solution
to do just that and get good results but
now here honestly is where the asrock
phantom gaming axe breaks away from all
the other Azeroth boards in this lineup
and that is the feature set first of all
we've got 8 PWM fan headers which in the
bar so you can use the fan tuning
software to make custom profiles and
tune every individual fan header itself
or you can auto tune with the fan tuning
software which will do its job for you
based on the temperatures and then
moving into the SSD they've also got
three
nvme slots all covered by that massive
bottom heatsink when I did test with an
SSD drive an octane 32gig solution a
family were getting 43 degrees in the
software and then 38 degrees with the IR
camera the one thing I did get a little
bit of interference here with the RGB
LEDs and also when we had the heatsink
off we're getting 58 degrees and 59
degrees respectively
so this heatsink it's massive it's doing
a good job for the aesthetics but it's
also doing a good job of cooling down
nvme SSD drives which all of these slots
are x4 pcie 3.0 by the way now moving
further into the BIOS itself this is
their UEFI BIOS it's pretty much one of
those things that works and if it works
you don't need to fix it it's got all
the options you need for me personally
especially if you're an enthusiast
water-air overclocker can change all the
voltage timings I have noticed they have
added the additional Samsung be die
tight timings there if you want to get
even tighter timings on your memory and
better performance there's also the
ability to update your BIOS fire and
active internet connection and you can
save up to five different overclocking
profiles and lastly the RGB polychrome
software or should I say hardware in
this case because you don't need to
install any software within Windows in
order to change your RGB controls now
the headers on this board you've got two
12-volt outs in a 5 volt addressable
which you can then control and change
with up to 13 different effects plus
random and that's for also the two
included areas with the heatsink down
south and then the i/o shield up north
you can change those individual lighting
zones to now continue on with the
feature set up this board you get Wi-Fi
a X 8'o 2.11 a X and that's essentially
known as Wi-Fi 6 I did manage to do a
speed test hooked up to mine ass and it
was capping out the right speeds at 1300
megabits per second and then the raid
speeds were pretty much capping out at
3000 megabits per second so this Wi-Fi
solution does work pretty well I'd love
to test it at higher speeds but
unfortunately I can't hear the studio
and saying with the realtek 2.5 g
solution I tested that out and that was
maxing out the raid speeds over that
landline over 3,000 megabytes per second
and then we've got two additional NICs
on board for 3 in total those other two
being Intel solutions if you want to use
them for instance for gaming if you
don't try
the real tech then you can use those two
additional headers as well they're going
over the back of this board you've also
got your Wi-Fi antenna included in this
package and six USB ports four of those
being Gen 3.2 I know it's a little bit
tedious with the naming scheme Gen 1
solutions are scoring up to 5,000
megabytes per second they're type-a
connectors and then we've got an
additional three Gen 2 solutions
swearing up to 10 gigabits per second
and also a type C which will give the
same speeds now testing out those USB 3
speeds they did check out absolutely
fine also on the rear of the board
you've got that trusty clear CMOS button
which I love to have implemented on any
motherboard that has to do with
overclocking and they've also got their
integrated IO shield which they make a
claim that as rocks the only brand that
has a little bit of flexibility in it so
you won't have to worry about whatever
case you install this motherboard into
you're gonna have east of fitting with
that flexible IO shield now going over
the last of the features with this
motherboard got a debug LED power and
reset buttons and also an overclocking
header out as well as USB 3.2 gen one
two USB front out headers for those two
make four ports in total as well as a
one type-c out Gen 2 so it's a little
bit confusing with that naming scheme I
know but this board is ultimately just
feature packed I honestly couldn't think
of one more thing that would need to do
to add any more features into this
motherboard it pretty much hits the nail
on every head I can think of so with
that said let's move over now
to a conclusion so there it is with the
phantom gaming ax and as we said in the
intro it's three hundred and forty nine
US dollars a big ask for a mainstream
motherboard though it is what they call
their flagship board in every single
test I did here today on this
motherboard definitely was worthy of
calling it a flagship board now I am
looking forward to what asrock is doing
on the X 570 line but this is definitely
some good practice form as we can see
with that onboard audio solution they've
got that perfect now the vrm solution
especially a high-end solution like this
was implemented with no problems
whatsoever and then we move over to the
rest of the feature set it is just
jam-packed with up to eight different
PWM fan headers on board and the BIOS
checks out the stabilities there and
also the heat sinks all do a good job of
keeping this board
control even with a bad sample like I've
got over 9900 K that puts out a lot of
heat now speaking of the heat sinks
themselves the last thing to mention is
they have got a heat sink that does come
over the back of the board
they say this gives more stability I
just think it's more of an aesthetic
thing and more of a premium feel which
is a welcome addition but again that 349
u.s. dollar price tag if you guys are
willing to get the best from asrock then
this will definitely offer the best one
thing that is missing I guess the only
thing to critique is that on some of the
boards at this price range as rock in
the past have implemented a 10 gigabit
per second Knick solution this one
however is 2.5 gigabits max so that's
the only thing I could think of though
it is pretty expensive in their defense
to implement these tanking a bit per
second solutions and not everyone uses
them dare I'd say not enough people use
them for them to be a viable solution on
every single flagship motherboard though
speaking of the next best thing if you
want to get on the 9900 K and you don't
to spend this much on the motherboard
I've also tested out the phantom gaming
nine that can be had for 220 US dollars
so you say basically a hundred and
thirty USD and pretty much get the same
performance in terms of overclocking and
everything else but ultimately this is
that board for someone who just wants
everything from a motherboard from the
get-go though with that aside even if
you're in the market for one of these
things I'd seriously wade around the
corner and just check out what AMD's got
with the x5 70 launch that's coming up
very soon I'll be covering that here on
the channel and if you guys enjoyed this
review then be sure to hit that like
button for us also let us know in the
comments section below what do you think
of as rocks new design with their
phantom gaming series I'm actually
thinking it's pretty clean that in the
SteelSeries legend I think they're
hitting the mark in 2019 quite well I'm
really looking forward to giving you
guys some coverage on X 570 as well and
with that said if you want to see that
the moment it drops be sure to hit that
subscribe button ring the bell and I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye
