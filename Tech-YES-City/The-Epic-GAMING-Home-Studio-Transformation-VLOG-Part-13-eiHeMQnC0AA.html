I'm gonna do where I'm going to turn
this whole room into a epic gaming
station slash studio slash Galactic
Empire battle Star Destroyer
so if the recent use that you guys
probably know that yeah I got divorced I
decided to turn this pole bottom stairs
living room into a studio and I'm gonna
be doing this in a three-part series
where today I'm gonna be outlining sort
of the work that needs to be done
getting the stuff ready and then in part
two I'll be setting everything up and
then part three the tech will get ready
and you'll see the final result so
anyway let's get on with it okay so this
first part what we're gonna do is we are
going to remove these curtains get rid
of them and then we're gonna take this
rail off and now since this is an old
house what I'm going to decide to do is
I'm going to buy five sheets of gyproc
and then I'm gonna use these original
screw holes here and then screw the
gyproc in so this will allow me to
pretty much have a hassle-free uninstall
mentalis house and pretty much take the
jib rock off throw it in the bin and the
house will still be the same once I put
the rails back on etc etc now since this
is an old house I do not want to use it
its current form as a backdrop because
it'll be pretty ugly right so I figured
I'll go down the hardware store buy some
cheap jib rock will probably cost me
like $25 for all the gyprock plaster it
up seal it off and then paint it and
that'll probably cost me all up $80 for
a whole new backdrop that is really
modern so anyway that being said let's
go down and get the stuff Oh they've got
gyprock here and it is pretty cheap so
we're just gonna get five sheets of this
stuff and then we'll it back home and we
are good to go but also while we're here
we will go look at some paint and get
some paint as well so here's the section
where we're gonna look at paint and I've
decided to go with some big big bright
red here so we'll get some of this it is
about $30 for the big can but that
should do five sheets of jib rock
absolutely fine of course we can't
forget the paint roller set this is five
bucks but it'll be good to go and we
need some putty and some tape and then
we're pretty much good to go oh yeah we
gotta get the paint too
all right well we have this all right so
it's a new morning and a new day new
possibilities we've got here the paint
roller tray set that I picked up so
that's got a roller and the trails like
five bucks I got like a Stanley knife
and a little paintbrush for fixing up
edges got some red paint and some putty
and some nails and all that goodness and
all that was like 30 something dollars
that wasn't too bad then here we have
the gyproc so that's gonna go up pretty
soon but before we do that I just want
to document the work here like we've got
I decided to put up some wood over the
studs so this will pretty much make it a
lot easier for the gyproc to go in and
especially since we had some little
things like aircon power cables and
stuff like that sticking out this will
just make the whole process from really
easy so that if I do want to remove it I
can just bang the the gyproc out and
then just take the nails out because
they're these pieces of wood are
actually connected into the studs and so
that'll just make it really easy not
only for taking it off if I want to take
the wall off but also for banging the
gyproc in because I can just now measure
that from the top and the bottom and I
know where these studs are to bang the
gyproc into so that's that process now
all's we have to do is cut a little bit
off the edge of the gyproc and start
putting these gyprock sheets up booyah
there's some other goodies that I picked
up as well I got a here's the microwave
that's like breakfast is ready so last
night's dinner yeah anyway we've got a
kiss x6i I think this is like the 650d
or the t4i I picked this up for three
hundred dollars is gonna be like a new
camera that I'm gonna film on because my
EOS m it's pretty good but I just can't
actually hook up a tablet into it
remotely so I want to be able to hook in
a tablet and film remotely but we'll do
more on that and like a later part when
I'm actually getting all the hardware
set up and then I got this tripod as
well I picked this tripod up for ten
dollars it's a fluid head like it's a
tional fluid head tripod so
I'll be doing some filming on this and
seeing how it goes but just yet and I've
got a 50 millimeter knockoff lens coming
as well it's called the yongnuo it's
like a nifty 50 knockoff you know gonna
be interesting to see how it performs
all right so we have cleaned up
everything and we are now ready to start
putting the jit rock walls on and start
banging them in oh yeah
yeah we're ready to start cutting the
first sheet of gyproc and that will give
us an idea of yeah how much well we
already know how much we need to take
off but you can do the first pilot run
here and then see how it stacks up and
yeah we're gonna put that sheet of wood
underneath the jib Rock so don't cut
into the floor okay well there's the
first sheet of gyproc and that's in and
that's good to go so we're gonna start
banging in the rest of the sheets now
we'll remember guys when you cut you've
got a cut for Biba
so we've smacked up all the gyproc
boards here and now we just have to go
down and get some tape some teeth as
well for the bottoms there and also some
plaster so we can start finishing up
these walls and I thought hey we wise
we'll just fix a hole on the wall of the
previous resident put for the door so
boo-yeah two birds with one get rock
okay well I've plastered up the walls
now and that is part one concluded guys
so please give this a big thumbs up if
you want to see part two and in part two
we'll be painting the walls and also
laying out some carpet on the floor and
then we're gonna get the desks as well
so stay tuned for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
