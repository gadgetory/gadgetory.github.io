tech deals that come up for my fellow
Aziz Down Under
however before we get onto those tech
deals if you are in the u.s. I'm still
taking care of your ddr4 memory a four
gig stick for 27 US dollars now this is
a really good deal considering the
current prices of ddr4 memory is so high
and it's only gonna get worse into 2018
there is also a gtx 1080 on ebay going
for 470 us pretty good deal and the last
is coming from you egg with a 1600 X and
also a X 370 motherboard going for 270
dollars and if you're in the UK and you
want some deals and pounds there's the
ace of predator 2 7 1 144 Hertz 27 inch
IPS panel going for 360 quid
really damn good considering the specs
of this monitor there is also the cloud
revolver headset from Kingston going for
50 quid and then the last of the deals
from the UK is the GTX 1060 for a
hundred and eighty eight quid though if
you're in Canada I don't forget about
you guys one deal I found out was a be
350 motherboard going for 75 Canadian
dollars though with that aside let's get
on to the plethora of deals that I have
for my fellow Aussies and these aren't
the deals that you get on camera
welcome back to check yes City in the
first deal I have in AUD is a gtx 1070
from in o3d so it's got a custom cooler
on it 525 a strangles after you use the
coupon code plug 20 and now for a lot of
these deals you're gonna have to use the
coupon code plug 20 so don't forget that
msi RX 570 if you like grab its cards
finally these prices have come down two
hundred and ninety five dollars this is
the msi variant with the aftermarket
cooling does a really good job in games
and staying quiet as well or if you want
to keep things small and you want more
power there is the gtx 1070 Galax katana
this is the single slot edition going
for 519 australian or if you want to
step it up to a gtx 1080 EXO c sniper
this is going for 687 australian and of
course if you want the big granddaddy
the gtx 1080 TI this is the duke edition
my favorite edition out of all the 1080
t eyes this thing is big it's got three
really low profile fans does a great job
of cooling and it comes out overclocked
out of the box going for a 920
australian dollars though the loss of
the grab scouts i have for you guys is a
gtx 1060 from gigabyte going for a 255
is strangles delivered to your door so
not bad at all
though to power some of these grabs
cards you may need a beastly power
supply however you can get away
especially with the budget graphics
cards with something like an antique 500
watt power supply going for 48 austrane
dollars really good value for money
considering this is delivered to your
door as well or if you need to step
things up EVGA 650 watt gold rated pass
play 119 australian though if you need
even more power at your disposal then we
can go crazy if you're setting up a
mining rig for example 1600 watt EVGA
power supply this thing is going for 447
Australian dollars after the 20 percent
discount I believe this is the biggest
power supply you can currently get for
an ATX sized PC case though of course
what about motherboards and CPUs well if
you want to build a new PC on a budget
maybe 350 for a hundred and eight
dollars from gigabyte and also a risin 5
1600 for 260 Australian is a fantastic
combo for your money though if you want
to get something like the new coffee
Lake system that's actually kind of
really hard to get a hold of in the
price
is a really high at the moment cuz
people are scalping it you do have an
alternative here me out here z170
motherboard going for a hundred and
eleven dollars delivered to your door
and you can get the 7600 K for two
hundred and seventy strains so this is
coming in cheaper than the eighty three
fifty K which is practically the same
thing
but the motherboard costs are so much
cheaper than a Z 370 chipset but what if
you want to step things up you want to
do a bit of video editing streaming well
there's the horizon 7 1700 going for 375
dollars includes a cooler and a great
mother board to couple this with is an X
370 from asrock this is the Tai Chi I
use this build in my personal rig it is
a fantastic motherboard one of the best
X 370 motherboards you can get not just
in overclocking but also on the quality
of the board itself this thing is going
for 270 Australian so now you may be
planning on getting a rise in CPU and
they do come included with pretty decent
stock coolers however they still are
limited once you start overclocking high
enough you will need a better cooling
solution and also the 7600 K doesn't
even come with a cooler at all so in
that case you may want to step up your
cooling game so I have the antic cooler
1200 this is a 240 mm rad also with two
fans included going for a hundred and
three or strained all this so if you
only need a 120 ml rad cooler master
have their variant going for around
about $72 delivered to your door this is
the Sadin does a great job as well
especially for a risin 515 hundred and
seventy 600 K or even a new CPU like the
80 350 K or even the 8600 case only this
will be great on a budget and if you
plan on getting a coffee Lake CPU when
the prices come down these coolers are
definitely worthy of your money so a
tech deals video just wouldn't be
complete without a deal on some kind of
storage so I have for you guys are 240
you byte SSD from SanDisk going for 103
AUD delivered to your door now if you
want to step up your storage game you do
a bit of video editing you need the
fastest speeds you need the extra
storage then we've got here this Samsung
one terabyte 960 pro nvme Drive
extremely quick going for 556 Australian
dollar may even consider getting one of
these things in my new nass solution
that I'm gonna be putting downstairs to
run all my games off over a 10 Gigabit
Ethernet connect
this thing is just lightning fast anyway
