guys have sent in PC parts that either
are broken and you'd like me to try and
fix them or you've sent in PC parts that
are completely working fine and you just
want to support the channel so big thank
you you guys and the most curious of the
parts that got sent in was a brand new
risin v 1400 with a lot of bent pins so
today we're gonna try and fix these
broken pots and see if we can get them
working welcome back to tech yes city
this is brian coming to you guys today
with that video where we're going to try
and fix up first of all this Rison v
1400 now if you somehow happen to get
bent pins on a rise in CPU then you've
clearly done something wrong in the
process of installing this CPU in the
case of Matt from the UK he sent in his
rising CPU I didn't ask him how he did
this he just said he had a rising CPU
with a lot of bent pins and when I saw
this it did have a lot of bent pins I've
never seen this many pen pins on a
rising CPU in my life before and I don't
know how you do something like this but
we're gonna try and fix this and the
problem with PGA versus lgo PGA being
the AMD CPUs is that the pins are
generally stronger so you won't get away
with a mechanical pencil or in the case
of using a toothpick like I usually do
it doesn't work either so in this case I
had to actually use a screwdriver and a
pair of tweezers to try and fix up all
these bent pins now the difficult thing
about fixing up PGA socketed pins is
that because they're stronger and you
use a little bit more force if you bend
them back the other way and especially
if they've been bent pretty hard then
you can snap the pin off and in the case
of the Verizon v 1400 I was on my
kitchen bench trying to fix this and
then on my couch for literally hours on
end just bending pins back and forth and
in the process two of the pins actually
snapped off because they were really
weak to begin with so with that I did
manage to finally fit it in the socket
and if you do this you have to of course
be very careful I found actually that
the mechanical screwdriver did end up
working the best for me one with a very
thin tip and then you had a lot more
control of course if you've got bad
tools in your arsenal like a really fine
piece of tweezers then you'll probably
have a better time doing this and when I
installed the CPU it did actually work
in the end I booted up into the BIOS I
got into the bias that one very odd
thing with those two broken pins off was
that we were now running in single
channel memory mode and I confirmed that
it wasn't the motherboard when I
installed a different rosin CPU that I
had around here so we're now in single
channel mode and we couldn't get dual
channel mode to work so I pulled out the
CPU and then tried to put two broken
pins back in from another CPU so I
busted off off a one-dollar FM to
old-school APU busted off two pins off
that stuck them in the socket and it
didn't work still so this thing about
sticking pins in the socket on a m4 it
might not work as it didn't work for me
and I tried getting these pins in and
actually got them in perfectly I thought
but it didn't work in the end so if you
do want to put pins back on a rising CPU
that I'd recommend micro Sol during it's
something that I can't do personally I
don't have the gear at the moment and my
hands are pretty rough so you need to
have what I call surgeon hands in order
to perform this mod so in the end we did
manage to get the horizon 5 1400 working
though it wasn't a perfect fix I may try
in the future to get this thing working
again so if you guys have any
suggestions and be sure to drop them in
the comments section below however
before we get on to the next broken
parts in the list I'd like to give a big
shout out to today's video sponsor video
blocks with video blocks so you guys can
log on to the website download any of
their massive array of stock footage and
you can choose from that download and
put it in your videos and you don't have
to worry about copyright claims because
it's completely royalty free so if you
use the link video blocks comm slash
tech yes City underscore 0 9 1 7 then
you'll get a 7 day free trial the links
in the description below and with that
I've been using this service for
actually a couple of years now I use
some of their footage in countdowns I've
used some of their technology footage
and also that intro footage as well
that's been good when you get the
templates you can load them into After
Effects edit the colors and text to your
liking and you've now got an intro
that's
really cheap you don't have to go out
and source a professional company to
make you an intro and also with that you
can save a lot of time so great for
YouTube content creators for example or
people who have a company and they make
content for other companies and they are
on a budget to do some of their work
there's also a heap of different
categories to choose from in a free
7-day trial if you click the link in the
description below so nothing to lose and
with that let's get back to fixing those
broken PC parts so the next part we've
got up here is one that I was really
excited about when I went used PC parts
hunting in Japan I picked this up for
ten dollars as e68 Maximus gene from a
Zeus very expensive motherboard when it
was released new still expensive if
you've got one that works perfectly fine
to this date and when I saw it in the
stores everything physically checked out
except the two bent pins and I thought
I'd take the gamble on this and buy it
since two bent pins is pretty easy to
fix on LGA and now this time around I
got my trusty toothpick which is the
method that I do prefer and then bent
the two pins back in literally like five
seconds and the really good news was was
that after I did this it was working
absolutely fine now Daniel from Adelaide
on Facebook he sent me over AG 620 so I
could update the bass if need be so
thank you for sending that CPU and it
did work fine and also with that the
BIOS on this motherboard was actually
the latest revision to begin with so I
didn't have to update the BIOS I then
proceeded to test out a 2500 K which
James from Western Australia sent over
so big thank you as well for that and
that worked perfectly fine then I
decided to test the two CPUs that I
bought in Japan the 3770k which I got
for $100 and also the i3 3240 which I
got for around $25 I believe and both
these CPUs worked absolutely fine as
well now the next sample we've got up
here was Tim from New Zealand now Tim in
the past has sent me over a z87 X with a
4690k and unfortunately the motherboard
didn't work in that case but the i-5 did
so we managed to score an i-5 it did
work out in the end
it's a real big thank you to Tim this
time around is sent in a Zee 970 pros
three from asrock and also an FX 8350
and he says it just doesn't work he
wants me to test it out and upon
checking out the board physically it did
check out fine there was nothing that
looked wrong it physically checked out
okay there was no bad smells coming from
it and upon pulling off the CPU from the
socket I noticed that there was a little
bit of thermal paste in the socket
itself and now with this especially on
PGA sockets it's very not only dangerous
but it can stop a CPU motherboard combo
from working in this case there's two
different types of thermal paste that
generally can cause problems there's
actually three different types the third
which I recommend now a lot of the time
which is like mx4 it's non conductive
and non capacitive however a lot of
thermal paces out there are either
capacitive conductive or both now if you
use a capacitive thermal paste like
Arctic silver for example you do run the
risk of parts not working however you
usually don't have the risk of damaging
parts with a capacitive thermal paste
you'll just see that the product just
simply doesn't work because the bridging
power isn't strong enough to damage the
perspective parts however if you use a
conductive thermal paste that's where
you can run into some really big
problems things like liquid metal for
example if that bridges to different SM
DS together you can have some real big
problems not only damaging the part that
touches that but also parts that are
connected that too so be very careful
with conductive thermal paste however
this time around I believe capacitive
thermal paste was used because after I
cleaned up the socket with brake cleaner
and also the CPU itself the product was
then working fine this 970 pro 3
motherboard and the FX 8350 booted up
absolutely fine so next up we have
Vasily from Italy and big thank you for
this he sent over a z97
X gaming g1 motherboard and also at
4790k so that's a lot of money to send
us over man thank you a lot for that and
now he says this motherboard and CPU
worked perfectly fine and also after I
tested it out it did indeed work
perfectly fine now why do test these
parts out and I do recommend testing out
any used parts is because if you don't
and your then you do a use bill
them the amount of time you're going to
waste pulling all those parts out again
the frustrations you could have is well
worth that time just quickly testing it
out before you put it in the build so I
always recommend testing out use parts
before you use them in builds however
Vasily did have one request that I used
with his motherboard and that was to
test it out in battlefield one because
when he was using this motherboard and
CPU he was having problems with low
frame rates with a gtx 1080i so what i'm
gonna do in the future i'm gonna put
this in a build and then i'm going to
test it with battlefield one with a 1080
Ti I'm gonna overclock the memory
overclock that CPU and see if it does
indeed have stuttering problems or it
just can't simply handle a 1080 Ti which
I think of 4790k overclocked to around
4.8 gigahertz should handle a 1080 T I
absolutely fine and for the final part
to check out here today we had Jeffrey
from the US he sent over a GTX 970 from
EVGA this is the a CX 2.0 big thank you
he said this product works perfectly
fine he's just upgraded his graphics
card now to a 10 Series card so he
doesn't need the 970 anymore and when
looking at this thing it looked like it
was literally brand new so big thanks
Jeffrey I decided to quickly test it out
and lo and behold it worked perfectly
fine so I don't know man these parts
that are getting sent in a lot of them
are very expensive I may do a giveaway
PC for instance with the z97 XG one and
also this GTX 970 it's a lot to ask from
you guys I really appreciate this
support a lot guys it really does help
the channel however in ways I feel like
it's a little bit too much if you guys
want to jump on patron for example just
for a dollar a month you can support the
channel that way I mean sending over
parts that are worth like to $300 is a
big thank you but I probably will use
them for more charitable options because
I just feel a bit too greedy accepting
donations that big anyway that's about
it for today guys big thank you for
tuning in if you enjoyed this video - be
sure to hit that like button and let me
know in the comments section below
what was your favorite fixed part of
today I enjoyed fixing up all these
parts I thought that z68 motherboard was
actually my favorite it was just a quick
to
backs of the pins and it worked
perfectly fine after that
the risin 5 1400 that's still a little
bit of work in progress but at least it
does work maybe will be interesting to
test this out with single channel memory
on two channels that was actually
recognized so this is a really cool
thing a really unique thing maybe I can
turn it into a really interesting video
with double single channel memory versus
dual channel memory who knows but
anyways before I get on out here big
thank you to video blocks for sponsoring
out this video I'll put the link in the
description below you can get a 7 day
free trial awesome footage not just for
using for b-roll but also for using for
things like countdowns and you can even
download templates and make your own
intros for your own YouTube channel or
whatever content you want to do and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
