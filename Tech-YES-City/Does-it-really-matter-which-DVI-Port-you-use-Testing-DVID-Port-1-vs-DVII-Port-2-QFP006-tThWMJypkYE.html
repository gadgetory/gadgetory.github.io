Barone's coming back to you guys today
with an episode of quest for perfection
now I have not done one of these
episodes for a very long time and
basically what this series is is I
answer those anal-retentive questions of
is this better than that and today we're
going to be looking at mid-range to high
range graphics cards like your GTX 760
or GTX 780 and they usually have two DVI
ports on them so I'm going to look at if
you use one DVI port will it give you
better input lag than if you were to use
the other DVI port so let's move on now
to testing mythology then we'll move on
to the results and then we'll move on to
a conclusion so for testing methodology
I have two monitors set up both off the
DVI ports one is an ASA 1080p TN panel
the other is an IPS ya mikaze ebay
special now I stopped the IPS panel down
to 1080p and then I duplicated the
displays and then I opened three
instances of input lag Exe and then I
used my DSLR stop down to one four
thousandth of a second and take a few
series of shots and I checked the
results from there so the first test we
run the ASA was plugged into the bottom
DVI port and the IPS panel was plugged
into the DVI port at the top so the Acer
in Windows it referred to this as DVI
port 1 and the IPS panel was referred to
as DVI 2 now when we did this we saw
that the ASA was actually 10 to 20
milliseconds faster than the IPS panel
and this kind of surprised me because I
didn't realize that this ASA panel was
this damn good wow this is like a four
or five year old monitor and it performs
like one of the best monitors you can
get so I'll talk a little bit more about
this in the conclusion but on average
when we had the ASA in DVI port 1 and
the IPS panel in DVI port 2 the ASA
performed about 10 to 20 milliseconds
faster than the IPS panel now this is
inherent now what we have to remember is
is that the IPS essentially the TN panel
the ASA 10 panel is faster than the IPS
panel the monitor itself so when we test
the monitor we're going to be looking
for either smaller or bigger differences
so let's move on now to the second set
of results
so for the second set of results we then
reversed it we had the IPS panel in the
bottom DVI port or DVI port 1 and then
we plug the ASA TN panel in DVI port two
of the top DVI port panel and when we
did this we saw that the results were I
guess roughly the same I mean the IPS
panel was about ten again about 10 to 20
milliseconds slower than the TN panel
the ASA 10 however it was I thought
honestly I would love to do more testing
because I thought it was if anything
slightly faster when I used when I did
this test when I ran the second test
with the IPS and DVI port one I thought
it was just only a little bit behind in
some circumstances it wasn't as slow as
when it was switched around so with that
being said let's move on now to the
conclusion so in conclusion I mean there
wasn't much I can't really conclusively
say that using one DVI port is better
than the other
however if I mean I'd have to do more
experimentation on it I'd love to get a
camera that stopped down even further
maybe one a thousandth of a second and
I'd love to maybe take a thousand shots
and then compare it but in my gut
feeling honestly that I'll tell you my
gut feeling and it does my gut says that
using DVI port one or using the bottom
DVI port is actually better than using
the top DVI port or DVI port 2 so if
you're a gamer and you want to get the
best response times possible and you've
got maybe in a Zeus that has like 1
milliseconds input lag and you don't
know which DVI port to use then I
suggest using DVI port one or the bottom
DVI port on your graphics card so you've
got the fan here and it's plugged into
your motherboard then use the one down
the bottom that's just my my thinking
I'd have to do more conclusive evidence
to test but my gut says that this is
ever so slightly faster than the top DVI
port anyway hope you guys enjoyed this
one thing if you did please give it a
thumbs up and if you haven't read
subscribe particular city where I'd do
all kinds of nerdy tech videos like this
because I love answering these questions
for myself as much as I answer them for
you and it's actually funny because in
hindsight I was using DVI port 2 for my
IPS panel but now I'm going to be using
DVI port one for my IPS panel since I
predominantly gaming off this panel now
and I use it for everything because
1440p is just awesome but yes in a
nutshell I was actually really surprised
at how good the Acer TN panel was as
well I mean wow it's a five-year-old
panel that was literally got this thing
for like less than $200 back in the day
and it was always funny because I
wondered why I got like I think I got to
1900 in Heroes of Newerth
back when it was a bit more popular and
then I switched over I bought my hundred
and twenty Hertz Samsung and my rating
dropped and I always wondered why my
rating dropped but now I know why
because of the input lag the Samsung had
worse input lay than the IPS panel and
the IPS panel has worse the input lag
than the Acer TN so I was really shocked
I was really surprised at how good the
response times were on the ace of 10
panels so I'm going to say if you're on
a budget and you're a competitive gamer
then you might want to think about
getting an ace 1/10 panel that's all I'm
going to say out of this testing anyway
so that's about it guys I hope you
enjoyed this video and if you have any
questions or comments please leave a
comment in the comment section below and
I will catch you guys with another tech
video very shortly and you a piece out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
