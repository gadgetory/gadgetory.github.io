PC parts hunting and last month we just
came up with a couple of good deals I
was scared that was probably like the
first month we almost came close to
coming empty-handed with getting no
deals so at the moment the current state
of the market is pretty bad
cryptocurrency is still selling out
those new gravis cards and with that
people are like damn I don't want to
build a new computer because the prices
of new parts are just so expensive
between the new gravis cards and the new
ddr4 memory it's created this weird
market even in Australia the price of a
1050 Ti for example has gone up as well
so it's getting a little bit scary at
the moment to the point where everyone's
like dude I want to go on gumtree find
some deals or I want to buy a used PC
off gum tree that represents really good
value for money now because the price of
a new PC is so expensive but I've got my
new aircon as well it's actually really
cold in here at the moment so I'm going
to turn it off and then we're going to
pull up some deals and see what we can
find
so now the first day were pulled up
behind me is a GTX 780 and now the
performance of these is really good
especially when you compare it to us
1050 TI which is $300 this performs
better of course it does use more power
but it's coming close to a GTX 1063
gigabyte and those are pretty hard to
find as well so if we can bargain this
guy and he just lives around the corner
from me if we can bargain him down to
say a hundred and thirty dollars from
two hundred I know it's a little bit
lowball but if we can get him down to
that level then we'll have a good deal
so let's give him a call see what we can
do and get your hustle on but this month
I'm gonna do things a little bit
different because every month people
like dudes stop putting on a different
accent just go with your normal accent
so that's exactly what I'm gonna do this
month hey Dylan how are you mate yeah
not bad I just saw you got an ad on
gumtree here for a GTX 780 yeah how much
would you what's the last you go on it
alright guys just yeah I mean I cuz I
live around the corner I live up in
Harlem Park so you live in tower now
come pick it up today if you want to
[Laughter]
yeah I picked up a couple a couple of
months ago for 120-130
yeah I mean the market the markets gone
a bit towards the seller but you know if
you want 140 cash man I'll come pick it
up later today no it's good take it tell
you to not fight so there's the first
deal there and it kind of fell through
in my opinion just by the sound of his
voice like usually I'll get back to you
doesn't sound too keen I'm going for 140
I'm trying to hustle as low as possible
it is a GTX 780 it is used 140 is a
pretty decent price 150 s of just you
know that $10 threshold makes it kind of
not worth it
and of course this is what I was trying
to say maybe if I put on that bogan
accent I could have got that deal so we
can't turn back the clock now we can't
find out if the bogan would have got
that but the normal voice failed but
let's try some other deals so last month
we pulled up this deal beside me this
was the guy selling the broken PC and
we're gonna offer I think it was like
450 or 400 so the ad is still up there
and it's now for 500 bucks so I'm gonna
try and give the guy another call like I
think I tried a few times last month I
mean hopefully answers his phone but
we'll see if he'll take 400 that'll be
not bad considering he's got a GTX 970
in there hey Josh how are you mate yeah
just you got an ad off your gum tray for
a PC that looks like it's broken down
you still have it yeah how much do you
want for it yeah okay it's just yeah I
got cash on me Matt come through maybe
if you're willing to take say for say
four hundred and thirty bucks or
something then I can swing by yours pick
it up Oh like I can come pick it up
today man with cash no I then take it
easy see it so that was another deal
that kind of maybe will fall through I'm
gonna wait a few hours and see if both
Dylan and Josh will get back to us but
for 30 I kind of opted it from 400
because he was in that state of fly
he was pretty firm on his price i could
sell the tone in the manner of his voice
as soon as he said 500 he wasn't really
gonna budge that much so for 30 s kind
of like even those a little bit lower
it's still not 400 I said 400 he would
have probably just like immediately hung
up the phone so these are for 30 you
sign up you're kind of saying look I'll
come pick it up today easy come wipe it
off your hands he knows my number so
hopefully we get that deal so next time
we're pulled up here as a gtx 680 and
the sellers actually got two of them and
the Zeus one and a gigabyte one and they
want a hundred negotiable for each of
them or they want a hundred seventy-five
for both I think we could probably get
them down to 150 for the pair and at
that price for two gtx 680 s it's not a
bad deal i could maybe do an SLI build
in 2018 with two gtx 680 s and see how
they fare but let's give this a ring and
see how they go I'm really not liking
the normal voice I want to do the bogan
but this month will let us know for sure
if the bogan needs to come back okay hey
Chris how are you mate yeah not bad
I'm just looking on gumtree you've got
an ad up here for a GTX 680 can you
still have that or you said you got two
of them which one did you sell the okay
so give I haven't seen a photo that you
guys pulled up these this one is a
gigabyte one the has three fans on it
okay yeah I'm sure you're on the coast
year first Lake all of the play is the
card it is the card on the coaster that
southern forest like there might be
someone else in the buy it I'm just oh
okay no worries yeah I was just gonna
throw
eighty cash your way if you want and I
could come pick it up yeah well if this
other guy doesn't work out oh you know
it yeah it might be um so sorry no no
worries mate no ice all right well
thanks very Chris see that plate okay so
anyway that's looking like it's another
deal that possibly has fallen through so
the next month I am bringing back the
bogan 110 percent so the next deal we're
pulling up here is a PC for 500
Australian dollars so basically one
Australian dollar is weaker than an
American dollar so it'd be like 400 us
if that it's a whole PC that says it has
an i7 in it so 8 gigabytes of RAM and
it's got a gtx 1060 and a hard drive
motherboard all that stuff this is a
no-brainer at 500 bucks I mean I might
even just say look what's your lowest
price and go pick it up for that price
because that's an extremely good deal as
it is but yeah I mean even if we go pick
it up and it's like at everything's
toast I think the GTX 1060 alone might
even be worth the money but I'm keen to
see what the loss they'll go on that is
can almost smell a deal my sense of
smell must be quite bad because clearly
I can't smell a deal so next do we got
up here is a quickie it's just a our
seven three sixty two gigabytes so
they're asking seventy strain dollars
I'm gonna say we put in a conservative
offer of $45 so next seller we've pulled
up here has a lot of different pcs for
sale they've got ice
Evans 26 hundreds the old Sandy Bridge
I think they've even got LGA 1156 as
well that's the gen before that so if I
can say look maybe if you give us a 20%
discount because he's already got pretty
decent prices and we get a 20% discount
maybe we'll just like buy a heap of
different computers from this guy that's
good no King he does take a discount if
I'm gonna buy a heap of them he's got
literally like five computers that I'd
like to buy so hopefully this one works
out remember all we need is one good
deal and it would have all been worth it
hello is this les yeah can you hear us
mate I saw you you may you've got a heap
of ads on gumtree here for a lot of
different pcs I was thinking like
because the i7 2670 s like I love all
those old parts man like if I was to say
buy like five of those off you could you
do us a little discount like 20% of
something probably 20% 20% is from a
hundred to a do could probably give you
100 to 90 or 85 maybe on you know like
that type of just killing someone yeah
yeah I was gonna buy father's and mafia
mater so I'll sayin cash I can't pick it
up today if you can okay um yeah so I'll
let you I'll I'll give you I'll send you
text with all the PCs that I'm keen to
pick up and they're all work okay great
okay okay cool sweet I'll say I see you
can't if i buy like five of it I think
you've pulled up five listings here I'd
be keen to pick up five of them couldn't
go 20% all right 15 percents the best
you'll do yeah 15% sounds good mags you
already got pretty good prices on them
so
I know I know don't worry I'm just you
know you always got to go for a little
bit more greedy than you alright I'll
text you over all the PCs that I'm keen
for and then you know just grab get them
ready and if he could takes us back
around
all right let's thanks mate okay Brian
okay thanks mate wait okay success all
right so we got five pcs we're gonna
score now four pretty good prices I'm
gonna team up all the PCs that I'm keen
on he's agreed to go 15% off I'm happy
with that since his prices are already
really good all's we have to do with a
lot of these machines technically is
take out even the components if their HP
motherboards we just get rid of the HP
motherboard get an Aliexpress
motherboard in but those i7 2670 if you
couple them with 1050 TI's or 780 S or
whatever graphics cards are gonna have
coming through these computers are gonna
be ready to go so that's an awesome deal
we'll deals all in one I spoke too soon
it's up to you guys if you want to see
the bogan come back or not so I just
sent the text message through then I've
got about a thousand Australian dollars
for 6 pcs so they'd be around like 780
US dollars incredible if we can actually
pick up this deal and put it in the car
but what we've got behind me is the last
deal here this is for a small
form-factor HP machine now I've dealt
with small form-factor HP machines in
the past and they have been problematic
especially the ones with I threes in
them
this has an i5 2500 but they're asking a
hundred sixty-seven dollars so we're
gonna drop in an offer of $100.00 and
just tell them like look it's a gamble
because if we put a grafts card in
there's no guarantee it'll work but even
in a hundred dollars if it doesn't the
grants car doesn't work we'll be able to
swap the motherboard for a mini h61 and
we'll still have a gaming PC because the
i5 2500 and eight gigabytes of RAM is
worth a hundred Australian bucks in my
opinion but let's give that guy a call
now so I just refreshed my browser and
this PC literally saw
so I didn't even get time to put in an
offer
so we just got back home now it's pretty
dark but on the way home I also managed
to pick up this from cash converters so
always on the hustle always in the grind
they said it was a 78 70 but it's
actually a 78 50 so I ended up getting
it for $25 bargain and it comes with a
three month warranty but we'll test it
out pretty soon let's take a look at
this massive hole that we got here so
here it is here we picked up six
computers packed with i7 si fives memory
hard drives power supplies cases and
this is what it's all about this case
here actually looks really good too this
is a gigabyte simplistic case but we're
gonna Chuck a graphics card in this one
make a gaming pc out of it and maybe
even chuck in this $25 card because I
think we've already got to build there
for the PC of the month and I also
managed to pick up the 22 inch monitor
because I've actually got a need for
this with the new stream that's going
down this monitor is gonna be perfect
for the subject the co-host and then
I'll use those two 24 inch monitors over
there I actually get a new monitor arm
for them and stack them on top of each
other so that'll be the streaming set up
there and wow this is just what it's all
about Liz was such a good guy too he
armed
he's just man he's got a garage just
packed full of PCs I was shocked but how
many pcs he had there he said like look
put me on speed dial if you need
computers I'm your hookup and so that's
exactly what I'm gonna do I'm gonna be
given Blair's a call I think every month
now Rick also got back to me about the
GTX 1060 machine that was going for five
hundred Ozzie and he was pretty firm on
that price he knew it was worth what it
was with the memory in the GTX 1060 and
I kind of inquired I said look what I
seven is in there because it's like an
i7 870 which I suspect it is in a OAM
motherboard it's not really that good of
a pickup and so I tried bogging him down
to 430 he said he'd get back to me but
he never did so I think the market at
the moment is a little bit in that stage
of its a bit of a seller's market
especially with this cryptocurrency
kind of miss it the Old Market where you
just snap up all them bargains but if
you're on your hustle and you're on your
grind you're gonna be getting them deals
don't worry brothers but also on the
table here is the Obsidian I just did
the review on that so hope you guys
enjoyed that we're gonna be definitely
testing out that one and motherboard and
we've got one video now left on the
backlog this is the QNAP Nass this is
gonna be the tech yes NASA we're gonna
set up so the backlog is almost finished
and when that backlog is finished
there's gonna be much more of this
coming on the channel so make sure you
stay tuned but let's test this graphics
card out and also another request from
you guys was to test out that r9 280 and
try and flash a new BIOS on it so I'm
gonna give one more chance to that r9
290 102 80 sorry before I throw it in
the bin or get rid of it alright so this
got here it's doing the exact same thing
as the other graphics card did when you
get the windows and you install the
driver it then just clunks out so I'm
really got to figure this out I'm gonna
spend a little bit of time
troubleshooting this so first of all I'm
gonna what we're gonna do here is we're
gonna flash a new BIOS onto this and
then what we can actually do is use a
previous boss from a direct see you too
but it's gonna have lower clock speeds
so this one's this one's the not the top
Edition so you can see that it's got a
different cooler but it's got lower
clock speed so gonna try flash this on
to the r9 280 first door first of all
and see if it works and then we might
have to do the same thing to that if it
does work so this is the second time now
we're flashing the BIOS the first time
it made it to windows and Driver install
and then it crashed out completely this
time we're trying a different boss yet
again and then we'll try it one more
time so we'll restart the computer if
this doesn't work then we'll try like a
default ati or AMD bios for the y r9
290x so i 280x and my wife keeps saying
290x but probably I wish I had a 290x
instead of a 280x but we'll try a final
BIOS after this one if this doesn't work
and then yeah I'm giving up on it
because it's just it's too much of a
hassle like I'll be here for it might be
able to figure out what it is but I'll
easily spend over a day just trying to
diagnose and seeing if I can get it to
work I mean it could just be a new
driver that the problem is related to
like maybe Windows 10 and the latest AMD
driver or something and maybe a legacy
driver works but yeah it'll take me ages
to figure it out and of course you can't
have automatic updates on just one
updates a new driver it'll it'll just
clunk out so here's look it makes it to
the BIOS okay completely makes it to the
BIOS fine everything looks okay and then
it makes the window just clunks out so
hmm okay so I tried the original on line
two ATX boss didn't work and we saw now
that I put a 7970 BIOS on it and we got
an error this time around that was crazy
because it came out with an error but
you may have noticed that there was
stripes going through it and we'll try
and replicate it again but there was
these sort of like yeah it was like as
if something was wasn't able to run up
those clock speeds so what we might have
here is a severely degraded r9 280x and
if that's the case what we'll have to do
is go in and edit a manual bios so see
here see those dots there there so we'll
probably have to go in and edit a bios
and really drop the clock speeds down so
far that it might be able to work again
so that is the last attempt I'm gonna do
I tried a BIOS custom bus with a much
higher TDP power limit and also a much
lower clock on the memory and core and
yeah it's still clunking out guys I
really don't have any idea what is wrong
with this card and I'm honestly just fed
up wasting time with it so let's just
try this one maybe this one can breathe
some new hope so there's the graphics
card there and it is performing
absolutely fine so that previous r9 280x
might have jinxed the whole system but
this
card solo is working absolutely fine and
the numbers confirm that it is indeed a
7850 because we've got the fire strike
here up on the website this is taxi dot
TV we've got the whole list of all those
fire strikes cause we see how 7870 is
doing 6220 points
7850 is doing 5,200 points so there it
is February's used pc parts hunt we got
the deals we got them and we got some
really good prices on this six pieces of
systems the other deals as well the guys
didn't really end up getting back to me
the r7 360 I think the guy did get back
to me and he was okay with 45 bucks but
I just said - text me the address and
he's like I've got no reception or
something I was just I mean I then
picked up that 7850 which i think is a
better deal for $25.00 so I was happy
with that I mean I might get the r7 360
I'm just not too keen after getting that
other graphics card so I will be on the
hunt for some more grabs cards the other
guys didn't get back to me so I'm not
gonna be pursuing those deals I'm not
gonna bother with it the Rick guy did
get back to me as I said before but
again he was pretty firm on 500 but
another thing is - if these guys do get
back to me in the next day then I'm
going to lower my offers because
generally with deals hunting you put in
your offer and it's usually an
on-the-spot thing because a lot of these
guys I think that will get a few offers
in they'll wait a week on it and then
they'll see which one's the best offer
and then they'll get back to that guy
and be like yeah you can still have it
for this price they're generally in
Australia with deals hunting and even a
lot of other guys deal hunting - they're
not like that as well we're like look
this is our price and if you don't give
us an answer straight away then if you
come back to us we're gonna lower our
offer again because chances are we've
already found something else so that's
generally how it goes with deer hunting
in Australia so if these guys do get
back to me which i think they will after
a day or two then yeah the offers are
gonna go even low but I'll report back
in the description if I do get those
deals or maybe in next month's part hunt
but stay tuned for the use build and if
you enjoyed this parts on sure to hit
that like button also for next month
let us know what axe
you guys want because the normal accent
it did work this month when I met up
with less he appreciated that I wasn't a
crazy guy said that to me he's like look
you're not crazy and I appreciate that
and he said you know he's telling me
about how many crazy guys he gets on
gumtree inquiring about ads so his tell
me about one guy wanted him wanted him
to drop a laptop at the airport he was
like no way so let me know in the
comment section below most upvoted
comment will be next month's accent so
stay tuned for that and i'll catch you
in another tech video very soon
