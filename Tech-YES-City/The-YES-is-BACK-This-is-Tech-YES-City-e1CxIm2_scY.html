brian coming to you guys today with a
200,000 subscriber thank you and i just
can't thank you guys enough you've been
with me through thick and thin and if
you're wondering if you're new to the
channel it's gone from tech yes city
originally to tech city and then now
back to tech yes city again and what i
think back on it i really don't know why
i changed it from tech a city to tech
city to begin with i think may be going
more professional with something that i
wanted to focus on at the time but then
i realized you know especially i spoke
to a lot of people and they just said
look dude that's who you are don't try
to be someone that you're not and i
listen to that voice and it's right it's
like man i'm the guy who just grabs pc
pops you know and just doesn't really
care and just make something out of
nothing i guess that's what i am it what
i do it you guys love it as well so i'm
just going to keep giving you guys the
content that you love and i'm just going
to keep having fun while i make these
videos and also on that note we've got
some really cool announcements i'm going
to be cleaning up this power supply in
this video my friend gave me this he
said it was a cursed power supply and
that it was blowing up his a motherboard
and CPU and he said it even blew up a
hard drive but I just think this power
supply honestly needs just a good
hose-down with a pressure washer and
then a good hair drying and then some
wd-40 to rid all the water that's still
in there and then we'll see if it boots
up on my server motherboard
they're now opening up this power play
it is extremely dirty now this house why
haven't been turned on in at least 10
months so there's pretty much no charge
we missed our flight and I seriously do
not recommend ever opening up a power
supply so guys don't do as I do just
watch as I do now why straight towards
us after 2 km long now watch my
shoulders back
this is that night-night
like if there's at night
these are looking all over for you
so it's finally time for the moment of
truth and we've got here a server grade
motherboard this is quite a few years
old and I use this generally for testing
our power supplies because it's built
really well it turns on automatically
though it may not give out a signal due
to me not having any ECC memory at the
moment so however it should still boot
up and it should still be able to tap
down the power supply now a lot of
people be like why are you using this
and not a power supply tester I actually
just like to go the authentic way and
you know see if it works and see if
nothing's being blown up so there is a
signal there I believe that's to the
memory so I have to kind of try and find
some ECC memory but the good news is is
the power supply is booting up it's not
killing anything and I think we're good
to go so the power supply is working
like brand-new or at least it seems to
be so I look forward to bringing that in
a build in the near future and also on
other news some other cool videos to hit
the channel will be this sort of LGA 771
CPU with an rx 560 to see the
performance and how well that performs
in modern titles and also the Corsair 1
I'm going to be reviewing that and
checking that out for you guys and will
of course be overclocking it and taking
it apart
I may even delive the CPU which I'm sure
I'm not supposed to do but yeah and also
for the full use price performance
enthusiasts out there I will be having a
used build hitting the channel that uses
a fixed core phenom and also a gtx 770
so we'll see how well those go once i've
overclocked them and also what about
giveaways will in the next few weeks I'm
going to be teaming up with fellow
youtubers homegrown box 2 has just hit a
hundred thousand subscribers so big
congratulations to him and also science
studios and we're going to be teaming up
and giving away a PC each and it's going
to be international and completely free
to enter so stay tuned and you can
follow us on Twitter or Instagram for
more updates on when exactly this
giveaway will be starting and Finn
and also before I get on out of here I
want to give each and every one of you a
big thank you just thanks so much for
your support
I've been through a lot IRL in the last
couple of years it's been really hard
but the channel has been the one thing
and you guys have been one thing that's
just kept me going through all these
good bad times
so thanks heaps and I look forward to
giving you guys another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye and yeah also
I'm a little bit sick of the month
they're just going to keep on grinding
