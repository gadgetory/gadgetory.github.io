I'd do it like a vlog where I'm putting
together a $20 PC
that's right $20
welcome back to tokyo city ladies and
gentlemen's brian coming back you guys
live in some little vlog where i've just
picked up this junk pc for $20 so I'm
pretty much cleaning it down at the
moment with some 556 cic absolutely like
this stuff and man it was an absolute
mess before but it's some red max case
it came with three fans I even think
they're LEDs so that's that and then up
here we've got a Q I should pull this
outside cuz it's light we've got a q9
550 which came with it as well so yeah
for 20 dollars i'll surprises like these
guys clearly didn't know what pc parts
are worth so inside we have as well in a
zeus motherboard which i'll just pull
out for you guys I'm going to Zeus
motherboard now clean this down as well
so that's with CRC 556 I've cleaned all
that down that's good to go and even
came with a 600 watt power supply like
you know I've cleaned this down too as
well but so for 20 dollars we've got a
600 watt power supply a motherboard the
q9 550 a junk intel heat sink fan a raid
max case and then we've got in here four
gigabytes of ddr2 memory so I was kind
of shocked I mean this is really good
especially if someone wanted to build a
real budget PC because I got a GT 9 740
upstairs I think it is 740 I'm not too
sure I have to check that I've got a
real budget graphics card upstairs as
well so I'm going to pair it with this
I've even got a 750 gigabyte like just
hard drive that I pulled out of a laptop
so I'm just going to see if I can put
something together for $20 and post on
the results now keep in mind though that
there is a big risk that these parts
won't work at all so since it was
labeled as junk but I've got a feeling
it'll work I mean I've cleaned it all
down now that does look pretty damn good
so we're going to use you know it's
going to go into actually one thing
can show you is the is the IR shield so
that's it even came with the IO shield
as well so just put that on the CPU you
know it's no problems so it's going to
work it's going to work anyway guys
let's move on to the next part where I
put this all together and we're going to
whack a graphics card in their hard
drive and see if it fires up here's a
look at how dirty it was before so
here's the head sink fan and it's just
like almost antiqued so really filthy so
we used to get this stuff and you just
spray it down now you can just like grab
that spray it down you know wipe off the
heatsink paste that comes off pretty
easy
and then you just can grab a brush now
I'm doing this with one hand so so this
is how easy it is to clean your computer
parts you know like no bull no bull like
this will actually come up pretty well
yeah take a look at that anyone want a
roasted pizza for breakfast so there's
the after so it looks a little bit
cleaner than it did before so yeah now
these folks were even nice enough to
include a DVD rewritable as well so this
$20 man I'm extracting some value out of
it we're about to start the build and
this input/output shield is like
completely wrong and the top two ports
they're in the back they're like PC a
sorry ps2 ports you see this one doesn't
even have two ps2 ports but anyway the
builds mostly ready to go in so I'm just
doing some little prep changes here and
then I'm going to install it all
oh yeah look at that we're gonna do some
b-roll on this jungle sandwich fellas so
there it is I haven't even bothered
doing any cable management I just really
want to see if it works at the moment
and then we can pretty much just yeah I
mean I actually don't know the power
switch and reset switch configurations
so what I'm going to do is just kind of
guess and then see if it boots up by
pressing either one just sort of like
yeah troubleshoot that because this
actual motherboard it even though it
looks pretty decent it actually doesn't
have a model name on it so I can't find
a model number anywhere I mean that's
before I covered it with jungle cable
but anyway let's try and boot it up and
see if it works
here's the moment you guys have all been
waiting for I am going to boot this
thing up and see if it turns on so
fingers crossed if I got the power
switch right so okay alrighty
even though the power button is on this
case
okay nothing the light on the
motherboards on so hopefully I can
rework the power switches down there and
see if one of those is the actual power
switch yeah that's not I got to rework
the power switch up down there
okay sorry hope the power switch up and
it's booting up whoa
if this 20 dollar PC is working this I
can't believe this holy crap that's
that's insane like the I mean even like
the fans are working to even though
they're really weak like wow this is
like the weakest fans I've ever seen in
my life they just don't like they're
blowing like nowhere that's weak
but anyway the computer is still
initializing so I mean it boots up which
means the CPU the RAM I guess
everything's working I think there just
might be a problem with it so I probably
have to diagnose what's going on
with this and then I can try and get it
to boot so we'll just play around with
it I mean I might jump in the bass
because I could go to the BIOS before
and then we'll see if it works okay so
the problem we got now is is this stuck
on this screen where it's saying
initializing but interestingly enough
this memory stick when it has this one
in only it doesn't boot but when it has
this one in it does boot which would
mean that it's most likely a memory
problem and that the memory might not be
compatible or it's just that it needs
your voltage I'm not too sure and so
it's just not working properly with said
conditions so what I'm going to try to
do now is I don't know I mean I might
last-ditch attempt I might
pulling off these blue because it's got
these over vault settings and I might
just try to pull these pins off and see
if it buds if not I might just run down
to a secondhand junk store and grab like
a ddr2 stick of memory and try another
stick and you know if the motherboard
does work it's always a good thing if
you can salvage it just it seems like
these something's going on with the
memory here in terms with the
motherboard so that's why it's not
booting up but anyway we'll get more
progress on that soon all right so we
went to the store today and I've got a
different computer this one this one's
$10 so it came with two sticks of 512
megabytes of ddr2 memory so I'm going to
put these sticks in and see if they are
compatible with our little junk rig over
there there's a towel in the way but we
will see if it works so we'll clean this
up a little bit I mean this was filthy
as well so I will clean it up and then
put the RAM in and see if it fires up if
it doesn't fire up then I'm just going
to say it's the motherboard because I
know the power supply works and if this
if it was the CPU honestly it probably
wouldn't even start so that's that so
anyway we'll give it a shot we'll clean
this Ram up and put it in ok so we've
put the last stick of memory in and like
I've tried everything I've tried every
single slot of RAM I've tried this that
no no I've just tried if you haven't
even tried bashing the motherboard so
it's pretty much a dead motherboard
though there's good news is that the CPU
does work and I'm pretty sure all the
memory works as well so what I'm going
to do now is pretty much sell the all
the individual parts and probably bin
the rest of that so I'll probably been
all that stuff I mean sorry bin the
motherboard and just kit so all the
other little pie
hats off so in the end I did get a q95
50 and a 600 watt power supply and a
half decent case for 20 bucks though I
did waste another $10 on this thing here
this piece of junk here so I did waste
20 bucks on this I mean sorry 10 dolls
all I was thirty dollars and I do get
four gigabytes of ddr2 memory as well so
well 1l it was okay it's just I was
hoping that this motherboard would work
I was really hoping there's not a little
work and it didn't but anyway guys you
wanted to see the vlogs win or lose I'm
gonna show everything so this is holdup
alright so I was just about done I had
edited the video everything got it
already and then we went out to some
more stores to hunt my brother's hunting
for retro games and they like secondhand
stores that just sell a lot of cheap
stuff and so I saw this this was like as
funny this was advertised as a core to
George just a dual core no hard drive
they're like 10 bucks
and I pulled off the side panel and I
saw an AMD motherboard on okay what's
going on here so yeah the motherboard
looks really good I haven't cleaned this
or anything and then I pulled the
heatsink off and it's like phantom 2 I'm
like wow that's a quad core so you know
I caught these boys slipping up big-time
or I don't know whatever maybe they just
finished a mega fap session or whatever
but then they slipped up ten dollars and
I got all this here so we're going to
give this one more shot now the catch
here is that this heat sink is broken so
the clips actually broken but if it does
work if it does boot up and everything's
okay then you can see that silicon gun
there I'm actually going to do something
I've never done before and if it all
does work then I'm going to kind of just
pretty much just silicon gun the
heatsink down and that pretty much means
that I'm never going to be pulling this
heatsink off will this be off again but
doesn't matter because there's a ten
dollar PC and I just want it to work
we've got the other parts up here this
is the there's another four-year arts of
ddr2 memory and then video graphs cards
like a nothing card but whatever if it
works it'll be cool like I just want to
put together a cheap PC and then we like
250 gigabyte hard drive so fingers
crossed that this does work so I'm
really hoping it does work so let's fire
it up let's see if it works ok the
moment of truth you've all been waiting
for I've hooked it all up and we've got
the keyboard and mouse ready you've got
HDMI the TV's on TV's like yep give me a
signal so let's let's try this okay well
it's like the power supply it's letting
off this high-pitched noise this this
doesn't sound good already okay turn it
on no turns on which is cool let's see
if we can get a signal come on stop me
as it's turning on the power button
worked okay come on
I got on the right one HDMI should be
HDMI one okay we've got nothing so far
there's no signal coming out of this so
it could be the HDMI ports faulty or
something since I don't or it could be
where three four three
like you know I already gone through two
of these computers the last one the ten
last $10 one at ball went up in smoke
they literally smoke pop down to the
other leg damn so this looks like it's
three for three but I'm going to try and
do is I'll try and switch some parts
over now switch the RAM over change the
power supply even put that graphics card
in and see if we can get a signal out of
it because you know the motherboard and
the CPU are the main parts that I want
to work and if they work and we've got a
PC so I'll try and work some things and
see if we can get something working out
of this fingers are still crossed
okay so upon pulling off this power
connected to the CPU you can see that
it's like fried like and that I mean it
looks like it's the power supply that's
at fault since I guess someone probably
let you know probably install the
computer and just How to Lose connect oh
that's what it looks like so I'm going
to put another power play in and see if
this will fire up but that's definitely
the problem there so that's scary I've
never seen that before so anyway just be
careful this is lit I guess the lesson
to come out of this is make sure your
harnesses are connected properly so
anyway let's try and fix this PC all
right so we've got another power supply
rigged up here we've got CPU just sort
of sitting there the cooler sitting
there doing nothing but sitting on the
CPU and we've got one stick of RAM so if
this doesn't boot up then nothing will
that means the model it's pretty much
dead so we'll give this a shot so we've
got no more whining
but uh oh yeah I need a screwdriver now
just use a USB port here to show the
pins okay let's see if we can get a
signal whoa okay whoa whoa I'm put that
work in the wind no problems it works
okay so what's the power supply's I
thought the high-pitched whine that
could have been the power supply and I
was pretty much right though I do worry
about that connector still but this is
definitely some good news that it's
booting up and it's giving me a signal
so pretty much so we are trying yeah
like try and work with this now so yeah
I'm gonna actually put it in a case now
and try and set it up that's actually
really good news and if it boots up then
this would have all been for something
this whole three junk rigs man that's
like I don't know I feel like I've
climbed Mount Everest with one leg or
something
no all right so with a silicon gund the
heat sink down here so I do not
recommend any of this at doing any of
this at home so silicon it down now
it is technically I can get the CPU a
low so once this dries would probably
take a few hours once it dries if I do
want to pull the CPU out I can actually
just get a Stanley knife and cut the
links so yeah but anyway I just thought
I'd give it a go so the motherboard does
work I'm pretty sure at this stage it'll
all work so once this is dried up I'll
then start putting it into that $20 ring
case and we will hook it all up and then
put a hard drive in put six gigabytes of
ddr2
to memory in there and we'll hopefully
have a PC for like under $40 so I'm
hoping at this stage
all right so here's the heat sink in the
morning and you can see here it's firmly
attached to the motherboard now so it
did work the silicon did work so now
it's time to put this motherboard in the
case and screw it off and put the RAM in
hook up the power and let's see if we
can get it to work 100%
you
alright so the computer is finally up
and running I did have some problems
with these solder connections there
mainly the USB boot it wouldn't boot off
a USB device so I had to pull off an old
CD and I've got a spare Windows 7 copy
lying around so I thought hey I'll
install that and it's working like
everything is legitimately working I'm
surprised it's got 6 gigabytes of ddr2
memory in there and it's also got a
phantom 2 quad quad core processor at
kodkod I'm playing too much Call of Duty
lately but it's got a core quad core CPU
in there the phantom 2 940 so anyway
that being said this the whole thing
cost me $40 and I think we need to move
over to a conclusion because there's a
lot that needs to be spoken about with
this
sanal here we are with a PC that works I
was really surprised at the same time I
was really happy because I built a
quad-core phantom to AMD build with six
gigabytes of ddr2 memory for $40.00 now
we pull the power supply out of the
first bill which worked fine and then we
pulled out other parts and replace them
and we got a working PC and everything
is good mind you I did put a 250
gigabyte Seagate hard drive in there but
honestly you could probably pick up
second in hard drive for ten dollars and
I did put a graphics card in there
that's really lackluster but if you were
to put something like a 650 Ti boost in
here or something that's pretty cheap
you can have yourself a pretty cheap
gaming rig for $100 now obviously there
are risks right I could have ran the
risk of everything not working
completely since it was junk parts but
when I did inspect them at the hardware
store before I bought them I kind of had
an inkling of what would work and what
wouldn't work especially when I saw this
AMD motherboard I thought wow that's
pretty much going to work and I was
right even though I got lucky in that
that motherboard wasn't blown out with
that burnt-out connection there though
keep in mind though the connection is
firmly connected I've made sure that's
now firmly connected so nothing
shouldn't be too dangerous some people
may think of this as a fire hazard but
it's working fine the CPU is secured
down by silicon so it's a little bit
ghetto but at the end of the day I've
got a PC that works
and I've got these spare parts as well
so I got a q9 550 that I pulled from the
first build and that will probably sell
for around about $80 I've also got a
core to joy which is like $5.00 and then
I've got a spare sooo gigabytes of ddr4
memory so all in all i'm i've built a PC
here today and I'm probably going to net
like $50 profit off it too so it's a lot
of fun though honestly if you're tech
savvy would this be worth your time I
would say yes and no for me it was
because I had a lot of fun also there
was a lot of frustrating moments but
ultimately it all worked out and I guess
that's why it made it all worth it
though if it didn't work out I'd
probably be doing a different
recommendation which is kind of stupid
but don't worry anyway I'm just happy
that it all worked out and if you guys
this is an option that you may wish to
consider especially if you go to
secondhand junk stores where parts are
really cheap so if you know especially
where the people at the store don't
really know much about computers which
is was which was the case where I went
to so yeah if you go to some junk stores
and check out pcs that don't work and
you inspect him and you know what you're
getting and you can potentially build
yourself a really cheap PC so that's
what's come out of this is it worth it
yes and no that's the answer and it
depends on your I guess your level of
experience and what you can do to make
things work though yeah
anyway if someone's in Japan and they
need a cheap PC man I can sell this
thing I can hook you up for like $50 so
if you're in Japan you need a cheap
computer send me a message and I'll hook
you up if you want this computer just
drop a better graphics card in there and
you have a really decent gaming PC
anyway that being said guys if you like
this video please give it a thumbs up if
you have any questions or comments about
the $40.00 rig that I've built
then please drop a call in the comment
section below and I will get back to you
as soon as possible and part three of
the set up the conclusion of this studio
will be coming I'm just going to do a
little few things with the cable
management around here and it will be
completed so expect that soon hey guys
I'll catch you with another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
