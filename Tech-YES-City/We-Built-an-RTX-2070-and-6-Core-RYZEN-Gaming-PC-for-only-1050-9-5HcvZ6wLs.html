come down to the point now
where they're just such
good value for money
here before Christmas in 2018.
And today here we have on
the desk, a PC for someone
that wants it all but
doesn't wanna spend it all.
It's gonna have a Ryzen 5 2600 6 core,
it's gonna have an RTX 2070,
decent power supply, hard drive, SSD,
and a case with some bling to match.
So let's take a look at all
these parts, and then of course
put this build together,
and see how it performs.
(upbeat music)
So going over the list of
components going in this build,
first up we have the Ryzen
5 2600 coming in at $169,
if you're in Australia, $212 on sale.
This is a 6 core, 12 thread
processor, the latest from AMD.
It's also overclockable, and comes
with an included CPU cooler
that runs really well.
Next up is DDR4 memory.
You can currently get this for
$109 for a 16 gigabyte kit.
If you're in Australia,
$164. Then we're going on
to the case. That's the
Deepcool Matrexx 55.
In the U.S. you can get it for
$38 but it doesn't have any
included RGB fans. So we're
adding an additional three RGB
fas to put at the front for $26.
In Australia this will cost you $69 AUD.
And it comes with the three fans included.
Moving on to storage you can
currently get 120 gigabyte SSDs
for as little as $23 in
America and in Australia $28.
120 gigabytes will be plenty
enough for using this as a
boot drive and if we need
more storage then we have a
one terabyte hard drive going
for $45, in Australia $62.
And for a power supply, now
we've got some different
choices here. I'm using a
550 Watt in my build today,
but if you're in America
you can get a 600 watt
going for just over $50,
and in Australia 800 watt going
for $82 on sale currently.
Also for a motherboard
to couple with your CPU,
you may wish to consider a
B450 which can currently be had
for $75, and in Australia you
can get an X370 motherboard
which is Ryzen 2000 series ready, which is
what we're using in the build
today for $87 AUD shipped.
And now onto the last
ingredient and that is the most
important for a gaming PC,
and that is the graphics card.
Here we have the Auris RTX
2070, but if you're looking
to save some money you
can currently pick them up
for as little as $500 or in
Australia $748 AUD on sale.
And of course, couldn't
forget the white LED strip
for a dollar shipped to your door.
But what are we waiting
for? Let's build this beast.
(deep bass music)
So we're just finishing
off this build now,
and there's one thing that's
really a little bit weird
about the build and that is,
it's a budget case but they've
got three fan headers here,
and they're all four pin,
and so if you're most likely
buying a budget case you're probably gonna
couple with a budget motherboard which
doesn't have that many fan header outs,
so, you'd definitely wanna
get yourself one of these.
I would've liked to have
seen Deepcool maybe include
a three to one, 3, 4 pin
to one Molex connector,
just to save anyone hassle,
but definitely add this
to the build if you're gonna use this case
with a budget orientated motherboard.
(deep bass music)
So we've just finished
building in the Matrexx 55
and I will give it some
props to how easy it was
to build in this thing.
Very spacious at the back,
no sharp edges so you won't
risk cutting yourself,
and the airflow at the front isn't too bad
for three pre-included
fans. Keep in mind however,
I do think the airflow kinda
feels a little bit awkward,
it doesn't feel like it's
doing a proper push-pull
through the front, but
we'll talk a little bit more
about this case and the build itself
after we tune this CPU
and also the memory.
So if you're getting
something similar to this,
then you can get the best
performance for your dollar,
and then we'll also test some games.
(upbeat electronic music)
So now we've finished tuning everything
and benchmarking and the
results are so impressive.
Not only just for the budget itself,
but I think the aesthetics
of the build kinda look good,
keep in mind it's missing a
tempered glass side panel.
That's because it shattered in shipping,
but because its a review
sample I still wanted to take
a look at the case anyway,
which we'll talk about later.
But here we've got the Ryzen
5 2600. It's overclocked
to 4 gigahertz with the
Wraith Stealth cooler,
and its performing so well.
Also with the RTX 2070
we've overclocked that
and we just got really
good performance all round.
1440p ultra settings, is
absolutely no problems
for this combination.
If you wanna drop it down the
higher settings of course,
we'll get even more FPS, and
when it came to Battlefield 5,
we were playing some Team
Deathmatch I was getting
over 100 FPS at 1440p
with maxed out settings.
We didn't bother turning on RTX just yet
because the performance
here is just too much.
Maybe after some more
optimization it will run better.
But we move over to Call
of Duty Black Ops 4,
that was a phenomenal experience too,
multiplayer was absolutely no problems
for this rig yet again
at 1440p ultra settings.
And when we move over
to Monster Hunter World.
Again it's not really optimized for PC,
but it still ran really well,
it's a smooth experience.
So what you've got here
is something that not only
represents phenomenal value for money
in more of the high end gaming scene,
but also something that
looks pretty decent as well.
We've got three RGB fans at
the front, got an LED strip
in there as well as a
Wraith fan at the back.
Now, this build would have
looked better had I not received
the case minus the tempered
glass side panel, if you guys
didn't know what happened
I'll put the link up here.
Essentially before I even opened the case
it was just shattered, and
because it's a review sample
and was sent over from
Taiwan, it's just too much
of a time wasting and
money wasting exercise
for Deepcool to send us another one,
so I thought I'd do the
review even though the build
would've looked better with
that tampered glass panel,
of course, especially to disperse
that white LED strip just hanging there.
But in terms of the budget
memory too, we got that
up to 2800 megahertz in dual
channel on this motherboard.
It was seal 18 timings,
and that's not the best,
but its by far no the worst either,
so if you can get this memory on a budget,
you can get it to decent speeds of course.
If you want a bit more
performance you can go
for 3200 megahertz, seal
14 XMP timing memory,
but that will set you back
a little bit more money,
so that upgrade is up to you
if you wish to go with it,
depends on how long you
wanna keep this for.
If you wanna mix and match some parts,
I'd probably go with the
upgrade to the better memory
but if you're on a budget
and you wanna keep things
strictly budget, then the
budget memory if you've got
a bit of time to tune it,
it's definitely a decent option too.
But also if you're in the
market to build a new PC,
then I think now is a really good time,
DDR4 memories come down in price,
crypto boom is over so
graphics cards have come down
a lot in price and so
those combinations together
as well as the fact that SSDs are so cheap
and X370 motherboards or
B450 motherboards as well
as the Ryzen 52600s, they're all cheap.
It's just a great time to
be building a new PC again
as opposed to in the
past, especially in 2018,
I haven't built many new PCs at all,
because of that crypto boom,
graphics cards were overpriced,
so building a lot more used PCs.
Then we had the DDR4 memory price hikes
which really value builds so hard do.
But coming up now before Christmas,
it's just great value for
money, at just over $1000,
this build screams price performance.
And then also if you're in Australia,
the pricing really isn't that bad at all,
it's similar to US pricing
when we look at triple p terms,
so you're not gonna be getting ripped off,
and it's certainly nothing
to be mad about either.
But now it's time to talk
about the Deepcool Matrexx 55.
And after building in this
thing I can honestly say
I'm pretty impressed
with it for the money,
I mean there's a few
little quirks of course,
the shipping box that it comes in
definitely could use
an upgrade as mine was
shattered in shipping, and
the box didn't look like
it was banged up that bad either.
They were using pretty good tempered glass
from what I could tell,
but you get three RGB fans
at the front if you get the RGB version,
which in Australia it's $69 AUD,
is definitely good value for money.
It comes with pre-installed
standoffs as well, which
I do like because it saves
me time if I'm building PCs,
and also inside there was no sharp edges,
everything was quite roomy
to work with as well.
You had two drive bays, I
would say that I'd like to see
more drive bays but I
think the average person
is only gonna use two
drives on a budget case.
In terms of room for cable management,
there was plenty of that,
dust filters were good,
and the fans at the front they were okay,
I guess for the price range.
The RGB effects were very limited,
I'd like to see the choice
at least to change between
all the different static colors
build into the controller,
and I'd also critique the Deepcool to say
please include a Molex
to three fan splitter
because a lot of people buying this case
are probably buying a budget motherboard,
and not having something
like that there could be
very frustrating if you can't
get all your fans plugged up.
But with some of those negatives aside,
I can't help but like the
Matrexx 55 for the money,
I think this is definitely
gonna be for someone
who wants to get a good
value for money case,
or it's a special for
someone who wants to flip
medium to high end PCs
but still have something
that looks good, and of
course has a decent airflow.
Even though the fans
themselves weren't the best
and they're by far not
anywhere near the best,
they're much better than
some of those options
that just have three really
weak fans in the front.
So will do a decent job,
especially with a build like this,
that only puts out around 330 watts,
you're not gonna have a problem at all,
but keep in mind, I
couldn't test that properly
because we don't have a side
glass panel to put over it,
but when inside the games the CPU
and GPU temperatures are pretty good.
And also another thing to keep in mind is,
it's 28 degrees ambient
where I'm at, at the moment,
and also I did overclock the CPU
and the GPU quite aggressively,
and everything still held up
while we were playing games.
Anyway guys I hope you
enjoyed today's build.
If you did then be sure
to hit that like button
and let us know in the
comments section below
what you think of the value 1k build.
Love reading your thoughts
and opinions as always,
and of course, that Ryzen 5 2600,
I'm gonna be making a
separate video about it,
because Intel just really
don't have anything like
the i5 8400 for sale at the moment,
so that's pretty much
leaving free reign for Ryzen
in terms of new price performance builds,
with this Ryzen 5, 6 cores.
Absolutely phenomenal value for money,
I'm sort of waiting on Intel
to release the i5 9400,
but they're not doing that.
So in the meantime,
you've got no competition,
AMD has got free reign,
absolutely phenomenal value for money.
And I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon.
Peace out for now. Bye.
