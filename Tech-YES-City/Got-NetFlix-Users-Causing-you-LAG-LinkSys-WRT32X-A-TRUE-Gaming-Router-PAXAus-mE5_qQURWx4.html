Linksys booth and this is very
interesting because they're making a
gaming router and now before you think
Oh gaming it's coming in its you
overused term they're actually going to
Vince which is nice to meet you
he's gonna explain the science behind
this routers he's built it from the
ground up so this thing is geared
towards gamers and he's gonna explain a
bit of the science behind this rally
what we wanted to do is build a true
gaming router and that's what we've done
here with the double RT 32x and you know
what we found out when I started to do
the research when you build a product
that's the first thing you do there are
others were out there that they were
called so called gaming routers but when
you really look under the hood you found
out they were using the same networking
stack that they're using in the consumer
products and maybe they were just
putting some color antennas on it maybe
with some RGB LEDs and then shipping out
and saying here's your gaming router
Linksys is being a technology driven
company we really couldn't do that we
we're gonna build a gaming router we're
gonna really build a gaming router that
really solves those problems with the
online gaming community so now with this
I basically built up with having the
killer software implemented into the
router itself in the firmware right so
with that you're basically eliminating a
lag especially lag that comes from a
congested network right so if someone's
at home and they want to play games with
other people in the home are using the
network this thing will help give a
better experience with online gaming
right absolutely
and can what we're doing is working with
the guys over at killer networking that
are doing the amazing things in a number
of the gaming pcs from Alienware razer
gigabyte and and lenovo and msi and
they're doing amazing things inside
those boxes but what was happening in
the past is that once it came out and
there's others on the network that would
impact that gameplay and you know the
number one thing we did and found out on
a research is that when they're ready to
go do their online game play and then
others jumped on the network - pink
times within go crazy and that and then
you'd have to run through the house and
say everybody get off the network and so
that was like the biggest issue we found
it so that was what the main mission was
and building this thing is building a
router that can maintain low ping times
and still no matter what it's happening
on that network so other you know
girlfriend boyfriend roommate family
jumps on the networks and starts doing
their media streaming it will not impact
your online gameplay and so you're not
know you know creating issues with other
guys in your squad no matter where
they're playing in the rest of the world
so again even in using that the killer
prioritization engine that we developed
with the killer of networking guys we've
built a custom firmware stack that basic
was the vessel for this killer partition
engine to be able to manage the
bandwidth contention in the home awesome
so basically I've tested this in the
past as well the killer network is legit
it does work especially with congested
networks now also that's not the only
good thing about this router right it's
got the signal strength you're telling
me that it's really good with the five
gigahertz signal and the two point four
now what speeds what's the max speeds on
the five gigahertz line this router
actually has the fastest five gigahertz
band in the market we're using a
enterprise-grade Marvell chipsets in
here and they're the only ones that are
actually doing a three stream radios
that are running in a 160 megahertz so
we're able to pump 2.6 gigabits per
second out of that five gigahertz on so
again amazing Wi-Fi and in why that's
important for for gamers is that we're
seeing you know console is predominantly
hooked up through Wi-Fi but where we're
really seeing a lot of the online gaming
growth is in mobile and that's where it
really is important for a really good
Wi-Fi signal and now you're also seeing
now mobile becoming in the competitive
sense so there's this competitive mobile
gaming so that's even more importantly
but also again wired is also handled
because it doesn't matter Wi-Fi or wired
that killer partition engine works on
both sides so you don't have to say oh
you have to plug the gaming PC in this
particular port it happens no matter how
you need to hit that hit that router
with it and switch chipset in here again
is a discrete switch chipset that is a
piece of got our higher end enterprise
grade switch line so that just so
happens our enterprise grade switches
are powering packs is open to play and
BYOC area downstairs right now and in
Seattle's packs event our enterprise
rates which line
driving of 450 endpoints in the open to
play area and another 350 over on the
BYOC area so Linksys is one of the few
companies that actually can scale from
full-blown tournament and uber land
party situations all the way down to
taking a piece of that enterprise great
technology home for use to make sure
that your home networking is great when
you're doing your online gameplay well
there you heard of guys so this thing is
not just built up with gaming uses a
term it's actually got really good hard
way to match instead of dropping RGB
lights on this thing and putting fancy
colors they're going with the hardware
and that's what a lot of you guys out
there want when it comes to actually
buying a product that's suited is
especially in this case towards gaming
so now also some other features with
this router is that it's got a very long
signal length to you were telling me
before in your house one router in a
three story home in the middle your
house signals five bars to all devices
in your house again I'm getting that
pole home a coverage with this guy in
here a beacon because we're using a
three by three setup but we're using
four radios so we're able to do a
diversity and their be able to have that
beamforming really kicking and making
sure that signal is getting everywhere
you need it awesome so now also on this
router there's USB three as well
connectivity as well so if you need to
use that for transferring you can use
that and there's also a solder as well
so great connectivity on this router and
how much are we looking at price-wise in
Australia terms and also USD terms as
well in the US its sewing for 299 and in
Australia we're selling for I think 449
Australian so there these guys the WR to
32x gaming router this is the launch
event here at PAX you can pick it up on
the shelves if you're at the PAX event
of course it'll be in stores as well
from your local retailer and you're just
looking forward to getting one of these
things in my own home and testing it out
and seeing just how good it is because I
definitely will need a wireless router
in my home because I've recently got
these tp-link things but you guys were
telling me that the whole bad yeah the
reaction was bad so I look forward to
also seeing you guys in another tech
video very soon as well if you have any
comments about the wrt 32x then be sure
to drop a comment in the comment section
below and I am Not sure Vince will be
reading the comment session as well
be sure to answer your comments as soon
as we can anyway thanks for coming up
Vince today and then talking into us
about this great new router and I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
