to test the GTX 970 versus the online
390 and today I'm going to be putting
these two bad boys head-to-head and
we're gonna see who comes out on top so
for a while I've been asked what is the
best graphics card for around $300 and
today I'm going to be testing the GTX
970 g1 from gigabyte and I'll be putting
that head-on with the msi r9 390 on the
AMD side so without further ado let's
get on with the benchmarks I'm just
playing with you let's get something a
little heavier going
you
you
you
you
so now we're done and dusted with the
benchmarks it's time to talk about a
recommendation and which one you should
buy in which situation because I both
believe they're very valid purchases
especially if you bought one don't be
disappointed that you didn't buy the
other I would say that both these cards
are phenomenal for $300 they're actually
the real sweets byte card at the moment
and also we'll add on that that if you
are a pure gamer and all you're doing is
nothing but gaming and powers pretty
cheap where you live I would give the
slight edge to the r9 390 especially
with that 8 gigabytes of gddr5 on board
and especially with the rumors that
going around that dx12 titles are going
to be more favored towards AMD's
architecture so now on to the nvidia
side and where this card has its
advantages and that is that it uses less
power than the AMD card now depending on
where you live that may be a factor for
you I'd say if you have cheap power it
should be a non-factor but if you're in
a country like me where you're paying 35
cents a kilowatt-hour it could be a
factor that adds up over time however
keep in mind there are other benefits to
using the Nvidia card like shadow play
and CUDA cause two things that I
personally as a YouTube content creator
couldn't live without so in conclusion I
will reiterate though both these cards
are phenomenal for the money and I
couldn't see how you would be
disappointed if you bought one over the
other however I will say in closing that
the temperatures on both these solutions
that I have here today were phenomenal
both these cards hit around 63 degrees
62 degrees and they were pretty quiet
whilst doing so in a 20 degree ambient
condition controlled environment and
also one final note I will add about the
AMD card was when I was testing it in
America the overclocks were not stable
and then one person mentioned in the
comments that this is most likely
because of a power supply and I'll
surprised because I was using a 1000
watt NZXT power supply but sure enough
when I came home back to my studio here
and I tested it with the 630 what Animax
revolution xt which is a lot lower than
a 1000 volt power supply it ran really
stable really smooth so I was really
impressed but one thing to come out of
that is mate
be careful with what how supply you get
anyway guys that's it for me if you like
this video then please hit the thumbs up
button and if you haven't ready
subscribe to tech yes City and I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
