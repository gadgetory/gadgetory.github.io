underperforming pcs one man is here the
fragrance this is PC house car welcome
back to episode two of PC house call now
last time I did this with James we went
over we tuned his PC overclocked his
6700 K he was over the moon absolutely
loving the performance gains now this
time around I'm joined by my good friend
Luke and we're gonna do the exact same
thing and I've known him for 18 years do
you want to tell him the story of how we
first met
so yeah me and Brian met when we were
young kids going through primary school
and high school we used to meet up
play a bit of broodwar together and you
know it was fun times there's good times
yeah so we used to go out on the weekend
party and do all those things that
teenagers did and then on the Sunday
when we're hungover we played brood war
epic game yeah brood war sesh and
essentially today what I'm doing with a
Luke's PC is the same shindig that we've
always done and we always will be doing
is we're gonna clean this dust filled
underperforming PC we're gonna put a gtx
1080 in it as well and also luke has
swapped me two pcs for a gtx 1080 now of
course i'm getting a really good deal
out of this but Luke also picked these
pcs up for a two hundred Australian
dollars each year yeah they say there's
two computers both of them have an i7 in
them they've both got 16 gig of ram
they've got two Radeon graphics cards I
believe and there's two by two points or
yeah 24 inch monitors as well to go with
them so so now behind me I'm gonna start
doing my magic we're gonna check out all
the current specs of Luke's PC we're
gonna test the performance as it stands
and then of course we're gonna do a
complete overhaul of this machine or at
least in terms of overclocking and also
putting in that new graphics card and
see what I can do yeah and see what it
does before and then of course after so
let's get on with it
so the games that Luke currently likes
to play as overwatch at 1080p at high
settings and also World of Warcraft on a
simulated 4k setting with high graphics
settings now for what of Warcraft he
likes playing at the 4k settings simply
because his user interface buttons are
then smaller he can see everything
that's going on in arena and he wants to
get the best experience in these two
games so currently with overwatch he's
getting around 120 FPS average at these
settings and then with what of Warcraft
he's currently getting around 50 FPS
though of course he does have to lower
the settings in water Warcraft to get
higher frame rates though the GTX 1080
should solve this problem however for
tuning the PC I like to use four
different programs Cinebench ida 64 msi
afterburner and also UniGene heaven and
upon stress testing the cpu there was a
big problem and we found this out with
ida 64 stress test the cpu was going
near a hundred degrees celsius and also
thermal throttling this is a big problem
and i do have a solution for this
problem with a reven akeno's so now
luke's pc consists of an i7 4770k on a
z87 xtreme three motherboard also has 16
gigabytes of ddr3 memory and dual
channel configuration so this board will
be good for a decent overclock however
he does have a GTX 970 and he does
complain about having graphics settings
not being able to max out on ultra with
really good frame rates in some of these
games of course the GTX 1080 will fix
this problem and we're pairing this off
the C Sonic 650 watt gold rated power
supply so we can reuse this bass player
it is really good and it will do an
absolutely fine job not just
overclocking and give it a stable
overclocks but also pairing that gtx 980
and overclocking that as well now one
thing you may also notice is that is
using a thermal take case that's
completely open-air this is okay if you
want to keep temperatures cool
especially in summer however it does
attract a lot of dust so we're gonna
give this a full cleanse I'm going to do
some more cable management because he
currently has a jungle sandwich in here
and then we're gonna see what this case
looks like after
so I'm just overclocking now and the
temperatures are a lot better I've
overclocked the CPU to four point three
gigahertz and I'm under the pump here
I've got absolutely no time they've got
to do some stuff I'm under the pump I've
got this to four point three gigahertz
I'm gonna run some quick benchmarks make
sure that this thing is stable but it's
also looking really good and it's clean
and then Luke will be one happy customer
so starting off with the benchmarks
running through Cinebench we saw a boost
at over 800 CB which was great before we
had the throttling CPU going anywhere
from 650 to 700 but when we looked at
the next benchmark the heav'n benchmark
that got a really big increase as well
and then of course moving on into the
games over watch over double the FPS I
was really blown away by this figure it
was really smooth over 240 FPS a lot of
the times sometimes maxing out at 300
FPS great for Luke who has a high
refresh rate monitor - and then moving
on into World of Warcraft in that main
city again we went from 40 to 50 FPS all
the way up to 90 to 100 FPS so
practically a double in frame rates on
this PC so I think Luke is gonna be
happy with this but let's hear it from
himself so here we are now with Luke's
PC behind me it is finished finito
and I've also overclocked it so we got
the CPU to 4.3 gigahertz which I would
like to get a bit higher I'd like to
ultimately deal it it possibly give it a
maybe an extra 50 to 100 millivolts see
if I can get to 4.5 4.6 gigahertz memory
was interesting but we still got out to
1600 megahertz and the graphics card of
course the GTX 1080 an absolute beast
got that - 2.0 5 gigahertz and it was
running absolutely amazing your games
are now over double what they were
before with that 970 and dirty dust
filled PC and it was not even
overclocked it was throttling a hundred
degrees now you've got 70 degrees how do
you feel about this I am so happy with
this job that you've done for me it is
amazing I can't wait to game on this
it's been it's been amazing you've
pretty much doubled my FPS so really
looking forward to gaming with this
piece
you know that's what I want to hear you
so we have guys there's not a whole lot
more to this PC I'd like to spend a bit
more time with it as I said before but
ultimately Luke's a happy camper over
double the area happy and we're just
gonna eat some dinner and I'm gonna head
on home because I am over an hour away
from Lukey has moved away from the Gold
Coast now unfortunately but if you guys
have any questions about PC house call
I'll put the link to the previous
episode episode one where I tuned up
James PC I'll put the link in the
description below for that and if you
have any questions for Luke or I in the
description or in the comment section
below
then drop a comment and we'll catch you
guys in another tech video very soon
yourself for now you get the mic right
I'll see ya
peace out for now
so sure power supplies yep terrible
power supplies yeah so from the start
been met Brian when it's what's better
than one gold Mike two gold mice and
we're pairing this often and we're
pairing this off a see sonic 650 watt
doll rated power and they're gonna see
what this case can look after and you go
talk closer you talk about you talk like
this with the mic you talk that way and
you have it just under your lip so
you're not going like this if you go
this you know it's gonna pop yeah all
right yeah that's good and remember the
Mike's gotta move with you to it's like
this yeah so yeah you hold the bar hide
the bicep and it moves one in tandem
with you like this see ya welcome Lee
Lewis welcome back to tech yes it is
Brian coming to you guys today
