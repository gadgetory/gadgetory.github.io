their r-tx Super Series line of cards
and these were a direct response to the
upcoming launch of AMD's Navi graphics
cards that is the 50 750 700 XT however
the Super Series in its naming scheme is
a little bit different to what you might
expect for instance on the desk here
we've got the RT X 2060 Super which
comes in with 2176 scooter cause over
that of the 1920 of the 2060 and it
comes in at $50 us more however one
interesting thing about this car is it's
actually based off the RT X 2070 more so
than the 2060 in that it has the same
memory bus at 256 bit and it also has 8
gigabytes of vram giving it an extra 2
gigabytes of vram over that of the 2060
it also has high rate racing performance
coming in with 6 Giga rays versus 5g you
raised on the 2060 though today we're
gonna focus on this $400 GPU compare it
against the RT X 2060 RT X 2070 and also
the 5,700 now I actually don't have the
5700 XT on hand which actually comes in
at the exact same price as this card and
that's in the mail so I will be doing a
review on that separately soon here on
the channel though that aside let's get
into some of these gaming benchmarks and
talk about who this card is for and why
so going through some of the numbers
here at 1080p in both 1440p we can see
here with shadows of the Tomb Raider at
1080p it competes with the 5700 and
pulls well ahead of that of the 2060 the
2070 still pulls ahead by just a little
bit but that's because it's got 5
percent more CUDA cores on board moving
over to the 1440p numbers it does start
to pull ahead of both the 2060 and the
AMD's 5,700 a little bit more in
comparison to the 1080p numbers move
over to strange Brigade we can see a
similar trend here with a 2060 super
does perform quite well both at 1080p
and 1440p they're moving over now to
Apex legends this is a game where AMD
have optimized their graphics cards for
this particular title and it does show
on the numbers where the 5,700 is coming
out well ahead but the 2060 super does
still beat that up the 2060 comes very
close to the 2070 and maybe over Tom
Clancy's the division 2 at 1080p it does
quite well but then it does pull ahead a
little bit more 1440p and they're moving
into dirt rally - both at 1080p and
1440p I noticed something a little bit
different about this title and one thing
I did in particular with the settings
was put the anti-aliasing up pretty high
and in this particular title the 2060
super does perform quite well against
the r-tx 2070 RTX 2060 and the 5700 so I
did a few more tests here at the studio
and this is when I decided to test
shadows of the Tomb Raider this time at
1080p with SMA at 4 times and this puts
a lot of strain on the memory interface
and here we can see the 2060 at 1080p
actually comes close to that of the 5700
and then the 2070 super does pull
comfortably ahead of both these other
cards and then when we overclocked we
did get some significant gains on the
2060 super that scaled better for the
super card than the non super 2060 and
then the 5,700 didn't do so well in this
particular title when it was overclocked
and then the last title we got up here
is far cry new dawn 1440p with SMA a
turned on ultra settings you see here
that the super does come ahead of the
2016 but not by a whole lot and the 5700
actually pulls ahead by a little bit in
this particular title looking at the
power consumption figures we can see
that we've got 302 watts roughly on the
2060 in shadows of the Tomb Raider
overclocked it did a little bit more on
the wattage and then
twenty sixty super does juice a little
bit more wattage a321 watts then
overclock 345 the 5700 was the most
efficient out of the box though
overclocking this did see the wattage
raise slightly above that of the 2060 so
the gaming benchmarks out of the way we
can see that the our TX 2060 super
actually comes pretty close to that of
the twenty seventy more so than the
twenty sixty and a $50 us more I would
easily buy this over the original twenty
sixty if you wanted to go with the
Nvidia or option course a fifty seven
hundred fifty seven hundred XT are
options from AMD but if you are wanting
to extract some of those features that
Nvidia offers for instance the game
filter and also DL SS and ray-tracing
and the last thing I'm gonna mention as
well is the envy encoder where that's
actually very good in their latest
iteration of cheering GPUs besides the
1650 which actually uses the old envy
encoder but the newest one on the RT X
2060 super just like the RT X 2060 will
perform phenomenally well if you want to
stream and not bog down your whole
system especially if you don't have a
lot of cores and threads this will do an
excellent job and I'm gonna pull up a
pass as foxes test results here where he
showed that this is actually giving out
better quality than that of h.264 CPU
encoding at medium settings which is
quite strenuous on your cpu for
streaming but now focusing on this
founder's card in particular at the back
you've got a DVI dual link out you've
got USB type-c
to display outs and a hdmi 2.0 the
weight of this card comes in roughly at
975 grams includes a backplate as well
as having two additional 90 mil fans
which do a very solid job of cooling
from the results i've tested here in
UniGene heaven when the card was
overclocked we see it a hundred percent
we're getting sixty-two degrees Celsius
max temperatures this is in a twenty
five degree ambient environment and that
had 59 decibels of noise stepping it
down to 80 percent we saw a maximum of
67 degrees fifty-three decibels and then
what I feel is the sweet spot is 60% fan
speeds 72 degrees Celsius and a 47
decibel max noise reading and then on to
the auto fan speeds they waxed out a 52%
45 decibels and seventy-six degrees
Celsius so the cooler implemented on the
founders Edition I do like this solution
it is doing a good job at cooling and
keeping noises down
if you wanted to make a custom fan
profile and afterburner for example you
can maybe set 20% idle speeds and then
ramp that up to maximum of 60% and you'd
have low noise and good temperatures so
now in closing this review off for you
guys the 2060 super a 400 USD is not the
best value for money in 2019 but it is a
better solution than both the 2060 and
the 2070 in that value orientated
segment of the mid-range and the
features it does offer are pretty strong
and I do like the cooling solution but
here's where things start to get a
little bit weird because in the u.s. you
can get this for around the retail price
of 400 USD and the r-tx 2060 is
currently going for around 340 us then
when I check the Australian prices you
can currently get that for 474 ozzie and
then this is coming in at over 689
Aussie dollars making the r-tx
2060 in Australia a much better buy if
you're looking for value for money and
you want to get a brand new card anyway
guys if you enjoyed today's review then
be sure to hit that like button for us
also let us know in the comments section
below
what you think of the RTS 2060 super
I've also reviewed the 5700 if you want
to check that out I'll put the link up
here for you guys
the 5700 XT and also the 2017 super and
2080 super reviews will be coming on
later this month if you want to see
those the moment they dropped sub button
ring the bell it's down there and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
