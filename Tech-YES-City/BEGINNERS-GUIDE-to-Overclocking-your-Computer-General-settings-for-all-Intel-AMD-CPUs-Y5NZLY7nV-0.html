coming back today with a tutorial today
on how to overclock your cpu in general
so my last tutorial was Ivy Bridge today
I'm going to explain in general so in
other words if I picked up an AMD
motherboard and processor or if I picked
up another or a Sandy Bridge and a
motherboard and I picked up a q9 550 and
a motherboard what would I do initially
to find those good clock settings that I
want to use for stable overclocks
so let's get into it guys first you need
three programs you're going to need core
temp CPU Z and prime95 there's the three
that I use there are others that you can
use but you it's up to you guys you know
and another thing I want you guys to do
is after you've installed your OS I want
you to sorry in my computer right-click
properties go to Hardware right click on
where your OS is installed click
properties change settings policies and
make sure enable rikishi on the device
is turned off ok so your system crashes
and their files with them and they
become crop so let's do that
ok just stress testing so I'm running an
Ivy Bridge here at 4.2 gig and I'm
running it at 1.10 volts so that's at
the moment this is my daily overclock
and it's really stable and I like the
temps that I'm getting so that's really
nice overclock ok so there's three
programs core temp will give you the
temps of your CPU CPU Z will give you
the information about your CPU the volts
it's running out and the speed it's
running at and prime95 obviously will
just stress test the CPU so obviously
you want to stress test for a couple
hours after if you know to make sure you
got a pretty stable clock so anyway
let's restart the
let's restart and go into box so now
basically when we get into BIOS we are
going to get I'm going to go back to
your default settings and I straight
back there and I am going to basically
go back to default settings and show you
what I would do so let's go back loaded
ufi defaults so now everything is back
to default settings okay so now every
motherboard is going to be different
okay
Zeus asrock gigabyte they're all going
to have different like layouts for their
boss but there's going to be a section
where it's CPU configuration or
somewhere along that lines I had little
bit man
so my baby's just crying he's getting
excited you did he wants a clock as well
when he grows old um hey guys and since
my last tutorial on a Star Wars Lego
watch gives me powers unknown powers
that not even God Himself can fathom
these powers that this lego star was
watch gives me is you don't believe
anyway but set stock settings this is
the stock settings as I'm showing you
here turbo this goes up to 3800 not to
worry okay so let's go to auto we're
going to leave that on auto at the
moment we're back everything's back to
default settings and what we are going
to do is this time we are going to find
out on Auto how much voltage we are
getting okay so let's say that an exit
we're going to find out first off
everything on auto what voltage are we
getting in cpu-z
what temperatures are we getting and
obviously what speeds are we getting so
let's find that out now okay so let's
start it up
okay
everything's back on default very easy
we're going to load up call Tim and yes
SSDs are awesome the varying runs a lot
faster Ivy Bridge is really fast too
it's really responsive CPU okay so let's
get that running now okay so we are
basically on 1.10 volts at 3.6 gigahertz
so basically this is my stock voltage
okay this is what the manufacturers said
look one by one volts on stock volt
stock settings one point one volt is
what your we're going to make your CPU
overclock to now obviously as you saw
before mine was 4200 at the same voltage
so I'm getting six hundred megahertz for
free that's because you know that's what
I program that's what I've fiddled
around with that's the settings that
I've ended up coming at so one more one
volt
so what we're going to say is okay let's
restart this computer now and try and
get the lowest voltage at this stock
setting okay so that would give us
firstly that would give us an idea of
how good our CPUs if we've got a good
one or a poor one or an average one
it'll give us an idea of what overclocks
we can expect at what volts as well so
first off leave that on although CPU
ratio stays on order and let's try now
CPU voltage fixed mode okay so offset
mode is for when you've got your
settings you know what voltages you want
um you know what voltages you want and
that's you know offset modes for like
after you've got sort of your settings
figured out but if you want you can
straight away you can ignore fixed mode
if you want because you know it's a 1.1
volt okay so that's what the stock
setting is right so we know that we know
level 5 is the auto setting for load
line calibration on this motherboard so
if you know what your settings are load
line calibration like it basically when
you load up a program it will get
we'll have more volts and then as the
program is being used and as the calls
are being stressed it'll lower the
voltage so I use level 5 as well so we
want to use level 5 LLC I'm going to use
fixed mode at this time see one point
one volt
that's what it's going to tell you okay
it's going to tell you in bars it's
going to tell you Windows that this is
your stock fixed setting at order now
why don't we try I'm feeling pretty
lucky so why don't we go low why don't
we go ridiculously low point nine this
is frigging low so we're going to try it
stock settings point nine volts
basically fixed voltage so what fixed
voltage does is opposed to offset fixed
voltage will keep it at that voltage at
all times if you change the offset
voltage then you will enable your
motherboard to use speedstep technology
so that doesn't even work okay that's
not even booting okay that's pretty
pretty dangerous because if you go too
low and you can't even boot your
motherboard you're gonna have to clear
the CMOS okay so that's a little bit
annoying but let's we can get into BIOS
so that's kind of cool
let's try nine five now so like I said
in my other tutorial if you are not even
getting into Windows I recommend going
either 0.03 or 0.05 huh I'm going to go
0.05 because that was just fast crash
that didn't even go anywhere so let's
try point nine five this time see how we
go now yeah so basically what you're
doing is you're finding how you know
fixed voltage and of course Simon is
normally since we took those hard drive
options off before we're not going to
corrupt any files I window as a starting
ormally it should be no problems yes
sorry back to where I was before on the
overclocking okay we're we're just
finding down orientation we're finding
these settings ok so if loader wearing
Windows now ok point nine five volts
everything's on stock we're going to
load up this and it's giving us C 3.6
again
let's get some maximum meat going and
now if this runs for about ten minutes I
mean it if it runs for about ten minutes
even even a couple of minutes you know
it kind of means that you are a little
bit stable you're getting close to that
voltage so this is fixed voltage this is
going to stay since we've got load like
I said before since we've got the load
line calibration on level five it will
drop the voltage as the pores are being
stressed so now in CB Gesu were reading
point nine volt as opposed to our fixed
voltage which said point nine five so
this is a good thing a load like
calibration is a good thing
it's actually I never saw it on my old
motherboard which was a LGA 775 I never
saw this feature so I'm glad it's I
actually might assume I'm did V drop
something that yeah I'm actually I'm
getting bit I like this setting it's
good so there we go guys fixed voltage
it seems to be pretty good temperatures
are really low I'm my temperatures
before like 67 something so I've gone
down at 11 degrees but obviously was 600
meters it's slower now that's pretty
good that seems to be pretty good okay
so what's this saying what's it saying
to us is this look you'll point two
volts under what the manufacturer was
giving you okay so in other words this
CPU can run almost point two volts lower
at the same speeds as opposed to what
the motherboard manufacturer or Intel
was saying it could do now that for me
is a big difference so that's going to
be more power usage
hey that yeah that's going to be more
power uses it's going to juice the life
of your CPU more so the higher your
voltage goes the less life your city is
going to have so yeah if you guys are
you know economy you know budget minded
and you want to save power but you don't
really need the speeds of going to four
point two gigs then you can keep your
settings at here it's pretty good you
know that's going to save power okay now
what I'm going to say is we'll look the
point nine ball point nine five fixed
voltage LLC five we've got we got this
three point six
obtained so now let's try going higher
so we'll try 4 gigahertz this time okay
let's try that so I'm going to restart
the computer now these three programs
guys I've given the links in my
description below so you can get them if
you want to they're pretty easy to get
that's actually a pretty good overclock
guys I might even use that sometimes you
know when I'm that's actually I found a
good article for myself there I will not
not a good Oh quite a good under clock
sort of that's what they call it so
there we go so louver point 95 and we're
a fixed mode okay so what we want to do
now is we want to find say for instance
now let's try for Gigot because I've
never done 40 Hertz before okay
at least all coral I call called better
because if you look at per quarter we
had you know for call ratio limit it was
three point six and that's what my
computer was running at when I needed
the power so I like all core better
because it's just easier to tune okay so
let's try four four gigahertz this time
so all course if you ratio and if you
haven't if you have a different
motherboard it may be called something
else and may be called core activity I
don't know because I've only used as
rocks and a Zeus's interface for this
azusa's was kind of like an aeroplane
cockpit it was a little bit weird it's
kind of like what the hell's going on
when I first saw it so I love as rocks
BIOS interface very easy to use guys so
let's keep looking now we're going to go
let's try four gigahertz let's just go
straight up a little bit of power let's
make a go okay so we're going you know
we're going another four hundred Meg's
over what we had before let's try and do
1.0 one that's what I'm going to roughly
say is okay 1.01 volts at four gigahertz
now I'm pretty sure this will crash as
it's pretty low if it doesn't crash
great
I still don't probably I don't
understand ivory bridge a hundred
percent still probably understand about
eighty-five percent so very you know
it's a very interesting process or in
that as again
well as the CPU speeds go up and the
voltage goes up it really gets the
diminishing returns really sets in let's
try that again so that just didn't end
but so again so saying about that thing
of 0.3 higher I'm going to go four point
oh five it's simple easy done Brian easy
that's one of those bronies I do things
pretty easy let's start that up so we're
just going to beat this time that 4
gigahertz and we were slow there's
normally there should be a problem and
let's keep going with this
so I have tweaked my windows if you guys
want to tweak your windows I have a
whole guide there to tweak your windows
and make it faster make it more
responsive so you see my menus are
really fast you know everything's really
responsive and it feels more responsive
so thanks you know everything's really
good now let's slide up cool temp we are
in Windows now we are starting fine ok
maximum heat that's what we want guys
that's frozen there we go so we got to
go higher we just put it up I will go to
1.08 this time ok so you find your
overboard okay so you're in fixed
voltage we're four gigahertz now we are
going to go up - it did start that time
so I'm going to try 1.07 see how that
goes and basically you're just going to
keep trying settings until you get what
works and you're going to find out what
voltage your CPU likes so remember we
know that our stock setting is 1 point 1
volt ok so when we use offset mode it's
going to be 1 point 1 volt that's what
it's going to use so now we are going to
find out
if this overclock is stable now at one
point nine seven volts just getting 400
mega the thing about are your bread you
get 400 megahertz you're just getting
400 megahertz more that's taking so much
more time so ok CPU had a little bit of
a bit of the wind
let's try stressing this ok ok we right
we're in now guys and obviously as you
can see we're at 1 volt at 4 gigahertz
that's after the load line calibration
set in ok now that's a pretty good
overclock I like that as well that's
pretty damn stable I mean it's pretty
damn solid what I'm trying to say is ok
so I'm going to rush things here because
it is a video and you know I'm going to
try and rush things a little bit but
yeah okay we're at 1.07 fixed voltage we
seem to be relatively stable not I mean
we're not stable goes out and tested it
for hours but we are getting
temperatures about 60 degrees which is
pretty cool I liked actually I'm liking
these temps I'm liking this overclock as
well sounds pretty nice foggy Hertz 1
volt pretty low pretty cool things
pretty cool Star Wars Lego watch yeah so
let's go so that's done guys that's we
found our fixed voltage theoretically I
mean I still if I was doing this like
really thoroughly I would test it for a
couple hours but you know I'm just doing
this really quickly so ok one bolt it's
working pretty good
temperatures are fine it's a good
overclock for gigahertz ok so if you go
different CPU it's going to be different
obviously so now we're going to go back
in okay so we know it's
we know our fixed voltage is one point
one and our fixed goal to do one point
one so we are - 3 / offset okay so
offset mode will leave the motherboard
now we're going to change the offset
mode and that will leave the motherboard
settings right this what fix about what
offset mode will do is it will run off
the automatic motherboard voltage so the
fixed voltage you will run at a fixed
voltage all time the offset mode is
going to say look it's one point one
volt
normally now it can be we can go since
we found it at one point one seven we're
going to get minus zero point three so
that's what we're telling our mother
would be go run under run point zero
three volts under what I fix what our
default settings for the motherboard
boss now we're going to leave our load
line calibration level five that hasn't
changed
for gigahertz overclock that hasn't
changed either okay now we've found our
fixed voltage sweet spot so we're going
to say offset mode okay is 3 volts under
the automatic setting of one point one
now we're going to see that okay I'm
going to save that and when I exit okay
now but this is normally okay so I'm
showing you guys what will normally
happen on any motherboard and CPU what I
found on this extreme for motherboard it
might need a BIOS update but it's a
little bit different it actually puts
the fixed voltage at 1.15
so the I mean sorry the motherboard says
the auto setting is 1.15 which is a
little bit weird I you know I don't know
why it says it's one point one in boss
but in Windows it's saying it's one
point one five that's just a you know
that's just the programming one they
programmed the boss that's all I did
that they sort of messed up a little bit
but anyway so basically not to worry
because we know since we know that yeah
it's one point one five or the automatic
voltage for it is
1.13 okay so since we know this is now
it were minus point zero three right
this is because my boss is a little bit
weird I will I will quickly show you
anyway how I figure out you know
overcoming my bias
you know weirdness that asrock sort of
thinned it's not a problem because you
know you just going to do a little bit
maths you say well go Cowboys II row
three right I had it I had it at one
point one I know so I had at one point I
was seven before and now it's okay so
it's basically 0.13 volts above what my
overclock was before okay so it's
basically one point one see if we saw
before we had here we had one point one
volts now it's one point one three so
it's basically point one three over what
we had before okay so that's easy to
figure out now because we can just
restart the computer and take it down
0.1 three volts which is a lot it's a
lot near that's actually a lot anyway
okay so we're going into overclocked
weaker and we're going to say okay well
let's try what down to 1.16 since you're
a funny another board okay we'll try
maybe one point one five five because
it's being a little bit weird now that's
and hopefully it should boot I mean it
might crash it might need more that the
semantics is the motherboard the biasing
the motherboards being a little bit
weird so yeah if you do your math you
can figure it out yourself you see it's
not much of a problem
so that's booting it seems to be okay so
far probably might have to give it
because offset mode will see fixed fixed
mode is more stable than offset mode
guys so offset mode may need another
point zero one volt
compared to fixed mode because of the
fact that it's under clocking and
overclocking back you know back and
forth with speedstep technology so
you're going to remember that let's load
this up processes okay and that that
pretty much concludes this tutorial guys
I'm showing you how I found this
overclock and as we see there we're
getting what we had before 1.1 by doing
a little bit of math we've found you
know it's pretty much where it was
before in fixed mode and we're in offset
mode now okay so that's it that's the
guy that's how you find step-by-step
that's how you find your overclock on
any motherboard any CPU okay by those
steps that I just taught you here now if
you like this video guys please thumbs
up if you've got any questions please
leave them in the comment section below
and of course please subscribe to keep
Brian as you go on as you know as your
subscriptions really helped me so I like
to help you guys and I like to do
tutorials and help people whenever I can
so I hope this helped you today and if
you you know please leave any comments
and section below and I'll get back to
you soon as I can okay alright guys
