easy coming back to you guys today with
stereo vs. cmss 3d of 5.1 our next
comparison now for this comparison I
want you guys to turn your headphones or
speakers to just standard 20.1 or just
standard headphone stereo out as if you
have a 5.1 unmix you're essentially
going to be up mixing a five-point
already up mixed 5.1 sound so now let's
move on now the first demo will be
Skyrim after that I've got some Call of
Duty ghosts and also after that I've got
some battlefield 4 and I'll put the time
links in the description below see if
you want to see a particular game and
how it plays you can check that out
anyway let's watch the footage and then
I'll come back to you guys with the
conclusion
Ulfric Stormcloak some here in helghan
call you a hero but a hero doesn't use a
power like the voice to murder his king
and usurp his throne you started this
war won Skyrim into chaos
and now the Empire is going to port you
down and restore the peace
it's nothing carry on
yes general Tullius give them their last
rites as we commend your souls to a
serious blessings of the eight Divine's
for the love of Talos shut up and let's
get this over as you wish
come on I haven't got all morning
my ancestors are smiling at me Imperials
can you say the same
to the stoic close as fearlessly death
as he was in life careless again did you
hear that I said next prisoner to the
block prisoner nice and easy
century what do you see
alleged to be true legends like
all Forex Stormcloak some here in
helghan call you a hero but a hero
doesn't use a power like the voice to
murder his king and usurp his throne you
started this war once Skyrim into chaos
and now the Empire is going to put you
down and restore the peace what's that
it's nothing
carry on yes general Tullius give them
their last rites
as we commend your souls to a serious
blessings of the eight Divine's before
the love of Talos shut up and let's get
miso Killearn as you wish
come on I haven't got all morning
my ancestors are smiling at me Imperials
and you say the same
justice
to the Stormcloaks as fearless and death
as he was in life
here it is again did you hear that I
said next prisoner to the block prisoner
nice and easy
century what do you see
we lost the weight
deathmatch type of work ghost squad
but yeah
so in conclusion I thought the titanium
HDS up next to 5.11 with cmss 3d sounded
phenomenal in Skyrim and ghosts
battlefield 4 I mean I thought the the
game already did a pretty decent job in
headphone mode I thought it enhanced it
a little bit but otherwise I thought you
know this sound card the 5.1 op mix in
the same SS 3d really does make a
difference for games I mean Call of Duty
ghosts there was a huge difference I
mean positional audio was phenomenal
with this sound card so I can highly
recommend this if you are a competitive
gamer I thought it was I thought I liked
the 5.1 that makes for gaming anyway
what did you guys think did you like it
and if so or if not why and why and why
not so I'd love to hear your feedback on
it anyway hope you enjoyed the test and
that is cmss 3d 5.1 on mix versus stereo
so anyway he's out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
