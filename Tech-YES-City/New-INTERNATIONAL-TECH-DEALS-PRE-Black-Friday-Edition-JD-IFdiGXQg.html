to do this is bryan coming to you guys
today with a deals video now getting
straight into the chase here first up
here we have an LG 27 inch monitor this
is 4k IPS panel free sync supported and
the best thing about it is it costs 452
australian dollars which would be about
330 USD after you use the coupon code so
the coupon code is c20 elf be sure to
get that in there and you'll be getting
a really good deal if you're down on an
australia here in australia you can get
a gtx 1080 finally for a decent price
again Chuck that coupon code in and you
get it for 975 minus twenty percent
which brings it down to about 780
australian dollars if you convert that
into USD maybe like 577 god next one
here is the same deal GTX 1070 founders
edition 688 cheapest one on ebay again
get twenty percent off brings it close
to those us prices if not even a little
bit under now let's get on to those
deals from like people in the states of
United America and the first deal we
have here is the LG 34 you see 88b so
this is like the 1440p it's the better
one and it's the 34 inch curved
widescreen from LG now it's getting
saving here of 272 dollars in griggers
over seven hundred twenty seven dollars
great for productivity also really good
for gaming and whatnot really cool
monitor if you're into widescreen
displays the next deal we have here is
the Intel 600 p 2050 gigabyte m2m VMA
drive this one here is going for eighty
dollars now it's not as good as the APC
I recently reviewed but for that money
for eighty dollars it's a really decent
solution for the money now if you like
CPU coolers you can get the NOC shua NHD
14 now there is the d50 now but it is a
bit more expensive this one at $68 is
really much to in the same as the d 15
it's just not the latest and greatest
though it will perform like the latest
and greatest huge cooler $68 get
yourself a deal there now moving on to
power supplies here we got the EVGA 700
watt be one power play so you can be one
with this past by especially for fifty
dollars really good deal I like it now
if you're into 5.1 surround sound setup
this one is for you especially if you're
a teenager and go and get this thing for
$66 set it up in your bedroom and then
when you bring your teenage girlfriend
around you just tell you spent half a
grand on this thing and she'll probably
believe you know because she's a
teenager to she'll be like what so there
you go get this awesome deal and you're
gonna be living it up alphabets last
deal we got here the RX 470 this is the
X of X edition cheapest one I could find
its one hundred eighty dollars there's
also the azuz going for a hundred ninety
dollars and it's also got a ten dollar
the mail in rebate so if you want a
better cooler on there i'd probably go
with the Strix but if you're looking to
save the fastest buck possible then the
XFX RX 470 is definitely going to be a
few very powerful card for the money
really awesome now what about with Black
Friday coming up some tips and tricks is
to have your browser's loaded have all
those favorite stores like amazon newegg
and all those places load it up with the
refresh button ready also have your
credit card prepayment ready to go
otherwise you may come into some trouble
because this is going to get nasty
fellows on Black Friday when the really
good extremely good deals come up they
only lost four seconds or minutes at
best so you got to be quick on those
basically if I make a video on black
friday deals by the time you get the
video those deals would have already
been gone anyway I hope you enjoyed this
video if you did then be sure to hit
that like button and let me know in the
comments section below do you like these
tech deal videos if so I will try to
bring some more to you maybe even a
weekly series because it certainly helps
everyone everyone loves deals I love
deals maybe even get some gum tree
hunting in there as well who knows stay
tuned and I'll catch you in the next
tech video very soon peace out for now
