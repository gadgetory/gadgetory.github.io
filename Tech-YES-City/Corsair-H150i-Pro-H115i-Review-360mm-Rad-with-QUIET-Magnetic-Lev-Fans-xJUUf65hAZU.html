coolers from Corsair one being the H 115
I Pro and that is kind of like the Big
Brother to the H 110 which is already
the big brother to the H 100 and then
we've got after that the H 150 I Pro
which is another big brother over the H
115 I pro so that's a lot of Big
Brother's here but today we've got a 360
mil rad with three magnetic levitating
fans so these things are extremely quiet
and I'll let you guys take a listen at a
hundred percent max load
so that noise test wouldn't mean a whole
lot if we didn't have something to
compare it to so let's put up the H 110
I with its fans on 100% max speed
so from those noise tester you can see
that those ml fans are making a huge
difference for noise and you don't lose
a whole lot in temperatures yes the
previous fans will blow a little bit
more air but they run so with being a
lot more noisier so I'll let you guys
take a look at the results here and when
we have the 360 mil rad Corsair asked me
specifically with this cooler to test it
on some real big heat so I decided to
put the 7900 X have 4.5 gigahertz under
this cooler and it handled it absolutely
fine we go up to 91 degrees and keep in
mind this is in a 30 degree ambient
environment and then I put the H 115 I
Pro on and that's got around about 94
degrees so what's 3 degrees hotter than
the 360 mil hate 150 I Pro and the H 110
with its fans scored in the 91 degrees
as well but when I changed over to the
magnetic levitating fans that scored in
at 94 degrees as well so there isn't
really a whole lot of the difference
between the H 115 and the H 110
not much of a difference besides the
obvious RGB if you look at the b-roll
already yes both these coolers the H 115
and the H 150 carry an RGB on the base
plate itself now you can control this
vehicle says link software and this will
bring up temperatures and you connect a
little USB port into the cooler and then
attach it to a USB 2 out on your
motherboard and this enables you to
control things like the different colors
now probably on 2 sides of the fence you
really like RGB you can set the color
and call it coordinate at to your build
or you don't like RGB you think it's
gimmicky but if you're one of those
people who thinks a gimmicky this one
has a really cool feature with relations
to temperatures got three different
levels there you can set the degrees in
manually and also with that you can put
a max level so for instance if I don't
like my cooler getting over 95 degrees
on the CPU I can set that to purple so
if I see my cooler light up purple then
I know something's in trouble I should
stop doing whatever I'm doing and maybe
think about turning my computer or the
settings down and tuning that cooler as
well so that was the coolest thing and
no pun intended on that one with both
these brand new coolers the RGB is also
functional as well as being good on the
aesthetics and also with that the
corsair link software you can leave that
up to your keyboard mouse
case and everything in tandem and have
really cool lighting effects this is
just another link in the chain if you
need it though as we saw what those
other two coolers the deep cool and also
the gigabyte the air cooler I started
throwing the mix here they both failed
on the X 299 set up the 7900 X was just
too overwhelming the deep cool almost
past got about 15 minutes into the test
but the Gigabyte cooler almost failed
instantly and keep in mind I was testing
all these temperatures at a hundred
percent fan speeds across all different
models to give you guys an
apples-to-apples comparison so you know
the max potential of these coolers now
onto installation with both these
coolers it is just a breeze it's so easy
it's so straightforward the instruction
manuals laid out really well you can
also download the instruction manual if
you need to it fits practically all
sockets that are relevant even LGA 1366
this thing will fit you've got a m4
support as well for brand new AMD
motherboards and the tr4 if you need a
bracket for that because it is a
specialized bracket you can message
Corsair and get that bracket sent out
with this cooler now talking a little
bit more about both these models they
both have braided cables and they are
quite sturdy and also at the base of the
cooler itself you get an aluminium base
plate and Corsair tell me that they have
improved the pump to be more efficient
in that it makes lessen noise than the
previous H 100 and the H 110 and in
practice I really couldn't notice a
difference I thought the H 100 and the H
110 were already really quiet serveral
both these coolers are really impressive
especially for all-in-one units that you
just get out of the box install them
with these and they'll give you really
good temperatures coming close to even
that of custom water coolers and beating
air coolers by quite a bit especially
with those higher thermal package CPUs
like the 7900 X that we tested here
today this thing will keep it under
control at 4.5 gigahertz which is a
pretty good overclock for the tank or
7900 X though with that said
the H 159 product comes in at 140 retail
in USD the 360 Milverton the H 150 I Pro
that's coming in at a hundred and
seventy US dollars so in that and if you
are in Australia the good news is the
pricing is a little bit better than it
was in some of the previous generations
cor says products so 199 USD for the H
115 I approach and 239 AUD for the H 150
I pro so what you're getting for the
money is actually pretty good
considering you're getting those
magnetic levitating fans they do a great
job of remaining quiet and pushing a lot
of air through although they did lose a
few degrees in performance especially
compared to those 140 mm fans on the H
110 they did come in with a lot lower
noise the 140 mm fans on the H 159 Pro
did an extremely good job that only ran
three degrees in terms of lower in the
overall package and keep in mind this is
on a 70 900 X if you were to put this on
an 80 700 K the difference would be even
less so the magnetic levitating fans I'm
a big fan of them oh pun intended and
the H 150 I pro the 360 Milverton that
thing is a beast of course the 120 mil
versions of the fans they do run a
slight bit louder and also with that
they do push a little bit less air but
you do get three of them and you do get
a big radiator with the H 150 I Pro and
hence that allowed it just to edge out
the H 115 and also one more thing that I
haven't mentioned yet it with the H 115
a pro just like the H 110 is it is
actually a 280 Miller ad not a 240 and
with that it's a hundred and forty mil
so sometimes it can't fit in cases where
the 240 ml rad will actually fit
especially at the top of the case this
won't fit I'll actually have some
problems as witnessed when I've done
builds in the past with the 570 X for
example and even quite recently with the
fractal define r6 so it does need a
special case if you want to mount it to
the top but a lot of times it will mount
to the front of the case with ease it's
just you'll have to rework the fan
configuration but with that said two
great coolers coming with some pretty
aggressive pricing especially for what
you're getting with the Maglev fence
anyway guys that's about it for today if
you enjoyed this video then be sure to
hit that like button and let me know in
the comment section below what you think
of the RGB and the magnetic levitating
fence is this a cooler that you could
use in one of your builds I'll probably
be using one of these in the near future
in a build especially that's
three-sixty milk rad and there's three
ml fans there really whisper quiet and
I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
