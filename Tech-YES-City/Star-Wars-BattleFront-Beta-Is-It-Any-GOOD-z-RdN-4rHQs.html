so it's finally time to take a look at
Star Wars Battlefront beta now this was
free to play over the weekend and I
definitely got some good hours in now my
sort of review on this is going to be a
little bit biased since I am a huge Star
Wars fan boy and I have been since I was
a kid and I've watched all the movies up
until the recent one which I'm gonna go
see on the first day as well so let's
take a look firstly at the some gameplay
commentary footage today and now this is
again the graphics you got to look at
this first off amazing i mean the
textures just look really crisp really
detailed and then we move on to the
sound I mean wow was i impressed of what
they've done with the sound I mean we've
got all everything when you win a pod
for example you get the Imperial March
theme song coming on if you're the
rebels you'll get the theme song for the
rebels and of course you've just got the
guns and this is the main thing I'm
really liking about this game is the
feel of the guns and the sound of the
guns as well I think they've done a
great job in getting the guns right and
hopefully I'd like to see more guns and
I can't wait to see that once the games
released and then we move on to the
characters I mean look at the characters
they look really good I mean I'm
Imperial at the moment which you know
they represent cleanliness hygiene and
all that good stuff and I'm just taking
out some rebel scum you know some filthy
rebel scum and now this is a mode called
drop zone mode essentially where the
skate pods fall from the sky and then
you have to go get the pods and then
defend them and whoever defends the most
pods wins the match now the beauty about
this matches there's just a lot of
dynamics to it for instance if you're
fighting over one pod for a long time a
second one will drop down and then
you've got to fight for two different
pods at the same time and this just
really opens up a new different
experience which i haven't tried before
so I really like what they've done with
this mode and honestly just because of
this mode alone I'll be buying this game
it's definitely sort of brings in a cod
feel for those cod players out there the
call of duty players you're definitely
going to like this mode as it sort of
appeals to the twitch shooter I
definitely had a lot of fun especially
with the bullet
history in this case the laser registry
which when I'm firing my lasers they're
actually hitting as opposed to
battlefield 4 when I was firing guns I
had a lot of problems especially when it
was initially released so a lot of Star
Wars and battlefield fanboys are going
to be very pleased with this game and me
myself included I am just really
impressed with how this game was playing
especially over the weekend now onto
that thing the sounds now back on to the
characters and the sounds they just
looked gorgeous and they've done a good
job especially when you got things like
the lightsaber sounds coming in the 80s
tea sounds the 8080 walkers and then
when everything just little things like
the escape pods opening they've really
done a good job on the graphics and the
sounds and that's coming from the
battlefield 4 engine I believe they're
using the same engine as they did in
battlefield 4 but this time around that
definitely made a lot of improvements
for instance the bullet reg definitely
feels all the laser registry definitely
feels a lot better this time around so
me running around actually shooting
people my guns are actually registering
so I can actually kill enemies properly
in this game that's the Star Wars
Battlefront beta as opposed to
battlefield 4 I found a lot of the times
I had a lot of trouble actually just
shooting people and actually killing
people so if you guys are coming from
sort of that frustration you'll be
pleased to know that it doesn't really
follow into battle front however on that
note with things improving I would like
to see them fix the vehicle combat I
thought for instance the air battles
were just terrible straight out terrible
i mean i'm flying an x-wing and i'm
literally pulling my mouse from right to
left about 10 times just to get the
x-wing to turn around and then even when
i'm in the air i lock onto a target is
gone in one second and i end up crashing
into him and that's pretty much an air
battle so I think the air battles really
need a lot of work i mean the TIE
fighter seems a lot better than the
x-wing for what it's worth but I wasn't
enjoying that and when ever I saw one of
those tokens I would kind of just run
the other way and or if I did get it I
wouldn't
and open it up and then we've got Luke
Skywalker and Darth Vader who just feel
really good when you get the hero pick
up you'll jump into Luke or Darth and
Luke's more agile he's faster and
quicker and then Darth Vader's more of a
tanky boss so they're definitely a lot
of fun and then you're moving on to the
improvements so more improvements this
is drop zone mode and obviously that it
raises the question of are we going to
see more character customization are we
going to see more guns for instance the
sniper rifle that was a card and that
worries me because if there's only one
sniper rifle in the game then that's not
going to be a good thing so I'd like to
see more guns in general and a lot more
customization in the characters though
I'm sure that's going to come with the
release of the final version is has only
been the Bader and obviously they're
only giving you a little chunk of the
game just to test out and see if you
like it and honestly I was very
impressed with the core engine of the
game I felt it played really nicely it
was smooth and it's definitely there's a
lot of a potential there besides things
that could be improved now let's move on
to this athe Walker mode and talk about
a little bit more because there seems to
be a stigma out there that it's just
overly completely imbalanced and that
the Imperials are going to win almost
all the time now that generally is the
case because a lot of people jumping
into the mode I new players but I find a
few other rebels and you do work as a
team and you can get all the Y bombers
to get the raids down and you can pretty
much take out the 8080 walkers in no
time so it just depends on playing the
objective this is just running around
going Yolo now I am a big fan of going
Yolo don't don't get me wrong like I'm
going Yolo in this drop zone mode it's
my preferred style of play just going
yeah okay just going hand with the gun
running around like a cod player and
that's my native style of playing the
game but when you get to the 20 verse 20
man servers you kind of gotta play as a
team and keep on the objective and now I
feel in that regard walking mode
provides a very good appeal to people
who like to play objectives and so it is
a lot of fun just for me as again my
heart lies in Yolo so if it comes to you
know playing Yolo that's me brother give
me a gun that's a twit shooter and I'm
in there just cakin
people so this is essentially a gameplay
today where I am doing just that I've
got the heavy blaster I've got the
jumper pack I've got the shields and
then I've got the grenades now the
grenades are really good you want to
pick up a grenade because the cool down
so low you can just keep throwing them
over and over and then you want to pick
up the shields because there's two
purposes of the shields I find it's
awesome to have the shields because if
you're jumping on a pod and you're
getting a lot of fire you can just pop
your shield and claim the pot
essentially winning the game for your
team or they're not the other thing
about the pod is that you can also now
this is just a weird part of that
orbital strike in there but it went off
in the yonder I really was confused
there but now the shields as well if
you're down on low on health you can pop
the shield and essentially even if it
players on you firing you can regain
health again so the shield is definitely
a must-have in my opinion and then
you've got the third card which is a
jumper pack and now and drop zone mode I
really love this because it'll allow you
to get to the pods faster whether it be
claiming or defending them so in closing
I will say that this game is already
well optimized for pc and ps4 and xbox
one I was actually surprised my brother
was playing it on the console and it was
smooth as butter on the ps4 so I was
pretty impressed there because he has a
console and he loves playing games with
his best for controller so for him is
going to be ordering a copy of this as
well as me especially since I have to
benchmark for you guys this game so I'm
going to ultimately be recommending this
and hopefully they just keep on
improving on the things that really work
especially the versatility of the game
hopefully they keep adding in more
customization they fix the vehicles so
anyway guys that's about it from me I
would love to hear what you guys liked
and what you didn't like about it if you
played it over the weekend tell me what
you thought was bad about the game and
tell me what you thought was good about
the game so I'm looking forward to
