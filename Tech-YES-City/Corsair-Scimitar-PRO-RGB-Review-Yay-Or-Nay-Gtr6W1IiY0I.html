Corsair semitte our RGB Pro which is a
mouse with a lot of buttons more buttons
and even more buttons welcome back to
tech yes City this is brian coming to
you guys today with a look at courses
new semi tom mouse which of course has
RGB lights which can be controlled in
four different regions of the mouse via
the software and can be saved to the
hardware itself this of course will make
your mouse perform better in the
cosmetics department the input lag is
really good on the pro coming in with
comparable levels to my g 302 from
logitech which has some of the lowest
input lag possible so it gets to meet
this mouse to have input lag somewhere
between zero and two milliseconds it
also features a 16,000 DPI picsArt pmw
3367 sensor with dpi adjustments of 1
that's right one on both the x and y
axis which is insane i'd honestly love
to meet the guy who uses 16,000 DPI just
so I can see how they roll adjustments
can be made via the Q software which
also has the options to save three
different hardware profiles and change
the RGB lighting in many different
patterns you can also overlay the lining
with layers kind of like Photoshop which
makes this software not only easy to use
but also very feature packed there's
also the ability to update firmware and
control other devices via the Q software
for instance a k95 keyboard though the
clicks are solid throughout the whole
Mouse with Corsair opting to use the
industry standard which is Omron which
have their own click rating up to 5
million clicks though what about the
shape and construction of this mouse
well it is marketed towards MOBA and MMO
users though in reality I found it to be
a palm grip is Mouse with a weight of
120 grams without cable drag the
finishes are smooth matte black finish
and the right side of the mouse has a
rugged grip for your ring finger the
bottom of the mouse has four Teflon
grips and there is yellow steel accent
running on the bottom of the mouse
through to the left side the scroll
wheel itself is firm and has good
feedback so you will get a relatively
stiff scroll and can use the scroll
click reliably in games beside 12
buttons can also be customized to slide
back and forth
words as to customize for an
individual's hand there's also a 1.6 me
to Braden cable and a two-year warranty
included with the pro lastly there's
also adjustable lift off distance too
though in practice how does this Mouse
perform well I found it really nice for
MOBA games like World of Warcraft for
example where I could remap the keys to
keys that were not in use on my keyboard
then assign hotkeys for those keys and
use them in skills for my Honda for
example which makes this Mouse a really
fun Mouse to give way more options than
a standard Mouse with four or five
buttons that they could only offer the
sensor was also incredibly smooth even
on a few different Mouse mats I had here
and I found even in games like csgo it
performed really well though as for me
personally I do prefer a fingertip Mouse
with small dimensions for daily use so
something like this would be great for a
palm gripper who wants all the
functionality that I could think of from
a mouse and coupled with the excellent
hardware onboard that makes this Mouse
perform as fast as a Logitech mouse and
on that note I can't really fault
anything with it they keep in mind it is
an expensive Mouse coming in at around
currently 67 USD on Amazon and about a
hundred and eight Australian dollars for
Aussies though as with everything you
get what you pay for and this is
certainly a premium Mouse intended for
those who demand the best anyway guys if
you enjoyed this video then be sure to
hit that like button and let me know in
the comment section below what do you
think of courses RGB pro semi Tom Mouse

opinions as always and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
