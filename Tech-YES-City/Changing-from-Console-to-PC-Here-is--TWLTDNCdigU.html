after 22 years of being in the hardware
game Corsair have decided to release an
all-in-one PC fittingly named the one
and today I'm going to be breaking this
thing down
testing it a both stock and overclock
settings and telling you guys if it's
worth your money welcome back to tech
yes City this is your storable
collectible and disposable yes-man
coming to you guys today with a review
of the Corsair 1 which comes in at 1800
USD and you get a gtx 1070 air-cooled
version 240 GB SSD one terabyte hard
drive or you can step it up for 2200 USD
and get a gtx 1080 liquid-cooled 480
gigabyte SSD and 2 terabyte hard drive
and if you're in australia the two
different models will set you back
either 2600 ad or 3150 AUD respectively
the model I have here today is the GTX
1080 liquid-cooled version with the 7700
K and with that said I'm going to roll
some benchmarks in some games at 1080p
and 4k settings for you guys
as you can see in those benchmarks the
Corsair one is no joke this thing
performed extremely well and also does
so with having a very compact and small
footprint to be exact it's 380
millimeters tall 200 millimeters long
and 177 millimeters wide and also has an
all-metal construction on the body and
weighs in at 7.2 kilograms the fan on
the top can also be detached and is a
magnetic levitation or fan which spins
pretty low and is also very quiet and
exhausts all the air at the top of the
case I'll let you guys have a listen to
how quiet this thing is and also show
you the temperatures while I was playing
mafia 3 which is a very power intensive
game actually the most power intensive
game I've tested to date
so with those impressive performance
figures that did all that with only
using 265 watts from the wall so this
also has included a 400 watt gold rated
SFX power supply which is a small
form-factor power play and it does a
great job if you want to overclock your
graphics card I managed to get an extra
two hundred and forty mega Hertz on the
core and also quite a sizable overclock
on the memory this led to a really good
increase in both synthetic and gaming
performance when I was doing the tests
the CPU on the other hand is they catch
22 where as opposed to the GPU which
didn't even go over 60 degrees which is
very impressive considering the size of
this case the CPU came close to
throttling at 4.5 gigahertz which is the
out-of-the-box clock settings for the
7700 K now as you guys may or may not
know this is a problem with the CPU
itself and not the radiators that are
included in the Corsair one and after I
deleted this CPU I literally got a 30
degree temperature drop and I was
managed to overclock this thing to 5
gigahertz now so I got way better
overclock and a huge temperature drop so
the Corsairs 240 millimeter radiators on
both sides of the case are doing a great
job of cooling both the CPU and the GPU
however this is where the catch-22 comes
into play because if you do delayed your
7700 K in the Corsair 1 then you will
unfortunately void your warranty and to
be honest you actually don't really need
to overclock the CPU as it will handle
the GTX 1080 at 4.5 gigahertz perfectly
fine however it is one of those things
that I like to do personally as an
enthusiast though taking a closer look
inside the Corsair one there's two 8
gigabyte sticks of ddr4 Vengeance memory
which total 16 gigabytes and you can
upgrade this however if you do upgrade
this you will have to remove the
previous two sticks and ddr4 memory is
quite expensive at the moment this stuff
comes clocked in at 2400 mega Hertz
however I was able to overclock it to
29:33 effective so it is a pretty decent
overclock and you will get performance
benefits if you decide to overclock the
memory which just like the GPU will
actually not void your warranty if you
decide overclock though on that note of
overclocking the GPU and the motherboard
used
Corsair one up from MSI and in the bias
with MSI if you guys are familiar with
their own biases they're exactly the
same as the one implemented in the one
so you will be able to get in there and
overclock and it is very easy to use and
there are settings that will enable you
to overclock the CPU and the memory if
you wish to though in terms of
overclocking the GPU I just prefer to
stick with MSI Afterburner
and it's very easy to use and will work
fine with this graphics card however
after closing the Corsair 1 up and
taking a look at the inputs and outputs
on the rear you get 33.1 USB type a
ports 1 USB 3.1 C and 2 USB 2 a ps2 port
audio ports which support 5.1 analog and
optical out Wi-Fi antennas and also a
clear CMOS button there's also a one
gigabit per second Ethernet connection
one HDMI 2.0 and to display out and at
the front of the case there's one HDMI
2.0 apps of VI users and also an
additional 3.1 USB type a and looking
closer at the front of the case you may
also notice that there's too light
subtle blue LEDs which is surprising
because I thought they would definitely
be RGB for sure but they're only light
blue and they can be changed by the
software in either breathing mode with
different intervals or you can leave it
on static mode and change the brightness
accordingly and moving out of the sides
of the case there are many little Zelda
Triforce punch outs which allow the
radiators to breathe and moving up to
the top of the case and on the bottom
there's also stick metal fins and at the
top of the case you can actually remove
the fan which is a 140 millimeter
magnetic levitation or fan this is one
of the only two fans included in the one
the additional fan is also on the GTX
1080 or 1070 that cools the vrm and
memory in case of the 1070 it will
actually cool the GPU as well so now
it's verdict time with the Corsair one
and what do I think of it well to be
honest with you guys I am really blown
away by the one it is a great all-in-one
PC especially for a company's first time
at doing this I was really shocked I
mean Alienware and some other brands
could definitely take some tips from
course set this thing performed
extremely well is extremely small and
also made practically no noise while
doing that and you can even get no noise
whilst you're overclocking your GPU and
memory the CPU however that's not course
as fault that's more intel's fault and
you have to deal it though I'd seriously
recommend not deleting it as the Corsair
one includes a two-year warranty which
is comprehensive and I believe is
worldwide so if you have a problem with
anything in your Corsair one you can
take it back to Corsair and they'll fix
it for you no problem you also get
Windows 10 64 bit Home Edition included
and now if you were to go build
something similar in specs to the
Corsair one you could definitely save a
few hundred bucks that's no surprise to
do-it-yourself builders however with the
Corsair one you do get that
comprehensive warranty which is two
years and covers everything and you also
get that kicker small form-factor
all-metal construction so for the
intended market that's people who just
want a hassle-free PC that performs
extremely well enthusiastic levels then
the Corsair what is definitely a solid
product and I can recommend especially
for people who want to come from console
to destiny to for example on the PC I
could see myself recommending this to a
lot of people who just don't want to
build a PC and want something that's
just ready to go and will kick ass in
games anyway guys I hope you enjoyed
today's review if you did - be sure to
hit that like button and let me know in
the comments section below
do you like the Corsair one if so what
do you like about it if not what don't
you like about it love reading your
comments as always and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
you
