voice this memory is still going and
what we got here today is a special
treatment this is the Royal Trident zrg
B and it comes in either two flavors you
can get it in a gold-plated Edition or
the chrome plated Edition and the top is
sort of a special design that refract
the light out sort of like crystals it
does look very nice
it does fingerprint easy however and it
is later to come out in quarter four
with a slight price premium over the
Tritons II RGB it won't be in limited
quantity either so it will be released
all over the world and ready in quarter
for the next moment they're gonna
display here is the Aries this is low
profile memory of course with the
heatsinks but offering as well a more
budget orientated option so the timings
won't be as good as the transi RGB which
is currently their best lineup which
starts at 2800 CL 15 or one point two
five volt and goes all the way to 4600
CL 19 1.5 volt
however the areas will start at around
20 400 megahertz X and P profiles with
CL 15 at one point to 5 volt with a 16
gigabyte kit and going for around about
180 dollars
this will be out later this year in
quarter three as well and with the
area's being the entry level and their
royal try and Z being the top of the
line there's actually a big room there
for mid-range memory and this is exactly
what the sniper X is aiming at some of
these will contain Samsung B die memory
and also there is the Ripjaws these are
both mid-range and they both offer a
different look to one another
of course the sniper X carrying that is
Zeus tough camo gold and black theme as
well as offering some different camo
options su and then last on display is
the flare X memory this was specifically
targeted towards people who are on the
AM for AMD platform and needed their
timings to work because sometimes those
Intel XMP profiles just didn't work on
AMD's platform and with the CPUs so that
flare X was made and designed
specifically tested on AMD's 1800 X and
now of course the 2700 X 4 compatibility
to make sure they work
mm eighteens Computex coverage wouldn't
be possible without gigabyte or Corsair
bringing you the quality and also the
reliability that you need when building
a new pc so here's a really bizarre
thing mid booth ture here we've got a
liquid inside here that pretty much is a
synthetic water except it's non
capacitive non conductive it costs
around a hundred us a leader and it
boils at around 60 degrees and then
condenses again I've never seen anything
like it you can see the RAM is submerged
in this liquid and also there's fins
just pumping it out right in the middle
to the motherboard this is absolutely
crazy and on top of that what makes it
even more crazy is apparently you can
drink it deber√≠as even rumored to have
drunk some already mind-blowing so now
we're over at the peripherals section
and this is the keyboards they're going
to be releasing a 600 series after the
500 and 700 series now the previous
models were already targeted towards
gamers but this time around they're
going for that simple aesthetic mainly
towards the office but still having that
RGB clean look it's still early in the
development stages so there's no num
lock scroll lock or caps lock buttons
and they are offering it in four ranges
of Cherry MX switches coming in with
blue silver red and also Browns
and there isn't elevated and also
depressed models too so if you want that
elevated switch coming in with double
abs plastic key caps too then you can
have that with these keyboards now also
there's a 10 keyless option starting at
around 80 USD that's what they're
targeting with the pricing and going up
to around $100 if you want the numpad
option added on as well
so this is the keyboards they do feel
nice and I am standing beside my
favorite of the bunch this is the detent
key this option with the elevated
switches I must say it looks really
clean it'll be able to be attached to
your computer via a USB type-c on the
left hand side of the keyboard
and that about wraps it up for the copy
text 2018 booth here at g.skill and I'm
wearing a prototype headset on my head
at the moment very lightweight in the
early development stages so there's not
even a price or even the final spec is
confirmed I did want to talk about
but they said look this is just on
display so g.skill if they are good on
the keyboards and the mice then perhaps
they'll be good on the headset as well
remains to be seen but I am looking
forward to it if you guys enjoyed this
video be sure to hit that like button
and I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now
