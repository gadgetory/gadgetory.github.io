Tai Chi review and in the comments
section some people were raising
concerns over the x5 70 chipset hub and
apparently there's been reports of
people going out and buying these
motherboards putting them in a case and
then the whole system is shutting off
and then they think it's due to the fact
that the x5 70 chipset hub is simply
overheating and that will cause the
whole system indeed to shut off but in
my review I didn't really talk about the
platform chipset hub because the noise
was so inaudible compared to the CPU
cooler and also the grabs code cooler
that I couldn't get a proper reading on
the noises and also on that note I
thought the temperatures were fine but
here today we're gonna test out two
different boards the x5 70 Taichi and
also the Auris Pro and then put a 20 80
TI on that test it on the open air test
bed and then after that put it inside a
case and see if we can mimic some of
this behavior that's being reported in
the comment section
so the results now for the open air
testbed on both boards we saw a surface
temperature on the heatsink coming in
with the Auris / y 552 degrees C and
then on the software readout we got 57
degrees there moving over to the Tai Chi
we got 50 degrees C on the surface and
then 57 degrees on the highway monitor
temperature readout both times the
chipset hub was warm to touch I could
easily leave my hand on there for a few
hours and not have it burnt whatsoever
and this is in a 24 degrees C
environment now first off reasons that
we use open air test beds especially for
me as a tech reviewer it's because we've
got ease of access and we can quickly
have access to diagnosing problems and
also visibly see all the hardware and
make sure that's running properly while
we're doing our tests now the main thing
with the open air test bed versus a case
I've done these tests in the past and
basically if you've got a good case or
even a decent case with proper air flow
it will perform better for temperatures
then an open air test bed scenario take
for instance the Corsair 540 that's been
one of my staple go-to cases and it's
been out in the wild for a five or six
years and all you have to do is go out
and buy that case and it comes
pre-installed with all the fans that
will give out better temperatures than
having a test bed set up but from here
in let's put the X 570 Tai Chi inside
the H 500 P which I've got ready for a
transplant and then we'll also load up
an nvme PC a Gen 4 SSD on this
motherboard as well as in conjunction
with the 2080 Ti and load them both out
to see what kind of temperatures we can
get and see if we can indeed get this
board to switch off
and we just finished running tests here
inside the cooler master age 500 p we
had the 2080 TI and also a horas PCIe
Gen 4 nvme drive loaded up on a stress
test so this is pretty much stressing
out the GPU the nvme drive and the cpu 2
all-in-one and what we found here with
the temperatures well actually before we
get into the temperatures I'm gonna
state one thing and that's a really
important thing if you're going out and
spending 300 USD or even 250 USD on an
x5 70 motherboard
please do yourself a favor and do not
cheap out on a case you want to get a
decent case with high airflow or at
least it's got the potential to have
high airflow and you want to add in your
own fans because in this case if you've
got a 20 80 TI and a high-powered CPU
and you're overclocking both of those
and of course you've got an nvme drive
then you will want air flow going
through that case otherwise things will
overheat in this case in particular
we're dumping over 300 watts into the
case so if we don't have good air flow
then things of course will overheat and
they could potentially shut off and in
that case it could be the platform
chipset hub which does that first now in
this case AMD have designed the platform
chipset hub compared to previous two
generations of x4 70 + x3 70
motherboards where I believe they had
the help of as media in designing those
chipsets so it is a little bit different
of course the biggest difference being
PCIe ghent 4 but with that aside let's
get into the results here so the nvme
drive that got on that spot of the
heatsink 54 degrees in both the software
and on the IR temp sense now outside
that area during the stress test we have
50 degrees and then in the software 55
degrees so it was running 2 degrees
cooler then when it was on the open air
test bed and that's still coupled with
an nvme this time around which we didn't
run on the open air test bed so
basically if you've got a good case with
good airflow you won't have to worry
about things overheating so that noise
what you're hearing there it's very
quiet it's very inaudible but even then
the platform chipset hub as I said
earlier we couldn't get out an accurate
reading because and this especially now
we've got extra fans and the GPU was
getting much louder than that platform
chipset hub when we're trying to do the
tests so as it stands with this video I
simply cannot replicate the conditions
to try and get this thing to switch off
and again
this is with the 2080 ti one of the most
power consuming cards out there at the
moment and even then we still loaded up
a Gen 4 nvme SSD and the fans were still
very quiet and the temperatures were
very well controlled and this believes
me to believe that maybe there is a
motherboard out there that could have
issues I'm just not sure but it's
definitely not the x5 70 Taichi nor
would it be the x5 70 or s pro Wi-Fi and
on that note pretty much every x5 70
motherboard except the real high-end
expensive flagship models will have the
active cooling onboard though if there
were issues out there in the wild I do
believe they could be possible but if so
I would recommend updating your BIOS
straight away perhaps the fan might not
even be turning on there could be a bug
where the software is not polling to the
temperatures and so the fan may not even
be spinning up altogether and in that
case that could cause overheating but on
that note of x5 70 motherboards and the
platform chipset hubs thermal trip
points AMD themselves have actually left
it to the motherboard manufacturers to
implement their own safety thermal trip
points and from what I gather from a
Zeus it's 95 degrees Celsius and asrock
is 105 degrees Celsius I'm not sure on
orous and also MSI's values yet but when
I find them out I will update the
description for you guys though when it
stands - a motherboard switching off it
is of course possible to happen
especially if that fan is faulty and
it's not spinning up at all or in other
cases where the motherboard manufacturer
has made a mistake and the fan profiles
are just simply not aggressive at all
and though in other words they don't
spin up until a certain temperature and
even when they do spin up they're just
too quiet and the platform chipset hub
the heat being dumped from massive grab
guard nvme drives is simply overwhelming
that over time and that could see the
whole system switch off especially if
you couple that with a cheap case but
from here on in with my x5 70
motherboard reviews I will be reporting
on the x5 70 chipset hub especially the
fair noises and if it presents a problem
basically if you can touch that heatsink
our general rule of thumb with computers
if it's lukewarm to touch and it's not
really sizzling your fingers at all then
there's nothing to worry about but if it
is getting extremely hot to the point
where you touch that heatsink on any
part in a computer and it's just really
sizzling hot then that's when you can
start to look into it and it may present
an issue or a problem but in this
situation on the Auris Pro and also the
x5 70 there was absolutely nothing to
worry about I could leave my hands on
that thing for days and it would be
getting lukewarm which is a good thing
in winter if my hands are pretty cold or
if I'm playing games you know when
you're playing video games and your
hands get pretty cold and you can't move
them that quick then maybe you could use
your x5 70 chipset hub just as a little
hand warmer and then get back to gaming
but the last thing to touch on before I
get on out of here is the clearance
between that fan and also the GPU there
may be a GPU out there that has a very
low clearance and that's actually
blocking off that fan completely on the
chipset hub that could be another
problem I haven't run into any of those
issues even though this Ora's 28 ETA is
a massive card
there's still a few mil clearance so the
air for the fan can still reach that
platform chipset hub and not cause any
problems and if it does worry you enough
at least on the x5 70 boards here
there's three PCI gen 4 16x slots so you
can just move it down to a slot down the
bottom and then the chipset fan will
have plenty of room to breathe and
without a side I hope you enjoyed
