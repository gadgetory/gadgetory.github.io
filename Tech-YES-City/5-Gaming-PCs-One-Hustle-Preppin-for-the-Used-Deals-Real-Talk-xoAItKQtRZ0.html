little bit of a break but I was also
busy behind the scenes making a heap of
pcs and this is the last of the pcs
we're gonna make here because I want to
clear this out because when we do
another use parts hunt there will be
more of those good parts coming in and
so I want to keep the flow going as well
as the fact that I do believe graphics
cards like even gtx 1060 gtx Tim 50t
eyes and stuff like that I believe
they'll be coming down in price is very
soon I'm already seeing rx5 70s and 5
80s up on my local gum tree and this is
an Australia where crypto is obviously
not as popular as it is in the US where
power is cheaper in the US power is
cheaper and practically all other parts
of the world so if this is happening in
Australia I'm positive it's gonna be
happening all over the world so I'm in
kind of a rush here I call it the haka
ting I got a hawk all these parts off
because there's gonna be so many more
cheaper parts coming in so today I'm
gonna take you through what we're gonna
do to sort of get these things up and
prepped for sale when you're dropping in
a 1050 in this also a 1050 small
form-factor and this here as well and
then here we also got a gtx 750ti so I
believe this systems like an i-5 760
won't need a whole lot done to it with a
750 Ti it'll play games really well with
8 gigabytes of ddr3 that's what we need
to do that PC this one here as we said
before drop in a 1050 we've got
ourselves a gaming PC and see with this
here this over here is actually built to
order someone is going to come pick this
up later today they also wanted a 1066
gigabytes so we picked that up on a
crypto deal I made a tweet on Twitter
about that picked it up whereas
exchanged some Bitcoin so I changed
exchanges in cash versus a
cryptocurrency that I have a bit of a
exchanger for Bitcoin and then paid for
this graphics card with cryptocurrency
pretty crazy and they also even threw in
a gigabytes of ddr3 as well so got a bit
of that goodness and that's one thing
about pcs at the moment ddr3 RAM is
probably becoming the most scarce of all
parts but we still have to go hit the
road and it's the Commonwealth Games at
the moment so traffic might be crazy but
we're gonna hit the road
go pick up a case of power supply also
ten to ten fifty small form factors and
then we're going to put all these four
pieces together in one for PC parts
hustle special edition today here for
you guys
so we just landed back in the studio
here we've picked up to 10:50 load
profiles they've gone pretty cheap like
130 USD a pop so they're gonna make
those two builds they're complete
we've also got a budget power supply
here I'm just checking out to see if
something like this would be okay
it does say it's got two 20 amp 12-volt
lines there so that was like a $20 power
supply and she's gonna see if it's okay
because sometimes you only need to build
the needs like 150 watts with like a
temperature TI and an i7 or something
and so like that would be absolutely
fine the person that's thought he did
recommend I get the case comm 700 watt
pounds posi reckons these are the best
bang for buck especially if you just
want to power someone like a GTX 780 rig
and you don't want to go spend out like
a hundred dollars on a power supply
which you're not gonna get back in a
used build and then we've got two cases
here we've got a bid finish comrade and
also a another case calm this one I
believe has the actual case itself plus
one of these power supplies installed
too so that being said we do have to get
this bill done pretty quick so we're
gonna rush that out now and then we'll
work on these other three pieces here
so there we go guys we've got the one PC
was complete and that's all that's left
of him now so we'll put that over there
and now we're going to make three more
pcs as well so that other PC it actually
did take a little bit longer than it
otherwise would have because they came
around and like the gigabyte board that
I put in the p55 it didn't post it had
some problems on it and then I had to
put in that azu speed 55 board that I
got in Thailand and that worked
absolutely fine but it's sad because I
really wanted to use that board to do
some really extreme overclocking with
the next 34 40 or something like that
but anyway it ended up working out it's
just I've got to figure out what's wrong
with a gigabyte board but without a
slide let's get these other three pcs
here completed built and working so I
quickly figured out what the problem was
and it was exactly what I had warned
about in yesterday's uh parts cleaning
tutorial where the if your break
cleaning down these especially the CPU
socket inside make sure it's completely
dry and see it's working absolutely fine
now and that's because I put a hairdryer
on that CPU socket and fully dried out
all those little SM DS in the middle of
the pins
so now we got the first of the PCs
booted up and this is a weird problem
that I found the other day when I was
playing around with another one of these
Dell pcs we're in the BIOS here but only
a Logitech G 100 Mouse will work and
that's to get over to this option here
to change the boot priority to a USB
storage device so I've tried like a bank
you Mouse as well and Zowie I've tried
the Corsair Mouse tried actually a few
others the only one that's working
around here is this Mouse for some odd
reason so that's a pretty cool thing I
mean unless it does work that if you
guys are having a problem where you
can't get your PC to boot in a Dell box
like this I want to have one of these
lying around this actual computer has a
speaker on mind-blown
so now we're just finishing up the last
of the three pcs here and this one's got
this cool little LED light on the top
but what we're going to do now is put
them all on the table and just snap some
photos so I usually just use my
smartphone for snapping photos and then
just yeah send them across to my PC and
then put the pcs up for sale
so now we just finished those three pcs
I've still got to think about what to
price them up but in one of the shots
one of them still has left the i7
sticker on there because you can use
that as a little bit of a selling point
like generally if it has an i7 and a
people will be like oh wow it's an i7
that's better than an i5 and so that
just adds value and so if you can think
of anything that makes presentation look
good as well as looking like it adds
value to a deal then you will be selling
that deal a lot better than someone
who's just posting a photo of a computer
in their bedroom and it looks lazy
people don't want to buy pictures or
computers that they think the owner
hasn't taken care of basically and so
with all these pcs you've seen it for
yourself in this video I've cleaned them
all out
I've even tuned them up in the windows
make sure they're all running correctly
and they're snappy and fast as well so
not only am i creating value but I'm
also advertising value as well however
the night is still young and we have a
case here which I picked up for 50
strand dollars comes with a 500 watt
power supply which I'm curious to test
with this gtx 960 which i believe is
actually pretty lightly powered it
doesn't chew up a whole lot of power
despite these two six pins here which
would indicate otherwise but when we
took it apart it was deriving most its
power from the PCIe connection so I
don't think it uses that much power at
all we've got here a h61 motherboard
I actually know h77 we picked this up in
Thailand and I know that it for a fact
that it works with these two sticks of
memory even though they're both blue one
is actually Elpida memory and the other
is SK Hynix so they do work together in
this motherboard I know they don't work
together with some other motherboards
I've tested around here so if I can find
a combination where it works absolutely
fun then I'll be happy with that
brand-new one terabyte hard drive to
make things reasonably snappy reasonably
fast but let's put this bill together
while we still can and time is of the
essence well it's actually not that much
of
yes but yeah let's put it together
so now just completed the fifth build
today and this case is very flimsy I did
actually cut myself because the edges
were so sharp so probably not gonna
build in one of these cheaper case comp
cases again just cuz it's annoying to
build in I'd rather even pay an extra
five dollars for something better even
the Cougar cases are a lot better than
these the power supply however it is
saying it does have dual 20 amp 12-volt
rails so I am hoping that that does
check out because even as stray if it
doesn't check out it's actually illegal
to advertise those figures if it can't
handle those figures so I'm hoping it's
all good there was however no 6 pin PCI
connectors I did have to use adapters so
gtx 960 however doesn't use up that much
power at all we've got an i-5 2400 in
here
it doesn't use up a whole lot of power
two sticks of memory low powered
motherboard one terabyte hard drive we
should be good to go let's boo this
thing up and see if we can actually even
run a benchmark if we can run like a
heaven benchmark well some of that it
should be okay she'll be good for gaming
and also if it passes a stress test too
so we've just finished the UniGene
heaven benchmark and we're running
really well the graphics card is going
to around 75 degrees this is in a 25
degree ambient environment and also you
probably hear this PC is actually really
quiet as well and that overclocked
pretty aggressive to 1500 megahertz out
of the box for a GTX 960 that's actually
really good so really happy with how
this PC is performing especially
considered we've got like a really
budget case and power supply but as I
said in the cleaning pots tutorial the
vrm on this was utilizing all the power
from the PCIe ports so I thought those
two six pins were kind of just for show
and looks like they are so this whole
rig is using next to no power but one
thing I'm gonna do now is put it through
out of 64 and stress test it run it for
a good couple of hours to make sure that
everything's good while the cpu GPU and
all the disks are loaded up but while
we're waiting for that to happen I
thought I'd just sit down and talk real
talk with you guys and tell you what's
going on behind the scenes here with the
channel so now I've got a 264 running in
the background behind me CPU is using up
about 55 watts GPU it's saying it's
using up about 70 watts so it's still
really low in terms of overall power
consumption I will quickly test it from
the wall I'll hook up the water meter
and I'll just quickly show some b-roll
of how much power that's actually using
just over this video here but what we
got to talk about now is quickly my
motivations for especially like today
why I'm selling 5 pcs basically I just
got back from Thailand so there's
actually two reasons I got back from
Thailand and I just saw all these pots
just lying around I just basically in
the last couple of months I've hoarded a
heap of parts to the point where I was
like no way enough is enough and so
today I just put together five pcs gonna
just put them off to sell created a lot
of value because those pieces are
running really nice they're gonna be
great when I put them off a sale songs
we be getting some really good value but
at the same time I'm
making a little bit of money so it's a
great little thrill hunting sort of
thing that I've gotten into and I got it
back into that when the x58 boards were
rocking in years ago on the channels
like dam use parts is so much fun
because you can keep sort of satisfying
that need to keep building pcs because I
realized when I was building new pcs it
was just a lot of fun but building a new
PC is kind of you're not gonna make any
money turn around try and flip a new PC
you're gonna lose money but then there
was another thing that's come up
recently as well and this is the
probably the biggest thing talked about
and that's the cryptocurrency sort of
breaking point so I did make a video on
that we'll put the link up here but it's
sort of coming to fruition now I'm
noticing especially around my area in
Australia there's like rx 570s RX 5 ATS
GTX 10 sixties GTX 10 seventies 1050 T
eyes they're all coming up for sale now
and it's only a matter of time before
these people actually want to start
selling these before they start dropping
the prices and now when they drop the
prices I want to be cashed up and be
able to pick up some really good deals
because I just know that they used parts
hunting you guys will just love some of
the deal hunting that I can sort of
hopefully get on to and just crack some
really good deals I know you guys would
want to see that bogan curt hunting them
deals I'm looking forward to it but I
think it's gonna happen I don't know if
it's going to happen for certain but I'm
just noticing this trend now where all
these GPUs are coming up so if those
GPUs are coming up then maybe that'll
indicate that it's more of a buyers
market and so if I've got all this stuff
I need a sell I'd rather kind of try and
sell it now instead of it becoming a
buyers market then you just get
low-balled left right and center so I
can kind of see this trend happening
even sort of live in motion now so I
want to be ready for it when it does
fully hit that bottom point that's just
my thinking I mean I don't know in the
US yet like I said I don't think it's
actually reached breaking point in the
US but I know in Australia kind of has
at the moment so you're seeing people
starting to self their GPUs at least
here and so even if it stays at this
level
maybe the deal hunting in Australia will
get really good so not too sure about
the US but in Australia the moment it's
a starting to be
looking like it's good times but no guys
hope you enjoyed today's video if you
did then be sure to hit that like button
let me know in the comment section below
have you got any really good deals
lately or have you seen any good deals
that you missed out on love reading
those comments as well and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye
to do this to me
how could you do this to me so now we
just landed back from going to the wires
that autofocus off okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
