is brian is he coming back to you guys
today with a video about ram more
pacifically 1600 speed Ram versus 1866
speed ram and is there a difference for
gaming so let's have a look at the
results here and there's some of the
results are pretty surprising I ran
these tests so many times just to
validate it and just to make sure that
everything was checking out ok and yes
this is what I got look here the cow
shocking this is this is so if you guys
are not changing any settings at all for
your ramen bias you're missing out on a
pretty big chunk of performance in some
games obviously in other games not going
to make a difference but I'll get onto
that later as we can see here in Skyrim
the
worst case scenario versus the best case
scenario this is for RAM only this is
not all the CPU and GPU settings were
the same and this is what was happening
13% difference from worst to best case
scenario and that was huge so if you
guys aren't changing your RAM and at
least enabling the XMP profiles which
I'll show you later how to do in this
video you're missing out on a reasonable
chunk of performance in some games and
so it's important to do this if you are
using the auto XMP profile the good news
is that it's a pretty solid overclock
it's a really good overclock as I saw
here it netted me very solid results it
compared to my sweet spot overclock the
XMP 9920 for overclock which is what I
was doing before I wasn't doing a simpie
I was just dialing these numbers in
before I actually spent a lot of time
with this Ram overclock was that it was
a pretty good result it was getting
solid results and obviously I got to
2010/11 1032 and that didn't really make
a difference so I decided that my sweet
spot 24/7 overclock was going to be 1866
910 930 so let's move on to other games
so let's have a look at black ops 2 with
1600 speed Ram 11-11-11 28 so these are
timings and guys I'm bringing out the
RAM overclocked tutorial soon ok so I'm
going to explain all these timings I'm
going to explain all this mumbo-jumbo
soon but in the meantime we're just
going to see the results here the auto
setting versus my sweet spot overclocked
for RAM now only netted a 2.3 2% in
black ops 2 so that was not not much of
a difference in World of Warcraft 64-bit
the difference was almost 10% so
these runs were as identical as I could
get them though very accurate and it
just showed that if you guys aren't
changing any settings for your RAM and
BIOS then you're missing out on a chunk
of performance and so people are
probably wondering why is this RAM
overclocked why is this auto setting so
bad and I put this down to the tier ass
it's one of the timings this last timing
here is called the T rest and if this is
too aggressive which on the auto
overclock it on the Auto clock not
overclocked on the auto clock it is C
it's - it's way too aggressive it's 28
and when I relax that to 32 it made a
reasonable difference so I'm putting
that down - the RAM just simply not
being in sync as well as just being
pretty slack the timings are just too
relaxed but when I relax the cheer ass
on the auto overclock it actually netted
me a pretty significant difference so I
think I'll put that down to this tier as
just being way too aggressive that's why
this Auto clock is just so bad so in
conclusion let's have a look so I also
did some multitasking as well so I did
some light multitasking Styles listening
to a song on YouTube and I'll skyping at
the same time at 1600 speed 99 24 and
1866 my sweet spot overclocked and as
you can see here it was consistent the
frame drop was consistent among both
time so I'll just pull up the fraps logs
here the averages dropped by about 2 or
3 frames and so on both speeds so this
means that Ram if you guys are light
lightly multitasking and playing games
is going to be no difference as well
between 1600 and 1866 on an Ivy Bridge
that being said there is one instance or
I could probably think of a few where
Ram speeds will make a difference and
that is if you're a gold farmer if
you've got 20 applications of World of
Warcraft open at one time and your gold
farming then you probably want to get
some really high speed ram so but as for
a normal person 99.9% of gamers out
there just having 16 out of speed ram
will be absolutely fine and the good
news is is that all the ram I've
recommended in the past will easily
overclocked to 1866 and I'm going to
show you that in the Ram overclocked
tutorial especially Corsair Vengeance
g.skill all that stuff with the
heatsinks on it that'll Rover clock to
1866 no prob
at all so in conclusion guys I will say
1600 speedram versus 1866 there was
pretty much not much of a difference at
all and this was 2% at best and even
then I didn't tweak the 1600 speed as
best as I can I just spent like I was
like ad 1866 and I was like cool I'm
going to focus on 1866 speed overclock
and find the sweet spot there so if I if
I I think if I spent more time at 1600 I
could have basically got the same
results as 1866 so in conclusion there's
pretty much no difference at all the
main point to take out of this video is
that you should not be using the audio
settings okay so if you guys aren't
changing your RAM at all in BIOS then
you should be and basically this comes
in the form of either enabling XMP
profiles or dialing in the settings
yourself and I'll show you guys quickly
how to enable the XMP profiles before I
do my RAM overclocking tutorial video
which I'm going to spend a lot of time
doing I'm going to show you guys a lot
of settings so let's get on to that and
I'll show you how to do it
okay guys so basically I want you to
start your computer and just enter BIOS
so you get out of the by eating the
Delete key or usually the f2 key and now
once you load up the BIOS screen you'll
get a screen that looks similar to this
if not looks exactly like this now every
boss from different manufacturers will
look different so if you have an induced
motherboard or if you have a gigabyte
motherboard the BIOS may look different
this is the asrock UEFI BIOS now I want
you to go over to overclock Tweaker and
I've reset everything back to default so
for this for this little tutorial I've
reset everything else back to order so
as to not confuse you guys with any
numbers and less if you want you to go
down to RAM configuration or DRAM timer
configuration and as you can see here my
ram has two XMP profiles it's got a ddr3
1600 speed and a ddr3 1860's speed
profile so for me
I'm not going to go as one point six
volt 65 volt
can be in some cases a little bit down
for Ivy Bridge so I recommend you guys
just load up the 1.5 volt XMP profile
for now until I go over some when I do
my ram overclocking tutorial I'll show
you guys a lot more in depth and I'll
explain things a lot more in depth but
in the meantime if you haven't done any
other
for your round just go to here load XMP
setting and I want to load the 1600
speed 1.5 volt XMP peripheral and that's
what you do hit that and then your Ram
will then configure itself to these
timings and as you as you saw in the
benchmarks these timers were a lot
better well I had 999 24 dialed in
manually before that but these this
timing will net better results than the
auto it alot better results so you want
to be loading this XMP profile up so all
you have to do is load XMP profile and
then go save changes in exit that's all
you have to do and you'll get yourselves
a nice little overclock guaranteed Oh
clapping around ok guys so in closing I
will say I hope you enjoyed this little
quick a bunch of tests that I ran and
the little guide to enabling the accent
be profiles and that's the main thing
you should at least be doing and what an
XMP profile is is basically a guaranteed
overclock for your RAM so this is what
the manufacturers have said all RAM runs
at this speed and now I'll be talking a
lot of more about this of the different
settings and things about RAM and my
overclocked tutorial when I make that
I've got to spend a lot of time on that
and I want to make it as easy as
possible for you guys and so if you guys
if you enjoyed this video today please
give it a thumbs up and if you haven't
already and you're a yes man then please
subscribe to tech yes City and feel the
power of you yes oh yeah so hey guys
peace out for now and stay tuned for
Tech Talks so sorry Tech Talk got
delayed because of this video I spent a
lot of time on it and researching it and
also I've had I got the flu so I've been
down and out for like a few days so yeah
whatnot who cares you know you get sick
so what move on we're going to move on
some of you guys stay tuned for the next
video and peace out for now Brian
