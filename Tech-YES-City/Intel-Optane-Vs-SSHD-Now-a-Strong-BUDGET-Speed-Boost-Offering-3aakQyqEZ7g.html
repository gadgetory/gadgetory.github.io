a faster piece of storage and combining
it with an existing slower type of
storage whether it be a one terabyte
hard drive or a two or three or four
terabyte 7200 rpm drive and making your
whole system faster in general and in
today's video we're focusing on just
this with Intel's obtain 16 and 32
gigabyte modules which come in an
Australia priced really well at $28 for
a 16 gigabyte module and $49 for the 32
GB our modules in the u.s. they are a
little bit more expensive with $34 at
least on Amazon for the 16gb of module
and $57 for the 32 gigabyte module how
was that aside let's test Intel's claims
and see whether this does indeed make
your system more responsive and whether
it does indeed learn the behavior of
previous applications loaded and speeds
them up for the next boot even after
you've completely turned off your system
gone to bed and then woke up the next
day to boot that game up for the 1000th
time
welcome back to tech yesterday today's
video is sponsored by Intel but that of
course does not change the results in
any way shape or form moving on with the
first benchmark we got here Windows 10
boot time one minute and nine seconds on
the hard drive first boot then scales
down to 55 and then 29 seconds moving
over to the sshd and also the SSD and
the octane series the octane series
actually scored the best boot times
after it learned what was going on which
I was surprised it even beat out that of
the 760 P 256 gigabyte M got to solution
and of course beating that of the sshd
which is going to be a big focus of
today's video comparing this against SSH
DS which do offer a similar type of tech
moving on to the project cards to boot
times we scored a victory here for
obtain over the sshd and also the hard
drive the SSD did score the victory
though in this particular benchmark
coming in with for instance the worst
time 30 seconds on the hard drive and
then 29 seconds on the sshd and that did
scale down and even after we rebooted
the machine the octane did beat both
these solutions which is the biggest
focus of these tests is when we reboot
the machine after its learned what's
going on is it still going to give you a
benefit and move over to Premiere Pro
now a benchmark for 4k video editing we
saw 48 seconds and then down to 11 and
10 seconds that after we rebooted on the
hard drive we then went back up way back
up close to those initial figures though
moving over to the opt eight series
drive we did score a big victory here
and a little victory over the sshd going
down to as low as eight seconds and then
rebooting the machine to come back into
ten seconds boot times moving over to a
Google load which is just a browser with
five different tabs that I've decided to
put in we scored four seconds and then
two seconds then two seconds rebooting
the machine saw the HDD fall behind a
little bit rebooting the octane and also
the ssh DS did give us a benefit here
though the SSD did come out on top in
this benchmark and then move over to
another game far cry 5 we did score a
minute and 22 seconds on all four
devices and that followed through with
the previous load times then being
similar scores except when we rebooted
the machine
we did see a little bit of a difference
following that of the trend that we've
seen previously though this game for
what it's worth it does seem to load up
the mp4 files and then load up the game
as you're watching those dedicated mp4
files it is a little bit annoying it
does take a long time to load the game
regardless of how many times you're
booting it and then moving over to Final
Fantasy 15 we did score a big victory
here on the octane series drives
especially after we rebooted the machine
went down from 95 seconds from the hard
drive for example to 32 to 32 and then
spiking all the way back up into the 80s
moving over to the octane series drive
did go down to as low as 31 seconds and
then when we built up the machine it was
37 seconds the SSD did score the victory
here on also the first boot and the last
boot and then that did of course beat
the sshd and that came in third place
movie over pop G again similar scenario
to Final Fantasy 15 hard drive here 55
seconds first go 26th and 26 and then
rebooting and up into the 40's the
octane series drive did come out well
ahead of the hard disk drive and also
well ahead of the sshd the SSD did score
the victory here however of course on
the first boot and the subsequent reboot
and then the last benchmark we're
pulling up is a simulator benchmark
super position where we've got 31
seconds 19 and then 18 and then on the
optin series drive we've got 31 19 and
17 so there was like a very slight
benefit on the third go but when we
rebooted the machine those results did
carry through with the boot time of 21
versus 30 on the hard disk drive and the
SSD again falling in between those two
drives in the SSD of course coming out
on top especially after the reboot so
now the results room we can see that the
system itself it does have the system
acceleration that does learn what's
going on does make game boot times
faster and also does make system
applications faster even after you've
rebooted the machine so it does indeed
do what it says it will do and the
results are showing that in terms of
making a mega storage as well you can do
that with ease and simplicity you can
add it onto a four terabyte solution if
you wish to attend terabyte solution and
in my opinion the value is coming in a
lot better than that
shd and also you get more of that
caching portion available so it is a
good option if you're looking for a
bridge between an SSD and a hard disk
drive and you don't want to go out and
reinstall windows because today I tested
it with a one terabyte 7200 rpm drive
for example and that was a brand new
hard drive if we use an older hard drive
or even a 5400 rpm 2.5 inch mechanical
the results would be even greater some
of those mobile laptops are very slow
and the good news is you can add it to a
mobile solution but it has to be of
course 7th or 8th gen or you can even
add it to the Nook which I recently
reviewed here on the channel also
setting up octane is extremely easy to
do just simply install the module and
then download the software and you're
good to go as well as that there's also
bundle obtained with CPUs and in this
case the gigabyte motherboard I have
here has the opie option we took a look
at this at Computex and they're
currently giving you the m2 heat shield
and also the 32 you give it module for
around a 40 USD premium at least on the
gaming 7 motherboard so that's an option
if you wish to
it doesn't affect performance in any way
shape or form as opposed to a
motherboard without it and then you
purchase it and then install it but it
is good to know if you want this
solution and you definitely want to use
it with existing storage there is an
option available from gigabyte from the
get-go so you don't have to waste any
time installing anything and you do get
that custom looking obtained heat shield
if that's what you want and you conclude
things up out of the three technologies
I've tested here that being obtained ssh
DS and also storing my I feel like
obtained did do the best in terms of raw
performance of course store mi is a
utility that comes for free with
motherboards so there is a difference
there of course of being price but in
terms of comparing idiots SSH DS I
believe it's a no comparison obtained at
least at current prices is doing a
better job and also the performance when
we looked at it compared to the SSD it
actually did score a victory in one of
the benchmarks so it is doing its job
pretty well so it's priced in Australia
very competitively $28 for the 16
gigabyte module which if you've
currently got a hard drive and no SSD
and you've got that 200 or 300 series
model or two seventh HS Intel CPU and
you can add this in in my opinion it's a
no brainer at that current price point
the 32 gigabyte module that is a little
bit more expensive is a bit of a bigger
add in solution I would recommend that
if you've got massive amounts of storage
and you need that extra portion anyway
guys hope you enjoyed today's video if
you did then be sure to hit that like
button let me know if you have any
questions or comments about obtain in

big thanks to Intel for sponsoring out
this video and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
