done really well and stunned way better
than my expectations we've built up a
new studio I've had a lot of donations a
lot of support from you guys and have
done some sponsored content as well and
done various other videos to the point
where I'm doing too well now and I want
to give back and this is gonna be a
three-part series where I'm gonna do
something that I believe in and that's
gonna build five pcs and then give them
to a way to people locally who are
low-income families or their disabled
well they're just simply Sol and with
that I just really want to make a
difference and just give back to all the
people who have gave stuff to me and
instead of doing the traditional
giveaways that honestly they just don't
work you get a lot of people just
spamming on accounts and then they win
something and they'll probably just
resell it this way I can make sure it's
going to make a difference and make
people who otherwise wouldn't have
gotten or be able to afford something
like a gaming PC and put a smile on
their face because when I was growing up
we didn't have money for the latest and
greatest tech or even decent tech and of
course it was a little bit hard when
your friends had the Super Nintendo and
you're like buying the Nintendo for a
real cheap price and you're still
enjoying that of course but sometimes
you just don't get the opportunities
that other people get and that's what
this is going to be about this
three-part series but today I'm going to
be building all these pcs out and then
in part two I'm going to find the people
to give them to and then in part three
we're going to show them through each
and every gaming PC I've never attempted
anything like this before but let's get
on with it and start showing you guys
what pcs are getting built and build
them up
welcome back to take us in what we got
here on the desk is essentially five of
everything so five motherboards five
hard drives five graphics cards and one
of those is even my favorite is an x58
motherboard which will be hosting a six
core 12 threaded Xeon an X 56 60 and
also a 1066 gigabyte now if you guys
don't know what the computer parts are
essentially these will be able to play
all those titles that kids love like
fortnight and csgo and all that stuff
that'll be absolutely no problems for
all five of these rigs and essentially
all these parts here on the desk I get
them either from deals that I hunt
locally for really good prices or people
just donate PCs that they think no
longer work and of course the magic that
I put into him is I'm gonna refurbish
them and make them in a lot of the cases
run even better than brand-new so what
are we waiting for
let's get this party started
so we're now finishing up the fourth PC
installing windows and we're going to
now do the grand finale which is the x58
and the gtx 1060 PC
so here's the fifth PC finally complete
but I've really gotta freshen up quickly
so right here on the desk we've got five
finished PCs they've been revamped
they've been made to look like brand new
and of course perform like brand new
we'll actually maybe perform a little
bit better because I tuned the windows I
over clock the systems to safe levels
and in part one we just built the pcs
here today and in part two we're gonna
find five underprivileged kids and give
all these pcs away and then in part
three we're gonna take them to the kid
and hopefully set it all up and just see
them playing these video games in action
and I hope you guys have enjoyed this
video today it's something completely
new as I said in the intro I've just
been blessed to have the channel go
really well as of late and I want to
start giving back especially locally
where I know a hundred percent of the
proceeds are gonna go towards the kids
in need so anyway I hope you enjoyed
this one if you did then be sure to hit
that like button and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
