6,800 K which is a six core Broadwell e
Intel to a four core Intel which is the
7700 K and then to a Verizon 1800 X
which is an 8 core 16 thread and beast
and now I use these in my main rig and I
talked about this in a video I did where
I'd used Rison after three months and
between all those three rigs
I couldn't notice a huge difference in
terms of slowing down or speeding on my
workflow but today I'm gonna be changing
over in this PC here my main rig yet
again and this time I'm changing over to
coffee lake with the 8700 K though quick
recap for you guys the biggest annoyance
I had with this system was the elgato
capture card not properly working
sometimes with the X 370 motherboard so
today I'm going to switch that over to
the 8700 K and see if that problem
persists in the next few months also
another problem has come up with the
fall creator's update and that is
sometimes after I leave my computer afk
for a very long time
it'll just completely freeze and I'll
have to hard reset it again
so with that aside let's start this
process of changing things around so
currently with this build I've changed
the GPU around a lot and I'm actually
really happy with the galaxy x OC snipe
at 1080 TI it's a white themed gravis
card and it goes really well with this
build actually like the white LED
vengeance memory and of course that X
370 tied she looks so smacking this
build
however the problem is we're putting in
the Z 370 fatality and this time around
it doesn't have any white on it at all
and so I've gone and bought some trusty
spray-paint over there which is white
and we're gonna quickly undo this side
plastic guard thing and also take off
the heat sinks and the bottom heat sink
and spray them up white just to bring a
bit of white back into this build as if
I put this in like that it's going to
not be really a black and white theme to
build anymore in my opinion and yes I
know that cable there looks very off
that's just a temporary fix or successor
see probably looking at this CPU and
this cooler and thinking what did you do
here Brian what I did was when I first
installed Rison I decided to do an
experiment where I was testing mx4
versus liquid metal on the CPU to the
actual cooler and they shouldn't do this
you shouldn't have aluminium and liquid
metal and so what I did was I did the
test and they would like no differences
in temperatures between using mx4 and
using liquid metal on the actual heat
spreader now of course there is a big
difference when you use it on the die
and that's because their heats more
concentrated but on the IHS where
there's much more surface area it's not
such a big difference and so I
completely forgot about it
and now I'm paying the price well not
really a me knows it is is just a little
bit of surface corrosion get that off
slap some mx4 on and it's gonna be good
to go
so the switch is all complete we've now
got the z2 70 heat sinks on the Z 370
motherboard so I don't know what we
would call this maybe a z3 3/5 kind of
something like those Toyota Motors back
in the day when people would put a 1 J
head on a 2 J block I think it wasn't
they'd call it a a 1 J point 1.5 or
something like that so we kind of done
that here so we've got a z3 35
motherboard and what I'm doing this is
because like again I wanted that white
and black aesthetic and the problem was
this time around as rock don't offer any
white and black theme to my other boards
I don't think with the Z 370 lineup and
it's kind of weird because I loved the
look of the Z 270 white and black I also
loved the look of the X 370 tight Ian
now and of course I know the white and
black themes not for everyone but I'd
like to see at least one motherboard in
their lineup that kind of features this
look it really is good really hits home
for me and also Corsair over here have
provided their 960 gigabyte have sent
out another one of these to the channel
so big thanks to Corsair 960 gigabyte
Neutron xti so I'll now have two of
these to raid 0 4 2 terabytes of SSD
storage so that's going to be not only
lightning fast but is gonna be great for
video editing they've also sent out some
of the RGB memory this is ddr4 memory
64gb I kid now this stuff is literally
like gold at the moment because of the
price of ddr4 memory so this stuff is so
expensive but it's really gonna help me
do some awesome video editing and
especially if I want to put something in
a benchmark rig as well this is gonna
help out a lot but with that said let's
get this z33 5 motherboard in
so we've finished the build and it's
going really well I mean the whole build
went really smooth everything's working
except do it now come into two problems
and one of them is not really a problem
it's just something that I've got to
make sure works before I do anything
further and that's just make sure that
my crypto wallet can transfer over okay
so this is in the process of doing that
now but the second thing that we've got
going on here that is a bit of a problem
and a real problem is the drive
configuration in the RAID controller on
the AMD chipset isn't being read at all
by the Intel chipsets so this is like
really tedious even the RAID one drives
aren't showing up at all so we're gonna
have to pull these drives out and then
put them back on the AMD chipset and I
can copy all my daughter over to a spare
drive and then I can make the raid
arrays again on the Intel chipsets so
maybe that's a reason why I don't know
in the server industry I don't know if
that's one of the reasons why people
just don't want to change hardware at
all so here's what we got now to fix
this problem with the raid I've got a
two terabyte hard drive over there and
that's just a drive that's running off
the main chipset so it's running off a
different side of control law so that's
just going to be a standard drive
installed normally like any drive on a
HDI or IDE and then we're going to get
all this data off these drives and copy
it to that drive just the stuff that I
need and then I'm gonna reset the raid
array and hopefully it'll be happy days
you can probably tell by the look at my
face that have come into more problems
and I mean yesterday we had the GT 1030
on that HP machine and that was the
biggest nightmare was a huge failure but
this time around we kind of got like a
semi fail so at least it's better now
with the raid array basically I've put
them in raid 0 and raid 1 I like to get
extra performance out of the raid 0
array especially on the mechanical
drives and then the raid 1 of course
it's the double backup it's the mirror
but this time around year you got drives
disappearing and on top of that I've
installed the raid drivers when I'm
installing windows and then it gets to
0% and it just locks up and then if I
really start the computer the even the
drives in the raid array of disappear so
I'm waiting on aged BIOS update to fix
that up also even possibly a driver
update itself from Intel but at the
moment if you guys are getting on coffee
Lake just be careful if you want to use
a raid setup I mean it's pretty ironic
that Intel's calling this in the BIOS
Intel premium raid I mean yeah that's
premium alright just drives disappearing
out of thin air and then causing
problems but anyway I was gonna say the
difference is so far the first
difference I do notice between the Intel
rig and the AMD rig is somers the Intel
rig boots up a lot faster even with the
raid option enabled so it quickly
initializes the rate control is fast so
I find the Intel systems do boot up a
lot faster than Rison of course this is
both on asrock boards so maybe it's just
the asrock boards but also with the
risin thing I'm actually impressed with
how a stable Rison got and how quickly
stability was introduced on their lineup
of CPUs and motherboards that was really
good I mean even when it was first
released even though there were some
problems it still didn't stop you like I
didn't get anything like this so the aim
DeRay control is really good the Intel
coffee leak rate control I mean please
fix that as soon as possible like it's a
real headache guys I'm just surprised
that it would come out on the Z 370
motherboard because they're pretty kind
of when they have
experience already with z2 7170 which is
very similar so in a few months time
I'll report back probably with another
big video like I did with the three
months on Rison tell you guys the update
on what it's like to be on the 8700 K
versus the rising system but it asides
that the rig is running okay now I do
have to reinstall windows on the SSD the
the nvme drive that is a problem in
itself because it's got the old AMD
install on there I just don't have time
to reinstall the moment so I gotta go to
Bangkok for the Galaxy OC event very
soon and with that it's it's just all a
nightmare I picked the worst time to
upgrade my machine I didn't expect to
get into these this many problems before
I left but I guess that's just how it is
a lot of the times anytime you're in a
crunch it's just like if things can go
wrong they do go wrong when you're time
strapped but anyway guys if you've got
any problems like mine at the end of the
day I would be more upset I would be
more angry if it wasn't for this I mean
look at this this is the gold mic now
with a mic flag on it so when I go to
the gal acts OC event I'm gonna be using
this and we're gonna see people's
reactions they I think they won't be
able to handle this thing but also
besides that if you've got relationship
problems or you've got computer problems
a gold mic with the mic Flags gonna fix
it well but if you've got car problems
the mic ain't gonna fix that I'm sorry
venting that rage is the only thing
that'll fix that but also before I get
on outta here I wanted to talk to you
about the main system and the settings I
use so usually when I tune my main
system it's very similar to the
overclocked tutorials I do like this
system here is gonna be running at 5
gigahertz probably 4.9 just for super
stability like if I'm in the middle of a
rendering a video I just can't have a
crash whatsoever that's a lot of time
lost if that happens but also besides
that the main difference between the
tutorials and everything that you see on
the channel usually is the fan profiles
that's something that I don't really
talk about a whole lot but it does make
a difference right now I've reset the
BIOS so in the background the fans are
actually at their default profile but
what I usually do is I go through and
have
them all at 20% up until at least 55
degrees and then after that I'll just
max them out so basically when the CPU
starts getting stressed it starts
getting hot those fans ramped up and
that's pretty much only when you're
intense a game that uses the CPU
intensely or you're rendering the final
project basically times when I'm not
recording or I don't really need to
concentrate that's when I have the fans
spin down so that's the main difference
with my tuning my main rig versus what
you see on overclocking tutorials which
is just to get the overclocks
set in and also the ddr4 memory I do
overclock that manually a lot of the
times just depends on how much of an
extra overclock I can get over the XMP
profiles I'm actually still tuning this
ddr4 memory here so I'll let you guys
know in the comments how that goes but
also if you guys enjoyed this video then
be sure to hit that like button also let
me know in the comments section below
what drive configuration are you guys
running at the moment love reading your
thoughts and opinions as always and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
