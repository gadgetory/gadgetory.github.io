the bad news is I just wasted five
seconds each time the good news is that
we now have a new level in microphone
I'm also a installed magic lantern on
the video camera so hopefully the
quality of this video is going to be
better
welcome back to take a city this is
brewing as you coming back to you guys
today with a review of the NM axe full
mo qpc case now this is a midsize ATX
case it's retails at $30 and that's what
that the price tag immediately aroused
my curiosity so to speak as I thought
well $30 Animax man what am i what am I
going to expect here so when I got this
case I was surprised I am ultimately
going to be recommending this case
however there are a few negatives and I
will get them out of the way with first
and that is first thing and that is that
the case does it is lightweight and that
can be a benefit and I'll talk about a
bit later but it is flimsy it does feel
like literally it does feel a little bit
cheap and it does feel really light and
flimsy like I could literally if I put
pressure on this I could bend it with my
thumbs so it does feel cheap if you
don't like flimsy cases then you will
not like this case if you're looking for
a more durable case and I recommend you
look elsewhere however the second the
second negative is that it only comes
with one fan installed honestly I would
seriously recommend getting in at least
an additional two fans to put on this
side panel if you are thinking about
using this case I'd also recommend an
additional one fan on the front to cool
your hard drives or SSDs that's all
that's optional but yeah I least
recommend getting an additional two fans
so looking at the front of the case here
we can see it is meshed in steel it also
has one USB 2 port one USB 3 one mic in
one headphone out one reset and power
button now the good thing about the
power button is it actually the light
turns on when the computers off so if
you're using this for a home theater PC
and you're watching movies in the dark
I actually prefer this because you want
to have any annoying lights going while
you're watching your movie now there is
three models of this case one of them is
the u32 which features 2 USB 3 ports on
the front one of the u3 which this is
what this is model actually is the u3
which only has one USB 3 on the front
and one is the u2 which features only
two USB to ports on the front so looking
at the rear of the case here we can see
that there is ample room for cable
management I love this is one thing that
I love about this case already there's a
big cutout here for installing a CPU
cooler as well there's also ample places
here to put zip ties and cable man
with ease also the side panel itself
features a big cutout here so if you are
indeed going to do a lot of cable
management especially like I have with a
650 watt power supply that is non
modular it allows for ease of use and
ease of cable management really good
feature with this case I was really
impressed with the cable manager was so
easy to do even though this is like a
2-minute job it was actually really easy
to do so looking at the rear of the case
here we've got options we've got two
cutouts here for water cooling if you
need to use water cooling that I don't
see how water cooler would fit in this
case you've also got the cutout here for
the 120 millimeter fan which comes
included with the case you've also got
here your this is where your motherboard
goes with your input/output plate and
you've also got an intuitive design here
where the actual screw ins for the PCI
Express Lanes are outside of the case so
I actually really like this because I
can just put my screwdriver in and from
the outside of the case and it's
actually really easier to have to worry
about screws falling into the case and
falling on the motherboard now down the
bottom you can see here there is a rear
mounted bottom amount of power supply
which goes in and out with these as well
so let's take a look inside the case now
this is probably the best part of the
case it's my certainly my favorite part
as we see a straight away there is an
extended cutout here for extra long
graphics cards so if you decide to take
this SSD backplate or the side plate out
you can then put in a graphics card up
to 40 centimetres I believe which is
absolutely massive so they've really
done I really I really like that idea
if you decide to keep this then you can
mount an additional three SSDs in here
looking above that you can mount to five
point two five inch drive bays which for
me personally that's about I like having
the option to mount to five point two
five inch drive bays some people like
only one some people like none but yeah
for me toos okay that's fine
looking here though we can see here
we've got cutouts here for four 3.5 inch
mechanical bees as well and also down
the bottom this is another thing that I
really like with this case it paid
attention to detail we can also mount an
SS 2.5 inch SSD right down the bottom of
the case out of sight out of mind
like that that's what I've exactly what
I've done here and it looks pretty cool
to the left of here we've got a cutout
here for a fan if you need it and also
at the front of the case sorry I forgot
to mention you can
to 120 mm inner or eighty millimeter
fans at the front down the bottom here
to the side of the 3.5 inch driveway you
can mount one 120 millimeter or 80
millimeter fan however I've used that to
put all the extra cables since this is
an online chilled power supply I've used
it to put all the extra cables in an
Nvidia bag where that looks clean and if
you need to use those cables in the
future you can looking at here there's
two fans here which pretty much going to
go back on the side panel as I said
before they're hardwired into the cable
management that couldn't really be
bothered I'm doing it and doing it again
but looking here now we've got here a
fault like you can see here the room is
absolutely it's really good for a $30.00
case I like it better than the z3
because there's more room to move around
here with cable management got a cutout
here we've got three cutouts here and
it's just so spacious inside this case
that's one thing I like about it now
another thing too is that the
motherboard it went on with ease the
screws are already pre-mounted so if
you've got a full sized ATX board this
is actually a micro ATX board if you've
got a full-size main microwave I mean
full sized ATX board you can just put it
in the case and screw it up and you're
good to go I do I had to actually take
some screws out and then put the micro
ATX board in so it will fit Mini ITX
micro ATX and ATX so we'll fit the three
form factors there so in conclusion and
closing out on this case I will say that
yes it is flimsy it is does feel pretty
cheap but it just comes feature-packed
and I don't see anyone coming into a
problem and if you're like me and all
you just do is build a desktop PC and
then it just sits there and it doesn't
get moved then this case is gonna be
fine I mean if you're the type of guy
who rages and occasionally kicks and
boots his PC in this case is probably
not for you you'll probably be putting a
few dents in it and it'll probably break
however one thing I forgot to mention
about the flimsiness it also means that
the case is really light and so if
you're like man you're probably going to
be shipping this thing internationally
or you're gonna be carrying it around a
lot then the light weight of than the
lightweightness
of this case makes it a really good case
for a transport ability or moving around
so I really like that it's just really
cool ultimately I was just really
impressed with it it was a cool looking
case a very sleek slim looking case and
came with loads of options and ease of
access which would really impress me
about this case so ultimately I'm gonna
be highly recommending these product for
$30.00 though if you do decide to buy it
please do yourself a favor and at least
get two fans and put them on the side
panel for nice airflow into the case and
that's about it guys if you have any
questions about a full mode queue please
Liverpool in the comment section below
if you have if you haven't really hit
that like button and I'll be coming back
to you guys soon with a review on one of
those power supplies that I don't want
to review anyway I'll catch you guys
with the tech review very soon peace out
for now and let me know about the video
quality - is it good is it better and
also the audio quality anyway I'll catch
you guys very soon pays off and out and
