the dark coming back to you guys today
with a review of the Fidelio X ones by
Philips now these are a flagship
headphone by Philips it's their best
headphone they're basically an indoor
open-back headphones we'll talk about
the benefits of that later in the sound
signature but first of all let's get on
with the unboxing and we'll basically
the build quality of these headphones as
soon as you get this product shipped to
you you'll notice that it's heavy it
comes boxed extremely well and in a way
it reminded me of Phil add my MSI
Lightning that I got it's basically just
you know the attention to detail that
Philips has paid to this product is huge
it's really good and you can tell that
this is a premium product as soon as you
get the box I mean it comes packaged
really well I don't see this thing
getting damaged in shipping now as soon
as you pick the headphones up you'll
notice that the build quality of the and
the design of these headphones is just
top-class this is the best feeling
headphone I've ever felt like it just
feels like an absolute premium product
you know you pick it up this steel
there's steel on the outer cups here
there's the mesh is really thick and
solid these things feel like they could
take it pounding they're really strong
you've got a metal band here with a nice
hard leather cup here that says Fidelio
X once you've also got an inner band
here which sits on your head and that
lets you make it more comfortable for
the headphones to sit on your head so
definitely for build quality Philips get
a 10 out of 10 this is a really premium
it feels like a premium product and now
I managed I was lucky I'll managed to
get these for a hundred and fifty
dollars on an Amazon deal of the day
special I actually managed to get three
of these you know I can resell them in
Japan make a bit of pocket money but you
can pick these up for around two hundred
twenty dollars on sale and for that
price really they do it's a recommended
buy at that price but we'll get on to
recommendations later let's talk about
the comfort of these headphones which is
where I believe the first there's only
two little minute- points that I'll make
about these headphones and the first
comes with comfort basically the actual
feel of the headphone when I put the
on my head like this they feel
phenomenal these headphones feel great
they fit they lock in really well but
the problem is is that they're just a
little bit too heavy now this is not
gonna be a problem for most people who
are in the casual users or they're
listening for one or two hours at a time
but for a hardcore gamer you know
playing for four hours or five six hours
whatever 10 hours if you're a huge gamer
these will get a little bit heavy on
your head over time now I did manage the
way these on the scale and they
basically weighed about 365 grams just
the headphones themselves so they're a
little bit heavy you know me personally
when I've used I've been using these for
a little I think a month now a little
over a month and yeah you know my next
thought my neck gets a little bit sore
I live not sore but a little bit tired
after real long sessions on these
headphones so the comfort is it's it's
really good but just I think it's a
little bit heavy but at the same time
that heaviness makes it gives it a 10
out of 10 for the build quality so it's
kind of like a little bit of a
double-edged sword there so honestly I'm
gonna give these eight out of 10 for
comfort I just think the real long-term
gaming sessions they're just a little
bit heavy on the ears that's all so I'll
give them an 8 out of 10 let's move on
now to the most important thing the
sound signature the sound quality when I
tried these headphones on you know what
basically essentially what makes a
premium headphone a premium headphone
and in my opinion there's two things
detail and clarity or a soundstage sorry
soundstage and clarity these definitely
have both they're an open-back
headphones so their soundstage is going
to be huge they're basically you know
the baby they've got the biggest
soundstage of a valid from a headphone
it's really you can you know if you if
the sound is really has a lot of depth
to it then you can definitely position
you know where things are especially in
video games now the clarity of this you
can hear all the instruments you can you
know if you're playing rock or whatever
you can hear every single instrument
being separated it's a really good
experience it really does live up to a
premium product headphone so but let's
talk about the second little negative
point of these headphones now the sound
signature is unique if you go check out
the frequency curve
on headphone a or something like that
you can see that they're a bass-heavy
headphone now basically I'm gonna say
first of all if you're an electronic
dance music lover then you are
absolutely gonna love these headphones
these are the best set of headphones
I've ever heard for electronic dance
music for instance deadmau5 that stuff
just comes alive I mean wow when I heard
deadmau5 through these headphones I was
like damn I was like I was listening to
a new version of deadmau5 even though it
was the same music listening to some
dubstep I mean I don't usually listen to
dubstep but hell I was even enjoying
dubstep on these things they're
phenomenal for electronic dance music I
think the sound signature is
specifically suited for that genre let's
talk about when you playing games when
you're playing games it's not the best I
think this best sound for games I mean
honestly I think for gaming you want a
headphone with a bump in the mids these
have a bump in the base but at the same
time that bass gives it that immersive
feeling so if you're if you're listening
if you're playing games and you're
shooting guns for instance I was playing
for the campaign of Call of Duty ghosts
and when I was firing a gun in the water
that bass just really boom boom boom
boom boom it came through on these
headphones it sounded really immersive
it was really good so if you want to get
immersed in your games maybe a bit of
fun
then these definitely have that with the
bass they bring the bass into the mids
and it just sounds really good so for
gaming I can recommend it it's probably
the best for positional as the bass
tends to be a bit exaggerated compared
to the mids and when you you know if
you're playing FPS you're gonna want
mids because that's where the footsteps
all the voices you know the gunfire is
basically in the mid range so just just
keep that in mind
so for gaming I'm gonna recommend them
this they're more of a fun gaming
headset but the soundstage is definitely
there let's talk about their weakness
and that is rock and metal now I'm a big
lover of rock and metal it's my top
priority when I'm listening to music
Rock a metal take priority over
everything else that's just me you know
80s rock I love it you know recently I
was auditioning these with rock and they
just don't match rock in my opinion
they're not a rockers headphone
the sound signature isn't suited for
rock or metal that's just my opinion
some people may have a different opinion
but I just don't think these are a
raucous headphone so that's their
weakness I think that two weaknesses are
that they for long extended gaming
sessions they can get a little heavy on
the head I mean if you're a really big
guy you're probably not going to notice
but if you're elected was I guess an
average guy like me average size average
weight these will get a little bit heavy
on your head
also the second negative thing about
them is they're not that good for rock
and metal that's just my opinion but
definitely they're premium headphone
they sound phenomenal for pretty much
everything else you know people say that
the jack-of-all-trades and that's not
the case they're a premium headphone
with exceptional clarity exceptional
soundstage and their own unique sound
signature which I believe is suited for
electronic dance music above all else
you know I was listening to Eiffel 65 as
well too much of heaven and that sounded
phenomenal as well so I guess what pop
as well they sound pretty good I don't
know but they're yes I hope you enjoyed
the review of the Fidelio X ones and
I've certainly enjoyed listening to them
I'll be coming back to you guys with my
ghetto Heiser's or my ghetto hands
whichever name you think that deserves
to be called I will call them that and I
last thing I forgot forgot to mention
about these headphones too is they've
got a detachable 3.5 millimeter jack and
now essentially you can get a V motor
boom mic Pro like this so sorry this is
the left this is the right you can get a
V motive boom mic Pro and you can plug
it in and you have a gaming headset now
so that's what I really like about the V
mode of boom Pro is that you plug it
into pretty much any audiophile
headphone and make it a gaming headset
that has the detachable cable so it's
really cool and that's a nice solid Jack
you know I don't see that breaking
anytime soon also a negative and a
negative is also the ear pads aren't
replaceable but they do feel like
they're really they're made you know
really high-quality so I don't you know
I see these things lasting a long time
however if you kind of wear them out
over time
then maybe you might want to look at
getting some replacements somehow I mean
yeah that is a negative I guess and also
the cable some one thing I forgot to
mention about these headphones which is
crucial is they come with a really long
cable and even though it feels really
good like the call the quality of the
cable feels really that's braided it's
got a really nice look to it's got
Fidelio on it it just makes the
headphones sound like crap basically
they got I think they've got resistance
of 1 point 5 ohms or something and
honestly yet it made the music sound
terrible and then I changed the cable
just to a cheap Logitech auxiliary cable
and the music sounded really good so if
you're gonna get these headphones pretty
much just get the headphones get
yourself v mode of boom Pro if you're a
gamer or change the cable make sure you
change the cable and they'll sound that
basically open up and they'll sound
really good hey guys I hope you enjoyed
the review of the Dehlia x ones they get
highly recommended from me just know
that they do have two weaknesses that I
did mention if you're a gamer I mean
sorry if you're a rock head or you're a
gamer a hardcore gamer and that's about
it guys I've rambled on enough about the
Fidelio X once I will catch you guys
soon with another video peace out for
now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
