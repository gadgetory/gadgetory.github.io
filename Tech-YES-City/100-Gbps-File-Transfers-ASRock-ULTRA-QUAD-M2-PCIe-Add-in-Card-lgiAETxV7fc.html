that I've never seen before and that is
a key card that fits for MV ma m dot 2
slots and they combined together in a
raid 0 to give you some blistering fast
speeds I was seeing 10,000 megabytes per
second read and writes on both sides the
4k random reading rights were absolutely
insane - this is definitely going to be
the future when it comes to data
transfers and the release of a hundred
gigabit NICs as well so the speeds are
there of course fitting in for MDOT to
nvme Intel SSDs combines the raid 0 to
get the speeds that you need now this is
a card from asrock it currently costs
$100 and is out in the wild and it does
have a solid build quality - it's got a
brushed aluminium finish and if you pull
off the heatsink you'll see that there's
a little fan underneath and you can
actually switch on and off the different
nvme drives if you wish to
it will require a 16 X slot on your
motherboard and if you want the maximum
speeds it will also use up pcie 3.0 16
slot as well now the last thing - it
does need a 6 pin PCI power connector
since it is supporting four of these
drives also on display from Intel was
there obtained demos they had a 16
gigabyte module and also a 32 gigabyte
module on as rocks H 370 B 360 X 299 and
z3 70 motherboards you just take up one
of your m2 slots and you can add this in
to your drive and speed things up it's
great if you've got an old hard drive
for instance a 2 terabyte drive and
you're loading up a lot of the same
games while you're loading up the
browser every time you start Windows for
example this is promising to keep the
speeds faster however of course I do
have to see for myself and I can't see
that on the floor with just the
demonstration so stay tuned for a future
video where I test out the Intel
obtained and put it to its limits
you guys that's all for today's video if
you enjoyed this one - be sure to hit
that like button let me know in the
comment section below what you think of
the quad
he nvme add in cod I think it's
absolutely incredible the speeds are
definitely some of the fastest I've seen
out there on the market and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
