baronies coming back to you guys today
with a quick overclock a quick look at
4.4 gig overclock so what you're doing
this is the msi UEFI boss so what you're
doing if you're in the if you have the
msi boss you go to overclock and then
you just simply go to the adjust CPU
ratio here and you can set it to four
four four so forty four and that will
set it to 4.4 gigahertz and now fixed
mode is what you want to have this on
because that'll make all caused the same
speed every core will be running at 4.4
gigs and I'm going to look at more of
these settings the msi bios has so many
extra settings and I'm going to research
over the next month or two and then I'm
going to give you guys a full in-depth
overclocking guide on this motherboard
in this CPU but CPU core voltage all you
have to do is set that to one point one
four and the offset mode you can leave
that on auto and I think it uses in a
mode called adaptive mode so that's a
new feature on the Haswell z87
motherboards so after you've done that
so all what you have to do is really at
the moment at the basic just put this to
one point one four or you also be
similar might be one point one five
might be one point one six and put your
cause up to 44 as well and then all you
do after that is you save it so
overclocking profile this is my four
point four and click Save overclocking
profile and then just exit the box and
then it should overclock and you should
have these super safe overclock so this
in my opinion is like the super safe
this was like the madman 4.2 gig on the
Ivy Bridge this is super safe I think
anyone can get this overclock on has
well I think it's a really easy
overclock to obtain so we'll just put
this up and do a quick stress test show
you guys how hot it runs at this
particular frequency so let's get that
booted up okay so we just open i-264 you
just get the trial edition of ida 64
it's 30-day
it's actually a really good program I'm
really liking it because it does
everything it's an all-in-one so no
Skype I don't want to upgrade goddamn
sky okay anyway let's go start so just
hit that hit the start button you can go
cpuid here confirm that the overclock is
4.4 gigahertz and then it should be
stress testing all your cause you can
just go to sensor here and it'll give
you the temps so anyway guys if you have
any questions please leave a comment the
comment section below and please give
this video a like if you liked this
quick look at four point four gigs on as
well I 546 70k alright guys peace out
for now run easy bait</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
