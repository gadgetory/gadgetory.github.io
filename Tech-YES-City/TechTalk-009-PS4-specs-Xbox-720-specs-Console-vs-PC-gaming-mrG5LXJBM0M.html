yes city this is bryan easy and you're
probably already thinking what the hell
hey there's a new name coming and I
figured tech yes yes yes city yes all
things got a big yes from me I hope they
get a big yes from you and a thumbs up
if that's cool the day my guys let's go
tech talk episode name we're going to be
talking about consoles the console
industry the ps4 the xbox 720 I'm going
to be talking about is the console
industry dying is the pc industry dying
or it growing what not let's have a look
first off we've got the ps4 spec so i
pull these up for you guys it's rumored
to have an AMD we're pretty much certain
to have an AMD Jaguar eight core cpu
with 1.8 for teraflops of processing
power so basically my gtx 670 already
has almost double that i'm pretty sure
and yeah I mean people people are going
to say like or a PC is already huge it's
ready way better and that's that's okay
but quite remember this thing is
actually almost 10 times more powerful
than a ps3 so it's going to play games
and it's going to play games really well
because you don't remember consoles
they're dedicated to playing games
otherwise you know PCs are not dedicated
for playing games they have to go
through windows OS and different API is
like directx and so they are a little
bit inefficient when you compare them to
console so console gaming is still good
and its really good I enjoy playing
games on my we still so I think now
we're getting to the stage where
gameplay definitely starts to matter a
lot more than graphics and I'm 41 I love
in obviously a love game play on my pc
games which is why I play PC games
obviously I want the graphics there but
also want the gameplay and so you know
the graphics is not a negative thing
this is going to be a huge it's going to
be play games phenomenally well it's
going to be fine and it's going to be
obviously it's going to be priced I
think they should price it around four
hundred dollars I think 500 even 600 is
too expensive definitely 600 is getting
a bit expensive so this is rumored to at
least be launching at the end of 2013 in
one country so this is an article here I
honestly I don't know I probably think
maybe quarter one quarter to 2014 is
when we can see a ps4 do to sort of all
these delays getting delayed in the
x86 market since it is an x86 processor
and so yeah a reason I think you will
expect the ps4 before the xbox 720 and
I'll talk about that soon but let's have
a look at the xbox 720 this is the
rumors going around and there's a rumor
that's going to be called the xbox
infinity or the xbox loop and I don't
think so I mean they're not going to
call it if anything look at the wii u
okay look how bad that's doing they're
not going to name it a similar naming
system to the wii u they're either going
to call the microsoft infinity well
they're going to call the xbox 720
that's just my thinking if they call the
xbox infinity it's stupid stupid naming
system anyway the it's river to have a
dual GPU configuration as opposed to the
eight core sort of shared a pu and the
ps4 it's room to have two GPUs in it
that are going to work like some new
hybrid crossfire things so it looks very
interesting the xbox 720 obviously
hasn't got anything solid yet as opposed
to the ps4 which is kind of more sort of
solid and not as much rumor and so I'm
looking forward to seeing what the xbox
720 does and I think this is going to be
released after the ps4 and the reason
why is because of this I'll pull this up
for you guys here okay this is the this
was this is what happened the first time
around the xbox 360 came out before the
ps3 and so it created a big massive
debate on which one had better graphics
and since the ps3 was released a bit
later it had more maximum theoretical
gflops and to be honest my brother he
had both an xbox 360 and a ps3 and I
honestly from objectively looking at
them both on a 42 inch screen I thought
the ps3 looked a bit more a prettier so
that was just my thinking that's just me
as a guy who doesn't play much console
looking at it again so that's what I
thought the ps3 looked a bit better what
do you guys think did you think the xbox
looked better or the peace ps3 so I
don't know this time around Xbox would
have definitely taken that into
consideration merciful to take that in
consideration and they would have said
okay we're going to wait for ps4 to be
released now if anything this is another
thing I'm going to go into sales console
sales let's look at the total sales here
95 million on almost ninety six million
wees have been sold since in their
lifetime ok this is fifty percent more
than the
xbox 360 and the ps3 ok so both consoles
the wii is the biggest standout among
those three consoles ok there they
dominated they had a very unique thing
ok they had obviously they had their we
only titles saying with ps3 and same
with xboxes juices which I've gone to
later but they had such a new unique
thing and that was the whole movement
thing you know using your body having
different controllers I liked what they
did with the way it was fantastic I've
got a wii as well so I've got a week
downstairs I love the Zelda titles and I
love that I can play with my wife these
easy sort of easy to pick up learn
there's yeah the learning curve is like
easy as so I can pick it up straightaway
so there's pretty much no learning curve
there on the wii games and so yeah
that's what i like about the week and so
i think this time around you know sony
let's look at so we'll just go back to
sony's first this is another reason why
i think the xbox would be coming out
after is because sony have pressure ok
let's look at their balance sheet sony
is under immense pressure to get this X
this ps4 out because look their profits
are down four point six percent as a
company they have to start pulling out
things ok they have to start giving
things to the market because their
stocks are doing pretty bad okay let's
have a look at these numbers dr. equity
is okay they're not in any financial
trouble they're point zero five five
which is not I saw point five five to
one which is not too bad that's
reasonable but the basic chart if we
look at the stock price is over five
years you'll see that it's pretty bad
you know this stock has just gone from
you know what fifty dollars to fifth $14
it's over you know it has gone down over
the years so the market is sort of
saying hey Sony is not going with the
trends they're not doing well they're
getting competition from Samsung and
stuff like that so they're not doing as
well as they could have been doing and
that's because I just guess Samsung are
really cutting in on their business
especially with TVs and so yeah that's
only as a company they're basically in a
nutshell they're performing they're
going to perform well in the next few
years and they got pressure on them so
they have to get the ps4 out Microsoft
on the other hand if you look at them as
a company man twenty one percent profits
they are just cruising along they
no pressure obviously their you know
their server market they've got their
software it's just huge the xbox is
doing well they got xbox live they
charge for that you know they've got all
these subscriptions they got all these
licenses all this stuff they make good
profits okay there are no that debt to
equity is like point 19 which is very
low they're a healthy very healthy
company same with the stock prices over
the last five years you can check it out
I mean they've really the market sees
Microsoft as a pretty good choice i mean
a pretty healthy company that's how the
market that's our market sees Microsoft
so Microsoft are basically just sitting
back and going we're going to see what
ps4 does and then we're going to do the
same strategy that Sony did to us and
we're just going to make a better system
and so we can have those bragging rights
and definitely that's smart strata like
that I think Microsoft can do it they're
in a position to do that so that's what
we're going to expect from Microsoft but
anyway let's move on to the next debate
and that is whether so you know you saw
the we had the most yet even though this
is the thing that we had the least
amount of sales so I pulled this article
next to this one even though the we had
the least I mean so at the most amount
of sales it was the least sort of
graphic or it had the least amount of
grunt it meaning that the graphics was
the poorest of the three consoles and
this just goes to show that gameplay and
sort of features are a lot more
important than just raw power and you
know I like the fact that we did that
and they got the most sales it proves
that you know a lot of casual gamers
want gameplay and so that we offered
that and i think this so where am i
going to get back on topic it okay
basically we had a lot of casual gamers
pick it up because it was unique it had
good gameplay had fun games now this is
going to get obviously a lot of
competition now from tablets okay so
when you talk about the console industry
as a whole dying I think it's safe to
say that we in Pacific specifically the
wii is in the most danger because tablet
sales are just going crazy I have a
tablet you know everyone I know pretty
much has a tablet or wants to buy one
tablets you know casual gamers are going
to be saying hey I don't need to wear
you I've got my
why do i need this controller with a
touchscreen I've already got a tablet
with a touchscreen so i think the wii u
is specifically and we as vulnerable to
tablet sales because they're built
around casual gamers more so than
enthusiasts and so this when you see the
tablets I see we're getting hit the
hardest okay and so basically this is
going to be obviously it's affecting all
console markets i think the ps3 and the
xbox will be affected by the growth in
tablets but i don't think it will be a
hit as hard as the we will nintendo will
because nintendo have a massive amount
of casual gamers that don't really play
online as opposed to the ps3 and the
xbox so I see these tablet sales
obviously branching into all the
consoles and and you know competing with
them especially with a lot of
independent games or indie games so
they're going to be competing with the
Xbox all these so they're going to be
taking that casual market share which is
a massive amount okay the casual gamer
makes up a majority of the people who
buy games and consoles in my opinion
this is probably going to lead you to
ask why is the wii u doing so bad so if
you guys didn't know it's actually doing
pretty bad compared to the original way
which sold three hundred and forty-eight
thousand units in the same time period
where the wii u only sold 46,000 so that
is HUGE layers a big difference okay
that wii u is pretty much I mean it's
pretty bad okay the wii u and the reason
why you know people probably wondering
why it is the way you doing so bad and i
think it has to do with obviously a big
and i'm going to talk about this a
little bit more later but it's to do
with two things we you who the hell
calls their company our wii u so we're
going to go into the analogy now yeah
you don't call something a wii u you
call it the nintendo you or the nintendo
multi they should have called it
something unique god damn we to even
would have been better than wii u wii u
is just hopeless I mean this is going to
be this week's analogy this is the
Nintendo boardroom hey guys are you know
no pressure we did so well you know that
we did really well why should we call
our next gen console
and let's call it the wii u okay so
let's go home it's gonna be the wii u
easy ok no problems so that's what they
probably did is probably a five-minute
meaning what should we call the next-gen
console the Wii U okay you have no
problems absolute stupidity they should
have called it the Nintendo again I
thought the Nintendo multi or something
something original and something that
stresses and goes with trends okay and
this is another thing when I my friend
brought his wii u over it was so much
fun okay it's really fun to play at land
okay with four or five friends it's
really unique thing it's got a lot going
for it but i think the implementation is
a bad thing in that they you know look
at the trends okay league of legends
world of warcraft black ops 2 all these
games starcraft 2 all these games are so
popular because they have lobbies like
lobby games where you can just join
quickly pick up multiplayer matchmaking
systems and you can play against other
people it pretty much instantaneous on
the way you can't really do that it's
stupid at the moment they've got this
stupid area where you run around and you
gotta you see all these other people in
like a little city and it's just really
it's sort of designed upon japanese sort
of social networks it's not actually
designed for gamers and that's where
they flopped instead if they made like a
lot of lobby games like where you just
jump in matchmake they would do a lot
better and i think this is where the
xbox 720 and the ps4 really have to
focus they have to make a lot of lobby
games i don't know i'm just going to
call lobby games where you can just join
matchmake play people competitively
that's where they have to i'm not even
not competitively we just play people at
the same skill level as you and i think
that is a very important fact or they
have to do that this is the trend okay
people I for one want to play other
people my skill level and I want to play
competitively on PC that's why i love pc
and the black ops 2 currently caters for
that heroes newest really does that you
job with that those two games starcraft
2 as well there's three games completely
you know i get competitive i love it as
fun so i think they need to do that they
need to catch on the trends and a lot of
people like that so we use stuffed up in
their name and the fact that they're not
really focusing on lobbying games
another thing that have to do to so you
know this leads onto is console gaming
you know dying and
I don't like I agree with this article
it's not dying okay you know it's in
decline because obviously game you know
games are being price of fifty or sixty
dollars when there's free to play games
out there on the pc i think they're
losing market share but they're never
going to die like as long as there's a
TV in the household a console gaming
will or console unit will always be a
viable option so in all honesty yeah
this is a big article it goes on a lot
of points here and they say you know
like basically you know it's not going
to die they've in a nutshell so yeah
rise of cheap social gamers talking
before you know fifty sixty dollar games
yes i'm going to die it don't worry
about that but they really have to focus
on you know making cheaper games making
free-to-play games even that's what
these guys go on about and so you may
watch to read this but yeah console
gaming is definitely in decline that is
obvious and they have to obviously
another thing i'm going to bring onto
they have to make really good tight
alone like console only game so that we
did that was elders elders like my
favorite RPG of all time they needed to
bring back secret of mana which I just
love that game I don't know if you guys
know that but on the Super Nintendo
there was a game called secret of mana
it was just so much fun I was always
like where the hell is secret amount of
two coming out they should have bring it
out there should have brung out a wii
version or wii u version and it's an
epic game as an epic RPG but let's move
on to the next part of the talk so you
know xbox 360 only games you've got halo
a eric title i love that play that my
brother's xbox is a lot of fun they even
though I'm not too good at controller
FPS it's like for me it's just like damn
I want to use a mouse I can't damn this
controller yeah yeah that's what I think
when i use it about playstation 3
obviously you got gran turismo freaking
epic Racing Car Title I remember gran
turismo 1d if you guys ever played that
it was just amazing i loved gran turismo
the original and it was like one of the
best games of like its time especially
for racing car games so yeah they need
title only games and they need to really
focus that as well i'd love to play a
good our beach RPG or a good like gran
turismo which had like a kind of RPG
racer
was really cool so they need to do
unique things and make really good
console only titles and this things onto
the pc gaming verse console gaming now
so this is a big debate here you know
this guy says console gaming Joel
Gregory says that you know it's cheap
affordable it's reasonable as simple and
that's true this is why console game is
not going to die it's so simple a pc
gaming on the other hand is a bit
complicated you have to build your own
pc generally if you want to get good
frames or you have to buy an expensive
computer if it's a premade and that's
true so that it's going to be sheep it's
simple it's easier it's always going to
cater for people especially for mums who
want to buy that kids something easy
done console games you know and
especially for people who don't know
anything about computers there's gonna
be like look I want to play video games
on a Sunday with my friends or online
I'm going to get a console that's always
going to be market for that okay and I
think pc gaming now you know this guy
argues that it's more competitive and
they're two different markets honestly
and I think pc gaming honestly is more
competitive and this is my opinion and
PC gaming will continue to grow and why
will it continue to grow because of
eSports okay back in back 12 years ago
like I said in one of my other videos
eSports was so small now eSports is huge
okay it's AIT's absolutely massive it's
going to keep growing it's PC gaming
dominant you know dominant dominantly pc
gaming and it's going to keep growing
because of eSports and it's because it's
going you know I think the most
competitive games are played on the pc
that is my opinion and you know i think
it's going to keep supporting that so pc
gaming is going to be in on the increase
in my opinion plus the fact that i love
my pc i can build my own pc and its
unique to me it's kind of like a like a
you know modified sports car i like the
fact that i can do that obviously with
the xbox and the ps3 you can modify it
yourself and do what you want but not as
much as a pc so anyway let's have a look
now guys so PC game sales up two hundred
thirty percent console game sales down
twenty-eight percent this just shows
that pc gaming is on the increase and
console gaming is on the decline however
it's only you know this is because of
the economy I believe yeah I think once
the ps4 comes out and
the xbox 720 come out console game is
going to be revived it's going to get a
big boost so yeah but definitely one
thing to note is that pc gaming is going
to increase its going to continue to
increase because of the competitive
scene i think anyway this is another
look pc gaming is huge 2.8 million
copies of pc only games were sold like
world of warcraft and blizzard and i'm
going to actually address blizzard i'm
going to say blizzard are one single
handedly the reason for pc gaming and
why it grew so much this is my thinking
if it wasn't for blizzard I don't think
pc gaming would be anywhere near as big
as it is today they've just they make
these killer games starcraft brood wars
especially was a massive competitive
online game and you know they made a lot
of other games World of Warcraft they
may just these killer titles and it's
one of the reasons why I gravitated
towards pc gaming and so Blizzard are
you know awesome so I really love
blizzard obviously they got some huge
sales and it shows you how big the pc
gaming community is obviously 6.5
million one day sales of modern warfare
3 is a massive number as well but that's
spread across xbox 360 pc and the ps4
ps3 xbox p.m. so it's script spread
across three platforms so it goes to
show that they're all pretty equal i
think at the moment but if they go by 40
million steam accounts that'll give you
an idea of how many pc players there are
so obviously the markets pretty much as
big as the ps3 or the xbox so that's
something to think about now lastly i'm
going to talk about the GPUs and they're
basically in a nutshell there was a
hundred million GPUs sold in 2012
discrete GPUs not AP use and not I GPUs
discrete GPUs now obviously a lot of
these are going to go to companies and
whatnot but in a nutshell it goes to
show that you know discrete GPU sales
are there people are buying PCs and
people would bind discrete GPUs and
there's a lot of sales there as opposed
to the client in console sales which was
pretty mean you know was wasn't
impressive so we saw some pretty you
know what yeah c- main console down for
three percent down timpson down 18.5
then it's just yeah that was 2,000
pounds of us 2012 so you can see that
it's yeah the console market was in
decline anyway guys basically in a
nutshell yeah pc gaming i can i can see
it is going to continue to go up
obviously the steam box is rumored to
come out the video remember to bring out
a console I think they're pretty far
away so I'm not going to talk about them
today too many rumors going on but
another reason would be yeah steam
obviously steam is awesome they you know
provide cheap games and they sell games
for like five to ten dollars that as
well as another reason why casual gamers
themselves are getting into pc gaming so
PC gaming in general I don't see it get
being affected by tablets so much as
it's a competitive scene I see consoles
being affected by tablets a lot more
than PC gaming and also see a lot of P
console enthusiasts going towards pc
gaming because you can connect a
controller to the pc so ultimately yet
console game is not going to die but it
is on decline I do think the ps4 is
going to be awesome and also the xbox
720 will they both will be phenomenal
okay they're both going to be good okay
I can't wait to see what they offer I'm
not even buy one if they're that good
but a wii u is on my to-buy list because
it offers something that my PC doesn't
offer and that's awesome epic land party
games so if you guys looking for played
land get a wii u so many guys in closing
I hope you enjoyed this lesson of sir
this not less in this episode of tech

hurry as you can see i'm still in my
work gear but i wanted to get you guys
