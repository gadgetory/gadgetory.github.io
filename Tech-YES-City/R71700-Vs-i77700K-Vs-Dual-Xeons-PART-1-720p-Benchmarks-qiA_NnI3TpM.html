to be doing a comparison between the r7
17 hundred which is AMD's eight core
sixteen threaded beats coming in at
three hundred and twenty nine US dollars
and we're going to be comparing that
against the seventy seven hundred K
which is Intel's offering that fork or
eight hundred CPU that does have higher
IPC and does overclock a little bit
higher than the r7 lineup and then I'm
going to be throwing in my old
workstation which is a sixteen core
thirty-two threaded Beast I call it a
junior cron and this is going to be the
ultimate showdown a three part series
where I'm going to be telling you guys
in my opinion which CPU is best for what
so with that said let the show begin
so the first title we've got up here is
doom on the Vulcan API at 720p low
settings with the GTX 1080i or
overclocked to the rim so this is going
to give you guys an example of how these
CPUs can perform at their max potential
and we've got here the 7700 K
overclocked to five gigahertz versus the
r7 1700 overclocked to four gigahertz
versus the jewels eons which are clocked
at 3 gigahertz and I will say that the
jewels eons are on the five-year-old
Sandy Bridge architecture so it's doing
an absolutely fine job of playing this
game and I will point out that all three
rigs during this benchmark incurred no
stuttering at all so this is really how
a PC title should be optimized for PC I
absolutely love playing this game
there's no hiccups whatsoever if you
have the right hardware and you can see
at all times the 7700 K and the r7 1700
I'm maintaining the frame cap in this
game of 200 FPS and I would say that the
slight advantage will go to the r7 1700
in this title as it does a better job of
maintaining the GPU at its maximum
clocks and with that you can see at
times that the frame time variance does
go as low as 3 milliseconds which makes
this title I believe a little bit of a
victory for the r7 17
hundred so the next title I've got up
here for you guys is ashes of the
singularity this is with the recent
patch update for the Rison r7 1700 and
you see that all those 16 threads are
being fully utilized and it is pretty
much competing neck-and-neck with the i7
1700 k having these CPUs perform around
similar levels even though this is 720p
low setting it is on the CPU focused
benchmark the one weird thing that was
going on here was that the jewels eons
were just simply not being utilized at
all after thread 16 and it was a bit
disappointing since this is meant to be
a title for DX 12 there's one of their
poster child titles so I will say with
that I prefer Vulcan much more than dx12
just looking at these two titles as
Vulcan did a much better job of
utilizing all those threads available to
the jewel Xeon and going forward I'd
like to see a lot more titles for with
the game developers in utilizing Vulcan
and one thing that we're going to see
out of these benchmarks today is that a
lot of the onus does fall on the game
developers rather than people pointing
the finger at Nvidia or Intel or even
AMD and saying hey guys your combination
of hardware isn't working properly in
these games as we saw with Vulcan when
we inference the statistics there we can
see that really does depend on the game
and how well that game is optimised if
you're going to incur things like
stuttering or just poor performance in
general though this title is a lengthy
benchmark so I will cut it short and we
will move on to the next benchmark which
it does provide a bit more insight to
how these CPUs perform so the next title
we've got up here is rise of the Tomb
Raider and this is a title where the i7
7700 K does score a victory over the r7
1700 and the jewels eons but with those
jewels eons in the mix we can see that
pretty much half the threads here are
completely dead so something's going on
here where the jewels eons not only had
half the threads dead but they're being
underutilized too and we can see with
the awesome 1700 that the threads are
again being underutilized and even on
the 7700 K those thread
being taxed anywhere near 100% there is
one point in this benchmark where the
threads go spike up to 100% but that
also happens on the r7 1700 as well so
this is one of those things that again
falls on the game developers to optimize
the games for the CPU end of things to
completely utilize all those threads
available and make sure that they're
being taxed at 100% for better FPS but
when we stop on that note we will say
that all the FPS figures on all three of
these rigs are completely playable at
all times it just points to the 7700 K
having that advantage in those titles
where the gains aren't optimized for
more than four or eight threads and now
this benchmark isn't that long so we are
closing in to the final results soon and
when we move into these final results we
consider the 7700 K does come quite a
bit ahead of both these CPUs scoring
about 30% extra frames in the r7 1700
and also just killing the jewels eons
but moving on into the next benchmark
here we have f1 2016 and it's kind of
similar to Tomb Raider in that again
half the threads are dead on the jewels
eons and they're not being fully
utilized and the same as going with the
r7 1700 that trend continues where a lot
of these threads are being utilized but
they're not being utilized near 100% and
even the i7 7700 K isn't being utilized
at a hundred percent during this
benchmark it's coming close at times but
it does enable the 7700 K to pull ahead
in this benchmark and it does in able it
to score a victory though this is a
title that does play extremely well on
all three Riggs
there was no stuttering it was smooth as
butter even on the jewel Zeon's which
again are five years old this is the
Sandy Bridge architecture it is a
five-year-old architecture and these
Seabees are only clock to three
gigahertz and I know a lot of you guys
out there are on a budget and you're
looking to put together a gaming rig and
you're wondering if these jewels eons
are still relevant and I'm going to say
that with the optimizations coming in
for these CPUs
the risin are seven 1700 is going to
benefit from it but also at the same
time a lot of this older hardware that
has a lot of cause a lot of threads like
the jewels eons are going to be also
gaining advantages as well so we still
have a lot of headroom on our jewels
eons that will be utilized over time and
they will be utilized quite well and
keep in mind that the jewels eons are
only running at 1866 ddr3 memory even
though there's a lot of that ddr3 memory
and even though it is in a belief 8
channel configuration versus dual
channel on both the 7700 K and also the
r7 1700 that we can see with the final
results of the 7700 K does score a
victory then the r7 1700 does be the
Jules Elms the next benchmark we're
going to look out here is Metro last
light this is again 720p low settings
and we can see that this is a game that
actually does seem to utilize all
threads even on the jewels eons so very
impressive for a game that is quite old
now
surprised to see that this game was
utilising all those threads on the
jewels eons even though the percentages
were quite low throughout this whole
benchmark and again all the three rigs
are giving you guys an amazing
experience you can probably see that
I've captured this at 60fps so what
you're seeing is actually what is coming
out of the mandra or at least what's
coming out at the capture card going
straight into the recording so if you
guys see any hiccups then that is what
is coming out on my monitor providing
these storage or the capture card itself
didn't induce any stuttering while with
saving the mp4 file though I will say
the jewels eons here did perform quite a
bit lower than the r7 1700 and also the
i7 and the 7700 K did manage to score a
victory in this title though at times an
interesting observation here is that the
1700 there Rison r7 did manage to catch
up at times to the 7700 K so that was a
pretty interesting observation but again
CPU utilization here across the board
isn't anywhere near 100% and GPU
utilization is
anywhere near a hundred percent either
so again that game optimization does
come heavily into play here and how
these games are optimized and also the
driver of course since it is a dx11
title the driver optimisation is just as
important as the game optimization
though when we move into those dx12
titles and also the volcán titles that
is when the differences start to occur
the onus does fall on more of the game
developers to get the optimizations
right then the drivers themselves but
again guys really nice experience the
frame rates are extremely high on the
first two rigs though the secondary
bejeweled Veon does fall behind quite a
bit here in this benchmark which was
unfortunate to see though hopefully in
time more of those threads can be
utilized properly near a hundred percent
providing a better experience on these
jewels e on the e 526 70s this is on a
motherboard a workstation motherboard
even though it is pretty expensive for
the motherboard the CPUs were had for
very cheap I believe I got both those
jewels eons for around about a hundred
and twenty dollars for the pair of them
coming in much lower than the r7 1700
and also the 7700 K where those two CPUs
are priced over $300 though the
motherboards on the B 350 with the r7
1700 would probably be the cheapest
combination out of all three the next
title we have up here is Ghost Recon
wildlands which is optimized for 16
threads dare I say where we can see with
the jewels eons that half the threads
are completely dead though I will say
the performance of the jewels eons is
actually very respectable in this title
considering that it's only utilizing the
same amount of threads as the r7 1700 it
has ddr3 1866 and it's getting frame
rates that are pretty comparable even
though the 7700 K is scoring the victory
here the jewels eons aren't doing that
bad again for a 5-year old architecture
that's being severely underutilized I
would say that it did impress me a lot
in this title and of course all three
rigs played very well when it came to
CPUs performing in this title there was
no stud
no hiccups accepted modules eons when
those barrels were exploding I noticed
that that was when stuttering did come
into play and the 7700 K did handle that
the best so the next title we've got up
here is Tom Clancy's the division and
this is a title that really impressed me
for CPU utilization even on dx11 we can
say that the jewels are performing
extremely well on this title it is a bit
behind the r7 1700 and that is also a
bit behind the 7700 K but man all those
threads are being utilized and they are
being utilized quite well and it's
allowing this CPU or this combination of
Jules Elms to perform very well as we
can see with the GPU utilization it's
actually near levels of the r7 1700 and
also the 7700 K I was really surprised
to see how well these old-school
zealand's were performing in this title
of course not to detract away from the
r7 1700 that is providing a butter
smooth experience in this title and also
the 7700 K is just racing ahead scoring
that victory in this title though was
surprising to see it was unexpected that
a title like this could actually utilize
32 threads I never knew that this title
was as well optimized as it is and so
with this sort of with this new focus
that I'm going to be taking with the
benchmarks is we're going to start
seeing that a lot of the onus on
smoothness and on optimizations is going
to fall on the developers is they can't
make a title that's properly utilizing
all the threads or utilizing all the
hardware then we're going to see things
like stuttering and low frame rates and
poor performance and this title does
look very good graphically it's not a
graphically poor title does look very
good and it does perform really well
with the jewels they are doing extremely
well in this title
so this can
five one of the ultimate showdown in the
720p benchmarks are important to get a
grasp of how well these CPUs can perform
at their max potential and at least in
the games I tested I was very surprised
to see that three of the games were
actually utilizing all 32 threads on the
jillsy on making them pretty relevant
especially for an architecture that's 5
years old and only clocks up to 3
gigahertz
so that impressed me a lot and as you
can see with the r7 1700 all those
threads were being utilized in the
majority of titles so the r7 1700 coming
into the next few years is definitely
going to be a great gaming CPU however
these 7700 K is still on top pretty much
winning all the benchmarks shown here
today so stay tuned for part two where
I'll be doing the 4k benchmarks to see
how well all these rigs will perform at
higher resolutions and also on part
three we'll be doing those productivity
benchmarks so make sure you stay tuned
