so for almost a year now I've been
hearing such good things about a mouse
called the my onyx caster and when I
reached out and asked for a review
sample they were happy to oblige and
send me over one so today I'm going to
be going to an in-depth look into this
Mouse and seeing if it really is king of
the hill as soon as I got it in it was
packaged really well and upon taking the
mouse out it felt of really high quality
it had a rubberized psy grip there and
the plastic was really strong but also
having a soft rubberized feel for it
even if you had sweaty hands
you wouldn't slip using this mouse in
the dead heat of summer now moving
straight into the mouse's hardware
itself of features Armour on switches
and also a scroll wheel that in practice
felt in between smooth and also clicky I
honestly prefer a very strong clicky
scroll wheel this was sort of like
mediocre for me there moving into the
buttons those Omron switches are some of
the best you can get in the business no
doubt about that and moving on to the
sensor itself it features an a dns 3310
sensor there which provides great
performance out of the box and I will
keep a key note on out of the box when I
played with this mouse at 1080p the
performance was really good I didn't
have to change any of the settings I
didn't have to use any of the software
then when I took this mouse up to 4k I
noticed it started skipping and it
didn't matter which mouse pad I used it
found it that it just had a hard time
playing games at 4k I just couldn't get
this mouse to perform the way I wanted
it to and any Ceph software settings I
tweaked just didn't help the fact that
it just had this weird sense of skipping
at 4k I don't know what that was exactly
though for what it's worth 1080p gaming
was absolutely awesome on this mouse now
moving on into economics and this is
easily in my opinion the most important
part of a gaming mouse nowadays the
minus castaways in at 93 grams with that
weight distribution being more at the
rear of the mouse me personally I prefer
my weight distribution in the center of
the mouse hence why I use a razor type
int and the g3 is my daily driving
Mouse's depending on the computer I'm
using also with that said I didn't find
it a great thing that this mouse didn't
include adjustable weights especially
for a mouse that comes in at $70 I have
to critique that straight away though as
to the actual feel and the control of
this mouse I found myself not really
being a big fan of it I found it was
more of a Miss for me since it was
somewhere in-between a fingertip and a
palm gripping type Mouse I
couldn't get the hang of it even after a
few weeks of using it and I kept finding
myself just wanting to go back to that
fingertip grip type mouse where I've got
the Razer Taipan and also the Logitech
g3 especially for editing videos when
I've got a flick around a lot and do a
lot of things at once in games though I
found this mouse to be pretty good
especially for FPS games where you want
that sort of in-between feel between a
palm grip and a fingertip grip then this
will provide you with a nice feel though
keep in mind my hands are about 20
centimeters long from the middle finger
here to the bottom of my wrist so I
would have what would be considered
larger hands if that's any indication to
go by so I think that this mouse would
be more comfortable if you had smaller
or medium sized hands and you preferred
a palm grip type mouse now moving on
into the software and customization of
this mouse is actually a really good
thing the software is very easy to use
it's also very in-depth and detailed you
can download it on their website and it
also includes an application to update
the firmware now this software comes
with an analyzing tool which in practice
I found didn't work that well at all I
felt it just more or less tested the
actual gliding of the surface rather
than the actual accuracy as my Razer
Goliath is I know in the past it's a
very accurate Mouse mat however when I
compared that to a 3m mouse which glides
really well that scored much higher than
my raised agatha's mousepad the lift off
distance setting I found this disc
didn't make a difference in practice I
couldn't if I put it on the lowest
setting it didn't make a difference as
opposed to if I put it on the highest
setting so I was kind of confused a
little bit there - then moving on into
the DPI incrementation there this mouse
can go all the way up to 10,000 dpi with
50 different steps then you can also
program three different levels there
within one profile and you've also got
five profiles to choose from and on top
of that you can also configure the LED
lighting on this mouse - sixteen point
eight million different colors and you
can choose between different effects
they're like pulsating breathing and
just solid colors or no effect at all so
in conclusion what can I say about the -
caster well I think it hits a lot of
nails on the head but it also doesn't
hit a lot of my other nails on the head
I think for coming in at 70 dollars they
should have maybe gone less with the
boxing and also the RGB LED lighting and
put something like adjustable weights in
this mouse I think
really could have benefited from that
and also I found the software
adjustments even though they looked good
on the surface I found when I started
making all these changes they didn't
really make a difference for me and
actually they made performance worse
especially when I was gaming at 4k I
don't know what it is but this mouse at
4k I just could not use it and I really
got tired of it quickly no matter what I
did with the settings so there maybe
that's some feedback from my onyx it
they want to improve this in a further
in or future implementation of either
their firmware or a different model
though with the negative out of the way
let's move on now to the positive this
Mouse out of the box at 1080p gaming
performed extremely well I was loving
what this thing was doing especially was
playing some multiplayer games and
trying to get some fries at 1080p it was
a great experience
though again that shape is it for you
that would be something I would
recommend if you can try out the - if
friends got one or what not if you go
down the store and try one I'd recommend
to try it first before you buy because
the shape is my opinion is hit or miss
some people are gonna love it I just
didn't really like it since I'm a
predominant fingertip gripper with a
large hand so your mileage may vary
though I know a lot of other youtubers
like totally silence for instance and
joker productions they absolutely love
the - caster but for me it was kind of a
Miss and especially at 70 dollars I
thought - could have done a few things
better to make this the best Mouse out
there don't know guys that's about it
for me if you have any questions or
comments about - castles and be sure to
drop a comment in the comment section
below and I'll get back to you as soon
as I can and it will so if you like this
video please give it a big thumbs up and
I'll catch you in the next Tech video
very soon peace out for now bye
let's talk about my Spade B let's talk
about my onyx and me let's talk about
all the good things all the bad things
know the mediocre things over slightly
below average things oldest lightly
above every single the slightly negative
the slightly positive us by the
in-between over 25 all the Fabienne but
let's talk about mice sometimes a little
fish gets eaten by the big fish like in
the past I used to make my friends we
used to play Age of Empires and used to
click the mouse and use to see like who
could click it faster my do you ever do
that with your friends
that's real wonderful it's cowboy proof</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
