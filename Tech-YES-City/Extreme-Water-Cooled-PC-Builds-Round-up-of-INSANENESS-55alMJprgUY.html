three and I'm gonna take you guys
through a tour of some of the craziest
pcs at this event even this one behind
me now which is a standardized build
from ple they're putting in to RTX 2080
TI's intel i $9.99 hundred k old custom
water-cooled and the funny thing is it's
even got a smoke machine on it thousand
watt power splay 32 gigabytes of ddr4
memory all RGB bling throughout the
whole thing and that's that's gonna
definitely get you some high FPS when it
comes to gaming but also stay tuned
because in the description below there
will be a giveaway link for an 808 6k as
well so completely free to enter get in
with a chance but let's take a look now
at some of the other crazy rigs at PAX
oz 2018
welcome back to take your city and we
covered at the azuz booth all the azuz
stuff but we didn't cover this custom
rig right here custom loop water cooling
in a spiral metal chassis it is
extremely heavy but on top of that this
morning a i7 9700 k-8 core CPU it also
got an RT X xx atti inside now I did get
a thermal imaging camera out on this PC
overclocked to I believe four point
eight gigahertz on all cores playing
call of duty black ops 4 and the
temperatures all around the model were
really good so seems like everything's
doing a good job here the thing looks
incredible and it also performs really
well to boot to now a real funny thing
below here they got the Zeus Thor power
supply and that has a wattage readout of
the actual power being consumed by all
the other components in the build so you
can forget at least with this bounce
play gone are the days where you need a
power watt meter to read out your
wattage you just get this thing now to
read out all your components from the
power supply itself and it does honestly
look pretty good but of course a lot of
these components do come in at a premium
do keep that in mind here we are at the
razer booth and they're sporting some
costume pcs but this time with a little
bit of a twist aimed at the divas out
there more of a pink and blue scheme
going on there's also got a cat PC in
the background and I believe it's got an
80 700 K inside as well as the Vegas 64
graphics card custom water cooled as
well temperatures are low definitely
will play any game you throw at it and
the good thing is it's ready to go small
compact so you can count it with you
anywhere you want to go custom pcs I
believe tag mods did this one as well
and SR to Daffy jar jar is coming here
we are now at the HB booth and they have
two displays here for racing car Red
Bulls setups of Forza horizon for inside
these pcs RI 777 hundred KS and also two
gtx 1080s in sli having a go out these
things the performance is really smooth
you got two custom steering wheel and
pedals there and it's a really enjoyable
experience as well as the pc itself sort
of looking like the supercharger I think
they've definitely done a good job on
this
awesome racing sim setup so here we got
two more custom pcs at the Cougar booth
one being in the cougar essence I guess
a mini version of their previous
flagship custom-built case inside this
you've got a water loop going on with
the gtx 1070 and also a 8700 k looks
like it'll perform well and it does look
a lot smaller than the previous flagship
case kind of miniaturized does look
pretty cool moving over to the left here
we've got the panzer evo RGB so of
course as the name suggests RGB
everywhere you can even change it with a
controller maximum bling pre-installed
looking at a gtx 1070 TI zeus tricks
under a water block and then we've got
again an i7 8700 k with inside these
things and here we are returning to the
cooler master booth where before we
covered the hermit pods they were
awesome but they're actually being
powered by these two rigs here and we
saw these earlier at IEM in sydney where
they had such good hardware and looks to
boot but inside they've gotten an update
in terms of their CPUs and their GPUs
this time around for csgo that's the
whole thing we've got a terrorist and a
Counter Terrorist build looking at this
Counter Terrorist build first off we've
got an RT X 2080 from Oris these have
the three LED ring fans bigger coolers
and they will perform better than the
gigabyte counterparts are so I'm told
inside this one the Counter Terrorist
we've got a I 9 79 80
x 18 core CPU as well powering it so
there's going to be absolutely no tech
slowdowns whatsoever when it comes to
gaming or anything else moving over to
the left here the terrorists build we've
then got an i-9 9900 k and the same Oris
gravis card and we'll notice that the
blue LEDs on the Counter Terrorist seam
on the ring on the gross cards is then
changed over to orange to match the
theme of the build so essentially you've
got some upgrades they still look so
phenomenal the builds themselves and
it's so cool that one build is literally
the opposite of the other in terms of
how it's built to match the opposing
teams in this game two builds behind me
now from Ethernet tag mods these are a
different kettle of fish altogether and
that is that they're reflective the
first one being the csgo Howell build
based on of course the game csgo itself
inside you've got an I 999 hundred K and
also an art
20 atti and then a dark this thing just
lights up looks really cool really
innovative and then besides that there's
a faze clan build as well and this is
the same deal our reflective build and
it's got inside it an i7 808 6 K ready
to be overclocked because it's got water
cooling on it and then inside you've got
an oxy x28 ETI as well funny thing is
about these bills they're actually for
sale at the event so I believe they've
already been snapped up by two buyers
and very interesting because I thought
maybe the faze clan themselves would
definitely want this build since that
night it just lights up crazy and that
about wraps it up for the custom pcs
here at pax 2018 and right behind me is
Ethan's masterpiece the quake champions
build this thing is so big it looks so
wicked
I believe the developers themselves even
want this now off Ethan it's that
impressive always mind blown away and
Ethan if you guys didn't know he's gonna
be helping us through the SR to build
don't judge our very soon baby so don't
forget to hit that like button I love
each and every one of y'all hope you've
enjoyed the PAX 2018 coverage stay tuned
though we are doing a wrap-up of all the
really cool things sort of both tech and
non tech related and I look forward to
catching you the next one very soon he's
half an hour
over the best loafie the best is walking
the rave like check this got one more
for the setlist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
