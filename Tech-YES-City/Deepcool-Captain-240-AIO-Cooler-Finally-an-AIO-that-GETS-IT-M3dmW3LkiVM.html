deep cool
captain 240 like a boss ladies and
gentlemen welcome back to tech yes City
this is brian coming to you guys today
with a review of the deep cool captain
240 which is their flagship all-in-one
liquid CPU cooler now today I'll be
taking a look at what's in the box the
features of this unit then I'll be doing
a noise test for you guys and then
running some benchmarks for you guys and
then lastly giving you my subjective
opinion on whether I think this unit is
worth the money so soon as you open the
box it comes packaged very well you get
two fans included there they're 120
millimeters by 120 millimeters their PWM
controlled they also come with braided
cabling and you also get a fan hub in
there as well which will allow you to
extend one four pin CPU connector to an
extra four CPU fan connectors there
which is actually needed in this case
since you will need three CPU fan
headers to off the fans and one off the
block itself now also included is the
mounting kits and the installation
manual and the installation manual I
will say is very well written
installation was a breeze it was simple
and even a dummy could do it also on the
mounting kits it has support all the way
back to a m2 on the AMD side of things
and LGA 1366 on the intel side of things
looking at the main unit itself the
block and the pump deep cool this time
around have gone with a unique in-house
design so that's right they're not using
any ace tech pumps or coolers in this
unit which is a good thing in my opinion
and the union itself is a bit chunky
which measures at 56 by 56 millimeters
by 65 millimeters there and you've also
got a clear hose coming out the top of
the unit indicating that they're using a
custom red liquid solution in this unit
now printed on the side of the unit is
gamer Storm logo they're also on the
bottom of the unit they've got
pre-applied thermal paste on a copper
base plate and then coming out of the
unit there you've got two hoses one for
intake one for out take and they measure
up to 310 millimeters long and they're
also made of a ribbed plastic which I'm
not a big fan of though that goes all
the way up to the
radio which is a 240 millimeter radiator
in a black theme it's also got mounting
options there to mount it in either a
push or pull configuration or a push and
pull configuration if you have the extra
fans also the total dimensions of the
unit measures in at 273 millimeters by
120 millimeters by 28 millimeters thick
so now we'll do a noise test however
before we do that I'll quickly talk
about the pump which made no noise in
practice which is a great thing and upon
turning it on for the first time I
noticed that it had a decent amount of
strength to it as well you can hear it
flushing through that liquid and another
good thing is that this pump is rated at
120 thousand hours mean time before
failure which is a good thing
considering a lot of other El all-in-one
coolers out there are only rated at
50,000 hours now we'll just do a noise
test for you guys at the moment and I'm
sitting about an arm's length away from
my computer which is indicative in my
opinion of a real-world scenario so I'll
be quiet for a few seconds and then I'll
actually move up now with the microphone
and you guys can see the noise
so now let's take a quick look at the
benchmarks and we'll start with the 6600
case skylake rig that I have up here and
honestly when I tested this at 22
degrees ambient temperatures in a
controlled room environment this thing
only went up to 58 degrees after 10
minutes in I 264 full load and honestly
at these temperatures it made no noise
at all this thing was pretty whisper
quiet which is a great thing
and also you can see that it was beating
out the other air coolers there by a
comfortable margin as well so this unit
does perform really well especially on
the four cores so now we get onto my six
core 5820k benchmarks and this is where
things start to get into the realm of
serious business so four point three
gigahertz at one point to five volt you
can see here that the deep cool
captain 240 was beating the competition
by even more of a margin than it was on
the four core we have their 70 degrees
versus the next best competitor at 676
degrees however one thing to mention
though if you have a fan tuning profile
in your bias like my asrock you can
actually lower the speeds of your fans
to come in at a higher temperature and
this will mean that you'll be
sacrificing a few degrees in temperature
for much lower noise so in practice when
I did this man the fans were just quiet
or a lot quieter than they were on the
stock profile and I only dropped five
degrees which was still performing
better than all the air coolers I tested
so all in all I'm going to be giving
this unit four and a half stars out of
five I was very impressed with what deep
cool have done this time overall the
build quality is great the unit feels
solid and also they've clearly included
a strong pump in this unit now of course
I will be knocking off half a star for
those fans they do get a little bit
noisy and also the tubing as well I
wasn't a big fan of the ribbed plastic I
would prefer to see some rubber tubing
there which is a little bit more
flexible and durable in my opinion and
if they could I would love to see some
transparent black tubing to bring out
that red and make this unit overall an
absolute winner though let's look at the
good points strong performance you saw
the performance figures there in the
benchmarks this thing kicked ass I mean
it beat all the air coolers
have around here by a comfortable margin
as well as making low noise on the fork
or and even on the six core I could
sacrifice some temperature there to keep
the noise under control now this brings
me to that final important question of
is this unit worth it when I check the
price on the in it you could currently
get this unit for $100 I think on Newegg
it's got a $20 mail-in rebate at the
moment which makes this unit $80 and
honestly at this price it is fantastic
value for money and I can highly
recommend it for someone looking for
something to keep the four core under
control or even their 6 for under
control and do it while having a pretty
good looking solution and well so that's
about it for me guys if you have any
questions or comments about the deep
cool kappa 240 then drop a comment in
the comment section below and i'll get
back to you as soon as I can and if you
