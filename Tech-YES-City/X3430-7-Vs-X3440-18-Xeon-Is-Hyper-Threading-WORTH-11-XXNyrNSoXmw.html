three pcs one of them had a P 7 P 55 D
motherboard from a Zeus this is the LGA
1156 socket and it supports 2 Zeon's in
particular that are extremely good value
for money
one coming in at $7 this is the X 30 for
30 and the other coming in at current
market price of $18 that's the X 30 for
40 these are readily available on the
market you can buy them from Aliexpress
and they're overclockable even with
budget motherboards like H 55 which are
also readily available for like $50 and
so I was going back through the comments
and one of them said why don't I compare
the $18.00 CPU against the $7 CPU and I
thought to myself that's a very good
idea I wish I'd read this sooner and
that's exactly what we're gonna be doing
here today with a 780ti which I believe
are at least in my experience is one of
the best value for money used graphics
cards you can get on the market that
delivers exceptional performance so just
how big of a difference is there between
these two Zeon's let's find out
so first things first with these little
Zeon's we're actually gonna be deleting
both the X 30 for 30 and the X 34 40 and
the reason being is this was actually
the first generation or one of the first
generations where Intel was putting
thermal paste between the integrated
heat spreader and the die so yes they
were doing this long before ivy bridge
and it's even the same with the i7 860
who would that aside let's get on to
taking the lids off
you see what better safe than sorry
cuz you do scare to hit the ground my
sea dog but you know that I'm
so I just got a new vice and the first
deal it attempted it was successful I
mean the PCBs not harmed but the poor
IHS did get a bit of over cranked so now
it's bent unfortunately doesn't have ECC
on board
so now CPUs are all deleted and ready to
overclock I'm actually using a different
board this time around the UD 3p instead
of the P 7 P 55 D as that could only go
up to around 190 bays clock this however
should go a little bit higher I'm hoping
it will and then I'll enable us to get 4
gigahertz we're also using the hyper for
1 1 are cool master send this in as a
budget CPU cooler so I'm gonna see how
that performs with these 4 cores as well
so this at this cool master for one one
hour actually won't fit this motherboard
and that's mainly because the
motherboard has this permanently
attached backplate so we can't bring up
the screws in so it can attach otherwise
we have the replacement here anyway so
this is the vtg Aliexpress water core
this will actually fit so we're gonna
mount that now and use that for the
tests
so here we are now a conclusion time and
the motherboard and the CPUs how did
they overclock well the X 34 40 got 2 4
gigahertz at 200 base clock any higher
than that even bumping the IMC and even
bombing the CPU over generously that
still didn't allow to get to 4.1 or even
4.2 for example however the temperatures
were very controlled on both these
deleted CPUs max was like 59 degrees and
then over the X 30 for 30
that was like 58 degrees so the
temperatures were very controlled and
speaking of the X 30 for 30 managed to
get that to 4 gigahertz as well but keep
in mind the base clock was a little bit
higher it was two hundred and ten
megahertz on the motherboard and so this
will enable the qpi speeds for example
to be a little bit higher and so you'll
see in games this does score a little
bit of an advantage for the four core
four threaded CPU versus the more
expensive four core eight threaded CPU
now for the graphics card we're using
the GTX 780 Ti
this is clocked with an overclock of 116
megahertz on the core 326 megahertz on
the memory now I did set the fan speeds
to 100% just to weed out any variance as
well and pulling out the first benchmark
here Cinebench would just quickly get
this out the way with 612 CB on the x 34
40 multi-threaded test and 121 on the
single thread versus the x 34 30s 462
and 121 so scoring identical on single
thread moving over to the dota 2 average
FPS 188 vs. 192 0.1% low of 44 verses 36
1% low of 73 vs 76 so there's going
pretty much neck and neck in dota 2 and
there actually is a bit of variance in
this benchmark itself move over to the
which at 360 FPS cap on this game low
settings at 1080p we managed to score 60
average FPS on both these CPUs 43 versus
45 on the 1% lows and 16 versus 17 so
the point on descent loads this game
just has some inherent stuttering it's a
really bad game in my opinion to
benchmark I might drop it from the
benchmark catalog let me know what you
think in the comments section below
moving over to csgo however this is a
game with the X 30 for 30 scored a
victory 285 average FPS versus 270 and
the 0.1% loads and 1% lows were
virtually identical here so
this game I believe it's called the
victory for the fork or for threaded sea
for you the cheaper variant because of
that CPU and motherboard higher base
clock overclock of 210 versus 200 the
memory speeds on the ddr3 that was 1600
megahertz nine nine nine twenty eight
and it was a little bit higher on the x
thirty four thirty
due to that ten extra megahertz on the
base clock however movie out of Far Cry
five intensive game 78 average FPS on
the X 34 40 verses 79 on the X thirty
43068 versus 69 so basically the same X
thirty four thirty did just edged it out
slightly did test this multiple times as
well and since it is a pre can benchmark
you're gonna get the same benchmark
Apple staples every time and then movie
with a last game here we've got project
cars to did a couple of runs here on a
custom map 98 average FPS versus 96 78
versus 67 74 versus 48 so the X 34 40 in
this benchmark I believe scored the
victory especially with the point one
percent lows did run a little bit
smoother so that's maybe a benefit of it
using more cause more threads I did
notice in project cars - it was
utilizing those causes for calls for
threads on the X 30 for 30 near 100% -
so basically when you look at it there
wasn't a big difference between these
two GPUs ones like literally coming
close to seven bucks the others coming
close to eight bucks but one does have a
little bit more potential than the other
and that's the X 34 40 but if all you're
doing is coupling it with a graphics
card that gets a fire strike score under
10,000 points for example say a seventy
eight seventy or gtx 1050 or a tempeh
DTI even then something like the x 34 30
is still so relevant especially if
you're on a budget and those ten dollars
matter to you x 34 40 however does have
a bit more potential but the reason i
covered it with a 780ti here today is
because I believe it's like one of the
most higher-end grabs cards that you
would want a couple with the CPU this
cheap for instance I wouldn't recommend
anyone couple of GTX 1080 or GTX 1080i
with the likes of an $18 CPU I mean if
you're gonna spend $500 plus on a
graphics card please do yourself a favor
and spend a little bit more on your CPU
but in terms of the 612 Cinebench score
that's getting awfully close to
I 737 70 for example so you can see the
potential of these old zealand's
especially their price point and
especially given that you can pick up a
cheap age 55 or a cheap p55 motherboard
just shows you how good of a value for
money cpu these old things really are
and they can still get up and boogie now
as for the D lid I used the lid off on
i-35 30 that surprisingly was thermal
paste on one side and sold it on the
other don't really know what's going on
there but I pulled that apart and it was
really cool to see because I then am
using that lid now on the X 30 for 30
and it's working absolutely fine I do
recommend deleting these CPUs and you
will get a temperature drop of 10
degrees plus as in the previous video I
had a non deleted x 34 40 that was
scoring close to 70 degrees and that was
only at 3.8 Giga so if pumping more
voltage with pumping higher speeds and
we're not even getting over 60 degrees
so very good CPUs even to this date now
of course the question is still out
there what CPU would I pick out of the
XC 430 in the X 30 440 honestly it just
really depends on your budget I buy both
these CPUs and I buy a lot of them
because they're both really good value
for money I'd say as I said before if
you're going with a lower end gravis
card X 34 30 is gonna be absolutely fine
save yourself a few bucks but if you're
going with like a 780ti or even an ion
290x and you still want to save money x
34 40 or even the x 34 60 or x 3470 are
both really good choices anyway guys
hope you enjoyed this video if you did
then be sure to hit that like button let
me know in the comment section below if
you got any questions about either of
these little baby Zeon's I love them
both I love you guys and I'll catch an
another tech video very soon peace out
for now they
sixty-eight so here we are right here
with the rig the previous video that was
uh
