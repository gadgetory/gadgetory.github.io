coming back to you guys today with a
quick speed test on my internet in Japan
so I got asked what's your speed what's
playing at speeds like basically I am on
a 200 megabits per second download and
100 megabits per second upload
connection but basically there
realistically let's have a look at what
we get so today we just go I'm on big
globe my ISP that's basically in Japan
they have two sets of ISPs you basically
get the connection from flats which is
like the main provider or au and then
you get another company which gives you
the username and password so this is my
first time doing this or not this is
just everyday speeds kind of thing now
if I plug my cable directly into my
computer from my modem I the max speeds
I've got was about 94 I think in about
78 so this is through my route Rudo and
it's just on a cat 5e cable which is a
10 meter long cable so I think if I did
this with a cat 6 cable directly plugged
into my modem I'd probably get a little
bit faster so especially my speeds guys
the now the download limits guys there
I'm limited ok so if you kind of Japan
you get an internet connection here
they're generally unlimited and it costs
about me about cost me about gorson in a
month for a house if you're an apartment
it's a lot cheaper so in apartments
about sons and go how in a month which
is about 50 dollars or maybe $45 and
then a house is about $60 $65 month and
that gives you unlimited downloads now
the thing to remember though I have got
a warning message from them because in
one day I did download over 35 they
taught me how much I'd out in one day
I'd downloaded like 35 gig and uploaded
some more but they probably thought I
was a server and so you're not meant to
download that much I guess officially
you've got like a 2 1 terabyte cap a
month but you know I mean unofficially
sorry so yeah that's about it from you
know so I did get a warning message and
they said you look you know you're
downloading a lot please you know please
we go
you know please don't let this happen
again kind of think so huh
I mean yells downloading water water I
was like 20 gig downloading all my other
games so you know just one day whilst
this reinstalling my computer so
basically yeah you know there is sort of
I mean 30 Giga days massive so anyway
guys but that's like you know even then
if you did it and you kept doing it
continually you can just say I'm just a
power user and you can prove that you
know they just don't want you being a
server basically hey guys I'm gonna be
on a beer chat tonight with my friend
fireman crew me so if you guys are on
internet tonight just come and check it
out and it'll be a Google live hangout
so feel free to join in and if you
haven't check out my contest guys if
you've got any other requests or any
other comments or anything you want to
add just please leave them in the
comment section below yeah basically
guys this is a this is a this is a
standard Japanese internet connection
here Cody fiber so it's basically fiber
optics hey guys hope this has answered
your questions and peace out for now
