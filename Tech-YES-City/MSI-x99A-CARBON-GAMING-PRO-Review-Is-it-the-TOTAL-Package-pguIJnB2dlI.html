world MSI brought to the table and x99
board that well has full RGB LED
implementation with custom controls
though besides the RGB x' is the
motherboard any good let's find out what
would a tech city this is brian coming
to you guys today with a motherboard
review and this time we have the x99 a
gaming Pro carbon from MSI which is
their latest motherboard to hit the
streets especially in regards to the
release of the 6800 K they're getting on
straight into the important stuff how
well does it perform well I had my 6800
K at one point three five volt for 20
minutes and the MOSFET heatsink only
managed to hit 48 degrees in a 25 degree
ambient environment definitely
impressive as for the VRMs itself it
features Niko's PK 6 1 6 ba MOSFETs on
the low side which are rated at 50 amps
and then for the high side they have PK
632 pa MOSFETs which are rated at 88
amps chokes are rated for 60 amps and
also included this tank a rated solid
state dark caps right beside that is the
steel reinforced DIMM slots with four
phases dedicated juicing over 3.4
gigahertz overclocks and more the ddr4
memory for a total of 12 phases on the
VR m8 being dedicated to the CPU just
above that you have three fan headers
with one being a water pump header used
for powering double the standard with 24
watt available for pumps and a dr. debug
LED right beside that which doubles down
as a CPU temps for nomina whilst in
Windows Renault Meter a new metal moving
down the board there are two USB three
front port headers with one having
vertical and the other having horizontal
mounting configuration there is also a
USB 3.1 C in the middle the side of
three ports the carbon has six on the
right side of the board and a further
four more on the bottom of the board
giving users more options than normal
for cable management in between that is
also one u dot two port and one solder
Express power and reset buttons have
also been implemented on this board and
finally finally the return of the
missile launch button which has made its
way back to motherboards Ashley doesn't
launch any
sails but this button will allow you to
overclock the board very easily if they
are in the BIOS all you have to do is
turn the nozzle left or right to set the
automatic overclock and you should be
good to go
I found a practice it was a little bit
aggressive however you may want to be
careful especially if you set this knob
to either the 10 or 11 setting though I
found it did hit a 4.2 gigahertz
overclock with ease which was only a
hundred megahertz off my 4.3 gigahertz
overclock there is also a dual blast
with a switch located directly above
that to the left of the missile launch
button is your three cidery connections
one of those being solder expressed to
us beef pronounced front panel power
front audio and a fan header with an
interesting port right beside that the
RGB out which allows you to hook up RGB
LEDs to the motherboard and then control
the RGB strips from the motherboard in
Windows itself via the gaming app
something that works really well in
practice 2 moving up the board there is
the trusted platform module support
connector therefore PCIe 16 speed slots
with still Armour which have support for
up to 3 Way SLI and to one speed slots
embedded in between and in the center of
all that is an m dot 2 slot supporting
three different sizes of configuration
moving over to the back of the board
there is a ps2 slot 5 USB 3.1 headers 1
USB 3.1 C and 4 USB to ports and wafer
it a clear CMOS button yeah for the N
ICMS I have gone with the Intel 2 1 8 V
which also includes the MSI networking
app allowing you to still play games on
a congested Network kind of like the
killer yet better since it features the
Intel n IC the sound there's the realtek
1150 with 5 analog jacks and 1 optical
out there is also a dual headphone
amplifiers and when testing the audio
with my V motors it was crystal clear
with really low levels of crosstalk and
also plenty of extra volume to go if you
wanted to send yourself deaf the mic in
port itself is also pretty good and
features noise suppression though let's
give this a quick test in raw mode so
here's what the x99 a gaming Pro carbon
motherboard will sound like with a V
motive boom for a plug directly into
that mic in port this is on a D 10 DB
boost with 50 volume so this is what it
like raw but let's get back to the
review so the x99 a carbon hits just
about everything I would want from the
motherboard and then some the software
unlike most other motherboards is
actually really useful the gaming app
allows you to control your RGB colors on
not only the motherboard and individual
parts of it but other devices like for
instance external RGB or even your
graphics card if it is an msi variant
also included is a six-month xsplit
license gaming hot key app and a two
month license of what the fast which can
apparently help with some competitive
online gameplay there is also the msi
ramdisk app and another interesting
piece of software called the dragon i
app allowing you to watch your favorite
streamers while USA waiting for a game
queue to pop also surprisingly the
carbon is actually a 2036 pin socket
with msi providing an additional 25 pins
which they say helps with overclocking
and since they have been taking
overclocking records as of late and my
6800 K had no problems hitting 4.3
gigahertz at 1.3 5 volt I'll take their
word for it though lastly let's talk
about the UEFI BIOS two modes simple in
advance going straight into advanced I
saw there were plenty of options there
for overclocking and with the ability to
change your fan speeds manually and also
save your overclocking profiles there
was nothing that I could fold about this
boss so there we have it everything I
could want from a motherboard personally
I was happy to report that the PCB size
was also juicy thick and everything in
general worked extremely well with the
layout of the port's also being a very
nice touch to giving modest extra
options though if I had to fall one
thing about this motherboard it'd be
that I'd like to see an additional ni C
included to give a total of 2 though
everything else on this board just blew
me away the RGB is and the
implementation of those in the heatsinks
looked really nice the software worked
really well the audio was good both on
the input and output and overclocking
was solid ultimately though it is a
board that I can highly recommend coming
in at 499 a 2d or 329 USD it does carry
a premium however keep in mind it is a
premium product anyways if you liked
this review then be sure to overclock
that like button and let me know in the
comments below have you got a
motherboard with RGB on it at the moment
if so what mother
or do you want our jeebies momentum on
your motherboard
we'd love to hear your comments as usual
and if you have any questions about the
msi x99s carbon then be sure to drop a
cone in the comment section below - and
I'll get back to you as soon as I can
so if you didn't know already I'm slowly
becoming an RGB fanboy I know right
anyway guys I'll catch you in the next
Tech video very soon he's out for now
bye
there's also also power consumption was
pretty good on this motherboard when I
was testing it from the wall we had
about 70 to 80 watts on idle and also at
4.3 gigahertz in i-264 the the wattage
was about 180 watts from the wall
so a pretty good motherboard in general
for power consumption especially given
the power that it gives out and that's
about it for now guys if you liked this
video them</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
