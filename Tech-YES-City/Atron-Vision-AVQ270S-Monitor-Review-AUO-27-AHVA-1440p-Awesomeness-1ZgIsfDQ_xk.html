the avq to 70s from a company called a
Tron vision ladies and gentlemen welcome
back to tech ES city this is Brad coming
to you guys today with a 1440p 27-inch
monitor review now this is a company in
America called a Tron vision and they're
supplying essentially Korean panels with
local warranty and some extra features
added on and I'm gonna talk about what
these features are and in the end of the
video I will give my subjective opinion
and conclusion on this monitor however
before that we'll talk about the
features and what you get in the box
with this monitor so as soon as you open
this out of the box you'll notice that
it comes packaged extremely well they've
packaged foam around all sides of the
monitor so it doesn't get damaged in
shipping which is really important on
monitors I do take note of that you also
get the power charger included there and
a 1.5 minute dual link DVI cable also
included is a plastic stand which is
pretty sturdy and will allow a tilt
adjustment there though it will not
allow swivel or height adjustment and
the natural height off the desk measured
in at about 17 millimeters over looking
on the back you'll notice that it is
vests are compatible there so you having
to mount these to a variety of stands
whether it be on the wall or on your
desk which I do highly recommend with
these monitors because 70 millimeters is
not sufficient on most deaths in my
opinion now while we're on the back of
the monitor will quickly look at the
coating there it's like a matte
reptilian skin finish and I'm actually a
big fan of this because it doesn't
fingerprint at all and it actually looks
pretty sleek looking at the connectors
there with this model you also get the
ability to connect HDMI audio in there
you've also got dual DVI support VGA
support and a DisplayPort there as well
so a lot of options there for
connectivity also the top that you've
got vent holes to allow heat to
dissipate from the monitor and also at
the bottom there on the right and bottom
left sides you have the speaker holes
there which are five Watts on each
speaker now coming on to the front of
the monitor there you've got a 25
millimeter thick bezel there surrounding
the whole monitor and then on the bottom
there you've got the a Tron vision logo
with a little bit of an extra bezel
there which is a brushed plastic now
looking at the bottom of the monitor
you've got seven different buttons there
which will aid in navigation
the OSD and turn the monitor on and off
and they all have great feedback to them
going into the ISD however will reveal
different options there with the ability
to change the brightness and contrast
with the max brightness being 100 and I
found that this was good for everyday
use so I would like to see a bit more
brightness coming out of this monitor
even though it was a supposedly rated at
300 ccd now looking at the contrast
there I like to leave that on 50 and
then going down to the colors it
actually comes pretty close to perfectly
calibrated out of the box which is a
great thing about a lot of these IPS
panels so you don't really don't have to
play with the colors there though you do
have the option there to change the low
blue light filter on one two or three
and I found at the max 3 setting it did
cut down the blue line by quite a bit so
people will be happy to know if they
need to change this on the fly without
using flux then they can use this low
light built low blue life filter with
ease however the OSD in general was a
little bit cumbersome and I found myself
having it a little bit of a tough time
navigating through all the different
features especially if I wanted to do
things quickly though that being said
there's also the option there to have a
heads-up display
regardless of what game you're playing
so I think no scope snipers will love
this option you can change between three
different styles either red or yellow
and you can also change different modes
on the monitor with the game mode giving
you more gamma and more contrast in
general looking at the panel itself this
is where all the magic happens here we
have a 27-inch 1440p panel which is 2
560 by 1440 pixels and also on that note
is from a you optronics which make the a
hva panel which differs slightly from
the aah IPS from LG and the benefits of
this is that it is a little bit more
responsive i specially found this in the
tests that i did and also in games as
well now the colors are all pretty
similar as well though I will give the
edge to the aah IPS panel though on that
note both these panels have much better
colors than 10 in contrast
further on that note though the viewing
angles I found were not that good in
practice I found that the viewing angles
on my H IPS panels were far superior
than both this panel and the tan panel I
had downstairs now looking at the
backlight bleed there when you pull up a
black image there we've got a little bit
of backlight bleed coming out in the
bottom center of the monitor there which
did not affect anything in practice I
didn't notice it in real-world
conditions
and it was interesting that if I did
press it down I could massage it out a
little bit so I will work on getting rid
of it completely they're looking at my
aah IPS panel that has virtually none
looking the white uniformity levels
there they are pretty good however you
might notice from the photo that there's
a little bit of shift going on there but
nothing that's gonna stop you or
distract you in everyday gaming or work
looking at input lag and overclocking
the input lag inherent to this panel is
I'd have to guesstimate about 20
milliseconds it was about 10
milliseconds slower than the aah IPS
panels that I have here with no input
scalars built-in so if I had to
guesstimate it would be around about 20
milliseconds you can see from the test
here it was performing about 10
milliseconds behind the aah IPS panels
so whether that is due to the input
scalar or not I don't know as I don't
have another panel without an input
scale of built-in on this particular
model however onto overclocking I found
that this model could lock in overclock
though it wasn't stable it was actually
frame skipping at anything above 60
Hertz which essentially means that the
over locks are going to be useless to
the average person I noticed that on my
other korean panel here it could
overclock to 66 hertz no problems which
means it wasn't a software-based problem
it was more of a hardware based problem
in that this has the input scaler built
in also some little things that I didn't
touch on you have hdmi 1.4 v there which
will allow 2 v CC by 1440 at 60 Hertz to
be displayed on this panel absolutely
fine
you've also got the option there for
virtual 4k which awesome Utley comes
from the graphics card though it is
printed on the box there so I feel like
mentioning it and it will give you a 4k
experience if you're used to using 4k
monitors and for instance you need to
edit videos or whatnot
or if you just have an overpowering
graphics card and you want to get a
slightly better picture on your display
lastly before we move on to a conclusion
I will quickly touch on the coding of
the monitor itself it is a matte finish
or I'd like to call it a light matte
finish because it did a great job of
blocking out reflections but also giving
out a really good picture and that it
didn't spoil the colors too much so
great job on the coding there so now its
conclusion time and I'm gonna tell you
about my subjective opinion on the AV q2
70s and whether I would recommend it to
buy or not now in the past week of using
this panel I'm very impressed with it as
you guys know I'm a big fan of the
Korean 1440p panels and this is
essentially what this is based off if
you guys know
Kunik Stu 710 that is a fantastic panel
for the money and some of those models
can be overclocked and that's the models
without the scales though this one has a
scale of built-in which allows for more
inputs more pacifically you get the
option there of display port HDMI and
VGA as well so and that's a good thing
in that you have more inputs though it
does introduce a little bit more input
lag and another good thing about that
though is is that the DVI port were to
go in years time you've got other inputs
that you can use and still get the most
out of your panel now back onto the
panel itself you do have that gorgeous
1440p panel which has better colors a
lot better than 10 though it's just not
as good as the IH IPS by a little bit
though it does have better response
times in the a h IPS so in my opinion
it's a perfect balance for the gamer
looking for a great experience but also
looking to still be competitive announce
rating time this is where I'm gonna just
give it an overall general rating I'm
gonna give it 4 out of 5 stars
I think the extra features are really
good like the low blue light filter the
heads-up display especially that
heads-up display being aimed at gamers I
thought that this is where I was
detracting a star away because you are
putting the scaler on this model which
does give a little bit more input lag
than normal as well as the fact that
this model doesn't overclock well does
overclocked or does skip frames anything
over the standard 60 Hertz base there so
that's where I'm gonna be knocking off a
staff for those two points I think the
extra money that you pay over the Q
Knicks is well justified if you want
something that's going to ship locally
and also have that warranty and peace of
mind so great solution here from a Tron
vision ultimately and for $320 it is a
good buy if you're looking for a sweet
spot monitor they can pretty much do it
all so anyway guys if you have any
questions or comments about this model
