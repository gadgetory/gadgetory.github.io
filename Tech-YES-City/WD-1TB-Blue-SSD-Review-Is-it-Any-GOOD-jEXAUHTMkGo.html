extremely durable hard drives but now
they are branching into the SSD market
and one has to wonder are they any good
let's find out
welcome back to taxi to this brand
before we get on with this review I'd
like to give a big thank you for WD for
sending out this SSD for review and with
that being said I'm coming to you guys
today with a review of the new line of
blue SSDs which come in both 2.5 inch
and MB l2 flavors over site or three in
three different varieties of 250g but
primarily you but and a thousand
gigabyte models there's also a green
line up to the today I'll be reviewing
the one terabyte blue model which comes
in and around about 255 USD on Amazon
for about 435 Australian dollars from
the computer Alliance in Australia that
was about the cheapest I could find it
in Oz for so at this price point what do
you get well looking inside the drive
you get 8 128 gigabytes and is 50
nanometre TLC flash banks which has all
the data then there are two 512 megabyte
micron ddr3 burst banks connected to the
88's s107 for Marvel controller or as I
call it the marvelous controller
included is also a three year warranty
and a 400 terabyte endurance and 1.75
million hours mean time before failure
rating on this particular model also
every drive goes through WTF IT
functional lab to ensure that will work
with a broad number of desktop and
laptop computers however there is no
hardware level encryption and advertised
read and write speeds are 545 megabytes
per second read and 525 megabytes per
second right in the real world the
figures were very close to the
advertised speeds and it was great to
see how consistent the reading rights
were when I tested this drive in HD tune
Pro comparing it to another SSD I have
here the speeds and especially the
consistency were much better and also
the Marvel controller was doing its job
as always without having any major dips
which means that this drive would serve
you great as a temporary high bitrate
live recordings drive though doing some
real-world tests with this driver could
see that it was a tad bit faster than
the a pace of one terabyte SSD I have
here on a broad boot test and also when
it came to booting up a game this SSD
did edge out the other 1 terabyte
by a little bit as well it is also
note that is much faster than a standard
hard disk drive which is to be expected
though keep in mind it isn't an nvme
PCIe drive and it also of course comes
in much cheaper than one if you want to
see how a hard disk drive compares to an
SSD versus a PCIe nvme drive then I'll
put a link in the description below for
you guys now continue on with this
review there are other tools included in
the package for instance you can
download W DS SSD dashboard which
monitors things like the temperature the
drive health and will let you know if
anything is wrong
WD will also be hosting a giveaway for
Australians via their Facebook page
which I'll put the link in the
description below for so stay on the
lookout for that so all in all very
solid drive for the money one that has
consistent read and writes and also
boasts good endurance figures not to
mention that Marvel controller onboard
lastly another cool feature I found is
drivers it is compatible with OEM
version of acronyms client software so
you don't need to go out and pay
anything to use this software if you get
this SSD anyway guys that's about it for
me today for you like this video to be
sure to hit that like button and let me
know in the comment section below what
do you think about WD branching into the
SSD market would love to hear your
thoughts and opinions on that and also
if you have any questions about the
drive that I reviewed here today then be
sure to drop a comment in the comment
section below and I will catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
