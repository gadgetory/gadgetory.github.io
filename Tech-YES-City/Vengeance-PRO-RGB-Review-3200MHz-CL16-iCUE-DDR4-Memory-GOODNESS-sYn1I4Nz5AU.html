the person wanted to buy a PC more
pacifically they wanted to buy a PC with
RGB lighting if it didn't have RGB they
weren't gonna buy it so of course I have
fulfilled the request and salt the PC
though it had simple ddr3 memory in it
and now here's the thing at that time
I'm pretty sure that person did not know
that ddr4 Corsair Vengeance per memory
existed had they had no one I don't
think I would have got that sale because
this is why
welcome back to check your city and I
got sent over a review kit of 16
gigabytes of vengeance per a GB memory
this is to buy a gigabyte sticks and the
good news is straight away this has
thirty-two hundred megahertz XMP
profiles with CL 16-time is at one point
three five volt and why that's a good
thing is because this means that it has
Samsung BG memory great for overclocking
and also great for AMD rise and platform
users so I was able to get this stuff up
to thirty six hundred megahertz on a be
350 motherboard and also I was able to
get it up to thirty six hundred
megahertz where CL nineteen timings as
well on an Intel motherboards
so there was no difference in terms of
imax overclocks on different platforms
and the IQ software works tremendously
well you can change the lighting effects
on this RGB memory to match your build
there's a lot of different effects that
you can go through and also you can
change the speed and even link it to
your other individual items in the whole
profile however one thing I will state
is that I tried an x4 70 motherboard and
also a be 350 motherboard and the IQ
software still needs to be updated to
support those platforms as it did work
flawlessly on the z3 70 and the 8th gen
8700 K that's if you want to extract the
lighting effects and you want to match
it all up and make it work properly at
the moment I'm sure they will update
that in the future but we're looking at
pricing here it's two hundred nine US
dollars for the 32 hundred megahertz 16
gigabyte kid if you're in Australia 349
AUD and for this price it's really that
trade-off of do you want the memory with
the extra bling because I think this is
the best ddr4 memory that I've seen to
date I've got the Trident Z here as well
and that looks really good but with the
Corsair Vengeance Pro you can control
the lighting effects as well as having
what I thought was a bit stronger a glow
compared to the transi and also pulling
out my thermal imaging camera to test
temperatures at the 3200 mega nodes XMP
profiles show that the heat sinks aren't
just for bling either they actually do
perform quite well
reaching a maximum of 38 degrees Celsius
under a stress test whilst in a 23
degree ambient environment comparing
this to the Trident Z was scoring in the
similar ballpark so the heat sinks
aren't just for aesthetics they're also
for
formitz as well another thing about the
Vengeance Pro is you can also get up to
4000 megahertz XMP profiles however
generally the higher the XMP profile the
more expensive the memory and comparing
it against the previous generation
vengeance RGB which is the non pro you
can't control the led effects on that
but you do get the light spreaders which
diffuse light and they are
non-transferable to the vengeance Pro
they won't fit but you can get that with
XMP profiles up to 40 to 66 megahertz -
and in conclusion to quickly wrap this
up the RGB vengeance per memory it does
perform really well it does have the
bling and it does have the control via
the software however it is a little bit
expensive even compared to the previous
non pro RGB memory so all the extra
features worth that premium that is the
question I will say seeing this stuff in
the flesh and also seeing it at Computex
I was very impressed it is pretty much
the gold standard for RGB memory in 2018
and if you guys enjoyed this video then
be sure to hit that like button let me
know in the comments section below what
you think of this ddr4 memory and I'll
get back to you as soon as I can
catch you on the next tech video very
soon peace out for now they and we are
now at this desk here and i've got some
roasted nut almond bars that i'm going
to be giving away to one lucky person in
the audience I mean I haven't done a not
joke in a while
not so actually behind that we are
giving away a 16 gigabyte kit of
Vengeance Pro memory all you have to do
to enter is click on the link in the
description below
completely free international giveaway
to a gigabyte sticks of this stuff
thirty two hundred megahertz XMP
profiles get a chance to win and I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon repeat myself again he's out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
