do have a video hosting some awesome
tech deals that can be had however I
only do them when there are genuinely
good deals to be had so today's focus
will be mainly on the US Australia and
the UK as there are some decent deals to
be had but I'll quickly get the
International and Canadian deals out of
the way with first and we've got
international $45 h61 and motherboard
couple that with an e3 2013 Andy bridge
which is similar to an i7 2699 dollars
so one hundred and forty-five dollars
shipped to your door you can get a
pretty good combo and it's great for
people in remote areas because the
shipping is included and these guys will
mark it down on customs now if you're in
Canada there wasn't really much for sale
except for a GTX 1050 TI which is going
for two hundred and thirty three
canadian dollars which is actually
really good in the current GPU climate
where cards are practically sold out
everywhere and a 1050 tio will give you
very decent performance at 1080p also on
that note I did post up some really hot
deals for the US and Canada on Twitter
which were time sells on ebay you could
have got 20% off and you could have got
a twenty one by nine ultra wide 144
Hertz 1440p monitor for four hundred and
twenty dollars that was an insane deal
but anyway let's move on with the other
deals better to be had
welcome back to tech yeah City this is
brian coming back to you guys today with
those deals so let's pull up the first
deals in the u.s. here we've got a gtx
1050 going for one hundred and forty
dollars now of course it's not the best
price especially when you look back a
few months but in the current climate
where gtx 1060 is ten 70s and ten 80s
are very expensive this is actually a
great card to tide you over until prices
come down one hundred and forty dollars
is not gonna break the bank and it also
be able to do some 1080p gaming on
medium to high settings in a lot of
titles so pretty good value considering
the current climate of the market now if
you're thinking about building a whole
pc or you just want a whole solution and
you want to upgrade from an older system
there is a HP machine gone for six
hundred eighty dollars contains an i5
7400 four cores four threaded cpu but
it's got a gtx 1060 already installed in
it one terabyte hard drive power supply
motherboard Windows 10 comes
pre-installed too so if you're up to
something more powerful and you want to
build your own machine then the i7 8700
K is currently going for 333 dollars and
you can couple that with a Z 370 pro 4
from asrock which is currently on sale
for one hundred and thirty dollars it's
a very solid combo you will get some
decent overclocks as the IROC
motherboard does have a pretty solid VRM
especially for the price but if you want
to build an AMD system and the value is
definitely there with an asrock be 350
motherboard coming in at $65 can also
couple that with horizon 5 1600 180
dollars that also comes with the cooler
though you may want to wait there are
rumors that the x4 70 and the new cpus
will be released but I'm not too sure if
the new six core will be released
immediately with that launch and of
course arisin 5 1600 at 180 dollars and
that be 350 motherboard is definitely a
good combo even if the new motherboards
and processors are released pretty soon
though it doesn't matter what system you
intend to build whether it be AMD or
Intel you always need a new power supply
to go in a new system and we've got here
these see Sonic focus plus which is a
gold rated power supply 550 watts and
it's fully modular and it's coming in at
67 dollars now you can get a rebate and
drop this down to $52 which makes it
even better value for money so there's
the US deals we're going to move over to
the UK now where you can get a gtx 1050
TI for 158 quid not a bad deal
considering again the current climate
of that GPU market talking about the
vram as well a little bit more powerful
than a 1050 and a little bit more future
proof if you were to use that word
though if you need a CPU i7 8700 K 300
quid be careful though my friend in the
UK he recently showed me some scam going
on I did make a video on this and it's
basically people are buying these and
they're taking the seal off with just
whatever technique they want to use
switching the CPU around for a dodgy one
and then sending it back so if you do
get a dodgy CPU make sure you send that
thing back straight away inform the
seller and get a refund though this is
going for 300 quid it's a solid price
and some other deals were pulling up
here keyboard K 70 rapid fire a hundred
pounds really solid cable it's actually
one of the most popular keyboards that
Corsair have available of course
mechanical switches from Cherry MX as
well this is going to give you a great
typing experience as well as a great
gaming experience too so lots of the
deals we've got here for the UK is a 240
ml water cooler from Coolermaster and
going for 37 pounds it's really good
value for money especially if you want
something that will keep your CPU under
wraps
even when it's overclocked so now for
the last of the deals we're going back
to my city which is check yes Australia
and we're gonna pull out the first deal
here seven hundred ninety seven dollars
for the viewsonic 144 Hertz panel but
here's the thing you can take 20% off
using the code pea spring and this will
bring it down to literally 620
Australian dollars now this is 144 Hertz
32 inch curved screen VA panel this
thing is going to look great for gaming
I've actually got one of these right
here at the moment I'm starting to test
it it's a beautiful monitor it's gonna
be great if you want a really immersive
gaming experience though the next of the
deals are gonna use a GTX 1080 from
Galax $800 off you take 20% off now
these last for another 4 days but again
$800 for a GTX 1080 is not bad
considering the current climate of the
market where you can't really pick up
any graphics cards this is not a bad
deal if you want a high-end gaming
system though what if you were like me
and you loved 5.1 surround sound this is
the current speaker system I'm using and
I absolutely love it it's the Z 906 and
you can get it for 320 Ozzie after you
take 20% off I currently got this exact
same deal a few months ago
and I haven't looked back it's actually
funny because a few of my friends they
come over whenever they come over they
ask me to start putting on music because
this sound system I got around here is
that damn good but what if you want a
decent gaming experience but you don't
have a lot of money when you get the
gigabyte gtx 1050 for around 150
Australian dollars shipped to your door
this is not a bad price considering
again that climate but also with this
card you can pop it in your old machine
regardless of generally what power
supply it has and you'll automatically
be getting a pretty solid gaming
experience at 1080p but what if you want
a solid keyboard for gaming and you
don't want to buy something from
aliexpress which i've featured in the
past I'll actually put the link up here
where you get some really cheap
keyboards but what if you want something
from a brand like Corsair now whenever
our review keyboards from Corsair people
tell me Brian they're really expensive
in Australia where you can get one of
these for $90 now with the k66 it's
mechanical it's got cherry MX red
switches and of course being 90s trained
dolls is not going to break the bank and
plowing through some other deals here
we've got the MX 500 one terabyte SSD
320 Australian dollars shipped to your
door I recently reviewed this thing it
is very solid not just for the money
but in terms of its absolute performance
five-year warranty and the read and
writes are so consistent even after 100
gigabyte file transfer so absolutely
awesome Drive next up here we've got a
GTX 1060 from Galax really solid card I
recently got one of these in I bought it
used however I got it for 285 bucks if
you want a brand new you can get this
thing for around 350 Aussie shipped to
your door and again that current
climbing I'm gonna keep saying it it's
weathering through a storm and this is
actually not too bad of a storm at 350
Australian dollars now what about CPU
and motherboard lovers we've got here
the risin 5 sixteen hundred two hundred
and forty dollars after you use that
coupon code and also if you're after a
really solid motherboard X 370 gaming
k-6 which you can also buy a flash if
you want to upgrade it to the new
upcoming rising processors this is going
for a hundred and sixty or strain
dollars very solid motherboard for the
price so if you want to move over to in
my opinion what is the best in slot CPU
at the moment then the 8700 K is
currently going for just under five
hundred Australian dollars and they just
offer absolutely insane performance
there's no denying that
but what if you're building a new system
and you need a solid power supply to
power that system well the Coolermaster
light 700 watt is on sale for $90
shipped to your door and it's got over
54 amps available on the 12-volt line so
it be able to power even a 1080i powered
system so even if you're building a more
budget orientated system with a 10 60
this power supply will give you great
future proofing and you guys hope you
enjoyed today's deals video if you did

me know in the comment section below if

say all the links and the coupon codes
for all the deals in today's video will
be in the description below and yeah
peace out for now bye
so now
but what if you don't have a lot of
money and you want to build sign this
little it's slim but it's still pretty
powerful where you can get a gtx 1050
for a hundred and sixty Australian
dollars after you take twenty percent
off really not bad at all $19 $38 you
get that cheaper than 160 that's $29
right makes it hundreds 151 roughly yeah
I think that would it okay
great typing experience as well as a
gate game okay now what are we putting a
new power supply and you need a is need
a new power supply in a new build what
we've got here at the see sonic focus
plus which is gold rated fully my pal
