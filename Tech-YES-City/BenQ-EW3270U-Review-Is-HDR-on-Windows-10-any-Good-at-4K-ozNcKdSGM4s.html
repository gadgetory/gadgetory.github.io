the desk we've got the e W 3270 you from
Bank you this is a 4k monitor which has
a VA panel they've got a HDR setting
with four levels of control and what
they call brightness intelligent Plus
technology however just like anything
we're gonna be putting this thing
through its paces today with the I
display Pro and seeing if it's color
accurate seeing if it's good for people
who want a video edit but more
importantly tell you a quick look at the
specs of this thing comes in at seven
hundred and fifty eight US dollars on
Amazon in Australia it's better priced
which is a weird thing lately some of
the products on the channel here have
been priced better in AHS 849 AUD and
currently on eBay I believe you can pick
up only one of these at the moment for
seven hundred and fifty-six AUD so 32
inch monitor 4k resolution HDMI 2.0 you
get two HDMI ports as well DisplayPort
1.4 and also a USB type-c which you can
run the signal and sound through it's
also got a headphone out as well for
pushing out audio but more importantly
how good's the response times Bank you
are claiming for milliseconds I'm going
to test that out today and also they
included stand quickly going through
that it's only tilted just about not
swivel or height adjustable but it is
visa compatible so you can wall mount it
or buy a better custom stand if you wish
you
so here we are now at night time I've
been testing this thing out all day it's
time to get straight into the juicy
details for you guys
response times they're advertising for
milliseconds on the box with a thousand
FPS camera in csgo realistically we're
looking at around 12 to 14 milliseconds
now there are three different levels of
overdrive or essentially one being off
and two extra levels high and premium
they call this AMA or advanced motion
acceleration did work best on the high
setting in my opinion also pulling up a
UFO test did clarify this now looking at
input lag with this monitor looking at
around nineteen to thirty four
milliseconds total input lag and csgo
very good especially for a 4k sixty
Hertz VA panel the vsonic may have just
got a slight edge over this especially
the one that I use for 4k video editing
but nonetheless it's still really good
looking into HDR there is a setting in
Windows when you turn this on everything
looks terrible but when we go over to a
game like Final Fantasy 15 it did work
okay so if the game does support HDR
then it will look pretty good but keep
in mind I thought the picture mode on
photo looked a little bit better there's
also a game mode which brings up the
darks so it does work really well in
games like csgo so this monitor has two
picture profiles that I like out of the
box one being for a more enjoyable
experience that's photo mode the other
being game mode which I did prefer in
competitive shooters like csgo also
moving on with the srgb settings out of
the box if you want to use this for
video editing there's some really good
news and that is that it's pretty damn
close to being color accurate out of the
box it's not as accurate as the
viewsonic monitor which is actually
calibrated out of the factory but it's
very close there's not a whole lot in it
I just tested the magenta levels there
are slightly bit off but everything else
was really close
white uniformity levels are really good
backlight bleed is acceptable and also
there's no visible cross hatching and it
does have quite a strong matte coating
on the screen so you won't see any
reflections that will dissolve those
pretty well however more on those HDR
settings there is a manual mode on the
monitor itself which you've got two
modes as I mentioned in the intro you
can turn HDR on and then you can turn on
the brightness intelligence technology
with both of these on in a fork a demo
on YouTube it did make a difference and
it did look really good and I've also
heard like for the Xbox one for example
that will support HDR so when the
quality can support HDR this monitor
will bring it out and it will look
pretty good thank you also claim the
monitors flicker free I did test this
out and it is true I couldn't find any
flickering going on also the brightness
levels they claimed 300 nits of
brightness I tested it with the software
on the I display Pro and that was
showing around 201 nits of brightness so
it could use a little bit more so it is
a little bit off that advertise 300 but
as long as it can go to 160 comfortably
that I'm comfortable with it too and
there is the overscan feature which you
can turn on and off with this monitor
the OSD is also very friendly and easy
to use you can even set up custom
buttons for yourself with the first two
left buttons as well as it having a
total of seven buttons HDR which is one
of those with the bi technology
integrated power button and then you've
got your clothes menu open menu up and
down in ok buttons and lastly this
monitor there is a smart focus feature
which has a large and small area I found
in practice it didn't really do anything
for me but it is available there if you
need it also the monitor itself has the
AC unit integrated into the monitor
itself which juices around 48 watts from
the wall at least in a game like Final
Fantasy 15 when I looked at the power
consumption figures and also included in
the box is your stand monitor
instruction manuals a USB type-c cable a
power cable and also a mini display to
DisplayPort cable to so now its
conclusion time with the Ben QEW 3270
you monitor and what do I think of it if
you're in Australia for the price
they're asking I mean on ebay there's
one going as I said before for 760 AUD
which is a pretty damn good monitor for
the money in America it's a little bit
more expensive at least in triple P
terms and that's where the line gets
drawn it's a monitor that costs
essentially a set amount of money you
get a V a panel the ghosting is mediocre
the input lag is pretty good the feature
sets nice you've got free sync you've
got speakers onboard you've got good
viewing angles everything checks out but
in my opinion the viewsonic I recently
tested that does have the IPS
panel it is perfectly calibrated out of
the factory and it does get the edge in
terms of input lag and response times
we're actually really good on that
monitor too but in Australia that
monitor costs almost an extra 400
Australian dollars so if you're in
Australia the bank is definitely
bringing better value for money in the
US however the viewsonic costs just
eight hundred and twenty u.s. so it's
literally only just a little bit more
expensive than the bank here in the US
so if I was in the US I'd probably go
for the viewsonic monitor if I was in
Australia probably go for the bank you
monitor that's how pretty much cut and
dry it is it's a solid monitor for the
money but the stand is lacking anything
but tilt adjustment the build quality is
good and it will suit someone who's
getting into video editing and also want
something that'll double down as a solid
gaming monitor at 4k 60 Hertz and of
course one thing you'd gain with the
bank you over the viewsonic is that HDR
support which does work really well if
the software supports it so the YouTube
demo I pulled up that looked really nice
but everything else at the moment looked
pretty bad anyway guys hope you enjoyed
this review if you didn't be sure to hit
that like button if there's anything
else you want to know about this monitor
and be sure to drop a comma in the
comment section below and I'll get back
to you as soon as I can
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
