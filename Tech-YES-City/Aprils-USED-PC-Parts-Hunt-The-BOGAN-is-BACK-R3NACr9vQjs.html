time of the month where we're going
used PC parts sunning on good old gam
tree last month we went to Thailand to
attend the AMD launch event for the
Verizon second gen chips I went there a
day early hunted a heap of motherboards
in Thailand I'll put the link up here if
you haven't seen that one already and
this month already behind the scenes
I've got two really good deals as well
as a subscriber called Nate he came up
to the Gold Coast and traded me ddr3
memory for a GTX 780 Ti so super stoked
about that
we got I think it was twenty eight
gigabytes of ddr3 memory traded that for
a 780ti now also this month picked up an
FX 8350 AMD FX 970 chipset as well as
rock extreme for motherboard and a
cooler master - 12 X cooler for a
hundred and ten Australian dollars which
in the US would be even cheaper since
the US dollar is stronger at the moment
and the last still we picked up was two
videos ago I did the x58 3 PC build
because the ultimate comparisons coming
very soon so stay tuned for that and we
got that for $100 with a 1200 watt power
supply it was packed with RGB LED fans
and an RGB controller - so 1200 watt
power supply case and all that for a
hundred Australian dollars - so what I'm
going to do there is take out the RGB
controller try and flip that for 50
bucks and we would have ended up with a
case power supply for 50 dollars and
also in the previous video you probably
noticed that I need glasses now it's
actually a pretty crazy story we'll tell
that very soon but let's get on with the
parts hunt because I need a lot of
graphics cards I'm out of gravis cards
and we need a restock
so now first listing we got up here is
for a i3 PC so it's got an old school
first gen AI 3 in it and it's also got
four gigabytes of RAM and they're asking
$140 but it's been listed for over a
month not one offer and the thing about
this piece is it's got a full old mid
sized ATX case that doesn't look like
it's an OEM of some sort so could have a
decent power spline it could have a
decent motherboard like an asrock or
Zeus will give you about P 55 so that
coupled with a hard drive and everything
else could be a good pick up so we're
gonna offer $90 for this and as we don't
need the monitor keyboard mouse
they might take that so let's give this
a call yeah so anyway guys this month
we're bringing the Boggan back hey Tim
how are you mate y'all see you got out
here on cam tree for a PC tower monitor
keyboard mouse mate yeah I don't need
the monitor and the keyboard mouse would
you take 90 bucks for it the keyboard
and the mouse would I take 90 bucks you
know I'd rather sell there's one whole
thing yeah available today could I come
check it out eight o'clock all right
mate yeah all right now have you got my
number here thanks I'll come check it
out thanks mate fight okay so that was
kind of a success we're gonna go check
it out if the specs inside are any good
if I can salvage a lot of the gear from
that then I'll go take it for a hundred
bucks even though I don't need to
monitor the keyboard mouse you can kind
of use them but anyway that's kind of a
success first go Boggan is back and is
serious business till we get up here is
a GTX 970 it's the Strix azu Strix these
are pretty popular model to begin with
but we're gonna go with 200 Australian
dollars see if Josh will take that and
I'm hoping he will but the bogan is back
so I've got a good feeling about this
okay so josh is not picking up his phone
we're gonna drop in an offer of $200 see
if you'll take it
so the next deal I guess you could call
it that it's not even really a deal but
it's an AMD radeon r9 290 for you buy so
they're asking $300 but they're hinting
out in the ad that they are really
negotiable so they're saying they got a
brand new for 300 bucks I'm just gonna
call them up and sort of suss it out
rather than more than anything and see
if I can drop in a pretty low offer like
I'm thinking literally like a hundred
and fifty dollars for this card since it
has been up for over two weeks hasn't
had any offers of course I yeah again
whatever let's try it so it looks like
Jackson might be at work or something
the phone's just not picking up at all
but yeah let's move on with the next
deal
so next day we'll get up here's a GTX
780 they're asking 200 I'm gonna drop in
an offer of 140 and they've only listed
it today so they might take it there in
the rang there around the corner
maybe the bogan magic can do something
Here I am doing this path hunt on a
Saturday this time it's not on a Sunday
it's on a Saturday so I don't know what
it is
people just don't pick up their phones
so next up here we've got a GTX 1060
it's a 6 gig model so does command a
pretty decent price here over an oz
brand new it's asking 350 for it I'm
thinking I'll call him up see if he'll
take 290 seems like a pretty fair offer
considering you don't know what it's
been used for but yeah let's give this a
go
next up here we've got two deals that
are up an EPS which which is about 50
minutes from where I live so it's quite
a drive but if I can land both these
graphics cards both these deals then
it'll definitely make about the drive
980ti
375 AUD I'm going to try and drop in an
offer of 340 see if they'll take it it's
only been listed today so it's a pretty
hot graphics card so we'll see if we can
land it oh hey David here you go mate
yeah I saw you've got an ad here on
gumtree for a gtx 980ti
okay
would you take 350 for the gain would go
to drive from the Gold Coast
okay mate do you want to text me your
address and I'll come and get it yeah
yeah absolutely
so I'll text you might like this and
yeah no problem I'll put it I'll put it
on pause pending your arrival thanks
David so you notice I immediately opted
to 350 and that's because he already
listed another one and it already sold
so we landed that for 350 which is an
awesome deal let's try the r9 290 so
Josh isn't answering his phone and I'm
just gonna drop in an offer of 150 and
hopefully by the time we've done the
deals hunt he might get back to me in
the last day we got up here is a small
form-factor PC eight gigs of ram i five
twenty four hundred one terabyte hard
drive and you guys already probably know
Matt I've called him a few times we've
had a few beers in the past I'm gonna
give him a ring I can't put on the bogan
accent obviously because he's got my
number saved in his phone and I'm gonna
offer him 150 even though it's pretty
tight we'll see what he can do for me
dude I've noticed you've got a small
form-factor PC here I five is a twenty
four hundred eight gigs of ram and one
terabyte hard drive yeah would you take
150 for it I'm listening 220 throwing a
2,620 I 720 600 r7
to 1015 and you supply some drinks to
ten and I supply the drinks well I had
no favourites of Zeon's man the
generation before that so there we go
you guys I was prepared to pay a little
bit more I was thinking like 180 he'd
come in at but he's offered to put in an
i7 which is a lot better than the i5
2400 of course you get a higher clock
speed hyper-threading so pretty happy
with that deal 210 bucks and yeah maybe
we can do a video with that case 600
graphics card if it's actually any good
a lot of people have been requesting I
take a look at some Quadros some old
used quadros and seeing if they can
still game so that might be a good video
anyway up until this far you're probably
wondering why I'm wearing glasses in
this video and also the last video as
well and the truth is I've been
teetering on the edge of needing glasses
for quite some years now back in Japan I
got my eyes tested at an optometrist and
they recommended a mild prescription
they said I was long sided and when I'm
reading at close distances my eyes the
muscles in my eyes are having to work
harder and then it wasn't until recent
that the today's video sponsor actually
glasses usa.com they reached out to me
and said that they've noticed in some of
my videos that I have been sweating a
little bit I mean not like dad man
levels where you're super squinting and
he I mean he's long gone he's in denial
he needs glasses big time but he's
always been in denial and he just
refuses to get a pair of glasses so when
they reached out to me and offered me
some free pairs of glasses I said sure
I'll head to the optometrist get my eyes
checked again and it wasn't until then
that the eye doctor that was local she
recommended me a really good
prescription that just really makes a
difference now when I'm reading at close
distances it feels like a strain is
lifted off my eyes so I don't know maybe
some of you guys might want to go get
your eyes checked from an optometrist
and if you need to get some glasses
that's where glasses usa.com comes in
you can get a pair of glasses with lens
prescription lens customized to you
for $30 it's really cheap they've also
got a lot of in-house designs and lenses
with over 4,000 different styles of
frames that go with sunglasses as well
we can get prescriptions in sunglasses
too and the good news is if it's your
first time buying a pair of specs and
glasses usa.com have a special offer for
tech yes city viewers check the link in
the description below also they're
cutting out the middleman giving you
guys really good prices up to 70% off
retail and they offer a one-year
warranty too and a 14 day money back
guarantee with free shipping as well so
what's there to lose not a whole lot and
you might like me gain some extra
nighttime productivity I found at
nighttime these have helped me stay
awake a little bit longer because I
think it towards the end of the day my
eyes just have to strain a little bit
more than they were used to if I didn't
have glasses so big thanks to today's
sponsor glasses usa.com let's get back
onto the hunt
so the morning-after end stop by Matt's
and we got a ten pack and yeah the rest
of the night just disappeared but anyway
guys let's take a look what's on the
table here we've got the PC that we
picked up yesterday that was the first
run and we got this for a hundred AUD
with the monitor and keyboard and also
there was a heat 55 motherboard inside
and a power man power supply so that was
really awesome because this build will
all come together once I clean this
thing out but speaking of being cleaned
out I think we give this a quick data
back right now
so we just finished cleaning this rig
here and I have not seen anything like
that in my life that was crazy the
amount of dust that came off that thing
I had to put my shirt over my mouth so I
didn't breathe in any of this dust but
they look forward to bringing that in
the building and cleaning it all up and
putting a graphics card with it and of
course ordering a Zeeland off Aliexpress
now but here's the PC we picked up off
mat it's already pretty clean because he
has a dot of a key was he actually the
guy who recommended me the data back in
the first place and it's got an i-5 2400
I 720 604 210 s Randall's so pretty good
computer considering it's got one
terabyte hard drive as well and it's
going to have a k6 hundred in it which I
wouldn't mind testing out in a separate
video something like this any decent and
if so what could it play my guess is
probably like legal legends maybe dota 2
if you're lucky and see it go but of
course what about that 980ti surely you
got that Brian well actually I texted my
sister she lived just around the corner
and she went and picked that up for me
so I'm just got to give her some cash
she's already got the 980ti that's been
scored so really look forward to putting
that in a build as well and seeing what
it can do or 2018 and now the guy
actually two guys with the r9 290 s they
both got back to me and I'll take 160
like both of them all take 160 so one of
them is really close to me so I'm gonna
go pick that up like pretty soon and
also another ones in Brisbane but the
guy doesn't get back to a Tuesday or
something so again I might get someone
up in Brisbane to pick that up for me
but let's go get this online 290
so there are these guys we just got back
now picked up the r9 290 and it is a
little bit dusty but the guy accepted
one hundred and fifty dollars I thought
was one hundred and sixty I guess I got
that confused with the guy in Brisbane
and the guy in Brisbane said he will be
back Tuesday night so it's Sunday today
so two days he said he'll accept the 160
offer so the guy she gave me ten bucks
back so I got this for one hundred and
fifty Australian dollars which would be
like a hundred and fifteen USD maybe so
really good deal for an online 290
looking below that this might be a build
right here if I can order a Z on
Aliexpress get that in pretty quick and
maybe get a different power supply we'd
have an awesome build here for like
around about 300 Australian 250 USD
incredible value for money I look
forward to putting that together giving
you guys one epic build so to quickly
recap this month we still got one
outstanding deal I will update the
description if that deal goes through
but we've got two PC's and a spare i
seven 2600 a 980 TI and also an r9 290
we've got all that for our 810
Australian dollars which would be in USD
terms I think off the top of my head
like 620 USD absolutely phenomenal I
look forward to putting some systems
together for you guys showing you the
price performance we can get and
especially that 980ti seeing how it goes
against the latest and greatest high-end
rig because 980 is still a beast of a
graphics card anyway guys hope you
enjoyed this month's use part hunt if
you've got an accent that you want to
hear and it's not too difficult I mean I
can't do the young garden accent I tried
and then people last month said it's a
bad idea anyway because you might
trigger some people or something so if
you've got another accent you want to
hear drop a comma in the comment section
below
most upvoted accent we'll be getting one
phone call at least next month in that
accent so go out of guys also let me
know in the comments your favorite deal
of the month and if you picked up some
deals of your own then drop them as well
also another thing I wanted to talk
about with the used parts hunts since
you guys love it so much I was thinking
of doing an add-on episode every month
where you guys send in your deals and we
sort of make something happen out of the
show where we can give
people recommendations for new Medes so
I wanted to call this show hot used
Medes instead of hot used setups which
of you guys followed in for a while I
promised that a long time ago I was
thinking that's probably not a good idea
because people wouldn't want to buy a
used chair or a used desk but if we look
at maybe hot used Medes with PC parts we
can recommend stuff that's really hot at
the moment so if there's a good eight
core Xeon on sale and it's in stock and
there's motherboards you can couple with
I'll be looking at those deals and also
presenting some other deals that people
have if you pick up something really
obscure something not a lot of people
know about of course get that deal for
yourself first and then I'll recommend
it to the rest of the viewers out there
and now I'm going to be getting out of
here going to the gym and then I'm going
to get ready for the P o D concert on
the Gold Coast tonight they're an old
school band I used to love them back
when I was a teenager so they're playing
here on the Gold Coast I'm gonna go you
see them now got tickets to that and
also big THANK YOU to glasses usa.com to
sponsoring out this video and also
giving me a hand with my eyes really
appreciate it and be sure to check the
link in the description below guys if
you need some specs of your own and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
