$100 gaming PC and see how it runs oh
wait the last time we got this I 5 in
this was the i-5 this was busted it
didn't work because it was missing in
total four resistors on the back and so
that meant I couldn't test the
motherboard either so in that instead of
this I got the i3 this is AI 3 550 so I
managed to get this for about $8 ship
which is really cheap this will enable
me to test the motherboard as well so
and this one's confirmed working which
is a good thing so let's get out of
testing now we've got the CPU in there
the graphics card and everything set up
and the motherboard is working which is
great news we've also got the i3 550 on
there which works as well so now we're
going to do is just quickly install
Windows for you guys and then I'm going
to run some popular games probably
fallout 4 and GTA 5 to see if this
100-dollar PC can be any good at 1080p
gaming
this so now it's time for a bit of cable
management and we're going to use some
duct tape here so let's get it on
so there we have it the $100 gaming PC
is finally finished I did some
benchmarks for you guys and I was
actually really surprised that this
could even run GTA 5 and fallout 4 at
1080p
even though the settings were pretty
damn low it still ran these games
however one thing you may have noticed
from the gameplay footage was that the
games were stuttering and this is my
opinion was due to the fact that it only
had four gigabytes of memory on there so
one thing I would like to do if I could
would be to get a gigabytes of memory on
there just so those games could run a
little bit smoother but for what it's
worth it will run dota2 League of
Legends and csgo perfectly fine since it
was actually managed to run these two
latest games at 1080p so really good
testament to the $100 gaming PC and I
actually managed to do a 3d firestrike
run as well even though it was kind of
like the graphics driver was a bit data
to still manage to do the marks there
and it got 2000 683 so really impressed
with this PC unfortunately I couldn't
overclock it though since the
motherboard is a basic motherboard I may
try updating the BIOS and let you guys
know via Twitter if it can overclock so
quickly touch on some things about the
price this came in at 98 dollars for all
the hardware I did manage to get a
refund on that CPU that i-5 which had 5
busted resistors on it which was pretty
damn bad it shouldn't have even been
sold in the first place however after
that I did play it safe with the i3 for
$1.00 as I really wanted to test the
motherboard and that being said the two
biggest bargains of this buy today or
this PC would have been the ATI 5850
which I scored for around about $30
posted and the motherboard in the junk
PC section which had that and the cooler
and the Dell KACE and power supply all
for like $12 I think so that was a
really good pickup as well so if you're
looking for abused PC and you're looking
with around 100 or $200 then keep in
mind you can get these pcs if you just
look around hard enough and find
something cheap anyway that's enough
from me if you like this video then you
know what to do please give it a big
thumbs up this PC was a big success and
for all those people who want to buy it
I will sell it to someone who lives in
Japan at cost price and no problems I
just really enjoyed doing these things
however I can't ship this PC
international
because it just costs a lot of money to
ship it internationally and I'm sure you
could get something cheaper where you
live with this PC plus the shipping
costs also make sure you stay subscribed
because I have a $200 used PC coming up
soon with an r9 270 in there so I'm very
keen to see how this bad boy goes
especially since it alleviates them the
problem that the $100 gaming PC had so
look forward to giving you guys that and
peace out for now and catch you in
another tech video very soon but yeah I
did bang my head that's why there's like
a red mark there</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
