potato a lot of people in the comment
session were like what do you use to
clean that what's that water stuff that
you're putting on the pots and so today
I'm going to give you guys a complete
detail of the tackiest city approved way
to clean your PC parts
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
tacky s city this is brian coming to you
guys today with a video on exactly what
i use to bring up those disgusting pc
parts and make them look like they're
brand new
now starting from left to right we're
going to start off with the most
important one and one that i get asked a
lot about the most this is the parts
cleaner now this is some seriously
strong stuff and it can eat plastics so
be aware of that
it's called parts cleaner but it's also
known as brake cleaner now this stuff is
very cheap you can get like 800 ml of
this stuff for like around dollar to two
dollars depending on where you live this
cost me about two dollars a can very
high precious stuff really good for
getting that dirt off in those
hard-to-reach places especially around
sockets and pins really good i love it
however that being said if you do use
this stuff try to clean off the excess
as soon as you can with something like
an alcohol wipe because as I said before
this stuff will eat plastic and
depending on the brand it made plastics
a lot faster than others the stuff I'm
using here today is very easy on
plastics compared to some other brake
cleaners so be careful about the brand
that you get this is the one that I use
cheapest from my hardware store and does
a fantastic job of cleaning those parts
now the next thing I use to clean parts
is my favorite by far this is the most
important in my opinion this is the
alcohol wipe it's just a tissue
essentially a wet tissue however they
use alcohol instead of water or any
other chemicals and it's just absolutely
phenomenal for cleaning pretty much
anything now the brake cleaner is pretty
much a more powerful option though when
I don't need to use that and a lot of
the cases I don't need to use that I
just use alcohol wipes this stuff is
great for getting off thermal paste as
well getting off dirt grime and all any
and also cleaning just in general
anything to do with pcs because you know
it's not going to short-circuit anything
on your motherboard or it's not going to
short-circuit anything to do with
electronics and it will dry out pretty
quickly now this stuff can be had for
around about a dollar depending on where
you live I pay about a dollar fifty for
a bucket of like two hundred alcohol
wipes so really handy really useful so
the next batter up here is CRC 556
another one of my specials this stuff
will cost you around three
as a can however it will go a long way
now this one is more of a finisher and
also a protectant as well so it sort of
serves the purpose of making your parts
look really good but also sort of
sealing them in with an oil-based
lubricant now this stuff will not
short-circuit anything I've already
tested it in the past on a live PC no
problems now next up here is some polish
rags another one of our specials this
one will be essentially for just
cleaning anything and not having to
worry about scratching things grate on
GPU dies after you've done the alcohol
wipe you can use a Polish rag clean all
the alcohol off straight away so you put
down your thermal paste or you can use
it for just cleaning up your case giving
it the final polish they're really good
stuff and I again I use one for
polishing off the alcohol and one for
polishing with CRC 556 so at any given
time I've got two of these bad boys out
in the wild next up here is just some
silicon pads this is when I'm pulling
off those old heat sinks and the silicon
pads that were on previously just
crumbles so this has cost you about a
dollar for a big pad like this and it'll
go a long way next up here we got some
zip ties great for cable management I
just love the ace of a zip tie you just
pretty much whack it wherever you want
to whack it and then just strangle it
and that thing will hold in place and
then last up you've got your thermal
paste and I used to be a big advocate of
arctic silver fire but nowadays I'm a
big advocate of mx4 because I can just
be even more loose than I was with artic
silver 5 this stuff is pretty much
performing similar to our tekzilla 5
except you don't have to worry about it
being capacitive or conductive in other
words you can just slap this stuff down
slap a heatsink on it you don't have to
worry about anything shorting out so
after you've got all these items you
should now be able to bring those really
dirty and disgusting parts into
something that looks pretty much near or
even better than brand new is in the
case of using the CRC 556 some of you
guys if you have any questions about
these parts or anything I use in my
process then let me know in the comment
section below and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can also another thing
about some of this stuff is when I
especially when I went to America for a
holiday I could not find for the life of
me alcohol wipes anywhere I couldn't
find polish rags as well these were like
2 things I was going
around every hardware store asking for
other like huh what's that and then I
was like okay they so they've got none
of this you may have to go on to Amazon
to get this stuff but I'm telling you
now these two things are well worth it
especially when it comes to cleaning up
PC parts and saving a lot of time anyway
that's about it from me to you guys if
you enjoyed this video and please slap
that big thumbs up button and I'll catch
you in the next tag video very soon
peace out for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
