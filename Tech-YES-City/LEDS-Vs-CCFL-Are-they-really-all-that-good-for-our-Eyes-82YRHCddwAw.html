fantastic low-power bright source
however when we look under the surface
what lies there might actually scale
welcome back guys it's going to be an
unusual video that I don't usually do so
if you liked it please would have come
in the comment section below if you want
to see more like it however recently the
reason for doing this video and reason
for researching LEDs is that we recently
put in a blue LED light a low vision
late night room and I noticed in the
after about two weeks of using it so
before that we just had a standard
orange bulb in there that blew out but
after about two weeks of using this bulb
I noticed when I'd go to work in the
morning I'd have like black spots in my
eyes and so I started looking up on the
internet you know in my eyes degrading
and do have some disease and I started
looking at LEDs and what I found was
pretty spooked me out however before we
get on to the juicy news we'll look at
what it essentially an LED is
essentially what a common standard LED
is is it's got a blue light source that
has a yellow layer of phosphor and that
converts the blue light into the white
artificial white light so essentially
every time we look at an LED light we're
essentially looking at the core a blue
light and so if we look at the
frequencies here we can see that red
Red's the least
what's the lower frequency it puts a
least little the least amount of strain
on your eyes as opposed to ultraviolet
which is what the Sun emits a lot of
ultraviolet rays but if we look here
White's it's below blue so blue is kind
of up there in the spectrum white sits
below that so what we've got with LED
lights is something that truly is
something that's more intense for what
it's giving us and so these articles
they started researching the effects of
LEDs especially blue LEDs and they found
that in some cases blue light can cause
stress or toxic stress to the retina
especially outside of normal daylight
hours and so the goal of this was not to
use too much blue light and since LEDs
have an element of blue light in them
which we can see whether we like it or
not we're actually looking at you can
see here the spikes here CCFL verse LED
no you don't say a little bit later but
we see you LED lights they have that
spike there blue light which can cause
strain to our eyes so if you're
wondering over the last few years why
your eyesight's probably degraded more
than it should then I mean your eyes
degrade as you get older anyway that
can't be
helped but if you're wondering why your
eyes have probably degraded faster than
usual LEDs might be to blame I've
noticed that my eyesight in the last few
years hasn't been all the best but
before that's been 20/20 perfect so I
might do an experiment where I change
back to see CFL and see how that goes
for you guys maybe you'd like to be I'll
be a human experiment for you hey how
you like that but in the meantime we can
see here that see CFLs the technology
that was mainly used in computer
monitors before LEDs didn't have that
peak of blue light in there so they
probably didn't cause as much stress as
an LED would on your eyes is that
something to keep in mind it's something
that I found really interesting and
something I thought I'd share with you
guys and now in conclusion I will say
that I no I'm not I'm not a man of
science I do love science but I'm not a
physicist I don't know all there is to
know about this stuff so if you guys
want to chime in the comment section
below then please chime in and let me
know what you guys think but I thought
I'd share this information with you as I
thought it was pretty kind of a little
bit scary as well you know so
essentially we're all upgraded to LEDs
and we all think they're beautiful and
amazing but the truth is they might not
be as good as they seem so anyways hope
you enjoyed this video if you did please
give it a thumbs up if if you have any
comments which I'm probably sure you do
then please leave a comment the
conversation below and I'll catch you
guys with another tech video very soon
not an unusual one like this one anyway
