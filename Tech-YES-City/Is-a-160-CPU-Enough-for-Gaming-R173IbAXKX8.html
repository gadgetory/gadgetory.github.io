CPU that comes into roughly 160 dollars
almost half the price of the 7700 K
which is Intel's 4 core 8 threaded CPU
that admittedly overclock siren has
better IPC though one must wonder does
it make a difference when coupled with
mid-range graphics cards well let's find
out
welcome back to tokyo city and today we
have the gtx 1060 from Oris and also the
rx 580 from sapphire both overclocked
and coupled with the horizon 514 hundred
which is overclocked to 4 gigahertz and
also coupled with this 7700 K which is
overclocked to 5 meters and we're going
to compare these two CPUs head-to-head
to see how much of a difference the 7700
K premium Nets you in terms of FPS with
mid-range graphics cards at 1080p so
without wasting any more your time let's
roll dem benchmarks
boy
and like always the benchmark do the
talking and what we saw here across
seven different games is that the 7700 K
although it edged out the r5 1,400 it
really didn't edged it out by a whole
lot it's not like you'd want to go and
spend that extra hundred and sixty
dollars if you were getting a mid-range
graphics card the rosin file 1400
provided really good performance I was
really surprised also in battlegrounds
aswell players on Nolan's battleground
scoring at over 80 average FPS so the
biggest outlier on this graph was GTA 5
with the Nvidia graphics card it was
getting almost 50 percent more FPS with
the 7700 K so keep in mind with these
tests I do like to drop the settings
just a little bit I usually put it on a
custom blend of high settings and
relatively low msaa this allows me to
get high FPS and still maintain good
visual quality and it's something that I
like to do with my benchmarks so when it
comes down to it the Rison five fourteen
hundred and seventy seven hundred k both
did a great job of maxing out these
mid-range graphics cards however with
the verizon v 1400 it does come in a lot
cheaper than the 7700 k so if you are
building a computer like a lot of people
they like to build computers every few
years and just not upgrade at all and
just sell that old computer if you're
one of these people than the Raven v
1400 coupled with a mid-range graphics
card is really good value for money at
the moment however with the resin CPUs
in itself if you have the extra money I
always recommend going for the rising 5
1600 it's only a little bit more money
than that 1,400 you get a bigger cooler
included and of course you get two more
cores and four more threads which makes
a big difference especially in this
build if you get the CPU you can
possibly just upgrade your GPU in the
future and still have really good
performance the list for the 7700 K you
do pay a premium over the rise and CPUs
but it is currently the best CPU for
gaming X 299 may change that but that's
yet to be seen if that's going to be
worth the money even over the 7700 K but
with the rising CPUs what we saw here
today is if you are a gamer and you just
want to get really good performance for
the dollar and the rising CPUs do offer
fantastic value for money and also if
you're a competitor
gamer then I will be releasing a video
comparing the 7700 K to the risin 5 1700
to see how much of a difference that is
in competitive multiplayer titles and
with that test I will be dropping the
graphical settings as opposed to this
video it's more about getting a really
good experience when you are gaming and
if I guys if you enjoy today's video
then be sure to hit that like button and
let me know in the comments section
below if you were to build a PC today
what pots would you use love reading
your comments as always and I'll catch
you in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
