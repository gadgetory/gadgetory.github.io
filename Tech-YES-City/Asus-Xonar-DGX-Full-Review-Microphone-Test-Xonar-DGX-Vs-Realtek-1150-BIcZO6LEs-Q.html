city's brain is coming back to you guys
today with a review and unboxing of the
Zeus zona dgx 5.1 PCI Express sound card
now this can be had for about thirty
dollars so it is relatively inexpensive
and also it does have some features like
it has dual dual headphone amps on the
rear and the front port but anyway we'll
get to the review soon but I'm going to
say if you guys want to check out this
sound card versus an onboard audio
solution the realtek LC 1150 from msi or
from Realtek but the onboard audio
solution for the msi you can check that
out in episode 3 of quest for perfection
where i'm going to be comparing this
versus the msi onboard audio solution
and seeing which gives the best frame
latencies and seeing if there's any
difference to FPS so you can check that
out I put the link in the down in the
description below but in the meantime
let's get on with the review and check
out what this has and what features it
has and also I'll be testing at the end
of this video the mic in on this because
a lot of people want to buy these for
streaming so we'll see how good this is
versus the realtek ALC 1150 mic in in
this review so anyway let's get on with
the review okay so here's the product
itself once you open the box you get the
sound card it actually it's wrapped up
just taking it out of the wrapping to
make this a little bit faster and
smoother so here's the sound card itself
this is what you get it's a nice black
theme which I must give kudos to azuz
for getting that right it really looks
good in your when you place it inside a
black with a black motherboard black
case it blends in well we'll get onto
this a little bit later let's have a
look what else we get in here so you get
a small form-factor bracket so if you
wish to install this on a mini ITX case
or something like that you can do so
with this bracket it also comes with two
little screws for doing the low profile
bracket mount I won't be needing that
though and also it comes with the driver
CD the dgx driver CD you can also
download the latest drivers from the
internet which I'd recommend doing and
you get the manual here so it does come
packaged pretty well I do
kudos to Zeus it is a really nice sort
of product to unbox but here's the
actual card itself okay so here is a
close-up of the card you can see here it
features the C media CM 8 7 8 6
dark and a DC that is since it can't be
processed via PCI Express directly it's
converted by this as media chip here now
the HD front panel out audio output you
can plug that into this and it will
support that
it also supports switching as well so if
you plug it into the front and you
already have something in the rear it
will switch the front panel also the
it's important to note this has the
audio ad is 105 decibels signal noise
ratio also the audio end is 103 decibels
signal noise anything over 100 it's
pretty damn good so this is already
winning in that department now the thing
to note about the headphone app is that
there's two of them so it doesn't matter
if you plug it in the front or the rear
your headphones going to get amped the
mic in however only has one app and
that's on the rear so if you're using
your mic in on the front panel you may
wish to switch it to the rear to get a
better signal-to-noise ratio now looking
at the rear of the card here you can see
that you've got the line mech in there
done like a hybrid there and I don't
mind cost-cutting when it's smart like
that so that's good they've got the
front audio out let's just standard
audio out point if you're using
headphones and also has support for
analog
surround sounds so if you want to use
your front speakers side speakers and
your subwoofer you can do that there
with those three ports it also has
digital out there s/pdif out which you
can also use off the front panel so you
can also plug in an external if you want
to so that's a good feature there
overall though the product does look
very sleek I like to look at this
product it looks very good so now I'm
going to install this sound card and
I'll do some tests for you guys but it's
also important to note that this does
come with dolt as you did see that does
come with Dolby emulation software so
you can emulate 5.1 surround sound and
it also has a Zeus's EAX 2.5 which is
about they meant to be really good and
another thing is to with the headphone
apps it will and it can match your ohms
on your headphones which is a really
good feature so let's move on to I guess
I'm just going to test the mic in on
this thing for you guys I'm also going
to tell you what I think of the sound
card after using it yes let's have a
look alright so here is a test with the
on I mean no sorry the sound cards
microphone in this is on the rear this
is turned all the way up with microphone
boost and it's come no effects at all
all completely unedited with the sound
so hopefully you guys can hear it it
does sound pretty good I don't know I'm
going to see for myself anyway
I will now compare this to the onboard
MSI real tech LC 1150 with MSI's onboard
app so we'll compare that now let's do
the comparison anyway we'll switch over
to the MSI now ok now we have a test
with the realtek LC 1150 microphone in
this is 30 decibel gain and all the way
up just like these loose was hopefully
you guys can hear the difference I'm
going to be checking I definitely know
there is a difference because I have
tested this MSI thing before I have
tested the mic in so yeah you can
probably hear the noise okay let's jump
onto the conclusion so this is a 48
killer it's both tests we're down to 48
kilohertz 16 bits are recording and same
microphone so let's move on to the
conclusion so in conclusion I will say
that the Zeus zonar mic in port is a lot
better than the onboard audio and keep
in mind this is some of the best onboard
audio coming out at the moment as well
the MSI has the audio boost I mean the
output is amazing on the MSI's onboard
audio to get me wrong but the mic in is
just a little bit weak so I think if
you're a streamer and you're looking to
get you know a good input on a budget
then a sound card like the zuzo not
definitely has a place I thought in the
audio test though when I compared the
azuz sonar to my onboard real tech 1150
I thought the real tech 1150 actually
sounded better for music as opposed to
the Zeus sounding better for games and
this is mainly because I thought the
Zeus had higher mids but I thought the
real tech 1150 had higher you know more
definitive bass and more definitive
highs so I thought either way they both
won in different areas in terms of
output but input definitely went to the
zoo so now the mic in is amazing on that
thing so I already have a microphone
preamp so it doesn't matter which one I
use so if you have a good onboard audio
solution then I suggest getting maybe a
mic preamp if you have a mediocre
on board audio solution then the azuz
own are definitely is a great solution
for you one more thing to note also that
the front output the headphone output on
the zoo sonar
actually was weaker the signal was
weaker than the rear the mic input
actually was the same on both front and
rear
so that's surprising enough I thought it
would have been the other way around but
it actually was the output on the front
that was actually weak so there's
something if you want to put your
headphones in put them into the rear
port you'll get a better app output now
a lot of people are saying well you know
I put it I've used the sound card it
makes such a big difference and I think
with these people is it's mainly not the
fact that the D the digital audio
conversion or the audio digital digital
conversion is better it's just that the
fact that the amps better because the
amp on this sound card is good when you
compare that to a lot of onboard audio
solutions which have weak amps when
people put on the headphones they're
like oh my god it's so much better
that's because they're getting a
stronger signal in essence MSI with the
realtek 1150 they've actually put in a
good headphone amp so I could test these
I tested flak music I tested rap mystify
my INXS that's an old-school eighties
song I tested some deadmau5 and I
noticed yeah that at the same sound
levels yeah the real tech sounded
actually better for music but for gaming
I could definitely hear footsteps and
voice better especially in music as well
I could hear the voices better with the
zoo sonar so that's just my thoughts on
it overall I will give this product a
big thumbs up it's only $30 it is a
great solution onboard solution I mean
PCI Express solution sorry and it does
look nice it's black it looks sleek and
it does work as intended so really good
features about it so the software I
turned it off though as yeah as you know
I don't really like playing around with
equalizations I like getting a pure
signal straight from the source
you guys I hope you enjoyed this review
if you did please give it a thumbs up
and also if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment the
comment section below and this is the
part where I plead you to sub please
