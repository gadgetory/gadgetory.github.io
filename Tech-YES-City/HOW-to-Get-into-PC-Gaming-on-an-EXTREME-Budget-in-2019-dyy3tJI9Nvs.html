whether deals are good or not and also
how to get into PC gaming on the cheap
and so today I'm going to take you guys
through some of the mindset and behind
the scenes stuff that would go into my
head when I look at pcs and I look at
what you can do with them so first part
here we'll start off with how to just
get into PC gaming with fps a smooth
experience stutter free and one that
will give you a good experience even for
titles in 2019
so basically graphics cards like this
you'll want to find a good GPU whether
you're gonna buy a PC of someone brand
new used the graphics card is the most
important part for getting games to run
properly this is the gtx 750ti now you
can get these for very cheap online a
lot of people locally will sell them
because they're upgrading their GPUs but
it'll still give you a good experience
at 1080p low settings or in cases of
Apex legends for example you may have to
drop it a 720p but in the same case
you're still gonna get a smooth
experience this graphics card beside it
is a very good buy
it's my personal favorite at the moment
both on the use market and the new
market since it comes in at roughly just
over $100 u.s. if you buy a brand new
used market you can get these things for
as low as 70 US dollars so they're very
good and price performance is through
the roof this will play 1080p games on
high settings on practically any title
even in 2019 now right behind it is a
key ingredient if you want to get into
PC gaming on the cheap these are what we
call OMS or just basically pcs that have
been pre-built
they're generally non overclockable but
they come loaded with a motherboard a
CPU some memory and in this case I got
an SSD which just makes the deal that
much better so Falls you wanted to do
was play games and get into PC gaming
the knows you'd have to do is grab this
grab this card slot it into this
motherboard turn the PC on and you'd be
good to go you'd be actually getting a
decent experience for very cheap for
instance I got this PC here off a deal
locally for a hundred and thirty five
Australian dollars which
be around a hundred USD very cheap this
gravis card here I got it in on a
trade-in I don't really know how to
price it up but it came in on a trade-in
that I gave the person a hundred ozzie
dollars for and of course that came
loaded with other goodies as well so I
mean maybe realistically you'd be
looking at around 50 Aussie dollars for
something like this tops I've seen him
go for cheaper but you'd have for under
200 Australian dollars a good PC gaming
experience if you just went out of your
way to go look for some deals and go
find the right parts for you
now right there is how you would get
into PC gaming for very cheap and a lot
of the times these motherboards will
come with Windows 10 Pro pre-activated
as well so you don't even have to go out
and buy a CD key but if you are in the
market for a Windows 10 single end user
license then today's video sponsor s CD
keys have you covered you can get this
for as little as 13 US dollars by using
the coupon TYC SK as soon as you put
this in the card apply the coupon you'll
get a 12 percent discount I've been
using these CD keys personally and
they've all checked out they're all
single and user license as well so
they're not that om stuff that you hear
bad stories about so if you are getting
into PC gaming then the links in the
description below
so now for this first part we're gonna
take a look at how to get some of these
deals even online which really pales in
comparison to picking up some of those
local deals but taking a quick look on
eBay and this is even on the back of
just coming off videos where else
linking OEMs in the description so all
the real good OEM deals online have been
sold out I can't really find any except
for this one sort of combination here
we've got a Dell small form-factor 7010
series and you could couple that with
something like this gtx 960 whack that
into the computer and then you should
have a gaming pc for like 150 US dollars
just looking at what this guy did of
course it will look very ugly but it
should still play games especially on a
budget now if you did need a 6 pin power
connector you can buy a side of the 6
pin or side of the 6 + 2 pin for round
$1 so this first part where there's a
will there's a way if you're looking for
those deals you can definitely still
come into something even on ebay but
something like this it doesn't look that
good and around tech es city I do things
a little bit different - I guess the
normal guy wanting to get into PC gaming
I'm looking at this thing and saying
okay how much resale value could I get
off this and so with that I'm going to
be looking at the case how good it looks
and also the specs inside there needs to
be a balance between the two at
different price points since this case
just screams to me low budget we're
gonna be putting some low budget parts
in it and taking out the good stuff
which in this case would really only be
the SSD if we take that out we can put
in say a 250 gigabyte hard drive and
then also whack that 750 Ti in and then
we can put it up for sale but we do have
another one of these cases lying around
now this has a nicer zeus motherboard
inside it's also got an i5 3470 just
like the last one but instead we're
gonna be putting an i3 inside this thing
so taking out the motherboard and then
putting in a different motherboard as
well as like a GT 740 then we'll have
another budget PC up for sale in
relation to this case and the power
supplies in these although they're not
anywhere near decent they
still play games with low powered
graphics cards absolutely fine I'd
estimate that they'd have about 200
watts available reliable 200 watts on
the 12 volt line and so if you're buying
a power supply if you see the 5 volt
beside it and that's got a higher rating
that's generally an indication of a
budget power play that won't power
anything that requires even an 8 pin
connect on the GPU for example but guys
let's clean these things up and get this
show on the road
so there's one computer done right there
and we're gonna be doing a little bit of
multitasking or if you're a lady
multitask yet so there's two PC's ready
to go for a budget gamer obviously this
is aimed at someone who isn't watching
this video and doesn't want to do what
I've done here and so hence that's where
the premium comes on top that nothing
stopping any one of you guys out there
in the audience
unless of course as I've said before in
the past you're in a terrible location
for getting deals but besides that
there's nothing stopping you from just
going out getting something like this
budget graphics card putting together
something really really budget but also
still looks decent and has some good
price performance so here's a bit of a
different combo on the desk here this is
the step up from what we just did we've
got the RX 570 we've got a better
motherboard we've got the same i-5 we're
gonna put a gigabytes of RAM in because
that's really all you need to get it
into 1080p gaming of course you could
put an i7 in this thing 16 gigabytes of
RAM it wouldn't set you back a whole lot
extra and then we've got the one
terabyte hard drive coupled with the 120
gigabyte SSD very popular combo for that
sort of mid-range setup where you've got
enough space for your games we've also
got that fastboot Drive and if your
favorite game you play a lot you can put
that on the SSD too now we've got a
little bit of a bit
power supply here it's still nothing
super fancy but I speak to the guys at
the local retailers they tell me the
failure rates and how many of these
power supplies come back this one here
is not a bad option it's the little
thermal tech it comes in at about 40
something Aussie dollars they don't come
with any box so they're just masts
bundled OEMs and you've got about 370
watts available down the 12 volt line
which is perfectly fine for this
combination here but right now there's
this liquidation sale on the Gold Coast
a computer shop is just selling out a
lot of their old stuff I'm gonna go down
there and check it out and see what
bargains they have and also take you
guys along with us so let's get on a tea
so just got back from meeting up at that
liquidation sale and that was Dan and he
was a really nice guy and of course most
most Aussies are really awesome people
so if you guys are overseas if you ever
come down under you have a great time
but this is the z87 x0c force and this
was like a really nice board we got this
these three sort of mediocre boards here
as well as a g1 sniper and we got two
cases CMP 500s they had like 600 watt
power supplies in them and also another
300 case for 370 Aussie dollars total so
that's like 260 USD so that was a pretty
good deal they had a lot of other like
z97
and also like h1 70's and stuff like
that I'm not pretty interested in that
stuff at the moment because ddr4 memory
and of course some of those new rise and
boards they're so cheap couple with the
fact that horizon 5 2600 is the price
that it's at I just don't see myself
buying those boards and extracting much
value out of them especially for
flipping or putting any other use price
performance but this here of course you
can always make something out of these
individually I'll quickly put up a list
of the prices I paid for all the parts
individually at that sale but with that
said let's put that off the desk and get
back to whipping up this PC right here
so for this next part this is where you
have a lot more choice because your
budget is a lot bigger than in the first
scenario and so for instance for a case
we could spend around $45 get a fractal
design focus G this is definitely one of
my favorite budget cases that still
carries a very clean aesthetic for the
motherboard if you can't find any of
those OAM deals you can go on Aliexpress
get a motherboard for around $40 a I 7
Zeon equivalent 2nd gen for around $60
and then some ddr3 and you'll still have
a bare-bones kit for around about 130
dollars this should still game
absolutely fine and this is readily
available too so this next part is sort
of mixing and matching and this CPU
combo that I've listed here will
definitely tee up with an rx 570 and if
you're on a budget will give you
great performance so I'll put some links
in the description below for the second
part let's keep moving on
so now we're finished the mid-range PC
and this one's looking pretty good it's
got the red LED fan it's a little bit
blinged up you've got a better GPU
you've got an SSD this time around still
using a very similar quad-core CPU I 535
50 so we're kind of mixing new and used
parts with this next build and so that's
where I'd be like you see my thinking
here we've got at the lower end all use
parts we're gonna get a phenomenal price
performance mid-range if we want a
little bit of cedex coupled with still
really good price performance we can mix
a bit of new in with the build now for
this last grand finale we're gonna make
all new parts so let's look at a higher
end system we're gonna be using an
Archie X 20 70 and whatnot but we'll
quickly lay all the parts out on the
table and then talk about that it's a
pretty late at night but it doesn't
matter the hustle never stops I mean I
went and saw some Captain Marvel movie
tonight and it was pretty good
definitely an appetizer for the Avengers
so I can't wait to see that but let's go
all these pots on the table anyway so
now the next build we got here is I
guess you could say higher end gaming
and still keeping the prices reasonable
if I had to tell you this whole build up
here I'd say it's around maybe 14 to
1500 ozzie dollars which considering
this card here the 27 he does trade
blows with a 1080 GI that's really not
bad going and we've got 6 cores 12
threads of Rison 5 2600 goodness now of
course we're gonna use the included
cooler it's actually really good and
then we've got a 1 terabyte hard drive
and a 240 gigabyte SSD this time so
we're gonna step things up and 16
gigabytes of ddr4 memory dual channel
Rison definitely needs that stuff we
will have to tune this to around 29 33
megahertz because that seems to be like
the minimum buffer you want to get for
this CPU and then get smooth performance
out of it obviously a x3 70 motherboards
they go for really good prices and you
don't really need a high-end motherboard
for the six core the eight core if
you're gonna start overclocking that
pretty hardcore then yes you might want
to look for something like a Taichi or
something better but then we've got a
500 watt power supply because we're not
really gonna be overclocking this thing
that hard 500 watt powers by is gonna be
absolutely fine for the
build and it's a decent one - I've been
using a few of these they're 80 plus and
they work really well however they do
only work in Australia 230 volts so if
you're in the u.s. definitely don't try
and plug up one of these 230 volts or
you'll be having a early birthday
surprise but it's not really surprised
it'd be like the antonyms of surprise
which I don't even know that would be
like a mess a shock yeah shock anyway
let's build this thing put it together
and then wrap it up
so there's a lost PC it's finished we're
installing Windows 10 on it but right
now I'm really tired I'm about as tight
as that guy who was counting to 1
million well I'm not that tight but in
the morning we'll come back here and
summarize for you guys what you can do
if you want to get into PC gaming and
you're on a budget that depends on what
budget you're on you want to get the
most for your money and you definitely
want to be taking a look at both the
used market and the new market but let's
talk about that once my brain has
recharged and here we are guys we built
three different pcs at three different
price ranges but my thoughts behind it
were if you're on a budget
you'd probably want to get the most
price performance possible and that's
where we looked at an OEM plus a
graphics card that we can just slot in
there and we'd have happy days the
mid-range we can step it up to like an
rx 570 be a bit more flexible with our
budget to go from maybe a Xeon used and
still get some really good price
performance and value for money on these
parts as well as getting of course that
aesthetics upgrade with something like a
fractal design Focus G for 45 bucks
which is really good value in my opinion
in Australia these cases cost like 80
Aussie dollars so that thing shipped to
your door for 45 USD is a really good
deal now the last part is where we're
putting all new parts together and
you've got a lot more flexibility and as
I just showed before it's really good
time to be building new PC parts and in
fact I might be making a dedicated video
just two new parts and how they're sort
of back up on the rise again because a
lot of these ddr4 prices have come down
the motherboard prices are really good
for new motherboards at the moment and
of course the CPUs with Rison whether it
be the AP use or the CPUs have really
brought prices down in general and then
not to mention the graphics cards the
cryptocurrency boom is finished there's
so many different graphics cards out
there you may even wish to kind of
consider buying all new parts except for
the graphics cards because some of them
are just going out on really good deals
