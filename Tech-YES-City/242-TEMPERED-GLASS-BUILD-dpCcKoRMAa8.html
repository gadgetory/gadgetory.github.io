we have a 242 dollar bill featuring a
new case and something that performs
similar to a new build with a 1050 Ti I
know crazy right and I've even put a GPU
back plate on my GPU so I'll put the
template here for you guys you can
download it 3d printed but let's take a
look at how this thing performs
so you may be in the market for a new PC
you might even be interested in spending
$500 plus and getting something like a
1050 TI and a brand new G 45 60 or AMD
rather than three but today's PC will
give you similar performance in fact the
GPU the GTX 670 that we're using scored
almost identical to a 1050 TI when
they'll both overclocked versus
overclocked so impressive performance
out of today's graphics card and
speaking of that it did come in at 65
u.s. dollars now pick this up in Japan
when I was used parts hunting in Tokyo
we also managed to get a hard disk drive
from Western Digital 500 gigabytes
plenty fine for today's build $15 and
then for the case we're going with the
Nova T G new case from BitFenix and it's
got tempered glass this comes in at $59
and we'll talk about that separately
later in the video but for the memory we
had to add four gigabytes on and that
was an additional 20 us to the build
because we got the motherboard and four
gigabytes of memory in a bang up case
that we picked up into used junks pot
store in Japan and then of course the
power supply I'm using a $10 heck this
thing is perfectly fine for today's
build and you can usually tell what a
decent power supply will look like
because it will have a strong 12 volt
line compared to the five and 3.3 volt
lines usually doesn't always work like
that the general indicator this power
supply will be okay until of course it
blows up so for the CPU we're going with
the i5 750 this is usually a $35 CPU on
Aliexpress four cores four threads
actually performs quite well in thinner
bench at scores around 400 and something
points when you overclock it under
clocked the stock clocks it doesn't
perform too well so you will want to
overclock the CPU and in fact if you
want to buy this CPU I highly recommend
going with the xeon variants for the
same money $35 on Aliexpress X 30 450
this has four cores and it also has
hyper-threading so eight threads to the
same money not to mention all probably
overclock better so for the cooler we're
going with an $8 the LGA 775 sis or
slice depending on how you say it I'm a
bit of a Star Wars fan so I like to call
it assist the law
Akua $8 this thing performs extremely
well because it's an LGA 775 cooler
though the motherboard we've got lucky
today in that the model that we are
using has support even though it's an
LGA 1156 motherboard it has support for
LGA 7m five cooler so awesome build
totaling in at 242 US dollars or if
you're in Australia 305 or stranded
however for this money you may be
wondering how this thing performs so
let's take a look at the performance
figures
Pub G very popular game in fact I
believe it hits more concurrent players
than counter-strike csgo did so this
game is no joke
a lot of people want to play it this rig
here performed on medium settings at
1080p 40 to 50 frames per second then
when I dropped it to low settings which
a lot of pros do play on this resolution
50 to 70 FPS so the frames were really
smooth especially on a budget where
you're going to get a 60 Hertz monitor
this thing was performing perfect for
pub G overwatch high settings a hundred
and twenty FPS pretty much constantly
great to see that also in this game the
GPU and the CPU were being utilized
pretty much near 200% on both which
means it was a perfect balance of
graphical settings for the CPU and the
GPU to handle at the same time though of
course every time you do a PC build is
always that person in the comment
sections like yo Brian where the GTA 5
benchmarks at yo dog and so we've got it
here guys GTA 5 a hundred FPS on normal
settings so it's hovering around those
settings of course going higher and
lower depending on the scene in the game
and then we had that game that everybody
wants to play Avengers Lego Marvel
Avengers Lego we're scoring a hundred
and fifty FPS at 1080p I didn't even
know how to play this game the controls
are all messed up so if you are a
console game you'll probably fit right
in with this game I believe it was
designed for console then it was allowed
in port to PC then for the last game we
had Mortal Kombat X looks pretty cool
actually I got into the story a little
bit I couldn't play for the life of me
but the FPS was locked at 60fps and it
was a smooth experience with all the
gravity settings maxed out at 1080p so
this computer quite simply had the grunt
to perform what was necessary of it I
was quite impressed with the performance
though what about the overclocking on
this thing which is a very important
factor usually with a lot of the news
pcs I do overclocking is crucial so on
this PC the i5 750 initially it comes
out at two point six six gigahertz on
all cause now we managed to overclock
this to three point seven gigahertz I
did get it to three point eight and even
boot it in at three point nine however
at three point eight after around about
five minutes it would just quickly
throttle or quickly switch off which is
indicative
something throttling and something not
having the requirements to run at this
frequency so I dropped it down to 3.7
gigahertz where it was able to be either
stable for at least 10 minutes which is
crucial for me especially if I want to
jump into benchmarking and gaming since
I don't have a whole lot of time but
this thing at 3.7 gigahertz was
performing quite well now for the GTX
670 the graphics card out of the box
this thing is quite aggressively clocked
it's the galaxy version and this
happened before galaxies went bankrupt
or something and then they rebranded as
galaxies so this is actually a really
cool looking graphics card and it
performs really well to scoring in at
around 60 degrees Celsius when it was
overclocked with the fan set to 75% now
on this graphics card you can only max
the fans to 75% which is kind of cool
and interesting but not cool at the same
time though the overclocks were
impressive scoring well over thirteen
hundred and fifty megahertz which for
the Kepler series of graphics cards is
an impressive overclock by putting this
build together or if you guys want to
put together a use PC I recommend
testing out all the pots beforehand in
this case I had the motherboard RAM and
CPU all in there at the same time with
that power supply booted up and it
booted up fine on the first go I was
kind of lucky sometimes you will have
problems with use parts and diagnosing
can be a pain in the ass that's always
the risk that's going to exist versus
new parts where even if you have a
faulty new part you can just send it
back for warranty especially if you buy
all the parts from the same store
however in this case everything was
smooth sailing and the case the Nova TG
let's talk about that a little bit it
came in at 59 USD recommended retail
pricing now when I was at Computex they
said it was going to be 49 USD though
they didn't give me a hundred percent
confirmation they did advertised at $10
cheaper at Computex so I am a little bit
disappointed to see it coming in ten
dollars more expensive however at $59 it
is a really nice case cosmetically and
also building in this thing was very
easy cable management was quite smooth
there was enough drive bays I believe
three for both the hard disk drives 3.5
inch and 3/4 SSDs there's also two
optical drive bays included which I'm
kind of not a fan of I have
use an optical disk drive for years now
so I'd like to see the existence of
those drive bays terminated from this
case in the future also another
improvement with this case I believe
they could mesh the top of the case to
let the air out simply as it stands this
case one big problem with it is a kind
of access of sarcophagus for your parts
now the total power consumption of this
bill which is kind of a mid-range PC so
if you've got a GTX 670 and a four core
Rison or something and you overclock
both those cards then you should be
pulling it around similar numbers in
power consumption this PC was going 350
watts and quite simply the temperatures
were at least a good 10 degrees higher
with the tempered glass side panel on as
opposed to off now one good benefit
about this case is it does have two
included stands so it will do a decent
job of cooling especially if you're
going with a G 45 60 and a 1050 TI or rx
550 then having the side panel on is
going to do fine there's not going to be
much of a difference but if you're going
for those mid-range parts and you're
coupling with this case for the
cosmetics which are really good in my
opinion
then you will suffer with the
temperatures so I'd like to see that
improved in the future and as I said
before I believe the easiest way to
improve that is just to put a meshed top
on the case to let the air vent out at
the top of the case however besides that
there's nothing really that I could
fault about this case includes a USB 3.0
is a solid option it looks nice and that
dark shade on the tempered glass does
look very slick indeed so I am liking
the nova TG there there are a few little
things I'd like to see improved in the
next reiteration if they were to do that
anyways hope you enjoy today's video and
if you did then be sure to hit that like
button and let me know in the comment
section below what you think about this
case right here and also the build love
reading your comments as always actually
haven't given this thing a name yet so
you guys can brand it whatever name and
the most uploads will be the name of
this new PC and also don't forget to
check out at forums Tech City TV slash
forms if you want to join a new home
where we just constantly discussed
random things both tech and non tech and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
