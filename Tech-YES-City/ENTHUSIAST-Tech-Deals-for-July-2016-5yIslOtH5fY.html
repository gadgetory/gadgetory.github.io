and gentlemen this is bryan coming to
you guys today with the enthusiast tech
deals for the month of july in 2016 so
let's take a look at what we've got on
the plate this month and hopefully it's
just as good as a ribeye Phil at stake
so the first deal i have for you guys is
a 700 watt power supply here from EVGA
this thing's coming in at $55 and it's
got 56 ants available on that 12 volt
line there so it's going to be great for
someone who wants to build a high in x99
build and a high end graphics card but
also for someone who's starting out with
a building doesn't have a lot of money
but also wants to have a bit of future
proof there on that power splain that
they don't have to spend extra money in
the future if they want to upgrade their
budget rig the next deal i have for you
guys is 16 gigabytes of ddr3 memory here
from p.m. Wyatt's the XL a branding that
has heat sinks on it and sorts of
eighteen hundred and sixty six megahertz
memory cells pretty good stuff it's also
coming in at $53 which is what makes it
so appealing so great deal there if
you're getting into a first system build
the next deal I've got here is pretty
decent it's a Z 97x mobo here from
gigabyte so this thing is going in at
ninety dollars and you'll be out a
couple that if you're quick with a 47
70k that in the news section is going
for two hundred and thirty dollars so
not a bad combo therefore forth towards
eight threads that's overclockable and
it's also pretty good not as good as
skylight but not far behind at all
especially for the money you're gonna be
getting a very good deal especially if
you don't live near microcenter the next
deal i have for you guys is some
headphones here from philips this is the
SHP 9500 now i reviewed these a little
while ago and they're very good value
for money especially at $63 which is
what they're currently going for they
did have a big rush there where the
price went up but i'm safe to say that
the price is now come down to a level
that's really good value with these
headphones now if you also want to
couple it with a v-moda rip off which
finally there is one available for $22
you can get this microphone here as well
which i'll put the link in the
description below it seems to be getting
some decent reviews already and it comes
in around ten dollars cheaper than the
v-moda boom pro so great combo there if
you're on a budget also on that note of
headphones i did manage to find one pair
of HD 558 s going for like fifty four
dollars in the youth section but they're
like new so that is a bargain there i'd
recommend someone jump on that if they
need some good headphones ASAP another
last deal i have for you guys is a 480
you bite SSD from sand s4 $109 this is a
pretty damn quick drive it's also pretty
reliable and it's just a good price it's
not really so much a deal as opposed to
it's just really good value for money
and lastly I know you guys are thinking
what about graphics cards well if you
just wait a little while there should be
stocks coming in for RX for 80 s also
the custom editions coming out and
hopefully stocks for GTX 10 70s get
replenished as well they're going to be
the two cards to look out for and in the
meantime until they're released you can
expect some prices to be up there a
little bit on some of these newer cards
and it's also probably not worth buying
some of those mid-range cards still
although I did manage to find a deal
here on a gtx 960 for a hundred and
forty-eight dollars which is pretty damn
good value for money coming in the used
parts there in amazon so i'll put all
the links in the description below for
you guys if you wish to check them out
