Suite for Computex 2019.
This is the VIP showroom
at a different location,
so naturally, one would expect
to see some VIP products
and that's what we've got right here.
The Gigabyte Aero 15 OLED.
This has a Samsung 4k AMOLED
display inside running at 60Hz.
Naturally, my curiosity
is sparked since I do have
a 1,000 FPS camera, I am able to run that
and not only tell you
guys the response times
of the actual monitor itself,
but also the input latency.
Since this monitor is
designed for creators,
it isn't really pitched for gamers,
it's still important
to have those features.
Me personally as a gamer,
I like to double down
and use my computer for
video editing or vice versa
and I know a lot of people
do, so let's quickly run
those tests for you guys since
I am on the showroom floor
here and then we will report
back with the numbers in text
and let you know if that's good or not.
(upbeat music)
In terms of the specs, we're
looking at ninth gen i7's
and I'm told that an i9
variant will come of this.
This is to be released at the end of June
and it will feature an
RTX 2060 as well as 2070
or 2080 or a 1660 TI if you want to go in
with the entry level choice.
As for the bezel, it's
three millimeters thin,
so very thin option and it
does carry wifi 6 compatibility
as well as having all your
standard thunderbolt support,
USB 3.0 and also a UHS SD
card reader for someone
who actually wants to create,
so that content creator
label is starting to
fit the bill very well.
With an OLED screen versus
an ITS or a TN panel,
the colors are going
to come out so vibrant
on this particular PC.
On top of that, they've also
got two models in the making,
a gloss finish and a matte finish.
Me personally, I've always
been a fan since the beginning
of monitors of the gloss finish.
There is the semi-gloss
finish, which is somewhere
in between, but you
guys have to let us know
in the comments section
below, are you digging
the matte finish or the gloss finish?
I know a lot of people tend
to slide towards the matte,
but me personally I do
love the gloss finish
as it does let those colors,
and especially with OLED,
the colors shine through more vibrantly.
Also calling down a laptop of
94 watt TDP is very important.
They've got seven
intakes and four outtakes
with five heat pipes designed
over two fans with 71 blades.
All this is coming in under two kilograms
and 20 millimeters in total
height with Nahimic 3D audio
and I'm told the battery
life is pretty good too,
supporting up to 5.5 hours of usage,
of course depending on how you use it.
Moving forward a notch
here, we've got the model
that's designed for both
gamers and creators,
so that means a different screen.
A 1080p 144Hz IPS panel or
a sharp IGZO 240Hz display.
I do have the 1,000 FPS
camera, so what we're going
to do is quickly roll
those tests and report back
to you guys with the numbers.
(upbeat music)
Basically to my eyes, the
240Hz display was a lot clearer
and I do 100% with confidence
say that the numbers
from the 1,000 FPS camera will show that.
As for the input lag, that's
going to be pretty interesting
to see too, but I do
believe again, a 240Hz panel
with pretty much the same
hardware inside should show
a difference in favor of the 240Hz panel.
As for the specs, the classic
does step it down in going
from 4k to 1080p, but it does carry
those faster refresh rates,
but naturally it is coming in
with a lower price point, it
is already released to market.
You do get an RTX 2060,
2070, or 2080 and a choice
of those flavors, but of
course as you step it up
from a 2060 to a 2080 for example,
it will set you back more money.
The TDP rating is pretty much
the same as the OLED display,
but another thing Ontoktu
mentioned is that the battery life
is also good, but they
are taking away the wifi 6
and it does have wifi 5
on this particular model.
The differences between
the killer NIC's as well.
You're going from a 2500 to
a 2600 on the OLED display
and in terms of the color
graded displays themselves,
XRite is already on
top of that, so as soon
as you get this laptop, it is
ready to start editing photos
or video because it has been color graded.
These are those same ones
that I use in the studio
when I'm doing monitor reviews
to test if the displays
are good from the get-go, so
these have it automatically
certified out of the box.
In terms of pricing, you
can expect these things
to be pretty expensive,
especially the OLED displays.
I am told if you are in
Australia, it's going to cost
in excess of $3,000 for
one of these laptops,
but with that aside guys, let
us know in the description
below what you think of
the 1,000 FPS testing here
on the floor at Computex and
also do you prefer the matte
or gloss finish, love reading
your thoughts and opinions
as always and with that
aside, I'll catch you
in another tech video very
soon, but if you're enjoying
this coverage then be sure
to hit that like button
and hit that sub button, ring the bell.
If you want to see the
videos the moment they drop
and the lights have turned
out here, it is 6:00PM.
I've got to get out of there.
I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon.
Peace out for now, bye.
