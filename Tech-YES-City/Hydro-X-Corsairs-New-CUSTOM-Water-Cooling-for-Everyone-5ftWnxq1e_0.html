Here we are at Corsair's booth,
and they have also acquired
Elgato if you guys didn't know.
So, with that, they can now
improve the Elgato products
just as much as the Corsair
products have been innovating
and all that goodness, but right here,
they've got a streaming service.
Now, you've seen the stream deck,
so going from six buttons to 15 buttons,
and now to 32 buttons,
which was recently released on the market.
That coming in at around 250 USD,
and it's going to be
released in Australia soon,
but right here they've
got the service now.
So if you can't afford the stream deck,
then they have a subscription service
where the the first three
days is free to trial out.
If you like it, you can then subscribe
for three dollars a month
or 25 dollars a year.
And of course, with those costs,
it's a lot cheaper than
the stream deck itself,
and then you can install it on a tablet,
currently Apple iOS only, but
they are hearing feedback,
and people are loving it
to the point where they may introduce it
to Android very soon.
Besides the stream deck mobile service,
what is going on here
at the Corsair booth?
Let's find out.
(upbeat music)
And here is the main product coming out
from Corsair at Computex 2019.
I'm joined by Ross.
How you doing man?
- [Ross] I'm good, man, thanks, Bryan.
- [Bryan] Yeah, so, Ross
is an Aussie as well,
which makes things even better.
Just going through the booth, relaxed,
checking out all the products,
and right beside us, we
have these new HydroX,
pretty much a whole lineup
of new products, right,
where I believe starting
off with the GPU blocks,
they're covering all the RTX cards
as well as covering Vega 56
and 64, and on top of that,
you've got AM4 support, TR4 support,
Z390 on intel side, as well as X299.
But tell us a little bit
more about these coolers
and what makes them so special,
especially in terms of the
pump and reservoir for example.
- Yeah, so we're really
proud of all the stuff
that we're bringing to market with HydroX.
We're covering all of the
most popular graphics cards
and sockets, and on top of that,
we're bringing art,
Corsair style and flair.
We got RGB goodness.
It's all controlled with our IQ software,
so for example, with these GPU blocks,
you can see they've got awesome RGB
just lighting up the whole thing
that you can see throughout it.
It's got these beautiful
flow indicators as well,
so you can watch that fluid
in your coolant moving through it
to make sure that your
pump's working properly,
and on the note of that pump,
here with the XD5 pump res combo,
we've decided to go with the D5 pump
because it's fantastic reliability,
it's really popular, and
it has a great reputation,
and we've kind of adapted it
and put it into this reservoir pump combo.
And the advantage that
we have as well is that,
with our integrated IQ software,
you can monitor your cooling temperatures,
the temperature of the liquid
that's going through the loop,
and you can adjust fan curves, pump speed,
all that kinda stuff
automatically through IQ
in accordance with the kind
of performance you want
and how hot you want your coolant to be.
- [Bryan] So it's pretty much top down
everything's custom,
its got the RGB bling,
but we'll move over now
to the other computer
where they've actually got
the configurator service too,
so you can pretty much plan out a whole
custom water loop before you
even purchase anything right?
- [Ross] Yeah, so, with our
new Corsair configurator
we've actually got this
service that's available
on our website where you can put in
what gear you have, what case you have,
input your graphics card,
what motherboard you have
and we'll give you a
recommendation on which parts
that you can buy from our HydroX line up.
So here, you can see we've got
the RTX 2080 Ti founders block,
and you just put that in.
You just say which parts
that you're looking for
and it helps configure where
you can put your radiators,
where you can put the reservoir,
what fans you can use,
so it's a really useful
tool that you can use
to help plan your HydroX
build and once it's done
you can find a place, and it'll just say
find me a retailer and
you can print out a PDF
and you can find where
it's being sold near you,
and you can take them that PDF and they'll
sell you all those parts.
- [Bryan] And if you're in Australia the
retailers that will stock the HydroX parts
will be coming from
quarter three and they're
Mwave and also Scorptec.
Going through the most important parts
in this build you can
essentially put together
a soft tubing or a hard tubing loop,
but in terms of the radiators, they've got
120 up to 360 but then they've got,
in different lines, 140 all the way up to
the magical number 420.
But on top of that if you
need even more cooling
in a push and pull configuration,
then they've got the XR7 480 mil,
this is essentially what
you'd know as a dual slot,
coming in with 50 mil
thickness and they've also got
a 360 mil version of this
so, they have everything
covered in terms of the
pumps, the radiators,
and the blocks.
They've got the XC7 RGB, the XC9,
and then for the skews
on the GPU water blocks,
as we said before,
we've got Vega 56 and 64
being covered but these
are on the XG7 RGB block
logo and they'll have the
20 series for the RTX cards.
But with the CPU blocks they are going
with backwards support
for 2066 on X79 and X99
but I'm told that maybe
X58 is out of the question
but not to worry,
I'm definitely going to be
testing that for you guys
and seeing if I can jerry rig something
but in the meantime
they've also got coolants
coming to the market
as well, the XL5 stuff.
I'm told this is really good, long lasting
and you also won't have to
worry about cleaning out
your loop as much as you should I guess,
because in some loops you
have to clean them out
every three to six months,
I'm told these will be
lasting about 12 months
really before you have
to worry about cleaning them.
So, that's a really
good thing if your into
custom water loop, especially
if it's your first loop.
So they've got the coolant coming,
they've got the soft tubing,
they've got the hard tubing,
and in terms of that tubing they've got
12 and 14 mil thickness
as well as offering
all their own custom fittings.
So, Corsair have custom water cooling
down pat in 2019.
I look forward to giving you guys a custom
water cooled rig on the channel over at
Tech YES City when I
get back from Computex.
And with that aside I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon.
If you are digging this and what Corsairs
got on display here be sure
to hit that like button,
also let us know in the
comments section below
what you think of this whole new product
range from Corsair.
Love reading your thoughts
and opinions as always.
And I'll catch you guys in the next one,
peace out for now, bye.
