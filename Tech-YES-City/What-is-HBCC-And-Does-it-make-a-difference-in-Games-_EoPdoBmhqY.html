gravis cards they released a technology
called HB CC or high bandwidth cache
controller now this is a portion of the
GPU that's dedicated to using extra
memory once the already a gigabytes vram
buffer has been used up in games also md
claims that it does make a big
performance difference when the
conditions are right so today we're
gonna make sure that the conditions are
right I'm also going to look at minimum
frame rates both in the 1% forms and
also minimum fps and see if it does
indeed make a difference to your gaming
experience
welcome back to tech yes it is Brad
coming to you guys today with the look
at h bcc which is a technology that was
touted at the start of 2017 and now that
vega has been released it is a
technology that's included and you can
enable this in the global Whatman
software feature where will it currently
use additional system memory and
allocate that is vram however the
problem is at the moment is 8 gigabytes
on vega is actually enough for how
powerful the card is and so we'll see
this with some of the testing we've got
up here the first test was Deus Ex
mankind divided where I did max us out
of 4k and I did up the anti aliasing to
the point where we were maxing out the 8
gigabytes of vram buffer on board now
the problem here was the performance was
abysmal when we went to these levels so
in other words the rest of the hardware
besides the a gigabytes of vram was not
able to be utilized properly and this
led to a very low performance figure of
around 5 average FPS and now the
minimums did go to around 4.3 fps
however the one-percent lows were a
little bit lower than that at around 3.8
fps so it was very hard to sort of get
any usable experience out of this
however we decided to then turn on HBC C
and now there's two different settings
well there's actually a lot of different
settings but you can set how much of
your system memory you want dedicated to
the HPCC controller in this case we
decided to test the both 11.6 gigabytes
and also the maximum of 32 gigabytes
since I had 32 gigabytes of system
memory installed and when we did both
scenarios it actually scored worse than
the original figures that we were
getting what we saw here was the max
frame buffer was now going over 8
gigabytes however the performance was
even worse with an average of 5.9 FPS so
the average was very and slightly higher
however the minimums on the first time
around went down to 2.2 with a 1% low of
1.9 and then we had the second time
around again average of 5.9 FPS with a
minimum of 1.1 and 1% low of 1 FPS so
the numbers really were nothing
groundbreaking this technology was
simply not doing any work in this game
whatsoever when it came to actually
bettering the experience because the
experience was already so bad to begin
with
however after I did this I decided to
test some different games and first up
we had Far Cry primal and across the
results it was really much spread out
the same this technology on at low or
then on a high or then even off it
didn't make a difference to your average
or even 1% lows Tom Clancy's the
division was a very similar scenario and
moving on to an old favorite crisis
which is a very intensive game 1440p
when we had playable frame rates nothing
was changing and of course the last game
that I decided to test was battlefield
one so across all these different games
I couldn't find any differences really
in the 1% lows and also the average FPS
so HPCC as it stands for gaming doesn't
really do much on the vague or
architecture however with all that said
one area where I feel HB CC could make a
huge difference is on the lower end
cards for instance we recently tested
the HD 69 50 which is a non grata scope
but it only comes with one gigabyte a
frame buffer available now when we
tested that in pub gee that's player's
unknowns battlegrounds we saw that that
frame buffer really was limiting the
graphics card to the point where you
were getting a very undesirable
unplayable experience and so something
like this if it could allocate an extra
one gigabyte or two gigabytes of system
memory to the actual game itself I
believe you could get a smooth playable
experience at least at 720p low so I
believe technology like this is very
useful I just feel like in the gaming
sense it's not useful on a card that
already has a gigabytes of frame buffer
available especially when the games
nowadays are optimized for a certain
level of vram and so a gigabytes is more
than enough especially at 1440p if we go
up to 4k maybe that's when the card like
the Vega 56 is a key but it's a frame
buffer becomes more useful however that
being said you still have to have the
other specs available on the graphics
card if you don't have enough stream
processors or you don't have enough RAW
processing power itself you will again
have an undesirable unplayable
experience as we saw in the case of Deus
Ex mankind divided when we started
upping all those settings the frame
buffer was being stressed we were
getting like 5 FPS so it just wasn't
practical at all and although we
couldn't find a proper using gaming and
in fact it was
looking like it was actually a detriment
to performance I believe in the
professional workflow you may have uses
for this I have heard of AMD having the
ability to add in an SSD and using that
as a dedicated vram buffer which could
spell really good for certain
applications that could utilize that
extra frame buffer anyway guys I hope
you enjoyed today's video if you did
then be sure to hit that like button and
let me know in the comment section below
what you think of HB CC if you have any
extra tests you'd like me to do to
really stress this technology and see if
it makes a difference for the average
gamer but what I could find here today
really wasn't anything compelling and in
fact I thought that this technology
could be really useful with older school
graphics cards where the games are
optimized for say 2 gigabytes of frame
buffer but you only have one gigabyte
available on the card itself anyway I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
