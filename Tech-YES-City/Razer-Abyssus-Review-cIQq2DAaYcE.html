doing a review on the razer abyssus here
it is so we'll get the boring card done
quickly the box just a standard box
there it is your box this is a Chinese
one I got off ebay so the warrant is
actually voids probably going to return
so need warranty oh yeah the box is the
box comes with your manual your mouth
inside got your manual and you want your
card it's another crap but who cares
about the box so it's pretty lion just a
standard box let's have a look at the
mouse here it is guys here's the razer
abyssus so if we have a look at that
here it is so basically it looks good I
mean it it's a good-looking mouse the
light is I mean I'm not a person who
likes fancy lights or anything but this
lights kind of a its pleasant you know
it's good to good to have it lets you
know your mouse is working and it's not
bad so yeah kudos to razor me it's a
basically a no frills good-looking mouse
so that's that's a good point that's the
first good point about this mouse second
good point is that it feels great for
the claw grip so if you're playing RTS
games like starcraft 2 it it really
really gets on you know you can you know
really gets well gets along well with
your hand in so if you measure my hands
so I did a review on the g3 as well
measure my hand 20 centimeters and my
finger middle finger is about nine
centimeters so the mouse dimensions are
on the razor website but that's a first
good point is it looks good yep and the
second really good point is it does feel
good if you put your
in there it feels great like hear the
click is good like you sync your fingers
really grip the mouse well but that's as
far as this mouse goes in terms of good
points because the cord is very I don't
know I think it's very weak and little I
mean I could I mean I I don't really
care because on I'm not really taking
this mouse anywhere but if you'll take
to learn events or if you had animals in
the house this any scored could easily
get ripped or busted by the cat's teeth
or something you know but another the
second bad point about this mouse is I
mean it's so light I mean I pick it up
it's like it is the lightest mouse I've
ever held it is just so light like I
move it around it it is just light and
see for me I think that's a little bit
of a bad point because I mean here's my
hand it just feels like I'm moving air
you know like it doesn't even feel like
I'm holding a mouse you know so I kind
of I'd prefer if raise it did put a bit
of weight in this mouse maybe you know
cuz i did way I did way it on my scales
and it came to about sixty six grams it
is a light little boy this mess and um I
guess the another bad point about it is
the clicking is the clicking itself when
you click the buttons it kind of feels
like a cushy click like if you're
clicking the buttons they kind of feel
like a cushy click here I'm not I can't
say I'm not probably not not much of a
fan of it so yeah I preferred I guess
Logitech's click or Microsoft's click as
opposed to razors click so
that's um that's about it for this mouse
but I guess the last thing is the I
guess you hold it and it kind of I don't
know like if the the build quality is
good but kind of feels a bit cheap i
guess like you can see where razor makes
their money out of this mouse i mean it
just kind of feels like it's cheap so i
don't know but yeah the i mean it's got
what you need if you're definitely
looking for an upgrade it is good it is
a good mouse i would i would recommend
it but i'd probably say for me the g3 is
better than the razor and so i'll do
another review after this comparing the
razor and the g3 but basically yeah if
they added a bit more weight to this
mouse it'd be really good if I think
that's the biggest thing is it's just
too light so um yeah that's about it
guys so I can't think of anything else
to say it's it's a good Mouse it's but
it's just too light so I don't think um
I I mean yeah you know those buttons
don't come with the mouse anyway these
are the two buttons so I mean people are
complaining about not having the the
back and forward buttons on the sides
there's diddy it's because razor clearly
does state that it doesn't have those
buttons before you even buy it and for
RT yes I mean I don't mind the you know
the DPI switching on the bottom here
it's not a problem because I mean I've
never changed the DPI on the fly anyway
and the polling you had always wanted it
a thousand Hertz anyway because it's the
best milli second one millisecond
response time you know so alright guys I
check out my g3 review and I'm going to
make another review now about g 3 verse
the abyssus peace out guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
