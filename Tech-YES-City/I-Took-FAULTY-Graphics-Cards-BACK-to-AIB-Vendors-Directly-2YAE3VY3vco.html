Taipei and this is the beautiful city of
Computex we will be filming that a
little bit later but today we're gonna
be taking a look at how to fix your
graphics card if you are in this magical
city now behind me is gigabyte and horas
and also behind them is msi now I just
happen to have three faulty graphics
cards on hand that is a gtx 1050 TI a
gtx 960 and also a gtx 1070 but i'm told
the best thing about these places is is
if that they don't fix your card then
you have to pay no fee at all so they're
automatically talking my language
and yes i did get a little bit of sleep
so that means there is going to be a lot
more used price-performance content
coming to your sub box before Computex
actually begins with that aside let's
check out the faulty pouch of hardware
and then see what's wrong with it or
what I think is wrong with it and then
go in and try and get it repaired and
then after that we're also gonna try and
get some other electronics that I have
on hand either replaced or repaired as
well
so here's the three cards here the first
one is a gigabyte gtx 750ti
now this just gives out no signal at all
so I'm very curious to see if they can
fix the I guess the number one common
problem of the faulty GPU and that is
just everything looks fine nothing's
gone up in smoke but it just doesn't
give out a signal at all sometimes this
can happen where the fan just spins up
fully from when you start the PC or
sometimes it can look like it's
operating normally but again no signal
then beside that we've got a card with
the exact same problem this is the MSI
GTX 960 and then beside that this one
here I do believe they can fix this
easily because what happened was I got
this from a client who returned a PC and
it had a backplate on him when I took
that back plate off it had two of the
SMD s on the back were burnt off so
that's probably an easy fix I'm hoping
at the very least they can fix this
since it is a gtx 1060 and apparently
they only charge 40 US dollars to fix
these graphics cards if they manage to
fix them so we're gonna go inside the
stores which are literally just two
steps away and see what they say so
they're not gonna fix the msi car
then the they need a telephone number
but you only have an Aussie number so
they're asking what happened with this
card and I just told them spool but uh
and if you guys remember from the last
pots on ma Co he helped us out because
he can speak the language healed and so
he's sort of doing a bit of translation
so apparently it's seven business days
so that's why I got in really early with
this because again this vlog will sort
of conclude if I just get enough time to
get these cards back before I go back to
Australia that's why I budgeted the time
and I said like this is probably cool we
got these graphs guys fixed if we can
now the good thing is is that these cars
apparently are still under warranty even
though I don't have the receipts the
official Support Centre here will fix
them for free which is absolutely
awesome considering everything else so
if this does go through I'll be over the
moon now this one here spawn this one
here no it's just a little cool it's got
my info instead okay yeah just sign yep
just sign there yep sign your life away
okay while you're filming it coming yes
they really cool they can they said I
could film in here guys so don't worry I
know there's some people in the comments
like you shouldn't put a camera in their
face it's like I asked him first
but we know the trigger people we just
put a camera in her face and we just got
out of the Gigabyte service center and
that was really good news because
hopefully both those gravis cars will
come back fixed and they won't cost me
anything at all that's hoping fingers
crossed but it's simply right next door
with the MSI's door let's just go in
there and see if they can fix that gtx
960 that's what we need to get a number
okay so we just got out of the msi
repair center and they were going to
charge twenty seven US dollars to fix up
that gtx 960 but one thing about that
was they were really reluctant to accept
the graphics card because it wasn't
bought with in taiwan and another thing
i've learned from this is that if you
don't have someone that speaks chinese
then you're going to have very little
chance of getting your parts are made or
fixed so especially in the case of the
msi store like they did not speak one
word of English and I'm lucky I had
Markoff you guys don't remember Marko
was featured last year and Computex used
paths on he basically speaks fluent
Chinese and so it was really good having
him around except he's a little bit shy
to appear on camera this time around due
to all the positive comments he got in
the last year's parts hunt but to tell
you that up with those three grabs cards
we've got two gigabyte cards though
looking like they'll get fixed for free
if they manage to come back in time and
then the GTX 960 from MSI that hopefully
will get fixed if it doesn't it's no
cost if it does it's $27 but you're
probably wondering where I am at the
moment I'm in a very big district
popular electronics store in Taiwan
called the Guang hua electronics
district and here's where I'm going to
try and get some repairs on my
microphone besides that I'm
also gonna try and get some faulty pots
which I don't have receipts for or
anything like that just like the grabby
Scots I'm gonna take them to the
manufacturers here and especially in the
case of faulty RAM I'm going to see if
they do adhere to that lifetime warranty
that we always hear about when you buy
some of these pots without a side let's
get rolling exactly right this second
right kick and he's quick
yeah he's quick so last year I came to
this exact store and they fixed me up
with a custom cable for recording for
combi Jack's it's actually a life saver
so I knew straight away to come back
here again
now what we've got here is an old 1980s
vintage Japanese broadcaster mic now I
picked this up on a deals hunt quite a
while ago but you guys been complaining
about the gold Mike saying you don't
like it and it's time for a change and I
think it's time for a very so I think I
got this one for about ten dollars but
the thing is on the used market they go
for over $150 I believe so I'm not too
sure but I have tested out the vocal
properties with an adapter already and
it does sound pretty damn good as well
as having good noise rejection does take
a double-a battery as well underneath
that and is required to get that to work
on my standard cameras whether it be a
DSR or the one that I'm using now which
is just the standard vlog cam and here's
the original jack so this is a quarter
inch Jack and we're gonna not only
shorten the cable but we're also going
to change that over to a 3.5 millimeter
that will natively plug into my camera
right now and you can see here just
on-the-fly the service is so good
they're pretty much just sold during on
the new ends and like I said just
earlier before last time I got a cable
here it was it's just been rock-solid it
last was so long and they just do a
really good job of making everything
work and of course it doesn't break the
bank at all so awesome and of course if
you guys have followed me for a while
you know that I can't solder for Jack so
this is going to solve one problem very
quickly and we'll give it a quick test
as well testing one two this is the new
broadcaster mic for Computex and I
believe it is working because the volume
bars on the camera
moving and we are getting signal on both
the left and the right also quickly let
us know in the comment section below are
you enjoying this vlog and are you
enjoying the new vintage 1980s
microphone
so we're now back in Australia and I
tested out these three graphics cards
that I got fixed up and the 1050 Ti it
works absolutely fine but one
interesting thing about this card is
that it says m9 bad on the card itself
so I'm not sure what that means if
someone out there in the audience knows
what m9 bad means I'd actually love to
know another cool thing about this card
was when I was at the repair center they
had this actually giving out a signal
initially and when I first saw it I was
like no way because before I do deem a
card faulty or bad I do test it out in a
variety of situations and just when I
was there I said to them
can you please run a benchmark on this
gtx 10:50 TI and so they started up
heaven and it wouldn't even boot and
this and then the car just crashed out
and then after that it wouldn't give out
a signal at all so then they said okay
we've got to repair this thing and ship
it off and then it came back about five
days later saying with the gtx 1070 but
in the case of the 1070 they didn't even
fix it up they just gave me a whole new
card and it had a new backplate on it
because I didn't bring the back plate
with me because I thought it wasn't
needed and so there must have been more
to that card than meets the eye because
I thought it was just to faulty
resistors on the back but obviously
there might have been a bit more wrong
with the car because they just replaced
it entirely and that card 2 is now on
the test bench it's working a hundred
percent it's all good to go and I did
take off the plastic wrapping after
everything worked just for those people
who got OCD about it and then last up
here we had the GTX 960 and this came
back all ok as well just like the other
two cards but MSI also replaced the
faulty fan blade I wasn't really faulty
it was just missing a fin and they
replaced that entirely and the funny
thing about these fan blades is that
they do cost a bit on the new market so
what's good to see that they not only
fix the card but they also replaced the
fan blade for 25 US dollars roughly I
think it was about 800 NT dollars so
I'll quickly put the transfer prices up
here for you guys you get an idea of how
much it cost but overall we had three
faulty cards that came in and three
cards that are pretty much brand new
come
out and that's a really good thing
because it gives sort of an option for
people on what to do with their faulty
cards instead of sticking them in the
oven which I know a lot of us have tried
in the past and pretty much the hit rate
on that is really pretty low in my
experience so you can get them to come
back to life that in a lot of cases I
think there's more to a faulty graphics
card than just the GPU dye itself in a
lot of the cases in times of m9 I'm not
sure that means and in the case of this
MSI board I'm pretty sure they did not
replace the GPU die I'm pretty sure it
was something else on the card that was
faulty and so really hit home with me
when these cards are made in Taiwan and
it makes sense if you've got a faulty
card to then go get it fixed in Taiwan
because I think if you're in America
Australia or UK for example when you go
to a repair centre there they sometimes
ship it all the way back to Taiwan
anyway and it gets repaired there and
then shipped back to you and of course
the transit times can be pretty bad and
in case of the card if it's actually out
of warranty then they'll probably charge
you a lot more as they otherwise would
have charged you if you were in Taiwan
in the case of fixing the GTX 960 $25 is
actually a pretty good price gtx 750ti
and also gtx 1070 getting fixed for free
is needless to say one of the best
bargains of my life considering I picked
these up on the used market in the case
of the 1050 TI I thought I got hosed by
gigabyte and the service made it so I
didn't get hosed and I got a really good
deal in the end and in the case of that
1070 that was a faulty card that came
back I've already replaced it for the
person who bought a PC of me but
ultimately it's a really good experience
I know my expressions on my face and the
way I'm talking probably isn't as
excited as I should be but that's
because I just got back from Computex
and that was just nine days of straight
full-on burnout maybe if you see a
faulty card and especially if it's
something like a GTX 10 series card or a
new Radeon card or something like that
and it says faulty and is going for
really cheap then you can pick that up
and if you're in Taiwan or in that area
then those service centres are really
good to deal with though I will state in
the case of MSI I did have Marco there
and it did speak Chinese and I think if
he didn't speak
they wouldn't have taken the turn in and
they wouldn't have repaired the card so
that is something to come out of that so
if you do go to Taiwan make sure you've
got a friend who's local and who can
take you to the service center and just
organise the RMA and get the card fixed
as tase's gigabyte service that was
really top-notch it was a different
experience and they didn't know who I
was when I walked in there they were
just really friendly and they like
really receptive and helped me out and
said okay these cards are actually still
under warranty technically and we'll fix
him for free for you and I was like wow
that's really cool service so the case
of gigabyte was awesome I think he could
have got away if you didn't speak
Chinese but in the case of the msi
service center you definitely want
someone there who can speak the local
language but also in regards to the
other faulty parts i had with the faulty
memory the faulty SSD and stuff like
that i just did not get time to go to
those service centers and initiate the
RMA as I ran out of time during Computex
so I would have loved to have updated
you guys on that but keep in mind I do
believe the service for repairing parts
in Taiwan is actually really good at
least what came out of these graphics
cards here because these are more
expensive units than memory so I
imagined they wouldn't have a problem
repairing SSDs and things like memory as
well but you guys that's it for today
and repairing GPUs in Taiwan massive
success if you guys have any stories of
your own about repairing pots or you got
any questions

peace out for now but
