32 inch 4k monitor that is aimed at
professionals however the everywhere I
turn there seems to be this stigma going
on that this monitor is not for gamers
and I'm disagreeing with that because
I'm here to tell you that this monitor
is phenomenal for gaming when I put this
thing through a thousand FPS testing and
yes I can now test it a thousand FPS I
figured out the settings on my beautiful
4k camera I was blown away this thing
was giving me input lag of like sub
twenty milliseconds from the mouse click
to the total time it took the actual
screen to change in csgo and as you can
see in this video by the time my finger
from slamming it so hard is bouncing up
off the mouse this thing is giving out a
response
absolutely phenomenal low input lag so
it does have three input lag levels and
this is on the ultra fast setting which
I recommend everyone keep on and it's on
by default by the way now with response
times as well you're probably thinking
this is an IPS panel and it has ghosting
and yes it does exhibit a little bit of
ghosting but it isn't bad if you set
this to the fastest ultra fast response
time I found the ghosting was actually
quite decent especially for a beautiful
IPS panel like this however of course
the downside is it doesn't feature any
variable refresh rate technology like
freesync or g-sync but if you guys have
followed me for a while you'll know that
I prefer in sync I mean no sync
welcome back to tech yes it is brian
coming to you guys today with the review
and as I said the intro this thing it
can do gaming absolutely fine however it
is geared up towards professional use
when I tested this with the ex rack
controller here it gave out phenomenal
results of course the monitor to the
left here being calibrated by ex right
professional tools themselves I found
there was virtually no difference when I
tried to do the tests with the I wan
display Pro so everything on this
monitor out of the box with the srgb
profile is ready to go so if you're a
professional video editor or if you're a
professional photographer and you need
color accuracy then this thing out of
the box will give you just that however
one thing I will critique is that the
brightness out of the factory is set to
a hundred it is practically too bright
for anyone for any professional use out
of the box I found I was getting over
three hundred thirty CCD of brightness
and honestly I had to back it down to
around about fifty which then gave me
around 180 CCD so this is where I like
to use it personally
it isn't really in that professional
field of 80 to 120 though of course if
you want that field that you can drop it
down to 30 and it will give you those
levels you so desire if you need them
also further on the note of color
calibration not only is every individual
monitor calibrated out of the factory
with the 32 68 4k but you also get an
individual report as well so not only is
it properly calibrated out of factory
but it's also quality checked as well
and look at the surface of the monitor
itself it features a matte anti-glare
coating it's a 3h rating honestly
sunlight will not be a problem with this
monitor if you use it in an environment
like mine at the moment where I've got
no blinds to control light then this
monitor is great for still getting a
very clear picture as opposed to a gloss
panel which although looks great in
complete darkness in the sunlight it
does suffer this thing here even though
it's got that matte coating still gives
through a beautiful picture as well so
they've used an excellent anti-glare
coating on this monitor
however the uniformity of the luminance
was lit across the panel very evenly
near perfect and the backlight bleeding
was very minimal and cross-hatching as
well when i pulled up an orange
background I saw no there's a
cross-hatching as well so this is 60
Hertz 4k now the display ports you've
got to one mini and also one full-sized
1.2 display ends and also two HDMI 2.0
ends as well there's also four USB three
outs which can connect to your computer
via USB B and give you those four ports
that you can use if you need them now
besides the four display ins and four
USB outs it also has a line out and
audio out Jack as well so you can use it
with headphones plug in direct to the
monitor if cable management's a problem
or also give a line out to a separate
receiver there is also as well built-in
speakers that surprisingly didn't sound
too half bad I mean you could use these
speakers for clutch video editing
especially for smartphones and still get
decent results of course the bass isn't
there how not having a subwoofer but the
sound was actually quite surprisingly
good however what else does the
ViewSonic 3268 4k give you well the
included stand is quite simply the best
stand I've seen in my life to date it's
actually replacing my 21 by 9 Samsung
monitor which is phenomenal for gaming
but when it comes to 4k video editing I
think I need a 4k monitor which I used
before the 21 by 9 Samsung so this
monitor here the stand will go 90
degrees pivot it'll go 120 degrees
swivel it also is able to be adjusted
height wise from 510 mil from the top of
the monitor up to 640 ml so a 130 mil of
height adjustment with this monitor is
included now the finish on the stand is
a matte finish with a slight bit of
gloss with the viewsonic label very
subtle look is very clean and then the
monitor itself has a matte finish with a
near bezel list design it's about half
an inch and so when I measured it you do
get 31 and a half inches of viewable
display so they are telling you on the
box and you are getting exactly just
that of course the monitor being 32
inches from the end of the bezel
diagonally to the other end of the bezel
though further going into this monitor
of course it's 4k IPS is not VA is not
TN the included stand is phenomenal the
design is very clean though what is
wrong with this monitor is there
anything that's wrong with this monitor
well honestly the one thing that I don't
like is the on-screen display it's got
five buttons on the back and I found it
a little bit tedious to control
especially coming from the Samsung 21 by
nine which only has one button with four
directions I'd like to see viewsonic
changes in the future because this is
obviously changing from five buttons to
one button and it makes things very easy
to use I had a bit of a tough time using
the on-screen display but there were so
many different options on this monitor
to choose from so basically you could go
in change response times change the
input lag you also had picture in
picture mode and the ability to split
the monitor into different sections
there's HDR 10 supported as well and
there's also the ability for overscan
and of course contrast and brightness
control and you can change the profiles
to many different professional settings
of course out of the box as I said
before comes with the srgb format but
there's a lot of different formats to
choose from so I didn't really like the
OSD a whole lot but to be honest once
you set everything up it's not going to
be such a problem as you do have your
custom profile so if you want to set one
up for photo editing and then one for
watching movies then you can change that
on the fly with relative ease of course
are there any other catches with this
monitor well not a whole lot I mean the
panel itself is 8 bit plus frc so it's
not a true 10 bit display though
honestly if you guys want to step it up
to a 10 bit display you're looking at a
very expensive workflow not only just
with the monitor itself which will be
amplitudes more expensive than this
monitor but you've got to get the
graphics card and of course the whole
workflow to support that memory cards
the right camera with 10 bit support and
it will cost you a lot of money though
this monitor itself it comes in
currently at 1,300 Australian dollars or
if you in the US you can currently pick
it up on Amazon for around about 860 US
so what you're getting for the money out
of the box is something that comes color
calibrated and it has all the specs to
match what you would need out of a
professional-grade video editing monitor
or photo editing or print press monitor
if you so wish and here's where things
get a little bit weird because even
though this monitor as I said before is
geared up towards 4k professional work
it actually doubles down as a phenomenal
gaming monitor and your probably
thinking oh well color accuracy I'm not
too keen on color accuracy as a gamer I
want saturated colors let me tell you
guys this thing color accurate or not is
a phenomenal monitor for game
it's so sharp the colors do indeed pop
if you want them to so you just turn up
the brightness a little bit if you want
to start gaming and it's even got gaming
profiles locked in that'll give you that
saturated look if you so wish so it does
have all the perks of being a great
secondary gaming one low input lag great
response times for an IPS panel which on
the box are measured at 14 milliseconds
great are great you probably thinking oh
that's a horrible number especially when
10 is boasting 2 milliseconds of one
millisecond and the bottom line is some
manufacturers honestly state their
greater great response times and some
just buff it up according to one point
that they did in their tests via sonica
giving you guys an honest grader gray
response time and I really respect that
and honestly after looking at this
monitor I'm shocked I want to see what
their gaming monitors would be like
because to me this is what a gamer would
need low input lag great response times
if you Sonic have done a great job with
this monitor at aiming it towards
professionals but also having those
features there for gamers and I've got
myself now a new 4k video editing
monitor that is going to replace my
Samsung monitor and yes the Samsung
monitor will be sorely missed and I do
love that for gaming but the problem is
not all games support 21 by 9 and even
if they do they stretch the image out
and then of course when it comes to 4k
video editing this thing has more screen
real estate and a 4k screen capture has
never been easier perhaps I should make
a separate video with 21 by 9 ultra wide
versus 16 by 9 4k if you guys want to
see that let me know in the comment
section below and of course with this
being an IPS panel the viewing angles
are phenomenal birth on the horizontal
and vertical planes they beat that of
both a VA and a tan panel also with this
monitor itself there is no dead pixels
and I do believe viewsonic offer a very
solid warranty with this monitor for
three years in Australia and New Zealand
I'm not sure about other parts in the
world though there are these guys I hope
you enjoyed today's review this is the
32 inch 4k viewsonic monitor let me know
in the comments section below have you
tried a viewsonic monitor before if so
what was your experience like if not
would you like to try one this one to
the left of me although it's geared up
towards professionals and yes the cost
is a little bit expensive what you're
getting for the money is phenomenal if
you are in a
video editing for instance in the past
you guys have probably noticed some of
my edits have come out very weird on the
21 by 9 some people went as far as to
say that I looked like a lobster
on-screen and my friend came over and
showed me on his smartphone I was like
damn I do look like a lobster and when I
was editing on the 21 by 9 I was like
hey this looks all right looks pretty
saturated looks pretty good how do I
have this monitor edit that video there
would have been no lobsters coming out
on screen the only way back on point
this is my first view sonic monitor and
I'm already blown away by this thing I'm
looking forward to seeing what some of
their dedicated gaming monitors can do
and I'll give you guys a review of that
if one comes through and I'll catch you
guys in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye
now with the monitors surface itself
this is really good if you're working in
daylight or sunblock and I do believe
viewsonic offer a very solid wine or tea
with this monitor but there are these
guys there it is the viewsonic 32 inch
4k monitor oh yeah there it is the</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
