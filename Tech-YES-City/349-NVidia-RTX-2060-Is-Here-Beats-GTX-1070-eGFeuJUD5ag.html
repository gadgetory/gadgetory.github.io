to come this is invidious r-tx 2060
which is definitely making rounds out
there on the internet coming with a
price tag of three hundred and forty
nine dollars u.s. however what makes
this a special release compared to the
other r-tx cards because we know that
the RT x twenty ATT i came out with that
high price tag the RT x twenty eighty
one of those first released was kind of
not really offering a whole lot more
than the 1080 TI and then we had the
twenty seventy which I thought was the
better of the value propositions coming
out of the RT X models but now we have
what looks like finally a very solid
value for money choice for gamers either
at 1080p or 1440p suspec wise this grams
card has nineteen hundred and twenty
cuda cores it also has a stock boost
clock of 1680 megahertz that some people
have already reviewed it and they're
saying that's easily overclockable to
get a 2,000 megahertz stable boost clock
and at these levels
it is pretty much beating out of ten
seventy TI as well as offering those
r-tx features and dl SS support another
really cool thing about it is that
they've enabled now with the RT x 2060
at least is the ability to support free
sync monitors so if you've got those
budget choices at least compared to the
g-sync monitors you should now hopefully
be able to use your graphics card with
adaptive sync on that particular monitor
but with all that aside let's take a
look at how I think the RT X 2060 is
definitely going to shake up the market
welcome back to take your cities so late
last night NVIDIA had the press
conference where they announced not only
the 2060 but also our TX graphics cards
in laptops with their max Q design then
most notably being the RT X 2080 in a
really small form factor we'll be
covering that in some later videos with
the board partners specifically what
we're looking at now is really the 2060
which stole the show from Nvidia and
that is at its price point it is
offering some really compelling value
for money at least for people who want
that higher-end type of performance but
don't want to break the bank whole lot
so do through some of the benchmarks out
there already PC Gamer did a really good
article where they tested 17 games and
gave out an average and we see the 2060
is pulling well ahead of the 1070 which
once it's released into the market is
pretty much gonna make the 1070 at least
from a price performance standpoint on
new parts pretty much irrelevant the
1070 Ti is also pretty much neck and
neck with the 2060 and since it does
have those new features available will
be more power efficient as definitely
looking like the 2060 will indeed to
replace the 1070 TI as well and when you
overclock it it is good to see that
those numbers are getting a pretty
sizable boost over that of the 1080 to
even going neck-and-neck with that once
you overclock it so this is definitely a
powerful card certainly a lot more
powerful than what we're used to seeing
out of the 60 series branded GPUs from
Nvidia but also with this card to that
put GDR six on board as well as using
that over at 192 wide bit bus but also
on top of that with the founders edition
car so civically it's good to see that
if included a backplate and it does look
as stylish as the Big Brother
counterparts - now on top of that some
of probably the most exciting news at
least for me personally was now the
support where Nvidia is going to add a
driver level 2 now support essentially
free sync monitors so if you've got one
of those monitors that's a hundred Hertz
refresh 1440p ultra wide and it only has
free sync support then now there are TX
cards will be able to be utilized with
that adaptive sync technology so it's
going to be very interesting to see how
this plays out in the real world however
one thing to keep in mind is in the
notes themselves that not every single
monitor will be supported specifically
it does depend on the particular brand
and also make of that freesync
model and
support through the display port
connectivity so something things up with
the 2060 it's definitely looking like
it's the best value for money solution
from the 2000 series cards it's also got
that free sync support now as well as
having those features like DL SS support
and retracing with five gig arrays
versus the 2070 for example which has
six gig arrays so you'll be able to
utilize that since it is finally coming
into games as opposed to when the 2080
and 2080 GI were launched there was a
big thing about these technologies not
being supported in games yet so it looks
like this card is not only a sweet spot
in terms of price performance but also
in the time that it's being released to
the market with those supported
technologies but also closing out what
about the RT X 2050 on as well I have
heard some rumors that is definitely
ready to go - and the specs on that
looks like it will be even better value
for money than the 2060 so you have to
stay tuned for that I'm not sure when
they're going to release that but I do
know it's in the works as opposed to the
2060 and getting a rerun on the channel
I'll look after you guys when I get back
to Australia I'll be giving you a full
in-depth review of the scraps card so
make sure you stay tuned and if you
enjoyed today's video then be sure to
hit that like button and let us know in
the comments section below what you
think up the 2060 isn't the card you've
been waiting for I also have some rising
3000 series coverage whatever new they
get on that I'll be reporting to you so
make sure you stay subscribed and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
