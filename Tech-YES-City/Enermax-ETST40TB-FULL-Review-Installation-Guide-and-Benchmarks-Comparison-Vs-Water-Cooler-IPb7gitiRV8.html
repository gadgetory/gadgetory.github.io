Siddhas baronies coming back to you guys
today with an unboxing a full review of
the Animax t 40 so this is Anna Max's
budget CPU cooler and from a lot of
reviews that I've read it does an
extremely good job of cooling now since
this piece of crap here died as you guys
probably know I have been looking sort
of I'm probably gonna go back to air
cooling especially since in Japan I
cannot get custom parts it's so hard to
get custom water cooling parts here so
I'm figuring I'm gonna go with air
cooling I've kind of lost faith in a
stack there water pump died on me so
that was a shame and yeah it's kind of
hard to recommend you know 14 months
mean it's rated it have supposedly rated
a hundred thousand hours but I only got
about two thousand hours out of my
cooler before it died so that's pretty
sad now unboxing this product we can see
that straight away we get the mounting
brackets for both AMD and Intel you also
get the LGA 2011 bracket as well so
comes loaded with brackets you also get
in here thermal paste from Animax as
well so that's I really like that how
they're letting the user apply the
thermal paste themselves which I like I
like that better than these pre applied
thermal pads nowadays that you're
getting service like that from Animax
attention to detail now I'm boxing the
product itself you're getting actually I
was surprised this cooler is actually a
bit bigger than I thought it was it
comes extremely well packaged I mean I
like the fact that the the most
important part of the cooler which is
the contact area is actually boxed away
from the box as well so if there was
damage to the box it still wouldn't
touch the heatsink the direct the
contact area so that's really good
so unboxing that this is what you get
here this is the main product you guys
have come to see the Animax
240 there it is there in the flesh
really good looking product I like it it
looks amazing this here is the most
impressive feature is the direct contact
pipes there's four of these coming
through the base of the contact area now
the good thing to note is that they're
more towards the center of the area as
well which is really good I like that
because as you guys know the core but
below the heat spreader
actually based around here so it's going
to be pretty much direct touching those
heat pipes directly which is awesome now
the whole product itself feels really
well built it's feels actually pretty
damn sturdy I'm going to say straight
away
it comes with an Animax fan which
actually looks pretty damn impressive
too
that's what I think this fan looks
impressive the whole thing looks nice
and shiny and impressive it also comes
with a braided cable on the pwm fan
controller so it's also a four pin as
well so it'll read out the speeds as
well which is really good now the I will
say straight away though is I put my
nail over here there are little episode
tiny gaps between the heat pipe and the
base so you can feel that if you rub
your nail on there so that's something
that you know it can't be helped though
means a thirty dollar cooler I can't
nitpick it that much yeah that's what
you get that's the cooler itself I'm
gonna now install this I'm gonna get
some benchmarks for you guys and tell
you how the installation was as well and
if it was a breeze er if it was hard and
if it was hard I'll point out what
pacifically was hard about the
installation so let's get on with that
yes and another thing before we install
the cooler I want you guys to get an
alcohol wipe and take this sticker off
take this off here and I want you to
wipe this down before you do it because
the reason why is because even if it
comes out of the factory it's still
gonna have ever so slight amounts of
dust or you know just have a sticker on
it so it's gonna have some sort of
debris on there so I always before I
install stuff even if it does look
perfect I like to wipe it down with an
alcohol wipe I get all the debris off
there get all any crap I mean even
though there's not much there probably
still would be a little bit so I think a
lot of people fail to do this before
they install the cooler and it's just
one of those nitpick things that I do so
that you know you're welcome to do it
yeah so I'm doing this now just gonna
wipe this down for you guys and wipe
down for myself too and then a polish
rack so I got a polish rag just wipe it
down and there we go look at that even
more shinier than it was before which is
really good that's what we want so
awesome anyway let's get on to
installing this thing and see how well
it
okay here's a quick size comparison for
you guys here enter max T for T stop
intel heat sink fan I mean look at that
this thing is just that I mean it's like
I said it's bigger than I thought it was
so it's gonna do a lot better of a job
than this one today let's get on with it
it looks actually really easy for me
just getting into it now this bracket
here this is on an LGA 1150 even though
it doesn't say it's officially supports
it I think it will put this here in
there slide it underneath your
motherboard until the holes all line up
so just doing that now so it may take
some time but there we go got it there
is that all the holes I can see all the
holes there and just two corners you put
the washers down on top and just put
that in there like that
and screw it yeah I wish I had surgeon
hands I'll try the other corner yeah
just I mean this is this is my weeks
this is my weak spot so my Achilles heel
is installing nuts and bolts so just get
two of the corners in preferably
diagonals because that'll hold it in
properly and then you can take your hand
off the back plate and relax a little
bit so just like that so this is just
the first part of installation so a lot
of people buy a car you know how to
install these things I'm just here to
show you guys it's it's actually really
easy so the back this is actually
amazing this is actually really easy
easy so I will loosen that up a bit just
to make sure that it's perfect because
you don't want the holes touching the
corners because you know that'll take
away from I guess it could hit the PCB
and you know just perfectionist stuff if
you're doing an install do it properly
guys so sorry my hand is probably
blocking it a bit but you can see that
the installation is just a breeze really
easy on this so far
I'm just installing it now now me having
a flat base case actually
make the job a little bit easier so just
installing that now now just when you
screw the screws in again just make sure
they're firm so don't overdo it
don't whole kit because you could cross
thread stuff but at the same time make
sure the bolts are in pretty firmly like
that so that's that that's ready to go
for the next stage okay so the next part
is really easy you just put this down on
here just down on here like that and
just these bolts here install these ones
so doing doing like so so I must admit
it feels really like installation is a
breeze I like that Animax so far anyway
I mean it doesn't officially support an
LGA 1150 so you guys are wondering
what's the difference there actually is
a difference and that is that the chips
it's ever so slightly lower and
especially since I've D loaded my chip
as well it will slip sit a little bit
lower as well so you know keen to see if
it actually works fine I hope it will so
there that's the next part you just
fasten those down like that this is
gonna be the base for which your cooler
is going to sit on and that's the next
part done okay so the next part you want
to get kind of going to want to do is
put these thermal paste on the chip
which I've done there as you can see
that I put PK some prolimatech PK 3 this
is my stuff of choice PK 3 I'll put this
on the chip and you can see that's
looking good now another thing is also I
recommend taking off the fan off the
heatsink so that's going to make
installation easier as well okay now
we're ready for the next part so once
the fans off you just put it in here now
with LGA 1150 it's pretty damn tight as
you can see here the RAM so this is why
you should take the fan off because the
RAM will actually sit
pretty um yeah the fan will come over
the RAM so you want to take the fan off
install it and then put the fan on
now nothing the other thing to note is
they and this is pretty much touching
the N I see so pretty damn dangerous I
wanna like make sure that's there so put
that on there make sure it's sort of you
know I'm gonna make sure it's not
touching my ni C but it's pretty it's
pretty nerve-wracking so if you were on
a if you were on a micro ATX board
that's something to be careful of too so
that's pretty damn scary so that's why I
generally don't like micro ATX boards
but yeah it's just one of those things
you can also you also have the option of
turning it this way if you want to and
install it that way I'm just going to do
it the normal way show you guys now the
next part is to get this bracket and
just slide this in under here so again
my hands aren't the best for doing this
but just put that in there and yeah it
fits no problems like it fits absolutely
no problems on the LGA you know it fits
no problems on this LGA so I'm going to
move it a little bit up now just away
from my ni C and then I'm gonna use
these bolts to use these bolts here to
fasten it and put it on this way
so put that one on there and put this
one on here and that's about it that's
all there is to installation put the fan
back on and we're good to go
so we'll tighten that pretty tight
making sure it's away from my ni see ya
it looks it's looking good you know this
is looking really good at the moment
looking really good so that's it that's
all there is to it
that's the Animax installed guys okay so
you guys can see that it's 26 degrees in
here and I mean I can't this Animax fan
is really quiet I can't even hear it the
only thing I can hear at the moment is
my aircon it's a little bit hot today
I'm just cooling it down to try and get
the ambient ends to 25 degrees which is
my
every ambient temp that I love testing
things up but yeah so we're gonna run
some benchmarks now and show you guys
what the results are all right so I
thought before the results this is the
final video before the results this is
another way you can mount this so I
really like this cooler you can as you
can see here I've mounted it fading
facing the north of the not motherboard
so this is actually a lot better as you
can see there there's finally a gap
between my ni C and the heat sink now so
it's really good I also noticed better
temperatures slightly with this way
because of the fact that my heat sink if
you look at your heat sink closely there
will be imperfections with it so look at
the contact plate and see which way
would be better for you now the RAM as
well something to notice with this is
you will want low profile memory if you
do the install this way so that's
something to take into account anyway
let's move on to the results alright so
here's the results for you guys on the
left here is the Animax t40 now this is
a 27 degrees ambience six-minute run in
prime95 it's the max heat test it's a
this is on a deleted chip as well I have
deleted my house well chip it's running
at 4.2 gigs at 1.12 volts now I am using
cool laboratory's liquid pro on the core
and pk3 on the internal head spray heat
spreader on the right this is my water
cooler now this piece of died
already but this thing I did put cool
amorites liquid pro on the core and on
the actual heat spreader itself when I
was doing my testing this is a video I'm
gonna make soon I've done all the
results I'm gonna make that video soon
for you guys comparing heatsink pace
against one another but as you can see
there it's 25 degrees ambience it's same
set you know same settings 4.2 gig 1.2 1
2 volt it performed on my in my opinion
three degrees worse than the Animax t 40
so that says a lot for the Animax t 40
this thing is just amazing i am so
impressed with the Animax
you know they should just rename that
company to energies because i literally
wanted to jizz all over this product it
is just that's led the best 30 dollars i
have spent on a tech product in a long
time let's give you guys a look at a 4.6
gig overclock
seven degrees ambient temps this was
done at again yeah in the summer I mean
4.6 gigs in the summer this thing didn't
even cap 70 degrees you guys have to
remember that prime95 is a heat stress
tester I mean you are not gonna you know
most a lot of games you know you're
never really going to see these temps
this is just like a maximum theoretical
testing program and for it to not even
pop 70 degrees in the summer you know
for a $30 cooler this thing is just
amazing I'm gonna recommend these things
in my budget builds hands down now over
the cooler masters over pretty much any
other cooler this thing is perfect for
house well you know it just cools the
sink so efficiently I think I'll go for
a 4.8 gig over might even try for a 5
gig this thing is just amazing so Animax
really does give you max value for money
kudos to Animax for the such an amazing
cooler I can highly recommend it just an
amazing experience 11 LGA 1150 it fits
absolutely no problems be careful though
with high profile memory you may have a
problem there if you wish to install
that so if you're gonna buy your memory
you're gonna buy with this cooler maybe
get some low profile memory also be
careful of that you know as you saw with
my installation the ni C was really
close so I actually had to refit it
another thing I did do I did make a
slight mistake in the installation video
I did mount the final bracket that
pressurizes the core down I did mount
that upside down so just twist that
around and put it in with the little
dots going into the groove anyway that's
about it guys if you enjoyed this review
please give it a thumbs up and if you
haven't already subscribed attack your
city well be coming back to you guys
soon with a video comparing thermal
paste so I'm gonna be putting all these
I've done all the tests already I've got
all the results I'm just going to put
them into graphs and videos for you guys
and yeah there is also pretty
interesting so we got pk3 our tekzilla 5
and cout laboratories liquid pro so
anyway guys amazing value for money this
product is the shiznit so if you're
looking for a CPU cooler and you're on a
4 core I can
ha thoroughly recommend this product is
just amazing you guys peace out for now
