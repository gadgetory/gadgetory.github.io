getting asked a lot lately and that is
should I upgrade to Windows 10 well
hopefully i will answer that for you
guys in today's video
ladies and gentleman welcome back to
check yes city this is bryan coming back
to you guys today with some gameplay
commentary over metro last light it's
actually a really good game i can
recommend it that being said though
there's a big question that lingers and
it gets constantly asked around takia
city and that is should i upgrade to
windows 10 or should i just simply stay
on windows 8.1 or Windows 7 and now this
is honestly one of those things that's
up in the air though I'm leaning more
towards on the don't update until you
absolutely have to and some of those
absolutely have to issues are obviously
dx12 I think that's the biggest issue
with Windows 10 now Windows 10 is the
only OS that is going to have native
support for DirectX 12 and that means if
these games come out that support
DirectX 12 you're going to have to use
Windows 10 in order to extract the
benefits of DirectX 12 which sucks right
because I am honestly enjoying Windows
8.1 just a bit better than I am Windows
10 I think 8.1 in my opinion is still
the snappiest OS out there to date not
only that you don't have to worry about
these privacy settings all these are
invasive spyware practices that
Microsoft have been corporated into
Windows 10 and it was oddly enough this
is another thing that I'm going to talk
about the pc that i upgraded in
australia that was on Windows 10 pearl
edition and that felt actually pretty
snappy though the one i recently
upgraded upstairs which is my editing
rig i updated that to a Windows 10 home
edition and for some reason that
actually felt quite a bit more sluggish
than the windows 10 Pro Edition so if
that's anything to go by I would
recommend getting the pro edition if you
had to get one edition of Windows 10
home vs pro i'd recommend you go with
pro edition that being said this still
is that question of the new features i
mean obviously there are some great new
features in Windows 10 I mean I love
that search bar on the task bottom and I
can't get enough of that thing I
absolutely love it I also like the fact
that they've got the virtual desktops
and it works really well in Windows 10
tho those two features for me personally
aren't enough to pull me to Windows 10 i
still think the OS is a little bit buggy
I mean when I'm
opening up the new edge browser for
example things just take too much time
sometimes websites just freeze randomly
and also it feels like the OS as I
mentioned before is just that bit more
sluggish than 8.1 or Windows 7 ever was
it kind of in a sense sometimes it feels
like you're on a cloud based OS which is
a weird thing though for what it's worth
the OS does look pretty though that
being said I still do prefer my windows
8.1 look I mean I could customize the
taskbar and all the windows to any color
I liked and I thought that was a great
addition with Windows 8.1 over 7 and now
that they've taken that away i'm kind of
sad that i can't do that with windows 10
or at least can't do it yet so they're
us there is a bit of work to be done in
Windows 10 and honestly me personally
with my main rig since to the other rigs
I upgrade at are in Windows 10 and my
main rig is still on Windows 8.1 I'm
going to be keeping my windows 8.1 rig
as it is that's my main Rick I'm not
going to be updating at any time soon of
course when a DX 12 title comes out that
I do wish to play religiously then I
will be upgrading to Windows 10 on my
main rig though for now I am personally
holding out as I've been able to try
windows 10 and I kind of get I think it
honestly though from what I see with the
resource meter and from what other
people are telling me to is that it's
more resource intensive unfortunately
then Windows 8.1 so that's a sad fact
about Windows 10 at the current moment
so anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this
quick video about Windows 10 vs windows
8.1 and vs windows seven if you have any
comments or anything you wish to add
then please drop a comment in the
comment section below and I'll get back
to you as soon as i can though yeah I
appreciate your feedback both from my
honest opinion with Windows 10 it's just
not worth upgrading at the moment though
keep in mind though that that free
update is available until July next year
so you do have a bit of time still to
play around with Windows 8.1 or Windows
7 and I don't see any dx12 titles or any
fully native dx12 titles being released
to the PC anytime soon so just like me
if you guys are kind of on the
on whether to upgrade and you have no
reason to upgrade everything's working
perfectly the moment on Windows 8.1 07
then I would just honestly hold out
that's my opinion though if you've
already updated to windows 10 you're
probably enjoying it and it is a good OS
beside some of the privacy things and
just that sluggish feeling that's about
it for me today guys if you liked this
video then please give it a thumbs up
and if you haven't already subscribed to
take your city where I'll be coming back
to you guys with more tech news and
