Lav Mics - Stony Edge Simple Lav Review</b></h2><h5 class="post__date">2015-12-10</h5><div class="container"><div class="video-responsive"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7u8i_XLOE0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="post__text">so it's time to take a look at the
simple lavalier microphone from a
company called Stoney edge and we're not
just gonna be stopping there we're gonna
be comparing it to all the other level
ear microphone I have around here on
both the zoom h1 and also the onboard
camera audio itself
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
tech est this is brian coming to you
guys today with the lavalier microphone
it's gonna be like a shootout as well
but we'll quickly talk about this
lavalier microphone and water features
and also what it costs and then we'll go
to a microphone shootout and you guys
can be the judges for yourselves so
getting on straight to business here
with the simple lavalier microphone it
comes packaged pretty well in a small
box you also get a little carry pouch
included there and you get 2.6 meters of
cable length which comes to an end of a
four prong connector which will work
with smartphones and the like however if
you do get a splitter or a connector you
can then use it with three prong devices
although that is not included with the
lavalier microphone moving on to the
actual microphone itself comes with a
little pop filter there and you also get
what they say is a point seven
millimeter diaphragm microphone now that
is connected to a metal base and you
also get a metal clip there which is
attachable and detachable so you can use
it depending on your usage scenarios now
the simple lav microphone comes in at
forty nine ninety-five and that includes
shipping you can order it directly from
the Stoney edge site however that being
said let's move on now to the biggest
part of this microphone review and that
is the audio shootout here is what the
onboard camera audio mic will sound like
probably the worst of all these
comparisons so first up here we have the
simple lav here from stony edge this is
how this will sound like from the Canon
EOS ms onboard audio directly now we
have here the nice one lavalier
microphone from a company called nice
labs this is what this will sound like
plug directly into the canon eos m this
is what the sony ECM cs3 lavalier
microphone will sound like plugged
directly into the Canon EOS m camera and
lastly we have here the zoom h1 z--
onboard stereo microphones and you can
probably see what they sound like
compared to the rest of the audio I've
been using here as well this time we
have the nice one lavalier microphone
plugged directly into my zoom h1 so
here's a little bit of a test of what
this microphone will sound like plugged
into an independent audio recording
device so here we have this stony edge
simple lavalier microphone plugged
directly into my Zune
each one this time so this is what this
will sound like plugged into that
independent source and the last of the
lavalier microphone tests is the sony
ECM cs3 plugged directly into my zoom h1
so you can see what that sounds like
compared to the rest of these so in
conclusion I was just quite simply
disappointed with this lavalier
microphone the audio going into it was
decent although it was much more
insensitive compared to the Sony cs3
that I have here and also the nice one
from nice labs and now the Sony cs3 is
about 15 dollars so it's a lot cheaper
than the simple lab microphone in my
opinion it sounds a lot better as well
and it's also a stereo microphone also
on that note to get the actual audio
level around about the same as the Sony
cs3 and the nice one I had to give it a
10 decibel boost in post-processing
software and this meant that it decided
to induce noise when I did that so
overall I wasn't happy with the audio
quality but one thing I was happy with
was the build quality and on this note
I'm going to be giving this product 2
stars out of 5 because the only good
thing is going for it really is the
build quality and also the cable length
is pretty good although the other things
are the most important thing there the
audio quality is just simply missing so
unfortunately I'm not going to be
recommending this product to practically
anyone out there unless they cannot get
the other two microphones that I'm using
in this video or I'm sure there's other
better lavalier microphones out there
especially for the money so guys that's
about it for me today if you have any
questions or comments about this video
then please drop a comment in the
comment section below and I'll get back
to you as soon as I can and also if you
haven't raised subscribe the tech guess
City all the best tech news and reviews
and I'll catch you in another video
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
