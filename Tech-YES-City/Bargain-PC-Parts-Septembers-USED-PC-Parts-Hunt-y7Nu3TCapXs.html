money and it's towards the end of the
month for September and that can only
mean one thing
and that is some use price performance
goodness so strap on in but before we
even strap on in there's one deal that's
come up that requires immediate
attention x99 5820k 32 gigabytes of ddr4
memory x99 motherboard really good
powers playing the gtx 770 now the gtx
770 it's probably the worst thing in
this build everything else is cream of
the crop so we're going to get on this
before someone else does
yeah we just got back from picking this
up now I spoke to where's who I picked
it up off and he said that there were so
many people messaging him about this and
so initially I dropped in a $600 offer
and he just said no there's someone
picking it up literally tomorrow but
first come first serve with it and of
course having 32 gigabytes of ddr4 and a
build itself
screams value not to mention that's got
the six core 12 threaded 5820k x99
motherboard pretty solid power supply as
well not the best but certainly far from
the worst and then it's got a solid SSD
so 240 Huebert SSD as well so really
good value I haven't seen one of these
in a while the old-school LED Zalman
cool as I think they are and that'll be
interesting to see how well they perform
but the idea behind this of course is
clean it up I'd probably be putting it
in a new case and maybe use this for
something on the lower end it doesn't
look that aesthetically pleasing
of course the cable management's a bit
of a jungle sandwich but still better
than the verge but ultimately there's a
lot of value in that build even the gtx
770 which isn't that desirable we could
still probably flip that individually
and bring down the cost of the builds
but right now we're gonna actually go
through some more deals see what we can
find because I didn't have any other
time to check out anything else when a
hot deal comes up you've got a pounce on
it
so we've been pulling up a heap of deals
now and this is actually the next day
because I've been looking for some deals
yesterday and things are kind of drying
out a little bit there's nothing really
good up for sale
I did find a 970 that I put 150 Aussie
down on but the guy wants 200 pretty
much firm so we'll give that a Miss
there's another 970 up for sale and
there's a few other cards up for sale
that aren't really that good value for
money there is this though this is
pretty interesting an alienware x51 are
three desktop machine now it's got an i7
6700 16 gigabytes of RAM the specs look
really good but the case itself is
really small form-factor so I'm gonna do
a little bit of research and see if you
can fit a small graphics card in this
machine for instance like a 1050 Ti
because if you can then that will really
raise the price of this build
you could even maybe swap out an i-5
6400 and that will keep the value
roughly the same for the build itself
but then you'll have a 6700 and your
kitty there's also the next deal up here
we have as well I've been negotiating
with these monitors and there's four of
them for sale for four dollars each now
they're 20 inch monitors and they're
apparently VA panels so I'm gonna go
pick them all up because that definitely
adds to the value if you're selling
something on the real low-end for
instance even a 3 or $400 PC monitors
like that will really give the value of
boost and especially at $4 I mean
there's nothing really to lose here
other deals include some hans g monitors
i remember these from back in the day
surprised to see them up for sale
27-inch 16 by 10 and they won around a
hundred and thirty aussie per pop dad
I'm not too sure I might go pick up one
and just check out what this monitor was
about bit of a nostalgic purchase if so
so we're now on day 3 and this is
probably the first time I think I've
ever done the use PC parts on during
weekdays but some good news has come
about and that is some of the monitors
that I was inquiring about the guy got
back to me today said I can come around
later and pick up three of them for four
dollars a pop so looking forward to
seeing how that goes because this will
be the cheapest monitor I've ever picked
up in my life and I just hope it works
but some other really good news is I've
given les a call and he's got some
leather licious deals for us so we're
gonna go up now and go see him and
hopefully clean him out if he's got some
really good deals but on a sidenote
Gumtree really is a drought at the
moment there's no real good deals up
there and I think anything that's good
that comes up will get snatched up
straight away the Alienware PC is a
little bit of a gamble in my opinion
they want 520 for it I just said come
back and said no 500 flat and we got a
deal so I'll see how that goes as well
but let's go check out what lasers girl
for us
so we just got back from lasers and he
did some really good deals we've got to
i7 rigs here with 26 hundreds in the
megabytes of RAM harddrive all that jazz
we've also got an i3 system as well I
three twenty two twenty eighty bytes of
RAM harddrive I think we picked this up
485 AUD a pop and these two for about
150 AUD H so really good bargains since
I brought king of the coast along as
well and he bought a lot of stuff let's
decide to throw in a power supply for
absolutely nothing which is 700 watt
that's really good but actually my
favorite part of the deal is right here
besides these rigs and this is 3 HP
monitors their IPS panels 1080p 23 inch
displays we pick these up for 50 AUD a
pop and I've got a nice feeling seeing
all these three monitors just all beside
each other how about a budget triple
surround setup since I was gonna do a
world of warcraft PC but I figured
instead of just doing this world of
warcraft PC with sort of like value for
money new parts but also maybe a hostile
gtx 1070 TI and see what kind of bill we
can create so stay tuned for that i'm
really looking forward to that because
maybe this is a new meadow if you can
get a budget triple surround setup
especially for next to nothing then why
not if the deals are there but since
we've got stuck in a lot of traffic
going up to brisbane I just think we
picked a bad time which is close to peak
time in Australia that's kind of like
nowadays like 3 to 5 p.m. we got stuck
at rapid a long time so I had to hold
back the guy selling the four dollar
monitors so we're gonna go pick that up
now even though it's round about 7 p.m.
so we need to pick those up now and see
what kind of value we can extract out of
that then we'll come back and have a
look more in depth at these parts
so I just got back from picking up those
monitors and he actually had five on
hand his name was Chris and he's a
really nice guy we had a chat about just
some things he was into filming a little
bit and it's really good just going out
and meeting people but he had five of
these HP monitors and I decided to put
them in my garage for now because they
had no monitor stands and he said he had
a couple of stands for them but they
were just like completely the wrong fit
so they do have a some mounts on them
it's just I'm going to have to leave
them there until I find some actual if I
come across some bargains on monitors
stands for example then I'll definitely
pick those up because in the meantime
it'll just take off rumens because in
the mean time otherwise it'll just take
up room in the studio and I'll just be
sitting on them being like okay reminder
of how I've got to get monitor stands
but let's for example he had some wall
mount monitor stands that he wanted to
chuck in but I don't think anyone would
be too keen to wall mount a HP 2008
monitor in 2018 but on that for some
reason I'm still a little bit hungry for
deals even though I've got some awesome
deals already we're gonna take a look at
gum tree because I haven't really got
much out of gum tree this month I've got
a 5820k machine that I paid asking price
for and then I got a really good deal on
these monitors which is still not the
core of what we're looking for
so I took an extended peruse through gum
tree just then and there is some okay
deals one deal that popped up was an rx
570 expedition from a Zeus and this was
going for about a hundred and sixty
Aussie and the guy said he want to get
rid of it pretty quickly but that's a
really good deal at that price point
there was some other deals that were
really questionable someone was trying
to sell I think an r7 260x for a hundred
and fifty dollars there was a broken GTX
760 being sold like $60 and then someone
was trying to get $3,000 for 384
gigabytes of ddr3 ECC registered and I'm
not sure that how that works because I
thought ECC registered usually
especially on ddr3 meant to be cheaper
than unbuffered non-ecc and I know you
can pick up brand-new ddr3 modules the
same speeds which is the normal stuff
and that's going for ya cheaper than
that price and so Gumtree at the moments
really especially where I live is
becoming a vulture pit now even that's
the best way to describe it because that
5820k deal for example I had to pay
asking price for that when the guy
clearly said in the ad he was open to
offers
so I'm guessing from that 750 he would
have taken 600 in a usual year maybe
2016 era but 2017 and more people coming
on board now 2018 is just saturated so
we're gonna try and pick up deals here
and there but I guess from Gumtree
itself I'm kind of going to start shying
away for it I will look for deals here
and there but like when it comes to
getting more deals I'll be going to
contacts now that I've has started to
establish and just start to deal with
them directly because yeah some of these
deals just aren't even deals anymore if
so many people are trying to snatch them
up at asking price and then that's going
to especially if what their intentions
are to do with that PC they're not gonna
really be getting that good of value if
they want to build a gaming PC for their
friend or whatever they want to do
because use parts still have the risk of
things not working for instance in the
past when I bought a 6,700 rig there was
32 gigabytes of RAM in it that one of
the 16 gigabyte module
ended up soon being faulty and so that
was pretty much a big crux of that deal
was now worthless and it's not like I'm
going to go claim a faulty 16-gigabyte
stick off the guy sold it to me for a
decent price already that's how the use
market works but other than that if
someone's near that rx5 70s a little bit
far from me definitely go snatch that up
there was also in the can yes fix it
episode there was the mumbo jumbo tron
powers to play I'd never seen one of
these before
when it that came in front of me and now
one's up for sale local to me and it's
funny because here comes another one up
he thinks it's a cp850 what this thing's
like a bigger than usual power supply
and it was just funny to see it up for
sale again but there was another thing
too that came up and that was someone
had an ad and they were selling an Intel
stock cooler for ten dollars and it said
sold and I'm just sitting here
scratching my head I mean if there's any
guys on the Gold Coast who want to pay
ten dollars for Intel stock coolers hit
me up I'll sell them to you for $10 a
pop I mean I just picked up this little
cooler here off Aliexpress this is a
three dollar cooler even comes with an
LED fan so we're gonna be giving this a
dedicated video because you guys have
said you want to see more bargain
choices from Aliexpress and see how they
go so I think three dollars for a cooler
is definitely coming in in terms of bang
for buck so I look forward to giving
that video to you guys and seeing if it
can handle an i7 because I actually know
that it can handle an i5 already but if
it can handle the i7 that's gonna be
fascinating
so to cap up this month's deals so far
we've got this case right here with the
5820k x99 and I might pull out 16 key
watts of ddr4 and keep that for a later
project but I'm kind of not digging this
case at all so it's not really the best
looker when it comes to looks so I might
repurpose it and maybe spray-paint that
cooler inside white and since we've
already got this sort of black and white
theme to grab his card
I may even pull out something like a
focus G white version with the two white
LED fans which is a pretty good case
especially for the money and maybe make
something special out of this whole rig
and see what we can come up with and
then here on the desk we've got the hook
up
for these two i7 rigs and also this
ThinkCentre here with the i3 and these
three monitors man I don't know why I'm
just so excited about these three
monitors here I don't know if that's a
weird thing or not but this is like my
favorite deal out of all these deals
this month I ended optimally not picking
up those monitors as well because lares
had a really good deal on the three
monitors I got already
and with the Alienware PC you're just
getting really a hard drive ddr4 memory
and a 6700 even then it's not too bad a
deal I'm not sure about the motherboard
and how that would go with sort of
different 10 series graphics cards but I
guess the case and the power supply is
really not worth it at all and we got
all five monitors so that's four dollars
each and monitor for 20 in total that's
pretty good deal but they didn't come
with any monitor stands so that's work
in progress and that's about it for this
month's used pod hunt I know some people
will be disappointed that the bogan
didn't come out and call anyone but
honestly some of these deals just they
weren't really there usually I'm pulling
up like 5 or 10 deals at a time and I
can go through and make a few different
calls but this time around was like one
deal at a time sort of crapped up and I
only got two deals off Gumtree in total
and the first one I had to message so
quickly
didn't even have time to film the phone
call because other guys was just trying
to swoop on that and yeah from here on
I'm gonna actually record this tonight
the r-tx 20 atti review so it's I think
it's like almost 10 p.m. now still got
the energy health videos dropping in
probably the next week so stay tuned for
that and if you enjoyed this part son
then be sure to hit that like button let
me know in the comments section below
what was your favorite deal of this
month's episode I'll also update the
description below
if I get any hooks on those offers that
I made on gumtree and with that said I
love each and every one of you and also
finally got some merch finalized it's in
the process gonna be updating that when
it drops so stay tuned so much is in the
works and I'll catch you guys in the
