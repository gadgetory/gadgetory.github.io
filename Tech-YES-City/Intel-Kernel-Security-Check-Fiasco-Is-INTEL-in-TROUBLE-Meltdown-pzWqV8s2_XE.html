just broke out and this is a potential
security flaw in intel x86 CPUs that
apparently dates back as far as the
first generation core of ice series
chips
these are CPUs like the i7 920's and
i-35 50s for example and this security
flaw which needs to be patched still on
Windows has already been patched on Mac
and Linux operating systems and it was
rumored to see a five to thirty percent
performance drop post patch but has
since been reported to see some drops
that are even bigger than that and other
applications where performance hasn't
dropped at all so what exactly is the
problem well we won't know 100% until
Intel lifts their embargo on the issue
and that will be very soon as Windows is
rolling out and update within the next
few days to fix this issue like Mac's
and Linux have already done but a user
on twitter named brain smoke has already
confirmed that the exploit is real and
it directly affects the Intel CPUs as
rumored now the issue itself apparently
comes from a security check that should
be present but is not present on intel
x86 cpus dating back nearly a decade and
also a RM CPUs - oddly enough and here's
where the problem lies apparently low
privileged applications can access
higher privilege application data
through the kernel page table now you're
probably wondering what is the kernel
well here was this guy who made some
awesome chicken there know on a serious
note that's not the kernel we're talking
about the kernel in this regard is a
layer in your operating system that
exists between your applications and the
CPU and memory itself kind of think of
it as a core of the operating system it
also routes applications to use device
drivers - though within this kernel is
essentially a page table which helps
speed up maps between virtual addresses
and physical addresses which is the
memory of your ddr4 or ddr3 and within
that is the same addresses that are
constantly being used then a portion of
cache dedicated the page table mapping
will then remember where to map the
virtual to physical addresses and save
time though with the TLB aka translation
lookaside buffer doesn't have a memory
of the mapping then the applications
virtual address will then go to the page
table to see if the mapping of the
physical address is there if not then it
will
subsequently access something like your
hard drive or SSD so now the problem
itself lies within this page table and
the solution on Intel CPUs is to
momentarily isolate this page table at
least until the physical address is
mapped and then after that the
processing can continue forward however
of course by doing this isolation there
is a delay introduced and of course
delays equal less performance and this
is not what we paid for when we bought
those brand new Intel shiny CPUs or even
$7.00 eons from our Lee Express though
the good news is that AMD CPUs
especially the price performance hitters
Verizon are not affected by the security
flaw at all as their CPUs implement a
security check where lower privileged
applications that try to access this
higher privilege information within the
kernel or page table will be met with a
page fault or quite simply rejected
though that still leaves us with the
question of how much will performance be
affected and a Linux Hardware site
called for onyx has already tested the
post patch performance versus the pre
patch performance on two different Intel
CPUs a 6800 K and an 8700 can I'll put
the links in the description below and
they found there to sometimes be a huge
performance drop even to the tune of
more than that reported 30% and
sometimes absolutely none and the half
decent news at least to the majority of
you guys and myself included is that the
update doesn't affect gaming or single
computer star workstation productivity
at least preliminary numbers and that's
things like video encoding or rendering
to now of course here at Tech yes City I
will be crunching some numbers for you
guys post windows 10 update and letting
you know if there are any funny bug is
taking place though of course the
performance hits are looking like they
will affect one market in particular and
that is the server market at least when
massive amounts of data input and output
rights are concerned that is Google
Facebook and Amazon servers cloud
storage services virtual machines and
the list goes on and this unfortunately
fair Intel is a massive amount of their
market share and to further complicate
things the CEO himself has reportedly
sold off practically half of his stock
in the last couple of months and now
holds the bare minimum required for the
job
so interesting times ahead to say the
least but honestly Intel
can't you just get things right i mean
by apparently not having the cpu
security check enabled they gain more
performance and with that they're now
doing a number on themselves but i guess
with that they did get the short-term
gains but ten years so probably not
short or medium-term but they probably
actually got long-term gains out of this
and yeah though honestly this doesn't
surprise me I mean just look at the
thermal paste Fiasco in the history of
rigging benchmarks and suppliers NuForce
motherboards with same sockets every
single year and you can only wonder why
people while wanting to buy AMD CPUs now
on other news AMD stocks are up five
percent and Intel stocks are down four
percent an Nvidia stocks are up 6.5% so
I guess this whole cpu fiasco makes
people want to buy a graphics card and
that's about it for me today guys if you
enjoyed this video then be sure to hit
that like button and let me know in the
comment section below what you think of
this whole fiasco I honestly think that
it comes at a time when really weird
things are going on in the market I mean
take a look at the top two institutional
investors for AMD and Intel they're both
the same companies I mean the sales of
CPUs have been in decline in the last
few years anyway so wouldn't you pick
either one of the other but both I mean
something seems a little fishy here also
the new urgency P use apparently won't
be affected as much due to a technology
called PC ID or process context
identifies so I just have this inkling
that for some reason ask price
performance enthusiasts will get screwed
over the most I mean the exploit has
potentially existed for ten years and
it's just ironic that it's coming to the
surface now when use price performance
pcs are getting very popular ddr4 Ram
prices are very high though really
nothing surprises me in a market where
the whole industry is built on new
products and sales of those new products
anyway guys I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
