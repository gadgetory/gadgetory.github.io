fallout 4 which has just been released
as of today and the big question on
everyone's mind is is it smooth ladies
and gentlemen welcome back to check yes
city this is bryan your smooth operator
coming back to you guys today was kind
of like a mini review of fallout 4 and
also answering that question of is it
smooth however that being said i think
it should be rephrased of can it be
smooth and that is the question with
this game just like black ops 3 the
answer is yes it can be smooth providing
you tweak settings and play around with
different fixes now i will be posting up
a dedicated video on how to get this
game to run as smooth as it can and
that'll be coming out very soon so stay
tuned for that but today i also wanted
to talk about quickly the gameplay and
the story which i'll first and foremost
say that Bethesda have done an
absolutely phenomenal job in making this
game immersive so if you're looking for
a game that will give you just hours and
hours and hours of role-playing then it
fallout 4 is the game for you I mean not
just from this get-go the story is
immersive but also the gameplay itself
right they give you the option to create
your own custom character as well as the
stats and then you've got all the perks
there and there's just literally a
plethora of different things that you
can do in this game so I'm really liking
the customization the story and the game
play thus far now another big question
that needs to be addressed is the
graphics a lot of people will be like
what other graphics like in this game
brain and honestly they're decent
they're not the best thing I've seen
especially for a game out in 2015 but
they're far from the worst if I was to
give you guys an example I'd say it'd be
a case of pulling the panties to the
side rather than pulling them completely
off people familiar with the Skyrim
graphics system will pretty much be
familiar with the graphics in this game
if I was to say anything they look very
similar plus a new bunch of fancy
lighting effects for instance god rays
which will show you God's fingers during
the daytime with clouds and things like
ambient occlusion have def
made improvements but the core graphics
and the textures do feel a lot like
Skyrim 5 for what it's worth however all
is not well in the land of fallout 4
there was some negative things that I
initially didn't like about this game
the first being the amount of
anti-aliasing options there's literally
two options they're both which suck in
my opinion fxaa is horrible and also TAA
looks like complete crap I would have
loved to have seen either of my two
favorite options in there either msaa or
SMAA however none of those made it into
the game and even when I tried to force
on Nvidia's mfa a technology that didn't
turn on either even when I try to force
it on so I would like to see some more
anti-aliasing options as well as the
fact that shadows in this game really
chunk up performance it was something
that I was looking forward to with the
shadows and since they have improved a
lot in this game I noticed that when you
turn the shadows up and it's what's
something that I'll talk about in the
performance fix video though I was I
noticed that the shadows really
contributed to stuttering as well so
that was another problem in itself when
I first build up this game even though
it recommended me ultra settings when it
optimized the settings for me I loaded
up the game and it was stuttering like
crap I was like what is going on here so
I would have liked to a sympathy stir
maybe beta test this game a little bit
more with some performance orientation
in mind especially for people like me
who hate input lag and hate stuttering
and on that note we'll move into the
next thing that I didn't like and that
is the input lag by default it is
horrible on this game you will either
want to disable vertical sync completely
or turn on g-sync or free sync if your
monitor has those technologies though
keep in mind though if you are not using
g-sync or free sync the frame or the
screen tearing in this game will be
pretty bad however all in all the
gameplay and the story are definitely
there I mean the amount of features and
options in this game is incredible so i
can highly recommend it based on those
two things alone though it's just like
black ops 3 I would have loved to send
more thorough testing done in relation
to the performance before this game was
released I mean if they gave me a copy
for instance
in the pre beta stages for instance I
could have tested these things for them
and let them know I just don't like it
when games come out especially for the
majority of people who don't even know
what half these options mean and they
get a game that run late runs like crap
because I know this is going to be the
case with fallout 4 a lot of people are
going to be saying this game doesn't run
that well even though they absolutely
love the story and they love the
gameplay so I would love to send them
may be optimized the settings with some
more warnings in there or more basically
more simple options for people to choose
where they can get a smooth experience
they can get a smooth experience with
screen tearing or they get a smooth
experience with input lag so guys that's
about it from a quick review of this
game keep in mind though I have to play
a lot more of it and I certainly will be
as I'm really enjoying it after I fixed
up all the settings and the stuttering
and i can highly recommend it and i also
picked it up from CD keys com for pretty
cheap i'll put the link in the
description below where you can check it
out and if you use my affiliate link if
you can support the channel and all the
videos to come sorry guys i hope you
enjoyed this video peace out for now and
i'll catch in another video very soon
