down with an Rx 480 and an i5 2500 k
overclocked though things just didn't
work out and instead I decided to pit to
old-school graphics cards against one
another not only to take a look at how
they did back then when they were first
released but also how they do now with
those back then type games this is part
one of the old-school showdown
this video was brought to you by Full

welcome back to takia City this is brain
coming to you guys today with a
comparison of two old yet modern
graphics cards named idli the 660ti
which I picked up for around about a
hundred dollars and more recently the
7850 which I managed to score for sixty
dollars now the main focus of today's
video is comparing the games from back
then with updated drivers from 2016 and
seeing how these cards perform today
though before we get onto that let's
take a trip down memory lane so when
both these graphics cards were released
in 2012 the gtx 660ti was leagues ahead
of the 7850 from what we can see with
archived benchmarks from an intact we
can see that this graphics card the 60
CTI was like a good 30% ahead of the 78
50 back then though what about 2016 when
we get some of those back then titles
and put the 7850 against the 660ti with
updated drivers so let's take a look
so there's benchmarks all out of the way
there with some old titles on the latest
drivers from both gravis cards we can
see that the 7850 is really only about
10% behind when we contrast that to 2012
that 7850 was almost a good 30% behind
so it's painting a completely different
picture nowadays and it's going to show
how much value you can get out of those
old-school AMD cards which is something
that I've been critiqued for in the past
with may use budget builds it's like
people like Brian why are you always
using old-school AMD cards a lot of the
time and this is exactly why I guess
part 1 of this video or this series is
showing how much those AMD cards are
still evolving over time even in
old-school titles now I did overclock
both these graphics cards but around
about 100 megahertz each so they are
kind of on similar playing fields when
it comes to overclocks as well though
another thing I will point out is that I
did have to change the thermal paste on
the 7850 when I was benchmarking and
initially I noticed that the
temperatures were like spiking to like a
hundred degrees and I knew something was
wrong though when I pulled off the
heatsink it was like some burnt up
mayonnaise had been put on there so it
was weird I had to clear that up put on
some mx4 and we were back in business
they're not getting too far off topic we
can see that the 660ti is still a decent
card in today's titles at 1080p it
seemed with the 7850 the one thing I
will point out is that I did have sort
of streamlined performance for the 60
CTIA and these are the settings that I
like to play games at 1080p low msaa say
two-speed also high settings and so if I
did turn the MSAA up I'm sure it would
have favored the 7850 that much more the
only way I look forward to giving you
guys part 2 of this video where I'll be
testing some more modern day titles and
also I might even throw in a dx12 and
Vulcan benchmark between these two
old-school cards maybe you guys would
like to see that also I was going to do
a build with this PC though I don't know
do you guys still want to see that let
me know in the comment section below
and also if you haven't already be sure
to hit slam pump abuse and whatnot to
that like button and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
I know you guys want blue biz but today
was just like smooth sailing I just woke
up and I'm all energetic and just did
the tag it was and then she said take my
graphics card and I said sure I'll take
you grab scott i'll put it into my pc
and then he said I'll give you my RAM
