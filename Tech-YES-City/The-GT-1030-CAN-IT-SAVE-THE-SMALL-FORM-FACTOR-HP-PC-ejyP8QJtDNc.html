form-factor piece see that I picked up
in a used parts on a few months ago on
the channel now when I went to put in a
low-profile 750ti
it did boot but it just froze completely
so with this PC in general I tried a few
different things I tried different
tricks when you boot it up
I tried hitting all the key combinations
when booting it up I tried updating the
bass and that still didn't work with the
750ti so today I'm going to go out and
get a GT 1030 put it in this rig and see
if it'll work absolutely ok because what
people say is that these motherboards
just don't have the power limit to
support one of these graphics cards so
that could be the problem and it could
be the 750ti itself I don't have another
750ti on hand to test but I just know
one thing this one just doesn't work at
all
so it might even be dead now so that
that that might even be a problem that
happened just when I was I don't even
know why that would die but but anyway
the GT 1030 is a really inexpensive
graphics card you can pick one of these
up in Australia brand-new for $88 so
that would be like 60 something USD
extremely cheap of course it's not going
to perform anywhere as good as even a
GTX 1050 or 1050 Ti but it is a good
little fix for a gaming PC that could
play the titles like csgo for example
dota 2 league of Legends and of course
it won't break the bank
but anyway the biggest benefit of the GT
1030 as I said before is it'll actually
work in PCs or hopefully I've got to
test it still in pieces like these that
don't support the 75 watt higher power
consumption cards so hopefully this
little 30 watt card does work miracles
on this PC and if it does we're gonna go
test it out in a few games as well
is rich
and we just got back and now we've got
to GT 1030 sitting on the table here you
guys are probably like damn why is Bryan
getting two of these things well the
reason is I'm gonna be putting one in
this haitch pea machine in the core i5
2400 machine but I'm also going to be
putting this little one here in my
mobile editing rig and I want to do some
tests with that that'll probably be a
separate video but we see here this
one's so tiny so we install a little low
profile bracket on it and it'll fit into
the little in wind choppin so when it
comes to this one and the size you know
I'm happy with my size so security is
people when they buy computers generally
bigger is better so this is why I got
this one even though it's a little bit
more expensive it's such a bigger
heatsink it's like damn look at the size
of that thing and so that's what people
see when you put that inside it's got
this big chunky graphics card in so the
person's gonna think oh wow this
computer is gonna be awesome so when I
go to sell this thing it's gonna sell
better and it's also gonna have a
satisfied customer or a much more
satisfied customer when they see a
bigger looking graphics card even though
they perform pretty much identical it's
just gonna go a lot better in this day
and age when you're trying to hustle and
sell parts as opposed to this if they
saw this in there they'd be like damn is
that thing even gonna be able to run
games man so that's kind of like the
reaction that you don't want so you get
the bigger one
so this one right here we've got the low
profile bracket on the the problem is
it's even smaller than low-profile so it
just won't fit at all and I'm not gonna
hack that up seriously like if i hack
that up that's going to have to bash
this power supply in because it doesn't
even fit vertically either so it's it's
really small like in wind made this
super tiny and super small I mean maybe
in a revision of the case if they just
made it a little bit lower and able to
fit one of these in it'd be really good
but besides that there's nothing much I
can do there I'm really just dependent
upon the HD graphics on the CPU and this
one here so that's just our spare GT
1030 lying around but let's try and boot
this thing up and see if we can play
some games on it
so now we've installed the graphics card
we've actually tried the other one too
and we've got basically no signal once
the drive is installed and it's working
properly and funny thing is it's not
working properly so what this means is
the basic display adapter works however
once it enables the driver and I guess
it utilizes all the vram it cuts out
which means it's definitely the PCIe
power delivery so it is a limit
implemented by HP on this motherboard
and it means that we can't get over that
so we're gonna instead of trying to get
over it we're gonna try and get around
it so we're actually gonna use one of
these things for cryptocurrency miners
Reiser and since it's got its own
separate power supply it may be just
able to power this graphics card without
any problem so we'll see if that works
if it doesn't then man I'm just this is
one of the worst days ever I've got a
two man bought to GT 10 30s and they
both don't work on the applications but
let's give this a try anyway
last chance
so anyway guys I'm just so tired I tried
going down this whole custom bias route
and tried really everything I've spent
hours on this thing pav well over at a
video testy as well he gave me the
custom vos modded it we extracted the
files in winzip to try and replace the
BIOS
they try to force flash it in dass tried
to do it in windows multiple different
times multiple different settings this
was just locked down like HP locked down
the boss force flashes so hard and
that's something that only they could
really do they could only change the
settings and then implement their own
custom BIOS update themselves and
release it out to the public so I give
up
I'm over it I can't get this thing to
work I can get it to work it's just that
it works on a basic display adapter and
then when it changes over to it's a
normal driver it then stops working so
it doesn't matter what grabs card you
put on this thing it's just not going to
work but however I want to try and do
something to get a little compact PC
like this working because we've got a
hard drive got the cooler
we got the memory we've got the power
supply we've got the case and it is a
little sleeper if it does have this GT
1030 and so we're gonna try and replace
and all the motherboard and first before
we do that we're gonna make sure that
the graphics card works with it and it
boots the windows and then see if we can
put it in this case and get it working
and see if we could make a PC out of
nothing and then we keep the i-5 2400
for a later date and we're gonna truck
this motherboard out I am over I hated
this motherboard hate it
nothing nothing nothing we're just do
not getting any signal out of this PC as
well and I'm getting so frustrated so
I'm gonna keep these GT ten 30s I'm
gonna pull off the CPU take the RAM out
and just chuck these HP's in the bin and
forget they ever existed at this place
just a bad memory so basically there it
is I haven't failed this hard in a long
time and I mean it's not my fault I gave
it everything I could I tried different
graphics cards I try the low powered
ones and we almost got it working but of
course there's just a security check on
that HP BIOS that really doesn't allow
the graphics card to work properly I
mean I've got no idea why they're doing
that I don't even think it's a legacy
ROM because we did get into Windows we
did make it into Windows with the GT
1030 as opposed to the other one the 70
Ti which didn't even make it into
Windows that is froze at the boot screen
so that was probably another problem but
yeah basically I mean anyway I just
sometimes he's just gonna be real
careful which oMG get this HP SF 3300
it's it's the pro series or something so
I'm guessing you stay away from the
business ones the pro series I'm
guessing they have the protection as
well Pro stands for protection and yet
you just can't get a graphics card to
work in these things properly so you got
to use the onboard HD graphics and you
probably hear by the sound of my voice
I'm just over it I'm so over it anyway
guys hope you enjoyed this video if you
did them sure to hit that like button
and let me know in the comment section
below if there's anything that you would
do to this HP machine to get it working
I'm obviously I'm not trying anything
else I've tried so much I'm not trying
anymore it's going in the bin I'm over
it
we're gonna use that i5 2400 and a later
date and a later build but I'm just
completely over it so I'll catch you in
the next Tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
so this is a - wine and this is a
driving iron they kind of rare
so really rare so I'll pick these up for
five Australian dollars a pop so please
that's gonna kind of calm my nerves down
a little bit that's what you get for
being optimistic - GT ten 30s that you
never wanted</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
