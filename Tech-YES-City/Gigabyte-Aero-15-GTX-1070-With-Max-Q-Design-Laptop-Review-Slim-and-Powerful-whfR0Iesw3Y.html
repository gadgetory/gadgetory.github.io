laptop from gigabyte which features a
gtx 1070 max-q edition so these things
are designed to be extremely slim and
also use a lot less power than their
desktop variants and now speaking of the
power consumption when we're in games
for instance pub G playing with ultra
settings at 1080p this whole machine
even with the monitor on full brightness
with the mouse connected was only
juicing around a hundred and thirty five
watts from the wall extremely impressive
considering the performance figures and
speaking of those performance figures
this is a 1070 that does perform a
little bit less than a desktop variant
1070 but it still does beat out at GTX
1066 gigabyte desktop Edition so let you
guys take a look at the performance
figures then we'll take a more in-depth
look at the error 15
so the error 15 does perform really well
with the i7 7700 HQ turbos up to 3.8
gigahertz on a single thread and also
with its multi-core performance you get
3.4 gigahertz so in a Cinebench run it
did score quite high getting in the 700
point range and also when you're going
to use this for rendering videos it will
do an absolutely fine job as the
temperatures measured on this CPU and a
stress test went up to around about 80
and then closing in on 90 degrees even
when gaming so this is acceptable for a
laptop like this keep in mind this is in
28 degree ambient temperatures and also
the ventilation of the top and rear of
the laptop is doing a great job of
exhausting hot air so it's not gonna
come near your face or blow on your face
like some other laptops I've tested in
the past however as you did here before
the noise can get quite loud especially
when the GPU is being fully stressed but
one cool thing about the Max akyuu
design is it does share the GPU cool
with the CPU so if you are doing some
CPU intensive tasks even if you're on
battery life for example then it will
take some time for those fans to RAM
pins so if you are doing some quick work
on the computer crunching numbers or
doing something very intensive for even
a couple of minutes the noise will
remain still very quiet they're more
into the hardware side of things taking
off the backplate reveals two slots for
ddr4 memory so dim it comes with two
eight gigabyte sticks in this case you
can upgrade this to two 16 gigabyte
sticks for a total of 32 and I believe
there may be another edition of this
laptop that comes with a single channel
16 gigabyte stick I'd probably prefer
that as if I got something like this
personally I'd love to use it for a
video rendering on the go and also
playing some games if I got some free
time the monitor itself is an MVA panel
1080p 60 Hertz it's got great viewing
angles and it looks very good it also
features the X right color calibration
now x-ray are a company that do make
color calibrators for monitors so if
it's calibrated by them then you know
it's going to perform very well if you
need color accuracy from the get-go as
soon as you open this up so if you may
have seen with some of the shots already
the error 15 packs in extremely thin
bezel it's actually probably the
thinnest bezel I've seen on a laptop to
date egg you buy it states that this
enables the error 15 to perform and
function more like a 14 inch laptop but
with that biggest screen and when I
compared it to the Alienware laptop that
I picked up for $50 here it does
come in close to the size though not
exactly as small as a 14-inch laptop
though speaking of the dimensions the
depth is 22 millimeters high and this is
because of that max-q design you get a
very thin laptop and of course it's 350
millimeters long by 250 millimeters tall
so it is quite a small laptop for its
features you do get an all alloy
construction on the body as well there
are some bits of plastic around the
memory card for example but for what
it's worth most of the laptop body is
constructed from alloy does give it a
very good finish and also a very sturdy
feel now when we're looking at the
weight of this unit 2.2 kilograms and
also the adapter itself 450 grams so if
it's one thing to focus on when it comes
to positives on a laptop it's the size
and the power and this thing has a both
though also the adapter itself is very
thin and small too it's a 150 watt
adapter it also has its own little port
for charging USB devices which is very
handy to has an LED indicator light as
well to let you know when the device is
charging and it's on and also with that
it's very lightweight coming in at 450
grams as I said before so carrying this
thing around in total 2.6 kilo roughly
and that's great for travel if you need
to keep the weight down now another
impressive thing about this laptop is it
does come included with a 512 gigabyte
Samsung S m9 6-1 nvme SSD there is
another slot too for another nvm s to
see if you want to double up on storage
or just get another backup for editing
videos however with that said the
performance on this thing is extremely
impressive over 2500 megabytes per
second and reads rights for over 1500
megabytes per second the SSD school was
very impressive too though keep in mind
one thing I'll have to critique about
this is out of the box these settings
slowed down the right speed so you will
have to turn off that buffer flash
caching in the options if you want to
speed this thing up which I highly
recommend is you're missing out on some
big write speeds which are of course
important if you need to do very intense
writes now on the right side of the
basis unit you get two USB 3s in on the
left you get an additional one of those
USB to make a total of three USB 3 ports
and also on the side you get a
thunderbolt type-c connector which can
to support extra displays as well
coupled with the mini DisplayPort 1.3
and also the HDMI 2.0 out
you can support up to three displays
externally on the air 15 and there's
also a handy SD card reader included and
right below the monitor and above the
keyboard there is a 1080p HD web camera
with a sensor next to it - so very odd
position for a web camera though it did
work pretty well in practice and did
give out quite a decent picture so it is
good for doing Skype calls or business
calls though you will get an angle
that's kind of looking up at your
nostrils and below that is the power
button and also another very important
feature of the aro 15 and that is the
keyboard which is RGB backlit and you
can change the speed combinations
individually back like the keys assign
macros as well and even control things
like fans from the keyboard itself with
the fusions software so the fusion
software is very feature packed but you
can also change the brightness - and it
is extremely bright for a laptop
keyboard I actually like the neon color
combination the best and of course the
static yellow looked pretty cool as well
though when it came to typing on this
thing the scissor type switches were
very quiet and I did manage to score a
decent score in typing test on my first
run there for me personally I do prefer
a mechanical keyboard with a wrist rest
however this is one of the best laptop
keyboards I've used Bar None and
although the keyboard is quite good
below that is the sensor pad which has
really good sensitivity and it's sort of
like an all integrated left and right
click and movement in one though I did
have a difficult time using this with
two different fingers I do prefer the
buttons to be segregated from the actual
main movement sensor and with the
movement sensor itself when you do set
the option to plug in a mouse it does
keep active so it is annoying to type on
if you're using it with a mouse and
keyboard style using the laptop keyboard
though with that in mind when you did to
disable this feature in the options and
then unplug the mouse it remained
disabled so that was very annoying I
would like to see this bug improve with
a software update though what about the
sound and speakers the crosstalk was
really good on this laptop it comes with
two speakers left and right in stereo
configuration and the sound was a little
bit tinny though it was still pretty
good to play games on I found
playing pub gee I could easily discern
left and right channels and of course
plugging in a headphone you got very
good sound coming out of that - and this
is a hybrid port so you can plug a four
pin in and still use a microphone - and
now the last feature about the arrow 15
which is quite impressive is the battery
life it features quite a big 94 watt
hour battery that if you take off the
back of the case you can see actually
how thin and how wide it is and this
does a very good job of keeping the air
15 powered on battery for around about
three and a half hours if the brightness
of the screen is on the lowest setting
however upping the brightness to the
maximum setting I only managed to get
about an hour and 20 minutes of battery
life and on both these tests I was
watching movies and charging the battery
itself takes a few hours and it does use
about 50 watts from the wall so now its
conclusion time with the arrow 15 from
gigabyte and this is in my opinion how a
laptop should be done if you guys want
that high performance but still want
something that's extremely small and
doesn't use much power then this is
gonna be the laptop for you an i7 7700
HQ CPU that goes up to 3.4 gigahertz
expendability for up to 32 gigabytes of
sodium memory you've also got one SSD an
nvme 512 gigabyte included and the
option to install more storage if you
wish to makes this laptop a complete
winner in my opinion it's got the forum
it's got the function and also the
screen as well is really good to boot
1080p nvm a panel the viewing angles
were incredible and also the battery
life is pretty good to boot and the
included keyboard is very easy to type
on to the build quality of course all
alloy construction and this makes this a
lightweight very sturdy unit however one
thing we have to get out of the way with
of course is the price if you're in
Australia this thing will set you back
around about 3100 AUD or if you're in
the US about 2200 USD so it is quite
expensive
however like most things in this world
unless it's the next 58 and at 6 core
zealand you get what you pay for and
without said guys i hope you enjoyed
today's review if you did then be sure
to hit that like button and let me know
in the comments section below what you
think of the error of 15 is it one of
your favourite laptops do you think you
would get one
if you had enough money to afford one
love reading your thoughts and opinions
as always and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon and with that said
gigabyte also send this out as a loan
sample so I do have to return and
unfortunately though I would love to
keep it as it is a really nice laptop
and I'll catch you in an I'll take video
very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
