address the yes where you guys have been
making a lot of comments and some of
them are just either too long to write a
response to or there's just a lot of
comments where I'd just be replying the
exact same thing and there's some things
we've got to talk about first being this
one right here and I just call it wd-40
this is actually not exactly wd-40 it
has the same purpose it's a water
dispersant in the past I've used
different kinds of water dispersant I've
used CRC five five six I've also used
w-4 yourself
and I've never had a problem with it
some people are reporting that it does
leave a sticky residue we've also got
child of light who says his balls have
retracted back into his body
after he saw me using the wd-40 we've
got unknown user who says whoever buys
this is going to be pissed about wd-40
I'm into those people I replied I mean I
sold the build yesterday and the person
who came over and bought it commented
nothing about the smell because the
smell evaporates after literally like
ten minutes and also it just leaves the
computer looking really nice actually
commented on how nice the PC looked and
why I was selling it so cheap so there's
that I mean that's my sort of experience
with using wd-40 and stuff like it now
I'm not too sure about the guys in the
US if you guys are over in the US there
might be a different kind of wd-40 a
different make of it that leaves a
sticky residue I'm not sure but this
stuff here it goes on so well it serves
the purpose of cleaning the product at
the same time giving it that new look
shine as well as being ridiculously
cheap I paid like four dollars a bottle
for this stuff and I get so much usage
out of it it's not funny so it lasts a
long time and because even though the
break clean I have this here and I do
use it I only use this for really dirty
products where I need the high pressure
from this stuff here and some people
have commented why don't I use ECC even
the wd-40 ECC type and that's because in
Australia ECC is so expensive even to
this date is so expensive same trend in
Japan when I was over there ECC was much
more expensive than brake cleaner and so
I used brake cleaner because it does the
same thing it just evaporates a bit
slower and of course saves me a lot of
money w4t of course is the finisher and
sometimes I don't even need to go with
the brake cleaner because the data vac
does a good job of doing a preliminary
clean but ultimately I can't convince
you otherwise to use this it's just in
my channel I've shown over the years
tips and tricks on how you can flip PCs
as well as restore pcs for yourself or
for family members and really just get a
better experience on a budget when it
comes to PC gaming this is one of those
tools that I've been using for years I'm
going to keep using I absolutely love it
this Australian export stuff here I dare
I'd say it's probably the best of the
three variants that I've used in the
past and I'm gonna definitely keep using
this stuff for the next question
Amitabha Paul he says you've kept for
fans in negative pressure verses 2 for
intake won't this be bad for dust with
airflow it depends on the build itself
airflow is one of those things where if
you're going for high performance then
it really matters when it comes to
especially stock builds for example I
don't think about air flow too much in
the past when I've done especially non
overclockable builds I haven't really
focused on the orientation of the fans
but for instance a good push-pull with
positive pressure is the general
standard way of cooling in a PC tower
there are other ways you can do it but I
do believe negative pressure is the best
for dust of course you've got fans
blowing the dust away from the case as
opposed to less fans putting pulling
dust into the case of course dust
filters themselves being the most
important thing if you've got good dust
filters then that's going to reduce the
amount of dust that will remain in the
case itself next comment from Justin I'm
inclined to believe you are the king of
the coast I wish I was but I'm not so
stay tuned for that
Matt Raymond asks what happened to June
ekron is it still relevant and June
ekron I parted with June Acron a quite a
while ago and I used it as my main rig
for a little while and I realized there
was more negatives to using a dual CPU
setup as opposed to a single CPU setup
then it was worth it the main things
being of course with the dual CPU setup
you're going to get better
theoretical scores like Cinebench it's
gonna be a lot higher things like that
are gonna work better but when it came
to gaming for example games some games
just wouldn't load at all properly
another thing as well is it's just in
general it feels to me like it's laggy
are not as snappy and so for me when I'm
flicking a lot of files in Premiere Pro
and doing a lot of things in my editing
software
I need that snappiness when I'm used to
it I want to go with the best option and
now I believe it's x79 but of course I'm
going to show you guys the numbers with
a thousand FPS camera to prove that but
just for me and even my new video editor
Yusuf he agrees as well we're big x79
fanboys now with ddr3 low latency stuff
next comments from ex Cleo he hates the
disappoint but he believes that GPU
mining is coming back and it's just in a
downturn at the moment and this is
referring to actual using graphics cards
consumer based graphics cards like your
GTX 1080s and your Vega 56 or your rx
for 80s for mining cryptocurrency coins
and I kind of disagree I think this time
around I mean back in 2013 you had 12 as
well you had the Bitcoin thing with
Radeon graphics cards and Nvidia cards
weren't a trend at the time they weren't
new but this time around you had Nvidia
graphics cards being able to be used for
mining so it was kind of like if it
brought in a new market and myself
included I was like well I had a lot of
cards on hand at the time as opposed to
2013 so I decided to start mining after
this boss I don't know if GPU mining is
going to become as popular as it ever
was in 2017 because again a lot of
people would have been burned by the
fact that they would have went out and
bought all these expensive mining rigs
and not got their return on investment
especially now mining on GPUs especially
in most parts of the country where you
if you're paying over 20 cents for a
kilowatt hour for example it's not going
to be profitable and so a lot of people
are selling off their mining rigs are me
and the king of the coast we've been
cleaning up on the deals just call us
the janitors we're getting that that
good of a deal and then next we move on
to Charles he says he prefers the
old style of cleaning at IKEA City and I
enjoy it I love cleaning PC parts but
because I've got to move a lot more PC's
and time is a factor I'd love to be able
to spend a lot of time on just cleaning
one PC I mean as some of those pcs back
in the day I would spend over a whole
day just cleaning that up and prepping
it and so I realized I had to find
faster methods to get the same result
and that's why I'm sort of taking you
guys with us on a journey and doing this
any faster method I can find I will do
that and implement that here on the
channel so this is a new matter where
I've got the data vac and I've got the
Dobby d40 on the Australian export at
the same time and I'm just hosing down
those PC parts it's awesome I love it I
can recommend it in terms of the old
metas I will do them from time to time
don't worry when the right bill comes in
that's really filthy which some of those
builds can be really filthy I just
haven't really come into any of them
when some of those really filthy builds
come in you'll see some phase 3 tech yes
loving don't worry
next up Karl says peter baelish
reviewing motherboards subscribed hey
man you can call me whatever you want
Karl and thanks for the subscription
next up we've got filled with is I think
I pronounced that right I might have
butchered it I've lost hope that there
will never be an SR to build anytime
soon sr to build is coming just like the
health video but i had to have a holiday
don't lose hope it's coming it's coming
and when it comes I'm gonna make sure
that it's and it's worthy of being at
the sr to build itself because this is a
special motherboard is like one of the
Holy Grails of motherboards it's also
got 2 X 56 90s in it
do not worry I've actually got it right
here look I've been putting in a safe
spot this is not going anywhere soon
do not worry sr2 is here and next up we
got Marcus K says hi yes-men
what lavalier microphone are you using I
want to know because it sounds really
good
thanks a lot Marcus and it's the stony
edge lavalier microphone I use it and I
just plug it straight up into my camera
that you like the sound going into that
mic a lot of other people will use their
iPhones or external recording devices me
personally because I've got to do a lot
of videos and usually as a one-man band
I just have to save time any way
possible them because now I've got more
expensive camera gear the ADCs and the
amps on those cameras actually are
really good so I'm able to get away with
just plugging in Level II straight into
the camera now once I talk about mics
one thing is if you want to copy/paste
the mics I use just be aware that there
are different mics for different
people's voices for instance some people
might their voice might go well with a
harsh or a brighter mic some people's
voices might go well with a more deeper
mic and so I think the stonee lav mic is
more of a warmer that's the word I'm
looking for
warmer mic this mic here the MX LV 67 G
same thing it's a warmer mic and for
some reason I've looked over the last
couple of years what my audience like
and it seems to be that a warmer mic
with my voice is what the audience
prefer it's easier listening so once you
get used to what your audience likes
with that particular microphone then you
should match up with that microphone but
of course if you want a copypasta then
I'll put links in the description below
for you next up Eagles comments that
he's worried about wd-40 or water
dispersant not evaporating it does
evaporate and once it evaporates it
still looks better than when before you
applied it it just really gives it a
nice matte shine even though it does
look shiny and pretty initially after a
couple of days it just really looks good
next up Rickie Castro he States what
about to Zeon's x 56 75 in Ana's Usman
the board would you get better results
and Ricky unfortunately not really in
terms of everyday use as I comment
before with Unicron the reason I sold it
was because of those latency issues that
are introduced when you're using two
CPUs yes you're gonna get better scores
in a lot of benchmarks but in real-world
usage it's going to be slower and I
think you will notice it next up right
and says he has no clue what does turn
$900 in to $13.99 mean it means you go
out and you buy something for 900 bucks
you clean it up your adder one
terabyte hard drive in and then you sell
it for 1,400 so next up Vladimir Putin
says please don't use wd-40 just use ECC
and this goes back to those initial
questions again ECC is very expensive in
Australia and of course even if there
was ECC here I'd still use the water
dispersant in my eternal as the
finishing product next up we got a
comment from cheap chips which I've
never thought about before until I read
his comment that is how much of the
stuff that you buy do you expect is
stolen most of it or not a lot of it
honestly the answer to that is I've
never thought about the stuff being
stolen mind you if I do meet someone and
they are really sketchy on the phone or
their text messages don't check out and
they want to meet me somewhere in like a
really weird place I will turn down
meeting that person and so in the past I
have actually not met up with people due
to them just seeming fishy and dodgy
usually every single person I meet is
just normal I mean maybe that's just the
benefit of being in technology and every
person who sells me the stuff knows
what's inside it as well it's got an i7
or an i-5 I expect if someone was into
stealing this stuff they just wouldn't
have a clue what's in it and if that's
the case I'd be like hmm okay where are
you getting this stuff from but in terms
of what I bought in the past I expect
actually none of it to be stolen
next up Jamie Williams comments you got
4.6 gigahertz and 915 Center bench
points in this video I'll click the link
up here and here's is only getting 922
but he's got 4.8 gig arts what is going
on here basically you can optimize
windows oh
basically if you haven't checked already
I've got the windows 10 optimization got
up here it will improve your Cinebench
scores ever so slightly there is that
little difference as well as maybe your
overclock at 4.8 you guys might actually
not be a hundred percent stable so you
should be getting a slightly better
score than that and of course try to
overclock your memory if you can next up
here we've got Marcus well BMD he says
roll time stamp 153 done with this is
the wrong cooler mate I cannot stand to
watch so-called professionals use the
wrong cold plate with their
thread Ripper builds then some will
eventually get a proper Animax tr4
second-gen cooler or something like that
and then sabotages performances like
Hardware Canucks did just to not be
wrong about temps benchmarks and
overclocks
and finally overall performance well
Marcus a nice little insult there with
the so-called professional but just to
address your concerns you may have not
watched the video just before that where
we're calling down 32 cores and I
actually said that the NM axe lick tech
was the best out of those three coolers
I tested and I even said it in the build
that the lick tech does do a better job
the cooler master raise Ripper and also
the deep cool they performed behind the
NM acts tr4 lick tech the lick tech to
its credit is an amazing cooler that
does a really good job and I did watch
hardware kanakas video and I do disagree
with their results I think they need to
go back and retest and get some more
accurate numbers because they were not
anywhere near mine and I know for a fact
also the lick tech will beat out the
Corsair h100 I Pro especially on tier 4
because they've mounted a massive plate
on the bottom of that cooler and it
fully connects with the IHS on the
thread Ripper CPUs now this is the one
argument that I've been stating in the
past is why I use the spread method
because you get a full thermal paste
coverage and that is greater than the
difference that you're going to lose
from air bubbles Microsoft air bubbles
so yes the end of max tr4 lick tech is a
good cooler but for what it's worth we
use the corsair h 100 i pro because we
didn't use it on the 32 core comparison
and all those coolers in the 32 core
comparison did absolutely fine they
handled the cpu fine and that was a 32
core so the 16 core it was fine again
with the h 100 i pro so i'm not really
seeing what the big problem is here yes
the lick tech does perform better and i
did mention that in the video and that
about wraps things up and what's this
okay read this okay miscellaneous are
you aware that some of your videos are
being blocked in the US I can see them
if I use a VPN what okay really this is
the first time I've known about this
I've been getting all sorts of crazy
stuff happen
Wow okay so first off a lot of the
content has not been showing up in
people's subs feed that's like over the
past few months I've been getting a lot
of messages now this this is pretty
ridiculous I'm gonna tag at YouTube in
my videos as to why my content would be
getting blocked in the US that's very
bizarre yeah it sounds like it's been
going on for a while as well the fact
that he's had to log in for a VPN thank
you for bringing that to my attention I
will at YouTube this and see what I can
do about it min it's one thing if your
content and your content stale and it's
getting boring and it's getting dull and
whatnot but people are telling me they
love the deal Suns they love the content
coming out it's fresh
I've got use of Vaughn he's doing some
really fresh edits as well and I've got
no idea it's like can I just get a fair
chance to compete in the field of
YouTube I mean why do I have to get
nerfed and that sounds like it's a
nerfing on techy a city or a culling or
something anyway no idea guys if you've
got experiences like this be sure to
share them in the comments section below
but as always the hard work and the
grind it just continues it doesn't stop
and it's not going to stop it's an ethic
it's a code and a lot of you guys out
there share the same sentiments love you
all be sure to hit that like button if
you enjoyed this one if of course you
have comments be sure to drop in the
conversation below I'll read them if
they're most repetitive ones then I'll
answer them in the next address yes and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
