and also a 360 ml water cooling system
installed this case is far from the norm
so let's take a deep look at the deep
pool genome welcome back to tech es city
this is brand coming to you guys today
with a review of the deep cooled genome
and now I recently completed a build in
this case although it's not fully
finished and I'll talk about that later
I did manage to get a grasp of
everything that I like and don't like
about this case and now first things
first it comes in and around about 250
USD or if you're down under about 400
AUD and at that price it comes with the
pre-installed water cooling kit so
that's the main sale of this case though
is it worth the money
let's find out so first things first
with this case I love the open wide
window I mean I think that's definitely
a thing that's coming into the PC
enthusiast tech market where you want to
show off your hardware and even if
you're mounting it like I am on a desk
you'll be able to get it as a background
prop so kudos to do cool for getting
that right now another thing I do like
about this case is that bottom off
enclosure there for the power supply I
think it's a very neat thing to have
your power supply isolated from your
build where you've got those ugly cables
and then you can just put in extensions
and you've got a pretty good-looking
build they'll get on the thing that
definitely impressed me the most and
that was the side mounted GPU option
there so it comes with a 16 slot razor
cable there which you can extend to
their little game storm accessory there
and it just makes this build so much
different to normal builds in that you
can just sign mount a GPU and it looks
very different to your standard graphics
card in slot there so kudos to deep cool
I think if that's one thing that's going
to sell this case it's definitely the
side mounted option there even though I
did have some problem setting it up
initially and that's one thing that I
will critique about this case is that
the screw didn't go one of the screws
didn't go in properly there and also
when I'll side mounting the GPU these
screws had a tough time going in the
rear there and actually fitting the GPU
100% flush the moving along with the
build I like the fact that this is a mid
sized ATX case although it's just very
spacious inside and also that 360 mil
rat is just doesn't get in the way at
all it's also got three fans attached to
it and they're all white and black LED
themed fans the white LEDs on there they
also have it the rear there a black om
themed
found although for me I would have
personally like to have sinned deep cool
just add an additional game a storm fan
there at the back and for me personally
I replace this black fan with a white
and black game of storm fan that I had
around or if you're on a budget you
could probably pull out the third-most
further as fan on the radiator and just
swap that with the black one
taking a look behind the case say you've
got ample room for cable management
you've also got the option to mount some
SSDs on the back trays there and they'll
be completely out of sight out of mind
you've also got the hard drive cages
there which support two 3.5 inch drive
there and you've also got no option for
five point two five inch drive bays
there which is something that I
personally like being a hardware
enthusiast that has an external DVD
drive I don't really see the need for a
five point two five inch drive bay
though some people would need that and I
would like to point that out in this
review they're looking further on the
rear of this case you've also got that
big cut out there for CPU cooler
installation and also the edges on this
case were very blunt
nothing was sharp at all so you will not
find yourself cutting yourself in this
case at all moving on to the front of
the case you've got the ability to
detach the front there which will reveal
more of the radiator and give you the
option to mount some different
configurations that fans there whether
it be a 20 mil fan to 140 s or to 120
fans you can do that with this case you
can also mount a radiator there I
believe that to up to a 240 ml round on
the front if you wish to as well and
also on that now you can take off the
plastic grille on the top if you wish to
clean your radiator in the future also
on the top of the case there you've got
two USB 3 ports your power reset button
and your headphone and mic in Jack there
looking at the bottom of the case you've
also got a dust filter there for the
power supply which is easily removable
and you can clean that with these as
well you've also got four rubber feet
there which grip any surface really well
so now we've got the intricate out of
the way we can talk about the case
itself it comes in a white or black
configuration then you've also got the
option for a window or no side window
though I think the window is the best
choice with this case as it looks
absolutely gorgeous both on the outside
and on the inside though on that note I
did have some problems with screwing
some of these things in here like the
drive bays took me a little bit of a
tough time there to get some of those
screws in and also that graphics card at
the back when I wanted the side mount I
had a tough time again with some of
those screws I also found the
temperatures
the 360 ml water cooler itself to be
pretty mediocre of best and I've tested
a lot of coolers in the past found my
temperatures at 4.4 gigahertz on an X 99
system going all the way up to around
about eighty degrees in a pretty cool
environment of around about 24 degrees
besides that I can't really help but
like the build quality of this case and
the weight of this case it's not too
heavy but at the same time it's not too
light I can think of other case
manufacturers out there that make cases
that will literally leave you with a
hernia if you try to carry it anywhere
another thing I will talk about with
this case is the lighting of it that is
the white lighting that you see inside
this case is actually lit up from all
those gamers storm fans that I'm using
with the white LEDs on them
also the cooler that goes well that's
the block that goes onto the CPU does
have an LED on it itself and that does
have a breathing effect though I would
have liked to have seen that having all
on effect as well same with the radiator
on the front of the case that has only
the ability to have a white LED that
does this subtle breathing effect and
also as I said before I haven't actually
finished this build yet that's why it's
kind of like the cable management is
really ugly at the moment I'm actually
waiting on an 8-pin GPU power cable
there to finish off the build and also
I'm thinking of putting on the arctic
cooler on that 980ti to have that whole
white and black theme just stand out and
also overclock my GPU a little bit
better hopefully anyway that's about it
for me today guys if you like this video
be sure to hit that like button if you
have any questions or comments about
today's video or review on the deep cool
genome then be sure to drop a comment in
the comment section below and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can
also in a nutshell this case it is one
awesome looking unit definitely that
side mounted GPU is one of a kind I
think you're going to be seeing a lot
more of that definitely a deep cool
feature there from deep cool and I will
say that yeah there are some little
problems though if you watch the review
and you can get through them then it's
not such a big deal because the end
result is definitely worth it hey guys
hope you enjoyed the review and I'll
catch you in the next Tech video very
soon peace out for now bye
there's underwear in the b-roll it's a
rag it's really a rag hi there they've
all I I don't even know I knew that was
coming
welcome back to Tokyo City this is brian
coming to you guys today with a review
of the deep called genome which is deep
calls latest offering with their cases
in that they're pre-installed as a truck
huge truck came through people don't
understand the case reviews man they're
some of the toughest refused to do like
if you miss out one little thing and i'm
sure i missed out a few people are going
to kill you in the comments section so
i'm have already mentally prepared for
this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
