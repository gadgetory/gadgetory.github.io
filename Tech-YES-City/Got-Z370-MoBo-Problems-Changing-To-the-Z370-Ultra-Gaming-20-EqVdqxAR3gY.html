has a really bizarre problem and all of
this happened right before the GTX 690
testing so unfortunately for the GTX 690
s they may have got a pretty unfair
verdict and some of those blue screens
or even most of those blue screens could
have been because of this motherboard so
what happened right before I installed
the GTX 690 s was I was installing files
across to the NASS the tech yes NASA and
all the sudden my mouse just blew out
and I thought my mouse had died but then
on the screen I had noticed the file
transfer had just completely dropped out
as well
and the lights were still on for the
Nick as well so I was just really
confused at this stage and then once I
got the mouse into another USB port I
had found that the two sided drives
connected to the as media silo
controller they had blown out as well so
one positive thing that's going to come
out of this video is that in future
motherboard reviews I'm now going to
look at power delivery to individual
ports and components and see how that
motherboard is structured not only when
it comes to overclocking and audio and
all that other stuff but also power
delivery to individual components so
that's going to be the positive thing
that's coming out of this video but
we've now got this motherboard working
and how we got it working is we're just
running off the front two USB ports at
the moment disabled all the next
disabled all the rear USB ports and
disabled that Asmodeus SATA controller
and it's stable now and I know what some
people would probably think they
probably think it was the overclock and
know we've got this thing running at 5
gigahertz stable but just with the front
2 USB ports so it's a pretty crazy
problem but gigabyte did send over their
XIII 70 Horus board and they didn't want
me to take a look at it and they did
want me to civically overclocked it so
we're gonna see if we can get my 8700 K
higher than the stable 5 because
overclock I previously had and also on
that note while we wait for the
replacement for the fatality board to
come in from asrock I'm gonna take you
guys through a tour on this C 370 board
and see if it is any good see if it's
better than the previous C 370 that they
had with half the phases so let's get on
with this
okay so over there we've got that video
still rendering and over here we have
the front USB hub which is going to the
rear of the computer and now that is
powering my mouse and keyboard so that's
a pretty bizarre setup we've got and
then we've got the spare port here if I
need to connect a memory card or any
other device inside this case at the
moment though we have the 1070 TI
hall-of-fame and that's running really
well I love that graphics card so quiet
we've got the elgato capture card above
that but below that what I've done is
I've installed a 10 gig NIC this is the
Intel two-port
NIC I forgot the name of it that it's a
really decent one of course I got it on
sale for a real good bargain it was just
a tray icon and now one thing about tray
icons - guys tray just means that
there's no box so you just get the
product in whatever it is and it won't
have any retail packaging so tray can
usually be cheaper and it can usually be
a lot cheaper especially if that seller
is just wholesaling and out and wants to
get rid of it so what we're going to do
now is going to take all these
components out and then put this
motherboard in and then see how it will
fare under the Tek yes hammer
so now we're stress testing the CPU
we're over ten minutes into the test and
it's doing absolutely fine as five
gigabytes at one point four four volt
now I've tried booting up into Windows
at five point one and although it will
boot in as soon as I start a stress test
it just blue screens out so this CPU
I've got is just not capable at five
point one Giga now I would take it
higher except I believe the warping
point or the melting point of these CPUs
is over one point four five volt I
believe that's like the danger zone
anything over that you risk damaging
your CPU permanently and since we're
already getting it like ninety degrees
here we are reaching a pretty dangerous
point so we're at 25 degrees ambience so
the ambient temperatures are mediocre at
best but good news for the motherboard
is that the temperatures on the
motherboard BRM are actually really good
so that we're getting up to around about
65 degrees at the core of the base there
on the BRM and the heat sinks like in
the mid 50's
so gigabyte have definitely done a good
job on this Oris z3 70 gaming 2.0 so
they have said that they've implemented
a bit of erm and it's definitely showing
in these tests so I do like it when a
company takes feedback and then they
better that product and focus on what
the customer actually wants and I'll
just quickly stop this test and turn
these fans down because they are PWM
controlled and they are making a bit of
noise right much better
so now I got done running the SSD test
and I put it through a couple of tests
and the height of 64 SSD tests was
straight temperatures and we can see
that the top slot with the heatsink on
it that was doing about 11 degrees
better than the bottom SSD so that's
some really good news it's actually a
heat shield that works properly if you
guys have seen the msi boards in the
past they've just had this marketing
thing and it's actually made
temperatures worse this heatsink does a
good job of cooling down the SSD and
it's glad to see that they're following
suit like a zoo so Zeus was doing a heat
shield on at least the z3 17 bowls of
water I tested recently and that dropped
the nvme SSD champs down substantially
so they are following suit they are
getting it right and they have got it
right on this motherboard at leasts
so now we're just finishing up the last
component of this motherboard and this
is the onboard audio and now the
frequency response curve is really good
it's flat after 20 Hertz practically
throughout the whole range there before
20 Hertz you've got a point 2 decibel
drop-off until 10 Hertz and then before
10 Hertz you've got about a 2 decibel
drop-off so really good onboard audio
except the crosstalk is a real funny
thing this is how gigabyte have fixed
the problem that practically all the
other z3 70 motherboards have and I'll
put the link up here if you want to see
that comparison but above 90 volume
practically all these motherboards had a
problem where the crosstalk was either
leaking from the left channel to the
right channel or vice versa and this
time around gigabyte have decided they
could fix the problem by just lowering
the volume so we've got the volume set
to 100 but the problem is it's at least
6 decibels lower in its terms of its max
levels than all those other z3 70
motherboards are so gigabyte interesting
fix but I mean technically it's fixed
but it's a quick anyway the mic import
it's going to be really reliable if you
use it at that sweet spot of plus 20 DB
and 50 volume level going up to a
hundred at 20 DB will introduce a bit of
noise of course plus 30 DB at 100 you
can just see the noise just creeping and
I'll let you guys have a quick listen
though
anyway guys closing up now my new
editing rig has at least a temporary fix
and it's got the Auris motherboard in
there I'm sure as rock I'm gonna like
that but hey they got the mother would
sit in here and it didn't blow out a
whole power line and something else
crazy didn't happen but the ultra gaming
tunes not a bad motherboard they've
really worked on this board to make it
solid
you saw those SSD temperatures dropping
in the top slot I'd like to maybe see
that heatsink go to the bottom slot as
well if there was one thing I could
critique about this motherboard would be
the BIOS itself it is very detailed
that's a great thing but all the options
for overclocking your CPU they're like
all in different tabs I'd like to see
them kind of put all of them in the same
tab like the power limits and also load
line calibration and stuff like that if
they could put that in the same tab that
would be awesome but as it stands this
motherboard is really solid I think
comes in around 165 dollars at least
that's the rev one I'm hoping the rev 2
is the same price and of course you've
got that RGB bling-bling you can change
that in the bias as well so you don't
have to install the software and it
actually looks really nice the red
blinking off the white on the
hall-of-fame card I really like that so
it's giving me ideas to maybe make a
full white build with red are LED lights
I think that looked really cool anyway
ideas ideas lastly though it's getting
pretty late here so I'm gonna go to bed
very soon but tomorrow gotta fly up to
Thailand and I will be doing the use
parts hunt there this month and also I'm
going there for an event I can't say
which event it is but if you guys have
been reading up on rumors then you'll
probably know what it is already look
forward to giving you some awesome
coverage over there I'll be there for
two days but if you enjoyed this video
and be sure to hit that like button if
you've got any comments about the
motherboard if you want to see something
in Thailand or anything else drop a
comment
I love reading your thoughts and
opinions as always and I'll catch you in
another tape with your very serene peace
out for now bye
so good run Dunning now run Dunning
right there done running but anyway the
motherboard itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
