and what better to do then build a PC
full of used price-performance now
before it rains I'm gonna get on inside
and also make something that is just so
damn good because today is something
really special and why is it special
that's because I'm building a used
price-performance PC with some of the
most electrical deals money combined
these are some of these one-time deals
that I've picked up so if you guys are
looking for a deal that anyone can get
over the Internet then I'll put a link
up here for a recent bill that I did but
today's build is all my best deals from
the last few months that I'm putting
together to make not only just a gaming
PC but also a whole setup with mouse
keyboard and monitor included without
aside let's go into the studio
check out the paths that we're going to
put into this build and how much I've
paid for them before I get drenched out
here on this stormy Sunday
so here's all these components here on
the desk we're gonna go through each of
them quickly and explain how I got them
either so cheap or in this case for
instance the mouse and keyboard for free
now I won this at a competition at IEM
when I guess some jelly beans in a jar
and I got it right on the correct amount
where I guessed 889 and I'll shocked
because I've never won anything in my
life
so this was the first thing that I
wanted I was over the moon next up here
we had a gtx 1070 where it's a faulty
graphics card that got given to me and
when I was in Taiwan I took it to the
Taiwan service repair center and they
fixed it completely free I'll put the
link to that video up here if you
haven't seen it and then we've got over
here a 120 gigabyte SSD I actually
bought this brand new 28 Aussie dollars
or about 19 USD then we've got a 1.5
terabyte hard drive I got this from the
same person that I got this PC right
here which is an i7 4770k us also got a
cooler a gigabytes of RAM then we've got
an adapter and we got this monitor as
well 22 inch Samsung monitor now these
are really good because you can get
these for cheap in the case of this
monitor right here I picked it up for
$40 are about 28 US dollars which makes
it just the nominal value for money for
getting into 1080p gaming now of course
the 10-7 is going to be able to provide
really good frame rates but the last
piece of this puzzle here is this MB 520
Coolermaster case it's got three RGB
fans at the front and now how I picked
this up was that someone was selling it
for 50 Ozzie dollars and I asked him
exactly why they were selling it and
they said they're getting an NZXT case
so me picking this thing up for about 34
USD with the RGB bling the tempered
glass is definitely a bargain on my
behalf now telling up all the parts on
the table here at least what I paid for
them and I know this is not realistic of
what you're going to get if you're
looking on eBay or over the Internet I
paid a hundred and seventy four USD for
this whole set up here and also if
you're in Australia comes out to about
250 to Aussie dollars but without a side
let's put this whole PC together and
then clean this whole set up and give it
some check yes loving and then check out
the performance and what I believe is
going to be my
best price performance to this date now
we're gonna stop and pause on this OAM
right here we've got a legit Windows 10
license included we've got an i7 4770k
Kohler motherboard a gigabytes of RAM
now had no drives in it and that's why
the person who sold it to me was selling
it so cheap and this is one of those
cases of the person not knowing that in
this case 110 Aussie dollars is pretty
much what someone would pay for an i7
4770k extra components in this build
included is just an absolute steal now
you're not really gonna go find this on
the internet because the moment someone
lists something like this for this cheap
and they don't know what it's worth
someone else is gonna snap it up in a
heartbeat so I guess a lot of times with
the local deals it's just about being at
the right place at the right time with
of course the cash in hand
so here's the build it is all complete
and the good news is everything is up
and running absolutely fine now the
magic in this build is coming from the
i7 4770k that was released in 2013 has 4
cores 8 threads but interestingly enough
this CPU is still actually quite popular
and in demand on the used market it
still fetches well over a hundred ozzie
dollars or in USD terms well over 70 USD
and at these prices it does leave one
wondering why is a six year old CPU
commanding such a premium to this date
and it's got to do a two major factors
the first being of course it carries
that i7 moniker which when people buy a
PC and they see I seven in it they
definitely think oh this PC is going to
be awesome no matter what the second
thing is it actually carries all the
latest instruction sets even including
the avx2 which makes the CPU still in
2019 extremely relevant but the main
question still remains and that is how
well will this set up perform in games
with the gtx 1070 let's put it to the
test
so we just finished playing apex legends
on this use price performance setup and
the i7 4770k numbers at 1080p of 108
average FPS 76 1% low and 24.1% low
though the results differ of course
depending on what part of the map you're
on now another thing about this monitor
is actually a 1650 by 1050 16 by 10
resolution so I'm actually not
benchmarking this particular monitor as
the FPS will be even higher we actually
set it up over the test rig over there
and we're getting the 1080p numbers for
you guys but let's jump into pop G now
and see how this PC performs in that
particular title
we just finished up playing pub G and
the 1080p ultra results were pretty
impressive we're getting over a hundred
average FPS but the one percent lows
were good - that was 56
however the 17 of 0.1% Lowe was getting
a little bit low and there was some
stuttering at 1650 when I was playing on
this particular monitor here where the
point on % lowers were clearly coming
out onto 10 and of course that's that
level where it can start to be
noticeable and it can affect your
performance especially in a clutch
situation but I here with pub G this is
a little bit of a unique outlier since
I'm living in Oceania and apparently
they've removed these servers and I
noticed when I was trying to get some
frags that I my bullets just weren't
hitting at all so a little bit of a
weird problem with pub G I mean the game
is running ok but also another thing I'm
not too sure of with this rig since the
dual channel memory is only at 1333
megahertz perhaps that could be a
problem with this particular title but
we've also overclocked the graphics card
- and the temperatures are good but
we'll talk about that after we run the
last benchmark here which is GTA 5
so there's gta5 done and now a funny
thing about this versus pub G is I'm
playing in single-player mode and the
FPS is so incredibly smooth in this
title and it's a CPU intense title just
like pub gears apex legends ran really
smooth and so did GTA 5 so I'm going to
call pub G a bit of an outlier in that I
believe it has other issues inherent to
things like these servers which is
causing the stuttering and causing the
game not to play that well but in terms
of the performance and how this rig
performed especially for the money and
what I paid for it we're gonna sit down
and talk about this a little bit more in
depth and there it is with the under
$200 gaming setup now of course these
prices in this build are unrealistic you
can't really go out and expect to get a
free gtx 1070 but of course over the
last three months I've been hustling
some really good deals and some of the
time I just get those extraordinary
deals that are like outside three
standard deviations so there's kind of
build here today I'd call it the anomaly
setup because it's not realistic but at
the same time you guys love it when I
put together all these cookie cutter
builds and this one is just the epitome
of price performance in terms of what
I've done personally but at the same
time there's some other factors involved
with this PC that make it a really good
balance for instance even though it's
only got a gigabytes of ddr3 that held
up fine in these three titles and that's
still with the MSI Afterburner overlay
recording all the FPS figures if there's
one thing though I would do to this PC
it'd be to upgrade that eight gigabytes
to 16 gigabytes which I'll probably do
if I'm gonna flip this PC also the gtx
1070 that thing is absolutely fine it's
actually more than fine for 1080p ultra
gaming I'll surprised at how well it's
holding up in these titles with just
giving really smooth FPS and especially
coupled with that forty seven seventy
it's got all the latest instruction sets
despite of being a CPU that's basically
six years old it can still get up and
boogie and play games apps
fine now another thing we didn't talk
about is the fact that it's got that
onboard HD graphics which you can then
use if you're streaming for example or
doing other things in Adobe Premiere Pro
so if you've got this with 16 gigabytes
of RAM you could double down as a 1080p
video editing rig absolutely no problems
now in terms of power consumption here's
another surprising thing when I
overclocked the grantors card where the
core clock was getting around 2.0 5
gigahertz and the memory I got an extra
about roughly 500 which I think on
NVIDIA is doubled to about an extra
gigahertz on the memory the performance
was really good and the power
consumption was only going up to about
270 watts max draw or at least that's
what I saw on the water meter when
running the heaven benchmark now the
other really good thing about this build
is the temperatures - I saw a maximum on
the CPU of 72 degrees and this is in a
25 C ambient environment and this was
whilst playing GTA 5 I also saw the GPU
was basically staying under 60 degrees
the whole time which means a couple of
things it means the cool that gigabyte
have put on this thing
is more than fine of keeping this thing
under control when it's overclocked and
that was it a static fan speed of 70%
which really didn't give out any noise
at all inside this case and here's
another thing that went really well with
this build and that's the cooler master
case we used here today those three fans
at the front there not just for bling
they actually provide really good
cooling especially with that outtake fan
so the four fans included on this case
despite it having tempered glass despite
having an enclosed front it did have
those mesh sides which were able to draw
the air in effectively and keep this
whole build very cool in what would be
considered mediocre temperatures but the
last thing I wanted to talk about was
gaming on 22 and 24 inch monitors just
like the pro gamers really prefer these
sizes of monitors I think it's actually
a really enjoyable experience playing on
a smaller monitor I headed on 32 inch 4k
monitors and when I got back from
holidays Casals overseas editing on 24
inch monitors for Computex and over in
LA I was using a TV I got back home and
I was kind of surprised at just how big
two inch monitors are and in fact I
think they're too big for gaming
personally I think they're good for 4k
video editing where you've got a lot of
real estate especially at 4k but for
gaming 22 or 24 inch monitors definitely
shouldn't be ignored even if you want
the best gaming experience I know those
Ultra wines are very tempting they do
command a price premium but I could
really enjoy myself on a smaller monitor
especially coupled with used hardware
and I guess in closing that's the crux
of this whole video is putting together
something really good for price
performance but also appreciating how
good that price performance really is in
the fact that I could get this set up
here stop doing 4k video editing and I
could really enjoy myself on something
that I've put together here today in
this video if you've got that friend
who's got that high refresh rate 4k
monitor he's paid $3,000 for you got
that other friend who has a 21 by 9
ultra wide bling monitor and you're on
your 22 inch monitor and they're talking
down to you you can just tell the tech
yes sends his regards because this
sector of the market is booming like
it's never been booming before and I've
actually got some insight news for you
guys
while speaking to some analysts and
journalists over at LA for the AMD event
and they were telling me some of the
articles with use price performance with
some of their biggest articles so far in
2019 only being surpassed by that of the
Zen 2 announcement which was really cool
to hear so you guys keep hitting that
like button for us keep reppin used
price performance in the comments
section below and if you're enjoying the
content enough then you may wish to hit
that sub button click that Bell
notification because I got a lot more
used price-performance coming to your
sub boxes in the next few months so stay
tuned for that but also on that note let
us know in the comments section below
what do you think about monitor sizes
and what is your best gaming experience
not just for enjoying the games but also
for a competitive player I find me
personally I actually play the best on a
23 inch monitor 1080p when I'm playing
competitively but your mileage may vary
love reading your thoughts and opinions
as always and I'll catch you in the next
Tech video very soon peace out for now
bye
are you gaming at 4k 120 Hertz like dude
I'm gaming on a 2012 22 inch Samsung
monitor get on my level
