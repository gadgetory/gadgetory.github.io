you just coming back to you guys today
with the last review on audio okay so
these this this here is a USB 2 audio
interface device it is the tax can us to
hundreds now this can be had for about
130 dollars and a good thing about this
is guys is that it has 24-bit 96k low
Hertz in and out of ADCs and DACs on
board so it's going to process that
signal for you and then it's going to
send it to your computer via USB ok so
let's have a look first off the box is
pretty well packaged you know I can't it
looks good the box looks good and it has
a little bit of explanation on what it
comes with now it comes with a USB cable
and it comes with your CDs and you you
Cubase le 5 so this is the unit itself
though let's have a look at the main
unit itself this is the reason why you
guys are probably here this thing here
is pretty well I like the feel of it
it's got rubber feet on the bottom there
it's pretty well constructed it's a hard
plastic so it feels really sturdy it is
pretty light and I will say that I like
it better than the m-audio FastTrack it
feels better it's bigger and you know
looks it looks a lot better to the
m-audio is really small it's probably
about this is this size here so the end
of audio is a really small unit this is
a lot bigger now let's have one of the
features on what you get to you guys so
basically this is Teac the brand's Teac
and now you get here you've got the
headphones level so you can plug your
headphones directly into this so I'll
show you here so you can plug the
headphones straight in there guys and
then you can thanks to directly control
the headphones with these the level here
they're not so you do that try a stereo
jack and if you don't have one you can
get them for pretty cheap as they plug
that in you can directly control that's
pretty good the level if you go to max
guys it is definitely loud enough if you
know I usually leave it about here as
Max tends to be too loud for me so
anyway guys this here's the next feature
I want to talk about and that's the more
you know the main mix or the you know
the mono mix or whatever they call it
but resolute to the right is input so if
you
on the right guys it'll basically get
the signal from your computer so you can
listen to your headphones from your
computer and if you move it all the way
to the right it'll give you the direct
feedback from the unit itself before it
goes the computer and I think it's a
pretty stupid thing to have a knob for
this I don't understand why they didn't
just have a switch to have you know unit
but earth or computer so if you if
you've never for instance if you knew
that he asked it'll get a bit of a bit
of feedback from here and then it'll
obviously get the rest of it from this
computer so sort of like mixes it's
pretty stupid I think it's a stupid idea
but anyway that's not to worry it works
so if you put in the right computer left
direct you know direct listening from
new device now it's got a 48 volt
phantom power on both these lines here
you guys and we'll let you know here
with the switch whether it's on or off
so very good very easy to use and USB so
let you know when it's connected to the
USB device by this light bezel it's the
on button yeah so that does run off USB
power that that's how it works
so hey guys the next thing here is the
signal line number one so line number
one guys it has the signal so to let you
know when it's connected and working and
I mean sorry let you know when you when
you speak into the microphone for
example this signal line up saying hey
we're getting the signal it's working
this will be the clipping so the red
will say hey it's clipping now you've
got to turn it down a little bit so it
basically tell you when it's distorting
so basically the problem I had with this
guys and I don't know if anyone else is
having this problem but I think I'm
gonna have to get a track change is that
this 2 unit pacifically guys when I turn
this up to max it has this annoying
buzzing sound and it doesn't exist on
line number two it only exists on line
number one I turn it to max it will have
this annoying buzzing sound and only
when the phantom power is on so
basically goes with this and the I you
know I had another problem with the
m-audio fast track and that it just
didn't work on skype and you know I'm on
Windows services a little bit the
drivers on the m-audio didn't work the
m-audio was crystal clear this the
drivers work
well but the problem I'm having is just
this you know I want if I pay 140 bucks
per sign under 30 bucks I want it to
work properly and so this is the one
problem I'm having at the moment is this
little noise here so I'm going to get it
try to get exchange for another unit and
see how that goes anyway not to worry
this is the line number two works but
the problem is is that line number one
is the default input so if you're using
Skype or be calling someone or you
you're talking on Google hangout line
number one's going to be the default
channels for that so if you're online
them trees no one's gonna hear anything
so that's why the line number ones it's
so important so hey guys why Samba 2 is
the same thing it works perfectly
so line number one obviously you've got
the option there of changing it from a
microphone to an instrument okay so
you've got the option there and now the
next week's case you've got is mono and
stereo so it'll change the channels to
mono or stereo depending on this switch
here so it's good if you're using
microphones you just change the mono and
will give you mono signals so a very
good feature guys overall it is packed
with good features it is a solid unit it
has a lot of features on it goes the
audio on number two is crystal-clear so
I just think I've got a bad unit and
obviously going to exchanges and see how
user number 2 goes and then I'll get
back to you guys but anyway let's do a
little audio test on line number 2 so
you can see how clear this thing sounds
and obviously guys if you've got any
questions about this unit pacifically
please let me know this will be the last
of my reviews on audio tech and you know
because I sort of I had you know I
realize that onboard audio has this week
amplification and I've I've been on this
quest to fix it so I've got this in the
process and this thing is really good
except I just got this problem here on
line number one so anyways if you have
any questions about this unit please
leave them in the comment section below
I'll get back to you as soon as I can
and obviously if you got any clip any
other things you want to know please let
me know and I'll get back to you as soon
as I can hope you enjoyed this review
today guys and peace out for now Brady's
yep from now on through the next you
know me I'll just endure quick tests as
you know let you guys know how clear the
microphone is so this will be on line
number one number two since line number
one has this weird buzzing noise so hope
you enjoy the test guys and peace out
for now wait
okay guys so this is a quality test on
the US 200 tascam so I'm using a bearing
of b1 and ya guys hopefully it sounds
good the volumes on about might say
about four-fifths of the way up so it's
pretty loud like the actual input knob
is turned up pretty loud so hopefully it
sounds really good as it should be for a
hundred and thirty dollar unit so yeah
guys I hope you enjoyed this review and
if you have any questions please let me
know in the comment section below peace
out for now
