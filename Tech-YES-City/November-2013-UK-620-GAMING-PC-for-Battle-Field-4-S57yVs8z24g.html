coming back to you guys in the UK with a
six hundred and twenty pound budget bill
now this is a battlefield for optimized
pc gaming machine but it won't just play
battlefield 4 well it'll play pretty
much any other game really well so
without further ado let's get on with
the budget build sir the first part of
the build is the i5 4 430 now this is a
great CPU for the money it's actually
sort of hid behind the the ranks
everyone's been recommending the 335 70
Cal the 4670k but when this thing goes
out this cheap you can really put
together a really nice gaming rig
because a you're not going to need a
more expensive motherboard be you're not
going to have to put an aftermarket cpu
cooler on it and see well you're saving
like a heap of money compared to the for
670 case are you saving a lot of money
when you go with this option and
honestly it's not that bad i mean the
thing will turbo up to I think 3.4 if
you know what you're tweaking I think
you get an extra 400 megahertz out of
them so then go up to 3.4 gig and they
really run well these speeds are really
pretty much destroy any game on a single
GPU will especially the GPU were putting
it today so anyway great CPU for the
money hundred forty pounds it's a fork
or it's a really it's good saves a lot
more like it'll save a bit more money on
power than it would on the FX 6300 as
well over time so keep that in mind now
the next part bill is a western digital
one terabyte blue staple item that
usually goes in a lot of my budget
builds if you want more reliability go
with the western digital black if you
want to go with an SSD then maybe go buy
a 120gb SSD for an extra I don't know 50
or 60 pounds so that's up to you guys as
well I would recommend an SSD if you
have that little bit of extra money
they're going to make your whole
experience amazing as well next part of
the build is the asrock h87 pro for
motherboard now this is a full sized ATX
motherboard which is why I like it I
actually think it's a little bit thin
though it's actually not full sized ATX
sorry I think it's a little bit cut off
here so but the thing is this features
really it has really good features on it
it's got the I think it's got the Intel
and I see I think on board but it's got
a realtek alc 892 onboard audio codec
which is really decent for the money not
to mention it's got four ram slots
if you want to put in an extra ram in
the future you can as well as it's got
six side of three ports there as well so
a really nice featured board it's also
got a little heat sink on there just to
keeping things cool and make this board
look decent so i really like weathers
boards priced at and I really like the
features that it comes with so next part
of the build is the crucial ballistix so
now as you guys know Rams expensive this
isn't the best value for money that I've
seen on RAM but it's not the worst
either so you're getting good nice heat
sinks on these on this ramp it'll be
able to overclock in my opinion to 1866
if you want it to but on as well I
really don't really see that I don't see
the need to pretty much any game runs
fine at cl9 1600 speed memory there's
not much to have a difference if any in
it in most of the games you're going to
play now this Ram is just really good so
yeah really good value for money not
really good value for money but decent
value for money considering the other
Ram that's out there and the prices of
other Ram now the next part of the build
is the vtx3d so raid on 79 70 now this
thing is cheaper than pretty much any r9
280x out there it's the same thing as
the r9 280x except it's just you know
the 7970 so if you guys want to go with
the r9 280x then maybe in my opinion the
sort of that one of the best buyers
would be the Sapphire for 240 pounds
there's only one of these left in stock
so I believe it will sell out really
soon so you know if this thing's sold
out and go get the sapphire which is
really good version it's a really good
version as well now battlefield 4 is
optimized for AMD it's optimized mainly
for the graphics cards however I'm not
from the benchmarks and especially on my
nvidia gtx 670 the game runs absolutely
the right runs like butter so I don't
think it doesn't matter so much with
that'll feel for what graphics card you
go with however keep in mind that mantle
will be out in December so it's up to
you guys if you're really if you're just
playing battlefield 4 and that's your
sole purpose then definitely go with an
AMD graphics card now this are 220
pounds is phenomenal value for money
it's really is really good value for
money so I like with this card's price
that it looks good it'll play games
amazingly well not to mention you
probably had to get a good overclock out
of it as well so I really like that case
now that
on the sorry that graphics card now the
next part of the build sorry but before
we go into this part of the build i will
want to say that if you want to go off
the green this is extraordinarily good
value for money as well I'll surprised
when I saw this for 240 pounds so
considering you know graphics cards are
generally a bit more expensive in the UK
this thing if you guys want to go out
the green then this is a really good
solution as well this is what I'd
probably buy personally because you know
shadow play is really damn good recently
I started recording games on shadow play
it doesn't drop any frames it's really
smooth it records you know 1080p at 60
frames per second or 30 frames per
second and in different records at 60
frames per second the file sizes are
really small as well so if you guys are
serious about streaming on a budget then
you may wish to go with the gtx 770
because this thing is really good it's
probably you know in a lot of the games
it'll be same as the 7970 you know but
battlefield 4 the seven 970 will be a
better choice so it's up to you guys but
yeah personally I'd go with this card
because you know it just looks awesome
as well I love that black all black
heatsink now pull it especially have
lifted their game the GD x 6 series cars
that they brought out I wasn't to
impress with them but the GD x 7 series
cards they're bringing out are pretty
good so this is a good example of a good
buy if you guys want to go with the
green so anyway let's move on now to the
case so let's get back to the case here
an arrow strike aerocool sorry arrow
struck I just called the arrow straight
cool X or the arrow called strike acts
so this is a screwless mid tower gaming
case now it just looks really good i
mean it looks nice it's a nice case if
we zoom in here we can see that it's got
the power button and reset button at the
top USB and audio up the top there it
looks pretty cool as well got a lot of
ventilation options as well if you wish
to install fans in the future also going
inside the case here you've got that
extended area there so if you want to
put that graphics card in that like
stroll on graphics card which the 79 70
is pretty damn long then it will fit in
this case no problems as well you got a
lot of bays here for hard drives and DVD
drives you also got the cut out here if
you wish to install a new motherboard in
the future with a cpu cooler so really
good case here from eric
arrow strike aerocool I've got an arrow
cool case at the moment sad that I can't
even I get confused with the naming of
it but anyway I've got an arrow cool
case at the moment and they're not bad
they good value for money that's all I'm
going to say with Eric cool they good
value for money and since this is a
budget build kind of you know your value
is what we want so Eric will definitely
deliver on budget and value for money so
next player built is the ocz 550 watt 80
plus bronze power supply now 441 pounds
this is a great solid power supply it'll
power everything in this build
absolutely fine and then some really
good if you guys wish to and you're
serious about us are lying in the future
or you want a power supply that'll last
you you know I mean if you want to use a
power supply and you want to answer lie
in the future then maybe go out the 750
watt and then you have support for two
graphics cards in the future probably
personally that's what I'd probably go
pay the extra 20 pounds because you know
then you get like it says here you get
that crossfire or that SLI going in the
future and you won't have to worry about
buying another power supply so really
cool there goodbye but 441 pounds if you
just want to go with a single graphics
card which is usually the best option
than 41 pounds is all you need to spend
now last part of the build is the
Samsung 24 speed DVD burner these things
you know if you have one then just use
it save yourself 14 pounds but if you
don't have one then you're most likely
going to need it for a nice install so
there you go and backing up whatever
files you want to now that leaves the
total price of the bill to 621 pounds
and forty six pence now as I was saying
before if you can find these parts
elsewhere for cheaper then go do so save
yourself some cash fellas don't you
don't have to buy these older carts in
this particular all the items in this
particular car this is just a guide as
to what I'd buy for around this price
range anyway I hope you guys enjoyed
this build if you did please give it a
thumbs up and if you have something
urgent and please PM me as I'm saying
before the new YouTube comments is just
 it's got a control it's it's gone
crazy the YouTube comments section now
so I'm not even receiving messages for
comments but I am getting PMS OPM's is
still fine you guys peace out for now
I'll catch you guys I'm going to be
doing in Australia build soon so I'll
get that out when I can
and I'll catch you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
