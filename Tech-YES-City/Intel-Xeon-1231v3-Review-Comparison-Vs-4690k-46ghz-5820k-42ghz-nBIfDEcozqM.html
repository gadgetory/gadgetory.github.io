12/31 beat 3 so this is the Haswell
refresh of the Xeon CPUs welcome back to
take s it is Barak I'm about you guys
today with a quick review of the xeon
1231 v3 now this review is going to be
more focused on using this cpu for the
end home user that is someone who's
going to use it in a workstation a
gaming pc and or both maybe suitably i
recently built this rig in the
background that I did a whole build
guide using this CPU for a hybrid gaming
workstation and it performed really well
and so we're going to quickly go through
what you get in the box then we'll run
some quick benchmarks against the 4 670
K because that's basic it's mainly I
think that's the main competition that
is just going up against and then I'll
do a quick conclusion and rundown for
you guys so the xeon 1231 v3 is
essentially a refresh of the Haswell
CPUs that they decided to do because of
the delays in Broadwell now specifically
with this cpu you essentially get a base
clock of 3.4 gigs which is a hundred
megahertz higher than the previous gen
1230 v3 also the turbo clock enables us
to go up to three point eight gigs on
two cores and 3.6 gig on all-cause
though if you've got the right BIOS on
the right motherboard I'm pacifically
pointing to this b85 pro gamer here
you'll be able to get this thing up to
three point eight gigs on all-cause now
unfortunately for me it doesn't go any
higher because there's no option to up
the B clock
I think that's disabled on most be 85
and h87 boards I think you need
civically AKC PU to unlock that feature
which is a little bit disappointing
because I like to extract as an
enthusiast the most value I can out of
my products and I certainly know that
this thing running at 3.8 gigs at point
nine nine volts is certainly able to get
up to four gigahertz at the very least
with a 105 megahertz speed on the base
clock however let's talk about also the
product essentially you're getting a CPU
with eight megabytes of level-3 money on
board
a little bit more than the four 670 K so
in the box you get the CPU which comes
packaged just like any other CPU you get
the manual with a three year warranty
and more it most interestingly enough
you get a the better variant of the two
head sinks that in telling with the four
cores so this one has the copper base
plates a little bit heavier than the
cheaper variant you also get the better
fan as well so the Xeon actually has a
better fan then the i7 and the i5 and
the i3 variants and the Pentiums as well
so that's a good thing if you are going
to just use the stock cooling on this
arm CPU like I've done in my rig in the
background here so with this CPU as well
you also get some features that are
enabled and disabled compared to the
desktop variants though for the end home
user and the average game of the average
person doing workstation applications is
not going to make a difference at all
it's more for an enterprise or a large
business that needs to worry about these
features that's about it for the actual
hardware side of things with the CPU you
guys are probably wondering how it
performs in the benchmarks so I'll just
run through some quick benchmarks for
you guys and you can see how it goes
against the four 670 K at 4.6 gigs
so in conclusion what can I say about
the 1231 v3 CPU from Intel well a lot of
good besides the initial expensive face
value of this CPU so this thing will run
you up around about $250 or more however
besides that the CPU in my opinion just
synergizes the best out of any Intel
Haswell CPU out there you can couple it
with a cheap b85 motherboard get it to
three point eight gigs
on the stock heatsink fan and then get
some cheap ddr3 memory and you're good
to go you're going to be doing
workstation applications absolutely fine
you're going to be gaming absolutely
fine and you're going to get that low
power consumption which is going to keep
temperatures down in your rig as well as
in your actual house as well and it's
going to keep little bit of savings on
the power bill now that depends on where
you live and I have been criticized
about saying I should stop talking about
power savings but I can't because I pay
like thirty five cents a kilowatt-hour
and it actually adds up for me
so CPU like this has a lot of benefits
and not a lot of disadvantages now I
will say one thing and that is who's
this for essentially it's for someone
who is just looking for a really
balanced CPU for the money how does it
compare against the 467 TK well in ARMA
3 it doesn't do as well in planetside 2
it doesn't do as well however in those
multi-threaded games it does edge out
the 46 70 K at 4.6 gigs which was an
impressive feature with the CPU and then
when it came to workstation applications
it again edged out the 4 670 K whilst
using a lot less power not requiring a
z97 or z87 motherboard and also using
less power than the 4 670 K so
ultimately it does get my approval if
you're looking for a better variant of
the 4 670 K now its benefits as well
it's also doesn't and one thing to
mention I forgot to mention the review
as well it doesn't have the onboard HD
graphics are enabled on this particular
CPU so you will not be able to
quick sink as well as not having a
graphics card option there if you're not
using a main graphics card say for
instance your graphics card is faulty
and you need to send it back and you
need to use a rig in the meantime that
HD graphics can come in handy they'll
benefit of not having an onboard is
you're using slightly less power again
because it's just completely disabled so
that's what the HD grab is quick sync
though is I hear it's gaining a lot of
traffic traction for streaming so if
you're a streamer than you may wish to
look at the for 790 ko2 for 770 or for
790 because they have the HD graphics
which will enable you to use Quick Sync
so now's the big question should you get
this or should you get the FX 8320 or
should you get the 467 TK and that
depends on what you're looking for if
you're looking for the best performance
on those CPU intensive games at a
predominantly single-threaded planetside
2 comes to mind also ARMA 3 comes to
mind then you're probably going to want
to get a 460 70 K and overclock the
living out of it but if you're
looking for something that's and you're
on a real budget and you're doing work
stable work station applications then
you may wish to get an FX 8320 for a
hundred or 120 dollars get it on a cheap
motherboard and utilize those eight
cores
though if you're looking for something
that sort of is the jack of all trades
master of none except for performance
per what it is the master of that then
you're looking at the 1231 v3 it's a
good CPU that does gaming really well
it's a good CPU that does workstation
applications really well and it all does
that whilst using the least amount of
power possible so I do like this CPU and
I do like where it's at especially for
someone like me so it depends on who you
are at the end of the day I also like
being a little bit different not
everyone's using a Xeon especially on a
b85 motherboard so I kind of like where
the CPU is at the moment I would like to
see it a little bit cheaper possibly
that's always a great thing and I would
like to see Intel enable B clock over or
base clock overclocking on this so I can
get a little bit more performance out of
this CPU that'd be a great feature to
have and I'd like to see them
do that especially since they have been
doing some good things with the 5820k
and the 32:58
so I just like to see them enable B
clock overclock I mean there's pretty
much no reason not to enable that people
know what it is they know the feature
they know it can be dangerous so just
enable that please give us enthusiasts a
chance to get a bit more performance out
of this thing so now guys that's about
it for the 1231 v3 I hope you enjoyed
this review if you did please give it a
thumbs up if you have any questions
about the 1231 v3 then leave a comment
the comment section below another thing
to mention too is if you're getting this
motherboard there's only one revision of
the BIOS that will work to get it to 3.8
gigs it's the first boss released I've
tested all the other biases out and they
don't get it to 3.8 gigs so that's
something you might want to think about
as well maybe if you've got to be 85
motherboard only one particular biased
revision will be able to get it up to
three point eight gigs and hey it's an
extra two hundred megahertz of
performance so you deserve it anyway
guys that's about it I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
