the dark coming back to you guys today
with not a review of this TV but a
review of this little guy over here the
Zalman z3 Plus which is a mid-tower ATX
sized case now also this big screen here
I'm going to be getting the overclocking
tutorial done for you guys on the AMD FX
CPU so that will be coming soon as well
I'm also going to be getting a review
done of this CPU cooler but without
further ado let's get on with the review
today of the sound and z3 plus case
today we have the Salomon z3 plus
edition which differs from the z3 and
then it has a mirror here and it has USB
3 and a fan switch button and so today
this case is only 40 dollars might add
so today I'm going to be reviewing this
case for you guys telling you all the
ins and outs of this case and also you
probably wondering the format's a little
bit different yes this is going to be my
work PC and I'm also going to quickly
showcase this PC at the end of this
video for you guys and the audio might
be bad as well so sorry about that I'm
just recording off my EOS digital camera
so anyway without further ado let's go
into the review of this case now I'll
get the negatives damaged straight away
because there's not many negatives about
this case first of all first negative is
that these clips at the back once you
take them out you cannot put them back
in so unless you're welcome so that's
the first little negative I could only
find in this case the next is the paint
here actually differs slightly from the
top to the rest of the case it's a
slightly different white so it may annoy
some of those people who are very picky
about things and also the next negative
that I could only find is generally the
space of the case it's not that big
however that can be a positive as well
in people who want small cases I just
found with something like a GTX 670 big
fan like this the CP NS 14 and a 651
pounds but there wasn't that much space
to move around especially with the cable
management so that is a little negative
for me but personally since this case is
so small and it only weighs 6 kilograms
I see that as being a positive as well
okay ultimately cable management was
fine and we will take
the side panel soon to show you guys
what's inside this rig the next positive
is and the next negative is well the
last little negative is of this fan
switch button it literally just doesn't
work I don't really notice a difference
much between the fan speeds when I hit
this on and I hit this off it just
doesn't do anything the fan speeds don't
really change they just stay the same
speed all right let's get on with the
positives because there are a lot of
positives about this cases okay so now
moving on to the case itself there's a
lot of positives to talk about with this
case so let's look at firstly the build
quality of the case and the aesthetics
this thing this case looks absolutely
phenomenal for 40 dollars
I really fell in love with the Artic
white on this case as well as the
included 120 millimeter fan at the front
which lights up blue so the design and
the build quality of this case
definitely impress me everything on this
case there's no sharp edges at all so
salmon have really paid attention to
making sure that even a person say with
diabetes and thin skin on their hands
one cut themselves so I really like that
there's no there's no sharp edges the
build quality is really good I also like
the fact that this case has very easy I
say I'll show you up here very easy
support for installing hard drives so
you just put these two clips here on my
hard drive and you can slot it in and
out I'm not actually going to do it
because the hard drive is already it's
working at the moment this here comes
out with relatively relative ease but it
also at the same time feels solid so put
in and that will install your 5.25 drain
and drive base you'll also see here that
there's a cutout here for an SSD as well
which really impressed me because this
this case ultimately it's just get up
towards the game up we've also got here
this cutout here which is an intuitive
design which will run over for a two
slot cooler to slide as you can see here
to slot this and one thing to notice is
that this motherboard is actually a
little bit further down than what's
usual this is the
and the 990 fxg d65 motherboard it's
usually a little bit up so this card
would run an extended card wouldn't
Ryland absolutely fine you could fit any
graphics card that I can think of would
fit in this a 290x at 2:19 a 780ti would
you want to fit two of these I would say
no because this is only a GTX 670 and
it's already coming out hitting it
further than this metal bracket here so
if you want to go with SLI I would
recommend it only for two mid-range
cards so two gtx 760 s or maybe two
reference 777 okay but anything like a
780 or higher probably won't fit to and
won't fit in there the one will
definitely fit and I think ultimately I
can recommend this case for any single
graphics card configuration setup let's
have a look now also what you get with
the case Zalman also include this
bracket here which unfortunately I can't
fit due to this crappy it's sad because
this case is really good but this Zalman
cooler is really crap so I'm going to be
reviewing the sound and cooler for you
guys soon but this it comes included
with this which doesn't fit
unfortunately but this is actually
really good design because it will
support either two graphics cards if you
decide to flip it this way it will
support either two graphics cards if you
decide to flip it this way or you can
flip it this way and have it fit a CPU
cooler and a say GTX 780 so and you can
I mean it is just really good I really
like the Zelman have paid attention to
detail with everything on this case as
you can see here deep in the case you've
got cable management cut out options and
ultimately I mean there's nothing super
fancy it's kind of I see this case as
being in Jack rather than an ace and
anything but ultimately it does the job
really well with everything I mean it's
a solid case and I just keep reminding
myself in this case only costs $40 now
if we look here in the case we can see
that these fans people were complaining
about the fans and honestly I found the
fans to be absolutely fine especially
for a case that includes four and for
$40.00 people were complaining that the
fans were not strong enough I found them
to be ample fine for a person who wants
to mildly overclock their cpu say the
4.2 gigs or 4.4 on an AMD and mildly
overclock that grabbers card say to you
know 10% overclock on their graphics
card this thing will do the job as well
we've also got the bottom cutouts of
here for the power splay honestly after
using bottom cutout palce place I really
like the power supply when it's at the
bottom we've also got a dust filter
underneath which you can take out and
clean with relative ease and Zalman also
have put really solid rubber feet on
this case as well so the whole build
quality of the case again impressed me
I'd give it for $40.00 I'd give this
case a 10 out of 10 for build quality
now if you're hearing any noise as well
it's probably because of this epns fan
it's actually again when I do the review
of this cooler I'll show you tell you
how crap this thing is but anyway let's
move on now to the front of the case
okay so the front of the case includes
pretty much mesh and it's nice black and
white theme and it's got the Zalman logo
badged on there as well now these metal
brackets here there's two of them for
two 5.25 inch drive bays they've come
out with relatively relative ease and
you can also put them back in if you
want to so that's actually a really good
feature I like that they've done that
they've also got a cushion there and
ultimately yeah I mean everything I love
this case so far let's pull this let's
pull the front of this case off for you
guys so that that comes off with
relative ease and I really like the
tension of it it's not too weak but at
the same time it's not too strong as
well so I really like that Zelman have
paid attention to the build quality at
the front of the case as well it feels
pretty well built I mean everything on
this case feels really well built the
fan as you can see here it's a nice
clean cut out here if you want to take
this fan off and replace it you can
replace this with really easy to replace
you've also the drive bay installations
were a breeze I could fit this drive bay
in and out with no problems at all and
putting it back on is I mean it's not
too much of an effort just bang it on
and it goes back on like that so it's
really good the design of the front of
the case is really good so now moving on
to the front of the top of the case
sorry we've got the Zalman logo here
we've got the fan switch button which I
found was useless the reset and the
power buttons and you've got a mic in
and an audio headphone out there you've
also got 2 USB 2 slots and you also have
a USB 3 slot there now we also get to
120 millimeter fans which blow at the
top of the case and I really like these
fans and they really look subtle you
won't notice they're there and I did
mention that the build quality was
pretty good at the start like even
things like this I don't see waiting so
again they've paid attention to the
build quality in this case it really
looks good I really like it now let's
move on down to the rear of the case so
moving up to the reference case we've
got mesh here we've got two cutouts here
we've also got mesh here which I found
useful for cable management since my
power supply is from 2002 also we've got
here the this this really does this
impress me as well the power supply
mounting options there was like six
mounting points as well so if you've got
different sort of mounting positions on
your power supply to be able to mount
this power supply with relative ease
we've also got the screws there I mean
there's just lots of features on this
thing the cutouts here I did mention
that is a negative they don't go back in
once you cut them out so be mindful of
that and yeah everything on the green
looks pretty good
let's move on now to the back side of
the case there's nothing too fancy here
there's actually a nice bump out here
which sort of adds to the style of the
case and I also found it really good in
this situation where I had a lot of
extra cables because my power supply was
not modular I was able to sort of tough
a few cables in here and it sort of
solved my
of having too little space so that's
something that's on the back side of the
case let's now move on now to the
conclusions of this case because I'm
going to be putting my recommendations
on this case which this case does get a
high recommendation okay so let's move
on now to the conclusion of this case
basically this I'm sorry also I forgot
to mention it comes loaded with screws
more than you're ever going to need if
you're just doing the average install of
a single GPU gaming rig so lots of
screws included also I forgot to mention
as well that at the front here you can
also put in an extra hundred 20mm
millimeter fan if you wish to cool your
hard drives so they've paid attention to
detail and in conclusion I can recommend
this case to anyone on a budget who's
not going to be going crazy with the
overclock so it's not going to be
installing water cooling and honestly if
you've got enough money for water
cooling then come on you should go by
and really you know not in really
expensive case but you should be buying
something at least for $100 if you go
water cooling that's just my opinion
especially if it's custom water loop but
you know even if you went with a small
water cooler you could replace this fan
here and mount a single radio like a h2o
920 or a 620 you can definitely mount it
at the rear here and have it cooling
your CPU so it does have some little
options I just don't see myself mounting
a H 100 anywhere in this case or
anything custom but for $40.00 this case
is great for someone who just wants that
nice looking case that does everything
pretty well so I would call this case
the jack-of-all-trades I usually don't
use that title and I I mean that this
case just hits that title perfectly well
it's not the best case I've seen for
anything but it's not the worst case
I've seen for anything as well I mean
the drives installed relatively easy the
build quality is really damn good the
you know everything is just smooth the
front comes off and uneasy the fans
weren't relatively well
so in this case honestly gets a big
recommendation and the perfect person
for this case
someone who say using a gtx760 or an
online 270x using say a for 670 K or an
i3 or a 8320 or an FX 6300 and you're
not going crazy like this CPU cool here
this thing is really too big I'd say
like an animosity for T or a cool
monster to 12 then this case will be
perfect for you
I would recommend this case with SLI if
you were going with say two GTX 760 s
but that's one thing I would like Salman
maybe the seen them do would be maybe to
put two cutouts here
I'm not cutouts but two options or
cutouts here to install 220 millimeter
fans covering the graphics cards if they
did that then this case would be really
perfect for SLI as well in my opinion so
ultimately they've done a great job with
this case for the single GPU even a GTX
780 I recommend but again I'll stress
don't be put into GTX 780 s in this
thing I don't think it'll fit or 209 290
X's but you know definitely two
mid-range cards will fit in this fine
and I ultimately think that this whole
rig this whole case is designed for that
gamer who's going to be putting an SSD
in one hard drive 1 DVD Drive and it's
going to have that long graphics card
and also one thing to mention is well
you may wish to get a modular power
supply if you go with this case because
it is really small it's actually not
really small but ultimately I'll say I
love the size of this case it's not I
mean you could actually take this on an
airplane with you if you're traveling
and I don't think you'd get pulled up so
it's actually a bit smaller than what
I'm used to with cases and actually like
it is sort of like almost as small as a
micro ATX case so it only weighed about
6 kilograms I think and so it was
relatively light as well so highly
recommended from Salomon if you guys
have anything that I've missed about
this rig then please let me know in the
comments below also if you have anything
that
a mist or if you liked this video please
give it a thumbs up okay so before I go
I will showcase this rig for you guys as
well I said I would do it and now
basically it's got the CP NS 14 X cool
which I don't recommend
but that's calling this CPU ample fine
at four point four gigs at about one
point four two volt and now if we go to
GTX 670 in here gigabyte overclocked
condition really good graphics card I
love this graphics card especially I
love the wind force coolers I think
they're really good we've got a ocz
power supply from 2002 this 600 watt
power supply powers everything ample
fine and this is why guys this is why I
recommend OCC power supplies will I use
to especially but they've gone bankrupt
now but I used to recommend them because
they supplied really damn good pass
players
hard drive Western Digital black 640 40
gigabyte DVD drives a standard DVD drive
and yeah that's about it I may never
think he is running ample fine so I hope
you liked the build the cable
management's not the best and that's
mainly due to the cables here not being
long enough that CPU cable and PCI
Express not being long enough to route
through and do proper cable management
but out the way I did think I did a
pretty decent job considering the
limited limitations of this pass play so
I hope you enjoyed this review and this
quick look at the AMD rig if you have
any questions please let me know in the
comments and I'm gonna yes so one more
time please give a thumbs up also did
you like the new video format dude would
you like to see me maybe get better
audio on the camera and give you reviews
like this or do you like reviews where
I'm just sitting in my in my my lat
laboratory so let me know I'd love to
hear your feedback and also there is the
overclocking tutorial coming for you
guys very soon the folks on AMD and I'm
gonna be doing another not recommended
review and that's gonna be on this CPU
cooler however the difference between
this CPU cooler and the creative C was
that sometimes in some circumstances I
did recommend the creative Z for
instance if you wanted to get a
headphone amp and I thought the creative
Z was recommended by I just didn't
recommend it for some
just want one solution this however I
don't recommend and any circumstances I
think the Animax t40 man I should have
paid that extra three dollars because I
was regretting it so this thing you can
even hear it's probably not you can hear
the noise the noise that you hear is
coming from this CPU fan everything else
here is really quiet this CPU cooler is
making the noise and that's pissing me
off
anyways hope you enjoyed this review and
I'll catch you guys later peace out for
now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
