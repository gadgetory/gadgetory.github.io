some tech yes loving I'm not used
products well in that case guys let's go
find some used products and I am joined
by the MSI rep for Australia she's in
charge of the laptop division so do you
want to introduce yourself to the
audience I take your city viewers my
name is EULA and place by MSI laptop
Thank You dari guys don't worry about
buying an MSI laptop because today she's
gonna come on a used PC Potts hunt with
us and while you're at it can we get
some tech yes city merch on there please
guys let us know in the comments does
this look better or the MSI shirt
welcome back guys to February's used PC
parts on of the month and I am joined by
the msi rep this month she came up to
talk about collaborating this year on
msi laptops however i thought while
we're at it we should just give her the
authentic tech yes experience and that
is just take her on a used PC parts hunt
with us this month so what do you say
anyway guys to make sure we get deals
and to show what it's all about we're
gonna go see our trusty friend les who
has just awesome deals all the time
waiting for us so we're gonna head over
there right now jump in the yes 'mobile
let's get going
do you know what this is okay so this is
the part of the deals that we got so far
from lairs
he had a few pcs on him that I was
interested in but I sort of wanted the
bargains at the moment and so he ended
up getting two lenovo pcs from him this
one here he ended up doing it for $70
because the power supply is faulty the
case is damaged but it's got a Thai 520
440 bytes of RAM and also of course the
motherboard and the cooler installed and
of course Windows prints stalled on
these machines so for 70 ozzie dollars
which would be like 50 USD that's an
absolute bargain for the first deal then
the next deal he managed to give this to
us for a hundred and sixty Aussie
dollars this is a complete system here
with the i5 4460 eight gigabytes around
one terabyte hard drive and of course
you get the cooler in the motherboard
included so there the first two deals we
got and also I picked up two HD monitors
1080p 23 inch monitors for $50 a pop so
he did a really good deal for us and
maybe that was because EULA was there
she's she's got that magic
so new guys we've lined up a few deals
here one which I've already been
messaging behind the scenes it's called
an antique skeleton case or something
and it's such a unique case I honestly I
remember these came out a long time ago
but it's crazy how one that's still out
there in the wild is still like pretty
much brand new in box so I offered 80
ozzie dollars for this and they accepted
and they said I can pick it up tomorrow
so that's one deal we've already lined
this up
you were actually lined this deal up but
also guys we've got two potential deals
up here now
one is a gtx 660 it's like a faulty
graphics card they say one day they
turned it on one day it just stopped
working so I'm gonna call him up and I
mean I wouldn't mind picking it up for
10 bucks it just seems like you maybe
could be able to fix it with some tech s
lovin and then another deal is a x58
system they're asking two hundred and
twenty-five dollars I think for it I'm
gonna come in with an offer of 150 and
if we can land those two deals and
that'd be pretty good but other than
that there's not a whole lot out there
I wouldn't mind maybe doing a thorough
check tomorrow as it is starting to get
a little bit late but let's give these
two deals a call and see if we can score
them or at least sauce them out so Rick
didn't pick up his phone we're gonna
send him a text message with the offer
see if he gets back to us let's try the
next deal okay so we're out of lock two
for two this is kind of sad because I
wanted you were to see real time at
teach her the ways of the bogan you know
guys we'll keep you updated with the
booze pots and what comes out of it
tomorrow cuz you'll is only here for two
days and so yesterday I just showed her
around the Gold Coast a little bit and -
not gonna take her out for dinner and
show her a good Gold Coast restaurant
and we're also gonna meet up with rocket
jumping injure - and introduce rocket
jump ninja -
the laptop division not that not the
right I don't think you'd have really
any need for a laptop but let's go have
some fun anyway do you want to say
anything she doesn't talk she's just
liking the shirt so much
so let's now the next day and the night
just ended up going away just spent it
with friends had a good time and the GTX
660 guy got back to me and said that the
card had just dropped out when he
restarted the computer one time so I
believe that may be a good pickup like I
could potentially salvage that and a 10
Ozzie dollars it's like yeah why not I
mean I'm sort of curious about I don't
know what it is he also had an online
280x for sale he told me and he wanted
$50 for it but it has that problem where
the as soon as you install the driver
the card clunks out now in my personal
experience I've never fixed an AMD card
that's had this problem so I just told
him nah man you keep that one in terms
of the x58 system the guy wanted about
two hundred and ten dollars I think so I
got to think about that one I think it's
a little bit too much we're still gonna
add in the Xeon change the graphics card
around possibly clean some things up and
of course still don't know if there's
any problems involved with that but from
here on I'm gonna take you to the
airport but on the way a rocket jump
ninja lives right near the airport so I
guess anyone who comes through the Gold
Coast will stop off at rocketjump ninjas
place and get a mouse recommendation so
let's go do that
so what Mouse did you end up picking
here at least one and why because I
don't know it just fit my hand I love
the size and it's also pain yeah I know
something's I love love Pink's 150 - if
you pick you had two choices
uh-huh so what is this one D yes missus
lee seung-jae CBC s1 yeah this is he
easy Oh easy too easy to be yeah you see
to be in shape towards a right hand
it is almost fee for the reckon good
okay yeah she ended up getting the pink
one fellas she's just another victim for
marketing
so you'll have now just departed the
Gold Coast and I'm a size house and he
actually lives a little bit away from me
so I'm gonna go on gumtree now and face
book marketplace and see if I can find
some deals whilst I'm at the rocketjump
ninja studio
so now the first deal of the second day
that we've pulled up here is actually
really good if I can land this it's 64
gigabytes of ddr4 memory now they are
quite far from me but since it's RAM
it'll probably be easy to post so
they're asking 350 but they do say in
the ad if you buy all of it 300 Ozzie
dollars which is like two hundred and
ten US dollars for 64 gigabytes of ddr4
this is a bargain I'm going to call them
up and just see if they'll chuck in free
postage and I'll pay that amount so they
didn't pick up the phone I did just send
them a text message so hopefully they
get back to us let's look at the next
deal right here so next thing we've got
up here is again another 64 gigabytes of
ddr3 this time however 2133 megahertz of
memory so this is actually really good
stuff and they're asking in total 200
Ozzie dollars which would make it very
cheap if we could get this whole kit
especially since it does look like it's
really good overclockable stuff so I'm
gonna give them a call and again since
they do live very far from me I'm gonna
see if they just can include postage for
the asking price so we actually even
have a phone number there so I just
dropped him a message as well okay no
worries yeah if it's if it's a if it's
decent I'll pick it up for sure yeah not
a problem
yes let us know what time you yeah
you're on your way home and then just
thanks to my bike so we're all good to
pick up that case it's like ten years
old now and we're getting that for $8
but they also said they got a power
supply there for 20 bucks so if that's
available I'll pick that up too always
getting good bargains you never turn it
down and we also got a reply on this
exfoliates of ddr3 memory already that
looks to be a good okay Paul go ahead
with that so that's a pretty good deal
on sort of memory of that Kalibak so
I'll update you guys once I pick up the
case and also if the other people get
back to us especially that ddr4 memory
deal
so we just go back to the tech yes
studio and right here on the desk
is such a unique case I haven't seen
these things for so long I've never
built in one but I was always curious
back in the day I picked it out for a
tea Ozzie dolls and it's literally like
brand-new so the guy said he didn't even
use it he wanted to use it for a build
but it's just been sitting in his garage
for so so long we could even see down
here 2008 so this thing's over eleven
years old and it still looks pretty cool
like it's got a different look to it
hence why I really wanted to do a
different build I think I'll do Metro
Exodus in this case right here but let
us know guys what do you think of this
case down in the comment section below
like I am a just stupid for buying it or
do you think it's actually a pretty cool
pickup I sort of I paid $80 for it 80
ozzie dollars but I think since it's
like brand-new I actually think it's a
really good pickup even for the money
but other than that guys we've got some
deals lined up we ended up picking up
the 64 gigabytes of ddr3 memory I've
paid the guy he's going to ship it to me
and also the 64 years of ddr4 memory
they've messaged me and apparently
someone is already booked it to pick it
up tomorrow morning but she said if they
don't come through then it's mine so I
was like awesome hopefully the person
doesn't pick it up because 64 gigabytes
of RAM for the price like ddr4 for that
price is an exceptionally good deal even
if one of the sticks was bad I think I'd
still be getting a real good pick up
there so fingers crossed for that one
because they agreed to even post it if
the other set person doesn't pick up the
deal so super excited about that one
hopefully it comes through and I'll
actually update the video right now with
a quick edit because I'll be editing
this video tomorrow and let you guys
know in this video right now if I got
the deal
also the GTF 660 we ended up putting a
deposit down for $10 so pick that up
when I'm in that area so that's on the
way to and I'll put that in the pile
here for the next episode of can yes fix
it so the pile is sort of stacking up
there stay tuned for that one and we
ended up getting these two monitors off
layers and these two computers and I
mean lez always just hooks up really
good deals he's always a reliable source
and since I had a friend over for this
month part hunt I'd like sort of wanted
to make sure we didn't fail straight
away
hence why I went to less thank you so
