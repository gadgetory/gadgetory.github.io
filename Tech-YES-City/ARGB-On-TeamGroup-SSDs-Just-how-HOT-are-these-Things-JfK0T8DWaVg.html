Booth for Computex 2019
and they have a heap of
new products on display.
First off all being ARGB SSDs
and also ARGB DDR4 memory.
Now, I have put these to the test already.
So, I managed to get out my thermal camera
here on the showroom floor
and the temperatures are absolutely fine.
It looks like they're
using eight of these LEDs
in both the memory and the SSDs.
And for the SSDs, it was
the T-Force Delta Max.
These are gonna come in at 250 gigabytes
to two terabyte form factors.
They are across SATA three drives.
And they do, as we said just before,
have a cut-down amount of LEDs
of eight versus 20 on
the previous versions.
The thermal camera is showing
that four is on the top.
Four is on the bottom.
And when I first saw this,
I legitimately thought
it was an LCD screen and
I had to ask 'em if it was
and they said, &quot;No,
it's not an LCD screen.&quot;
So, they have got that look on point.
But in terms of release dates and pricing,
they still have to update the pricing.
But a release date looks like
it will be early quarter three.
So, stay tuned for that if
you wanna turn the bling
up a notch inside your PC.
But what else have they
got on display here?
Let's take a look and, of
course, do the temperature tests.
(techno music)
We have the XTREEM, minus
the E, but go on with the X.
This has got a mirror
finish just like that SSD
we saw before, the Delta Max.
The speeds are comin' in
at up to 4.8 gigahertz XMPs
with 1.5 volt.
These are slated for a
quarter three release as well,
but the pricing is still unavailable.
In terms of the temperatures,
I checked them out both
inside the build and outside
the build, the display models,
and they are checking out absolutely fine,
so you got nothing to worry
about as I believe JayzTwoCents
did do a video where he had
an RGB LED SSD overheating.
But, these SSDs and RAM here
have nothing to worry about
since the ARGB technology,
it is a smaller, condensed,
brighter LED, so it's
gonna put out less power
as well as giving more bling.
But on top of that, plus their
previous generation SSDs,
you got nothing to worry about
since the previous generation
didn't overheat at all.
However, what about
those non RGB products?
They have released a new SKU of RAM
that has no heat syncs on side.
These will feature SK hynix 2400 megahertz
as well as 2600 megahertz, black PCB,
but still a little bit stylish.
So, if you wanna put this
inside a home theater PC,
for example, then you
can definitely do that,
and still keep things blinged up a notch.
But, speaking of SSD SATA
three, if you don't like RBG,
they are releasing the Vulcan variance
both in the black and silver aesthetic.
These have metal casings.
They do have that quality feel.
But it's for someone who
doesn't like the RGB bling.
That isn't for everyone, so
they are releasing a few models
of that besides their memory.
But on top of that, you've
got the Z340 and Z440
MVNE SSDs coming out.
Now, with the recent rise and announcement
of PCA Gen 4 X570, you've
not got the ability
to go over three gigabytes
per second across
that three by four being PCA four by four.
And so, with that, you're
gonna expect this drive,
up to read speeds of 3800 megahertz.
Write speed's a little bit less.
In terms of pricing and
release date, pricing,
they will update that.
In terms of the release date,
we're looking at another
quarter three release
for these two drives.
Now, onto the last of the
products on display at Team Group,
they've got the T-Force
Treasure External SSD.
So, if you like external SSDs
and you have to have your RGB bling,
then they managed to put
a strip on the side there
that glows through and
you plug it into your PC,
it lets you know that that drive is on.
Plug it off, let's you know that it's off.
Great for diagnosing faulty USB ports
if they don't put out any power
but other than that, giving a bit of bling
and maybe annoying some people.
Now, continuing on with the RGB,
we've got the little external USB drive
called the T-Force Spark.
And this is, again, got
a little bit of RGB bling
on an external USB drive.
So, if you're into RBG, then
Team Group have you covered
with their new T-Force lineup of products.
In terms of a release date,
it's like triple or quadrupling
down on that quarter three,
just like all the other products
that haven't been released yet.
Anyway guys, that's it
from the booth to here
for Computex 2019 for Team Group.
If you enjoyed this
one, then be sure to hit
that like button for us.
Also, let us know in the
comments section below
what do you think of
these RGB SSDs on display?
Also the new ARGB, are you diggin' it?
Is it not your forte?
Love reading your thoughts
and opinions as always.
And with that aside, I'm gonna
move on to the next booth
and I hope to catch you guys
in another tech video very soon.
If you wanna see the moment
they drop, sub button,
ring the bell, and also if
you want that inside scoop,
TechYESCity on Instagram.
And I'll catch you on the next one.
Peace out for now.
Bye.
