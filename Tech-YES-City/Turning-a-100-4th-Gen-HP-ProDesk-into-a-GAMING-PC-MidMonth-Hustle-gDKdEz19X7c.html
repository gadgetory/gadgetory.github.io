been so many new products being released
and of course with that a lot of these
places are like tech yes can you check
out our product but on that case it does
frustrate me this month a little bit
because there's just so many products
coming out to the point where I just
need to go out and have a bit of tech
yes therapy and that's a bit of hustling
on the road so while I'm in the car I'm
gonna be searching for some deals
because I got to go up to Brisbane to do
something and also on that note I'll be
seeing Liz who is also up in Brisbane he
usually does me regular deals here from
month to month especially if you guys
saw the last parts hunt we visited les
picked up a few goods and he always
hooks up for a pretty good price but
there's also one more thing I'm going to
be doing and that is going to a retailer
and taking back some faulty products and
seeing if they can change them over
because I've got to faulty hard drives
and a faulty power supply too and of
course if they're still under warranty
then I want to get the brand new pot so
I'm gonna see how all that goes down but
with that aside let's get the wheels
turning and the hustling started if
you're in the market for a ninth gen
Intel CPU Nvidia sponsor Ezra has you
covered with the extreme 4 you've got a
12 phase BRM for the CPU power delivery
purity sound 4 and polychrome RGB
software control from the BIOS to ensure
that you get the smoothest FPS possible
whilst you're gaming
links in description below for more
information
so on the way up to Brisbane we found a
deal here for GT X 1080 they wanted 450
ozzie dollars I put in an offer for
hundred and they said yes so that's
about two hundred and eighty US dollars
and for a GTX 1080 that's a pretty good
price I'm actually very happy with that
because you can put this in a sort of a
higher-end build now and then I get some
good money for that so depends on what
you couple it with I'm thinking since I
did get that zeal on the 1270 v2 in last
month's part hunt that would make a
perfect combination with this GPU for
some 1440p gaming so with that aside
let's go now to the next place that's
lasers and pickups or see what he's got
see if he's got some deals for us
so we just finished up at lenses place
and the boot has three monitors well
actually four monitors because I had to
take a faulty motherboard back to him
and then replace that for a monitor so
that was like the trade I did and we
also had a HP system there and I haven't
tried a HP system in a while and I know
the second and third gens are kind of
shaky but this one's got a half decent
power supply included with it so my
thinking there is if I can extract the
power supply motherboard CPU RAM and all
that goodness then I can actually try to
get it working with a lower powered
graphics card and then I'd have a whole
system done for really cheap so that's
looking like it'll be good if I can get
it home and get it all working so we'll
do that later in the video but from here
on in we're going to go to a place
called computer Alliance where I've
bought some PC parts from some of those
are faulty and we're gonna see if I can
get those changed over for some brand
new parts
so just got finished up here in computer
Alliance and the service was actually
really good so I took the two hard
drives in and the power supply and I
didn't even need a receipt they scanned
everything in because they've all got
their barcodes now and that
automatically registers in their machine
it tells you what order that was
attached to and so they changed
everything over on the spot so now I've
got two new hard drives and a new power
supply too and with that aside it's time
to get back to the tech er studio and
check out this HP see if we can get that
working
so now we're back at the studio and here
is the quick one-day mini hustle of
course they don't count they're the
warranty replacements but three monitors
and also GT X 1080 and a HP now our less
did Chuck in a 19 inch monitor for free
but he said it might be faulty and I can
check it out but I just I put it up in
the garage because Hunt don't have time
at the moment to check out a faulty
monitor but this is the challenge right
here and I think it could go well
basically there's two problems I'm
seeing so far looking at this that is
the front panel power switch and also
this cooler here if it's actually
mounted through the holes to the case so
we'd have to use a different cooler but
if we can get this to boot up off a say
for instance my little golden tool that
I use by shorting out the two pins and
we can put a graphics card in here then
it would be okay for a transplant I
believe so
we're gonna try that first let's see if
we've got a signal
so we've now managed to boot this PC up
off a single short so that's a good
thing and that we can use a power switch
off a normal case for this build but I'm
trying to get into the BIOS to see if I
can get some of those options out
extract some of those options like
secure boot and UEFI PCIe boot and the
thing is I can't even get in it like
says escape for startup menu and I'm
like I'm hitting escape of try to heat
the different keyboards here I just
can't get in so I'm guessing it might
need a piss to Keeble but this is the
weirdest thing you press f1 and it'll
it'll work so I mean it's just classical
HP crap but without a side I mean we're
just gonna chuck it in a case and hope
and pray that it does work and I got a
feeling it does so it is 4th gen so and
what I'm doing with it is I'm taking all
the proprietary out and we're gonna use
all that proprietary so we're coming
into a little bit of problem this was
indeed screwed down to the case and
taking it out didn't really yield us any
good results and I tried doing some kind
of ghetto rigging there and it didn't
work but you can see here that the
mounting system is proprietary it's not
gonna fit anything conventional so what
I need to do is I need to get some nuts
for the bottom of this and try and
secure this cooler onto the CPU so I
gotta see what I've got around the
studio might even have it if I don't
have it then I'm gonna wait till the
hardware store if it's tomorrow in order
to finish this
so now got this concept and it is
booting which is incredible so this is
really good news at least for me cos
we've got an 80 plus gold rated power
supply down there
it supports 240 watts max and so we're
gonna be stress testing this after we
install Windows and if this does pass
the stress tests then I'm gonna show you
guys all the little janky things that I
did here to get this to work because
we're using a fan splitter up the top
there then we cut out a piece right
there for the CPU fan because it had a
weird proprietary connector and of
course we're using a solder connector
for the RX 470 soldered to PCIe 6 pin so
this is like crazy because the amount of
money we paid of course is very little
compared to what you'd pay for I guess
oh Am's like vos churros and stuff that
are ready to work so hopefully this all
installs and then we'll come back and
we'll run the benchmark for a good while
and see the results
so we've now been running this for a few
different benchmarks here on heaven it's
passing absolutely fine and now the
funny thing is I did a video recently
comparing the 470 versus the 570 on the
rx series and with the 9900 K these
scores are pretty much exactly the same
so in other words this 46 70s CPU couple
with this rx 470 is not presenting any
bottlenecks whatsoever so that's a
really good sign of course we've got the
240 white-gold rated power supply and
we've got all this proprietary stuff but
let's move over now to the desk where
I'm gonna talk a lot more about that
because there is some drawbacks to it
and I mean you do have to have a bit of
patience to get this to work but
regardless it is working breathe it in
fellow tech yes citizens breathe it in
that right there is the smell of victory
and what we had with this HP OEM fitted
into this case was something that
honestly with an SSD a gig of ram fiber
to you bike backup hard drive
46 70s and if RX 470 we've put this
together for 270 Aussie dollars in total
so that would be about 190 USD and we've
got bling to go with it now some scary
things with this and some things to be
careful of I couldn't actually get out a
power rating with this power supply so
this is that proprietary that the power
Mayda that I had here red a constant 7.3
Watts so I'm guessing there's something
blocking it out on the input end which
is scary because I've never seen that
before and that's able to not give us a
reading at all if I had to guesstimate
the power consumption of this build I'd
put it around maybe 180 watts with the
RX 470 so everything is going to be
completely under control we're still
coming under that 240 watt limit with
some room to breathe and the good thing
about this board is it's got a lot of
USB ports at the back everything just
works really smoothly though we do have
a USB 3 connection on it that we can't
get access to because the RX 470 is
covering that slot so if you do want to
put in
smaller graphics card say for instance
gtx 1650 then that would work and you'd
be able to get your USB street-front out
and so the funny thing is about this
build is that they've used proprietary
connections on the power supply where
you do need that power supply because
it's got those different connectors that
run off the motherboard but they've also
got this little white pin connector on
the side that runs from the power supply
I'm guessing that's the initiation and
so what HP decided to do was do all that
proprietary stuff there but then leave
things like the onboard audio connectors
the USB ports and even the power supply
connector not proprietary and so in the
case of dell i've tried some stuff with
those Dells in the past and they've got
like a power switch that has three pins
and it's very hard to get around that in
order to boot those Dell motherboards
probably this however doesn't have
proprietary after the PAL spline
motherboard so it is possible and you
can do it with ease and now the good
thing about this fourth gen build here
is that it does have those options to
disable secure boot enable PCIe boot
from UEFI on the fourth gen I know in
previous generations especially second
and third gen can have a lot of
headaches trying to get a something like
an rx 470 for example to boot off that
motherboard and in this case it doesn't
have those options because it was fourth
gen it was newer they probably said okay
let's enable these motherboards to boot
with modern graphics cards and I guess
they just didn't suspect that six years
down the track or whatever they'd be
this Boggan from Australia who'd be
piecing together these pcs with
modern-day graphics cards and then
putting together gaming pcs and that's
the funny thing I guess none of these
guys back in those days
intended for CPUs to sort of stagnate as
much as they have
but GPUs to keep going and so this
Hardware here now is still gold in 2019
especially at the prices you can get the
whole kit for and included with the
power supply I mean that's just
fantastic value for money and you've
even got a Windows 10 Pro license
activated on these boards so the value
for money is just screaming out to me at
this bill right now and I'm just so
happy with it though again the drawbacks
we've
got a limited amount of connections from
this past play I've used the two-sided
connections for the hard drive in the
SSD then I've used a sada two PCIe six
pin for the RX 470 and I've also used a
fan extension 2 for fan pin headers to
power all the fans in this case and
surprisingly that works absolutely fine
and that's running yeah again for fans
off of one header which I've done in the
past on different motherboards and you
know it doesn't work when the LEDs are
starting to cut out and stuff like that
these fans are running absolutely fine
so whatever components they're put in
the power supply in the motherboard
they've done it right they've actually
built this motherboard and power supply
up really strong and I guess that's for
the business world of things but you can
then use that for gaming PC's and it's
going to be reliable but the other
hurdle we also had was that CPU cooler
it is proprietary - so you're going to
have to use that cooler with the 46 70s
so the way you get around that is even
just getting some nuts
and going nuts and screwin those things
off in the case that we've got here and
then the last thing was that CPU for pin
fan connector where it did have a
different bottom end so you just have to
cut out that little bracket in the CPU
fan and then plug it into the
motherboard that way and it surprisingly
works so they didn't change around the
configuration of those pin layouts for
that other fan connector on the board
but the funny thing is when you do do
this your CPU fan is now pushing air the
other way but I don't imagine it'd be a
problem since we are using an Rx 470
reference which does suck air in and
then blows it out the back of the case
so everything is looking amazing this is
I guess a new meta for you guys if you
want to put a gaming PC together for
your friends family or whatever and you
just want really good value for money in
one of these pcs pops up for sale then
it's worth a look
I mean keep in mind you will need some
extensions so I'll put some links in the
description below you need a solder two
PCIe converter if you want to use a
graphics card that's low power don't go
too crazy they don't go putting in rx
580 in this thing because I just don't
think it'll work but an Rx 470 uses a
lot less power I think it was about 89
90 watts from when I did my test and a
pretty
video if you haven't seen nobody I'll
put the link up here but with all that
out of the way this is a mid month
hustle that just ended up being
something completely different to what I
intended it to be initially but that's
this the way things go I really enjoy
doing this kind of stuff I know some
people are in the comments and this
comes up all the time here on the
channel they love the youth stuff they
love the hustle and again that's not
going anywhere I love doing this stuff
for you guys I love sharing all the
secrets I don't really care about oh you
know you keep your magicians you keep
his secrets and not show anyone but it
doesn't matter because I'm here and I
guess I just got into YouTube to sort of
show these things to people and then in
turn a lot of people behind the scenes
have shown me things that I've then
shared on the channel too so I learned
new things from you guys and then I do
things like this and help people out and
show them new metas but there's also the
new products as we said in the intro
they come in full force this month and I
do and I've said this in the past the
reason I do the new parts is because it
helps me to do the used parts obviously
new parts is going to be a lot more
money in terms of you do a review for
something if it's a good product then
you've got affiliate links and it's just
more profitable than doing used parts
but of course because my passion I love
doing all the you stuff I then use the
new stuff to fuel the use passion and so
that's something I've always been
transparent about here on the channel
but also the biggest benefit of doing
that is that I can then compare the new
stuff versus the use stuff which I know
a lot of you guys love because the views
and the likes on those videos usually go
out of control so stay tuned for that
x58 comparison it's coming early next
month anyway guys with that aside I hope
you enjoyed today's video if you did
then be sure to give us a big like and
also let us know in the comment section
below what you think about what we did
here today with this HP machine and also
what you think of that GT X 1080 deal we
got I thought that was pretty good for
400 Ozzie dollars with 280 u.s. that's
definitely going to go into like a
higher end gaming PC and you can
definitely make a bit of profit doing
stuff like that and without a slide I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
