card so just this moment the postman
rocked up with a very special package
this is AMD's Radeon 7 and it looks
really good right next to Darth judge
are here sporting the red and black but
one thing I want to know with this
upcoming review is what games do you
guys want to see tested let us know in
the comments below I don't have much
time I'm going to be comparing this
against the r-tx 2080 but here today
we're gonna take some really nice shots
of this card talk about what it features
in terms of just the card itself without
showing you any numbers but also talk
about some things going in with AMD
versus Nvidia but anyway let's open this
thing up and take some cool shots for
you guys
so here's the graphics card right here
it looks like it is going to weigh in at
one point three kilos roughly so does
have a very thick and very heavy cooler
also it looks like it's got a really
nice backplate but this is this thing
here is it also came along with it the
AMD Radeon seven know I have quickly
watched other unboxings out there and
looks like it does come with batteries
but these ones were already
pre-installed so I'm guessing this this
looked like it was a sample that got
passed around and in Australia it's
pretty common actually to juggle samples
between different tech review sites and
media because we do get limited samples
down under whether it be graphics cards
CPUs or any other part but here it is
right here it looks like it's got a cool
LED light on the side so yeah let's see
this thing in all its glory and what
kind of shots we can take for you guys
but this is sitting on an AOC monitor
and that's just because I just picked
this up as well on a deal 150 Aussie
dollars for a 4k 28-inch VA panel I
believe so that's a really good deal
we'll talk about that in the deal song
but let's put this thing on here get
those shots for you guys
you
so here's the card here it measures in
just under 27 centimeters and here's
this little display here with its LED
light it actually is RGB but it's pretty
underpowered so I hope the graphics card
doesn't perform like this LED because
we're gonna be test against the r-tx
2080 now some new things I think with
this is that they have updated the VCE
that's the video coding engine as
opposed to the CPU which uses like h.264
or an invidious case they use the NVE NC
I believe for their encoding on their
GPUs and so this one here I do want to
test it out in Adobe Premiere Pro
because one thing I am pretty curious
about is the support in an application
like Adobe where we do know Intel is
working hand-in-hand with Adobe - pretty
much optimized not just their CPUs for
that application but also their onboard
HD graphics where you look at the
recommended specs and graphics cards for
that you can't see many especially
gaming graphics cards on NVIDIA send and
then on AMD Zend I don't even see one
gaming graphics card supported on the
official recommendation list but you
look at Intel CPUs even the HD graphics
it's like all the 5000 series all the
6000 series and then when we look at a
program like Sony Vegas when we utilize
graphics cards like these in there
OpenCL support as well as in video with
their cuda support they perform much
faster than quick sync in something like
Vegas for example as opposed to quick
sync and Intel CPUs currently being top
dog in Adobe Premiere Pro so they did
state that they have improved
performance on 25% in programs like
Adobe Premiere Pro so that would be
great to see if this thing does work as
sort of like a budget option for people
who can't afford the fire pros or the
Quadros but they want something that's
just absolutely beast for productivity
and gaming since it does have 16
gigabytes of HP m2 onboard but another
thing is they have reduced the
transistors from 14 nanometer to 7
nanometer on this particular graphics
card and this means that they're able to
get higher clock speeds however
ironically enough Vegas 64 had 4096
stream processors I believe this one has
2,840 I don't know if that's some kind
of cruel joke referring to true 4k vs.
UHD on the resolutions but they match up
perfectly but looking on the back of
this card you've got three display ports
as well as a HDMI out I'm not sure I
believe that BH DMI to
and these should be DisplayPort 1.4 I'm
not entirely sure I will have to ask AMD
send them an email and then get back to
you guys in the review and let you know
exactly what those ports are but in
terms of power connectors here we've got
two eight pin feeds and then this logo
here is a one that lights up with that
Radeon logo and you guys how well does
this thing perform how well does it
overclock and also how loud are the fans
and all that juicy information will be
coming in the review in a couple of days
so make sure you stay tuned with the sub
box hit and those notification bells
ringing and now another thing about this
graphics card too is I know it's not
Navi I know a lot of people were
anticipating that AMD would just crush
CES with the Navi announcements and the
pricing announcements but it is a jump
down from 40 nanometers seven nanometer
so I'm definitely curious to see how
this thing performs which I'm going to
be putting it on the test bench right
now and checking out the performance for
you guys so let us know in the comments
to what you think of AMD with the Radeon
7 launch do you think the $700 price tag
is okay or do you think it's too steep
considering this will be their flagship
graphics card when it is launched and if
you're Australia these cards will be had
from 1070 AUD if you're in New Zealand I
think it's 1250 New Zealand dolls and
you get three games bundled with this
card as well the Devil May Cry Resident
Evil 2 and also the division 2 so that's
pretty cool but also will say absolutely
love the look of this graphics card I
think they've got that boxy clean look
absolutely down pat with the Radeon 7 I
mean what do you guys think of the grabs
card in the way it looks
I definitely think they're getting a
step up on their game especially
compared to previous graphics cards and
even Vega 56 in Vega 64 and there was a
rumor going around that only 5000 of
these were being made I don't think
that's the case AMD will make these to
keep up with demand if enough of them
sell and if the card is good enough keep
in mind I don't
no any performance just yet so with that
said I'm gonna get on out of here do
some testing and if you guys want to see
