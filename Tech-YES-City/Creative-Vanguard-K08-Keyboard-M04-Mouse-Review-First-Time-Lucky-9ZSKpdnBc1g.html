the mail to be honest I wasn't surprised
to see a keyboard mouse and mouse pad in
there though when I saw it was from
creative that's when I was surprised
this marks their first mouse and
keyboard to enter the already highly
competitive and saturated gaming
crippled market and one has to wonder
can their products stand out well let's
find out
so welcome back to tech city this is
Brian today we have here a keyboard with
unique attributes and upon pulling off
the caps I noticed there was some very
unique switches from on Ron that's right
the guys that make those awesome Mouse
switches also make keyboard switches and
these are called the Pres or short for
perceive react execute switch which
besides the name sounding a bit
confusing actually is really damn good
they are a unique switch but feel
similar to a Logitech romaji which kind
of feels like a mechanical Brown with a
touch of extra feedback and the spice of
real force thrown in there anyway
besides the wacky description they are
actually really nice to type on and the
noise is actually quite low I'll let you
guys take a listen for yourselves on Ron
rates the actuation force at 45 grams
with the space bar filling a little
stiffer and the keys are rated up to 70
million actuations
in other words something else like a cap
will probably die on this keyboard
before the switches do actuation
distance is also at a distance of 1.5
millimeters which in this case I've
found in a real world test it was
actuated in about one third of the way
down of a full press which is great for
competitive gaming 26 key rollover is
supported and when doing my super spam
test I noticed that it didn't choke at
all so these claims do seem legit the
board features a 2 meter braided cable
and with two gold-tipped USB headers one
for the USB pass-through which is on the
back of the keyboard and the other for
pairing the keyboard and data transfer
the k8 weighs in at about 1.2 kilograms
and has a nice matte black finish to it
and does include a wrist rest that is
easily attachable and detachable but I
think it is a little too easy to detach
and comes off pretty easy though it is a
nice size and is quite comfortable the
lighting has three different brightness
settings and there's also a volume knob
and a mute button as well as windows
lock and media keys there's also the SPX
button and that allows you to link in
with Sound Blaster studio looking
further into the software which can be
used for both the K 8 and n poor Mouse
has a lot of functionality
and is very straightforward with all the
options you would want you can control
things like individual key backlighting
and can save this to your own preset on
the keyboards hardware itself there are
some unique pre-made lighting effects
too
that look pretty cool and allow you to
control the beats per minute on top of
all that you can record macros and
assign them to unique keys or even this
side extra five macro keys which can be
additionally programming remapped so you
can use them in games like World of
Warcraft for example as your num keys or
use them in games like dota 2 as a macro
for a character like axe for example
there's also adjustable polling rates
and easy firmware upgrades so lastly I
wanted to take a look at the m4 siege
mouse which sits somewhere between
fingertip and palm grip but more towards
palm grip since it is a larger Mouse
weighing in at about a hundred and ten
grams without cable drag the sensor is
the picsArt 3360 infrared and has
support for up to 12,000 dpi and a 2
millimeter liftoff distance which
through software can be changed to 3
millimeter which I found legitimately
worked the main two buttons and all
other buttons are on run switches which
are rated to 5 million clicks the clip
could be described as a hard snappy
click which is just how I like it and
the scroll wheel is firm and you can
reliably use the center click without
having to worry too much about scrolling
up and down there is also a side button
that allows you to drastically drop your
DPI for sniping and will make the mouse
light up another color when testing the
input lag there was virtually none which
is great news for the m4 and if I had to
guesstimate it would be somewhere
between 0 to 2 milliseconds and this is
done by comparing it to what I have here
that is the Logitech G 302 which
virtually has no input lag at all so it
is verdict time in both the keyboard and
mouse impressed me especially for their
first release I think reiated nailed it
not only did they bring a unique
keyboard to the market but they also
have their software which was very
straightforward and the mouse performed
really well with a high quality sensor
and also extremely low levels of input
lag that rivaled that of Logitech's the
keyboard switches were really nice to
type on in game on and everything felt
of really high quality the K 8 keyboard
is currently retailing around 140 US and
the m4 Mouse is reeling for 60
five us as four AUD pricing and
availability it is intended to hit the
streets but no official word just yet
lastly the mousepad is also pretty nice
too and is included with the limited
edition creative weapons case that I
received which was sent out for review
and if you want to get one of these they
cost around two hundred and ninety nine
dollars so there is a bit of an extra
premium if you were to just buy these
individual items separately it's kind of
like a limited edition thing so what
about the negatives well the first and
most obvious one there is that price tag
so it is pretty expensive for both the
keyboard and mouse and the second thing
I noticed was the included wrist rest
method of attaching and detaching could
use some work but besides that
everything else checks out really nice
the backlighting is also really strong
and some of the strongest I've seen so
those who want the option for bling will
certainly get it with this keyboard you
know guys that's about it for me today
if you like this video then be sure to
hit that like button and let me know in
the comments section below do you want
to try the omron press keyboard switches
they were pretty unique and I have to
say that I do like them I am trying them
currently as my daily driver and they
are really nice to type on end game on
to great balance there although they do
feel a little bit different to both top
rate and Cherry MX switches though I'd
love to hear your thoughts and opinions
as always and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
