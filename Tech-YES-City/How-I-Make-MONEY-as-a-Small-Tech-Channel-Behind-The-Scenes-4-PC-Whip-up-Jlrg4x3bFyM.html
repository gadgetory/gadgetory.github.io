I make money as a smaller youtuber at
least compared to the bigger tech
channels and when you look at my social
blade figures you see that I don't
really make a whole lot from ads even
though that is a big chunk of my money
every month I do make money from other
things like affiliate links sometimes
they'll be pre-roll ads and of course
behind me there will be things like this
and that is the use PC parts hustle and
today I'm going to take you guys through
a behind-the-scenes whip up that I've
got here so I picked up these two builds
really cheap of a friend called Luke and
that's going to be in a new episode of
PC house-call so you'll see that hitting
the channel soon so now for this build
we've got two cases here one is a rotor
k40 one never heard of the case before
all the brand but apparently it comes
with tempered glass three RGB LED fans
and RGB LED strips now we picked that up
for around about 85 Australian dollars
which would be like 60 something USD and
beside that is the new fractal design
focus G I got this in white apparently
that comes with two fans as well so I
actually haven't opened up either of
these cases yet so I don't know what's
inside we're gonna pair that with a Vega
56 card and also a GTX 1080 now I did
pick these up for really good prices and
these are the cheapest flat pack black
cable power supplies I can get I got
these for around about $80 each these
are the Thermaltake smart power 5:51 so
old black cables make the build look
really neat so with that aside let's
start pulling these cases apart and then
transplanting them into this new shindig
so just unbox both these cases here and
this one doesn't have tempered glass
it's actually perspex so I'm very happy
still with how they look but it's time
to build these out so we're gonna move
over there where I've got a lot of room
and I'm gonna start piecing out these
builds I'll show you what's inside them
exactly and then we'll take them out and
start putting them in both these builds
so now we're taking the builds apart
they're exactly the same as each other
and you can see there's a sixty seven
hundred and there's the r7 360 in both
builds and there's that power supply as
I was talking about before
power supplies like this they'll say
they're 800 watt or whatever but you'll
see the max there so that won't be
what's RMS which you'll see a capital W
with a 500 watt for example that means
it's 500 watts continuous that's usually
with good pals place so this is a pretty
bad power supply and as I said before
the case is very flimsy so it's time to
start taking all these parts out and
then putting them into these builds here
also on these builds which is really
good - there's an SSD and there's a 2
terabyte hard drive you probably
wondering how much did I pick these up
for of course that's probably a burning
question I got both these PCs I swapped
them for a GTX 1080 and 140 Australian
dollars for both these pcs for 24 inch
1080p monitors and also for keyboard and
mice so I did get an extremely good deal
but we're gonna still see if these
computers completely work out as well
so that took me about eight minutes to
do I've pulled those two pcs apart and I
may use them a little bit later in this
video but we've got here the focus G
where that's up first so we're gonna put
a motherboard in there power supply and
graphics card and I don't know why
there's a pillow there maybe someone was
watching TV on the floor so we've got
this ready let's do it before we do
indeed do it let's take a moment to
check out today's video sponsors story
blocks and on story blocks you can get
access to over 400,000 different images
vectors or illustrations and actually in
today's thumbnail I used one of these
images so you can go to the website
search gradients get a high quality
grade in which I've been using for some
time now and I've also given to tech
deals with a PSD file as well so is
using summer story blocks as images and
he doesn't even know it and then you can
make yourself some high quality footage
also if you're a journalist
this service is really good as well
because you can go search for the image
that you need related to your article
and then use that image completely
royalty-free - so story blocks
definitely have you covered and you get
a 7 day free trial if you use the link
in the description below it's completely
free for 7 days so you can troll the
service see if you like it or not and if
you do decide you like it
and it's only $99 a year which is a
really high quality service for what
you're getting
so I just changed the thermal paste
around and now I usually use alcohol
wipes but I actually can't find them at
the moment so I just did what I call a
spit shine with some tissues and that'll
do perfectly fine
so now it's time to do cable management
and for cable management I'm a pretty
simple guy I just get the zip ties flat
pack things down at the back make sure
everything's relatively neat and then at
the front of the case make sure
everything's looking really good some
people go as far as to individually
manage every single cable that does take
a lot of time I just usually do the
quick and dirty method that gets
aesthetics at the front of the case
so here's the first bill complete now
and looking pretty good I mean those two
sort of fan cables they're sticking out
like a sore thumb I'll probably
rearrange them later but it looks pretty
good for what it's worth because now
while sun's out I do want to bang out
this next build as well and I did start
this elect pretty late in the afternoon
so let's continue on all right so this
case I've just pulled it apart and that
is a lot of plastic but also it does
indeed have four RGB LED fans and you
also get two magnetic
RGB LED strips so the good old code is
looking like it's a pretty good value
already
so we've now finished this second build
and I've taken the side panel off
because it does have the RGB fans
running and they do have the controller
up the top here so you can change the
lighting around and also the fans you
can manually control them the speeds I
think there's three speeds and off so
you can turn them off via the top panel
here so the only two little critiques
about this case would be that the zip
ties included zip ties are ridiculously
small so you'd have to bring your own
zip ties to the table and the RGB LED
strips they're magnetic strips but
there's barely enough metal for them to
stick on to the case so I could only
stick one on to the bottom and the side
here they just fell off the other panels
so besides that though I mean for the
price and the money like adenine is like
60 USD Oh something's hitting really
hard for the money so it's a little bit
outlandish in terms of the looks too but
if you want something with RGB for fans
included and the airflow seems decent
it's not the best airflow but I mean hey
it's not a bad little case for the money
this is the I think it's a coat oh well
that's like something that's like a
Japanese males name or it might be the
rotor I'm not too sure but like either
way I mean they probably wrote I mean
New Age Japanese names road is probably
a name anyway so you know rotor last
name master though not the question I
usually get asked is what about Windows
10 I have an install USB key so I'll
usually just buy the keys off eBay or
wherever for really cheap if they don't
include the key themselves I mean this
PC and the other one also included a
free copy of Windows 10 so they already
installed on the computers that I bought
them with so Windows 10 is usually tied
to the motherboard and since we're using
the same motherboard with the same SSD
we're all good to go so next up here we
have the fractal design focus G and
fractal design they've been around for
years now they make very clean-looking
cases build quality is really good
installations a breeze this one's no
different I'd like to see a little bit
more cable management options so it is a
little bit compact for a case but it
does look extremely neat and that's
probably my own bad
should have got a modular power supply I
spent a little bit more money I could
have got the corsair CX 550 m and
especially with this case I wish I did
because you can probably see those
cables sitting down inside there they're
hiding away there but I wouldn't have
them if I had the Corsair power supply
so but basically with this case you've
got a really hard-hitting case for the
money two fans included at the front and
just a really clean aesthetic for the
money
eighty-five Australian dollars you just
can't go wrong at this price
I mean imagine in the US would be even
cheaper as well so really well done here
I don't know which one I like better the
the rotor or the fractal design focus G
let us know in the comment section below
which one you like better but also
another thing I have to do on this
computer since it has an Nvidia card I
have to change around the drivers clean
up the drivers with ddu which is direct
driver uninstall it really just cleans
out all the previous drivers then you
can install the Nvidia drivers but also
have to tweak it up tune it up and maybe
run some temperature tests maybe let's
test it out quickly the Focus G versus
the the rotor there so while those other
two PC's are stress testing these two
rigs here the shore power supply and the
real low-end case they're not forgotten
about I'm gonna actually reuse them with
those two graphics cards that we got
before the last seven 360s I think they
are and also Madden has donated a heap
of memory to the channel and also to one
terabyte hard drive so we're going to
put them to good use in these builds and
thank you so much for that but we also
have the motherboard the cheap
motherboard that we picked up in
Thailand the h-60 one we're gonna use
that with an i3 and Ivy Bridge i3 and
also another build that I picked up with
an i5 2400 and a Z 68 we're gonna put
both those rigs into these pcs and then
we'll have to really budget entry pcs to
put up the sale too
so there it is there guys two pcs are
finished there two like semi potatoes I
don't know how much I'll sell them for
yet but there's those two done the
fractal case is also done and then we're
actually testing out the little Rhoda
here as well so we're doing the
temperature test now the fractal defined
has been finished the Focus G and now
we're just running this for about half
an hour we're gonna see how they stack
up against each other the two $85
Australian cases so the results are now
in and the fractal define are five after
37 minutes odd number I know scored 85
degrees max and then the Rhoda on the
lowest fan setting that scored 83
degrees so beat it by two degrees kind
of interesting I mean there's not much
in it at all they're both got really bad
stock Intel heatsink fans but the road
is not bad I mean I've never heard of
this brand before 85 Australian dollars
it's hitting hard in terms of value for
money so not a bad case I can recommend
both the cases that I've used here today
they're really gonna make these builds
look really good and they perform really
well too
and yes the ambient temperatures were
the same but also today I've built four
pcs in the afternoon so I started about
two o'clock as I said before and that's
four pcs that are now ready to be sold I
don't know how much I'll put them up for
sale for I'm still gonna think about
that but that is one source of income
for the channel and also big thank you
to the guys who are donating parts
whether they have a semi broken or
broken I can still use a lot of parts
that work and sort of make some magic
happen and make builds for people who
are looking for value for money pcs
especially compared to going out and
buying a new PC so I think ddr4 Ram
prices as well are making the use price
performance markets so much more
attractive as well so I've noticed that
a lot of builds have been selling very
easy as soon as I put them up they get
sold like that it's crazy so that's
awesome that's the source of income and
as I said before the Adsense and the
affiliate links and also the pre-rolls
and stuff like that sometimes they come
along and they all help support the
channel and also another thing I wanted
to talk about was the patron update and
it's very silly especially for those
small one dollar donations essentially
if you guys didn't know they've started
to charge the people who are donating
money which helps us out a lot
thank you guys for the patron support
bit they're charging now 35% extra on
one dollar donations essentially so how
it works is they're charging like 2.9
percent plus 35 cents to the donator and
so on a one dollar donation that's
essentially a 35 percent hike and a lot
of people are just getting angry this is
just too much I mean it's like what some
people were telling me in the UK and
stuff they get charged 20% VAT as well
so that's like 50% service charges just
for a one dollar donation I mean it's
just too much I mean I don't even really
know what to say about it except that I
will be looking in in the next couple of
months I'm just extremely busy at the
moment getting the new studio done but I
will be looking into setting up some
sort of like PayPal subscription service
where PayPal only charge like 2% so I
will look into getting that done for you
guys maybe link it to the website or
something like that because yeah that's
just absurd those charges for what
they're giving is really not worth it
and also what about the new studio
itself it's coming along we're painting
the walls me and dad man we're doing the
colors and all that ourselves of course
saving a bit of money and in the process
we're having a lot of fun just making
the studio the way we want it to it
should be completed probably the end of
this month so we'll take a little bit
longer but that'll just enable me to
have so much more room to work and I
know you guys I know if promise videos
in the past and I just haven't been able
to complete them because I don't have
the room to work with so once I get that
new studio done all those videos are
promised in the past they're going to be
coming and they're going to be coming so
hard the first month I get that studio
done I'm gonna be fulfilling a lot of
those promises so stay tuned but guys
when it comes down to it I'm just flat
out now I'm always working I love the
hustle you guys love the behind the
scenes vlogs that's what a lot of people
are telling me you want to see more
vlogs like this so if you have any
requests any things you want to know
about the dropper come in the comment
section below and I'll try and get that
done so what we did today was for PC
builds in an afternoon
I'm just gotta tune them up maybe take
some photos put them up the sale so
still gonna do that but also as well big
thank you to today's video sponsor story
blocks you can get a 7 day free trial
just click the link in the description
below or $99 a year after that 7 day
trial ends you can
get access to so many different images
vectors and illustrations and with that
said if you guys enjoyed today's video
then be sure to hit that like button and
I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye
you've always got to stay hungry if you
don't stay hungry you're gonna get lazy
also the crypto video is coming very
soon how did I go over the last six
months or five months of mining crypto
currencies I'll make a two part series
and the first part will be hitting the
channel very soon so stay tuned for that
I'll talk about all the profits and the
money and stuff like that in the first
part second part I'll probably talk
about some extra stuff you know there's
this age-old saying that one man's trash
is another man's treasure that's very
true in a lot of cases but around
tacky-ass City one man's trash can be
turned into another man's treasure
it Telstra is that the power guy yeah
just tell him we're with Telstra Telstra
yeah they provide us a really good power
and they also do us the telephone lines
yeah
Telstra provides a very high quality
power - yeah yeah they were Christie's
good yes it's coming from Jamaica
indignant parently brought some
electricity in from Jamaica as well so
it's a special special power</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
