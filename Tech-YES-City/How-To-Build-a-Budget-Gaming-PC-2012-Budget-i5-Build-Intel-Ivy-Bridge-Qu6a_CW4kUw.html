my budget build that i'm going to put
together for about probably about seven
hundred dollars so i'm living in japan
and this is my build two came to about
like sixty thousand yen so yeah I've got
a antec earthwatts 650 green power there
asrock h77 motherboard SS 320 gigabyte
going to use my old DVD + RW Drive I'm
going to use my old ati 58 52 and you
know put in 16 gigabytes of ram and a
water cooler for my i5 3570k a year and
a year that's right just got to say that
again and here's my case this is my case
so it's all going to go in that so yeah
i'm using obviously i'm going to use my
same monitor keyboard mouse speakers and
headphone so i'm using a few parts still
from the from old build but yeah this is
what I'm going to put together today so
yeah it's looking really good so I can't
wait to get it all in so you know I'm
box it all and then I'll get back ok so
not long after we've got the power
supply installed almost ready to go
we've got the SSD Drive in there so
that's just slaughtered in nicely we've
got the DVD Drive ready and we got the
video card that goes in last for me
that's how I usually you should put the
video coding last mobo has the ram reddy
and the processor in there so now I'm
actually going to like going to
rearrange these power cords and then I'm
going to put the motherboard in and
measure I'll tell me
and that needs so I think with this time
I remember compared to last especially
compared with an LGA q75 q9550 processor
this needed a lot of pressure like I
really this here like pressurizing it
down it's a lot more than the LGA sends
them five in my opinion sir yeah yeah
I've fit the motherboard now and see how
many screws it needs okay mother bullets
ready to go inside that little pins
already seven got my screws ready yee-ha
let's do it okay we're just on the last
legs we just finished putting the
motherboard in now now when you tighten
these screws it's important to remember
so i'll just show you you just tighten
them with your wrist so i usually like
to tighten these screws with my wrists
so that's about it like a little even
maybe just your fingers not even your
wrists so remember these are really
sensitive these bolts to cross threading
so yeah just finger tight like little
and as soon as you reach a little you
know a little bit of pressure a little
bit more and then stop do not use your
arm or hmm you know go crazy and rage
because you'll end up just cross
threading the bolt and then that becomes
useless so yeah that's in really tight
now so there's seven holes to screwing
and the motherboard is infirm auugh so
let's get on to the next part okay and
that's one ugly box whoo but we're gonna
try and boot it up see how it goes yeah
and after this so I'm gonna have a list
of all the parts that I bought and how
much they costs so you give you a
general idea on how you can do a budget
build yourself okay let's take a look
get the power button
and we turn the monitor on let's see how
fast of a boot time we get so okay is is
the new box already in windows already
loaded so it's like what may be on there
like 12 seconds boot time or something
so yeah anyway yeah so how much is this
all going to costs if you look at the
list here we have first up the processor
which was about in Japanese yen it was
about knee Mayan which would probably
about two hundred and forty dollars
American next up you have the case which
was cheap I got a fee on 1010 actually
no I got it for sun's angle helped win
which is about forty three dollars after
that comes the SSD which was itchy am
and that cost so about American that
cost about 130 American australian
dollars and then after that i'm using
another hard driver's back up so i'm not
using any more hard drives i ported my
old DVD player so that was free as well
and i bought a new power supply antec
earthwatts 650 watts green power for
about seventy dollars or 5800 yeah and
after that i bought the motherboard
which was about hustling n which is
about a hundred dollars us and then yeah
lastly I got a water cooler for my
processor and that was about yawn Sinan
sounds about fifty dollars so all Arthur
I use my keyboard mouse and I speak is
currently I've got both headphones and
speakers the RAM RAM was 16 gigabytes
and it costs about 6,500 yen which is
about AD us not 16 gigabytes at 1600
megahertz ddr so that's for four sticks
of four gigabytes around
and that's really about it for my build
and its really quick I don't think I
actually needed it but yeah the video
card and obviously the video cards free
so obviously I didn't need to upgrade
but I wanted to and say yeah if I'm
going to put up a video soon on how well
this processor overclocks and then i'll
upload it guys if you got any questions
leave it below and of course subscribe
