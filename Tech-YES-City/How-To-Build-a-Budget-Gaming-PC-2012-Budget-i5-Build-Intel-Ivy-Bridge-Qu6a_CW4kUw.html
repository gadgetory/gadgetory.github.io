budget build then I'm gonna put together
for about probably about $700 so I'm
living in Japan and this is my build
came to about like 60,000 yen so yeah
I've got a check
that's what's 650 GreenPower there
asrock h77 motherboard SSD 120 gigabyte
I'm gonna use my old DVD + RW Drive
I'm gonna use my old ATI 5 850 still and
you know put in 16 gigabytes of RAM and
a water cooler for my I 5 3 5 70 K a
year and a year that's right just gotta
say that again
and here's my case this is my case so
it's all gonna go in that so yeah I'm
using obviously I'm gonna use my same
monitor keyboard and mouse speakers and
headphone so I'm using a few parts still
from the from all build but yeah this is
what I'm gonna put together today so
yeah it's looking really good so I can't
wait to get it all in so you know I'm
box it all and then I'll get back okay
so not long after we've got the power
supply installed almost ready to go
we've got the SSD drive in there so
that's just slotted in nicely we've got
the DVD drive ready and we got the video
card that goes in last for me that's how
I usually you should put the video
coding last mobo has the RAM ready and
the processor in there so now I'm
actually gonna like I'm gonna rearrange
these power cords and then I'm gonna put
the motherboard in and measure out how
many
that needs so I think with this time I
remember compared to last especially
compared with analogy a q77 5q 9550
processor this there's a lot of pressure
like ireally this here like pressurizing
it down it's a lot more than the LGA 771
and see how many screws it needs
okay mother bullets ready to go in sup
at little pins already the seven got my
screws ready yeehaw let's do it okay
we're just on the last legs
we just finished putting the motherboard
in now now when you tighten these screws
it's important to remember so I'll just
show you you just tighten them with your
wrist so I usually like to tighten these
screws with my wrist so that's about it
like a little even maybe just your
fingers not even your wrist so remember
these are really sensitive these bolts
to cross threading so yeah just finger
tight like little and as soon as you
reach a little you know a little bit of
pressure just a little bit more and then
stop do not use your arm or I mean you
know go crazy and rage because you'll
end up just cross threading the Boulton
and that becomes useless
so yeah that's in really tight now so
those seven holes to screwing and the
motherboard is in firm a you year so
let's get onto the next part okay and
that's one ugly box whew but we're gonna
try and boot it up see how it goes yeah
and after this I'm gonna have a list of
all the parts that I bought and how much
they costs so give you a general idea on
how you can do a budget build yourself
okay let's take a look hit the power
button
and we turn the monitor on let's see how
fast of a boot time we get so okay this
is the new box already in Windows
already loaded so it's like what may be
on there when 12 seconds boot time or
something so yeah anyway yeah so how
much is this all going to costs if you
look at the list here we have first up
the processor which was about in
Japanese yen it was about nee Mayan
which would probably about two hundred
and forty dollars American
next up you have the case which was
cheap I got a figure on sent in actually
no I got it for sun's angle have twin
which is about forty three dollars after
that comes the SSD which was itchy iron
and that cost so about American that
cost about a hundred and thirty American
Australian dollars and then after that
I'm using another hard drive is back up
so I'm not using any more hard drives i
ported my old DVD player so that was
free as well and I bought it in your
power supply antic Earth Watts six
hundred and fifty Watts green power for
about $70 or five thousand eight hundred
yeah and after that I bought the
motherboard which is about HUS seinen
which is about a hundred dollars u.s.
and then yeah at lastly I got a water
cooler for my processor and that was
about yon sinan sounds about fifty
dollars so all Arthur I use my keyboard
mouse and my speakers currently I've got
both headphones and speakers the RAM RAM
was sixteen gigabytes and it costs about
six thousand five hundred yen which is
about a dus not sixteen gigabytes at
1600 megahertz ddr2 that's for four
sticks of four gigabytes around
and that's really about it for my build
and it's really quick um I don't think I
actually needed it but yeah the video
card and obviously the video cards free
so obviously I didn't need to upgrade
but I wanted to and so yeah if I'm gonna
put up a video soon on how well this
processor overclocks and then I'll
upload it guys if you got any questions
leave it below and of course subscribe
keep bronies going you you so these out
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
