is perfect for small business owners or
even people at home who need something
that provides a heap of functionality
and can work like a typical nap and that
it can back up your data automatically
though also work as the home security
Homestead to PC and also stream to all
your devices on the network though with
a price tag of 305 USD or 435 Ozzie is
it worth your money let's find out
welcome back is takia city in the tf2 5
1 a is a network attached storage
solution from a company called Q nap
which is essentially a standalone unit
that features of the core or pun
intended a seller on an 3060 dual-core
cpu running at 1.6 gigahertz and this
model supports 1080p 60 Hertz output has
three USB inputs has a USB quick sync
connection which can be connected to a
computer to allow the user interface to
be accessed just like it otherwise could
over the 2 1 Gigabit Ethernet connection
but with this model you can accommodate
two of your own hard drives put them in
and the QNAP will do the rest for you in
terms of setting things up with the ts2
51a having the option to support j baud
aka just a bunch of disks raid 0 or raid
one I had here loan samples from Seagate
the 10 gigabyte iron wolf or in this
case wolves which are dedicated and
optimized for nash storages so backup
purposes in mind I wanted to test them
out in raid 1 and when setting up the
NASA was incredibly straightforward and
easy giving you the option to install
apps that you would want to use and has
the options to backup share and access
photos and movies files and music from
any device that is essentially connected
to the internet and has access to the
server the model here features for you
at the ddr3l memory and has the option
to upgrade to up to 8 gigabytes if you
need a for heavy virtualization which is
a very powerful tool on this model and
this can be set up pretty easily and
quickly and it does have model support
for Windows 10 Mac Linux android x86
virtualization and of course this device
can be accessed by a smartphone too with
the ability to even notice
aiyoo of incoming updates or if others
have access to the Nass by created login
though with a heap of different apps
available I wanted to see how the TS 251
a could benefit my workstation needs and
also see what apps I really liked and
why firstly the ability to automatically
backup data on raid one configuration
confirmed this is easily done via the
App Center where you can even upload and
think automatically to a variety of
cloud service and also scheduled
automatic backups on your computer and
to the selected cloud server although it
did take around 20 minutes to backup 22
gigabytes worth of archive files just
via the Gigabit Ethernet connection so
your transfer speeds will be limited to
one gigabit per second there is also the
option to transcode videos and have them
readily streamable for use on any device
connected to the TS 2 v 1a which is
incredibly handy if you'd like to use
the NASS as a media stream box though I
found on the fly transcoding to be quite
laggy at 720p and 1080p though at 480p
and below was very smooth you can also
connect this device to a TV and this is
where the included remote comes in handy
as you can use it in conjunction with a
keyboard and mouse to essentially use it
as a desktop and home theater PC having
the option to play music watch movies
and even create and edit Word and Excel
documents via the liberate Office app
there is even the option to use bit turn
those search results were pretty limited
though of course there will be those
that ask can it play games well with the
hardware it has in it I wouldn't expect
it to play crysis 3 though it can play
games with old potato graphics in this
case it has a game called TTD
pre-installed which is still pretty cool
and the most I saw this whole time on
the power drill the 20 Watts from the
wall and that was with two drives
installed even while playing a video so
it is very power efficient too though
other cool features were the
surveillance station which you can even
plug up to four cameras and have them
live monitoring and in this instance I
had a logitech camera and can have it
perform remote viewing great if you want
to see if your stuff has been stolen
while you're on holiday or even great
for things like monitoring your children
whilst they're sleeping to make sure
they don't get up to any mischief other
things that I liked about this unit was
that it was very easy to use and setup
so I think the target demographic
Epicurus basically everyone who needs a
very versatile nasa HD PC streaming and
virtualization box where there are
options to perform even more complex
commands there is also the option to
easily set up this device and have it
work as a reliable Math &amp;amp; Media Center
quite easily though it may sound perfect
up until this point there were a few
things I found tedious with the TS 251 a
with boot times being very slow
it took about seven minutes for this
unit to boot into the desktop menu and
while there is an included SD slot
reader and upon inserting my memory
cards that I use for video recording I
was prompted with the message to
purchase an additional license in order
to read the file stored on the memory
card I wasn't too pleased about this
especially since the developer of the
software is QNAP themselves I'd like to
see this license included with the
product for free also when transcoding
large videos to 1080p they did take
quite a while this is maybe it's ask
that you would like to schedule before
you go to bed though besides all this
the unit worked very well and I thought
the build quality was pretty good too
having the option to easily remove
replace and insert drives and also the
cosmedix power efficiency and size were
all the big plus or small in this case
however there is an included 65 watt AC
adapter which if they did a future
revision I would like to see that
integrated into the unit itself
therefore 305 USD or 435 Aussie you get
a unit that is very capable as grade
easy to use a great assortment of apps
and functionality and allows you to add
in your own drives which in this case
the C gates did a fantastic job even
when I was deliberately shaking the
device it still worked so kudos to
vibration control implemented in the
iron warp drive anyway guys that's about
it for today let me know in the comment
section below what you think of the QNAP
ts2 v 1a is it something that you would
need in your home or office or are you
just the one computer kind of guy would
love to read your comments and opinion
as always and i'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
