2.5 inch SATA SSD drive well if you are
then you've come to the right place
because today I have five different SSDs
that I'm comparing and you guys have
been requesting every time I have a
crucial Drive come through here you want
to see it compared against the Samsung
equivalents so today I've got the 860
Evo from Samsung the one terabyte
version going up against the mx-5
hundred one terabyte version and I've
also thrown in the pro models the 830
Pro and the 840 pro to see how they fare
against these latest two SSDs and of
course the previous generation from
crucial def MX 300 drive which was the
first introduction of their TLC based
drives on their MX lineup the MX 500
doesn't really change that but it does
introduce a new variant and that is the
64 layer 3d NAND technology
they've also switched it up from the
Marvell controller which will sorely be
missed here on the channel and they've
gone with a silicon motion controller
now silicon motion are hitting the
market very hard for controllers you'll
find them on a lot of MVM a budget
drives that are really fast and they're
obviously giving good value and since
everyone's using them they must be very
competitive as an independent vendor
providing controllers to companies like
crucial but of course onto that main
question of how will these five drives
perform let's find out
welcome back to tech yes City this is
brand coming to you guys today with that
five-way SSD showdown now recently
crucial of sending the MX 500 drive and
I'm just going to pull up some of the
numbers here for you the performance
numbers are impressive
now as I said in the intro they've gone
from that Marvel control up which of
course when I've tested it in the past
has been a very impressive controller
they're going with the silicon motions
2200 series controller and after doing
some tests on this it is very impressive
as well it's so impressive to the point
now where Samsung actually have a worthy
competitor in the 2.5 inch SATA SSD
market the 860 Pro going neck-and-neck
with the M X 500 these are the two main
drives that I'm going to focus on here
today and of course I've thrown in the
other results here of the 512 gigabyte
840 and 830 Pro and you can see over the
years how things have aged and they've
gotten better and better in the SSD
market not only if prices come down but
we can see here with the MX 500 with 522
megabytes per second of reeds and 466
megabytes per second of write speeds
came very close with the 522 of the
Samsung Evo 860 and 512 on the writes
now inputs/outputs per second the
maximum here was about 97 thousand on
the MX 580 4500 on the rights and then
comparing that to the Evo that scored a
little bit higher in ninety seven
thousand five hundred and the 85
thousand two hundred so Samsung do use
their own in-house controller as opposed
to crucial who are outsourcing it from
silicon motion and moving on here with
the temperature test as requirements get
better over the years
so do temperatures and of course power
consumption this enabled the MX 500 with
its aluminium casing to perform really
well on these tests scoring and tying in
with the Samsung 860 Evo both at 38
degrees this is with an ambient
temperature of 30 degrees might add and
now how I stress these is I do a 4k
intense right I just load this thing up
with 10 gigabytes of continuous 4k
writes which really stresses the drives
and the temperatures were really good on
both though of course speaking of those
4k read and writes which surveys
estimate that the average
user would use about 90% of their SSD or
even more in 4k random reading rights
here we saw a Thai 43 megabytes per
second on the read sides on both these
drives and then 113 on the MX 500 versus
a hundred and 18 on the 860 Evo 1
terabyte so a slight edge here to the
Evo but what about the simulated
threaded benchmarks this is where the MX
500 scored a little victory coming in
with 378 megabytes per second versus 374
and then 329 versus 333 and then to top
all that off the total scores in a s SSD
came in at 1200 and 16 versus 1224 so
really when it came down to the numbers
both the MX 500 and the 860 Evo were
performing neck-and-neck this was really
close and it's great to see MX 500 right
up there in terms of performance as you
guys all the time when I look at SSDs
and drugs you always tell me about how
good Samsung's lineup is and to me
personally when I'm doing client builds
I actually do use Samsung drives a lot
because they're cloning software is
phenomenal and so when a client gets a
drive say for instance they're going
from a hard drive to an SSD it's so easy
to use that Samsung software and this is
where I'm gonna critique crucial a
little bit they're still using the
acronym software I have had problems
with this in the past they're using it
this time around it did work okay though
I'd like to see crucial use their own
in-house software as the executive
software that they've recently released
is phenomenal looks great it allows you
to do things like monitor and also
optimize your drive and even receive
firmware updates for latest improvements
if there are any bugs introduced with
the MX 500 from its release date though
of course what about the MX 300 and the
840 and 830 Pro well of course they are
a little bit dated in today's standards
so if you still have one of these drives
you're going to have a really good
experience as when I look at things when
I've used hard drives in the past versus
SSDs I haven't really noticed a big
difference between an SSD and a better
SSD versus a SSD versus a hard drive
there's a massive difference when you
step it up from a hard drive to an SSD
and nvme drive you will notice the
differences in those massive speeds when
it comes to things like using maybe 100
gigabytes at one time and dropping
although
files into Adobe Premiere Pro otherwise
known as a scratch disk but for most
people who are just burning up their
computer want to boot up their games
really fast
have a very snappy experience then the
neccessity like the MX 500 or the 860
Evo are going to serve you extremely
well and this is where we get down to
the price so the MX 500 is coming in
around 260 dollars for the one terabyte
the one that I have here very impressive
very hard-hitting price the Evo is about
$40 more expensive now they both carry a
5 year warranty which is phenomenal and
the Evo I believe has six hundred
terabytes written and the mx518 undred
terabytes written so they are both
extremely generous terabyte written
ratings of course if you're putting this
thing in a server then you might want to
go with the Samsung Evo six hundred
terabytes though is huge I don't even
know me editing 4k videos day-in day-out
would use that over five years so both
of them offer a really good warranty and
of course the 860 Evo steps it up over
the 850 Evo by offering four times the
amount of terabytes written the one more
thing we're going to talk about as these
drives go over the years and I will
point out that I absolutely love the
build quality of the 830 Pro it's got a
machined finish on it looks absolutely
phenomenal now you may be wondering what
about the old-school drives that use the
MLC NAND flash banks versus now the Evo
and the MX 500 which you're using TLC
and what I can say here is that from the
results that I've seen in the warranties
offered TLC especially the 64 layer 3d
nine that crucial is using that's their
in-house design and also Samsung they're
using their v-nand they're both
phenomenal the performance figures are
there the warranty and the terabytes
writtens there to back it up so I can
only really see this as a win for the
consumer I don't really see the need now
to go with MLC personally what I see
here is just TLC has come such a long
way now where the performance is there
and we pull up the access times and we
can see that the access times on both
the MX 500 and the 860 Evo are the best
here in today's benchmarks a really big
step up for the mx-5
the MX 300 as well but what we're seeing
here is just performances there the
consistency is there as well the MX 500
and both the X 60 Evo perform
phenomenally in the consistency tests
Sophia this is a hundred gigabytes to by
the way very intense test so if you're
dumping a hundred gigabytes of file from
your SD card for example 4k video camera
footage you're not going to notice any
slowdowns on both these SSDs here but
another thing as well is those access
times they've gotten a lot better so and
the warranty is there to back it up so
the TLC in 2018 or at least in 2017 late
2017 has been extremely good and it's
come to the stage now where it's a
seriously good contender especially for
your hard-earned dollars and for the
price per gigabyte there's some other
last-minute things with the MX 500
itself it has 16 banks at least the one
terabyte model of around about 62
gigabyte NAND flash banks it's also got
a ddr3 512 megabyte burst Bank connected
to the silicon Motion's controller I
believe that is double the size of the
previous MX 300 ultimately when it comes
down to it is the mx518 the answer is by
far yes it's a very solar drive great to
see crucial really stepping up their
game especially from their previous
model everything's improved and I even
liked the MX 300 as well I thought that
was a great Drive they've stepped it up
a notch and they're basically making it
as good as it gets
the 860 Evo as well you guys love
Samsung and I know why because it's a
seriously good drive as well especially
for the money so both drives here on the
bench I can recommend them both they
both have a support for encryption as
well if that's something you need so
there's no big difference between both
the 860 Evo and the MX 500 for me to
justify getting one over the other
except this does come in $40 cheaper the
arcanist software did work this time
around it is good though The Magicians
software from Samsung they're cloning
software does have a track record of
working exceptionally well so both
drives guys it's up in the air I would
probably go with the MX 500 being $40
cheaper it's really good value for money
crucial are definitely hitting it hard
and I'd love reading your thoughts and
opinions as always so let me know in the
comment section below which one would
you get and why and I'll catch you guys
in another tech video very soon peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
