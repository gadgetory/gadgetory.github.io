at the AORUS X570 booth here.
(beep)
Here we are at the AORUS
booth in 2019's Computex.
This is a pretty big one because
we have some new
motherboards here from AORUS,
and these are not just new motherboards.
They're pretty much doing something that
no one else can do in the industry.
With that aside, we'll take a look
at the first board here, the Flagship.
This is the X570 AORUS
XTREME 16 direct phases,
and what they mean by that
is they're using no doublers.
And so they're told this
increases the efficiency.
It also helps with the overclocks
and they've got a 85% heat sink coverage
on this whole motherboard,
all interconnected via heat pipes,
which means this is the only
board I've seen at Computex
that doesn't need a heat sink fan
to cool down that new PCIe Gen 4
integrated in the chips here,
which does need cooling on
practically every other board,
but also going through the list here,
we've got Aquantia 10
gigabytes per second NIC
also got Wi-Fi 802.11 ax
which speeds up to 2400
megabytes per second.
You got Bluetooth five support,
triple M.2 PCIe gen four by four support.
This thing is an absolute beast
as well as having a heat sink
on the back of the board.
This is pretty much the
Flagship of Flagships
and those heat sinks as well have fins.
So if you want to put
a fan on top of that,
you're gonna see the lowest
VRM temperatures possible.
With that aside, let's go
through the rest of the boards
and see what AORUS has cooking.
(electronic music)
Next up here we have the AORUS master
and I'm told this is going to be
somewhere in between
the more popular choice.
So we got 14 direct phases
similar to the AORUS extreme,
except that is an EATX
this is an ATX form factor.
You've got heat sinks,
you do have a heat sink
fan down the bottom.
Similar features except this time
you're featuring a Realtek 2.5
gigabyte solution for the NIC,
but you still have that 802.11 AX.
Now, one thing I will point out is that
all the boards that feature
Wi-Fi on the X570 lineup
will also feature that
.11 AX Wi-Fi speeds.
You don't have to worry about
getting slow Wi-Fi anymore.
X570 has it all integrated
into the chip set.
Now as for pricing and availability,
I'm not exactly sure when these
motherboards will be released.
I am told just like I
was told at other booths,
that these will be
releasing slightly before
the CPUs are released.
As for the pricing I will update
you guys as soon as I know,
and as for review you
know what to expect from
Tech YES City.
However, in front of me here
is the AORUS Ultra X570.
So a little bit of a step down from
the second in charge,
and this one features a 12 plus two
power design here on the VRM,
and it's got the IR
digital PWM controller.
Of course, those having the direct phases,
where all those get a signal
from the PWM controller themselves.
This one may be using doublers.
I'm not sure don't quote me on that,
but we've also got of
course PCIe Gen four,
Intel gigabyte support,
dual M.2 PCIe Gen four by four.
So these things are going to run fast.
Now, speaking of the Gen four by four,
AORUS did demonstrate inside their SSDs
with the Phison controls
the e16 controllers
that now support those Gen four speeds.
So you can expect to get those speeds
out of the M.2 slots.
On top of that if you
wanna go crazy enough,
you can get the 16 speed slot,
where I saw the speeds were
going up to 15 gigabytes per second,
transfers both on the rate and the rides.
And then moving through the lineup here,
we've got the AORUS Pro X570.
This one here does take away the Wi-Fi.
So you don't get the .11 AX solution.
Of course, not everyone
needs Wi-Fi integrated
on their motherboard.
So gigabyte is sort of
segmenting the price performance,
but still sticking to the VRM.
That's the most important thing,
when it comes to overclocking on X570.
I mean if you don't want to overclock
you'd probably step it
down to a cheaper chip set.
But what we've got right here
is something with 12 plus
two phase power design.
True power, I'm told,
and that's 14 phases in total,
which is going to definitely overclock
something like a 16 core, for example,
which I am told that these boards
have been running through
the paces on those 16 cores,
and these boards can definitely handle it,
with easy VRM temperatures,
without even needing a
heat sink fan, for example.
For NVME support we've
got PCIe Gen four by four
dual heat sinks on that too.
So you can get those cooled down,
make sure they're nice and cool,
especially with Gen four,
coz they may run a bit
hotter than Gen three.
So having a heat sink this time
around is pretty important.
Now the difference between
this one and this one of course
is you've got three heat
sink supports and Wi-Fi,
as opposed to this board right here,
which does cut down a
little bit on features,
but you can expect it to come in with a
more value-orientated price point.
And now moving down in the stack,
we've got next up here
the X570 AORUS Elite.
This one takes away
simply the M.2 heat sinks.
So you get one of them,
so great for a gamer who only needs
a single NVME SSD solution,
but also take away the
fin heat sink design
on the previous AORUS Pro.
Speaking of the AORUS Elite,
you can look at this with 14
phases still intact on the VRM.
You can expect this to be hitting hard
in terms of those guys who
want to get into overclocking
but want an X570 board
but don't need the extended features
on the higher tiered boards,
but still wanna get great value for money.
Now we're onto a very special motherboard.
This little guy right
here is the AORUS X570 LG.
(beep)
Jokes aside, the real naming of this
is the X570 I AORUS Pro Wi-Fi.
Now with the Wi-Fi, you
get the 802.11 AX solution
for those really fast speeds.
You've also got an eight
phase power design here
and that I'm told will
support the 16 core.
How much it overclocks
remains to be seen, but
interestingly enough you've got
this little cute heat sink on this board
with a 30 ml fan,
but also underneath that it
is cooling and NVME drive,
and then on the rear
you get an extra slot.
So, if you wanna have two NVME
PCIe Gen four by four slots
you've got them on this board,
and you may notice on the back also,
heat sink encompassing
the back of the board,
not just for aesthetics
but also for cooling.
And all these boards that I've seen so far
also have integrated input output shields,
which is something that's really good.
I like this addition that's
coming into these motherboards,
makes things very clean,
and of course in the future
you know why I love the
integrated IO shields.
But I'm not gonna say it in this video.
And the last up in the stack,
is not an AORUS board.
It's actually a Gigabyte X570.
It's called the X570 Gaming X,
features a 12 phase power design.
So 10 plus two intercel,
and you've also got support of course,
just like the other boards.
PCEi NVME Gen four by four
and you've got two of those slots,
one of those carrying a heat sink,
as well as the chip set heat sink
carrying a fan of its own down the bottom,
as well as carrying a gloss black
and gray theme for the aesthetics.
So, this thing looks
like to has everything
for someone who just wants
to get into PC gaming,
maybe get a 12 core.
The 3900X, just whack it in there
and start playing games.
Get those boost clocks
and you're good to go.
Also on the back here are
the integrated IO shields
just like the AORUS boards,
but they are going away with optical out,
as opposed to the other boards
which all have that optical out there,
if you wanna connect it to something
like a 5.1 surround sound.
And lastly guys, closing out the video,
AORUS is overhauling all their biases,
or so I'm told.
So a lot of things are getting
overhauled around here,
but also on that note there is a promise.
Two game is a gigabyte in AORUS.
They're gonna make the best boards,
and now something else we saw
was the NVME solutions coming in house
from Gigabyte and AORUS
that are gonna provide
PCIe Gen four support
over that bandwidth.
So that's gonna saturate
that, looking forward to that.
And we've got the heat
sink right here on the NVME
drive right beside me.
Anyway, guys that about
wraps everything up here
at the AORUS suite for 2019's Computex.
I hope you guys enjoyed this video.
I'm looking forward to your comments
in the comment section below,
telling us what your favorite
board here in the stack was
as well as these NVME drives.
Are you digging them?
And big thank you for your time,
coming out here showing us all
these motherboards here today
and if you enjoyed this one
be sure to hit that like button,
and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon.
But if you wanna see
more Computex coverage
then make sure you hit that sub button,
hit that bell notification
to get the videos the moment they drop,
and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon.
Peace out for now
(off mic) You gotta say bye.
- Bye.
