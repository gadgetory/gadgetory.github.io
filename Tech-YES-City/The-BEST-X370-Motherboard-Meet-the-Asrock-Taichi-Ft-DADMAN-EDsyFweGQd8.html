this computer passcode of my asthma
today it's time to take a look at the X
370 Tai Chi motherboard from asrock and
it's supposed to be one of the most
popular x 374th to get though is it the
one to get let's find out
welcome back and without wasting any
more of your time let's get into the
most important part the price the X 370
will set you back around 200 USD or if
you are nas it will set you back 316
Australian dollars so what do you get
for this money well the first is in an
incredibly solid vrm it has a six plus
two phase power design and when doubling
these phases you get twelve plus four
split between the V Corps and SOC
voltage the Infineon ir35 to zero one
digital PWM is supporting the six plus
two phase mode and it is one of the best
digital PWM s currently out there bar
none each channel in the phase is sent
to the dual driver chip that then
outputs to two Texas Instruments CSD 870
35 euro q5d next fat MOSFETs the MOSFETs
are rated at 25 amps at 90 percent
efficiency and have a 40 amp maximum
capacity the inductors are high-quality
60 amp parts and the capacitors are 12
kfp Japanese capacitors the memory also
has its own two phases powered by the
same aforementioned next sets so all up
it is a very solid VRM especially for
overclockers using air and or water for
24/7 stable use now moving on to the
onboard audio you get a Realtek LC 1220
DAC and a DC and for the amplification
there is a Texas Instruments ni NE 5 5 3
2 amp which did a great job of powering
my v-moda headphones actually too good
with the max levels being very loud and
as to the other standard tests like
crosstalk levels this is where the bomb
performed extremely well to having
incredibly low levels of crosstalk
meaning you get really good channel
separation and the
I port in is also very solid with low
levels of noise and on that note I will
let you guys take a listen
here's a quick mic in test on the X 370
taichi's mic in port with the v-moda
boom Pro and also on that note if you
guys are streaming or you want to do any
work with recording from that mic import
then this is what it will sound like as
for overclocking this board had no
problems getting my 1800 X - 4 point 0
to 5 gigahertz at one point 4 volts and
did so with temperatures that were
extremely good on the vrm heatsink where
I measured with the IR gun a temperature
of around 40 degrees Celsius in a 25
degree ambience with 20 mins in aida64
keep in mind though that this is a well
ventilated case with good airflow
looking over the motherboard the
standout features are that there's two
USB three and two USB two front out
ports a doctor debug LED readout - RGB
and one AMD LED fan headers to PC a 3/16
speed slot they connect directly to the
CPUs PCIe controller and one PCIe 216
speed slot and two PCIe - one speed
slots that connect via the chipset there
are also two MDOT - nvme ports with one
having support for both side of 3 and PC
eigh and the lower having only support
for PCIe connectivity there's also five
for pin fan headers always support for
PWM control via the BIOS and speaking of
the bus it is quite good I have found
since I first received the board that
asrock have improved it quite a lot
there is now options to save
overclocking profile and also manually
overclock your cpu via 25 megahertz
increment in the manual peace states I
have a full rise in overclocking
tutorial up here which you guys can
check out anytime there's also the
fantastic fan tuning software within the
box that works really easy and simple
once you get the hang of it with the 1.9
4 beta by off - I'm running 64 gigabytes
of ddr4 memory and dual channel - and
haven't had any problems since also on
the Box you can control the heatsink
located towards the bottom of the
motherboard which does feature RGB LED
lighting for input/output you get a
drumroll wafer a clear CMOS thank the
heavens I love this little button which
if you click it once
we'll reset everything back to the fault
so overclocking is made very easy with
this button and there's also six USB 3
ports 13.1 type A and 13.1 types C
there's also the Intel 2-1 180 gigabit
NIC with Mac's
2 Q supported and Intel Jul been AC 3
168 wireless module and Bluetooth 4.2
support there's also the optical outline
for 7.1 channel audio support and a mic
and line-in lineout and headphone out
jack as well as analog 5.1 surround
support so now it's finally on to
conclusion time and first I'll get out
the only negative I have with this
motherboard and that is that it only
features a single bus I would have loved
to have seen a dual bias implementation
though this is a trend that I've seen
practically on all x3 motherboards upon
initial release and I am impressed with
the continual BIOS updates that I have
seen coming out which has improved not
only performance but also stability and
asrock have added in options like
overclocking profiles and overall the
vrm onboard audio and dual band wireless
and included 2-1 180 NIC all do a great
job of providing a very solid
motherboard overall one that I can
highly recommend to anyone looking to
get a solid board for overclocking and
having a great end-user experience I
think as Rock has nailed it with the X
370 Taichi and I think it is current
price it's actually really good value as
well anyway guys I hope you enjoyed
today's video and let me know in the
comments section below what you think of
the next 370 Taichi I personally think
it looks awesome
and it performs awesome too and I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon also if you haven't already
don't forget to hit that like button and
subscribe and I'll peace out for now bye
oh that is an ugly cable gone cable
management whatever is not on the camera
looks good that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
