crucial latest budget
SST offering and this is the BX 200
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
tech SC this is brian coming back to you
guys today with a review of the crucial
BX 200 I'll be reviewing the 480
gigabyte SSD variant I'll also be doing
some quick tests here through a SSD and
HD tune Pro and telling you guys what I
think of the performance however until
then we'll quickly go over the features
of this drive and what's included in the
box as soon as you get the package in
you'll notice that it comes packaged
pretty well for a budget entry drive you
also get a little bracket there and the
Akron estroux software program there
which is really good if you wish to
clone programs I've actually got a
tutorial where I use this exact program
on cloning however looking at the drive
itself it is a 2.5 inch solution there
and it is only 70 millimeters thick so
it's very light you've got an all steel
construction on the case which also
works as a heat sink for the actual
controller on the SSD going into the
drive itself out we can see there we've
got 60 gigabyte Bank there of TLC flash
there which is 16 millimeter flash from
micron we've also got these silicon
motions sm 2 to 6 v controller on there
as well as the fact that we've got a 6
cubic case of DRAM and SLC memory there
for caching the drive for faster read
and writes moving on to the back of the
PCB you've just got some empty brackets
there since is the 480 gigabyte model
which allows this drive to come in 960
gigabyte variants so quickly moving back
to the drive there you have the BX
branding with the crucial logo on there
also on the side there you have screw
mounts or screw holes if you wish to
mount this to an adapter also on the
bottom you have screw drives if you wish
to just directly screw it into your case
so quickly moving on to some figures
here with the BX 200 it's scored a 965
points in a SSD so coming in quite a
little bit under there under the MX 100
and also the Samsung 850 Evo and these
are smaller variants might have had as
well and also the it did beat the BX 100
by about 60 points I managed to see a
score of 897 in
that particular benchmark also quickly
looking at the inputs and outputs scores
they're the max input-output score I
recorded on this drive with seventy two
thousand four hundred and seventeen on
the red side and on the right side
seventy eight thousand one hundred and
eighty one the bit contrasting that to
the predecessor the BX 100 it's called
sixty nine thousand five hundred and
thirteen and sixty nine thousand seven
hundred and seventy respectively however
only MX 100 side of things we could see
that blowing as high as ninety six
thousand three hundred and sixty eight
and seventy four thousand six hundred
and twenty six however it is important
to note when I did some big file
transfers here I noticed that the
performance severely tanked after five
or six gigabytes on the right sides
they're going to as low as 80 megabytes
per second consistently this is severely
or a severe drop in performance here
even losing to some hard disk drives
which should not be happening on an SSD
now when we contrast this to the
predecessor of the bx 100 which uses the
same silicon motion controller that
performed a lot better over bigger file
writes also one thing i will mention
about the bx 200 however is that the
right consistency in that first group of
performance figures was a little bit
better than the pressor predecessor the
bx 100 so we can see that the silicon
motions controller has improved somewhat
so in collision what can I say about the
bx 200 well I'm actually not impressed
at all with the performance of this
drive I mean in ways I think it's
backwards from the back 100 and it's
also still under the MX 100 there and
this is a product that's almost coming
on two years later so I'd really like to
see crucial get back on their game with
their budget line series of SSDs and get
back on top which when they released the
it makes 100 they were on top everyone
was just recommending these drives I was
blown away by the MX 100 at the time
especially the 256 gigabyte variant
however I will quickly mention the
pricing on this SSD we have for the 240
gigabyte variant their 159 AUD which is
a little bit more in NZD also the 480
gigabyte variant there will be 289 a you
do and then the 960 gigabyte version
will set you back a little bit more so
the pricing is definitely there from the
retail standpoint
expect to pay a little bit less from the
actual retails itself as we always know
street prices generally are a little bit
cheaper than the retail prices though
honestly at this price I have to give
this product two and a half stars out of
five as I just simply was not impressed
with the performance even though the
initial figures there from s SSD scores
were pretty good and the right
consistency in those initial fire
transfers were pretty good and it was a
step up in that regard from the BX 100
the overall performance was just simply
lackluster especially compared to the BX
100 and the MX 100 and take into account
that the competitors products have
stepped it up a lot especially in terms
of value for money anyway guys that's
about it for me today guys if you love
these concise and precise reviews then
you know what to do hit that thumbs up
button and I'll be coming back to you
guys in another tech review very soon
