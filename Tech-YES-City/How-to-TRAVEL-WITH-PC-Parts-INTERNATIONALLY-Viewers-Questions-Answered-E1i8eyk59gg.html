use PC parts hunt we did pick up some
really good bargains before that we went
to Austria and got some really good
deals as well now there was a really
good question that came up in the
comments and they asked essentially what
do I do with all these PC components
that I get on deals and do they help
fund the trips and if so is there any
chips that I've got as well as some
other questions in the thread about what
do I do going through customs
so today or at least tonight I'll run
you guys through all the parts that were
in the suitcase and what I intend to do
with those parts so you kind of get a
real-world example of how I do things
and how I think as well as how I travel
in terms of deal hunting and also doing
business and mixing leisure and pleasure
all in one
so first things first we've got all the
parts here on the table all the deals I
also even picked up this one here which
I got a friend to pick up x79 board 32
gigabytes of RAM it's a pretty much the
best x79 board you can get the rampage
extreme so we've got that on a deal for
I think 500 Australian dollars but
that's going to be my new motherboard
I'm gonna piece in another 32 gigabytes
and make it a 64 gear by editing rig and
see if that can replace my main rig so
that'll be a video coming to the channel
very soon but let's take a look at some
of these graphics cards for instance
I've got a GTX 680 got that for an
absolute bargain GTX 10 63 gigabyte this
one here we pulled out of that rig that
we went to Japan so I'll put the links
in the description if you guys want to
see exactly what I paid for all these
parts in the deals hunts but besides
that for instance let's take a look this
GTX 980 I think I picked this up for
around about 200 us which is a pretty
solid price for a 980 now what do I do
with this essentially I put it in a rig
so I find one of those i7 rigs or maybe
an i5 rig but I think this is more
suited towards an i7 rig try and piece
out like I've got here 16 gigabytes of
ddr3 memory make a whole build and then
I'll add value on top of that because
we've got this for so cheap we got this
for so cheap we pick up all these other
deals for so cheap we then put that in a
gaming PC that we make look really good
with wd-40 and as much as some other
people take a stab at me and have a
laugh that wd-40 makes the build look
like brand new we've got an awesome
gaming PC it's tuned everything we've
put together deals here deals there
deals everywhere help us sell this whole
PC in one go now we've also got for
instance the GTX 780 this will be coming
very soon in a used PC build you'll see
on the channel got this again for
another bargain we whack it in gaming
pcs and we add a lot of value now of
course I could turn around and for
instance this GTX 980 Strix absolutely
phenomenal card I'd love to look at this
thing that feels great we've got this
for a bargain as well I could turn
around and flip this individually but
honestly it's a lot of effort if I
wanted to sell all these components
individually it just takes so much time
I'd have to do all these listings all
these ads take all these phone
and all these messages when I can just
whack it in a gaming PC and be done with
it
so that's the general consensus with
gaming PC's you're just selling one
thing with all these different
components and you're adding values so
it really does help you make a little
bit of side hustle a little bit of side
income which is exactly what I do and it
helps support the channel it helped
support me so my side hustle even when
the YouTube views it down which let's
face it they're pretty bad at the moment
this kind this kind of stuff really
helps me stay afloat and also I love
doing it as well but let's also take a
look at this here this is the next 79
up4 now I picked this up with the
intention of just solely flipping this
part because we got this for around one
hundred and sixty dollars we can easily
double up on this so putting this in a
build we may even lose money on it
because people just want i seven they
want six cores or even four core i7s it
doesn't matter but they're not going to
pay the premium that an enthusiast would
pay for an X 79 in a box with eight DIMM
slots very good vrm so this board is an
individual flip so essentially comes
back to the part of now how do I know
all these prices well from years of
doing this it just all gets stored in
the data bank here sort of like you know
this tez harddrive gets upgraded from a
one terabyte to a two terabyte I'd say
it's somewhere like around maybe a four
terabyte hard drive at the moment with
all these use price information stored
in here so you just got to know your
market know your deals I'm constantly
sort of in the market I've got friends
who are constantly on discord as well
I'll put the link in the description
below for that if you want to join us
we're constantly discussing new metas
new prices really good community but
also another big question is probably
how do I get to travel around well
you've probably seen me do a lot of
events recently and for me a lot of the
companies will want the me to bring all
my camera gear do a vlog and cover the
event which I'm more than happy to do
especially if they've got hot products
so in return they'll usually pay for my
flights and accommodation which I'm more
than happy to go check out what they've
got now I don't have any bias towards a
company I work I've done all this for
Nvidia Intel and AMD other companies
like Galax I
really enjoy just working with tech
companies in general and seeing what
they have or what value they have to
offer the consumer but of course the
biggest motivator that comes out of all
that is that of course I do requests on
those flights a few extra days so I can
stay around that country and do the use
price hunt and also have a little break
if time permits so that's how I keep a
business and leisure and mix them all in
one it's this crazy sort of formula and
I mean honestly I just love doing it
it's really exciting and I hope you guys
have been enjoying some of these
international parts hunts that have been
coming out but on top of that what about
the suitcase and getting through customs
that's probably another big question
I've got this massive suitcase it's
lightweight and it can like extend as
well it's got this extend option so yes
I pack that suitcase out with as many
parts as possible and a lot of the times
I'll just use the clothes on my back or
the clothes in my suitcase
wrap it around maybe even buy some new
threads in that location and just wrap
them around all the PC parts instead of
using bubble wrap so that way you're
getting protection for your PC parts but
you're also using your clothes to save
storage so I'm always value orientated
the way I do things is pretty crazy but
in the end it always works I've never
been pulled over by customs and have
them sort of examine what I've got
they've always been more interested in
my camera gear and my PC if I ever get
stopped over so it's they've never
really looked at the PC part so if they
do I'd just say yeah I bought some of
these PC parts used and I'm bringing
them back so anyway in closing these are
all the deals here on the table that I
picked up internationally you'll see
them either getting pieced out on the
channel or I might trade them with
friends etc so for instance even one PC
down here I've already put in there
that's the 7800 X that'll now complete
this build and that'll essentially add
value to that build over there
the 3930k one of them is being a
placeholder the other one over here is
actually going to go in that ud3 that
x79 that we salvaged on the channel
before and then we can whack some 16
gigabytes of vengeance
there and we've got ourselves one really
neat gaming PC because the ud3 itself
isn't really a desirable x79 motherboard
we're not losing really any value if we
were to put that in a build and
especially since we got this here for
like 80 not even cheaper I think I was
like around 70 US dollars it really just
brings value to the table when you're
doing these PC builds of course this PC
that we picked up here in Japan was an
absolute bargain from Dave when he did
that exchange with us out the front of
that heart off anyway I hope that
answers your questions in relation to
what I do with some of the deals that I
get how I travel and also in the end
it's really for me I just create value
any way I can and also big thanks to the
companies that do send me to these
events because the extra augmented
benefit of that is that I get to give
you guys the deals hunts and also I get
to go see a new place it's really
exciting I love doing this gig and when
events like Italy for example an AMD
come up I'm more than happy to go I
really do enjoy them that was actually
probably the funnest Tech event that
I've ever been to by a longshot it was
that good
the Ferrari sort of mix as well I've
been just the Ferrari fanboy since I was
a kid as well as Lamborghini fanboy
don't really pick sides there but
they're both just amazing supercars that
was just like a dream come true so to do
that use parts hunt and cover AMD's new
technology all in one was just super
exciting anyway guys hope you enjoyed
this video if you did then be sure to
hit that like button as well if you have
any questions or comments anything else
you want to know on top of the questions
answered in today's video then be sure
to drop a comment in the comment section
below also if you want to get the videos
right at the moment that they come out
then be sure to hit that Bell
notification to YouTube's telling me
that subs just at standard sub nowadays
doesn't really make a difference and if
you enjoyed the content you love the
used PC parts hunts you like what I do
around here building up the channel then
you can become a patron as well get
access to behind-the-scenes vlogs and
also behind the scenes live stream and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now
