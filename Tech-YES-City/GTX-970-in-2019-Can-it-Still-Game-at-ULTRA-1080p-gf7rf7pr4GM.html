released and it came in at a
hard-hitting price of 329 USD but it did
have some controversy where it came out
and there was only 3.5 gigabytes of RAM
instead of the advertised 4 and in fact
it did technically have 4 gigabytes of
RAM but 512 megabytes of that V Ram was
actually at a slower access speed than
the other 3.5 hence the term 3.5 out of
4 for the rating system anyway guys vram
issues aside today we are going to be
testing out the GTX 970 in 2019 and
seeing whether or not it can handle
games at 1080p and if it's still a good
buy if you're in the market for a
graphics card and you don't mind buying
a used GPU so with that aside let's get
into it
but as with any used graphics card that
comes through tackiest City we're gonna
be giving this thing some tech yes lovin
so there it is guys this thing now looks
like brand new and it's time to put it
on the test bench and test out seven
different titles plus a couple of
synthetics
so here we are guys the results are in
and the GTX 970 actually impressed me a
lot for a graphics card that's about
four and a half years old it actually
did phenomenally well at 1080p for
instance apex legends a game which is
very GPU dependent scored some very good
FPS figures on pretty much high settings
where we got 73 average FPS one percent
low of 51 and then a point one percent
low of 44 so the 3.5 gigabytes of vram
isn't really playing any hiccups at
1080p Ultra settings moving over to a
game like Rainbow six siege if you're
into some competitive multiplayer but
you still like your eye candy this game
got 146 average FPS 1080p ultra settings
and 102 minimum so it's actually a very
smooth graphics card while still getting
high FPS at 1080p now moving over to
battlefield 5 ultra here we saw settings
still going over 60 average FPS the 1%
and 0.1% lows dip a little bit lower but
that's because it is a pretty intense
game at 1080p Ultra settings however
removing the GPU memory restrictions
verse having it on we didn't really see
any difference in FPS whatsoever
however moving out of Far Cry 5 a pretty
intense title some people love this game
some people don't they don't think it's
pretty well optimized some people say
it's pretty good we're running the
in-house game benchmark anyhow and 1080p
ultra settings 72 average FPS 65 minimum
and then moving over to hitman two a
recently released title as well 91
average FPS 84 1% low point 1 percent
low of 83 so this game was running
absolutely fine on the GTX 970 at 1080p
ultra settings the movie the Resident
Evil 2 again we're getting over 60
average FPS we're getting quite high and
this is 1080p high settings now this
game does have a setting to I guess
utilized more vram than usual so I
thought it was interesting to try and
get over that 3.5 gigabytes of VRAM
usage however when I tried to do this
the interesting thing here was that the
game was actually kind of capping itself
to three point
well 3647 megabytes shall I say so it's
kind of like in the driver maybe Nvidia
is done something to hard limit this to
only utilize
the faster portion of VRAM and so when
we compare that to the slower 512
megabytes if we were to utilize that
maybe we would have some stuttering and
some slowdowns but since the driver
level I believe something's going on
here especially with resin evil 2 what
we're seeing here is no stuttering very
good one percent lower than 0.1 percent
lows even when we raise those settings
it just slows down the FPS the one
percent point one cent lows are still
absolutely fine and then for our last
title we had shadow of the Tomb Raider
1080p high settings we got over 60 FPS
here scoring 62 average FPS the minimums
were 49 so again it was a very smooth
experience guys the GTX 970 across those
seven games it was playing absolutely
fine with 1080p with pretty much all the
eye candy switched up in 2019 now
running some synthetics Like Heaven we
got a score of three thousand three
hundred seventy two points or one
hundred and thirty three average FPS
1080p high settings we were at a fire
strike we're getting well over 13,000
points on the graphics core and the
physics core of course using the 99
hundred K as our test system we got very
high in those scores as well so this
last part now besides the gaming I'm
actually looking at the gigabyte g1 the
GTX 970 here this card just impressed me
so much when we move over to the power
figures we've got 340 watts power
consumption with a 9900 K and this card
the whole time I did this performance
review here today it was overclocked
so the fact is that we're getting great
performance out of it it overclocked is
very easy but here's the kicker when
we're testing out the fan speeds 60% fan
speeds we got 68 degrees and this is in
summer so 26 degree ambient temperatures
it's very hot and we got 36 decibels so
this is pretty much better fan speed
noise then all the r-tx cards in the
Radeon seven thats come through here so
whatever they did back in 2014 in terms
of fan speed efficiency and noise is
working very well and I don't know
what's happened in the last few years
but it's great to see this with going to
a blast of the past even putting the
fans up to 80%
we saw a temperature drop to 62 degrees
and a decibel level of 47 decibel
so it was still bearable and then
putting the fan speeds up to 100% so 50
decibels but it was starting to get a
little bit noisy so usually in 2018 2019
up in recommending fan speeds of 60% for
pretty much every card here I don't know
whether to recommend 60% or 80% on the
gigabyte g1 so very weird but although
fan speeds did get up to 64% so I'd
recommend maybe locking in 60% if you
hate noise if you don't mind better
temps lock in 80% on this particular
card you guys that's about it for the
GTX 970 in 2019 it's still a phenomenal
card in terms of how it can perform at
1080p gaming and the best thing is you
can pick these up for a lot of the times
under a hundred US dollars if you're in
Australia they go as low as 150 Aussie
if you're into bargain hunting you can
pick them up even lower than that if
someone just wants to get rid of one for
instance this card here it was I came
with a PC that got traded in to me so I
virtually got this for nothing
so very good pick up after you give us
some tackiest loving it now looks like
brand new and it probably performs
better than it did with brand new
because we've put some better thermal
paste on it so temperatures are really
good performance is really good I am
actually really impressed with how the
GTX 970 performs in 2019 if you guys
liked this video then you know what to
do hit that like button also let us know
in the comments section below what you
think about the GTX 970 and also if you
want me to test out an older gravis card
let us know in the comment section below
what game what graphics card and I'll
make it happen for you guys and don't
forget to hit that sub button with a
notification bell turned on if you want
to see these videos as soon as they hit
YouTube if you want to get an inside
scoop before it even gets to YouTube and
check us out on Instagram Tech yes City
and I'll catch you in another check for
here very soon peace out for now bite
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
