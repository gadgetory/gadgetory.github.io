you may be feeling like this
oMG biscuit I'm going back to Windows 7
but before you do that maybe should
watch this guy
welcome to tech yes it is brain coming
back to you guys today with a Windows 8
or Windows 8.1 optimization guide now
the goal of this guide is to make your
OS as lightweight as possible so you
don't get any stuttering or any of that
crap going on when you're gaming so this
will be for gamers or for people who
just want to make that OS awesome make
it also feel like Windows 7 but even
better so without further ado I'll be in
the bottom right corner here guiding you
guys through and I want you guys to get
to programs and they're called pocky
start menu setup and VLC media player
there's also an alternative to Pocky
start menu setup so it's called classic
shell so I'll put the links in the
description below so if you don't like
Pocky you can get classic shell so what
we want to do is install Pocky by
double-clicking on it and then click
continue and basically essentially what
this will do is it'll install a start
menu on your desktop that will replace
your start menu button if you're on
Windows 8.1 if you're on Windows 8 it
will give you a start menu button so
this next little trick will be for
people on Windows 8.1 so all you have to
do is right-click on the home and
uncheck show windows logo button so
that's if you're on 8.1 if you're on 8
you don't need to do that so let's
right-click now that we've done that
right click on the Windows key go to
settings and then we want to uncheck
these two boxes show popular PC apps and
show web results in search also I like
to change the icon here by left clicking
on it and changing it to Windows and I
also like to disable or corner
navigation and then I like to click Save
and now once I've done that you'll see
here you've got an awesome-looking start
menu however I like to get rid of this
PC app store so I right-click on that
and I click remove favorite now once
we've got a Start menu back and we can
see here there's no more if we click on
Start menu there's no more going to the
Metro interface and so what we can do
here is we can type in advanced system
settings and then we can go to I like to
favorite this as well so if you want to
favorite something in Pocky you can just
left click on the star and it'll put it
in your favorites so I want you to go to
view advanced system settings left click
on that and now that we're in advanced
here we can go to performance left click
on settings
and then we can go to custom and this is
my personal favorite it makes it more
snappier as well as making a little bit
less of intense on your hardware
so I also left click I like to put
shadows onto my mouse pointer so once
we've unchecked those top seven boxes we
can and then we check shadow show
shadows on the mouse pointer we can
click a clot apply and then we can go to
advanced at the top here and make sure
this is this dots on programs adjust the
best performance for programs and with
virtual memory you don't need to touch
that though if you are a gamer and you
only play games and you're on an SSD and
you want to free up some SSD space then
you can take that off me nowadays I do a
lot of video rendering so I actually
need this on so I can click apply and
click OK and now the next trick we want
to go to is startup and recovery left
click on settings and we want to uncheck
time to display a list of operating
systems
and that'll just make startup a little
bit faster and then next thing we can do
is cliff click on system protection and
make sure this is turned off so we can
go to configure and disable system
protection and you can delete it as well
so we left click delete click close
disable system protection click apply
and that will free up some more space on
your SSD and then the next to next tip
we can do is go to remote and we can go
to advanced left click on advanced and
uncheck allow this computer be
controlled remotely so okay and then we
can uncheck allow remote assistant
connections to your to this computer
click o play click OK
and now we can click the Start menu
button again once we've done that and we
can go to add/remove programs and i like
to add this to my favorites as well you
can do that and then we left click on
that add remove programs and now once
we're here I can get rid of Pocky
download helper I don't need it but any
other programs you have here you can get
rid of them if you don't need them and
you don't use them then you can get rid
of them essentially this is mine here I
need all these programs so I'm not going
to get rid of them but after we've got
rid of the programs you don't need you
can go to turn Windows Features on or
off so left click on that and we can
just go to media features because I've
already installed VLC media player I can
just get rid of Windows Media Player and
I can use VLC in its place for my music
and my videos so now that that's done we
can then move on to the next step which
is left click the windows aim
in control panel another one that I like
to favor it and once we've opened up
control panel one other trick that I
like to go to is view by left click on
view by and change it to small icons and
that will bring back all your options
again so you can see everything here so
now that we're here we can go to left
click on power options and I like to
leave it on balance especially if you're
on a desktop computer or a laptop where
you need to where you want your computer
to essentially save power when it's not
in use so but one thing I do like to do
is go to change plan settings and I like
to change this put the computer to sleep
never and then I like to go to change
advanced power settings so left click on
that and then we go to left click on
hard disk turn off hard disk after and
this is my personal favorite as well I
like to type in never click apply and I
also like to go here to desktop
background settings left click on that
left click on slideshow and change it to
paused from available by left clicking
on it click a play ok now we can save
changes and we're ready for the next tip
so once you're back on the desktop
another trick that I like to do is click
on the taskbar right click on it go to
properties and then I like to never
combine these items so I click on this
tab never combined also like to go to
navigation and uncheck these top two
corner navigation buttons and then click
apply so essentially this will make your
desktop ism' it's a personal preference
if you don't want to do it you don't
have to
so next tip I like to do is right-click
on the desktop go to left click on
personalize and then down the bottom
left corner here we can go to ease of
access center I like to left click on
that and then left click on make it
easier to focus on tasks and I like to
check this box here prevent windows from
being automatically arranged when moved
to the edge of the screen so check that
click apply click OK and now we are
ready for the next step so we can
left-click on the Start menu button or
just hit it on your keyboard and type in
command and then right click that and go
open as administrator and now once we've
done this we can type in here
power is it power CFG /h and then type
off and what's what this will do is it
will turn off hibernation so if you need
hibernation you can leave that on but I
like to turn off hibernation and free up
some SSD space so once that's done you
should have a bit more SSD space and
another thing we can do is go to left
click on the file explorer tab here down
on your taskbar and go to view and make
sure file name extensions is checked and
so that'll bring up some file name
extensions you can see here my disk
space I've actually freed up about 10
gigabytes but just doing these tricks so
now once that's done we've got these
files here as you can see I can see the
extensions on them and so what you want
to do is make sure that they open up
with Windows Photo Viewer
instead of going to that Windows app
program which is photos so you can go
here lefty right click on your photo or
if it's a movie you can play that with
VLC you can right click on this and go
open with choose default program and you
can do Windows Photo Viewer keep using
Windows Photo Viewer and that will just
open up my photos with Windows Photo
Viewer so now the next step is to turn
off automatic updating on programs that
use automatic updating so if you can see
here you can click on an open up Skype
by right-clicking on the bottom right
corner here and go right click on Skype
and go to open Skype and once we've
opened Skype we can click on tools here
and options and essentially we can just
go to privacy here and uncheck accept
Skype browser cookies and allow
Microsoft targeted apps we can also
clear the Skype cookies out and then we
can go down to advanced and uncheck all
these boxes here and then we can go down
to automatic updates turn off automatic
updates and click Save and that should
make Skype a little bit more lightweight
and not as invasive next step we can
right click on the desktop I sorry not
right click on the desktop we can go
down the bottom right corner here right
click and on the Nvidia icon and open
nvidia geforce experience this is if
you're on an nvidia graphics card and
another thing here we can go down to
left click on update
it's automatically check for updates
take it off and we can uncheck all these
as well and then we're good to go so we
can save so I like to manually check for
updates anyway now let's move on to the
last step of the guide okay so for this
next part we are on the desktop we can
just press control alt delete and then
we can left-click on task manager and
now once we're here we'll see a heap of
processes here and it's got background
processes and also got apps so one thing
that we want to look for here is to make
sure that we are not well something here
is not using the CPU or that lot or a
lot so if we're left click on the CPU
tab this arrow here it'll actually show
us what programs are using the most
amount of the CPU and you'll see here
I'm actually recording at the moment for
you guys with desktop software so this
will be using 20% roughly but besides
that we can see that really not not a
lot of programs are using the CPU the
max is maybe yeah 3% from desktop window
manager and that's this program itself
using resources so besides these two
programs I really don't have a lot of
CPU usage going on here so that's
actually a really good thing see here
pokey that only uses up 0.1% so it's
really nothing so if we left click on
performance here the performance tab we
can right click on change graph - and
you want to make sure it's selected at
logical processes so this will bring up
a graph for every processor or every
thread on your CPU and now with this you
just want to look at it and make sure
nothing's spiking here as well so that's
one thing that you want to look for make
sure nothing is spiking and you want to
make sure that it's pretty flat if I
wasn't using Camtasia at the moment to
record the desktop it would be
relatively like down the bottom here all
the lines would be relatively flat as
you can see here even with the desktop
recording software going it's still
smooth like it's still at a stable level
so once we've done that we click on
memory as well we can check memory and
make sure memory is not doing the same
as well so if you are getting big spikes
here you can then go to process
and you can watch this and you can see
which program is momentarily coming up
and then you can right-click on that
program and task or open file location'
and then you can delete it and get rid
of it and apps and just kill it for good
so basically the whole thing of this the
point of this guide is to make sure that
nothing is really spiking too high as if
you're getting that in games that will
cause stuttering so this is just
something that I personally like to do
if I'm getting stuttering in games and
I'll check and make sure and make and
find out what program it is you can also
click on start up here and find out what
if you're loading up a lot of crap that
you don't need you can just right click
it and click disable and that should
disable that program from booting up at
start so I have for me personally I use
all these programs so I actually need
them on startup so that's it guys in
conclusion I will say that this new OS
is pretty much now like Windows 7 but in
my opinion only better and I think
Windows 8 has the slight advantage or
8.1 has the slight advantage over
Windows 10 and Windows 7 but keep in
mind that Windows 10 is still only in
beta
I do believe that'll get better as time
goes on but as it stands Windows 8 is
currently the best OS to be on in my
opinion if you're a gamer and with these
tweaks that I've applied today I think
it's awesome now like you've got no
stuttering and you've got a OS that
looks amazing and functions really well
so anyways I hope you enjoyed this if
you did please give it a thumbs up if
you have any comments or questions about
this guide then please leave a comment

catch you guys we're going to take video
