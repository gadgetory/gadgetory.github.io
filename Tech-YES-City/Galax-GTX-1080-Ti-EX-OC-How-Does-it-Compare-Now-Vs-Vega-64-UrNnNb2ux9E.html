however this time from Galax it's their
e^x OC sniper in the widest setting now
they sent this over for two reasons the
first being that they want me to go to
their event next month in November which
will be hosted in Bangkok which will be
on the 25th and we'll have some extreme
overclocking featuring ln2 so that's
gonna be crazy I can't wait to cover
that event for you guys so with today's
video we're kind of gonna peel two
potatoes with one peel off anyway hey
guys you get and for the overclocks on
the ten atti we managed to get to point
zero four new yards on the core and also
for the memory eleven point eight
gigahertz effective and now this is
going up against the gtx 1080 Strix
which is one of the most popular 1080
Strix is out there we overclock this to
two point zero six on the core and also
for the memory that got around a
gigahertz and boost effective and then
we've got the Vegas 64 my friend Shannon
I call him sham for the fan he borrowed
me his Vegas 64 card managed to
overclock this to sixteen hundred and
thirty-seven megahertz on the core and
also for the HBM memory we got this 210
10 megahertz effective and we set the
fan speeds on all three cards to 80% so
with that said let's get on with an
overclocking showdown
so we could seen those benchmarks that
na TTA is performing where it should be
it's roughly 30 to 35 percent faster in
a lot of the titles now this is all
overclocked as well the Vegas 64
actually gained quite a considerable
boost when I overclocked it however with
that the power drawer does go up
considerably but I believe if you're an
enthusiast and you're getting a Vegas 64
card and you want to go with the AMD
lineup you're probably going to want to
get the best performance possible so the
Vegas 64 card I was pleased with the
performance updates that AMD have
released with their latest 17.1 a driver
especially compared to the initial
release of the drive they released in
August the Galaxy GT X 1080 of course is
performing quite well when we look at
the PCB it's using the Nvidia reference
design which on the 1080 Ti is really
good to begin with is probably the most
power efficient design out there for
1080 T eyes and with that you saw of
course performance that's not going to
match something like an Oris GT X 1080
extreme edition however it does perform
quite close that 3dmark slice tracks
score nearing 30 1000 points is very
respectable and the fan speeds were
actually not even noisy at all I'll let
you guys take a quick listen to both 80%
and stock profiles of course running
through some more numbers with
temperatures and power draw all these
three cars performed really well with 80
percent fan speeds of course the
reference Vega 64 model does get really
loud at 80 percent fan speeds however it
was good to see that this card was
keeping all this temperature under wraps
so I really like this reference design
from AMD even though it's actually quite
loud I'm sure once the aftermarket
models come in they will do a much
better job at keeping the noise down but
also keeping the temperatures quite low
though further glancing over the EXO c10
atti it's got two 90 millimeter fans RGB
lighting on both the fans and the side
plating you've got an aluminium
backplate and also the fans will stop
when it's fighting and the temperatures
are quite low looking at the rear input
and output you've got one HDMI out and
also three display ports out there with
a single player benchmarks I do two
individual runs and also run the can
benchmarks Deus Ex was giving the
victory to AMD with the 1018 versus the
Vegas 64 and also games like Far Cry
primal were scoring a victory for the
GTA
ten eighty though the ten atti it was a
notch above both these gravis cards so
we can see that that was pulling
comfortably ahead
so yeah this time around the benchmarks
were a little bit boring everything was
kind of as expected though it was my
first time playing quake champions and I
was just so bad at this game it's really
fast-paced it actually looks really nice
too so really good for those twitch
shooters people who play cod and stuff
like that are really going to enjoy
quake champions when the final version
is released though I'll probably have to
go get some tips from rocketjump ninja
as he's really good at this game and I'm
just yeah I'm really bad at it I did
however like this gun that kind of shot
out three shots at a time and the rocket
launcher was pretty cool too but I had
this guy like running around with a sore
and it was just like yeah he was fast he
was chopping me up a lot of the time so
yeah that was that but also with the
multiplayer benchmarks I do run them for
quite a long time to try and weed out
variances as multiplayer benchmarks are
always going to inherently be
inconsistent just due to the nature of
them though if you guys do enjoy
benchmarks then I'll refer you over to
Steve from hardware unboxed and he can
test like 30-plus games in one go I
don't know how he does it it's
absolutely insane if I tested that many
games personally I think I'd just go
crazy it's so much data on a spreadsheet
I don't know how he does it but I'll put
the link in the description below for
his channel if you like benchmarks so in
conclusion with the GT x 1080 EXO see
from Galax what you're getting is a
really nice card it performs really well
even out of the box the thermals are
really good and also the noise is really
low too but also the widest thetic
that's definitely something that makes
this card stand out from the rest and
also if you want to put it in a white
theme build it's going to look really
nice I put it in the air 7:40 in the
background here it's looking really
schmick with a white and black theme
build so it does go in really nicely and
of course you're not going to be at any
detriment with this 1080 TI versus other
1080 TI's of course some of the more
expensive ones will perform a little bit
better but there might be a huge gap
between this and the others even if we
compare to the Hall of Fame for example
but this one will use less power for the
performance you're getting and of course
taking a quick peruse over the other two
cards the 1080 Strix that performs
really well really nice card and the
Vegas 64 I can't wait to get an
aftermarket
lucien with a really good cooler to see
how much lower the noise will be and see
if we can get some better performance
though the vegas 64 card the stock
cooler does do a good job of cooling
it's just the noise is pretty high and
with that we did get some pretty good
overclocks
so this is a great option for someone
who's looking for an Nvidia alternative
and also wants to get free sync support
as free sync of course it is practically
free vs g sync which does add that
module does add cost to the monitor
although what about pricing with the exo
c-- card this is where things get a
little bit weird in australia its price
actually pretty well you can currently
get it for around a thousand and 30 AUD
of static ice or if you're on eBay
that's currently a sale with 10% off you
get it for around thousand AUD delivered
to your door so in Australia you're
pretty much covered galux do offer good
value for money though if you're in
America or the UK I couldn't find this
card for sale anywhere and so this is
sort of a critique of Galax I'd like to
see them get their stock especially out
on amazon.com I think in America it
accounts for like over half the sales of
online goods so you guys may want to get
on that and start getting stuck out
because you guys do make good graphics
cards and I'm sure people would want to
pick one up and try one out if they were
doing like a white theme to build anyway
guys if you enjoyed today's video then
be sure to hit that like button and let
me know in the comment section below
have you tried a galaxy card or do you
currently own a guys card and if so what
did you think of it also if you haven't
got a guy's card would you like to buy
one if so why if not why not
and I know that's a lot of questions but
I love reading your thoughts and
opinions as always and make sure if you
haven't already hit the subscribe button
with notifications turned on because you
are not gonna not want to drink what the
yes-man is brewing for you and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
