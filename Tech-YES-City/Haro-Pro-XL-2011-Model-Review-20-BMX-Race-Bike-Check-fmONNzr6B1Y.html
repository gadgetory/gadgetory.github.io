basically look at my Jairo bike Pro
Excel 2011 so this is their Pro Excel
model and basically I got this bike is a
good is that a good price point I mean I
got Sam in Japan so it's hard for me to
find any BMX bikes at all but yeah I
wanted to get something to do some
exercise on and this is what I got so
basically it looks a lot better in real
life than it did on the internet like
this model looked a bit crap on the
internet from the pictures but I really
like the look of it in real life eh
especially the grips grips of wicked so
the obviously the shop they assembled it
for me so that saved me a lot of time
just they assembled it and then posted
it out
so really saves time if we take a look
at the actual bike up a bit closer yeah
that's the obviously it's got you know
since a lot of sins parts and their
nation rims good tyres you know
everything silence feels solid so this
bike feels really solid so if you want
to look at the part specifically just
you can go on the high res website and
have a look
yeah it's I've took it taken it for a
spin it rides really well so yeah it's a
really nice bike at a really nice price
so it's got um you know sealed ball
bearings which is really good they're
gonna last a lot longer than on sealed
yeah just this it's one that's
sick bike and I like it so basically
yeah just and then like you know look at
the front like just give that a spin get
up say just spin the tire and yeah you
just say like this is you know you're
buying quality when the wheel just keeps
spinning just a good bike and then see
yeah I got this for about 400 us it was
about some on gelsen that was free
postage and I was already assembled so
it's a 21 inch top tube on it
and yeah they've taking it for a spin I
really like it it's really King so yeah
you can just see the thing just keep
spinning so good quality components on
this bow if you got any questions just
leave them in the comments below this is
the 2011 model 2 so it's not the 2012 I
got this because it was like 130 dollars
cheaper than the 2012 model and yeah so
if you've got any questions yeah just
leave in the comments below and of
course subscribe get Brian easygoing so
yeah that's it that's the bike in the
flesh so if you if you're thinking about
getting one then I highly recommend it
so I'm about 70 kill I'm about 70 kilos
and we'll 72 to be exact and the black
is pretty damn strong it holds up well
I'm about five foot ten so one hundred
and seventy eight centimeters so that's
a really nice fit for me so yeah guys
there it is hard Pro excel so yeah the
reason I've I haven't been in BMX for
ages when I gotta quit when I was like
15 I quit I think I sold my bike to a
friend and then yeah I've looked back
but now just recently I want to exercise
again so it's been a while and I know
horror around when all the kids that
stood the test of time definitely know
and definitely it's a good bike so I
recommend it especially for the price
see you guys if you find yourself
looking for a if you find yourself
looking for a pro excel model and be
sure to if you come past this model be
sure to get it if you're looking for a
good value alright guys peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
