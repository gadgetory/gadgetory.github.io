and gentlemen right now so welcome back
to tech world TV and I'm joined by the
one the only
Salizar of the Greg how you doing man
what's going on man
wait this intestine I never thought you
would actually say it in real life so
this is very very satisfying moment okay
well we cuz we start we haven't strained
for a while we both went to call me text
that was insane it was so busy I was
just on point that whole time and you I
believe you went to Germany after yeah
yeah there for about three days
he's my wife lives in Germany and then
we both flew I flew back home earlier
than she did she came in last night so
it's been the time zones have really
done a number on us getting used to the
taiwan time so much like what 13 hours
ahead of here and then going back seven
hours to germany and then back another
seven hours to CST it's this pull man
it's not i thought yeah yeah this plan
okay we thank you for your hard work
greg and we have a hot show lined up for
you guys today some music coming in that
I found off reddit and then sort of dug
in more the Lisa sue is apparently
Jenson Wang's a nice so we'll roll the
intro and then we'll get straight into
this topic so see you guys soon okay
century have you seen the intro I have
seen this one where the world blows up
yeah pretty it's pretty hot I'm watching
it too late though so eventually we're
like in the live streams okay well we're
gonna get straight onto the new segment
here here it originated from like an
article where I okay a little blonde
alive that's not gonna happen again
again it said basically with xsplit you
have to have the browser open on edge
for some reason his chrome doesn't work
probably but anyway Nvidia CEO Jenson
Wang is the uncle of AMD CEOs Lisa so
this was on reddit and then it came up
on Wikipedia and apparently it's like
confirmed like it's not BS it's real
like this is real news and then like
where it came from was babble tech
reviews made a video and like six
minutes and 42 seconds in and you see
like they start talking about it on a
Chinese news site on news like show and
yeah they like related and I've been
telling people for ages I've been
telling people for ages about all these
you know you get these guys like that
just diehard fan boys of these companies
and it's like at the top of these
companies they're all friends and now
family like is it I'm still kind of like
set up back by this because I don't know
I have to do my own research to confirm
it you saw the reddit post jaja is just
chilling here Joe jars chilling he's
just like doesn't phase in man Joe Joe
we've been telling the audience for a
long time guys just focus on the
products if you have products a good buy
them yourself to me this doesn't change
anything about I mean how I see both
companies whatever they're both
companies that want to both make money
at the end of the day their bottom
dollar is all that matters to them so if
they're related or not to me if they're
related it's actually kind of cool
because then there's more of like a
family rivalry there and then they feel
even more convicted to compete right so
I'm fine with it if that is the case I
don't think it's a bad thing it's just
it's kind of funny it reminds me of the
was the Mayweather fight when they were
all buddy-buddy after the boxing match
right they
just at each other's throats beforehand
like they all like you said yeah they
all know each other they've all been to
dinners together you know it's not like
they hate each other the the fan bases
make it seem as though that's the case
but I'm sure they all get along just
fine
so well I just thought that was like a
ziz interesting because I've been sad
for years and years now but maybe people
will start getting on the tech yes chin
maybe just like gay guys just focus on
the products so not much else to that
news story really I mean I've gone down
conspiracy Avenue before this sort of
plays into today's can spear is we
starting off the new segment with
conspiracy theory do you think that
Jensen recommended Lisa sue for the
position and this impossible
infiltration that do you reckon it's a
possibility it could be oh no it's a
conspiracy theory we're going to go to
explore this so I've said in the past I
mean they're all companies guys are all
publicly listed companies they all make
products that people buy so yeah they're
not like doing a charity service so
whatever you guys at the end of the day
think about AMD and video Intel just
keep in mind that they're there to make
a profit that's all so close that off
and then we want to move on to something
that's really juicy to do we won't move
on the next news segment this is pretty
juicy because this one really like when
I read about this over six months ago I
thought it wasn't possible now it is
cryptocurrency and I know some people
are gonna sort of tune out with
cryptocurrency but this was crazy
because it's basically 51% attack and
what happens is especially proof-of-work
networks my favorite ones n cash just
suffered an attack well not just I mean
also at Computex so I didn't really tune
into this news but essentially they'll
hire because they can attackers can now
hire Network like from nice hash and
stuff they can hire computing power and
so they can momentarily hire the network
with enough compute power that they can
then do what's called a duplicate
transaction because they have the mining
network themselves they can send that
cryptocurrency to a exchange change it
into Bitcoin
get it off the exchange and at the same
time they've sent another transaction to
another wallet and what they do since
they've got a 51% of the network hashing
rate they then say not that transaction
was invalid the one we sent to the
exchange and essentially it's a big
ripoff and con job and this has happened
with xancash it's happened with the
numerous other crypto currencies now and
it's sent the value I guess it's shaken
up the crypto currency market big time
because this is on regulated guys
unregulated so it's completely
unregulated when that happens you are
you're essentially you give danger to
these kinds of things like have you you
haven't really delved into the world of
crypto currency have you no I haven't
touched it because of that very thing
because it isn't regulated I think it's
just and manipulated cesspool exactly
apparently they stole a $700,000 worth
of crypto currency of Zen cash as this
one really hurt me at heart because I
was big a big fan of Zen cash it really
sort of really hit home with me because
this was the crypto currency also I mean
I stopped mining in January I pretty
much gave up in January I'm just gonna
do you do usually like when when you
make your money doing that did you just
start reinvesting it into other coins
and just trying to build no I know I put
it all back into the channel dude like
that's the man I made some money off
crypto and I said to my viewers how much
I made back you know the video I
remember that yeah yeah I mean I told my
viewers I was completely transparent and
that money went into this tech your city
so I haven't looked back yet I just knew
it was a stupid price point for crypto
currency and yeah I just got out but now
I'm sort of sitting on the sidelines and
I'm seeing what's unfolding this price
crashes I look at Zen cash it's down
near to it it's almost getting down to
its new low getting close and this sort
of really shocked the market because now
these 51% attacks are real they'll
Fuhrer I think they'll like talking
about it like over six months ago
they're talking about it could be a
possibility but now it's actually
happening and people are scamming the
system and because again because it's
unregulated it's a big problem
that's just like it's just it's really
sort of like wow okay I mean sure
Bitcoin would be almost impossible to
hack
because of just how much bra compute
power there is there but it's a really
scary thing and so I mean oh I don't
know I've always been on the fence with
cryptocurrency I've always been on both
sides and seeing the arguments on both
sides that this one really sort of made
me step back and open my eyes I'm like
wow okay what is really going on here
with crypto so what really are what set
me off was the the fact that we started
hearing talks about the US government
wanting to tax it right so that was the
first thing on their mind was like okay
let's just get money from the money
they're making that's not worry about
regulating it because we know they're
making so much money from the
manipulation we're just gonna tax it so
that we can reap the benefits of the
manipulation itself and to me like
there's a double standard there is you
know trying to invent or reallocate some
resources from like the SEC or the FTC
which are the those are the
bureaucracies we have in the states that
regulate trade and stuff you know trying
to just get those up from scratch to
regulate a market that was invented or
you know that wasn't invented that
that's been growing and popularly
massively over the past year is just I
guess too difficult for them so what
they've got here essentially is a chart
and they put it up where you can
actually borrow hashing power from nice
hash and the ones with over a hundred
percent is basically you can just borrow
the power from that nice hash cost you
eight hundred nineteen dollars to
theoretically hack a 1.12 billion market
cap network that is scary like that's
really scary same with Bitcoin gold
that's apparently doable as well it's
really I open it I opening when you look
at those figures so it's sort of like a
new thing that's coming into play I mean
maybe this will be a driving force for
dropping the price of crypto again and I
mean that's what I mean there's good
news to come out of this gamers as I
said I will actually I filmed it used
parts on this month it was huge stay
tuned for that I would probably be
dropping on the channel tomorrow but in
that video I talked about the the the
trends so I'm picking up all the parts
essentially to build gaming PC's but the
GPUs because I know the GPUs are going
to come down this is like you know this
is proof of work
right here on the news so just get ready
if you're a gamer and you want to cheap
grabs card a perfect storm is coming
about and you'll be getting your
graphics cards cheap don't worry where
my graphics card you know it give me an
Aussie accent actually Crocodile River
where's Rock River that's where my
graphics cards because Australia where's
my graphics card so yeah the prices are
plummeting of cryptocurrencies and but
on some other news as well we came out
of Computex with the the 28 core and I
watch game is Nexus video very very here
was the first to sort of break this news
and it was a very good video and what do
you think like what's the whole thinking
about this whole 28 core display it
can't be - I didn't actually even see it
I was so busy I didn't even see I didn't
have time but I mean what do they do
like really what are they doing like
this is what I just tell myself what is
this who thought of marketing this with
massive tubes from chilled water going
into a PC and think that people wouldn't
notice not too much yes the practicality
of it
I give them the benefit of the doubt
from the aspect or from the perspective
that when I first saw this stuff you
know I asked you like okay it's really
easy to sell rants on YouTube especially
and at first I looked at at Steve's
video I was like oh come on you know
this is just like if you grab it but
then I actually thought about it like
okay what did what is Intel actually
doing here what is their purpose behind
this display because if they're just
showing hey check out this really cool
build we got this system overclocked
across 28 chorused of what five-year
Hertz or whatever you know this is
really cool but if they're if they're
trying to promote it in a way that is
deceiving is misleading as in hey the
average consumer can pick up you know
any CP just like this and overclock it
to four and a half five gigahertz that's
where the that's where the the
misconception comes in that's where the
misleading and the the kind of under the
table stuff shady things come into play
so I think that it was it ultimately
came down to how until presented it I
didn't see the actual booth I didn't
watch Steve's video I just it came out
as airing context I never watched it
grew too busy basically I've never seen
a vrm this beefed up but I did see that
picture
I mean the thing is the thing that gets
me is the practicality if they just said
look we've got a beefy water cooling
system even if it was a custom hard line
tubed water cooling I would have been
like okay who cares the fact they had to
use like chilled water you know and then
covering up the pipes and taping
everything down and for condensation
it's right right it's not practical at
all like where's the practicalities
apparently is like using a thousand
watts for the chiller alone like a bull
so I didn't even know like that it was
just what happened with the marketing
now there is devil's advocate a little
bit like it's like half devil's advocate
and not even not even it's not that I
guess you would even call that Computex
well that one thing that came out of
Computex for me was I realized it wasn't
really like a lot of the companies in
the enthusiast tech scene have made it
for showcasing new products that's
certainly a big thing that's come out of
context but when I was walking around
the floor and I should have logged it I
just didn't have any time I was talking
a lot of the booths
one of the coolest booths there was
summer I've done a case I've featured
that case on my channel ages ago and I
was doing like refresh and x58 systems
and stuff very budget orientated now I
talked to them about their cases and
they were straight away they pitched me
we sell 500 units three RGB fan ring
fans at the front 40 USD a pop and I was
like well it's actually really good
value but they were selling wholesale so
a big thing of Computex was the
wholesale factor a lot of people are
going around they're from businesses
worldwide and looking to get new
wholesalers and contacts and stuff like
that that was a big thing about Computex
that I didn't understand from me but
from last year I was just a newb this
year are sort of like sourcing out what
was going on so maybe a lot of wholesale
contacts for Intel were there and
they're trying to impress them but
little they've realized this you know if
you're dropping this kind of money on a
28 course system you're gonna be
researching that thing
Kingdom Come so I mean yeah I didn't
even know that's what I said I don't
even know where the little devil at see
it's playing but I guess they're trying
to showcase their product being the best
it can be but even then it was just it
was a fail it was a real big fail
I think the motherboard was the biggest
part of that I mean and you showed me
that and that instantly brought back the
reminder of how ridiculous
just the power delivery aspects of that
board like the vrm up top that's just
insane you're never gonna see them a
consumer very bored and if you if you do
it's gonna be so unsustainable from a
thermal standpoint that you know the
Lehman's never gonna have any cooling
capacity capable of keeping that CPU
from thermal throttling immediately when
you push the power button like that's
just insane like look at that it's just
there's no way that's ever gonna be
mainstream ever so when you use a board
like that to convey this you know insane
amount of power the regardless of it the
chip is overclockable to five without or
with Ellen to you know if they set up
front that they were cooling with Ellen
to that's one thing if they're using a
chill or whatever but if they don't say
that and instead they're saying hey
check out the CPU
it's overclocked to five gigahertz check
out how cool it is that's that's where I
think it's shady and and because I
didn't see the booth personally I don't
know enough about it yet I need to watch
this video to be frank because
apparently you know it was preposterous
so I'll be able to talk more about it
when I see the video yeah I mean just
from the motherboard looking at the
motherboard itself I already know that
it was just a publicity stunt you know
well apparently if you want to buy it
it's coming out in September so I mean
is it well there's some Zeon's here like
this is the wine 28 core eight one is
twenty eight cores might not be the
exact one that it's going for like
fifteen thousand on eBay yeah there's
another one twenty one thousand dollars
oh man you really got to want those
cause if you want this I mean anyway on
the flip side
AMD do have their thirty-two core second
gen rows in Red River they announced
that and they had that on demo and it
was running absolutely fine it was on it
a big air cooler now that was the
practicality that was just real and that
was good now one thing I did arm I made
a video for gigabyte and I told gigabyte
I was like ok guys hey what's the deal
with all this cuz I didn't have time to
check it out yet and they told me 24
core now people pulled me on my video
they're like Brian not 24 quarts 32 but
that's what I was told by gigabyte now
sometimes they let information slip so
I'm not sure if that's an indicator of
whether X 399 will only be getting the
24 core as opposed to the 32 core
who knows hmm yeah so they had a 16 Corp
now they got a 24 Court seems logical
you if you're gonna throw the 32 court
gauntlet down what are you gonna have
for the next generation you know I mean
at least they have now we got a plan for
2020 or whatever least that gives them
an option it does make a bit of sense
and that's what I was told I was told
the X 399 will support the new 24 core
specifically 24 core not 32 core so that
relayed that in my video because I
hadn't even heard about the 32 core
presentation at that point in time was
also busy so that's what I relate to my
viewers who knows that's that's maybe
maybe you're just getting a 24 call but
the thing is right
I had a 70 900 X in my main I had an
1800 X before that I now have the 8700
km I'm angry it's the most practical for
what I do and that's video editing I do
a bit of power using man I'm no slouch I
do a lot of work on my computer 5
gigahertz 87 okay is beast its beast
mode ring boss snappy as I did that
video and it showed that there was not
things weren't in my head at least from
the statistics so whatever
yeah no I get to I have I have a 2,700 X
in this system I'm streaming with I have
a 8700 K in the system right next to it
I switch between them all the time I
edit personally I edit and render with a
to 700 K I've been playing around with
the hardware and coding the IGP encoding
and just kind of trying to see if there
are real sustainable benefits with that
because there with every update with
Adobe it always messes something up
inevitably so I keep having to retest
every time they do that play with
different settings and they actually go
in and physically enable IGP in some
cases and I for all intents and purposes
for what I do without I GP the 2700 X's
are really good all around CPU
especially for the price the a 727s is
good but yeah it really is
yeah I liked it so sorry I liked it so
much more than the 1800 X and people
asked an increment bit and here's why
because this is for me this is a biggest
selling point for it you can enable XMP
profile with the 2,700 X and just let it
go you can run it like
I haven't had a single issue with any
Ram kid I've ever run on on any 2nd
generation processor just because
they've refined like they've refined
that section of the CP so much more from
an architectural standpoint that's a big
jump for me is the fact that you're no
longer limited by memory speed on the
Infinity fabric side of things for the
CPU and now you get those that that was
one of the big things that I was talking
about in my review video is like look
the gains you're gonna see from this are
more than likely going to be from the
jump in memory speeds assuming you have
memory that is able to clock higher than
the 2400 or 2666 megahertz frequency you
were running it at before on Rison once
that was as high as I could usually ever
get my 1700 X or whatever else I was
testing and that was a big factor a big
limiting factor right with the Infinity
fabric was that memory frequency so big
improvement there and I think that
closed and they got a lot further for me
you'd like 2700 X felt snappy Oh than
the 1800 X by up by quite a bit you know
and like I'm going down this tangent now
we've got a used build coming I'm gonna
call it the snap master flex it's yeah
it's gonna be such a cool build
I may even switch my main rig to it it's
that cool so stay tuned for that things
aren't yeah but hey when people you know
in the past people said it's all in my
head it ain't in my headband it's a
difference
it's was what's the word quantifiable
and you can show it and I did shot now
you know I get some guys you know just
guy doesn't know what he's talking about
right I make mistakes man sure I've made
me to stay sometimes I've made pretty
bad mistakes in the past on my channel
doesn't stop me from you know I mean the
clumsy factor that's never gonna go away
always gonna be a clumsy dude that's
just the nature of me I mean look at dad
man if you've seen him on the channel
before he's clumsy like he's the next
level clumsy compared to me
but it's not gonna stop me some still
endeavoring into new topics and sort of
trying to get things right and been the
jack-of-all-trades that's not gonna stop
me from doing that especially if I can
open up a can of worms on this and
people get more insight more knowledge
out of it then isn't that what the tech
community is all about growing your
knowledge mmm
anyway snap master flex build coming I
like the 2700 X a lot more than 1700 I
mean yeah I know you did a video $200
for the r7
seven eight hundred but dude knowing
what I know I wouldn't go with a 78 I'd
still want to get that 2700 X or 2700 we
have you're paying 130 bucks more for
doesn't like that not a man you can get
that's a different wind at 10 16 at ten
seventy to me that's a bigger difference
in timing from 1700 or 2700
because I'm editing videos I do for me
there's no difference you have on a
five-minute 4k video file that's maybe
20 seconds like I'll give 20 seconds any
day every day for the difference in a 10
16 to 1070 to me that's that's a much
bigger Delta than 20 seconds in
rendering no but you'll see now you're
overlooking the subjective things to
like okay so you go from an SSD to a
hard drive rive you ever done that
before oh god it's terrible now it's not
on that scale of course it's not or not
I'm just setting the scenario calm down
just setting them just imagine and just
picture it now you go from a 2700 X to a
1700 you stir it you just know
something's a little bit off there you
look so now do you picture me in my
mindset I can't go back to a 7 800 hold
on hold on hold on oh the carry the same
story the same analogy going from a 2700
X to a 1700 X right you notice a
difference there I did notice a
difference going from one to the other
you notice a bigger difference going
from the going from the Jesus the 1070
to the 1060 yeah yeah so if that that's
the price difference there it's a
hundred hundred $20 Delta that's the
difference we - 1062 1070 right so do
you notice a bigger difference going
from a 1070 to 1060 or from a 2700 X to
a 1700 X but you're assuming and I play
video games
I'm assuming that you reallocate that
extra money into something worthwhile
usually that's a graphics card alright
that's your assumption so I mean food
for gaming sure your arguments very what
I'm talking about video editing on which
I do you I mean nobody just video edits
on video editing P I mean they use it
for gaming if you don't sue me unless
it's just like Oh
workstation PC for virtual machines and
encoding and all that other stuff but
here's the scary place Gary but I'm
literally like ninety five five I spend
95% of my time on the computer video
editing I don't I don't gain much
nowadays that's the sad thing I look at
all this gear I've got a year and it's
just depressing because I like I get I
got you know I just know it's not the
president I mean I love doing the
content but ya know if anybody's not fun
like videoing that is not fun compared
to everything else to do around here
it's just it's just a drag but hey you
know a lot of people have editors on the
site like they'll pay I don't know
anyway to be like 40 and a hundred bucks
per video for something for them to
video in it yeah I mean I look behind
the scenes I talked about this exact
thing just like today yesterday and then
I uploaded it today they just taught
about these exact same thing so with the
video editors maybe the states is
different I'd love to find like you know
anyway it's it's there it's there so
what do we got on other news as well
sorry we've been sort of going off on
the tangents XIII 90 is apparently a
refresh of a XIII 70 so you might see a
little bit of a beefed up vrm there bit
more marketing terminology apparently
the old meant to use a 14 nanometer know
that using 22 nanometer on on the chips
that I believe and which is that yeah
and so they were meant to add a new
features with that too like native USB
3.1 gen2 support per family that's not
coming at all
so you're just getting a refreshed zi
370 but the good news out of that is
that if you have a good zi 370 multiple
you can then use that same z 370
motherboard to get the eight core so if
you were if you were if your parents
coming in September as well so if your
heart was said if you're like look Brian
I want the eighty nine hundred K I mean
that who knows the name probe will be
the eighty nine hundred K I want that I
have to have it then maybe look for a Z
370 a beefed-up
Z 370 on sale because III three three
nine he's gonna cost more than the Z 370
all things considered just pointing that
out there but yeah that's that's the
rooms in the eight core here we've got
the news segment which this website has
so conveniently
a little bit of a free zone you know 70
was that was the C 370 was like that
premature launch right for Intel to keep
up with AMD's launch a Verizon which was
just taking hold everywhere I mean
that's why we only had 370 for a long
time right so that was the only chipset
you can buy for coffee Lake for the
longest time because it was essentially
a rush to launch right to get those CPUs
to market and z3 90 is essentially what
Z to be 70 should have been so it is a
refresh in a way but it's also it's
supposed to be a pretty substantial
improvement in power delivery standpoint
to be able to handle up to eight cores
which is something that we've from Intel
you know back in the past we've had to
use the X extreme series chipsets
enthusiast chipsets for those kinds of
power delivery there's good hot over
there yeah it was talking about the
eighty nine hundred K so yeah apparently
that's coming in September there was at
one that was released the diagram is
gone because we got the old snap error
and we're on live stream so we don't
risk anything sort of crashing again and
so yet coming in September basically
eight core 16 threads is a engineering
sample out at the moment 2.6 key goes
boost clock on knowing again that's
really all there is to look forward to
with that nothing nothing really super
exciting except you get another two
cores four threads of that snappy
goodness that's it's about it yeah Greg
you there yeah do you want more
beautiful commentary no we can talk
about this one here until CEO resigned
due to a bad reload no not bad
relationships
due to a due to relationship and is that
yeah is that really a bad thing
apparently it was consensual and which
of course is not bad at all like you
know you should be able to have a
consensual relationship at work as long
as it doesn't affect your work now
whether it's affecting his work or not
who knows their parent was going on for
a while so maybe it's just an excuse to
fire I don't know who knows but they've
apparently got rules from 2011 so they
apparently that's in their rules from
2011 you're not allowed to have
relationship with employees but he meant
you know 1990 many's then-wife in the
night of late 1990s I don't know so
there's yeah this is although the affair
took place you know before he ever took
the role as CEO and that's that's why
people were kind of like you know I
don't know I'm kind of like you're like
I don't care as long this this kind of
stuff is just it because it's company
policy right he's the CEO you know I'm
sure the board of directors
they were flipping flipping out over
this but it's just I just think it's
it's in private sector it shouldn't be
an issue I think in the private sector I
mean the public sector here in Australia
there's been a big thing about it and
that's a different story but in the
private sector it's the private sector
you get paid for your work if you work
and you're doing your job well I
understood what relationships have to do
with that especially when a consensual
of course the funny bug is going on
that's a different story again but yeah
I mean you met your wife at the Eric
cool booth there was no those no
problems there was that era cool brought
you back again this year didn't they
yeah it was really funny because she you
know that now that she's working on
we're just trying to get things sorted
here and there and so she's just taking
on her job in Germany right now
full-time and and so it was kind of
funny to come back to Eric cool and
she's kind of like working with me now
just like hey guys I still yeah it's a
really cool guy she's on my side now
yeah you guys anymore but I was asked
though this guy like I don't know much
about this story I frankly I cared too
much about it when I first read the
headline but this guy I assume he was
married with kids when this happened it
was okay so so this was an affair like
he was legit cheating on his wife then
right and so that would probably be I
mean if the guy was adding the image
yeah that can't be was if he was single
just messing around you know
like company policy Lola I bet you they
would have made a big deal about it
because he's married I'm sure he's got
kids much about this guy but you know
that that is a public image issue that's
a PR issue yeah that's exact
Intel is gonna play they're gonna play
the high card I don't plan for doing it
at this point now that I know that it's
different I know I know so it's well
that's what I mean it's not coming at
the policy itself isn't really where
it's playing off it's playing off the
image and I think that's the biggest
thing so I guess you always I mean for
Intel it's a smart move they always put
the policies in there and they exist so
they can enact them if possible to
something that's different you know in
its core it's more of a public image
thing that's what I think then the
actual policy itself so yeah you're like
you said if you were single it wouldn't
have been a problem I don't think that's
that's the truth of the metal yeah
anyway do we want to move over to
comments answer some Hawke comments I
actually don't even know if we the
donation things rekt anyway so do we get
any questions I've been kind of looking
one Naruto asked if you're wearing
eyeliner me oh yeah dude I'm like me so
pasty on your monitor and what okay no
I'm not wearing eyeliner
I get asked if I wear makeup in my
videos I think it's a lighting thing
yeah
what just sometimes you have up the
saturation and stuff cool do you think
my eyes look pretty does he think my
eyes look pretty I don't feel like I
think they look pretty I see what do you
say and it's like a natural beauty thing
you guys want I'll try some Milo well if
I get a 80s rock haircut then I'll put
some eyeliner on okay yeah I watch the I
watch that series stranger things man
that was so good if you like 80s themed
stuff it is they got the eighties music
to cut the eighties film style got the
80s haircut it was just heaven that was
like the drama to watch man I just love
that I was just like glued to the screen
season 1 season 2 smashed
bang now I'm waiting for season 3 and 4
which apparently the filming back to
back that was just such a cool drama do
that um strange things you gotta
appreciate 87 oh yeah eighties rock use
my man that's it there's everyone's
thing I think so I was thinking about
even what do you reckon Jar Jar we grow
up 80s haircut both of us and then we do
that's it
delivering the tech news with an
eighties haircut i think people will
like it I think we're it's ready for a
change things are gonna change around
here so the battle so anyway a questions
questions I'll move over to chat as well
which I conveniently don't have open I
believe but yeah we'll run through a
quick some quick questions is the risin
1700 a good deal right now instead of
the 27 600 X it depends on what you do
man for me I sadly I'd rather the 2600 X
I know I'm in a cup of a day for a bit
for me that latency thing is a bit real
lights real man they they drop the
latency big time and it for me it just
for me if for some reason just showed
that's all so and yeah that it's created
mullets all around yeah so I mean I'm
gonna get a molar I mean come on I got
talk bogan on the news deals hunts and
stuff yeah yeah we're good even some
80's rock haircuts coming back you big
green and you got some real thick hair
there brother you'd go it's annoying
yeah I let it grow it anymore like in
middle school I had really long hair and
it would just grow out like I always
thought it would start growing back you
know like longer like women's hair most
women's hair
this grows out like afro you know I go
you can definitely stall that though
it's probably something - yeah promise
train or something
so is it good to sell a GTX 1074 the
wind 300 bucks - I mean be good for
someone buying it if you wanna sell yeah
you'll get that easy for that sure what
gb can be bought fifty five dollars in
total USD 270x off the top of my head
they can go around for about 50 bucks
USD very nice card they're one of my
favorite cards actually the more I
appreciate that card the more I like it
- 70 X will still play 1080p games you
can get them for cheap they're sort of
there aren't they overs you know
overshadowed by whatever the 7970 in the
79 50 and then you know our nine three
three or two eighty and so yeah it's
such a good card man they just overclock
really well they don't use up too much
they don't drop a lot of heat in your
case and they still get good performance
is it worth upgrading of 3770k not if
you're just gaming no no solid CPU and
yeah so Verizon 1700 s yeah they're
probably clearing him out that's why
they're so cheap 278 Elzey dollars yeah
thank you 56 for 500 Ozzie is actually
really good price that's pretty solid
especially if you like the watch watch
got the free sync support that's yeah so
and take dundee how am i I'm all right
I don't know that's Korean I believe
your name is what's that mean in Korean
please let me know in the chat can I get
a good 144 Hertz build use parts of $500
it depends where you live if you hunt a
man it depends on your time frame as
well over time you can hunt such good
deals and you can piece together some
really good stuff I mean if you get the
monitor 400 bucks piece together
something 400 F initely up csgo run on
144 Hertz for sure for that price worth
upgrading an i7 4790 to 8700 K 444 Hertz
gaming depends on the game you play
again I mean it's it's an upgrade is it
worth your money just depends man I'd
say yeah you get you notice a difference
if you grab his card is big enough to
support it and yeah in the games like
csgo for example you get a big benefit
out of that and then yeah we got loads
another question here Brian how how
could I reach higher mem speeds on Rison
+ system I got g.skill 3,600 CL 16 but I
can't go over 3,200 speeds are up the
system-on-chip voltage that's usually
what it is give you system on chip
voltage especially if you can't even get
XMP profiles on up that voltage up to
1.2 is a good starting point might need
to go 1.25 give it a go if it doesn't
work after that then maybe your chips
limiting you and so you might have to
settle for like 34 66 or something like
that I mean you can go crazy on the
voltages but just be careful you don't a
recce gear so yeah alright 1066 gigabyte
or 580 with free sync tech it depends on
the prices if they're both the same I've
said it in the past I would just pick
these I would pick the
60 slightly over the 580 that's my
personal preference how about you Greg
1060 over the 580 yeah I think I 1060 I
prefer GeForce experience just because
I'm more familiar with it so yeah from
that standpoint sure yeah okay so any
recent issues with I'll Express not
shipping x 34 40s and p5 motherboards
they close my order citing security
issue very weird I've never had a
problem with Aliexpress I just got a few
Zeon's in 2x 34 40s and ax 34 30
recently so not sure what happened there
are you guys using tango out networking
for your needs for file transfers I am
down in my studio yeah I got tanking a
bit set up I'm in the process of
actually utilizing it fully still not
utilizing it fully but apparently azouz
have a router
I'll speak into Marko azuz tour have a
router that's very budget but you can
combine the three one gigabit ports to
get three gig speeds that's very
practical I want to check that router
out because that's super practical for a
lot of people especially in home studios
what does me still the question would
you still use a 70 30 50 K as a box open
or a keychain Greg I mean I used to be
on personally or a Core 2 Duo is my
favorite yeah and the that was still a
chip that I'd use a year to open up
boxes with because I never saw and
actually used for it yeah that chip is
they actually lower the price and I
think in response to a lot of the
backlash they got for the price thing
what like 170 180 MSRP on that ship it
was so outrageous like you get it a
locked i-5 for the same price and you
had four cores instead of two with HT so
it was just ridiculous when it came on
they were asking for that yeah okay what
do you think of Intel being behind on
ten nanometer and Andy being ahead with
seven nanometer I think it's a great
thing let the competition begin
now Intel they've got they've um they've
got some talent on board now so they
really recognized the threat right and
you see them with their mesh
architecture they're trying to scale for
more cause as well so they think as AMD
thought back with Jim Keller they
thought the future was more cause more
threats and so AMD designed from the
ground up to go with more
small threats of course I think for the
like all US tech enthusiasts really the
ring boss is still so relevant and what
Intel is gonna they're gonna improve
that or that it's gonna go straight for
a scalable architecture
I don't know remains to be seen I love
it if they did both but yeah I think
competition is always awesome seven nine
I mean - bring it on let's see Intel up
their game is that something gonna have
to do so boom okay more questions more
questions
it was EVGA SL i3 with 24 gig of ram 435
USD a good deal yeah 24 gig around is
good for that just the line I think 360
mil rads worth it depends what your
cooling ever built a 39 70 X system
we're gonna go one better than that dude
I'm building something soon on that's
gonna go better than that
it's Corsa 750d and giggity-giggity in
good case for custom water cooling yeah
it actually is anyway guys thanks for
all the questions - we're gonna close it
off do we gotta go stream over your side
the after-hours that's where we do that
with the viewers and answer Q&amp;amp;A then
after that I'm gonna hit up the gym
Brella and I'm gonna edit out the used
PC parts on whoo I don't know where
about this newfound energy man I'm just
like 28 you're making some really lazy
eye you spy your young gun man you've
got to be on your game you got that
energy to win man anyway that's it all
right we're gonna head over to Greg's
channel for After Hours if you guys want
to ask questions in chat then go for it
as always love all you guys with the
support as well videos are gonna keep
coming and they're not gonna stop so Don
Lee I don't hit the gym I do man I do
cardio dude you gotta be on your cardio
game I see a lot of dudes at the gym
just pumping up muscles and it's like
soul relevant a lot of them one guys
like he's pumping up his muscles at the
gym he's like telling me man how do I
get rid of my gut and I'm like dude you
just saw me on the treadmill yeah that's
the solution right there go get on that
thing anyway
so okay catch you guys later love y'all
and I'll catch shoes in the next one
sorry for the short short stream but I'm
blaming it on Greg yes Greg yep there we
go alright hope you guys if you have any
comments as well off as streams done be
sure to drop your car in the comment
section below and we'll catch you in
next time next week hopefully on normal
schedule on a Saturday American time
Sunday Australian time sorry for the
irregular schedule but we're sort of
both getting back into the groove as
well after that big hit that was copy
Tech's Greg's plus Greg had a little bit
of a break and well deserved it after
hours here we come see you guys need
peace after now don't be self a no by
yourself for now boy you are way to do
what p7m man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
