7850 versus the gtx 660ti in part 2 of
the old-school showdown now today we're
going to be taking a look at dx12 titles
and also some vulcan titles and some of
those latest games and we're going to be
comparing these two cards head-to-head
to see how they perform with not only
today's drivers but also in today's
games welcome back to check out city
this is brian coming to you guys today
with part 2 of the video where i'm
comparing the old-school 660ti versus
the old-school 7850 and not only to see
how far they've come in terms of drivers
which I did in part one with those
old-school titles but also to check at
how well they're doing in today's games
with also those new AP is both Vulcan
and also dx12 and I'm also been using a
program to monitor the frame rates and
you guys may be surprised with the
results so with that being said let's
get straight on into the benchmarks then
we can analyze what's been going on here
so the first thing I will get out of the
way with is the overclocks which I did
mention in part 1 as well they both
received a good 100 megahertz on the
core they're roughly the 78 50 I believe
the 111 megahertz and also the gtx 660
got like 105 so also the overclocks were
very similar so the performance games
out of the overclocked would also scale
very similar to the results but what we
saw this time around with the 660ti was
that it was handily beating the 7850 in
a lot of these titles especially the
really popular tiles if we look at dota
2 for instance it was slaughtering the
7850 by quite a bit
Oh quite a lot there however when we
changed over to Vulcan in dota 2 we
noticed a little increase on the 1750
but also a decrease on the 660ti which I
was kind of really surprised with
because I thought this API was meant to
utilize your graphics hardware better
than something like dx9 would in dota 2
so really surprised to see those results
in dota 2 especially but when we moved
over to doom we kind of saw that the
results were not really doing anything
for Vulcan on both the 7850 and the
660ti so that really surprised me as
well since I've been hearing such good
things about Vulcan I know it does have
that multi-platform support there but
I'm just wondering why it's not really
translating into any real gains when we
look at the games like doom and
especially dota 2 where we kind of would
really want those gains since we got the
old hardware and we need to extract as
many frames as possible out of that
hardware as opposed to something new
which will handily beat every title
absolutely fine so a little bit
surprised oh and also not to mention the
doom just would not load it all with
Vulcan enabled on the 660ti though when
it came to ashes of the singularity a
very popular dx12 benchmark I noticed
that the 7850 just gained practically
nothing same with the 660ti both going
from dx11 to dx12 there really didn't
gain either of these grabs cards any net
performance increase the one thing that
was interesting about this benchmark was
how the 7850 was virtually tying with
the 660ti so I guess it may show that
when AMD hardware is utilized properly
you can get some big performance gains
where the 7850 is now matching
660ti in this particular benchmark
they're moving on to a game like Dark
Souls 3 we can see that the 660ti
handily beat the 7850 with ease now also
another thing with the mighty number 9
which is a new game I noticed that this
game was capped essentially at 62 frames
per second so even with vertical sync
off I just couldn't get an accurate
benchmark or in other words both these
cards performed absolutely fine in this
new title at 1080p on high settings so
that's the highest settings that it
would go to so if you're looking for a
graphics card to play mighty number 9
then you're going to be happy with
something like a 70 or 50 or a 660ti and
then looking at this last benchmark time
spire which has kind of got some
controversy surrounding it I'm not
really going to go into it in this video
but we saw the gtx 660ti was beating the
70 or 50 by quite a bit there as well
that 30% margin is kind of coming back
into play here though one thing I
noticed with the time spy this time
around and I have tested this over like
a week ago is there's no option there
for that asynchronous support thing
anymore so I can't turn that on and off
so pretty weird I'll try and look into
this a little bit more I will also be
looking into the Vulcan results a little
bit more as well especially on the AMD
card the 7850 since I just didn't get an
increase at all in dota 2 and I didn't
really get an increase at all in Doom
which is where that game is really meant
to shine and especially since the 7850
is on the GCN architecture I was kind of
surprised to see that I was getting
little-to-no gains also some other
things I'll touch on is well before I
get out of here maybe a subjective thing
but I thought the gtx 660ti on the
Vulcan API in dota 2 gave the best input
lag in other words it gave the lowest
input lag so if you're a competitive
gamer in dota 2 you may wish to even
though you get a little bit of an FPS
drop there you may wish to turn that on
because I thought the input lag was
insanely low that was just the
subjective thing I'd have to do more
testing to give you guys an accurate
picture of that but also another thing
is one with my benchmarks they're very
consistent as well I test apples to
apples and since we've got two different
graphics cards here over two different
API it'd be something like apples apples
apples apples anyway that's about it for
me today guys if you enjoyed today's
videos and be sure to hit that like
button if you have any questions or
comments about today's graphics cards
are about today's
testin be sure to drop a coke a question
or a comment in the comment section
below and I'll get back to you as soon
as I can and also I will be doing some
more follow-up tests with Vulcan and
with the different api's on sort of
those more newer graphics cards because
the results I got here today we're
really weird especially on the 7850 with
bulk and I was supposed to although I
was expecting a bigger increase than I
actually got and also on the gtx 660ti
we're actually got a drop on dota 2
they're going switching to Vulcan so
kind of surprise there anyway guys I
will see you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye yeah say
clean your graphics card</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
