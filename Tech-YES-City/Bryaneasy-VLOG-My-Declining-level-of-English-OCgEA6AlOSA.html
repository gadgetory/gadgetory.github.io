my whole like a whole new atmosphere to
my vlogs kind of makes it more you know
entertaining i guess and i got the new
microphone in which is awesome and I'm
not recording on YouTube software this
time guys i'm using logitech webcam
capture software so hopefully the sound
sounds a lot better and also the video
quality quality is more better than it
was before so i let me know guys is it
is this time that is you know this time
around is my vlogs better than my other
vlogs like is the quality better is the
sound quality as well as that better so
let me know guys and I'm awaiting your
feedback so first of all let me say guys
today I am in good health now so I have
got over this norovirus I got over a
throat infection so I've almost come
down with every possible sickness i can
get and you know little bee today i was
a static he did his first brown poo in
like 10 days i think so that means he's
getting back to normal everything
spitting back to normal he's drinking
over a liter a day which is awesome he's
eating right and i'm happy yeah it's the
start of the saturday i slept well last
night it's awesome guys so I'm feeling
really good guys I got the new setup
just set up now so I'm feeling awesome
that I wanted to talk about one thing
today guys and that is your English in
Japan and when you live in Japan for a
long time how bad your English actually
gets so I've been living here for five
years now guys and I've noticed probably
in the last year I guess more than else
more than anything is that my English is
just starting to decline my the level of
my English is just starting a room and
so I I'm just wondering if that's the
thing just to do with age as you get
older did you English just get that bad
or is it just me living in Japan for a
long time but I think it's the latter
guys because I remember my friend three
years ago when i was leaving japan for
about a year and a half two years he
said to me is like Brian you know he was
living in Japan at that time for about
five years and he said Brian
your English gets so bags I remember
it's misspelled the word fridge and I'm
like how do you misspelled fridge and
he's like look just you know I've been
living here for a long time do it it
gets to you and I was like at the tunnel
at Nam and you just get dumped but no I
realized now because the other day i
misspelled the word q like snooker cue i
spelt snooker cue instead you know like
this sorry I mean the word q like
waiting in the queue I meant i spelt
that as snooker cue q ue and I was like
what the hell is going on here night you
know so I at that point in time so that
was like two days ago at that point in
time guys I said to myself damn you know
he had a point man my friend had a point
so and his name's Steve so Steve if
you're watching this man your point is
spot on your English gets so bad like
I'm just noticing now but what I wanted
to ask you guys is it to do with age was
just to me living in Japan and not
hearing English that much as I otherwise
would if I was living in Australia so
please let me know guys and also I've
been trying to actively you know keep my
English level sort of to a high standard
by doing things like reading the
bloomberg news and you know you've got
lots of wise people on there you know
making articles about anything finance
related I'll do like finance it is
interesting and I've got like the
news.com dot au articles you know that's
anything from you know someone
kidnapping someone to you know career
firing rockets in the sky claiming their
satellites all that stuff guys and I've
sort of noticed that you know like it's
yeah I don't know you know English just
let me know guys what do you do to keep
you if you're living in a foreign
country that doesn't speak English and
English is your native level and you're
sort of keeping your nothing's changing
things is still really good let me know
the tips that you guys use to keep your
English sort of up to that you know that
level that you know the kind of level
that you know when you're a university
student and you're just reading articles
every day day in doubt and your English
is just on another level so I want to
know how do you keep your English
phenomenally good or how do you keep
doing this good because I don't know
what I'm doing so I don't know if I'm
doing it wrong or if I'm doing good so
yeah I'm trying to improve my English
now that is like an active goal this
year so
oh I think more from two days ago it's
definitely an active goal of mine sorry
guys I yes so that's another thing guys
and English in Japan the people who have
lived here for a long time I think your
English level starts to degrade over
time so and I think it's I've noticed
that you know with myself in the last
year so anyway guys it is true it's
gonna it's like a disease it's going to
plague you if you live in Japan for a
few years so let me know if you have any
tips to combat it so hey guys I've
rambled on enough here is just a quick
vlog I wanted to know what you guys
think and also big thank you guys big
kisses mwah so awesome guys thank you

growing like the new YouTube layout is
phenomenally good I think it's helping
small channels which is a really good
thing and so small channels are kind of
gaining the exposure that they would
otherwise not get and I think that's a
really good thing you know it helps out

much time to put into their videos but
