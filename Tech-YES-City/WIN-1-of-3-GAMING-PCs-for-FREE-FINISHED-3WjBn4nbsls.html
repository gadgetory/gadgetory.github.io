getting given away to one of you guys
internationally and I'm also teaming up
with Steve from hardware on box and also
Greg wait I think I got that wrong I
think it's Grug from science to do
welcome to the new world but here we
goes back to the main prize behind me
the PCs these will be getting given away
internationally three different pieces
across three different channels so all
you have to do to enter is click on the
gleam link in the description below
there's no funny buggers this is just a
big THANK YOU for me anyway personally
for hitting 200,000 subscribers Steve
recently hit a hundred thousand
subscribers and Greg recently passed two
hundred and fifty thousand subscribers
and now we've all met each other in real
life especially at Computex we had a
blast and we all love each other's gear
that came out wrong but anyway let's
take a look at the PC that I'm giving
away this is a Rison v 1500 X system
with the cooler master master box light
five this is a really inexpensive case
fifty dollars so won't set you back and
it's also got a real lightweight slide
acrylic panel now tempered glass isn't
for anyone I've personally already
shattered a tempered glass slide so
something like this really does make
sense especially at this price point and
especially if you savage like me and you
really work fast with PCs when you're
putting them together now the graphics
card we're going with a gtx 1050 TI this
is from a brand called hood or torch
core now I got this in Japan so it is a
JVM model doesn't need a 16 connector so
it is very clean and of course with a
1050 Ti it's pretty fast now for the
memory team have sent out their Delta 16
gigabyte kit this is RGB memory really
nice stuff looks awesome and it also
performs awesome to team groove are also
nice enough to send out there l5 light
240 GB SSD which will give you guys five
boot times and also enough storage to
put on
favorite games like csgo or dota 2 now
for the water cooler cooler master sent
out their master probe 120 which is of
course a 120mm in the radiator and it
includes two fans however I have put on
an RGB fan so changed it off a little
bit and there's also an additional three
RGB fans that have been installed in the
front also those fancy red lights you
see in the background is coming from the
gigabyte be 350 gaming motherboard
really nice board for the money looks
good and also performs really well too
and last but not least powering all this
is the v6 50 from Coolermaster it is a
gold rated power supply and it's also
fully modular now is overkill for the
parts that are currently in there but of
course with power supplies they're
always a great component because you can
upgrade at any time for instance the
motherboard will allow you to put an
eight-core in the future and a better
graphics card and this 650 watt power
supply will be more than enough to power
the future requirements but air goes
quickly telling up how much all these
parts would set you back if you were to
go out and buy them yourselves it's a
whopping 890 USD so this PC is no joke
it's the real deal and it will perform
pretty well I'm sure I still have to
benchmark it i've only literally just
put this thing together
so I will have to overclock it and I
will be doing a separate video on how
well this thing performs however that's
enough of me rambling on if you guys
enjoyed this video and be sure to hit
that like button and let me know in the
comments section below if there's any
games that you want specifically tested
on this PC and I'll make it happen also
with the previous giveaway that I did
with hardware on box for the monitors
the winner in the Philippines
Christopher he sent in a photo so he was
really happy I won almost forgot the
giveaway will run for two weeks from
this date and we will announce the
winners on all of our Twitter feeds that
science studio hardware unbox and tech
yes city so you guys stay tuned best of
luck I hope you win and I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
