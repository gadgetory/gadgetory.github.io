Part 2/2</b></h2><h5 class="post__date">2018-07-26</h5><div class="container"><div class="video-responsive"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B428xPqefjA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="post__text">so over about a week ago here at tech
yes City we released a video talking
about monitors and gaming packs and
whether that can upsell your computer
I'll put the link up here if you guys
want to check that video out because it
kind of is important for this video part
two where we talk about the results and
how things went and that's exactly where
we come to the crunch of it was an
incredible success let's take a look at
how both these rigs sold and then we'll
take a look at some strategies that you
can employ if you're a used PC parts
hustler
welcome back to take your city and first
things first the Core 2 quad this thing
was borderline potato and we had this
listed for 290 Australian dollars I'll
put the USD pricing up on the screen for
you guys over in the US as well and it
was listed for over a week and it just
would not sell I did have a few offers I
had two offers actually one coming
through at 240 another 250 I actually
accepted those offers but the people
never came through to pick up the pcs
and so I'm sitting here on this piece
now I'm thinking well maybe we can try
an experiment to upsell it and the 22
inch monitor that I picked up in a used
PC parts deal which was an absolute
bargain really made this combo come to
life it's a 1050 by 1680 resolution I
believe it's 16 by 10 so it does run a
little bit easier than a 1080p monitor
at least on the graphics card so when
people came around and saw this PC they
instantly bought it so a didn't the
monitor keyboard and mouse really didn't
cost me any extra because I picked them
up in deals that I got for an absolute
bargain but here's where things get
interesting because they then listed
this PC up for three hundred and forty
dollars the next day someone came in
three hundred and ten and I accepted the
offer and it was practically an instant
sale so not only did I sell the PC very
quickly but I also got an extra 60
Australian dollars over a previous offer
that never came through so that leads us
to the question of is the monitor
keyboard mouse worth 60 straiten dollars
and I believe in my case I picked it up
for really good deal
so that $60 was easily made because of
the deals that I got when people throw
out their monitors and they don't
realize that they can really help upsell
a gaming PC so essentially the crux of
the first deal was if you can get those
monitors and keyboards and mice that
people are chucking out when they do
deals definitely take him because they
will help upsell now what about the next
PC I had up for sale there was an i5 rig
we put in a mediocre graphics card and
we put this whole package up for 550
Australian dollars and this is where
things were an overwhelming success as
well I throw in a keyboard and mouse
just like the previous deal and this
sold the next day for the
in Chryse so I was absolutely blown away
this gaming combo pack can deftly help
sell your pcs it's another option out
there that I'm sure a lot of people are
looking for when they go to buy a PC but
if there's not many of those options out
there
then they'll deter away from just buying
a box because then I have to go out and
buy the keyboard out to go and buy the
mouse I have to go out and buy the
monitor that's a lot of hassle if
someone's got the whole pack ready to go
then the asking price sometimes doesn't
look that bad and especially if you're
coming from the console which nowadays a
lot of people are doing since they're
coming over from those console games and
a lot of times they can be an optimize
they run like crap and they've won a
play on PC especially games like
fortnight that are becoming very popular
gaining a lot of traction and do play
better on a mouse and keyboard but wait
there is still more when I was cleaning
up the studio there was a monitor
Samsung monitor I picked this up for 60
dollars
1080p monitor I then had a workstation
lying around chucked a gravis card in
that Chuck to hard drive in it and we
then had a pack that was just over a
hundred dollars about a hundred US
dollars and we put that off a sale for
$500 and it's sold instantly again for
the asking price so gaming combo packs
if you guys can get the monitors the
keyboards and the mice if you can get
them as I said earlier in deals they
will definitely help upsell pcs that's
the experiment that I've run here today
it does work and the reasons it's
working is because people just want to
get one go one deal and they want it
right then and there
and if you can deliver that as a PC part
sauce or so on the flip species
occasionally then I do recommend it hope
you guys enjoy today's video if you did
then be sure to hit that like button let
me know in the comment section below
what you think about this monitor and
keyboard and mouse upselling PCs love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
