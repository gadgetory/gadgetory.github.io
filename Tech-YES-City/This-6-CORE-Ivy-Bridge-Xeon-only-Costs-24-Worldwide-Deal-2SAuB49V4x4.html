I do use PC Parts Hounds
here on the channel,
people complain that
they can't get the deals
that I can get.
But right here on the table
we've got something that
is readily available.
And hopes to be some of the best value
I've seen in a long time.
For instance, I got a motherboard here,
and yes that is how the
motherboard came in the mail.
I guess the postman had a
little bit too much fun here.
We got this for $49.
Now, it's LGA 1156.
That's right, not 1366 which is X58.
It's actually a special
breed of motherboard
that supports Sandy Bridge
and Ivy Bridge chips
which were made specifically
for this motherboard.
They were mainly intended for
small businesses and servers
that only needed one computer,
and didn't need to link
up more than one CPU
since they are limited
to a QPI link of one.
And then besides that,
the benefit of this is that
it supports registered memory
which can be had for very cheap.
I picked up two sticks of 8GB each
for a total of 16GB of
DDR3 memory for $35.
And the CPU itself is the E5-2620 v2
which is a 6-core 12 Threaded Xeon
on the Ivy Bridge architecture
that also supports PCI-E 3.
Then for the CPU core that 12 box
has a fan on it, and it
has two little towers,
and hopefully it can keep
this thing under wraps
but I don't think it should be a problem
since it is non-overclockable
and it is pretty efficient already.
But then we're going to
couple that with a GTX 1660,
which is one of the better
value cards from NVIDIA
on their new series.
And see how that compares then,
at 1080p gaming, versus a 9900K.
So with all that aside,
let's get our $121 barebones
kit on the test bench
and see how it performs.
(upbeat techno music)
So there's a little bit of
trouble here in paradise.
And one of these two sticks is faulty,
and I thought at first
it was the motherboard,
when I tried booting up the motherboard
it just kept giving me an error
upon Windows installation.
But then I changed the
memory around finally,
and everything is working absolutely fine.
We're just getting games
installed right now.
But one thing about this motherboard,
is it doesn't look too bad so far,
I mean, in the BIOS
you can even set the RAM
speeds up to 1866 MHz,
which isn't too bad.
And also this cooler
seems to have a bit of
RGB bling going on inside
so let's get on with the gaming results,
and then come back to some other tests
on this system directly.

(electronic drum beat)
- So we just finished up the testing
and I'm gonna say before
we move into the numbers,
I am super impressed.
This is a new meta going into 2019
for people who want budget
builds or budget gaming,
and it's readily available
and they live anywhere in the world
this is definitely going
to deliver LGA 1356
plus this 2420 v2 Xeon
and 16GB or 8GB of DDR3 memory
whether it's registered or not,
is going to be kickin' hard for the money.
Now, the motherboard itself, it costs $48,
so it's going to compliment that $24 CPU,
and since we can then couple
it with that cheap cooler
which is $12, and also the cheap memory,
we've got ourselves a combo
that will handle a GTX 1616.
We'll get into the numbers here,
and at 1080p high settings gaming,
Battlefield 5 on the single player
was getting around 89 average FPS
when we did over a 70 second benchmark
40 FPS, 1% lows,
and the 0.1% lows did dip to 10.
But I'd have to say that
had to do with the fact
that we used a hard drive here,
since the game was still
downloading in the background.
Moving over to Apex Lujends,
we saw 100 average FPS on the dot,
and then the 1% lows were 65
and the 0.1% lows were 43 FPS.
This was a 1080 pretty much max settings
except the texture
setting which was on 4GB
which is still high.
Then on to CS GO.
We had 1080p high settings
here, max settings going 166 FPS
on the community made benchmark,
57 FPS 1% lows and then 10.1% lows.
Move over to Tomb Raider, the
last game we started the test.
We ran the benchmark, 1080p
high settings DX12, 68 FPS,
and then the minimum scored in at 47 FPS
so the whole time across these
four games, except for CS GO,
the other three, we saw the
GPU being utilized over 90%,
which was a really good thing
considering how cheap this combo is.
Now, taking a quick step
back with this platform,
I didn't even know this existed.
I mean, I may have
heard of it in the past,
but I never really paid
any attention to it
because when I heard LGA 1356,
I thought, Oh okay is that LGA 1366
just a different variant?
But it's actually an improvement on 1366
in the server market
where it's still carried on
the triple channel memory,
but it was then supported for Ivy Bridge
and also Sandy Bridge.
And in the case of Ivy Bridge
CPUs it had 24 PCI-E 3.0 lanes
and that was sort of
different to the 2011 socket,
as you know with things like X79
which supported 40 PCI-E Lanes,
but also had the QPI Score at one.
So you could interlink two CPUs together
to be a double cores, double threads.
But I do see motherboards out there
that do have two CPU sockets.
So I'm not entirely sure
what's going on there.
But in the case of the
motherboard that we got here today
it was only $48 which is brand new,
and that includes shipping.
And it was using a H61 license,
so it wasn't actually using
X79 like it says on the box,
It's actually using H61
which is very cheap to get,
and also has Dual Channel
memory support maximum
as we can clearly see on the board itself
only having two dim slots available.
Now, the VRM of course,
it does look a little bit lackluster,
but since we are only
pushing 36 Watts through it,
it did do absolutely fine
even with no heat sync and
in 25 degrees ambiance,
we saw it going up to
a maximum of 60 degrees
with the thermo imaging camera.
So there it is with this combo.
I think it's phenomenal value for money
considering we're getting the
whole kit here for 121 USD,
which is really cheap
Alls we'd have to do to get
this build fully finished,
is add an SSD or a hard drive,
case power supply, and our graphics card,
and in the case of the
graphics cards itself
you can use an RX 570.
Great value for money on the
used market, the new market.
It would go very well
with this combination
to get a really good build,
even brand new, under 300 USD.
If you guys wanna see that happen,
I'll make a build happen,
using these components.
I think it's just
phenomenal value for money
I'm super excited that
I found out about this
and it's really good,
I think it's going to be a new meta,
where a lot of used businesses
will now be retiring these Xeons
there's just gonna be a
flood of them in the market,
and at $24 I think it's
going to be very hard
to beat this kind of value.
I did manage to run also
a Cinebench R15 score,
and we got over 600 points,
which again for $24 buy it now,
is freaking amazing value for money
I can't harp on about how
good the price performance is
with this combination.
Now, another good thing is
with the low clock speeds in
the six scores twelve threads,
is you do get the low power consumption,
but also on top of that
a lot of games are coming in with DX12,
and supporting more cores and more threads
and we can see that the
game play is very smooth
and if we couple it with
something like an RX 570,
or if you want to go with a new GTX 1660,
then a combination like this
is gonna be absolutely fine.
Also on the case of the
memory being faulty,
that's just one of those things
that happens when you buy
other used or new parts,
in a cases of DDR4 Memory
if you buy that new
it can sometimes be faulty.
In this case it was used memory
and I'm pretty sure the
seller should have tested this
before they sent it out
as it's pretty clear
that it's not just like,
weird randomness faulty,
that's clearly faulty when
I'm trying to install Windows,
and it's failing before it can
even install Windows itself.
Anyway, there's probably
a lot more you could do
with this CPU and combination,
like make a home server or a NAS,
but if you're making a NAS do keep in mind
that it's only got three sider ports
on this particular board.
And I've never heard the
brand name before, EastVita.
So everything did check out
though when I was playing games,
and it's just really
phenomenal value for money.
I can't bring that home enough.
And with that said I'll leave
all the links for the stuff
that I bought for this video
in the description below.
