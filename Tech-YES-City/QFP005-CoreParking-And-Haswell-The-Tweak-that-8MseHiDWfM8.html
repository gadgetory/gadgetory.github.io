know you guys been waiting for it
because I've been wanting to do it and
basically this time we're going to be
looking at a reg tweak called core
parking and basically you know I'll show
you at the end if you want to disable
core parking i'll show you how to deal
with a simple reg tweak and before i get
on with my results i will say that this
regedit week may make a difference on
AMD platforms it may make a difference
on sandy bridge or pre Sandy Bridge
platforms as well and i'm going to say
let's get on to the results anyway that
first of all on has well it did not make
a difference at all so we did
battlefield 4 and i held off on making
this video because i wanted to test
battlefield 4 which is an 8 threaded
game and i wanted to test it on a 4 7 70
which i was able to do at work and now
battlefield 4 basically as you guys can
see here i disabled core parking in the
regedit week there's two values you have
to enable or disable and i'll show you
at the end anyway battlefield 4 showed
no difference at all so looking at the
results here they'll virtually identical
there was no real big discrepancies
between either results so I tested it
three times 25 second benchmarks exact
same settings on the game ultra with two
speed MSAA on a gtx 670 and the results
were just they just were you know
basically the same there was no real
difference here so this was the first
one was battlefield 4 47 70 and it just
yeah just really there wasn't nothing to
write home about I didn't the FPS with
the same i was getting 102 with core
parking disabled then I was getting 103
with core parking on so just didn't make
a difference for battlefield 4 as you
guys can see here what I'm doing is
frame latency testing some testing the
actual every individual frame and I'm
testing the marking the differences here
and just seeing if there's a difference
and there was not a difference really
there's nothing to write home about here
both with it disabled and with it on
provided a really smooth experience
moving on now to Skyrim this was done on
my 4670k because I'd ready done these
results before I was going to make this
video but then with battlefield for
coming out a thought me I wait and test
it on that so this was my 4670k at 4.6
gigs
again with the gtx 670 and core parking
disabled with the reg tweak enabled this
showed these results it's important with
this game it also showed 157 average FPS
with core parking disabled versus with
it on showed 161 so was with just the
default leaving the regedit week alone
you gotta slap bit more FPS there and in
my opinion the results were pretty same
when it came down the frame latencies
there was no big discrepancies between
either you know as you guys can see here
these frame Lancey results are really
really really good this has done on 120
Hertz monitor obviously the frame rate
was there no vsync was on so there was
no max you know max frame rate got up to
almost 200 I think so 188 to be precise
but this yeah it just shows no
difference there's no real big
difference here this is just both played
like butter so moving on now to the last
one which is heroes of newerth which is
a multiplayer game and you know
obviously these two tests aren't the
same because you know here's a new earth
it's got different variables so this is
going to be a game with different
variables in it and the tests aren't
going to be identical but again you can
see no big difference is here like
there's nothing to write home about um
you know both I guess core parking with
the regedit tweak enabled scored the
worst frame you know but there's nothing
to write home about the average frame
rates were actually pretty similar again
so there was just no difference so this
is on house well i'm going to show you
know with me doing my research and me
doing enabling this tweak and then
disabling this week i didn't notice much
of a difference now however it is
important to know that people on the
eight core AMD fx-8350 s and 80 320s
have noted a difference i would love to
get my hands on an FX 8350 and
pacifically test this core parking tweak
and test with frame latency tests I
would love to do that but I don't have
the money to get a FX 8350 rig at the
moment so I do but you know I'm not
gonna I don't know maybe if you guys
really want to see it I might maybe
after Christmas I might get an FX 8350
and a you know 990fx motherboard and
maybe do a he / guides for you guys a
heap of testing against you know a lot
of people are requesting me to test the
46 70 k vs the fx-8350 as well so anyway
the bottom line is is that it makes no
difference on has well and i'm guessing
on ivy bridge as well because when i did
the frame Lance he testing for skyrim i
had core parking on the default I didn't
touch that reg tweak on my ivory bridge
as well and I got a pretty much a
similar curve to this one so I'm going
to go out on a limb and say it doesn't
make a difference 5e bridge as well so
it may make a difference with Sandy
Bridge and pre Sandy Bridge platforms on
the Intel site I'm just not sure now to
enable this tweak let's have a look we
go here we go to type in regedit and you
just open it now you can always change
this value back as you can see here as I
over not read yet it's already there but
i'm going to show you what to do from
the start okay so you want to go over to
here and you want to click on computer
and then you want to go to edit and you
want to click on find and then you want
to type in here c 1 DF / 4637 i believe
i've typed it in that much that I
remember and it should actually find it
should be the first thing it finds I
think I got that right yeah that's the
one so you type it in this this first
one it's found like a you know Lasky
that it's fine that makes a regedit for
its own search I think so I just keep
searching until you find one that pops
up with max value and this is the one
here you want to double click on this
and you want to change it to zero and
then you want to click OK and then you
want to click Edit find and you just
want to keep finding it and value max
change it to zero click OK and that will
disable core parking that's if you guys
want to disable it now the good thing
about this is you can always change it
back by just doing the exact reverse
typing in 64 and then hitting Enter so
keep that in mind don't click 100 put in
64 so that's the main thing to remember
don't put in 100 if you going to change
it back put in 64 and then press ok now
you just click that you click close it
and then your restart you computer
I'm not going to restart because I'm
recording for you guys and then call
parking will do this it will be disabled
and you can always enable it in the
future so anyway that's that guy's arm
lastly I will say yeah if you guys like
this quest for perfection please give it
a thumbs up I'm going to be testing high
precision event timers going to be
testing interrupt moderation for in ICS
next quest of the fashion is going to be
pretty in-depth I'm going to be testing
another one as well I forgot what it was
throttling that's right a throttling reg
header regedit hack as well so I mean
testing three eight three of those and
seeing if they make a difference as well
but in the meantime I'm going to get our
limp and see that core parking really
doesn't make much of a difference sorry
also before i go i will say power
consumption as well I might as well at
home I did some testing with a kilowatt
here and with core parking disabled so
that's what the reg edit tweak applied
on idling on the desktop it was around
98 watts and during heroes of newerth it
was running around about 220 watts with
the reg edit tweak enable of default
without it touched at all it was idling
around 98 Watts again and in games
around 220 watts again so there was
virtually no difference between it being
disabled and with it enabled again I'd
love to see how it stacks on an AMD
fx-8350 so if you guys enjoyed this
video please give it a thumbs up and if
you haven't already subscribed to takia
city because i'll be given away truant
shirts in the future this isn't actually
an official Tron shirt i just bought
like this nice it's a really comfortable
shirt i bought it from the arm big soup
big sort of shopping mall thing placed
down the road and it's really good it's
like one of those pasta shirts and it
actually supports you back and makes you
sit up straight so really good for your
health anyway anyways I hope you enjoyed
this video and I will catch you soon if
you have any questions as well please
send me a PM and I'll get back to you as
soon as I can the YouTube comments
section is still pretty damn bad it's
not to do with the actual delay out I'm
getting used to it's a fact that I
can't post replies this doesn't even let
me it says you're not allowed to post a
reply to this comment and I'm like what
the hell it's my own video nearly I
don't know what's going on there i'll
probably make a ran on it later for you
guys if it's not fixed i'm giving them
some time to fix their mess up but
anyway i'll catch you guys soon with
another video on battlefield 4 and ram
speeds and i hope to see you guys soon
peace out for now grannies ebay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
