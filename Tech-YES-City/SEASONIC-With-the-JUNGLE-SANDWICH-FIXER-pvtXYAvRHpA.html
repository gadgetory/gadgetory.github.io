sonic booth
and they've got some new concepts going
on that are pretty damn cool the first
one being there
modular cable management system they
actually don't have a name for it
officially yet it's really early in the
design phases but as you can see here
you can plug all your cables off this
one module system and then from there
just a really short run from the power
supply to the system itself it's going
to be great for system builders who want
to make that real clean look see sonic
promised me that they're only losing one
percent efficiency overall so you're
really not losing much but you've got a
lot to gain in terms of the rear of your
case and the aesthetics also saving
those cables as well so if you've
watched some of my videos in the past
cables have been running everywhere like
a jungle sandwich essentially I'd like
to see them fix this thing and call it
the jungle sandwich fixer but that's
what's coming in the works they've also
got some other products to stay tuned
we've also got an interview with Sam
from see something he's gonna tell us
about the power supply is what goes in
to them and also why they're some of the
best in the business
hey mates mm 18s can't be text coverage
was brought to you by gigabyte and
course here bringing you that gear that
you need to put in your PC and build pcs
welcome back to tech yes City and right
here we have another new design coming
in from C sonic and if the power supply
dies and you're in the server market
bang just take it out replace it put a
new one back in and you are now good to
go also with this system you can double
down the power so if you've got 800
watts here and you're like I want to add
another 800 watts to the system grab
another unit plug it in
that's what C sonic are bringing to the
server industry as well as giving an
integrated design with OEM manufacturers
with simple designs that come into the
budget if you're NZXT for example you're
buying a lot of bells wise they've got
that covered for you as well so here we
are now at the C sonic power supplies
and I'm joined by Sam how you doing man
I'm pretty good how you doing really
good loving the environment here at
Computex 2018 and behind me now we've
got the mainstream Focus gold and
platinum bow supplies but also got niche
products besides that and then we've got
the flagship titanium series as well
we're gonna run through the Focus Gold
Series first though what is so good
about this lineup of power supplies here
basically focused you know and then
focused plus series are you know see
Sonic's bread-and-butter
you know technically speaking you have
your you know your platinum efficiencies
your gold efficiencies and a semi
modular variation as well you know we're
trying to cover up the entire range of
you know budget builders somebody that's
looking for you know quality but at the
same time functionality as well so you
know we're kind of trying to cover you
know from ranges from 5 54 54 to semi
modular all the way up to 750 you know
for full modular variations you've got 5
56 57 58 50,000 you know if you know you
want some type of reliability you know
see sonic is the way to go and at the
same time you know we also got you
covered with a long warranty as well so
you know you got nothing really to worry
about at this point so now with the
niche products here with see Sonic's
power supplies they got the snow silent
Edition obviously as the name implies
snow white they've got this in a built
on display here as well and then they've
got a new one the air touch so what's so
special about the air touch I believe
you're telling me five stage fan
controller
as well right yeah that's right Brian so
it has a five-stage fan control if you
just spin it this way a little bit we
revamped the hybrid fan controller
button that you see on the focus and a
prime series but basically we put an LED
in there just to you know indicate what
fan mode that you're actually in so
that's Brian said before there is a
five-stage fan controller in there from
silent all the way to to low rpms all
the way up to like you know max you know
max flow basically this power supply in
a nutshell is for red and black theme
builds you've got the same pots going in
from the prime series that is going into
this it's built really well got five
stage fan control I don't know what else
you'd need it's also 170 mile in length
now going in lowest sizes I believe 550
watt 650 watt Nunda you then dropped
down to 140 ml in total length of the
actual unit itself of course picking
these things up they are really heavy
and you get what you pay for with C
sonic power supplies and that's pretty
much the best we're gonna move over now
to their flagship which really is the
best let's see what that's about here
behind me now is the granddaddy the
finale of power supplies I was not gonna
chuck it pretend I'm gonna chuck it but
this is what you get when you want the
best is this right Sam that is
absolutely correct the prime platform is
our flagship models it goes from a
titanium platinum and gold efficiencies
basically comes up to titanium is the
highest wattage we about 1000 watts all
the way down to about 750 watts I
believe and then you know when you move
down over to a platinum versions we go
up boost that up to about 1300 watts now
so it's perfect for anybody that likes
to do video rendering have multi-gpu
setups you know same thing for the gold
as well and we also on this side if you
want to take a look we have our you know
the highest wattage fanless power supply
that you could get on the market at this
point completely silent there's no fan
at all just I'm not really sure what
more you can want with the power supply
which organ complete silence so if you
don't even want a fan in your power
supply this is what the prime titanium
600 fanless series will do now I know
there's guys out there who go OCD about
noise I actually sold a computer and I
had to that someone brought the PC over
and I
to pull out the fan because they'll
complaining that it was going full-speed
now this was one of course as fans it
was just completely whisper-quiet and I
was shocked I was like wow people must
really get OCD about noise and that's
why pounce plays like this now exists
right just absolutely no fan and now
you've got the ability to power up to
600 watts what about over power on these
it basically has all the same
protections that you get on the prime
platform you have ovp OCP everything
that you need if anything goes wrong it
will shut down that one particular port
and everything else will still
completely they'll still stay on so yeah
basic it's really nice you know there's
really not much you can you know what
more you can want for a power supply so
now I'm gonna get on some questions with
Sam one thing that I'm really curious
about is when other manufacturers use
see sonic as an OEM I've never really
heard much of the story behind it I've
just heard but you know when companies
are you know they're using see sonic
inside those power supplies you know
it's good you know okay that's we're
gonna buy that it's good what goes on
behind the scenes there are they using
just the PCB or are they making their
own steel cage for it or what well
basically what other companies do you
know like Corsair EVGA for example they
you know give us their specifications
and details and we build it for them in
our factories you know you know get the
same type of quality that you know we
put in our own products but you know at
the same time you know those companies
are basically just you know just
branding retail companies that's at this
point power supply manufacturers you can
probably only name a handful of it you
know in the entire world there's not
many people to actually do it see sonic
however you know we make our own brand
our own sell our own so now big thing
that's on my mind is well companies like
say sonic they pride themselves I'm
having a good product now part of that
good product is definitely quality
control right can you tell us what goes
in behind the scenes with quality
control with a say sonic power supply
quality control that our company you
know is pretty intensive and excessive
at you know at every single point we run
it through the rings put a max wattage
you know the lowest load that you can
possibly have and at the same time you
know we put it in hot cold testing you
know put it through the wringer pretty
much and we're pretty confident in our
quality control that's why we can
actually support a 12-year warranty for
the focus after ten seven years and
essentially all those components inside
are rated to that year life at that max
potential right yes so all our
components are rated to be you know to
be very very long-lasting that's why we
can't sport and backup our warranty
claims so it's sort of a you're not
gonna blow your house up with a safe
sonic power supply no you're never gonna
blow anything up there you go guys so
basically see sonic aunty home blowing
up power supplies really good thanks for
having me Sam
oh thanks for stopping by our book right
