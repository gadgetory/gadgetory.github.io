reach even for jack reacher
though a pieces end up to Z to 80 PCIe
gen3 4-speed 480 gigabyte SSD may change
just that coming in at 215 USD it may
just be the change makers that you've
been looking for
welcome back to text it is brand coming
to you guys today with my first review
of an nvme drive albeit an MDOT - this
is a paisans first nvme drive as well
coming in with two separate flavors the
480 gigabyte model and also the 240
gigabyte model under the same banner of
the z28 II though getting straight into
the meat potatoes sausages and grilled
cheese we can see that this is a small
little naked drive so you do have to
handle them with a little more care than
you would with a 2.5 inch encased SSD
though the positive is that it makes my
job easier as I don't have to pull the
thing apart to get a glimpse of what's
inside and looking at the flash banks
they're using two sheep of 120 gigabyte
banks with this model using four for a
total of 480 gigabytes attached to a
nano 256 megabytes rebirth bank which
runs through a fire and controller
interesting choice though I'm sure what
will please most people is that they're
using mlc type memory instead of the TLC
type based stuff that's coming out in a
lot of SSDs today and this particular
model is rated at 2 million hours
meantime before failure and then there's
the speeds let's take a quick look in a
s SSD benchmark the Z 280 scored in
another league compared to the crucial
bx 100 that i have here on the test
bench though the 4k random reading
rights were dare i say still in the same
league i ops were heavily in favor of
the z 280 however the one to another
benchmark are using that is HD tune Pro
where I do a tangiwai file transfer
sometimes even larger depending on the
drive and if it shows some mishaps
though in this case there was no mishaps
to report both drives performed really
well they're rated read and write speeds
and what this means in particular for
the z28 II is that the fighting
controller that they've used on this
model has consistent read and write Al
Gore
so as you can see with the raw numbers
there this thing crushed any standard
solder SSD that I have around here
though taking a look at the real-world
benchmarks to see how much faster your
PC will boot and also how much faster a
game like Battlefield 1 will boot showed
it to be not too much of a difference
though where you'll find some solid
improvement over SSDs is if you are
dropping and scrubbing massive amounts
of files in Premiere Pro for example or
doing other work that involves heavy
usage of your storage device so there it
is Z 2 ADL is actually going to do this
review after I did the Panther memory in
another review though but when I saw the
performance of this thing and more
importantly the price and the features I
rushed it to the front of the queue it
quite simply is amazing for an MDOT to
nvme to cost this little and perform
this well me personally I always used to
turn away from MDOT twos and in PCIe
nvme drives mainly because of the price
they usually commanded a big premium
over the standard 2.5 inch SSDs though
with the z2 84 may pay so you really are
getting it all great performance good
memory more probably a damn competitive
price and we're looking at this model
coming in significantly cheaper than the
competitors m2 nvme SSDs out there it
certainly makes this a contender to be
reckoned with anyway great job from a
pesar on this SSD and I'm showing up
just myself but a lot of other people
are gonna have their eyes keenly on a
peso to see what else they bring out in
the near future is this product is just
gonna be an absolute hit and that's
about it guys this is Brian signing out
from tech city and I'll catch you guys
in another check video very soon also
don't forget to plug that like button
and I'll see you in the next one peace
out for now bye
also before I get out I had no problems
whatsoever on both my ex 99 Tai Chi and
my ex 99 MSI board however I did have a
problem when it came to cloning the
actual drive from my main OS SSD drive
to the nvme drive the true akron as'
image software didn't work at all so if
you want to clone your OS to this nvme
drive you might have to use some other
software out there this people is the
fact that they're using mlc type memory
in this drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
