just coming back to you guys today with
a look and unboxing of the m-audio fast
track it's actually been taken over by a
big recording studios I think so this is
officially the avid recording studios
model so you guys when you get the mold
you open it up and you get just a box
and you dry this in your software your
unit and your speed cable so that's all
you get when you get this now
interesting thing to note is this device
is powered by this USB cable and it is
used to send the signal to your computer
back to them for coming from the
computer so let's have a look at the
main unit itself guys so here it is guys
the m-audio fast track this is the basic
model and it's the number two but even
though it doesn't say number two on it
is number two so basically we get a 48
volt phantom powered microphone port in
which will basically this will let you
record on a condenser microphone and it
will let you report on a dynamic
microphone if you have this switch here
which you can turn on and off so if you
turn it off you don't have a microphone
turn on you can use your phantom power
microphone so that's just my baby
getting so you've got a USB port here
guys so that's the obviously preparing
the device and I'll transfer and you got
a white out which is all I'm gonna need
guys so one line out here which I can
plug to my camera and I can use it to
amplify the signal to report on a
condenser microphone to my video camera
which is good very handy so it's got one
RCA it out left and right channel stair
Apple okay let's have a look guys we've
got Mick gain on the top so very feels
very smooth like the button feels very
solid and the guitar gains the same girl
and the app puts the same do the notes
feel very sturdy and smooth the unit
itself even though it's lightweight and
made of plastic it feels very solid like
it feels really well built guys so it's
a good unit
overall it looks pretty good and it
feels pretty good now it's good
obviously you've got your guitar options
at clipping signal and you've got your
ears on here which is a 1/4 1/4 inch
stereo jack and yeah guys you can do and
you can direct more to that so you can
turn that on off and on easy and you go
ahead phone out there
just great gonna need us so another
thing no but this goes 24-bit 48
kilohertz guys so high-quality Dax and
ADC is on board this so great you USB
interface I'm going to be using this for
a USB soundcard and I'm going to be
using this to power my microphone so I
guess without further ado let's get on
to let's get on a do a test so I'm gonna
do a test with my BAE ring of b1 and see
how this combo how well this combo does
so let's get on to the test hey YouTube
we are just doing a quality test now on
the m-audio so let's pause for a few
seconds now and hopefully you heard no
noise whatsoever now if you heard me on
if you heard any noise it was probably
my heater in the background or my birds
chirping and whistling away see you guys
this is a great value unit and the
microphone I'm using is a bearing of b1
so you can check that out in the
description below if you want to see a
review on that but I think this
microphone coupled with this preamp is
an awesome combination guys I had the
only trouble I had with this little M
audio unit was first installing it on
Windows 7 64 bit so I just had to
download some new drivers but after that
it seems to be going around so I've only
been using this for two hours now guys
and I thought I'd share the quality of
this unit with you so the volumes are on
about 60% now so I could crank it a bit
louder but I've kind of found my Suites
but I believe with this microphone and
ya guys if there's anything you need to
know about this M audio please let me
know or anything you want to know about
the microphone please let me know and
I'll get back to you as soon as I can
and of course if this review has helped
you in your purchase decision please
subscribe and help me out anyway guys
