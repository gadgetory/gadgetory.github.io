it's called ramen muggle portal and it
is in torg on it ramen muggle portal so
guys this place makes a good rum and so
I'll show you once we get inside what
the ramens like so and what the menus
like to so actually I think this might
be enroute oh for sure it's like yeah my
city tour gun is like neighboring right
next to
Naruto the animation named after the
animation exact same spelling too and as
always there is a cue from so there is a
queue so I need a good ramen there's
usually a queue will be little Brian
Jenny BJ wants to eat it he can't wait
dear have a bit that's in a few months
time when he can eat not at the moment
okay guys we are sitting down we are the
table and we have just ordered our ramen
ago so I out of this one here this is a
on door um fortune fortune moment so
happy breathe in car to unit and they
got many different Romans what's this
 top ramen and rebellious to show
you down there
this one here and say you so long yeah
you got many different ramens here you
guys and they've got limited scissor
they got you know yeah standard
dumplings and all that stuff fried rice
but yet come here mainly for the ramen
sir this is actually a private chain
here on the barrel in school and you
know they're not a big chain stores it's
really good I recommend you guys if
you're until garnet or around this area
I recommend your company and to get
around he recommended to but baby you
recommended to hey you guys are sorry I
haven't made a video in a while to us
and I'm so busy I've been making a book
so halfway finished I'll make a book for
my industry where they're almost
finished but I am on some all this
and i'm going to show you what does with
obama good size okay guys so this is
ready to eat so basically my one you get
pork like it's real nicely cut talk it
tastes so good and it's like in this
special stew what would it be and you
get an egg it's like half kind of
half-baked it's on a half poached I get
half boiled and it's really nice and
there's my why you gotta be so wrong
it's a different taste so anyway guys
it'll be many want Stacy it smells so
good he wants to have a try sir
attention anyway guys we're going to
chow down and enjoy this wonderful rump
oh yeah and that's the result after you
get a good ramen it's all gone
it's really hit or hit or miss you know
so if you guys have tried ramen and you
like I tried it it's you know so so you
know there are really good ramen shops
out there you've just got to keep trying
to do it you know so my advice is keep
keep trying Roman until you find the
right ramen shop I finally found a good
one and it's awesome so it's almost as
good as pizza so I love pizza it's my
favorite food and it's all me that place
is almost as good men did guys so guys
