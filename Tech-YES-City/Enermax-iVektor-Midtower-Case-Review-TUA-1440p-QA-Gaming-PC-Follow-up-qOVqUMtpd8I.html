do a quick Q&amp;amp;A about this little bad boy
that I recently built and that's the
underappreciated thank you guys there
was kind of like a hybrid review and QA
of this case and the build that I
recently did the underappreciated so
let's get straight into it though but
the first half of this video will be the
review of this case and then the second
half of this video will be a Q&amp;amp;A about
the recent 1440p video that I did
answering questions to do with modding
this case and the components inside so
the NE max I vector is essentially a
mid-range case that is targeted towards
people with value and money for mind now
the availability of this case is
something that's interesting because I
couldn't find it for sale anywhere in
America though in Japan it is for sale
for about $60 and for that price you are
getting a pretty good case so when I
first got this case in I was impressed
with the build quality it does feel
pretty sturdy without being too heavy
though some people who like heavy cases
especially people who like things like
their fractal define are for probably
not going to be in the market for this
case it is about half the weight of the
r4 so it comes in at about six and a
half kilos though it is pretty well
built and the first thing you probably
going to notice though is this rubber
sort of hard rubberized material on the
front here I don't even know exactly
what it is is probably a soft plastic
but it does feel really good and it does
feel really well made but if you can
probably look closely you can see that
the color balance is a little bit off so
that's one thing that I'll critique
about the outside of this case but
besides that everything the case size
comes off really easy the front and the
rear also the buttons feel really sturdy
except on the top of the case the power
button and the reset button are kind of
awkward to press I kind of found myself
having to figure out a technique on how
to do it so it's a little bit annoying I
would like to see them implement a
better power and reset button on this
case but the jacks or the USB and
headphone out
absolutely fun also looking at the top
there you've got the option to mount
radiator and mount a push or pull
configuration for a 240 millimeter rad
as well as the fact that you can also
just put two 120mm fans and their two
exhaust air out at the top we'll bring
it in
also let's have a look quick look at the
front here so we've got a grill here to
actually put in that enables air to come
in now one thing I will critique about
this is it does add to the noise so
probably the dust filter they have used
is a little bit hindrance to noise so
you will find yourself incurring a
little bit of noise so if you take it
out noise will improve a slight bit and
the fans that they've included so
they've included 140 millimeter fan at
the front here and 120 millimeter fan at
the back to give you two fans in total
the front fan does actually blow quite a
bit of it air though it does have blue
LEDs and as you can see I've actually
cut the blue LEDs and turned them off
completely because I was going with a
black red and white theme for this build
they're looking at the actual other fan
you can actually move this fan down and
install two fans in the front here so
looking at the drive bays you've got
three 5.25 inch drive bays which I think
again is a little bit excessive
especially for a mid-range case though
for Drive options you do have the option
to mount seven 3.5 inch drive bays and
300 aux arias should I say or 3 3 3.5
inch drive bays and 4 2.5 inch SSDs go
down the bottom it kind of looks like
you could fit an SSD though in
practicality it just didn't work because
you can't get access to these other two
sides of the screw unless you only like
two screws screwing in your SSD then
intact and essentially you could put in
8 drives in this thing which is pretty
good there's a lot of room to work
around with it also if you've got a
really long graphics card you can also
take out this bracket here and then I
essentially just have only three book
drive bay options there so that's
another choice as well so they're giving
you room to work around here with this
case looking at the rear of the case
this is probably my favorite part of the
case so now the Mac's have really
implemented this well the rear of the
case allows you to
just manage cables so easy so it says
about five centimeters of clearance
between that in the case then the case
actually has a further dent out there
which would probably be another two
centimeters so you've got around about
seven centimeters to work there in that
main core area with a lot of options to
zip-tie things off so they've really
implemented the cable management
solution will they really given you
options to manage cables as you saw in
this reason build I fit a whole 650 watt
non-modular power supply in here with no
problems it was really roomy to work
with and it's something that other
budget case manufacturers should take a
look at with their cases so looking at
the side of the case they've got the
window coming out a good two centimeters
like they do on the rear of the case and
then they've got an acrylic window
installed here I don't expect them to
put glass in on a sixty dollar case so
that's not something that I'm not going
to critique although it is pretty well
made and it could take a beating also
down the bottom of the case here you've
also got the option to mount a 120
millimeter fan which I have taken
advantage of and put it in a push
configuration besides that you've got
the option to mount your power supply
which goes in with ease nothing to
complain about there at the bottom of
the case you've also got four feet there
and you've got to dust filters which are
made of plastic one thing I will
critique here is that I don't like these
plastic type of dust filters I do prefer
the steel mesh dust filters as I believe
not only do they feel better they also
do a better job of collecting and
stopping dust in my opinion so that's
something I'd like to see them implement
even if it does add a slight bit extra
to the cost of the case so near the rear
of the case is kind of a mixed bag
because I like what they've done with
the exhausting here that put a mesh here
to exhaust that put the mesh here to
exhaust the rear fan and then they've
added options for water cooling as well
so that's something they've done well
here and they've got the handle here for
the side panels which is a nice little
feature as well I'm having a closer look
at the PCI Express ports is where a
little graph happens they're actually
removable and you can put them back in
though one thing I found when I was
mounting my graphics card is that the
screws were too big and so I actually
ended up ripping off the mid point
connection there for my graphics card
just to get room to plug in my cables
properly so that's something that I will
say
might want to look into that and install
a graphics card and just make sure that
you can get your cables in because
you're either gonna have to get a
different screw and lower that pci
bracket a little bit so you can lower
your graphics card or you're gonna have
to rip it out like I've done some
conclusion this case is actually built
pretty well there's no sharp edges the
included fans are pretty good though
they're a little bit noisy though the
best thing I like about this case is the
switch on the top here as you can see
here I've actually hot-wired this from
the front fan so I can turn the fans off
and the LEDs you can also switch it to
the right to have your fans running in
silent mode which I do prefer because it
is quieter if we turn those fans on full
even though the airflow is better the
noise actually becomes audible so it's
something that I'd like to see them
improve on because I know Animax can
make fantastic fans as seen with the T 4
T there are CPU cooler though that that
being said I mean the kit the case
although this case does get a
recommendation and things like the
brackets are easy to arm take off and
put in they've also included brackets
for the hard drives as well which allow
you to take in and out the hard drives
and SSDs with ease and they're actually
pretty solid they're not flimsy they
don't rattle while your computers in use
so I will give them a thumbs up for that
so a quick recap this case is pretty
much good to go it does get a solid
recommendation from me though one thing
or a few things I'd like to see them
improve on quickly would be those power
buttons would be that rear PCIe bracket
configuration and also the noise of the
fans if they could do it but all in all
this actually makes a really good case
airflow is pretty good temperatures are
pretty low in this rig I do not have one
problem with the temperatures inside
this case as well built really well no
sharp edges cable management's
phenomenal you've also got a side window
there for bling-bling and it's good to
go so anyway if you guys have any
questions about the anti Mac side vector
let me know in the comments below but
anyway let's move on now to the question
and answer for the underappreciated so
this is the PC that I recently built in
my 1440p ultimate build guard and you
guys thought it was pretty cool and you
guys had a few questions that you wanted
me to follow up on and so I'm going to
follow up on that these
since now basically the LEDs you grab
them off eBay there are two dollars 50
for like two meters of this stuff you
can also grab different colors any color
that you like a lot of colors and then
you basically stick them on so you just
stick them on there I've decided to glue
them off with silicon and then you can
wire the LEDs with the soldiering iron
so you will be you will have to solder
if you want to do this properly and for
actually getting it to the switc what I
actually did was I used the front fans
wiring since that was already wired to
the switch I then spliced that to the
bottom fan and the LEDs and that enabled
it to switch on the LEDs and off and
then go in silent mode with the LEDs off
so it is a great thing that this will it
is a great option that this fan can do
or this switch can do that and I do it
does add kind of like a cool feature to
the case but anyway let's quickly move
on to some other questions so the next
question I got asked a lot is the custom
spray job on the heat sinks basically
it's metal and it's unfinished metal in
case of the graphics card and the CPU
heatsink
what you have to do is you have to get
good paint and I'm not gonna recommend
crap paint like that acrylic stuff that
you get for a dollar that is absolute
trash I don't recommend spraying that on
your heat sinks you'll not only have a
hard time with it running you'll have a
hard time just getting it on in general
and it'll look horrible so basically if
you're gonna spray-paint your heat sinks
do it right and do it probably the first
time around but just trust me it's one
of those things that you learn from with
experience and I'd rather spare you guys
from doing it the hard way so basically
if you want to spray up your heat sinks
go get some metal on the body paint this
is the first thing I would do and now
the second thing I would do was get
would be to go get some proper car body
spray paint this stuff sticks really
well it it's made to handle harsh
conditions even if you've got to pay a
few extra dollars for it I would
recommend it highly recommend it over
the standard cheap acrylic that you
get at the hardware store so for the
spray paint get a metal body under paint
that almost went off get yourself some
proper car body spray paint and then
you'll be able to get on track and get
these heat sinks to the color you like
now another thing as well make sure if
you're spraying in a particular season
to adhere to those conditions so I would
like for me I'm spraying in the winter
so one thing about spraying in the
winter is you'll want to spray when the
winds low and then you'll also want to
spray warm up your paint before you
spray so warming up your paint would
just be put it in a room that's a twenty
to twenty-five degrees wait until the
spray paint is a little bit warm if
you're going to do like I do and stick
it in front of the heater make sure that
you're not making the spray can too hot
especially a full can of paint was that
crap going to explode so just be very
careful but just get the paint warm and
then once it's warm you can shake it and
it'll spray on so good if you spray on
cold paint it'll just go everywhere in
big blobs so that's something to
remember about the actual spray
conditions as well now quickly the RAM
heat sinks so they just I got them off
eBay for a dollar spray them up and then
I put them on the RAM that makes the RAM
look kind of red the actual color I'm
using is a Honda red I'll show you guys
specifically what paint I used in the
metal underbody paint as well even
though it's a Japanese brand though you
can find something similar and most
likely cheaper at your hardware store so
lastly with the grams card as well if
you're spraying it up you will have to
take off the heatsink and that will
involve unscrewing all the screws there
if you don't have any replacement
silicon heat pads just take them off
very slowly and put them somewhere
because you're gonna be putting them
back on right also with the actual spray
job of the heatsink itself this will
give you a good chance to clean up your
graphics card board as well as put some
new heatsink paste on which was what I
did when I put some artic silver 5 on
this actual graphics card I managed to
get temperatures that were 5 degrees
lower at the same ambient temperatures
also another thing is will these spray
painting of the heat sinks add an add a
layer of insulation there which will be
detrimental to performance and
technically yes right you any spray
paint will add
a layer of insulation on there though
one thing to keep in mind is if you're
using dark colors like black especially
that'll absorb radiation better and can
actually help reduce temperatures in
some rare circumstances before what it's
worth
we're not gonna go into a big argument
of convection and all that physics
thermodynamics but for what it's worth
it doesn't make a big difference right
there's unless you're spray-painting a
huge amount of paint on there which I
don't recommend temperatures aren't
gonna change that much at all so there's
nothing to worry about so just get some
good car body spray paint and go at it
and you know this is essentially how I
sprayed it up I took my time and I just
gave thin coats as well when I'll
spraying it so maybe get some practice
on some cardboard as well that's a good
recommendation you can get your sort of
spray technique down pat and make sure
you're getting no runs before you try
and do it on the heatsink though for me
though yeah it was it's pretty quick
it's easy so anyway that's about it for
the under-appreciated I mean the actual
spray paint here again it was just me
printing out a piece of paper cutting
out the letters and then spray-painting
a bit of white and red paint on there so
that's pretty easy to do as well so I
hope that answers a lot of the questions
I mean if you have any more questions
about this rig then please drop a
comment in the comment section below and
I will get back to you as soon as I can
though I can't say that this whole build
was a fun experience it was it was a fun
thing making all this build work
probably so know if you have any more
questions about the underappreciated the
bill they used in the 1440p Ultima bill
guard then drop a comment the comment
section below but I hope this answers
most of the questions as for the tuning
yeah I used the b85 pro-gamer from a
Zeus I can highly recommend it it's a
great board though if you get it and you
are doing what I'm doing just get that
initial bias revision it allows it to go
a little bit higher and that's about it
guys for the the underappreciated I hope
you enjoyed this video if you did please
get a thumbs up if you have any
questions or any more questions about
this build then drop a call in the
conversation below and I'll catch you
guys later another build peace out for
now bye
thereby meadow question still lingers in
that exact can a player but crushed me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
