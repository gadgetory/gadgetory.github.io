do a quick Q&amp;amp;A about this little bad boy
that I recently built and that's the
underappreciated welcome baby so I guess
it is Barranco my back you guys there
was kind of like a hybrid review and QA
of this case and the bill that i
recently did the underappreciated so
let's get straight into it though but
the first half of this video will be the
review of this case and then the second
half of this video will be a Q&amp;amp;A about
the recent 1440p video that I did
answering questions to do with modding
this case and the components inside so
the NM acts I vector is essentially a
mid-range case that is targeted towards
people with value and money for mine now
the availability of this case is
something that's interesting because I
couldn't find it for sale anywhere in
America though in Japan it is for sale
for about sixty dollars and for that
price you are getting a pretty good case
so when I first got this case in I was
impressed with the build quality it does
feel pretty sturdy without being too
heavy though some people who like heavy
cases especially people who like things
like their fractal define r4 are
probably not going to be in the market
for this case it is about half the
weight of the r4 so it comes in at about
six and a half kilos though it is pretty
well built and the first thing you
probably going to notice though is this
rubber sort of hard rubberized material
on the front here I don't know exactly
what it is is probably a soft plastic
but it does feel really good and it does
feel really well made but if you can
probably look closely you can see that
the color balance is a little bit off so
that's one thing that I'll critique
about the outside of this case but
besides that everything the case science
comes off really easy the front and the
rear also the buttons feel really sturdy
except on the top of the case the power
button and the reset button are kind of
awkward to press I kind of found myself
having to figure out a technique on how
to do it so it's a little bit annoying i
would like to see them implement a
better power and reset button on this
case but the jacks of the USB and
headphone out
absolutely fine also looking at the top
there you've got the option to mount
radiator and mount a push or pull
configuration for a 240 millimeter rad
as well as the fact that you can also
just put two 120mm fans and air exhaust
air out the top or bring it in also
let's have a look quick look at the
front here so we've got a grill here to
actually put in that enables add it come
in now one thing I will critique about
this is it does add to the noise so
probably the dust filter they've used is
a little bit hindrance to noise so you
will find yourself incurring a little
bit of noise so if you take it out noise
will improve a slight bit and the fans
that they've included so they've
included one hundred and forty
millimeter fan of the front here and 120
millimeter fan at the back to give you
to fans in total the front fan does
actually blow quite a bit of a air
though it does have blue LEDs and as you
can see I've actually cut the blue LEDs
and turned them off completely because I
was going with the black red and white
theme for this build though looking at
the actual other fan you can actually
move this fan down and install two fans
in the front here so looking at the
drive bays you've got three 5.25 inch
drive base which I think again is a
little bit excessive especially for a
mid-range case though for drive options
you do have the option to mount seven
3.5 inch drive bays and three or sorry
or should I say or three are 3 3.5 inch
drive bays and 4 2.5 inch SSDs go down
the bottom it kind of looks like you
could fit an SSD though in practicality
it just didn't work as you can't get
access to these other two sides of the
screw unless you only like two screws
screwing in your SSD then attack then
essentially you could put in eight
drives in this thing which is pretty
good there's a lot of room to work
around with it also if you've got a
really long graphics card you can also
take out this bracket here and then I
essentially just have only three book
drive bay options there so that's
another choice as well so they're giving
you room to work around here with this
case looking at the rear of the case
this is probably my favorite part of the
case another max have really implemented
this well the rear of the case allows
you to
just managed cables so easy so it says
about five centimeters of clearance
between that in the case then the case
actually has a further dent out there
which would probably be another two
centimeters so you've got around about
seven centimeters to work there in that
main correr with a lot of options to zip
tie things off so they've really
implemented the cable management
solution will really giving you options
to manage cables as you saw in this
reason build I fit a whole 650 watt non
modular power supply in here with no
problems it was really roomy to work
with and it's something that other
budget case manufacturers should take a
look at with their cases so looking at
the side of the case they've got the
window coming out a good two centimeters
like they do on the rear of the case and
then they've got an acrylic window
installed here I don't expect them to
put glass in on a sixty-dollar case so
that's not something that I'm not going
to critique although it is pretty well
made and it could take a beating also
down the bottom of the case here you've
also got the option to mount a 120
millimeter fan which I have taken
advantage of and put it in a push
configuration besides that you've got
the option to mount your power supply
which goes in with ease nothing to
complain about there at the bottom of
the case you've also got four feet there
and you've got to dust filters which are
made of plastic one thing I will
critique here is that I don't like these
plastic type of dust filters I do prefer
the steel mesh dust filters as I believe
not only do they feel better they also
do a better job of collecting and
stopping dust in my opinion so that's
something I'd like to see them implement
even if it does add a slight bit extra
to the cost of the case so near the rear
of the case is kind of a mixed bag
because I like what they've done with
the exhausting here that put a mesh here
to exhaust that put the mesh here to
exhaust the rear fan and then they've
added options for water cooling as well
so that's something they've done well
here and they've got the handle here for
the side panels which is a nice little
feature as well I'm having a closer look
at the PCI Express ports is where a
little graph happens they're actually
removable and you can put them back in
though one thing I found when I was
mounting my graphics card is that the
screws were too big and so I actually
ended up ripping off the midpoint
connection there for my graphics card
just to get room to plug in my cables
properly so that's something that i will
say that
might want to look into that and install
a graphics card and just make sure that
you can get your cables in because
you're either going to have to get a
different screw and lower that pci
bracket a little bit so you can lower
your graphics card or you're gonna have
to rip it out like I've done some
conclusion this case is actually built
pretty well there's no sharp edges the
included fans are pretty good though
they're a little bit noisy though the
best thing I like about this case is the
switch on the top here as you can see
here I've actually hot-wired this from
the front fan so I can turn the fans off
and the LEDs you can also switch it to
the right to have your fans running in
silent mode which I do prefer because it
is quieter if we turn those fans on full
even though the airflow is better the
noise actually becomes audible so it's
something that I'd like to see them
improve on because I know animax can
make fantastic fans as seen with the t40
there are cpu cooler though that that
being said I mean the kept the case all
in all this case does get a
recommendation and things like the
brackets are easy to arm take off and
put in they've also included brackets
for the hard drives as well which allow
you to take in and out the hard drives
and SSDs with ease and they're actually
pretty solid they're not flimsy they
don't rattle why your computer's in use
so i will give them a thumbs up for that
so quick recap this case is pretty much
good to go it does get a solid
recommendation from me though one thing
or a few things I'd like to see them
improve on quickly would be those power
buttons would be that rear pcie bracket
configuration and also the noise of the
fans if they could do it but all in all
this actually makes a really good case
airflow is pretty good temperatures are
pretty low in this rig I do not have one
problem with the temperatures inside
this case as well built really well no
sharp edges cable management's
phenomenal you've also got a side window
there for bling bling and it's good to
go so anyway if you guys have any
questions about the animax I vector let
me know in the comments below but anyway
let's move on now to the question and
answer for the underappreciated so this
is the pc that i recently built in my
1440p ultimate build guide and you guys
thought it was pretty cool and you guys
had a few questions that you wanted me
to follow up on and so i'm going to
follow up on that these
shins now basically the LEDs you grab
them off ebay there are two dollars 50
for like two meters of this stuff you
can also grab different colors any color
that you like a lot of colors and then
you basically stick them on so you just
stick them on there I've decided to glue
them off with silicon and then you can
wire the LEDs with the soul during iron
so you will be you will have to solder
if you want to do this properly and for
actually getting it to the switch what I
actually did was I used the front fans
wiring since that was already wired to
the switch I then spliced that to the
bottom fan and the LEDs and that enabled
it to switch on the LEDs and off and
then go in silent mode with the LEDs off
so it is a great thing that this will it
is a great option that this fan can do
all this switch can do that and I do it
does add kind of like a cool feature to
the case but anyway let's quickly move
on to some other questions so the next
question I got asked a lot is the custom
spray job on the heatsinks basically
it's metal and it's unfinished metal in
case of the graphics card and the our
cpu heatsink what you have to do is you
have to get good paint and i'm not going
to recommend crap paint like that
acrylic stuff that you get for a dollar
that is absolute trash i don't recommend
spraying that on your heat sinks you'll
not only have a hard time with it
running you'll have a hard time just
getting it on in general and it'll look
horrible so basically if you're going to
spray paint your heat sinks do it right
and do it probably the first time around
because trust me it's one of those
things that you learn from with
experience and I'd rather spare you guys
from doing it the hard way so basically
if you want to spray up your heat sinks
go get some metal on the body paint this
is the first thing I would do and now
the second thing I would do is it would
be to go get some proper car body spray
paint this stuff sticks really well it
it's made to handle harsh conditions
even if you've got to pay a few extra
dollars for it I would recommend it
highly recommend it over the standard
cheap acrylic that you get at the
hardware store so for the spray paint
get a metal body under pain
that almost went off get yourself some
proper car body spray paint and then
you'll be able to get on track and get
these heat sinks to the color you like
now another thing as well make sure if
you're spraying in a particular season
to adhere to those conditions so I would
like for me I'm spraying in the winter
so one thing about spraying in the
winter is you'll want to spray when the
Winslow and then you'll also want to
spray warm up your paint before you
spray so warming up your paint would
just be put it in a room that's a 20 to
25 degrees wait until the spray paint is
a little bit warm if you're going to do
like I did and stick it in front of the
heater make sure that you're not making
the spray can too hot especially a full
can of paint was that crap going to
explode so just be very careful but just
get the paint warm and then once it's
warm you can shake it and it'll spray on
so good if you spray on cold paint it'll
just go everywhere in big blobs so
that's something to remember about the
actual spray conditions as well now
quickly the RAM heat sinks so they just
I got them off ebay for a dollar sprayed
them up and then I put them on the RAM
that makes the RAM look kind of read the
actual color I'm using is a Honda red
I'll show you guys specifically what
pain are used in the metal under body
paint as well even though it's a
Japanese brand though you can find
something similar and most likely
cheaper at your hardware store so lastly
with the grams card as well if you're
spraying it up you will have to take off
the heat sink and that will involve
unscrewing all the screws there if you
don't have any replacement silicon heat
pads just take them off very slowly and
put them somewhere because you're going
to be putting them back on right also
with the actual spray job of the heat
sink itself this will give you a good
chance to clean up your graphics card
board as well as put some new heatsink
paste on which was what i did when i put
some artic silver five on this actual
graphics card i managed to get
temperatures that were five degrees
lower the same ambient temperatures also
another thing is will the spray painting
of the heat sinks at an add a layer of
insulation there which will be
detrimental to performance and
technically yes write you any spray
paint will add
a layer of insulation on there though
one thing to keep in mind is if you're
using dark colors like black especially
that will absorb radiation better and
can actually help reduce temperatures in
some rare circumstances but for what
it's worth we're not going to go into a
big argument of convection and all that
physics thermodynamics but for what it's
worth it doesn't make a big difference
right there's unless you're spray
painting a huge amount of pain on there
which I don't recommend temperatures
aren't going to change that much at all
so there's nothing to worry about so
just get some good car body spray paint
and go at it and you know this is
essentially how I sprayed it up I took
my time and I just gave thin coats as
well when I'll spring it so maybe get
some practice on some cardboard as well
that's a good recommendation you can get
your sort of spray technique down pat
and make sure you're getting no runs
before you try and do it on the heat
sink though for me though yeah was it's
pretty quick it's easy so anyway that's
about it for the under-appreciated I
mean the actual spray paint here again
it was just me printing out a piece of
paper cutting out the letters and then
spray painting a bit of white and red
paint on there so that's pretty easy to
do as well so I hope that answers a lot
of the questions I mean if you have any
more questions about this rig then
please drop a comment in the comment
section below and I will get back to you
as soon as i can though I can't say that
this whole build was a fun experience it
was it was a fun thing making all this
build work probably so know if you have
any more questions about the
underappreciated the bill they used in
the 1440p ultimate bill guard then drop
a comment the comment section below but
I hope this answers most of the
questions as for the tuning yeah I use
the be 85 pro gamer from Zeus I can
highly recommend it's a great board
though if you get it and you are doing
what I'm doing just get that initial
bias revision it allows it to go a
little bit higher and that's about it
guys for the the underappreciated I hope
you enjoyed this video if you did please
get a thumbs up if you have any
questions or any more questions about
this build then drop a call in the
conversation below and I'll catch you
guys later another build peace out for
now bye
babe I'm le vaudou questions still
lingers and that exact in a player but
crushed please</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
