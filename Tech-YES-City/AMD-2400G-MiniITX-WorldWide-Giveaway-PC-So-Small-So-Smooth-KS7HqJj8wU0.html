tonight depending on where you live in
the world because I will stop there with
that word world because this is a
worldwide giveaway that we've got going
on here so I'm teaming up with three
other tech tubers that's level one tax
tech deals and hardware unboxed and
we're giving away two whole systems and
also some other goodies as well
I know hardware and box is going to be
giving away a kit of ddr4 memory to to
complement this giveaway so there's lots
of prizes up for grabs here and my
system I'm gonna be building that here
today it's a 2400 G Mini ITX system that
is literally the size of my hand in
terms of how big it is it's a really
small system someone's gonna love it for
a home theater PC or a mobile gaming
system or if you're at university and
you need something to get you through
the break then this PC will definitely
do it for you and I'm gonna be building
that thing and shooting it here today so
let's get on with it
so here's the parts all here laid out on
the table we're gonna be doing this
build in the in wind chop and I
absolutely love this case now I've
already built in this case before and
that's why I love it so much it's such a
portable PC that's great if you're a
video editor for example or if you want
something that can just play games and
watch movies on the mobile or if you
want a home theater PC now with the
recent release of the 2,400 G we had an
APU that really kicked the pants out of
the Intel 8400 this thing can actually
play games at 1080p low settings that's
what I found
we've also got in here a jewel kit of 16
gigabytes of memory so two eight sticks
gonna be whacking that on the
motherboard here the X 370 gaming ITX
from asrock and then we've got an x PG
SSD here from a data as well 512
gigabytes that's going to be going in
the system too but for the cooler we're
changing things up and this is a big
thanks to PC case gear for sending this
out
they actually hooked us up the Rison
2500 G I had to pay for that because I
busted my previous 2400 G with the
broken D lid but they sent us out this
is complementary kit to really help with
the giveaway - and this cooler should
hopefully fit in this case because when
I previously did the Mini ITX build the
side panel was bulging out a bit so
hopefully this will fix that with that
aside what we're gonna do first is
update the BIOS on this and then we can
put the Rison apu in and complete the
build
so we just finished building this thing
we've installed Windows optimize that as
well got all the latest updates and that
cooler just fit in the in wind Chopin
who just cleared it so if you guys want
to put the cryo rig I think it's the c7
if you guys want to put that with the
2400 G in the Chopin it will fit so it's
running really well I managed to
overclock everything you can see the
benchmark here we've just finished the
UniGene Heaven benchmark we've managed
to get about 10% performance gain in
actual numbers so the CPU we got up to
3.8 gigahertz and the graphics we got
that up to 1.5 gigahertz now I did
manage to get it up to 1.6 gigahertz
however the problem was the system
actually just thermal tripped out it
just shut off while it was benchmarking
so was up and running at 1.6 but the
problem is is the little cooler I think
just couldn't handle the overclocks on
the CPU and the GPU and it's
understandable it's in like a little
mini ITX case there's not a whole lot of
ventilation in there the power supply is
not the best motherboard vrm on on mini
ITX Verizon motherboard isn't the best
as well especially compared to like a
Taichi or something so whole combo is
we've got a decent overclock here we're
going to test it out now see how well it
plays in games on pubsey and dota 2 so
let's take a look
so after we overclocked it it did play
pub G at about 50 FPS on the desert map
at 1080p on very low settings I did have
to drop the screen scale or the screen
resolution down to 70% so somewhere
between 720p and 1080p and at these
levels was actually pretty smooth and I
could enjoy this game of pub G I even
got a couple of frags and when we move
over to dota 2 it was 60 FPS on high
settings so that was even better this
was after the overclock the one thing
with dota 2 after about 30 minutes of
playing it did crash and it did have to
restart so the overclocks do need a
little bit more work but the game of pub
G was running really smooth for a very
long time I got into like the top 15 I
think it was or something like that so
it was a long match on pop G and
surprising that it ran better in pub G
than it did in dota 2 because dota 2
doesn't utilize as much CPU as pop G
does that games tends to use both CPU
and GPU pretty heavily so before I do
ship this off I will tune the overclocks
a little bit more for whoever wins this
give away PC though links are in the
description below if you want to put
together something like this and you
can't wait for the giveaway to finish so

the link in the description below big
thank you to you guys for being
subscribed and watching the content and
enjoying it as always and a big thank
you to tech deals hardware unbox and
also level 1 text for coming on board
with this and I look forward to
announcing a winner and showing you guys
on Twitter who actually won the giveaway
that'll be in a couple of weeks so stay
tuned for that
and also if you have anything you want
to see then be sure to drop a comment
the comment section below and don't
forget to hit that like button and I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon though also one thing before I
get on out here with this motherboard
the Z 370 has rock it didn't have any
BIOS settings to overclock the GPU the
MSI one that I got sent in with the
review kit you could actually overclock
the GPU portion of the APU via the BIOS
so I would like to see asrock implement
that because I do prefer overclocking in
the BIOS as opposed to overclocking in
Windows via the rise of master software
nothing against the software it's just I
like setting those settings fine-tuning
them and then saving them so you
them every time you bid up the PC you
have to rely on some soft way anyway
catch one another take video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
