Walton and his
friend Morpheus who have been eating
popcorn and making fun of me in my
comments section lately
so Smith birth I need a hand there's no
escaping reason it's time to check out
the Thunder x3 gaming chess from Erica
welcome back to tech yes City this is
Bryan coming to you guys today would
look at three different chairs from
arrow cool that's right Eric cool
interesting right this is the company
that makes really cool bench mount cases
and it's also now making chairs however
that question of is get worth it lingers
in the air and I'll try my best to
answer that in this video and with that
said we have seen in the last year the
emergence of the gaming racing chair
that typically costs quite a bit more
than your average chair though gives you
more durability comfort and a different
looking feel Eric will seem to stick to
this formula well and starting with the
commonalities between all three attack X
threes I have here the tgc 22 GGC 31 and
tgc 40 is that they benefit from
extremely good build quality with the
chairs themselves weighing in at a good
20 kilograms shipping weight assembly is
very straightforward and takes about 10
minutes though keep in mind the chair is
very heavy so be careful if you have
difficulty lifting heavy objects though
the benefit of the arrow cool chairs
especially versed the eBay chair I
bought a few months ago is that it will
practically fit everyone from small to
large sized humans with the maximum
supported weight being a hundred and
fifty kilograms or 330 pounds even lying
down each chairs backrest can be
adjusted with a steel lever to an angle
of 180 degrees so you can practically
use it as a bed or a device for
practicing your matrix skills there's
also the ability to rock the chair back
and forth with its own tension
adjustments which can also be locked too
and all the chairs have a hundred
millimetres of height adjustment which
are also designed around leather looking
durable PVC cloth though here's where
things start getting a little different
but
the three models I will start with the
tgc 40 and honestly I haven't seen a
chair this cool in a long time
it has this Darth Vader badass theme
going on with it and coupled with the
medium level of firmness it makes for
some excellent comfort and not just
cosmetics the model I have here is black
though there are four other accents of
color you can have with that tone of
black that is orange white blue and red
I personally think the old black just
looks so kick-ass with this design
further featuring two separate sections
of stitching with the sides and rear
being quilted and also the front being a
plain linear pattern on that note the
tgc 40 is a custom in-house design from
erekle and the x3 attack branding it
also features four directional arm rests
which can swivel in and out move back
and forward left and right and is also
height adjustable though there is no
included lumbar rest or headrest with
this model even though it is the most
expensive out of the bunch coming in at
349 Australian dollars or at least that
is the cheapest they can find it for the
next year I have here is the tgc 22 I
got this in black and red and I think
this model is the Comfort King out of
the group
it has a soft back and bottom and also
the included lumbar support and
headrests are quite soft too this model
also has that typical gaming race chair
look and can also do everything the more
expensive model can do except for the
armrest which are only two directional
that is they can only swivel and have
height adjustment the pillows also can
be adjusted and where they lie or can be
removed completely which is very cool to
have as an air travel pillow that is
very comfortable when you are out of the
house the tgc 22 also features two
separate sections of stitching with
color variants ranging from the old
black green and black light blue and
black blue and black orange and black
white and black and red armed black and
comes in at currently 279 Australian
dollars making it a great choice for
someone who wants an extremely durable
and comfortable chair then the last
model I received for review was the tgc
31 which I would like to think of as
more of a firm version of the tgc 22 and
also has a slightly different look with
again two separate sections of
stitching the midsection and inner
bottom have a quilted pattern and the
outside having a plain look the
cushioning of this model on both the
chair and the pillow was definitely more
fun and would suit someone who has a
preference towards a more stiff feel
when using a computer more true to the
racing car seat feel if I had to
personally describe it the tgc 31 also
has three directional armrests which can
be adjusted on swivel vertical and
forwards and backwards it currently can
be had for 349 Australian dollars or at
least again that's what the cheapest I
could find it online for was so now
moving on to a conclusion in comparison
with the other chairs I have here I will
say going forward there was no glaring
negatives with these chairs everything
was firmed there was no squeaking
installation was straightforward
although you will need a bit of muscle
on hand as they were quite heavy and
everything worked well and had a lot of
steel and strength throughout the chair
so which chair is for you Eric will have
definitely offered so much with this
lineup of chairs that I think they'll
have a chair for anyone who is in the
market for a premium feel and also
something that is definitely worth it
for the product you are getting and yes
they are more expensive than the eBay
$100 chair that I reviewed recently
though they are much heavier and I think
more durable as well that chair was more
or less for people who are of a medium
to small posture and all three tgc
chairs I have here are for people of all
sizes and also have more flexibility and
that they can be adjusted to acts as a
substitute bed if you were watching
movies on it Eric will also have a heat
more models on their website which I'll
put a link in the description below for
you guys to check out but personally I
love the tgc 40
although not having the extra lumbar
pillow or having no included headrest it
quite simply won me over from the get-go
but also that medium level of firmness
and that custom look was just so damn
epic I seriously can't get over how
badass looking of a chair this thing is
I think it is the best looking chair
I've seen trumping the look of both the
racing chairs I have here and the eBay
chair too though if you're looking for
the conflict King then the tgc 22 is
definitely the choice for you and if you
want the posture support King as I would
call it then the tgc 31 will definitely
be
to spark your interest and although all
three of the chairs are reasonably
expensive they will last the distance
and will be able to put up with quite a
beating I'm also told that you can
download these chairs in PC case gear
and also center comm if you have those
stores nearby so I definitely recommend
to try before you buy if you can as for
hitting the United States I'm not quite
sure though I will update the
description on any word I receive about
the availability of these products in
the US</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
