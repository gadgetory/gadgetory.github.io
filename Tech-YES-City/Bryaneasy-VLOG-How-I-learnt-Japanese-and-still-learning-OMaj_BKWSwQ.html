just come back with a vlog today someone
requests you know someone asked me how
how they learned Japanese and I wanted
to come today and talk to you guys about
how I learnt Japanese and what I did to
sort of you know come this far basically
guys in a nutshell I can't read and
write that well my congee is pretty bad
i can write a bit since i know the words
and then you just use the keyboard to
auto translate it so it's pretty easy
you know if you're writing messages and
stuff yeah i can speak telephone
conversations I can talk to people at
work I can talk to people in general I
can get by you know my Japanese is not
perfect but it's not bad either so
basically the tips for you guys if you
want to learn Japanese you really have
to find you know your own style you see
I for me I cannot sit down and read a
you know a textbook I hate it I can't
fuddy like that's you know for me it's
so boring i'd rather be you know either
playing video games or watching TV and
so if I do that I really you know I
can't study that way so basically I've
never really studied Japanese the only
way I guess I do my study as I go out
and I talk to people you know I've lived
in Japan for four years obviously if you
live here for at least two years i'd say
you'd start to pick up a lot of words
and you'd start to pick up a lot of
sentences my advice you know for me my
japanese really started getting better
when i went to the bar when i was single
every night and all pretty much talking
to girls learning more japanese you know
and sort of getting out there on my own
so if you want to learn Japanese guys
you've got to find what you like doing
and you know if you like if you like
reading books read books study up if you
like watching Japanese TV watch japanese
TV learn that way if you like talking to
people go out and talk to people you
know there's plenty of different ways
you can learn japanese and so you have
to find what you like to do so that's as
i'm just telling you how I've learnt
Japanese I've never really studied an
hour probably studied in total five
hours of Japanese
from a textbook I almost got my sign q
but I failed that I was two years ago so
yeah you know I hopefully one day I'd
like to get nique you that's like your
level two Japanese it's pretty much you
know you speak fluent fluent Japanese
but I don't think that's going to happen
any time soon and got a lot on my plate
at the moment yeah guys if you've got
any comments i live in comment section
below blue below and if you know
subscribe if this is a helping you out
so basically how do you study Japanese I
want to know how do you study Japanese
do you want to learn Japanese and you
know if you're in Japan send me a
mountain you know hopefully there's a
YouTube party soon too we can meet up
have some fun what not so you guys been
a while since I've done a vlog straight
up so I'm on summer holidays but i'm
making a text book at the moment so it's
pretty frustrating i got to make like a
90 page book for the school was up you
know sort of promised to principal yeah
i'll make a new textbook and finally
getting around to it now so yeah guys
that's it you know that's my that's my
way of learning japanese lejacq out and
talk to people learn new words you know
obviously if you're more enthusiastic
about learning japanese you can pick it
up really quick one year you could
probably speak really good japanese for
me it's taking a long time some you know
and trim I'm sort of like a pro cast the
need procrastinate or whatever for you
guys that's just a quick vlog coming
today you know how I pacifically learn
Japanese remind you there's you know
there's a lot of there's a lot of
different you know things in Japan you
can do to learn Japanese they've got
community classes so if you come to a
Magus like a big city like Tokyo they've
got actual people who teach Japanese for
free so you can go to like the community
center and you can learn Japanese for
free you know there's there's many
different ways there's people who you
know if you work at a high school i'm
sure other teachers or want to talk to
you and help you since i started working
at my high school a lot of people you
know really
just come and talk to you and you know
they really help you out and you know
they really took you know people are
lenient to so when you come into Japan
you can get by with English as well but
you know that's a sad thing you know you
can actually get by living here if you
teach English you can get by living here
without even speaking any Japanese at
all which is a sad thing you know you
want to learn Japanese but you can so
all in all you know when you come to
Japan sort of get out there and spit
dobisch eyes speak to people you know
and don't be afraid to be wrong that's
probably the biggest thing is that you
know especially the Japanese learning
English they they have a such a hard
time learning English because of this
barrier that are we going to be wrong
you know and if you're wrong then you
basically you're afraid of speaking so
these people like you know get a lot of
students in my school that they don't
even want to speak English because I'm
going to be wrong it's like because you
know you be wrong I'll correct you you
know that's how you learn so whenever I
learned Japanese I was sort of just
speaking the worst you know no one could
understand me when I so you know when I
was saying something this is what I was
first Lane it's like who's this guy
what's he saying and you know basically
but you slowly they'll correct you and
they'll be like oh he's trying to say
this and you'll be like yeah that's
right that's what I'm trying to say so
all in all guys just it's pretty easy
you know don't change dress you know
just get out there you know your human
being with a brain everyone's you know
DNA is not that different things like
ninety-seven percent three percent
variance and DNA on the whole earth so
I'm sure you can't be that much dumber
or smarter than you know other people so
yeah it's pretty easy just listen you
know the more you listen the more you
practice the more you get the hang of it
I guess I hope this information helped
you out if you want any more information
about learning Japanese in Japan I can
give you some pointers basically yeah if
you want to get like a certificate for
speaking Japanese every year they hold a
test in December they also i think they
hold it two or three times a year now
i'm not too sure but I know they hold a
big one in December and you can take it
it chooses a level
me and my best friend we've failed a few
times well I failed once he's failed
twice on me so you know yet yeah you
know I go I've missed out by like two
points which snows out of 400 point
something I got like 238 out of 400 and
also pissed off so I don't want to take
it for a while so yeah you know I don't
want to take the test for a while anyway
guys I hope this helped peace out but
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
