I don't know if you guys remember with
the first like used PC vlog I ever did I
had like a $40 PC and this was the
bother board that was broken but
ironically when I just did this PC it's
the exact same motherboard so one thing
that I didn't test till this date was if
the BIOS was faulty so I'm gonna quickly
pull that BIOS off put it on this
motherboard and see if the motherboard
still works
okay so we've booted this thing up now
hopefully we can get out a signal and
hopefully it works nope it's just
cycling the power okay so we just got
this computer tested out and it just
didn't give out a signal so pretty much
motherboards boss that's gonna put that
bass chip back in here and yeah I hope
you guys saw like look at this I mean
I'll switch on the power supply too and
you can see the lights on now and look
at this if I switch it off this is
something important if especially if
you're gonna clean up power supplies
this is how you discharge them turn it
off first and before you unplug anything
let that light come out but let it just
die down because then it's still juicing
the power from the power supply so you
see it's still on like I've turned it
off and that light is still going so you
can see how much some of these power
supplies like how much power they still
store even after you switch them off at
this at the wall so always wait until if
it's got a light on it that's a really
good thing because it'll tell you when
it's drained all the power from the
power supply completely so then it's
still go on it's pretty crazy
there goes just died down so that was
like I don't know maybe good 20 30
seconds but let's get on to the next
part of this vlog you
welcome back to tech city this is brian
coming to you guys today with the vlog
just stuff that's got to get done around
here also answering some comments and
the questions and showing you guys some
things so like a little off vlog as you
saw in the intro we're sort of tested
that out and that bias didn't work but
also another thing is i just sold the
computer here that one that i built on
the channel recently that's gone and
we're gonna get onto something else here
because i got given a 7970 so i got
given this thing for free so don't worry
if i use this in a build i'm not going
to be saying it was free because this is
a bit ridiculous to get given a 79 70
for free so we're gonna test this out
see if it actually works but another
thing on that note with the ddr2 memory
i got that for free because i pulled it
out of like servers that were going in
the tip and you know there was four of
them and then i was surprised because
they usually they have a registered
memory in there but when I pulled it out
one had like a q95 50 and then another
CPU which is really bad but they all had
consumer memory I'm just looking for the
other memory that I had I think it was
this stuff here so I pulled out the
HyperX memory and I also got this stuff
as well so this was the XMS ddr2 memory
from Corsair so that's another 8
gigabyte kit which means that I can do
kind of like another overclockable LGA
771 775 hybrid when I find another LGA
775 motherboards so that'll be cool when
that hits the channel but let's test out
this grabs card see if it works alright
so we've got this bad boy in here now
let's see if it works see if we can
actually get a signal out on this dual
ax 7970 that needs to eight pin
connectors so yeah if I do put this in a
build I will price this up because it's
ridiculous to get a free 7970 that
doesn't happen but with the ddr2 memory
that isn't ridiculous like there are
people chucking out old hardware just
left right and center because they
couldn't be bothered you know they
couldn't be bothered selling it it's
just not worth their time
to even sell that stuff so they just
chuck it out and there can be really
good parts in those old servers or even
just old computers so we're also later
on we'll go down the tip as well and
check out if they've got any pcs there
because I actually need some old cases
to do some old builds that I got coming
for the channel like maybe a fifty
dollar PC or something
this graph is go though it looks busted
man that's straight up that's why it's
free so there we go
free graphics card and it doesn't work
at all I am going to take off the cool
though
see if it is a reapplied thermal paste
that's hitting the conductors but I mean
the computers working the the yeah it's
just absolutely no signal coming out of
this thing so so we just pulled this
graphics card apart and now I don't know
if you guys heard but when I plugged it
up into the computer it was actually
recognizing everything but we weren't
getting a signal out of the port's and
I've had this happen in the past so
basically what happens if sometimes if
you run say you're running a five meter
cable here 5 min ago here then you run a
third 5 meter cable it can just put too
much of a strain on the outputs and then
you can actually blow out the outputs of
the card even though the grabs card is
still perfectly intact so what we're
gonna do is we're going to try just
clean up this grabs card first clean up
the pace and all that to also change the
bias since it's got a dual BIOS they
will try a different BIOS and then try
that HDMI port over like a 1 meter cable
or something and then see if it works it
doesn't work after that I'll then
finally try just a hair dryer over this
section here on very hot temperature see
if that can bring it back to life if not
the cards pretty much done is i'm really
not that i come i'm really bad at
soldiering so soldering on a new part
here would just be literally impossible
for me so the latest method for me
cleaning up these parts is to just use a
damp sponge and then followed by a
hairdryer on just like medium to light
temperature and then because this stuff
here in australia is like 8 bucks a
bottle which in japan the parts Lehman
was like a dollar a bottle and the
cheapest bright cleaners like nine
dollars a bottle so I'm gonna I'm
started using this method because
there's a lot cheaper so it's gonna
clean on this graphs card
let's do it
so now we've hooked up the gravis card
one more time and I've got the 750ti
under that just to give out a signal in
Windows and we can see there that the
display adapters the 7970 is just not
coming up at all so it wasn't actually
the outputs it was actually just the GPU
was busted in general those noises that
came out on camera before yeah just like
that one must have just been like that
stuff and actually not the gravity's
good so I made a mistake there yeah this
grabs car basically what we can do with
this is just pull off the cooler and all
the heat sinks and then yeah I've been
the PCB because that's pretty much
useless look at jaja he's happy after
now he's got a new coast off so I know
you guys like the jungle funk that was
junk but let's get on a song that's funk
this motherboard here we're gonna put
this together so we're gonna grab this
and we're gonna get a 78 50 and a Core 2
Duo and I've got 6 gigabytes of RAM here
so we're gonna start piecing together a
build for maybe like a $50 PC or
something because one of my friends just
gave me he has city had an old case
lying around his house I was like ok
I'll take that you know so got that for
nothing
there's also some other stuff there like
cable management stuff but we're gonna
start putting together a PC and we've
got here a cooler that I picked up in
Japan for 5 bucks now a lot of people
are asking me about the used parts like
how do you get the deals so cheap and
I'm gonna make a whole video dedicated
to use PC part hunting and what I do to
get deals but just as an example that's
the travel PC down there you know that
cooler that sis cooler for example I
picked that up with five bucks and that
was ages ago I didn't know what I was
gonna do with that cooler I just picked
it up cuz of the five bucks so the
biggest piece of advice I can give you
guys without going into a whole new
video is just broaden the horizon when
you see deals you pick them up because
you never know when you're gonna be able
to use that deal in the future and make
an awesome build but anyway this PC is
going to be something special hopefully
be around 50 bucks but we're gonna head
to the tip now and see what stuff we can
pick up from there so here it is guys
here's the new tech city 'mobile I
actually picked this up for about 4000
AUD what
to be like 3000 USD now it came with six
months Reggio and of course I'd
bargained the guy down like 500 bucks
now with cause I've been a massive fan
of cars since I've been a teenager like
you know 16 years old I've had like a
180sx a skyline to rx-7 FDS Liberty a
Toyota Soarer
and so yeah absolutely love cars and
this one I just picked it up as a beater
and see it's a 1.8 liter turbo I think
it's like the special edition it's
manual it's just awesome car to drive so
that's my car now but a lot of you guys
have been asking about my brother's Evo
so we're gonna take a quick look at that
now look at that key ring oh yeah
so here it is guys this is my brother's
evo 7 a lot of you have been asking
about this car it's a legit 11 second
car noble its modded to the hilt so
we'll go over some mods of this thing
but ironically my brother's actually
selling this thing at the moment for
about 25 G's Australian so if anyone's
keen on this thing I'll put a link in
the description below for it
but is absolute beast so taking a look
under the hood here this thing's got a H
gas GT 30 37 s turbo it's absolutely
massive it's also got a hatch guys can't
concise style cold air box with the apex
II pod filter installed in there also
272 Cosworth can't 880 CC precision
injectors and then let's move on the
inside over there's the epoxy power FC
with the hand controller that's tuning
the whole engine with a custom tune
you've also got the epoxy boost
controller there the a VCR and then on
the rims here we've got a road a grid a
teens with Brembo brakes all around
there's also carbon fibre and extensions
which make the car look so clean
well they do have some computers here
but I couldn't I'm actually not allowed
to take them nowadays so it's been crazy
I haven't been back here for a while so
looks like three computers in there that
I could take if they still giving them
away but apparently they don't let you
do that anymore so let's get out of here
so I just got home now and that place
was technically good except they just
wouldn't allow me to take any of the
stuff which is kind of shame so there
are a few other places on the Gold Coast
here which I'm gonna actually check out
in the next coming days and see if
they'll allow me to take some of those
pieces because I actually needed some
solder cables to splice into two of the
power supplies that I have here because
they don't have sight of cables on them
and another power supply still gotta fix
that as well that just needs a new fan
Kuzma had a fan that was just broken so
I've got to fix up those three power
supplies and then I'm gonna do a fifty
dollar budget build or should be around
about that and that'll be hitting the
channel pretty soon also we launched the
new tech lounge as well so I hope you
guys been enjoying that live show
there's gonna be another series that I'm
gonna launch as well pretty soon so
there's gonna be a lot more content
coming out because this is pretty much
now my full-time job so I've got to make
it work and on that note I do have a
patron page so I'll put that in the link
in the description below if you guys
want to even just support one dollar a
month or something that'll just go in
towards the channel towards upgrades and
even towards maybe employing someone to
do a bit of video work and get even more
content out on the channel for you guys
anyway that's about it for today if you
guys enjoyed this video then be sure to
hit that like button and let me know in
the comment section below what kind of
content do you want to see more on the
channel I'd love to hear your thoughts
and opinions as always and I'll catch
you in the next tag video very soon
peace out for now bye
that's my lunch now that I've got no job
okay so we're looking at this
motherboard it just doesn't work but I
think this is the problem here where the
actual bias goes in because when I was
messing around with it last year I just
like literally like took the bars out
put it in so many different times and
that these actual bottom two left pins
here especially they're just not making
contact with the bias chips so I was
just getting no signal at all I mean I
hope this motherboard works I mean this
motherboard has a soul and it's talking
to me it's like don't chuck me out Brian
and you know I don't want to Chuck yeah
baby
I want to keep you this is the
motherboard that began at all all the
used parts builds this was the first
part it's like sentimental to me one day
I'm gonna get this thing working again
and it's gonna be glorious so I'm not
talking yet just yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
