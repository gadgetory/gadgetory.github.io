in car this is their nvme they've got a
512 gigabyte flavor as well is a one
terabyte flavor right here on the desk
they sent over the 1 terabyte info
review and there's some good points
there's some bad points they're starting
off with one of the coolest things is
that if you've got an old PC like this
Dell Vostro that I got here on the desk
and it supports PCIe boot then you can
add in the nvme drive and get nvme
speeds on your older pc so things like
x79 and even some of those wanan boards
coming off of Aliexpress I can imagine
you could do some cool things with that
and considering the prices okay it's at
a decent price point they've got the 512
gigabyte version starting out at 149 USD
in Australia 239 AUD and then think of
the one terabyte coming in at 249 USD
and then in Australia 399 AUD so the one
terabyte version which is what we've got
here looks like it's better value in
terms of per gigabyte per dollar and it
also carries through with double the
terabytes written rating where the one
terabyte has sixteen hundred terabytes
written and then the 512 gigabyte
carries eight hundred terabytes written
they both carry a five-year limited
warranty and the both rated at 1.8
million hours mean time before failure
which is absolutely huge
I think that's longer than most humans
live but with that aside let's get
straight into the tests and see what is
good and bad about this drive
welcome back to tech yesterday and right
here we've got the Auris RGB AIC nvme
SSD so it's essentially a normal nvme
pcie 3.0 x4 solution except they've
added in 11 RGB LEDs
which is the first part I'm going to
critique about this piece of hardware is
that when I put it into my Z 370 system
and then loaded up the RGB fusion 2.0
software it didn't actually allow me to
change the RGB colors at all and on that
note it was actually changing the RAM
color on a different brand of memory
from Team Group so I was a little bit
surprised to see that happening but the
other additional software kit that
they've got the tool box that actually
worked pretty well it reads out your
temperatures supports things like trim
and shows you the status of your SSD
however as I've critiqued in the past
some of gigabytes software I'd like to
see them overhaul this integrate the two
into one so you could actually change
the colors of your SSDs RGB lighting
that would be great now speaking of the
LED lights they don't add really any
heat to the drive itself the whole power
consumption is around about 6 watts on
this SSD even with those RGB LED lights
on but when I was stress testing this
SSD the temperatures were really good
coming in at 31 degrees Celsius on the
surface and 33 degrees in the software
this is in a 24 degree ambient
controlled environment so the
temperatures are really good this is a
375 gram weighted hate sinks so it's
absolutely huge but looking underneath
the hood in terms of the hardware
they've put on this they've got a fire
sync controller believe it is the p55 0
1 to e 12 or otherwise known as the e 12
they've got two sk hynix 512 megabyte
ddr3 burst banks to make a total of one
gigabyte of ddr3 burst cache now in
terms of the actual NAND flash they're
using this is Toshiba 64 layer 3d TLC
nan it says on the banks themselves the
model numbers ta five nine six five five
aiv and all that comes on a black PCB I
also will mention the build quality does
feel very solid on this unit there's no
squeaky or loose parts but what about
the most important thing and that is the
speeds why I decided to run
three different tests compared against
the Samsung Evo that I have here the 970
as well as the Corsair mp5 10 both are
pretty value oriented solutions out
there on the market great for 4k video
editors who need really fast speeds over
the pcie 3.0 spec and what we saw here
with the one gigabyte AS SSD tests to
test burst speeds was that we're getting
very high read and write speeds
practically saturating the PCI gen3 x4
slot but moving down to the 4k read and
writes the random reading rights there
were a little bit underperforming on
both the read and the writes I tested
this a few times and I'm not entirely
sure what's going on there but the Q
depth test showed speeds that were very
good especially on the right side and
then the access times were mediocre and
this gave a total score of 6200 46
points moving over to the inputs and
outputs we had over 450,000 input
outputs per second on the read side and
then on the right side getting close to
that of 700,000 changing things over
however to the 10 gigabyte tests show
that read and write speeds were both
sustainable on sequential 's 4k random
reading writes were the same however the
queue depth did drop down both on the
read and writes and then the access
times were the same and the input and
outputs per second the maximum were
under 400,000 and then under that of
550,000 this time around though what
about one of the most important tests
that I run here with any storage
solution and that is the HD tune Pro
test this is the 100 gigabyte torture
test that I put practically every drive
that comes through here through and the
speed showed that after about 25
gigabytes of sustained writes the speeds
dropped substantially from those scores
that we saw in a SSD down to around
about 1,100 megabytes per second and
then the read speeds did sort of remain
consistent around 3,000 megabytes per
second however on two different tests
the read speeds did have some big dips
I'd say that have to be with maxing out
the controller on board so what we're
seeing here is something that's similar
to the other solutions on the market
like the Samsung and also the Corsair in
that they're pretty much using the same
TLC NAND flash maximizing what they can
out of it however the burst speeds are
great however it will drop down to
Stover that of a gigabyte per second
which is still actually really good if
you want to use it for 4k video editing
is a scratch drive or use it over a 10
gigabit per second home or business
networking solution it will provide
those speeds consistently but now of
course it's conclusion time with this
SSD what do I think of it and I think
for the money it's decent I mean the one
terabyte solution at 249 USD is pretty
good providing you can find it in stock
I could only find the 512 gigabyte
solution available on the market on
Amazon and in Australia I couldn't find
these for sale just yet I will update
the description when I get some more
news on that but in terms of its
performance it's pretty much mediocre I
guess I'd put it pretty much in the
middle of the field at least in terms of
what I've got here I mean Samsung are
kind of leading that in terms of
consistency and performance but they've
decided to add in the RGB bling as well
as provide a big heatsink to keep the
temperatures down and it does seem to
work but we have to go back to those
consistencies on the raid speeds in HD
tune Pro where they were dipping
substantially from time to time and then
we also have to look at the software
which is still a little bit buggy so if
those two things don't bother you and
you do want to get this and just whack
it in and get pretty good speeds then it
is going to deliver on that front but
it's not the best SSD I've seen but it's
certainly not the worst I've seen either
and with that aside I'll catch you guys
in another tech video very soon if you
enjoyed this review then be sure to hit

enjoyed the content your model and hit
that sub button ring the bell and I'll
catch you next time peace out for now
