just coming back to you guys today with
a review or unboxing and review of the
logitech MMO gaming mouse guys so this
is the japanese version so it's logical
here in Japan they couldn't get the
logitech name so as it was already taken
but as soon as we get this box guys it
really is really like sort of if you
know it put a real lot of time into
making this box and really looks good
but so let's first I've leave the specs
so it goes from 202 8200 DPI that is
massive that's the most DP I've ever
seen on a mouse before you know it's got
30 g sensor on it so it moves it
parently it moves pretty well so we're
going to actually test it later and put
it through a few little tests and see
how it goes thousand reports a second
guys so that's really good specs it
means it's a one millisecond response
time 130 grams and the cord is 15 grams
surprisingly they're putting a lot of
extra specs on this box well let's take
the mouse out anyway guys and have a
look and also is Bose different LED
lights straight away we have a look here
we've got the looks like the drivers
that we get with the you know just a
manual and I guess the warranty so
there's no drivers or anything just the
manual and warranty there and we open up
the box here and we shall try and get
this mess up
let's get this mess after you guys to
have a look so there's the unboxing hey
guys so we get it out of the box and
straight away that's what it looks like
so it's actually looks a little bit
smaller than what it looks like online
oh yeah when I looked at it online it
looked really really big but this
actually looks pretty like it's a good
size but it looks of it already so
anyway guys let's test this mouse out
let's put it on the mouse pad and test
it out ok guys so here is the mouse here
in the flesh so straight away unboxing
it guys you can see that it's got a
really nice long cable this cable is
actually longer than my g400s cable and
it's also braided guys so it's really
strong the cable looks really sturdy it
doesn't have a noise filter but I guess
if the cable is that thick and that good
quality I guess it doesn't need one but
anyway guys let's have a look at the
mouse itself so when I did unbox it it
had come with this annoying sticky wrap
all over it but I guess it's kind of a
you know a feeling to make sure you know
you're getting a new brand new Mouse so
that is something to look out for if it
doesn't have that on means someone's
probably already used your mouse now
looking at this mouse guys this is on a
razer goliathus control edition mousepad
now straight away the mouse feels
awesome like I you know the shape is a
lot it's different it is a lot different
I mean but I noticed with this mouse
guys you can grip it either two ways I
noticed you can still do the classical
grip the claw grip and it still feels
really good so filling this mouse around
you know it is it feels really good even
if your cloak of it if you use the
logitech recommended group which is that
group it's still it feels different so
I'm going to have to actually get used
to that so I will it will take some time
for me to get used to that new group
that in the meantime I'd probably be
doing just this grip and it still feels
absolutely fine so really good mouse
there guys I wouldn't worry too much of
your thinking about worrying about this
button I wouldn't worry too much it's
not like it's sort of i think is it as
an option so if you want to use it you
can if you don't you don't have to you
can still claw grip fine like that now
let's actually look at the buttons here
so
the main reason I got this mouse was
because of these buttons and yes they do
change color looks really cool so as you
can see it's cycling through the colors
and just clicking them straight away you
can see ya there really they're really
nice to click so they're really
accessible guys it's something you can
really actually and they're marked out
really well so they're grooved in so
like they're grooved sort of inverted
inverted lee grooved which means that
you can identify each button really easy
so that is something that is something
that will be a great feature for me
especially while I'm playing World of
Warcraft so this mouse guys all over all
it feels so let's look on the build
quality they feel if I grab it and try
and strangle it it's just made it's a
really well well-designed Mouse feels
really good logitech's grip on it this
grip feels unreal there's only a little
bit of gloss here which is around the
areas and you don't really touch that
anyway the buttons that clicked on the
buttons feel a little bit soft for some
reason these button the clicks on and
feel a little bit soft same with the
left and the right click if feel they do
feel a little bit soft up and the G
shift as well so these buttons here they
feel a little bit softer as compared to
mine logitech g400 which I believe has
the best left and right click that I've
ever felt on announce it just the click
on the G 400 is really good and I still
think it's got the best left and right
click so that's the G 400 there and as
you can see probably for a quick size
comparison you can see there that the
g400 is actually taller but this is a
little bit wider so if you got big hands
it's not going to bother you at all both
mounts are going to be really good and
have one for FPS and one for MO and
obviously i got my g3 as well for RTS
and i am a real big fan of logitech
mouse as guys i reckon they they just
make really especially in japan razor
Mouse's are a lot more expensive than
they are in japan like compared to
logitech in america they're probably
similar similar price so there's not
much big of a difference for here you
know logitech
a lot more better value so you know the
build quality on logitech mouse mice is
just unreal there are always good build
quality and they always come to
three-year warranty to something to
remember about this mouse now this
mounts you guys let's look at the scroll
wheel quickly this scroll wheel feels
really good well like I it's a different
feel to other scroll wheels and it just
feels really are like sort of it's a
really smooth scroll but it's also got
that real good feedback on it so I don't
know if you can hear it but it it's
smooth to change but you also know every
time you're changing it so I must have
it's got a lot of things that I will
personally take probably another week
Tory to get used to it but it feels
everything feels really solid on this
mouse you know the left click and the
right click feel like they're sort of
designed to be long our sort of their
bit softer than the g four hundred the
clicks on it but I guess that's designed
for long hours of gaming so really
designed to just you know be comfortable
think this mouse is and overall gripping
it it just feels really good so I do
like the weight on it and one point I
will mention is that these teflon-coated
feet here there's two of them and
basically they're really they glide
extremely well like this is a control
edition mousepad this thing is just
gliding so compared to the g four
hundred this mouse you know even though
it's heavier it just glides really easy
like it's a probably you know the Teflon
feet are really smooth on this mouse
something to know so these two buttons
for changing the DPI on the fly if you
want to change your dpi wait yeah so
that's yeah there's the DPI just going
berserk oh but that you know you can
change the DPI all the way up to eight
thousand two hundred which gets
ridiculous so I'll have to research this
a little bit more but yet you've
definitely got your dpi changing
switches here and the clicks on them
feel pretty solid so nothing to worry
about there now the click on the mouse
wheel is a little bit unstable because
when you click this mouse wheel it's
sort of your scrolling as well
clicking it so probably not one of the
buttons that I will rely on because of
the fact that it will scroll as well the
scroll is definitely reliable though
that the scroll itself just click on
it's a little bit can see myself
clicking that quickly and scrolling up
to so have to be careful with that and
yeah so overall in a nutshell guys this
has got a lot of buttons you know how
would I compared it to a razer naga i
don't know what happened try to razer
naga yet but definitely guys this I can
see myself using this in MMO and
definitely with an extra you know 12 odd
buttons on the side it's going to help
me with my you know and a GF shift
button to it's going to help me out a
lot so lastly i'm just going to check
the sensor guy so i'll try and you know
people have been complaining that the
census sort of they have this weird bug
where they just move up or something i'm
just going to try and spaz it out now
but check it out and absolutely no
spazzing lee the sensor is really good
on this so you know I can't spaz this
sensor out so you know try max DPI but
yeah I can't spaz this sensor out of all
so many games it might be a different
thing but yeah the sensor on it is
really good too so it's actually a laser
sensor guys it's important to remember
that too so it's actually a high quality
laser sensor as opposed to an optical
sensor so I do prefer the laser sensors
but obviously on a good mousepad it does
not really matter it's just I do prefer
to have a laser mouse just to know that
you're always you know if there's a
little bit of dirt on your mouse pad as
opposed to an optical it could affect
you at a crucial time so just a little
little you know point there but that's
why I do love my laser mouse over the
optical yeah aight guys i hope this
review has helped you out today and if
you've got any questions leave in the
comments section below and i'll get back
to as soon as I can and of course if you
