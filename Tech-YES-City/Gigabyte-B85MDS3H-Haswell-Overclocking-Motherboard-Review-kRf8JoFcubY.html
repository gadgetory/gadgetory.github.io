the three products that I recently put
in my budget bill and that is the
gigabyte be 85m ds3 H
welcome back to take it city this is the
rain easy coming back to you guys today
with a review of the B 85m ds3 H from
gigabyte now this motherboard is
recently become very popular and the
main reason for that is because gigabyte
have released a UEFI bios which allows
you to overclock overclockable para
Haswell CPUs however although this board
will allow you to overclock a46 70k at
4690k for 770 km 4790k it mainly comes
with the I mean the main you extract the
most value for money out of this
motherboard when you couple it with a 30
to 58 and there's a few reasons for this
the first reason is that the motherboard
itself actually has a voltage limit of
1.2 volts and the second reason for this
is that at that 1.2 voltage limit you
can safely use the stock heatsink with a
32:58 and so it's kind of like you're
getting the best of both weally
extracting the best value for money out
of both products when you couple them
together so anyway let's look at the
motherboard itself today we're just
going to be looking at the motherboard
itself I'll be talking about the
experience that I had with this
motherboard I'll be talking about the
features of this motherboard and giving
giving this thing an overall huge high
recommendation so let's get on with it
so when we look at the motherboard
itself it comes packaged just like any
other motherboard I mean it comes
packaged pretty well it could take a
beading and shipping it comes with two
side of three cables it also comes with
an input/output shield and it also comes
with a user manual which is actually
very easy to read now picking up this
motherboard for the first time I was
impressed it's been a while since I've
had a gigabyte motherboard come through
here and honestly when I picked it up it
was just like yeah you're getting that
solid gigabyte feel even with a budget
motherboard like the B 85 and if the
motherboard still feels solid all the
solder connections feel solid the RAM
slot everything just feels solid and
well built with the gigabyte motherboard
also the black on the front and the rear
looks really good as well it's a nice
jet black if you guys are thinking about
it's not a brown if you guys are worried
about that also let's look at the
motherboard itself and what it features
looking at the main part itself it looks
like it features a four
to phase power design it actually
doesn't say on the specs spec sheet but
that's what I believe it is this is
ample fine if you're going to overclock
a 32:58
now you also this motherboard you get a
two four pin CPU connectors so we'll it
will give a more solid power delivery
than a H 81 and motherboard otherwise
would so keep that in mind this is the
main reason why I'm recommending this
motherboard over H 81 MSI just believe
it's a more solid motherboard it's a
more stable motherboard for the job now
also with this motherboard as well
you're getting four Ram slots as well
which supports up to 32 gigabytes of RAM
so it does give you a bit of upgrade
ability if you want to put in say in the
future if you want to put 16 gigabytes
of RAM in and put in a 4 770 K or
something like that this motherboard
will allow you to do that which is
actually really impressive now another
impressive feature about this
motherboard is it features dual BIOS as
well so you're getting a dual BIOS on a
55 while I paid $55 for a $55
motherboard which is really damn
impressive in my opinion like I was
surprised because if you guys are doing
it if you're flashing the BIOS and in
some freak accident happens like the
power cuts out while you're flashing a
BIOS if you only have a single boss on
board essentially your motherboard will
be bricked if you have the dual blast
you can recover the boss that you had
before
and you can try and flash it again so I
do like the dual blast implementation
especially on $55 motherboard now
looking at the heatsink itself is got a
heatsink on the South Bridge it doesn't
feature a heatsink
on the North Bridge which is unfortunate
but again due to the price I really
can't say that is a negative because I
can't expect them to put so many things
in on a budget motherboard looking at
the features of the motherboard itself
it has fair support for for front panel
USB connections as support also for two
front panel USB 3 connections it also
has front audio out panel there for your
power pins as well your normal things
now looking at the rear of the
motherboard you get four USB to ports
you also get two USB 3 ports on the rear
ps2 port HDMI out a Realtek ni C which
is probably the only thing
I would protect about this motherboard
however again with the price in mind I
can't expect them to put a more
expensive in a/c on board you also get
the real tech alc889a mean considering
it comes with a 55 dollar motherboard
very decent for the money I mean I
tested this with my headphones
it sounds pretty decent I mean I tested
the microphone as well it's also got
support for noise removal so if you're
playing video games you can just hit
that noise removal and you're good to go
so we've done the actual review now of
the product let's talk about the BIOS
and look what you get so as soon as you
get this motherboard you essentially can
couple it and it will work with a 32 58
regardless of how old the boss is I'm
not sure about the 4690k and for 790 K
so if you're going to get that CPU and
coupled with this motherboard which I I
mean it's not that high of a
recommendation due to the 1.5 1.2 volt
women but if you're going to do that
then please research it may need the
bass update before you put those CPUs in
with this motherboard however this model
this CPU will work straight out of the
box with any bias implementation on this
motherboard however as soon as you get
this motherboard you will want to update
the BIOS and that is because that'll
allow you to overclock the 32:58 so once
you do that essentially you can pretty
much put the voltage up to 1.2 volts
which is how I'd recommend overclocking
this thing put it up to 1.2 volts and
then see how high of a clock speed you
can get with your CPU the 32:58 there's
also some other things you may want to
do I raise the T TDP limit as well the
max wattage limit just so it didn't
become an object in overclocking this
thing now you're probably wondering why
is there a 1.2 volt limit on the B 85
and I believe that's just simply to
protect the motherboard and also to
protect you the users from frying the
motherboard because if you fry a
motherboard you have the potential to
damage not just the motherboard but
pretty much every component in your
system so keep that in mind I do agree
with the 1.2 volt limit I do believe
it's a good safety measure put in place
set especially when we consider that
these motherboards were never in
tended for overclocking so I like the
fact that this motherboard does
overclock this CPU and it does overclock
it very well I mean I ran a 24 hour
stress test on UniGene Valley and also
ran a two-hour stress test on prime95
in the dead heat of summer we're talking
30 degrees plus this multiple dis C for
you they held up absolutely fine so I
was pretty much blown away by how good
the value-for-money was when you look at
this motherboard it handled this Pentium
absolutely fine now another thing you
guys are probably wondering well why did
you just use the heatsink so when I
fetch and when I talked about my build
in my blog a few few days ago I was
talking about mean just using the stock
heatsink fan with a 32:58 and again the
big reason for that is the 1.2 volt
limit on this motherboard I will I
probably will be putting it in my z87
motherboard and seeing how high it goes
if you guys want to see it on my Fri it
who knows make a good video on that but
in the meantime the 1.2 volt limit means
that essentially this CPU will be fine
with the stock heatsink fan because if
it can't go over 1.2 volt and it's
hitting 90 degrees max in the dead heat
of summer on prime95 then there is no
need to get an aftermarket heat sink fan
with this CPU that's just my opinion if
it had a 1.3 volt limit then yeah you
might be able to get it to 4.6 gig 4.5
gig and then you might need that
aftermarket CPU cooler but with the 1.2
volt limit on this motherboard 4.2 gigs
and the stock heatsink
it's such good synergy such good value
for money you can save that extra money
put it towards a GTX 760 or 750ti RS r9
270 whichever you want to go with and it
will make for one hell of a gaming
machine now these two in closing I'm
going to talk about these two together
they are really good they I mean
honestly this is like one of the best
value for money motherboards I have seen
in a long time
it just handles the Pentium 32:58 so
well handles the motherboard I mean
handles the GTX 760 so well it doesn't
get hot just absolutely phenomenal
experience
this motherboard I can highly recommend
$55 if you are thinking about getting
with the 32:58
I am going to be bringing out an
overclocking 32:58 guide for this
motherboard as well so stay tuned for
that okay so before I go and edit this
video for you guys I will add one more
point and that is that the B 85m
actually can enter the c 1e enhanced
hold site on the CPU even though it does
say that the voltage is fixed at 1.2
volts when I overclocked it I actually
checked with a kilowatt meter and the
wattage or the power consumption was
running exactly pretty much identically
the same as when it was on the auto
settings and the voltage was scaling
down to 0.7 volts so I don't know about
other brands like the Zeus H 81m watt
the msi but the gigabyte b85 this
motherboard does indeed allow the cpu to
enter the seeonee enhanced whole state
when you overclock it even though it
says that the CPU is still running at
1.2 volts
I thought that was pretty cool anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this review if you
did please give it a thumbs up and I
will catch you guys very soon with the
Pentium 32:58 review if you have any
questions please leave a comment in the
comment section below and I'll get back
to you guys as soon as I can and yeah
can't wait to give you guys the video on
the 32:58 anyway piece it up now this is
