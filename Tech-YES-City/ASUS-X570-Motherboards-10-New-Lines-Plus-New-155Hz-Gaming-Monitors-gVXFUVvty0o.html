booth here for Computex 2019,
and they have 10 new X570
motherboards on display.
And, we're gonna be covering
all that plus some monitors,
plus a heap of other new
things that are really cool.
They got their ProArt
series and a lot of things.
But, you guys wanna know
about the motherboards,
so we're gonna start from
the top to the bottom,
and this is gonna be quite a long one,
because there's so many
details to go through.
Starting off from the top to the bottom,
we have the ROG Crosshair VIII Formula
with 16 Power Stages, and
also has an EK Water Block
over the VRM for custom water cooling,
and on top of that,
the bottom half is cooled with a heat sink
with an OLED display across
the top to the bottom.
I mean the--
This thing looks absolutely
gorgeous in person.
Of course, the pricing is
still to be determined,
though that will come out
closer to the release date
of the Ryzen 3000 series chips.
In terms of availability,
I do hear around from all
the board partners, you
can expect these boards
to be released about a week
before those CPUs go on sale.
Now, other things they have
included is 5G Aquantia LAN
on this board, as well
as all metal shielding
in all the 8-pin areas.
This is across all the X570 boards,
and you get WiFi 6 included,
and an integrated IO shield.
Now, only two of the models
don't have integrated IO shields.
I will point them out as we go along,
but moving beside that is
the Crosshair ROG VIII Hero
with 2.5G Realtek, so they're stepping it
down from 5G to 2.5G.
It's also got WiFi 6, and the
same VRM with 16 Power Stages,
which also on this VRM
phase features no driver
separated from the MOSFET.
The driver's actually in the MOSFET,
which makes for better
efficiency and lower latency.
You also got for M.2
drive support PCI 4x4.
You get two of those on pretty much every
single board here throughout the lineup,
except the ITX versions.
Now, for you Mini-ITX lovers out there,
they've got the X570 I Gaming.
This features 10 Power Stages, WiFi 6,
however in this case,
you will need to mount
the IO shield that will come included,
but the design does look pretty cool.
They're featuring mesh over
this little Mini-ITX solution,
and they've integrated
the heat sink fan for
the PCiE Gen 4 on the chipset over to
the left hand side of the board.
And then, if you want a little bit more
but you still want a
small DTX form factor,
then they've got the
Crosshair VIII Impact.
Still has 10 Power Stages,
and the orientation of
the Power Stages are slightly different,
and so you also the support
with that orientation,
freeing up some space another
slot for a SO-DIMM lane.
They can support two NVMe drivers
with a PCiE Gen 4x slot.
Now, also on this board
they have a separate section
for the audio, which
features the SupremeFX S1220.
I have tested the FX
audio on the motherboards
in the past, and it is really good,
but on top of that, you
are getting the feature set
for the USB type-C out to
go to your front panel.
Now, moving down through
the ROG X570 boards,
we have the E Gaming.
This features AX 6 WiFi 2.5 gig NIC,
as well as 16 Power Stages.
It takes away the OLED,
but also does include
some RPG display still
included for the bling.
Now, the memory does have one phase,
and this is an important
difference between
these ROG boards and also
the top tier ROG boards,
is that they have two phases
supporting for the memory,
but again, still able
to absolutely be fine
for enthusiast overclockers
on air and water.
Those real top tier boards that you see,
they're mainly for LN2O overclocking,
or for someone who just
wants the absolute best.
And then, besides that
we got the ROG X570-F,
which again features
still 16 Power Stages,
but takes away the WiFi 6, but includes
a 1 gigabit Intel NIC
instead of the 2.5G solution.
Now, another thing about
the X570 ROG boards
is that all of them
come with USB Flashback.
Essentially, you won't
need RAM or a CPU installed
in order to update your BIOS,
which in the future if
there's new CPUs coming out
then you don't have to worry about
having the newer gen CPU, buying that
and not supporting that particular CPU.
But, that's only six
motherboards out the way.
We still got another four to cover,
and two of these are right beside me here.
These are the TUF GAMING series.
This is the X570-Plus WiFi
and just the X570-Plus.
Now, you do get two
NVMe PCiE Gen 4x4 slots,
one of those featuring a heat shield
to help drop the temperatures
down on the NVMe drive.
All the chipset's heat sinks here as well
do have a fan, whether it's
more obvious or not obvious,
but of course the WiFi
versus the non-WiFi edition,
you're just simply adding
those extra features in.
And then, moving on into
the more value-orientated
options here for the X570 boards
is their Pro and P series.
The Pro has 14 Power
Stages similar to the TUF,
and also features PCiE Gen 4x4.
You get one of those with a heat sink
and no integrated IO shield,
just like the TUF GAMING series.
Then, the last in the line is the X570-P,
still has 12 Power Stages
and it's the cheapest
X570 board coming from Asus here,
so they are taking care of
you on the VRM side of things,
but there is an NVMe slot,
but there are no heat shields
for those NVMe drives,
so they are pretty much
cutting down on everything,
except the VRM to give
you guys solid overclocks
and a great experience
that you would expect
from using that Asus BIOS and getting
all the overclocks you'd
want on even a 12 core.
So now, just like the motherboards,
we've got a heap of different
monitors to get through.
This is the PG27UQX,
144Hz, HDR1000, 4k monitor
with 576 local backlit zones.
Now, this does support
Nvidia's G-Sync technology
but you will need some serious grunt
to power this monitor properly.
I'd be thinking somewhere in the lines of
two RTX 2080 Tis, since
it's of course 4k, 144Hz.
But, checking this thing
out, it does feature
Mini LEDs, which is a
new technology coming in
that Asus is really going hard on,
and they're putting on
top of that a QLED layer,
so you're getting the best
colors coming through,
coupled with an IPS screen.
This thing looks absolutely
gorgeous in person.
Now, in terms of pricing and release dates
that's still to be determined
but I do hear this thing
is very close to release.
Next up here, we have the XG438Q.
This is a large size gaming display,
FreeSync 2, HDR600, 120Hz, VA panel,
and of course it's 43 inches big,
so you will need a lot of grunt,
just like the monitor behind
me to power this thing
if you want to get it.
It is slated for a quarter three release.
The pricing is still to be determined,
though I hear it's not gonna
come in that too expensive,
like you can expect to see this thing
probably under 1500 dollars.
Now, continuing on with monitors,
we got the Asus TUF GAMING
VG27AQ and also the 32VQ.
Both of these feature a
really high refresh rates.
The 32-inch having 144Hz VA panel.
Now, they've got ELMB
with FreeSync enabled
at the same time, which
is pretty much a first
for the monitor industry.
That means you can change refresh rates,
but still have that ultra low motion blur
with the backlight flicking through.
Now, this extends to
the same 27-inch model,
except that's got a 155Hz IPS panel.
So, a little bit smaller but in my opinion
does look a little bit
better that the 32-inch.
In terms of release dates and pricing,
the pricing's still TBD,
but the release dates are very close,
so you can expect that
out next month some time.
Now, last up in the line of
monitors is their flagships,
essentially, which don't have a whole lot
to do with gaming.
This is the ProArt
series, and in particular
we're talking about the PA32UCX,
which has Thunderbolt support,
1200 nits of CCD brightness,
10 bit, HDR 4k, IPS, and
100% sRBG color accuracy
with 1152 backlit zones,
and it's little brother
the PA27UCX has 576 zones,
HDR 10, and 1000 nits of CCD brightness.
In terms of the pricing,
it's still in the air.
They don't give me any
rough figures really
to work with either, but you can expect
these monitors to come
out in quarter three.
And now, last up in the
lineup is peripherals,
so we'll talk about their
new electrostatic headsets,
but they also have some
new power supplies,
the Strix 600 and 750 watt
gold-rated power supplies.
These are still to be determined
in terms of release dates and pricing,
but they are stepping it
down from their Thor series
making things more affordable.
But, in terms of a headset,
they have what's called
the Theta, and this is
electrostatic on the highs,
and dynamic speakers for the lows.
So, the headset does feature
two individual speakers inside,
and this is said to give you better bass,
as well as giving you a
clearer clarity on mid-range,
and also the higher vocals.
And, another headset they got
as well is the ROG Theta 7.1,
which is a true 7.1 gaming
headset with speakers all out
to give you that proper surround sound.
And, on this particular headset,
they do have a microphone
that uses AI to actively
cancel out repetitive noises
that aren't that of a human voice.
I did try this in motion, and
it actually works pretty well.
I was quite surprised, but in terms of
release dates and pricing, you should see
at the end of July, the Theta
electric being released,
and then September will
be when the Theta 7.1
should come to market.
As for one of the most underrated
products here on display,
I thought this was pretty cool.
This is the ROG Strix Arion,
and it's call the S1C,
and it's got speeds up to
1000 megabytes per second.
But, this is an external
NVMe add-in solution.
So, you can get your own
NVMe card, add it in,
and then on the mobile
you can plug it into a USB
that supports high speeds,
and then you're good to go
with really fast transfers.
I'm hoping to get one of these in,
so when I do my file transfers
over USB 3.2 for example,
I can then test out the
speeds properly for you guys.
In terms of release date and pricing,
it is quarter three but the pricing
is still to be determined.
And, with that aside
guys, I'm gonna quickly
snip over to a very
special snippet right now
that is actually incredible.
Before we close out this video however,
there is something that I
have been privileged to see,
and I never even knew it existed.
This is the only prototype in existence.
This is a GTX 780 Ti Mars,
and this was so close to--
(thriller music)
And, that about wraps things
up for the Asus ROG booth,
and also their other
booths that they have here
for Computex 2019.
