Philips 32 8 m6 which is a curved
monitor with 1800 curvature and comes in
in Australia at 649 Aussie dollars if
you're in America or in the UK I
currently can't find at the sale it may
be under a different alias I'm not too
sure but I will update the description
below when I learn more on this but
today we're gonna be going through the
most important figures 1440p panel 31
and a half inches of diagonal screen 16
by 9 and also supports a hundred and
forty four Hertz refresh rate as well as
supporting free sync and also adaptive
sync out of the box so you will need an
AMD graphics card that will for freesync
support look that aside get your knives
and forks out because we're gonna start
eating those meat and potatoes right
after the intro
welcome back to tech yes City now
Phillips our advertising on the box for
milliseconds great array response times
so we had to test this for different
modes off fast faster and fastest
essentially overdrive the UFO tests
showed that both the faster and faster
settings were pretty good at 144 Hertz
as for the fast and the off modes I do
not recommend them though starting with
off this was transitioning over 15 plus
milliseconds which made three different
images at once being displayed on the
same frame this will confuse your eyes
make no mistake about it fast on the
other hand did help drop this though we
still had transitioning over to frames
where at 144 Hertz the average frame
transition between a frame is around 7
milliseconds thousand divided 144 so
ideally we want response times that are
faster than this in a perfect world
under half of this is optimal
so around 3 to 4 milliseconds of course
one millisecond being the best but
you're not going to get that on a VA
panel which is what this features right
here it also has 1800 R curvature and
quantum dot technology so that is
helping bring out the Reds and also the
Greens as opposed to the Blues but
faster however back to the response
times this provided eight to nine
milliseconds of average response time
still however slightly transitioning
over to images in the same frame' and
then we go into fastest which provided a
very playable 5 to 6 milliseconds
transitions on greater greys and also
dark Gray's though the whites were still
slightly lacking a little bit but
optimal and csgo regardless now there is
an input lag on and off option which
ironically did not just help with the
input lag so you want to leave it on of
course but also when it was turned off
it made the pixel response times go
crazy and noticeably bad the 1000 FPS
camera showed this as well where we got
slower response times as well as slower
input lag so go figure it's not just the
actual response time settings but it's
also the input lag settings so there
with it on we had the best frame coming
in at nine milliseconds total input lag
on the system very very impressive and
then averaging out to about 15 to 16
milliseconds with the worst frame coming
in at 24 milliseconds again this is the
total system input lag and these are
very very impressed
numbers scoring up there with some of
the other monitors without around here
like the view Sonics and the azusa's so
I'd guess anywhere from zero to ten
milliseconds with low input lag option
switched on would be realistic for this
monitor though basically regards to
response times and input lag I think
there are only two options for this
monitor if you are gaming and that is
the low input lag option switched on
from the monitor OSD
as well as 144 Hertz enabled with either
the faster or the fastest setting for
the pixel response times me personally I
prefer the fastest setting playing csgo
for a little while did make this the
most comfortable setting for my eyes
also at 144 Hertz however when I did
drop it down to 60 Hertz there was some
very noticeable overdrive kicking in
here artifacting and they were huge I
mean you could see the blacks clearly
popping out where they shouldn't be so
basically I don't recommend playing
games on this monitor with anything by
144 Hertz now also going through the OSD
it's very clearly laid out very simple
to use one button with a directional
setting like a d-pad and you can access
everything very quickly brightness
settings as well as contrast as well as
manual color control white balance and
also a low blue light mode which has
three different settings
besides officer four in total to enable
low blue light if you're using it at
night however me personally I still
prefer flux from the actual software
itself because that's automatically
controlled very quickly mentioning power
consumption with this monitor we had
about 40 watts at 160 ccd brightness and
then a max brightness setting of a
hundred we had about 60 watts usage now
with the LEDs turned on or off
there was about a 2 watt difference as
well there speaking of brightness they
advertised 400 CCD on the box we were
getting about 250 in the real world with
this thing calibrated at srgb setting
with max brightness on 147 setting gave
us a hundred and sixty CCD which is what
I prefer personally and then the white
uniformity was really good across this
whole panel the grays and the dark
Gray's as well were pretty good but on
the whites there was a slight shift to
the right of the panel and then the
backlight bleed wasn't noticeable there
was no visible cross-hatching as well
when we pulled up an orange backdrop now
quickly continuing over with color
balance and the monitor itself there is
different modes they've got FPS and a
few other preset modes however I would
like to see a cinema mode with higher
saturated colors lower gamma setting and
also a dedicated image editing mode as
well say for instance turning the srgb
on with the brightness of 160 ccd there
was pretty plain settings the FPS being
good for FPS games where ups the gamma
and also ups the blue as well and the
color balance so you can see shadows
easily but besides that it was lacking a
few options in the preset menu but also
speaking of the color balance itself it
was very accurate out of the box I'm
surprised this thing was really as close
as it gets to a calibrated monitor
without Philips themselves calibrating
this out of the factory it was so close
in fact that only really the darker
tones were slightly off all the colors
were really accurate the mids and the
high keys were pretty much spot-on as
well so very impressive job if you're
into gaming and doing video editing and
you only can afford one Monda this might
be the monitor to consider but let's
move on now with some extra things on
this monitor first of all the speakers
as stereo speakers and surprisingly the
audio coming out of these speakers is
very good so good to the point where if
you are predominantly a headphone user
but you wanted backup speakers these
would definitely do the job of course
it's a little bit tinny due to it not
having a subwoofer but the mids are
definitely present and they do give out
an enjoyable experience both gaming and
listening to music and the volume is
great if you're just sitting at a normal
80 centimeter position from the monitor
now also they advertise flicker free
when I was testing up to eight thousand
Hertz on the camera it didn't show any
flicker at all and there's an ambient
lighting under the monitor itself which
you can set to a static color if you
wish to or if you leave it on auto it
will match the colors on the desktop
itself and then change the lighting to
that it's also got different brightness
settings to choose from too also before
we get on to that conclusion little
intricate there is a smart contrast
setting and also a pixel orbiting
setting when I turn these on I didn't
notice a whole lot of difference viewing
angles on the both vertical and
horizontal
angles were phenomenal so it is a really
good upgrade from a TN panel and then of
course the colors out of the box are
pretty solid though out of the box you
will want to put this on low input lag
mode and set it to srgb and drop the
brightness down to around 45 to 55 in my
opinion those are little nitpicks with
this monitor we've got big LEDs on the
bottom I think they're 5050 and they're
diffused five on each side they do
flicker and they do look a little bit
obvious I would like to see them to fuse
these LEDs a bit more as well as the
coating on the monitor itself it is a
tad bit stronger than what I'm used to
so I'm used to more of a little bit
slightly semi-gloss finish this is a
little bit more on the side of a matte
finish to a gloss finish so your mileage
may vary of course it blocks out the Sun
very well but there's also no ultra low
motion blur setting and also HDR which
has an auto setting and when we turn
this on in Windows it just looks bad on
everything I have tested other monitors
in the past where HDR did look good
depending on the scenario but I turned
it on in this and everything's just
washed out even on demos on YouTube and
games it just looks bad in general so I
recommend just turning HDR off on this
monitor in general I would like to see a
demonstration where it actually works
better than the original picture that
you're getting out of this monitor
anyway here we are now at conclusion
time this monitor right here phenomenal
build quality the stand is very high
quality looks very modern it's also got
height adjustment as well and tilt but
it doesn't have both horizontal nor
vertical swivel so that is something I
would like to see especially the
horizontal swivel but it does have a lot
of input options you've got SVGA you've
also got two display ports both
supporting 1.1 and 1.2 standard and a
HDMI 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 in so 5 display
inputs in total and that leaves us at
the price range now 649 Australian
dollars that's where you can currently
pick this thing up for and at this price
it packs a lot of value they're trying
to differ themselves by offering some
ambient lighting on the bottom but in
terms of the make itself and the
overdrive settings they've done a
phenomenal job I like
this monitor probably the best out of
all the 32 inch 144 hertz panels I've
tested the fastest setting at 144 Hertz
low input lag mode is really good not to
mention the speakers on board are really
solid as well will give out a great
sound and then the picture itself is
beautiful as well so Philips have done a
great job and this is the first Philips
monitor I've had come through in review
so ultimately I can recommend this thing
I don't know when it'll come out in the
US or the UK but I will update the
description once I have more information
but besides that I hope you guys enjoyed
this review if you didn't be sure to hit
that like button and also if you try to
fill this monitor before let us know in
the comments what you thought of it do
you think it was worth the money if not
let us know why not if so let us know
why lover your thoughts and opinions as
always and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
