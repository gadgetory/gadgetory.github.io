get on with an episode of tech talk
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
tech talk episode 33 and today we're
going to talking about like a mass
miscellaneous there's a lot of different
things to talk about so anyways we'll
get on to the first topic and that is
steam and valve investors paid mods
fiasco basically they wanted to
introduce the option to have paid mods
where the developer of the mod only got
twenty five percent of the money being
paid for the mod that twenty five
percent of the revenue and that's
disgusting like straight away I'm going
to say this is what people were probably
getting pissed off about was not the
fact that they were introducing the
option to have paid mods and I think
it's something that could work I think
adding things like a donation button I
think that could work and I think that's
something that valve needs to consider
but when they come out and say hey the
mod the person who creates this mod is
only getting one dollar of every four
dollars it's kind of like hey we're sick
of all this corporate greed nowadays and
you guys want to pay the person making
the content next to nothing like what
what are you kidding me so anyway this
is what I think people got pissed off
about as not just so that they're
introducing the options to have paid
mods is that they're just trying to take
as much money as they can that's how I
saw it anyway 75 seven the money goes to
best or and valve I mean it's just like
yeah I really don't I didn't like that
revenue sharing model I think that's
what needed to be or needed a lot more
thought when implementing so anyway
they've apparently they've scrapped it
now Gabe said not we've had so many
complaints now that we're going to scrap
this and we're going to leave mods for
free and I mean in ways like I agree
with it right counter-strike and dota
were fantastic mods mods are great for
the gaming community the pc gaming
community what also is great for the pc
gaming community that is that if someone
wants to try and quit their day job and
start making mods for a living so they
made a mod and a lot of people enjoyed
it and they're like hey i want to get
paid for this I'll start making a really
good mod they could also get paid good
money for that not twenty five percent
so I think they need to rethink the
revenue sharing model if they want to
introduce paid mods just
putting that out there valve and steam
ambassador but apparently from what I
gather it wasn't actually valve that
introduced the 75 25 percent model I
think beste from what I gather I mean I
don't have any concrete information but
from what I gather it was actually
Bethesda I didn't even know how to
pronounce it sorry that wanted to
introduce the 75 25 percent model so in
ways I mean if that's the case Gabe
should say that it'll save him a bit of
face so I mean anyway anyway let's get
on to the next piece of news this is the
whole gigabyte fiasco and I'm kind of
shocked as to why I didn't know about
this sooner but it wasn't until some of
my viewers pointed me in this direction
and say hey what's going on with the b85
motherboards from gigabyte you're
recommending him but they look different
to the one that you recommended and I
was like what and so I read this article
this is over five months old and I don't
know why this hasn't gained enough
attention but it's absolutely disgusting
I think this is worse than the nvidia
fiasco at least with the gtx 970 you got
a product that worked well for the money
this time around you're getting such a
downgrade in performance that your CPU
will actually throttle a normal I seven
out of the box will actually throttle on
the revision to motherboard and it
doesn't throttle on the revision 1 so
Lutz is looking at the pictures here
I'll put the article in description
below the one gigabyte have done is
they've released a revision 2 of this
motherboard and they've cut the vrm down
so much you can see it in the pictures
here half the MOSFETs not only that
we've got one less choke we've got less
caps on there and you've also got weaker
components on that regard as well so
you're getting essentially like a third
of the vrm look here we've got 52 m
MOSFETs as opposed to 69 am all set so
you essentially you're getting like a
third of the vrm that you were getting
with the previous revision really
disgusting not only that apparently on
the box they're advertising it as a dual
BIOS and it's only got a single by us as
well so isn't that like false
advertising last time I checked it was
but anyway the bottom line is they put a
I seven on this motherboard out of the
box they see here default default
settings the revision to
throttled after two and a half minutes
the revision 1 didn't throttle at all
doesn't happen not only that your VRMs
running cooler as well so this is
completely this is really disgusting i
mean i've recommended this motherboard
personally this is why i've kind of i'm
a bit really disappointed actually in
gigabytes that i've recommended this
motherboard in the past i've said hey
the be 85 m amazing value for money $50
board couple it with a whatever cpu if
you're not really overclocking too high
and you'll be getting good performance i
have to go back and change that review
now and put some big text in there and
say do not buy this motherboard if it's
a revision to only buy it if it's the
revision 1 and i shouldn't have to do
that and they shouldn't be confusing
their customers in that way because this
isn't a revision this is a significant
downgrade and they should be releasing
it under a new name the be 85 m whatever
bd3 change the name don't use the same
name that's like I really don't like
that so let me know what you guys think
about this like would you go and buy a
revision 2 and have your CPU throttling
I wouldn't I certainly and I'm not going
to recommend it so yeah as US hardware
info pointed out this is a really good
article you guys should go read it as
they pointed out other companies have
done this in the past except they put
better hardware on and so it's not at
the denture Minh the curve of the
customer so people go out and buy things
based on reviews that us reviewers do
then they can rest assured that they're
going to get a product that works like
the review said it would as opposed to
this this isn't going to work as we said
it would this is a significant downgrade
so rua gets my blood boiling anyway so
there's another article here i think
that pulled the same i don't have to don
their own pictures or they pulled it off
the US hardware and phone but these are
the guys who ran the test so i'll put
their article first but it let's get on
with the next piece of news here this is
the hands-on with microsoft's hololens
and now i'm not going to focus so much
on the hollow lens itself as i'm going
to focus on VR headsets and how i think
going into the future these are going to
be the future if that makes any sense so
every month now I read tech news I read
it I love it
and I noticing more and more that VR
headsets are just popping up everywhere
oculus rift google glass hollow let now
the hollow lens and so it makes me step
back and think hey this is going to be
the future next five to ten years I
think you're going to see VR headsets
being used more I think they're going to
gain more support I even possibly am
going to guess that the next gen
consoles could be VR headsets that's
just my guess on it and so I mean
personally I don't know I'm kind of
scared with the VR headset like I
haven't tried one yet I actually really
want to try one but I'm kind of like a
little bit perplexed as to putting
something in front of my face for hours
and having that so close to my vision
having that so close to my eyes wouldn't
that affect you in certain ways not to
sure I mean the said reviewer here said
that he experienced a bit of vertigo
after using this so the something needs
to be looked into I mean the possible
health side effects of using a VR
headset so I mean me recently I've got
blue light glasses on protecting myself
because i'm paranoid about this blue
light but anyway what do you guys think
about VR headsets I think they're going
to be the future especially going in the
next tablet so to say I think they can
be the next thing the next big thing but
now let's get on to the next piece of
news here and this is so exciting the DX
12 demo it stills the show a and at
their Microsoft build so i really i
watch the demo and i was really
impressed you guys should go watch it I
was just like wow that's jaw-dropping it
was really impressive so the guy was
talking at the front at the start of the
video in Japanese and he did something
that he did point out something I
noticed was he he's like with the help
of nvidia and microsoft so in video and
microsoft i guessing are really putting
a lot of money into the next final
fantasy i guess they could see that as
the next big is it going to be an MMO i
mean if it's an MMO then it could be a
huge project and it could really harness
really propel pc gaming into the next
gen especially since people kind of
getting bored of World War raft I mean
I'm personally getting bored of World of
Warcraft so if this is going to be the
next big thing and NVIDIA and Microsoft
for putting a lot of money into it
stands that they have a lot to make out
of this as well it'll be good for both
Microsoft and NVIDIA their brand names
but one thing that is impressive is that
dx12 is looking like it's gaining a lot
of traction and a lot of support and
this is what makes me happy because as
we said in the video six to 12 times
more polygons then dx11 like wow that's
really impressive and so what we're
going to get with dx12 is just a better
gaming experience and I can't wait so
it's really good and I think this time
around is opposed to previous DX gen
games I think dx12 is gaining a lot of
support and that's really good so let me
know what you guys think about dx12 I
think I can't wait for it personally so
I mean less you know CPU overhead and
all that all the goodness that comes out
of it it just sounds really good and now
we're going to move on to the next piece
of news here with the 980 TI this is
actually I'm going to pull this up
because it was just a short article and
it was really accurate i think in my
opinion and so apparently the 980 TI is
going to come out sooner than we thought
and it's going to have six gigabytes of
gddr5 which makes about sense seeing
it's based on the same chip as the Titan
X just with half the vram and it's going
to have apparently the same amount of
cuda cores and I've argued this in the
past I don't think I think it'll have
one less Kloster then the tight necks
just to keep the tight neck look great
the king of the hill sort of thing
though I can't wait for this and I mean
I've already reported on this before but
me being a tech enthusiasts it's like
GPU CPUs and motherboards and all that
it gets my blood boy I love it no I mean
not blood-borne so it makes me just it
gets me excited so any piece of news in
regards to graphics cards and CPUs kind
of gets pushed to the front of the line
here so anyway let's move on to the next
piece of use it's on sort of the same
topic here and it's the r9 390 x and the
980 TI benchmarks have been leaked and
the 960 TI i mean all these all these
graphs college is magically getting
leaked into the public and the
benchmarks coming out i mean i think the
title should read are you gullible ?
here's some benchmarks take it as you
will that's what that's
the title should be because I which I
looked at these benchmarks I'm late what
like Walter White from Breaking Bad so
that's that's kind of like what what I
got when I took out of these benchmarks
so for what it's worth though I mean
with the GF at the i-93 90 and I've said
it before the UH 93 90 x we I really got
to wait and see because the Titan ax has
been released and we already know it
performs like a freaking beast it's king
of the hill and so the onus is on AMD to
perform and I think we can only really
wait until they bring out there are 93
90 x and then we'll have some solid
information oh but damn it on to the
next piece of news with graphics cards
the r9 380 has apparently been launched
by an oem HP and it's apparently just a
7 950 so I mean I'm really I don't know
what's going on AMD I really want to see
these graphs guards come out and I want
to see them come out as soon as possible
but as I mentioned in before in the past
every month that goes by is kind of like
you know sales that amd's losing its
market share that Andy's losing and I've
spoken about this in the past so many
times I'm not going to you know sound
like a broken record anymore so I mean
previous tech talks are there you can go
through them and watch them if you want
where I give my thoughts on the AMD
especially the financial side of the
company and so yeah I mean I just want
to see it release the UH 9390 already as
the first comment there pointed out the
big troll face that's pretty funny first
comments just a big troll face so let's
get on to the next piece of news now
this is who is using your facebook and
now the government spies on your phone
so apparently this person here Musa
uberly opened his facebook in 2011 and
he found someone using his facebook and
a mage it makes me wonder when I sit
back and I look at this going on it
makes you wonder how much access the
government actually has and it's pretty
scary and it kind of there's two sides
to the tail this might actually i might
in a further Tech Talk have to go in a
lot more depth into this because there
is two sides of the coin I mean look at
some of the tear
our stuff going on lately it does give
justification to spying but then you
look at like ordinary people like you
know the said person in this article
using his facebook and getting hacked by
the government this kind of makes you
wonder like what is going on so the
whole privacy thing is really up in arms
at the moment it's really there's two
there is two sides to the coin and I
think I need to talk about this more in
the future so let me know what you guys
think but it's pretty scary when the
government can get access to your
facebook to your Twitter and they know
things that you're doing that you would
just otherwise want to keep private
there's some things that I just want to
keep private I don't want to tell people
about how my marriage is on the rocks or
something like that but I mean the
government hey they apparently they want
to know so sorry let's get on to the
next piece of news here this is the AMD
Zen architecture and the processes are
going to be true quad cores or true
aight cause or true 16 cores and
basically this article just shows i mean
i've talked about zen in the past but
this article just shows it in real black
and white so i'll put the description a
link in the description below for you
guys but we can see here they're going
back to the smt architecture that's the
simultaneous multi-threading
architecture and you see how simple it
is now you see how much better will be
as well and this cpu should perform a
lot better than the FX series line
though apparently it's going to be on 14
nanometer so that we've got a big drop
in the node there big shrink in the node
it's also going to support for ddr4 as
well the TTP figures are pretty good as
well but one thing I'm curious about is
where is the no GPU onboard solution for
us desktop enthusiast where is that I
want to know what that's going to bring
to the table if we can going to get some
price pricing may be a little bit of a
leak I want to know what's going on I'm
really curious so every time I read
about Zen apparently alls I'm reading is
just AP use AP use I don't want an EP
you because i know that ate that GPU
portion on that APU is i'm going to
perform as well as a beast desktop
graphics card from either AMD or nvidia
so i'm curious to know what the cpu only
solutions are so we got here another
mention of a 16
or as well 32 thread cpu and so this
will essentially be targeted at the
server market i believe though a man if
they get something like this and its
really good price of performance they
can well indeed gain a bit of market
share back so i'm looking forward to the
release of zen and i hope we can get a
good cpu enthusiast variant out of it as
well so anyway AMD's upcoming fiji GPUs
will feature the new memory interface so
this is pretty much confirmed now and
that the i-93 90 x and the island 390
are going to have the HBM that's the
high bandwidth memory solution on board
and apparently it's also going to drop
the latency of the memory as well so
they're focusing on latency as well I
mean how this manifests in the real
world I don't know like how this is
manifest two games it will there be a
visible drop in input lag I don't know I
be keen to see I'm actually really
looking forward to the i-93 90 and what
it has to offer for the gaming community
the one thing I will state is that
apparently the what I've read the HB ms
having delays so that's what's causing
the r9 390 and the three 980x delays so
I mean honestly we can only wait and see
that's with the r9 390 there's just so
much news on there about zen and r9 390
x floating around it's kind of like I
think we're all at the stage now where
hey just release it but I mean I feel
obligated to report to you guys as I
think as tech enthusiasts this is what
makes us getting all excited anyway it
certainly does for me whenever I read
news about GPUs and CPUs it gets me very
excited so anyway let's get on to the
last piece of news here this is Marcus
soft is essentially they are looking at
bringing in lockscreen ads on Windows 10
and now when I looked at this I'm like
one part of me it made my blood boil
like I was like oh you know you turn on
your phone there's an advert right in
front of your face but another part of
me sort of made me step back and think
like hey this could actually work if
people want a free version of Windows I
mean look at how many people pirate
windows out there I mean that I know
there's a lot of people who pirate
just freaking they've got a pirate a
copy of windows I think Microsoft could
counter that if they introduced a
version of Windows that was free and had
advertising on it I think that could
work I think it could work well to be
honest though you know the article here
is like the reviewer grant bana grant
brunner has got really sort of his sort
of got a big bad taste in his mouth and
I can understand why I mean right I
personally I'd pay money to have my OS
have no ads on it but I mean hey it's
just an option i think they Microsoft
could look into it I mean especially
since people could get a free copy of
Windows the song that they could
implement then that would be actually
pretty good sorry there's just very my
thoughts out there if you guys enjoyed
this tech talk then please give it a
thumbs up if you have any questions or
comments about this episode and please
let me know in the conversation below I
have a few reviews to do as well so stay
tuned for them and yeah catch you guys
on another video very soon anyway that's
it for today peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
