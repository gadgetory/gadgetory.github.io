addressed the yes the series where you
guys ask questions and you send them in
and if they're too difficult to answer
with a simple comment then I usually
elaborate for you guys in this very
series now the good thing is all the
comments have been contained from within
the previous episode so we're not
needing to expand out of the comments
from other videos I don't know if that's
a good or a bad thing
but I'm gonna do my best to answer those
questions for you so let's get it all
first up here we have qui on that Xing
song he says hi Brian this is a question
for the next address the yes series I
bought a gtx 1066 gear buy with the deal
of RM 600 i'm from malaysia it's about
199 AUD close to 145 US dollars however
the brand is a China brand called manly
they have been producing PC products
since 1996 but I just want to know if
you've ever heard of this brand before
and if it's reliable like the other
brands thanks I have heard of manly
before but unfortunately I haven't tried
them yet and I'm guessing since they're
making 10 series cards that they're
actually an official and video board
partner they're just not selling over in
ours or the US for example but with that
said Nvidia do have stringent rules that
they require their board partners to
implement on the PCBs for example and
also in regards to the coolers so you're
going to be rest assured that that thing
will work absolutely fine especially
since there's a 1060 if you start going
up to a 1080i or 1080p example then you
might want to get a little bit more in
depth with what they're putting on the
PCB and also the cooler but for ten
seasons should be absolutely fine next
up we have freaky Windows 10 he says hey
tech yes city what kind of a bill would
an 80 i7 990 work good in and what would
it run games thanks 7 990 what build
would have worked good in I I'm gonna
say that I actually don't think it would
work well and really anything because
the problem with that card is the frame
buffer itself I think you go like a 3d
byte buffer really even though the RAM
might seem doubled and dx12 really isn't
utilizing the features it promised and
so with that you've got a 7970 that's
buffed up with two GPUs now and the
power consumption is huge so you're
gonna need a really good power supply
which costs more money you've got a card
that will dump a lot of heat in the case
and honestly it's like that argument of
the 690 versus the 680 when I tested the
six 90s out even when I tested out a
single solution for example it sometimes
ran worse than the GTX 680 so in terms
of what it could play I'm sure it could
play a lot of titles at 1080p absolutely
fine but you may run into driver issues
and stuttering and you I think it's just
a lot more hassle and problems than it's
worth
in terms of seriously implementing this
and a build I just sell it off and go
like a single
7970 that'd be much better value for
money in my opinion next up we got Nick
D he says law I used the 8700 K with a
1066 gigabyte referring to the previous
episode where I blasted a hater and his
comment about the four core video I did
where I used it with a 1060 so thanks
thanks for that Nick next up we've got
by Tokuda 82 he says can you do more
belligerent responses to hater comments
cuz those were entertaining and
hilarious I think there was one hater
that was sly wakka but in terms of Paul
I think he was just convicted and
passionate about his stance I don't
think he was exactly a hater
and so I mean I did have to respond
because he was sort of very strong in
his I guess a bit too strong and he sort
of implied things that I thought were
completely wrong but in terms of slight
wacky yeah I mean if that kind of stuff
comes up I will address it it doesn't
actually come up a whole lot I mean
there's the typical sort of hater
comments you get like a few and you're
this you're that I mean but then
sometimes you get the haters that are
just so like I don't know they're
confident in their own stupidity I guess
they're the guys you've got to respond
to and blast next I've got Artemis he
says it's pronounced a soos confirmed by
Zeus employees themselves over at asus
next up welder pedia says it's asus just
like the Greek word anus a noose a ring
here we have stanislav may your store of
he says I have a ZOTAC x58 motherboard
and the boss doesn't have a lot of
overclocking features I try to update
the boss but it isn't better I was
wondering if I could change the boss
like putting a bias from Anna Zeus
motherboard absolutely not
a biases are very strict in fact if you
put even a same manufacturer
motherboards BIOS with like a H 81 for
example from gigabyte with H 81 from
gigabyte even if the identifiers at the
end is slightly different you still
won't have a chance or hope in hell of
booting that board up anymore sometimes
you can get away with specific OAM
motherboards where they've used the
board like MSI
actually has a retail variant it's
actually the same multiple they've just
named it differently and in fact I
believe with like a CD 55 or something
back in the day with H 50 five
motherboards MSI just put a sticker over
and was the exact same board and then
you could flash that board and then
unlock the features to overclock but in
that regards of using a BIOS on your
ZOTAC board you may wish to get some
boss mod tools out especially if it's
like an ami abayas or something like
that then you can inject some extra
options to try and overclock I think
those guys are the boss mod forums they
do an excellent job sometimes you can
put in the forum requests and one of the
helpful folks over there will help you
out I'll put a link in the description
for you next we have Bob in the
Netherlands I can get a secondhand GTX
1080i for about 550 euro which is 8 $89
what kind of second-hand prices do you
have over there in Aussie land it's
pretty similar I mean for a good 10 atti
you're gonna be paying around about that
money I pick them up for around about
700 to 800 dollars depends on how
desperate I am for a 1080 GI I've seen
them go even cheaper than that sometimes
650 on terms of 1080 they go for as low
as 400 so there are some really good
deals in Aussie land but I think the
Euro that's actually a really good price
that you're posting there Bob zurk says
when's the next can yes fix it episode
when you fix that MSI be 150 mobo with
the bent pins I was shocked you got a
working you should do more fixing the
next kenya's fix it I've actually got a
lot of stuff here but I won't be filming
that for a little while yet because
there's these other promises that I got
to get done and they're getting done and
then they can yes fix it will be
somewhere there
next up laggy hacker he says could you
make comments a little bigger it's hard
to read on mobile if you are not close
to the screen
much obliged next up we have missed the
bezel Bobby says have you considered
testing out how games perform on Linux I
think would make for an interesting
video especially since valve has taken
some steps to get certain windows games
playable on Linux with their proton
update if you see this comment I hope
you're doing well thanks man I'm doing
pretty well always busy but doing well
health is all good most important thing
but besides that the Linux I've heard
those articles about the Steam games
being able to be played on Linux but the
Select games there are very few and
they're not the mainstream multiplayer
titles so as soon
like all the popular multiplayer titles
that are on Twitch at the moment for
example are available on the linux steam
port then i will take a look at it
because if they can get that going and
it's a free OS then they've got a really
good upper hand but even if they can get
the performance better than Windows 10
then that would be an absolute win in my
opinion next up we the people have
spoken
oh man ja ja was the absolute death of
Star Wars X well that's a lot of
exclamation marks smash that thing then
go slap Lucas for me thanks what did
George I ever do to you man next up
hanwen leaves as my CPU is 8700 k at 5
gigahertz 1.3 3 volt so I just sold my
h1 15 high and got a crackin X 62 my
temps at 65 to 78 degrees when playing
Rainbow six I used to have mid 50s with
my h1 59 I wonder is there anything I
could do I have applied different
thermal compounds even tried thermal
grizzly that's so far knock she'll
perform the best that's still like 20 C
more than I used to get and then Gregor
he says they're both units a stack pump
they should be similar but actually I've
tried the corsair all-in-ones in the
past and especially the h1 tens and the
H 115 eyes they're the 280 mill versions
and they do a phenomenal job for
all-in-one coolers
when I've tested them they beat out like
all the other all-in-ones by quite a big
margin so that's not surprising since
you're going to 5 gigahertz on that ring
bus CPU the heat needs a good cooler and
I think Corsair designed the block a
little bit better too so that 20 degrees
is real next I went David Williams he's
a 25 to 34 followed by a sad face Brian
you taught me to build pcs and do the
hustle and grind well into my forties
but just do what you do forget targeting
an age group people love what you do as
your friend to the previous episode and
thanks a lot for the compliments glad
you're getting some benefits out of my
content I love helping people that's the
reason I started YouTube in the first
place and it's awesome I didn't really
die I guess I might have did something
in that previous episode I meant that
I'm gonna K to my content towards just
yet people who are 18 years Innova so
mature people and here we got Brian
Liddell he says addressed yes do you
ever run into driver issues with older
GFX cards recently installed gtx 780 one
machine
and the later drivers kept crashing
randomly so it took him weeks he has an
ex 5440 CPU and he's not sure it won't
be the last time he has this problem
love your channel and keep the budget
stuff coming and regards to this itself
I haven't really had any problems with
Nvidia drivers I have had some problems
rarely with like the AMD Verizon CPUs
and the Nvidia drivers on the 10 series
cards but that's been solved when you've
just used that program brainfart I can't
think of it it's the one that deletes
the registry and then you reinstall
things and then it it works absolutely
fine again I'll put the link in the
description below when I think of it but
you actually might want to use that
program and that could fix your problems
too but in the past when I've used like
a 780 for example I've never had a
problem but I have had people in the
past tell me that they have had problems
most specifically on the 7 series cards
ironically next up fpv and CLE says love
the jar jar mug and the jar jar mug
loves you he remembers the video when
you got that and keep up the good great
work brain I remember what I got that
thing too I loved that mug it's like my
favorite mug
I don't know why I didn't bring it down
to this episode leaks on no and says hi
man longtime subscriber and loving your
work my question is how far will the X
30 480 go in terms of OSI I have one but
had no luck overclocking it I've got a
aged 55 and p55 Oakland tutorial I'll
put up here for you x 34 80s should be
able to overclock to 4 gigahertz with
ease if you've got a good cooler and a
decent motherboard sometimes I find
unlike gigabyte motherboards for example
in that era they can run into some bug
where they just refuse to overclock at
all so that might be happening to you
I'm not just sure but in terms of its
potential it's even better than the ex
34 17 X 34 40 well well actually it's
got a little bit more wiggle room
next up Ritchie died says why don't you
hunt for AMD CPUs I actually do when
they come up for the right price it's
all about the price and here on the Gold
Coast they rarely come up and when they
do come up I feel like they're
overpriced especially when you compare
that to what you can get at Xeon and
even a motherboard off Aliexpress 4 and
so the value really starts to drop I
have missed out however on to rise and
deals that have come up people have
snatched them up before me and they've
been
really good value for money so it just
really depends but I do look for him
next up we got Peter fix-it 151 that's
not how the economy works if everyone
buys something that shows that there is
a higher demand than average and the
price will go up for example eBay and
Aliexpress he's referring to the data
that comment in the previous episode
where the user the commenter was
referring to economies of scale you're
referring to supply I mean demand on a
fixed supply so you're both correct I
guess it just depends on which context
you're looking at it in the original
commenter was referring to if a lot more
people just buy these things then
there'll be more demand and then I guess
the companies can scale up production
and then source parts cheaper and
economies of scale come into effect next
up squishy posters coming through with a
solid fear boy you're a real OG Brian
good idea with the research on a
straight girls love that extra I'm gonna
use this I'll keep you updated main I'm
looking forward to your updates it's
actually kind of now you got me curious
please keep us posted
next up song woodfire says now you can
keep wearing your glasses you need to
get used to having them on in order to
maintain the benefits and not let your
eyes get worse I'm taking your advice on
wood fire next up good Van Van Damme
edgy he says by the way at 27 minutes
King spec is awesome value I have two
King spec SSDs and raid zero and they
work absolutely fine
so in the previous episode we talked
about King spec SSDs so I guess that
answers that question another commenter
said they were pretty good as well so so
far - good comments and no negatives
King spec next up well leon fpv says hey
Brian would you revisit the non KB clock
over clock in 2018 I can't get any
biased version to overclock except the
Devourer posted back in the day I've got
the i-5 6400 and managed to get a stable
OC all course 4.8 gigahertz on 1.3 5
volt I was referring to the z1 70s they
did work with 6 gen CPUs where you could
overclock them but then Intel released
the seventh gen CPUs they locked them at
the microcode level so you could never
overclock the seventh gen CPUs that
weren't meant to be overclocked but 6
gen severes on particular z170
motherboards they could work but then
they updated the BIOS and then
they locked that feature out as well so
you didn't in a very a specific bios to
overclock and in this case the bear I
think made some custom biases I actually
haven't delved too far into this I do
have a z170 here and actually an i-5
6400 T or something and I am going to do
a video on this but I actually haven't
really tried too much in this so I
wouldn't know unfortunately they said
well Lodge ditch one he says hey brother
enjoyed this video noticed you talked
about the data vac and he's talking
about cleaning kits and he's got some
great ideas so I'm gonna leave this
comment up here for you guys he's tried
to makita lxt 18 volt cordless blower it
costs less and of course being a Makita
it's very reliable and it pushes out
more air as well and in terms of me
personally I love the dotter vac I tried
it and it's just perfect for cleaning I
just can't imagine it getting any better
and then a couple of with a wd-40 you
got the new meta they're the Double
Trouble and I just don't imagine it
getting any better but I do think it
could get better
next up Pascal he comes in with three
questions he says number one what do you
do if a gravis car gets a very bad or
loud cooling design III a way from the
reference designs unless they're really
cheap and then if you get them for
really cheap you can then whack on
something like the Arctic extreme I
think it's the version 3 of version 4
they're both pretty good and that will
fit a lot of AMD and NVIDIA graphics
cards especially the ones where they put
out the bat reference models so you can
fix that noise fix those temps but in
terms of using them personally I never
used bad designs that are very loud
number 2 do you put windows from a used
build just on the hard disk drive or do
by an SSD for those builds depends on
the price point I usually budget options
you just go with a one terabyte hard
drive you know once you step it up a bit
above that you can put in a 120 gigabyte
SSD especially they only cost like 30
Ozzie dollars now it really adds to the
value the end uses a lot happier they
got a snappy experience and especially
if you couple them with older hard
drives as well the SSD can just bring
you life to a system to number three do
you have at any time heard creepy noises
out of a hard disk drive do you change
them or do you let them in thanks for
answering my questions if you've got
noises that are weird coming out of
hard drives please or at least one of
them do me a favor and back up your
daughter on that hard drive I don't
think that thing has a long life left on
it before it goes poof and when it goes
kaput it's like Thanos just clicked his
fingers and your daughters gone next up
we got Matthew he says are you trying to
get into a boy band no I'm trying to
grow my hair out to become a
philanthropist next up we got James
Cullen he says loving the series and all
the content you're making B my question
is what would you do when there's no
deals in your local area I'm based in
Ireland so I know that people tend to
overprice that text off when selling on
sites that aren't the equivalent to
Gumtree or are the equivalent in that
case if you've got no local deals it
kind of sucks but you then you've got to
broaden your horizon to things like
forums especially in your country
overclocking forums there are some
really good deals there of course eBay
Amazon for the use section and you can
pick up some really good deals
Aliexpress is always a good one as well
but besides that I am I guess blessed
that the Gold Coast does have deals when
I was in Japan there were a lot of deals
there too I'm yet to sort of live in a
place where there's not many deals so I
do feel a little bit sorry for you next
time where s diasporic he says number
one what is your experience with the GPU
Co one do you see it as a problem or do
you not really care especially funny cuz
in the past people have complained about
coil one it doesn't bother me at all
there's certain noises that I think
affects certain people for instance if
I'm around someone and they don't close
their mouth when they're eating that
just drives me nuts but for other people
that might be fine and then for other
people that coil wine might really annoy
them but for me koi one doesn't bother
me at all
it was sort of prevalent in the ninth
series I think a lot of people will
complain about the 970 for example
having coil wine if you want to hear
core wine you can load up particular
menus I think the Skyrim menu is
notorious for like pushing into the
thousand FPS mark and then there you can
get some serious core wine out of
practically any GPU but yeah it depends
if you've got really high FPS and you
can start hearing coil one but it never
really bothers me personally it just
depends on your ears next I've got
number two courses vs line of power
supply's couple a lot of hate thanks for
bringing a bit of sense to the
discussion
I wish you went a bit further as I think
they're a great value and there are 650
watt models power supply requirements
are are easily the most misunderstood
aspect of PC building the BS just won't
stop is it really so hard for people to
sit down and calculate the 12 volt
output instead of cutting and pasting
some fake news in every damn thread he's
a friend of the previous episode where I
sort of responded with the vs series I
used them and they're great if you're
just using low powered options
especially than the non overclockable
even if you're coupling it with an i5
and then like a gtx 1060 or a gtx 750ti
you have absolutely no problems but if
you want to start overclocking and
getting into the enthusiast options and
of course there are much better power
supply options out there and of course
they're going to cost a lot more but
when it boils down to it that 12-volt
line is rated for the actual output from
the power supply to your parts and when
I measure from the wall I'm not even
going anywhere near those numbers and
that's still accounting for the 5 volt
and 3 point 5 volt lines that are
getting converted as well so in other
words you have a lot of power at your
disposal next up we've got Nash goring
he says address the yes I'm you and a
flipping pieces wood buying new RGB
cases be worth it and increase the value
a lot and if so do you have any
suggestions thanks for such awesome
content yeah I mean it depends on where
you live in what cases you can get I
here on the Gold Coast you can get some
really cheap cases that actually looked
pretty good I mean the airflow is not
really there but if you're putting in
low power consuming parts it's not
really gonna matter
so RGB and aesthetics do help sell
builds the better-looking the case the
more attractive it's going to be in the
photo and when people see it they eyes
are gonna light up and yeah definitely
getting to aesthetics on your builds
it's something you'd want to do if
you're into flipping those builds next
up we've got Karl's Wells he says whew a
bit of hate on this one but I'm a
believer buddy even though I'm out of
the demographics 41 years old or years
young I misread that 40 is the new 30
which was the new 20 so when I'm 50 I'll
be a teenager and we gotta address the
yes from New Zealand should I sell my
current PC what would be the best bet
for my other seven seven one system I
basically need to raise cash to get out
of debt so he currently has an 87 70 K
37 UK or
700 gain not too sure 16 gigabytes and a
GTX 780 decent case power supply and of
course the RGB strip and he's got a dual
socket semsem one system to get out of
debt you've got to ask yourself is that
computer worth it to you or not for
instance I know people that go out and
buy 7900 exes 79-80 xes
and they don't even use the power
whatsoever but if you're using your
current main rig a lot
I'd recommend keeping it but in terms of
if you're using your 7-7 one system and
you don't notice that much of a
difference between the two then that's
up to you is that money that you've got
sitting around was essentially that
build that 3770k or 8700 K I'm not sure
which it is that's worth money and if
you don't notice much of a difference
when you're seven seven one system and
that then I'd recommend ya just selling
it often getting out of debt but in
terms of the 780 with an i7 it's I
personally sell the 780 individually and
then whack in say a nine or ten series
graphics card because that'll raise the
value of the whole build a lot more than
selling it with a 7 Series card hope
that helps next I wear a B what happened
to that brother Evo X it's actually an
Evo 7 and it was just way too modified
it was not a practical everyday driver
it was taking up too much garage so we
unfortunately sold it and I think that
thing was like a high 11 seconds like it
was a really quick car that thing went
hard next up with Lucy a boy 7 5 8 he
says about to do a complete bill but
don't mind buying any used
recommendations or deals you know of
internationally upgrading from my HD 77
90 i 3 2120 dell optiplex 390 PS new
build only for gaming and please don't
make me have to rob a bank I would go
for at the moment the sweet spot would
be like picking up a used 10 60 they go
for very cheap whether it be three gig
or six gig models and then going with
like an ex 34 4 th 55 motherboard and
overclocked it of course and you're
gonna be home and hosts next up we've
got John Paul bacon says another good
video here is a question what do you
think if someone was to use an
all-in-one design for the thread rippers
on a non thread ripper CPU would it be
cooled better or just using a standalone
bit better it all depends on the surface
size of course the thread Ripper CPUs
themselves have a huge IHS with a
massive surface size so the standard
cool
weren't designed to incapacity
so then the thread ripper coolers do
better on thread river when it comes to
like an i7 or a typical ring boss or
even a risin cpu those IHS is those
blocks that are currently made from our
encompassing all that surface area so I
guess unless they're using a different
pump and a better design you wouldn't
actually notice any difference really
because there's not any extra surface
contact to be cooled from that area next
I work Jimmy one life he says one eye is
just looking for them deals and steals
referring to the previous episode we
talked about the lazy eye and that is
true one eye is always on the hunt for
them deals they say what parent hey
Brian I've watched your content for
quite a while but I really don't know
which way to go I have a budget of $500
and I don't really know whether or not
to go the x58 route I'm only going to be
gaming so I don't really know what a
good combo would be for my situation
have you got any recommendations for
this budget I'm regards to x58 I love it
but you only go x58 if you get the deals
like if you pick up that person selling
an i7 920 rig for like a hundred bucks
and it's got that gold next 58
motherboard that's when you pounce on
that in general or if you're in Japan
x58 motherboard go very cheap but open
that up yeah go with that x34 40 routing
gtx 1060 that's currently an amazing
option for the money you'll get away
with that for under $500 might even be
able to put in an SSD and have some
great components in there for the future
nice air we got tech one he says hey
Brian long time tech yeah citizen and
patron I had to stop patron recently but
we'll be back when my situation improves
I mean I'm gonna stop right there it's
fine dude I don't like patients just one
of those things if you guys appreciate
the content appreciate the hassle to
grind and you enjoy watching this
content the options that a sports you
don't have to support us of course I
thanks a lot for supporting us thus far
as well but we got on with your question
just a quick question I have an
overclocked ex 56 56 core system and an
e5 2670 v18 core system nan
overclockable obviously i'm gonna sell
one which would you keep for gaming and
video editing it depends on how far
you've overclocked that X 56 52 I guess
it does retain a little bit more value
than the 2670 v1 cuz no one really knows
what that is so personally I probably
keep the e5 2670 v1 if you can get away
because it is a higher multiplier it's
not bad
clock to like three points something
gigahertz on the lake cause and for
video editing especially Adobe can now
use eight core 16 threads so I'll be
better off keeping that and then making
value out of your axe 5650 system and
also if you got that x79 motherboard let
us know more about it in the comments
next I where Batsy 22 he says hey Brian
would you recommend to buy use mind GPUs
and so and if so how to clean them the
best way I heard they put a software on
mining GPU is that true love your daddy
love you son and I always recommend
people by mining GPUs if the price is
right i've been snatching up a few
myself got some really good deals of
course make sure they're under warranty
especially if you're just buying one for
yourself and you really want it to work
do make sure they have a warranty and a
receipt oh that you most likely have to
change the thermal paste get them
running perfect again make sure the fans
work 100% and the best way to clean them
is just to take them off and then give
them a data back replace the thermal
paste and you're good to go in terms of
putting software on there you can't
really put software on there but people
do modify the biases to up the memory
speeds lower the power consumption lower
the core clocks that was better a think
for a theory of mining and so if they do
sell them just they should be changing
the boss back to default which is better
for gaming but even if you're getting
him at the right price it shouldn't
matter a whole lot
next go where AMG a mighty grizzly he
wrote in about feedback on last episode
