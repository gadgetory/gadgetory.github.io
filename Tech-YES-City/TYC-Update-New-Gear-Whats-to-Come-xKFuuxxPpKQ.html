much videos as I'd like to and that's
because I was hospitalized over a week
ago for about two days due to a bad case
of food poisoning but I'm all better now
I'm back on track to get you guys more
content and after Christmas YouTube
decided to pay me something more than
just out of a convenience store sandwich
so we've got some new upgrades around
here too
welcome back to tech yes it is brian
coming back you guys there was kind of
like a vlog a little bit of an update to
let you guys know what's happened around
here recently and let's get on with it
so the first things first the desk I got
a 1 20 by 60 and 2 1 40 by 60 millimeter
deaths so there's going to be a lot more
room to work around here especially when
i'm setting up test rigs and reviewing
products and also i got a new video
tripod from amazon which is is actually
on special i think it was like a round
about 50 USD six thousand yen in japan
and it's like a full-functioning video
tripod with two handles it's even got a
missile launch button on it too so
what's there not to like about that so
you're probably wondering what this
thing is this is a watch that I recently
got sent I'm actually wearing it now so
i'll be doing a review of this is
actually some kind of like coded watch i
think it's kind of cool so stay tuned
for that so next year we've got the
crucial be x 100 kind of like the MX 100
great value great product for the money
and then next up here we have the Xeon
1231 which in my opinion is one of the
hottest cpus to get right now even if
you're a gamer it's actually in this rig
in the background which I'll talk about
very soon for you guys so next up here
we have the b85 pro gamer from a Zeus
this thing i mean what can i say
phenomenal value for money at the moment
it's going out on sale i think they
probably want to get it at rid of it
however it's such a great value for
money motherboard i'll be doing a review
of this soon it's actually in the rig in
the background here and i'll talk about
that soon as well so lastly in the
background here this is the latest
project that i just finished i still
have to brand it a name so if you have
any suggestions for the names and go at
it in the comments also my x 99 rig
that's currently getting some cosmetic
upgrades so that's out of action at the
moment and yeah this thing's going to be
featured in an upcoming ultimate build
guide it's going to be a true ultimate
build guide so there's no sponsored
parts or anything like that it's just a
true sweet spot build for the money so
stay tuned for that it features a Zeon
1231 overclocked to 3.8 gigs on all
cores GD x 9
ebony to think about the ddr3 memory and
a be 85 the programmer that I talked
about before so I look forward to giving
you guys these videos in due time and I
hope you enjoyed this video if you did
please give it a thumbs up if you have
any questions about this video then
please leave a comment the comment
section below and yeah I can't wait to
give you guys more content anyway I'll
show you quickly show you missile launch
button has been turned off there's
missile launch buttons are crazy
nowadays everyone's gotta have one
especially if I flick at one time it'll
turn the fans and the LEDs off if I
flick it to the right it'll just turn
the fans on in silent mode without the
LEDs on so pretty cool I'm proud of this
thing anyway so it was peace out for now
