recorded a video of the best things I
saw at the event but then I went to
watch the video back and there was this
like horrible mic noise like I bought
this microphone here and this is
probably the worst thing of CES is I
paid 110 bucks for it and now has a
really good capsule on it but the
problem is is that when you're recording
the audio even the slightest sensitivity
to the cable itself will then introduce
a massive amount of noise and I mean
this shouldn't be happening on a
microphone that you pay a hundred and
ten dollars for especially when the
company's called the sound professionals
so whatever they did they put a cable on
this thing and I'll let you take a
listen to it this is just some crazy
noise that goes through the microphone
the moment you touch it or even just
move positions so I can't vlog with this
microphone at all in its current state
probably have to change the cable around
but all that aside let's finally sit
down and discuss what was the best
things I saw at CES 2019
the CES 2019 was scattered into a lot of
different sections there's some massive
showroom floors at the Venetian Hotel
but then also different companies
especially enthusiast tech companies had
their booze situated two hotels there
were sort of kind of in yonder so it
took a little while to go to some of
those booths but on the main Sherman
floor I did manage to go to the
automotive section where I think I saw
the coolest thing I've seen in a long
time and that was this massive drone
like helicopter thing it was called the
bell Nexus and I had six engines on it
and I guess it's the future of our
vehicles where we're currently just land
traffic in every city I guess every
major city in the world's getting
congested so this I guess will alleviate
that problem if we can start flying
so look really cool I have no idea how
much it cost but seeing this thing was
just unbelievable and then moving
through the Health section I actually
came across some really cool things I
did this health check where it took me
15 minutes and it cut off all the
circulation in my right arm and then it
measured the temperature of my left
finger versus my right finger and then
once the pressure is released after five
minutes it measured how quickly that
temperature rose back to being close to
the other temperature and so this
essentially coupled with a blood
pressure test gives you an idea of how
healthy you are I've managed to get
above average but admittedly I haven't
been exercising for a little while and
the lady did admit that cardiovascular
exercise was super important so
apparently that gives you a thirty view
exercise in the morning for example that
gives you like a 30% boost in blood flow
or something close to there for the rest
of the day so I was like damn one thing
I realized out of that test was to just
keep doing cardiovascular exercise now
if you're into getting a good night's
sleep or if you can't get a good night's
sleep I saw this device where you put it
on your head and then it measures your
brainwaves and the energies and stuff
like that and you can actually map over
three months that's what the recommended
period is all the sleep patterns you go
through and so you can sort of
correlate what mood you're in and what
you're thinking of with how you're
sleeping and so I thought this is really
cool because sometimes I can't get a
good night's sleep it's just there's
either a lot of stress on my mind
anxiety or I'm hungry or something like
that so this thing will give you data
over the long-run and then let you know
what you need for a best night's sleep
whether it just be eat a massive burger
before you go to bed which does the
trick for me
but some of this other stuff it's
interesting to definitely put that into
practice and see what would help me
sleep in the long-run now of course
getting back to enthusiast tech there
was so many different things on display
I did see a 256 gigabyte dim from
Samsung that's all that memory and one
stick this was a registered ACC dim
however it's just cool to see that much
memory I mean imagine having a two slot
mini ITX PC potentially with 512
gigabytes of RAM that'd be pretty crazy
so that was definitely on display as
well as the big announcements from AMD
Intel and NVIDIA Intel talked about
their 10 nanometer which is quite some
time away still yet they're definitely
gonna release that later in the year
AMD promised their risin 3000 series
CPUs for the mid-year and I was super
excited about this because they had a
single die solution for eight cores
rather than using two CC X's or two die
what they've done in the past with the
Verizon 1000 and 2000 series now people
are saying there are traces on that PCB
to accommodate another eight cause what
AMD intends to do with this no one
exactly knows just yet of course a 16
core part would be great
but me personally I was super excited
about a low latency single die eight
core solution this really got me excited
because personally I'm a big fan of a
lot of actions per minute and low
latency also continuing on with AMD's
keynote was the Radeon 7 which is their
new flagship gravis card intended to be
better value than the previous Vegas 56
and then also out of invidious
campbell's the RT X 2060 now I was
excited when I talked about both these
graphics cards of course their new
graphics cards are gonna be bringing
better value to
to market than their predecessors but of
course I do agree with you guys in the
comments they're not like super
innovative both these gravis cards
aren't offering more value than said
1060 was to a 960 or a Vega 56 was to an
r9 390 or something like that I mean the
price performance differences especially
for the time we've been waiting
certainly isn't nothing to get excited
about but it doesn't change the fact
that these gravis cards are still going
to be better value at the new price
points than the predecessors gravis
cards were so basically when it comes to
politics with enthusiasts tech companies
I don't really want any part of it I'm
just gonna get the product and review it
for its merits which in the case of the
RT X 2060 and the Radeon 7 forward to
covering for you guys now moving on to
the MSI booth this was where I saw some
really cool monitors they had a 5k ultra
wide display and they're using I think
they said nano IPS as well as promising
lower response times than previous
generation of IPS panels I think they'll
say 5 milliseconds but besides that they
also had a 1440p ultra wide panel with a
hundred and forty-four Hertz this was 34
inch and they said one millisecond MRP T
or something to do with that terminology
in response times so it looks like
they've gone away the gray to gray
response times but of course the
thousand FPS camera never lies I told
them I looked be looking forward to
reviewing one of these monitors which
will be out the mid-year in 2019 C be
expected in June or July but it's
definitely looking good for ms I have
for them to get into monitors but also
hit hard with some really good specs now
if you're into RGB LED lighting then
course it had on display the capella X
RGB lights this is essentially shrinking
your traditional 5050 RGB lighting and
making it very small so they can put so
many more RGB LED lights in a smaller
space and it's also more efficient
better power consumption so they can
essentially put out less heat for the
same amount of lights that you'd have in
your case as well as being able to do a
lot more unique things for instance they
have their Dominator memory the newest
version on display and that had just
really
lighting effects going through it as
well as having a new design as for audio
and PC lovers all in one creative had
their super XY headphone amp which was
really good this thing pretty much made
headphones come to life like a 5.1 and
7.1 speaker setup then they also had at
the same booth the ae9
sound card which way they were teasing
and they definitely said I'll be able to
get on hands-on with that when it's
released and give you guys a day 1
review so definitely looking forward to
that but that's about it for CES 2019
there was a lot of cool products there a
lot of refreshes a lot of improvements
coming for 2019 some of which would just
extend this video out way too much but
that was definitely some of the coolest
stuff that I saw that sort of just maybe
opened my eyes
blew me away of course some of the other
stuff they had there was just a lot of
fluff in my opinion they had so many
different things that I just looked down
and I was like there that doesn't really
interest me they even had a toilet on
display which got an Innovation Award so
I mean for me personally a toilets a
toilet and I just do my thing on it that
I guess CES seems to think that that was
a really cool product you guys that's it
for CES 2019 I hope you have enjoyed all
the coverage that I've brought to you
guys there wasn't a whole lot of it
unfortunately because I did have to run
around from one hotel to the other and
it was just super busy it's definitely
nothing like Computex especially if
you're an enthusiast tech that's a
different topic for a different day if
you're at the event let us know what
your favorite product was or if you've
been watching the videos what did you
think the coolest thing at CES 2019 was
love reading your thoughts and opinions
as always and don't forget to hit that
like button but from here on in there is
still one more thing to do in Vegas and
that is challenged the other youtuber
called Christopher Yee who's actually
called me out and once the day
price-performance rundown before the
best value for money Pacey you can build
so we're gonna get onto that and we're
gonna see how well we
do these out for now wait
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
