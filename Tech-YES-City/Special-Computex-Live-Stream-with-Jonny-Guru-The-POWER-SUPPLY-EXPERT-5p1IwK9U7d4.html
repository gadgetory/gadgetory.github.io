livestream with Johnny guru the power
supply expert of power supplies how're
you doing man all right Brian
nice to meet you meet you I guess a lot
of people wondering arm so growing up as
a kid I used to watch or read sorry
a lot of Johnny guru reviews and arm I
love the banter the humor that was the
best part so you always just
automatically sifted through the search
results our Johnny go click click like
yet is it a good power supply is it
rubbish that was pretty much the verdict
and what in your opinion makes or breaks
a power spline what are the most
important things so some of the things
that people so the P the things that
people assume is that efficiency if like
it has made certain 80 plus
certification is an automatic automatic
means of quality right where really it's
just efficiency some of the things you
want to look at is actually what the
temperature rating of the PSU is for
example some of the cheaper units there
they're only rated at like 25 C and it's
never going to be 25 senior in your PC
never might not even be in the room
right well with that right with that the
25 so yeah it's a detrimental thing in
itself because people with lower budgets
generally buy cheap okay and yeah and
the ones that come with the cases tend
to be rated at 25 C now the importance
of that is are the parts inside the
power supply they have what's called a D
rating curve right and so as the
temperatures get hotter those parts
capability to to output declines right
yeah so that's one of the biggest things
and then of course you know there's a
lot of people say you know how long is
this going to last if it's got these
capacitors and you know we talked about
this a little bit before and really the
whole capacitor issue of my opinion is
kind of overblown even the Japanese
capacitors you get aren't actually made
in Japan they're actually just Japanese
bringing all because they cost so much
to import into China so all the Japanese
companies have factories in China now
and that's how they saw the power supply
companies but you know a lot of thing
one thing that's really overlooked is
the fan that's the first thing that's
going to die in a power supply the Fei
a fan yeah so it's really good to have a
fan that I mean there's a lot of sleep
bearing fans out there and unfortunately
they don't last very long but you know
it's like a good rifle bearing fan or an
MDB fan or that bearing fan because
that's going to be the first thing that
dies ancestors buddies say because I
deal with a lot of used parts and that
is I've had to replace phantom power
supplies and they generally you know
they're dying to the like yeah it's yeah
now oh it sucks those when it does die
right and it just like completely dies
and you don't know it then the PSU just
heats up to the point where it's just
dead it means those off you're done
because all overheats and just dies
because it's a that's another thing
about a lot of power supplies they don't
always all have the protection so yes
right the over temperature protection
over power protection short-circuit
protection you kind of take for granted
that power supply is going to have all
that but they don't they don't always so
with that though I did have some
questions with regards to that no I've I
don't know anywhere near as much as you
know about power supplies that I did
have a cut two power supplies now that
would randomly cut out like it wasn't
dangerous you didn't see any sparks
flying on but when you like playing
games or and they were rated way above
what those parts would juice some of
that power supply so I was wondering and
you know ended up replacing the power
supplies system would work perfectly
other so would those would that be too
many protections in place or what would
that be y-yeah those laws just randomly
cut out the machine like that well so
really I mean it depends on the power
supply and you know we don't necessary
have to get in that but yeah but
sometimes we'll see a power supply it'll
just shut down like a cheaper power
supply it'll shut down when you start up
a game or benchmark that's a real heavy
load because there's so much power is
drawn by like the graphics card or even
the CPU through just the one connector
either a PCIe connector or the EPS
connector you know for the CPU yeah and
that power draw draws so much power so
quickly that it causes a drop in voltage
and then the power supply has under
voltage protection it sees that the
voltage is drop and it goes whoa
something's wrong
boom shuts off Wow so it's yeah yeah so
if it's a unfortunately you know I see a
lot of times with these guys that build
systems for a living yeah you know they
tell you you know I like
this graphics card the CPU this much
storage space as much memory they never
tell you what PSU is in there right and
then they put like you know 2g txt at 10
80s and they got a $40 power supply in
there and they're complaining that the
PC shuts down when they fire up you know
just 3dmark right and it just shuts down
oh they're complaining about this sudden
incense in their realize that you know
the smell of that beautiful smell in my
room oh yeah so yeah it could be the
under voltage protection and some power
supplies have over current protection
it's rarely that though that's that's
when if too much current but its sustain
current right so it's like it would have
to be like 30 amps continuous draw and
then it shuts down so it's probably not
OCP but it's another like you said it's
it could be any one of protections it
could be just a cheap power supply or it
could just be protections that are hyper
sensitive right yeah and that includes
OTP - like I said if the fan dies and
there's OTP the PSU is going to shut
down or if it's just a really hot
environment I mean you know if it's
thirty five forty five degrees inside
your your PC and the power supply is
just going to freak out and shut down
well I do remember I used to have a C
sonic power supply way back and that was
blowing out really hot air and that did
it for years and years and it never had
a problem well so but that's a good
thing though and that's it's kind of you
kind of think that it shouldn't be
blowing out hot air but what that's
actually telling you is that it's it's
doing its job evacuating the hot air out
of the power supply if you are getting
hot air out of the back of the power
supply and you're juicing a lot that
means it's just staying in the power
supply right you know so that's and a
more efficient I mean the thing is is
you know that when a CES converted to DC
obviously the byproducts heat yeah so
the more efficient power supply the the
less heat it's going to produce right so
it's not like effect if you have to
plant and power supplies one's not going
to run hotter than the other yeah but if
you feel that one of them has hot air
coming out of the bag or hotter air
coming out of the back than the other
that just means it's moving that air
better so I have a question though with
this fourth regards to this um we are
you know you've got different bowel
supplies designs now old-school used to
have the fans sort of pushing air in
that push sort of just push now oh the
ones with the Ferrand and
yeah yeah so and there you've got the
fan yelling it up which in your opinions
battle
well obviously pushing the air through
is more efficient but it's those 80
millimeter fans are loud yeah and and
and quiet is like you know so important
for people is that more now more than
ever everybody wants quieter and quieter
you know water cooling is actually
making a comeback before you know is
like because it was cool and now it's
because it's you know it's quiet right
you know um so do you think we'll ever
see a water-cooled pass fly I have
already seen actually yeah I've already
seen 10 a bunch of water-cooled power
supplies that you know ten years ago
coolants made a really cool water cool
power supply had my machine it was it
was basically a mineral oil bath the PSU
was all sealed a little bath and and I
think bits powers partnered up with FSB
and they have water blocks on on an FSP
power supply right now yeah so yeah I
mean it's kind of a that's kind of a
weird thing because power supplies don't
get hot enough really to justify having
to water cool I mean like if you look at
some of the Corsair power supplies with
the zero rpm mode yeah I have people
freaked out all the time it's like oh my
god the fan never turns on I'm like you
know what do you got well I've got you
know I've got like you know one 1060
card and I bought a thousand watt power
supply I'm like that person that thing
is never gonna turn on it doesn't matter
what you do yeah it's never going to
turn on because that power supply is
never going to get hot enough to justify
using a fan plus the efficiencies right
out there oh yeah that's what saying
yeah so like I said if you had you know
this the two two power supplies of the
same efficiency one is not going to be
hotter than the other because that AC is
going to get converted to DC and that
yeah that efficiency difference that's
your heat yeah that's about everybody
that's how I'm going to dance yeah I'm
from your articles yes but a lot of the
time too when I when I look at the power
side like I've I use a in Japan bar when
I was in I was hunting for used parts
I'd use a lot of like a delta ref ESPYs
these guys in Japan they'll selling
these things so cheap and they didn't
know their value and their 500 watt
power is getting the used ones and you
can't really get those deals in
Australia or us all because I don't
notice I've looked for them a lot and I
can't find it but in Japan
dime a dozen and so a lot of people be
like using a $10 pass but its garbage is
like laughs its adult yeah yeah yeah I
mean if you got a brand name I mean the
reputable tier one brand um you know
yeah you're fine
as well as I was trying to explain like
guys this is going into service right
yes not good yeah that's a thing if it's
a server if it's server power supplies
are you know mission-critical right yeah
they're made to not fail
they don't necessarily always have the
best voltage regulation or minimal
ripple that's all that's all consumer
level product because consumers read
reviews and and it's like you know this
guy makes a great power supply now the
next company comes will and they have to
make it better so they can get a better
review and and so we see power supply's
leapfrogging themselves every years for
its performance the servers it's just
it's all about efficiency and longevity
yeah and that's it but with that said
what can get better on past laws I mean
we're not talking RGB lighting yeah so a
term that gets used a lot on Johnny grew
calm is a sorry I'm tired mythic yeah
performance because we're to the point
now where it just our voltage regulation
and our ripple is so um sticking so
mythic there we go we use that word
again yeah that it doesn't matter
anymore right so now people and we're
seeing it this year right they're
looking for little niche things to do
with their power supplies to make them
different RGB lighting yeah water-cooled
yeah yeah stuff like that so the ripples
basically gotten to the stage where can
it get a lot better or it's so I mean so
the thing is right now it's it's so
tight I mean when you're done a twenty
millivolts yeah you can't differentiate
if that's coming from the power supply
or if that's just line noise you know
it's so yeah it's just so anything
that's twenty millivolts are better it's
it's a blurred line right so and so that
is that that's also a critical factor in
in getting the extra overclass like
you've got people - well yeah because I
say for instance I've seen other people
review products and they're like this
motherboard got an extra 100 or 50
megahertz and then they've used a
different house blather yeah yeah and
I've known in that the better yeah yeah
impression what not the better the the
voice of that side of that line
better idea and so that helps with
overclocks exactly no it does it really
does that and and not to brag but that's
that's why a lot of the guys like using
the ax 1500 I mean I know that sounds
like a plug but um no it's when they
don't look at that when the power supply
is not sponsored right and and and the
overclocker brings their own it tends to
be the ax 1500 i there's the is it's
digital and if the ripples just so you
know so divide yeah clean so you design
which power supplies at corsair did you
desire help design or oh let's talk
about those well we got to know this so
i want to know so the ax 1500 was your
no actually no x 1500 i was that was a
very that's be that was beyond me i mean
because that was like the first digital
power supply if you told me that you
could replace all the analog ICS and
power supply with a bunch of
microcontrollers I would say that sounds
absolutely nuts billion but the
engineers of course here pulled that off
I actually came in after that so you
know stuff like the SF series I was part
of that team and and of course the you
know the HX and the TX am everything
that you've seen launched in the last
couple years and and then of course you
know I always have to go back because
I'm like oh man I found you know found
this mistake this problems that back
refresh the product so that's why we
always you always see us with new
product every year there's a reason for
that because we're trying to try to be
everything to everybody and make
everybody happy so if somebody has one
little nitpicky complaint in a review
and a lot of people say well that's just
nitpicky it's my job to go back and fix
it for the next time around but that's
that's the thing yeah and that's what I
like about Corsair guys I've spoken to
him about little things that I didn't
like for instance the 460 X I didn't
really build some things I didn't like
about the case right and I've listened
to those fair that re refreshing that
and making things better so they listen
and they really yeah that's the cool
thing about the environment yeah of
course air you know we've got all the
different product managers they have
their own specific product they own they
own that product right so if they get
feedback they have you know they have to
they have to follow up right because
it's like that's their job their job is
like okay this is my baby now you're
insulting my baby yeah yeah you know so
is that you know you can't have a big
ego
right because you
have to be able to say crap you're right
I gotta fix this great you know whatever
you places coolers power supplies
whatever you know you have to have an
attitude that's a positive
everybody makes me yes oh no I make it
better people watching me for a long
time now how many mistakes I think I
make mistake every single day of my life
but people did I get a guy's in the
comments you are a mistake Brian okay
okay there's gonna be too far but uh so
we had some questions yes it's um which
suit is a best for an old net I say sue
is that one I just that's real casual
Australian in me what is it
sue instead of PSU oh dude that's cool
but I do know that Australians like to
abbreviate everything for breakfast
sunny after sunglasses yeah so I should
get used to that okay sue got it is away
if we have it here so which sue is best
all-round or not say which bought for a
budget right I guess a lot of people
buying a GTX 1060 are x5a and of course
you know where we are five six I could
tell you to buy the most expensive
Corsair power supply and I wouldn't that
would buy but the thing is and it and
the design of the sales figures show
that the rmx has been the proven most
size got very low very low failure rate
yeah it's only gold efficiency but like
I said it's you know you're talking two
percent difference and it has a zero rpm
oh that works really well because it
actually uses a microcontroller Corsairs
like I believe the only company that
makes desktop power supplies that uses a
microcontroller for the fan speeds well
so we can actually program the fan
profile in there what what RPM to start
at how to ramp up and stuff like that so
our MX is our least expensive unit that
uses the MCU for the fan controller
fully modular of course and now we have
the individually sleeve cables that we
sell separately you can customize the
colors and now we're shipping it in
white I'm sure you saw that the sweet
white ones and it comes with the white
cables too because the demand for that
was just so high we did a limited
edition of the RMI the arm 1000 I yeah
and they were all gone like in under a
day one and and then everybody was just
like oh my gosh I got to have this thing
so we did the rmx because it's more
mainstream so yeah so I would
say you know overall just the big best
bang for the buck I would say is the rmx
have the coolest a lawn
yeah okay yeah I use an arm i but that's
because I'm kind of geeky about wanting
to monitor power consumption voltages
and that is that is a good thing with
the digital link via USB - yeah yeah I
had I've got that's the problem at the
moment I'm having about three digital
Corsair products but only two USB
headers yeah yeah so I got to figure out
which one to hook up so yeah look at the
the lighting the light yeah the RGB
lighting a cooler and then the power
supply what I ended up having to do I
got a piece a USB card yeah plug
everything for that yeah we do have to
address one things a lot of my viewers
talk about the vs series yeah we have to
talk about the V Series now I get a lot
of people who they say it's crap I've
used the vs pounce blog had no problem
yeah the s550 is that it's a budget
entry-level battle supply yeah and for
me it's always done the job I use two of
them now and yet it builds yeah I mean
so you can you can say it's crap because
it is the least expensive corsair power
supply you can yet you can buy but we do
have to maintain a standard I mean you
see there are a lot of power supplies
out there that aren't even 80-plus
certified it might not even have active
PFC yeah because it's not required in
every country yeah um might not even
it's not required in this and it's not
required in Australia or the US right
and it's a you know in so yeah it's I
mean it's the least expensive it's
totally no-frills
um but it works you know it totally
works yeah it's not modular it's only a
sleeve bearing fan only has a three year
warranty you know there's reasons for
these things but you know if you got to
hit a certain price point then you know
there it is well yeah I mean I'm
especially consider 500 future watts is
actually a lot of power it is yeah it's
getting way overkill I mean unless
you're running SLI you most people die
anyway and if you're running that 550
watts of power arguably you'd have
expensive gear you wouldn't want to put
a via Skype to show on there anyway so
that was my argument for me is like okay
you're putting this with a 1060 or 580
and a mid-range CPU and that generally
those configurations will juice maybe
250 Watts when you're gaming right so
it's like that's well under the 550 watt
power supply is going to be sitting
there
yeah and that's why that's why I like
like the RMI series for example is
because you can actually get rot you
know actual data numbers that what would
you know what you're actually power
consumption is because even though you
can't see the link screen if you're
running benchmarks and stuff it does
have the login capability if you turn
that on and then it creates a
spreadsheet for you okay and then you
can pull the spreadsheet out and see
what your parish consumption was while
you were benchmarking and stuff like
well so I noticed some I noticed lately
I've been mafia 3 has been breaking the
the exact Crysis 3 was the game that
stressed the whole system at the most at
once and then yeah sure enough mafia 3
is now the king for me like family
effort for me I think the latest one I
found was a major power suck with
Witcher 3 which is 3 oh yeah but I'll
have to try mafia yeah definitely try
mafia so I think that's the way to do it
but we've got some questions arm yeah so
we got I think someone wants a how do
you measure ripple yeah you need
oscilloscope you need expensive gear and
well the oscilloscope doesn't
necessarily have to be expensive but
you'd have to measure it with a static
load otherwise it's just going to jump
all over the place oh yeah you would
need like a load tester which is
expensive that's the expensive person
okay now one more question I have is it
better to be under the voltage rating or
over it doesn't matter so like
throughout 11.9 versus 12.1 doesn't
matter because so what it is what you
want to look for is how much the
differentiation is from the low low to a
high load so if you're always under 12
volt but let's say your drop is like
eleven point eight to eleven point seven
nine yeah I'd rather have that than a
drop from twelve point three to twelve
point two right yeah I don't care if
it's above or below it because the thing
is is you're feeding that power is going
to power regulators on the motherboard
the graphics card it's going to it's got
a wide range capability to convert that
power down to what it needs to be
alright
so it's okay to feed it power with the
plus/minus of like five percent but the
thing is is you want to make sure that
that power is stable because as that
power fluctuates it takes those it takes
us FETs awhile to you know to cycle the
voltage where it needs to be you know
let me call it a bad analogy who's going
like the throttle
if it's not stable kind of thing the
Kazi yeah that's all kind of yeah you
want a nice light nice and smooth right
you know and and that's what you want
you don't want the sudden you know
spikes and drops and stuff because
that's going to hurt your components
down the line so what if you over Volvo
severely say you are like 12.7 or what I
have seen it before now a bad bounce fly
about twelve point seven on this woven
yeah it's that high that's not good
because like I said so you've got you've
got you know those components you're
feeding power to they have a tolerance
yeah right that's why the Intel spec
says you need to be plus minus 5 percent
so 11 point 6 volts to 12 point 4 volts
is where you want to be okay
no less no more um and so yeah so if
it's too high or too low the reason why
Intel defines that is because they know
if you're too high or too low that's
going to stress those components they
they're going to freak out because
they're like wow you know it's this more
voltage or less voltage than I can
handle and screws everything out so
you'll be making pop culture that's yeah
amongst your friends in detection yeah
we got some questions someone else about
EVGA b3 is that I don't know just asked
they said ask him about the EVGA b3 died
it's based off the super flower lead x2
sounds good
so I had a super cell pretty good and so
yeah this above there's a lot of good
pounce flies out oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
when it comes down to a lot of times is
you know what kind of support you know
if it's a brand name I mean I put that
out there too cuz I especially like in
Europe and there's some like totally
random brands I've never even heard of
the Apple they just so yeah cuz I seem
in the forms right it's like you know
hey I got this
you know Butch Cassidy brand power
supply what do you think of I'm like Oh
what did I did here I mostly if it's a
brand name it's like you you want to you
know do they have good support do they
have good warranty
yeah if you if you do get a 10 year
warranty or do you get a 1 year warranty
that you have to register oops I didn't
realize I forgot to register and I don't
have a 10 year old fashioned and then
they let it land and they're allowed to
advertise ten you want yeah yeah so
that's that's the kind of thing that
people need to look for when it comes
down to you know the bottom line and
also some you know support if you have
problems like you know some of they can
help you troubleshoot if you're having
any
show arm you know that it did you know
do they even have support they have a
phone number and you know stuff like
that's true as well so I've had it yeah
I had a young you get probably gonna
hate on me for this but I I am because I
deal with a lot of used power supplies i
spliced in wires and instead of fighting
those modules connected oh yeah so I
wouldn't have the gear at the time to
actually measure the voltage and great I
was in a rush and I'm like okay I'd be
splicing off the 24 pin to get the
solder connections and very very odd but
it did work I never have as it it's a
and it did work and it was very odd but
also on that note I did make my own
troubleshooted my own extra CPU
connector modular and took it from a
PCIe connection rewired it made it a CD
a reverse that yeah and in reap made a
CPU connection so I've never had
problems with hacking power supplies but
a lot of people don't even going to
electrocute myself but what's the best
way to when you're dealing with power
supplies what's the best way to if you
have to work on them what would be the
best way I've always the DC is not going
to hurt you right so I mean the only
thing that's going to really hurt you in
the power supply is that bulk capacitor
inside and so I mean just don't don't
you don't open it yeah I don't know
because you if that thing is charged up
and you open it up and you touch those
contacts on it you're dead it's 404 what
well it depends for 20 volt 440 volt and
I that you don't want mess with that but
and there has been people that have
gotten killed as I seen it is there's a
you to be of dude like going to shooting
back off where yeah you know what I mess
with that but the DC voltage now you'd
be lucky if you even felt a tingle okay
so basically just going to the wire but
to drain a power supply probably I've
always just turned it off from the wall
and then actually press the power button
yeah so you know yeah the best thing to
do you know and it's it's you know a lot
of times and this might be good
information yet for your viewers when
you when you turn off your PC and even
if you flip the switch on the back or
even unplug it right and you'll see that
the LED is still on on your motherboard
yeah okay that's just because the power
supply still charged up and then that
led if if you don't have much of a load
on there that led can stay lit for like
15 20 minutes I've seen it yeah
long time just sitting here like yeah
well one times I fast afford it was like
a good three minutes yeah and because
they had multiple LEDs yes staying on so
everybody freaking I was like oh my god
there's something wrong with my
motherboard no no it's the the power
spies doing what supposed to do it's
it's thick because the capacitor that
you want that capacitor stay charged
because if your power goes out yeah
the PSU it can actually keep running to
the power comes back on now we're not
talking like a blackout but like if your
power dips or something like that when
AC turns on in some old house and the
voltage goes down and stuff up so yes
you would keep the vacuum yeah with the
vacuum cleaner I remember yeah back and
cleaner air compress or anything
yeah with a motor yeah and when I was a
kid I had my cheap cheap computer mum
would turn on the vacuum computer back
and clean in the end their whole
computer to turn off right and so that
that's hold up that's what hold up times
four that's the whole thing about hold
up time and that hold of time that the
whole definition of the hold of time is
how much power can that that big cap in
the parents buy the bulk cap we call it
can hold a charge but that I like going
back to it it could also kill you I yeah
it has it's I guess it's a double-edged
sword right is if it's too much it can
is the inrush current it can no no no no
it doesn't affect well it it can't
affect the inrush current because if you
have no AC power going to the power
supply and you flip the switch on it or
surge protector yeah then then that's
going to cause a rush of current to
charge that cap right yeah so that in
itself could cause a problem it's really
rare though and if that causes a problem
because there should be the proper
circuitry in the parish play to prevent
that from being a problem but to go back
to yeah so what you want to do is I mean
like I said II you can you can have that
PSU turned on and plugged into a
motherboard for you know however many
minutes and that cap will still be
charged so the best thing to do is just
have a some kind of load on there fan a
hard drive you know something to just
drain that down yeah yeah just just have
a fan on like I've never thought of that
yeah just touch it and until it sits
until it's completely drained house plus
they're dangerous things guys don't know
what don't do what I do if you ever seen
my used budget builds don't do what I do
I'd be like Dre I drained the powers
wide open up not spray parts cleaner on
it clean it all down get all the dust
off yeah thing would work like brand new
sure and people tell me I want electric
humor so I was like as long as it's not
charged
how do you make sure the powers players
got not a single bit of current in there
so I mean if we talk about an LED being
lit for three hours and three minutes
sorry no 15 minutes like that that's
enough charged yeah yeah kill a human
being so yeah yeah because the charge
runs through your button have you uh
what's the worst story you've heard
about it from a guy in China I mean got
shocked and died he was he opened up his
power supply and I think but he was
really dumb about it though I think I'm
still plugged in as with the story Wow
so he probably got it from both you know
the the from the wall the cap everyday
you know he just completely messed up
but that is a that's a pretty weird one
but yeah but that it'll throw it at the
very least it'll throw your back yeah so
do not open up your power supply's guys
unless you seriously know what you're
doing so like or you just you know
there's you really know that it's at
what you really have to open up a power
you should well in early it's either
dead or you want it yeah if it's out of
warranty and the fan dies right you want
to replace the fan yeah you know and and
a lot of the really techie guys though
they'll do like full cap replacements on
Wow
so what's the with the cap sorry we
don't have V s550 with the caps right
you ran that thing 24/7 saved for
instance on a 300 watt load as a gamer
would on a vs 550 how long would it take
for those caps to get bigger and blow up
what would be the average outlook I
believe that's that's kind of it so we
do a cap life analysis on all the power
supplies that's pretty much how we
determine our warranty should be at
because there's a formula that you can
use based on data that you get from the
capacitor manufacturer that says if
you're running at this temperature 24/7
you know with this load or whatever this
is how long that caps going to last I
can write so so I did the easy answer
for V S series is going to be three
years threes okay it running 20 volts
24/7 full load yeah yeah and that's I
that's that's we have to determine it
24/7 folow because we don't know what
people are going to do with our power
supplies well and if guys if you're
playing on you can be to 24 hours a day
doing something and wrong like I win the
lottery and that's like all you have to
do now is just play the games all day
don't do a guy
eight hours a day max and even that's
pushing it when I was young I did the
big session sixteen Isles and World of
Warcraft
oh did you play what Walker no no I
sought to Warcraft to I couldn't get
into the dough yeah I'm glad I'm glad to
hear that but that game I'm more of a s
guy yes what games do you play like I'm
talking about the ocean over watches the
big one right now yeah yeah so what what
character do you play I just go all over
him
yeah yeah I mean I'm I like junk rat
yeah he's my favorite at the moment I
play a bit junk rat and you just run
around cuz he kind of let you get into
places that people camp and like do
their little Snipes and stuff and you
can kind of get in there without being
seen
yeah I'm looking for the quick champions
from finally like I was on the beta but
I could never get on the darn server
it's like oh yeah here here's the beta
program downloading i'm like i coul
fired up and say sorry can't give it
server has it okay and so what about
gila
what does Johnny Gerber use in terms of
monitor grab his car BP you my monitors
are actually pretty I've got the I've
got the Samsung 120 Hertz uh 20 what
does a 20 24 I got three of those oh
yeah boom hundred twenty huts so you
like the difference between 60 going up
from 68 yeah you can I think I think a
lot of gamers like people who play PC
games can tell I can tell ya and I've
tried the 240 Hertz recently yeah that
was crazy that was really crazy was
actually really not yeah so one of these
days I want to get like a curve monitor
those I don't want to end to Samsung to
see if SCIM nah I'm not gonna do it my
viewers know I talked about the Samsung
not too much but I do want although I
did see that Dell a K yeah yeah but do
you think though I think wouldn't
monitors Emma I think we cross it is
okay so but what about monitors though
how some of them have their power
supplies built-in they don't only juice
such little amount
yeah they don't they don't pull much
power so what's the usual bit like
minima so my Samsung's they all have the
internal power supply okay you get
plugged the power so it can be I hate
the power pricks sitting all over the
floor but you know you know funny thing
with monitors I find the actual display
outs die before the Pat light if a power
locally and why don't you know would you
know why the display ports which is done
I like it's really it's bizarre to me
because like I'd have a DVI port blow
out on the model and the HDMI works so
it's still ok but yeah I'm no idea I
mean I just you know what I do have some
idea because if I apply some of the
power supply knowledge and get to that I
mean there's things like like when you
have surface mount components we run
into this a lot with power supplies yeah
if they're mounted on both sides of the
PCB yeah right and you float it through
the wave solder but then you have to put
it in a jig and get it to assemble the
rest of the way you can actually crack
the components on the bottom but you
don't crack them so it's a complete
failure it's like it's like an
intermittent failure or it's going to
fail in a matter of time and when you
look at it under a microscope after you
take it apart and you'll see that just
that connection of a resistor or dye it
could be anything it's it's severed so
could that be where that oven fix could
fix it or not usually salt you actually
really sold a broken joins properly well
no actually uh so Jeremy is joining her
he he he does a lot of Bitcoin mining
okay and he's always frying graphics
cards but he just no he just throws them
in the oven heats him up yeah resolder
in the oven huh just in kitchen oven
yeah pulls him on they work Wow so it's
like all right man whatever but he's
actually he's done it before was I yeah
I mean I don't know the technique
properly I just shove it in the oven and
I've seen one time I saw okay you know
that you're the trad Orange I'm like
this is good too I come to the bit yeah
yeah but it does worry not all the time
but it does we're so so if it's dead
it's worth a shot
right cuz what do you want to make a
worse what do you have to lose I mean I
guess if the silicon's did which is a
difference yeah yeah if you walk the
silicon but you know what I mean I have
to tell you what the likelihood of the
actual silicon parts dying same with a
power supply right yeah is so rare I
mean when I see power supply failures
it's typically just parts that just yeah
what do you think they come apart you
know they did come off the PCB they did
separate from the PCB and stuff like
that
or they sure to another part because
they were not correctly you know
oriented or whatever because you know
it's not a fully automated process to
make these things yeah but you know you
do have they call the pick-and-place
machine it puts all
small parts in there and I have to go to
that wave solder and you know you try to
make sure you have a jig that holds
everything in place but it's not a
perfect process so what would be the kid
worst conditions versus the best
conditions like we're talking about
humidity maybe or a drier environment be
worse for cracking things I mean I don't
know these I just guess to make that a
more humid environment will actually
probably be better for your parts yeah
now I don't you know I don't think
humidity well so there there are
humidity ranges and you know and it's so
like if you go through one of our
technical documents you know they're
internal but I'm just saying if you did
there's a thing for you know altitude
requirement temperature humidity you
know and stuff like that
so as long as you're within those
parameters actually none of them have an
effect it really the thing is is was it
built right in the first place in the
first place that's all it comes down to
projections like the coating on the
piece no I mean I know I mean actually
you know the process of actually
building another design I mean obviously
the design is huge right you can slap
together you know the cheapest power
supply in the world yeah you know and
and then and then build it perfectly but
it's still a cheap crappy power supply
but I'm just saying even if you have a
fantastic power supply yeah and one
thing goes wrong during the assembly
process yeah you know three months six
months one year down the road
something can sell me something to fail
because like I said you can have just
like a tiny little break in the solder
yeah and you know gone and then of
course if you live near the ocean and
you leave your window oh god yeah no I
used to live in Florida
exactly back in the day when you know
you'd have a dim and it had the the the
gold contacts and the tin in the slot
and then the the corrosion would
literally well the memory into the
motherboard and it's just like oh my god
you know you can't even get the thing
out there you just seem a line of rust
lovely brutal is hard this is the one
more question I was going to go but I
had a brain flop so I completely forgot
but we can go to the viewers for some
questions on the time refresh so if you
guys have any questions for Johnny guru
then be sure to ask them I mean a lot of
these guys let's solve the use parts as
well
and parts of course but what's the most
actually because we're talking about the
290x or the the GTX 480 what was the
most single power-hungry card out there
because I think the 290x comes pretty
close yeah it's your boy Eddie a GTX 480
was pretty yeah 295x2 yeah that's uh
what uh what's the most power hungry
gravis car you know what it's funny so I
actually built a machine back in the day
God must man well to give you an idea I
would have to say probably 8800 GT X I
mean I know that's going way back but I
am i work for BFG yeah and I built a
machine with the sole purpose of
consuming as much power as possible so I
had the you remember the AMD bulldozer
no wait what does it called via not the
bulldozer shape all job I don't know as
a dual dual dual CPU board yet with two
gtx to to a 8800 GT X's yeah and I'd run
benchmarks on that thing and believe it
or not I would pull a thousand watts
from the wall Wow yeah it was crazy
let's you I've actually never seen a
thousand watts from the wall yeah is
crazy so it also get one more point let
the Bitcoin miners though they do it oh
yeah now with the the value of the
Bitcoin going up I am seeing high-power
power supplies flying out the door
because like the asic miners um you know
they used to be people use a six miners
because they're more efficient than
graphics cards a bla bla bla but now you
have a six miners that use 1600 watts
for one a six minor right so they've
gone through the roof Wow so remember
the Lokpal but they were low-power and
now the ones they're using now to really
mine art is you know 1667 watch for the
one minor so I hit people so people
mining other cryptocurrencies now with
the graphics cards yes yeah because you
can do yeah so like I was saying about
Jeremy and throwing his graphics card in
the ovens he does altcoin because he can
use the graphics cards it doesn't pay
for power so so he runs into the coal
ser office no no yeah he lives okay yeah
but yeah so he although we did do that
one um yeah um so yeah he does all coin
and yet
and he uses graphic squares for that and
he just recycles and you know so one
thing I am curious about there with
power supplies is there many people who
do DIY like they get all the components
and build the powers now that it knows
yes Cooper could you is there is there
something like for instance with a
chipset you of course you got something
holding you back like a multiple but
with say for instance a power supply
would there be things out if you could
get all the parts you can do and because
so the most like something like a
motherboard you have like a four layer
six layer board there's traces in
between stuff like that obviously a home
person can't build that right yeah but a
PSU PCB is typically only it's either
single site or double site at the most
yeah right at the most it's double sided
so yeah it's theoretically you could do
if you could if you could print if you
could print a PCB for it and make sure
you get all the right components yeah
you could do it yeah but it's it's the
thing is it's more time and money than
it's worth because yeah it had Naposki
so much darn money we'll have same
people building there are in keyboards
and I'm that's my initial reaction well
that'd be a big waste of time yes sir
yeah no I think it would be cooler to
just like mod you know Marta Parish play
like you know instead of K so we'll do
that like not not so much it's funny to
actually I would think that is fairly
you know that would be fairly common
practice I mean I see people the paint
and the stuff right but you know cut a
hole on the side put a window in it or
even you know like we're talking about
the the water-cooled ones before open it
up you know take the fan out put water
block of water blocks on top of the
heatsink you know do a bunch of holes in
the in the housing for for additional
airflow and yeah say hey look I just
made a water-cooled power supply here's
a very specific question so I'm like
we're gonna look through questions guys
sorry if I miss any we've just got I'm
on a laptop monitor so we've literally
got like a little screen for the stream
it is pretty it is pretty tiny but this
it has been really good laptop so is it
looks like a very specific question I
asked him about ask Johnny oh my god out
matter about module this fixed cables in
voltage variation or efficiency is that
as a good that is a good question yeah
so yeah so obviously any point of
connection is going to be an efficiency
drone right an efficiency drop you know
because you have that it's it's a it
adds resistance right
in the pins you know everybody's like oh
you know the gauge of the wire you know
the number of connectors the pins are
the the part that's actually the most
susceptible to high current right yeah
so when people do things like and it
just drives me up the wall they use
adaptors like like a like a molex to a
SATA adapter or something like that yeah
they're they're putting stress on those
pins I you know it doesn't matter what
the gauge of the wire is or that you've
made it like 50 feet long I don't care
yeah you're stressing the pins out so on
a modular power supply then that's like
10 times worse right because you have
the pins where the cable plugs into the
modular interface and they'll so that's
the point of where the most pals going
yeah yeah because everything that's
plugged into that cable yeah has to go
through that connector yeah right so you
know I I had a guy just last week asked
me he's like you know how many how many
hard drives platter drives can i plug in
you know can I do seven and I was like
how many how many connectors are on that
the cable now and he's like four I'm
like then four you know because because
you don't want to overload right and
with the pattern I can't speak for other
companies but we like Corsair for
example we choose the gauge of the wire
depending on how many connectors are on
there too so if we only have like a
couple connectors on there we can get
away with like an 18 gauge wire but if
we have like four or five connectors 16
gauge I'm sorry going backwards Nelson
yeah 14 H is a smaller number big one so
yeah so so the thing is so you don't
want to screw with that engineering and
say I'm going to start adding connectors
to is now you've just completely thrown
that that out the door cuz in a way I've
been a fan of semi modulars you gotta
have to have your twin yeah you gotta
have a 24 pen in the eight pin anyway
yeah and so I've been it so do you think
there's one of the semi modular designs
are kind of like the bad I guess but the
of both worlds like for the
perfectionist yeah yeah well I mean is
like obviously I mean it goes without
saying that that's going to be less
problematic than fully modular right
and fully modular is going to be
worst-case scenario because the
potential connectors to go lose that can
be the potential for the pins to fail
what I was talking about before and
obviously semi modular you don't you
won't have that problem okay
at least with the 24 pin in the EPS yeah
right I do like fully modular though
because you know
if I'm changing things on my PC a just
click lick lick lick lick just pull them
all out and then my Paris plays just a
box it is giving far so yeah so that's
true okay we'll go to the next question
so we got here so okay ask Johnny if
there any problems with wine with the RM
1000 I you know what actually in this
day and age every power supply is
susceptible to coil wine because they
have to have the to get the better
efficiency they have to lower the
switching frequency down to almost
audible level right and so if those
parts that are wound whether it be a
coil or transformer or even a poly
capacitor get the plastic if if they're
not made absolutely perfect this goes
back to where I'm saying which is like
perfection is impossible so you never
know what's going to happen down at the
end of the line we're not never but I
mean you hope that everything goes
perfectly that you know then you end up
with these vibrations yeah and those
vibrations cause audible noise yeah and
so you know at in the engineering
department you know we go when we attack
and we're like all right cool
everything's perfect and then six months
down the road
something happens because the capacitor
manufacturer the coil manufacturers well
dad they hired a new guy and he did
something wrong you know or he didn't
put enough you know the the lacquer on
the on the on the closure so I'm like
that and then boom all the sudden
somebody's complaining about coil whine
yeah you know that is a shift funny
thing with design sort of changing it's
not your fault
like as yeah I mean back in the day you
could have really high switching
frequencies that's why old pitches leave
earlier you know Henrik's patters play
from 20 years ago never made a noise I'm
like yeah but the efficiency was like
semi percent you know of the switching
frequency so high if it was making noise
you could have the you know the
crappiest parts in there you wouldn't
hear it you know so it's just you know
it's just technology getting ahead of
itself you know so we'll stop finishing
up the Q&amp;amp;A what are some this is I like
this question what are some good rules
of thumb when you're buying a used
palace floor you just buying a power
supply what's um just a general I mean
my would be stick to the solid reputable
brand
especially with a power supply there's
no room for is one of that is the one
component that if you have problems the
potential from a lot more grain right
yeah exactly so definitely don't get
don't get something that nobody's ever
heard of you know you can't find a
review for it there's a reason for that
is because the company that made it
never sent any units out for review and
and then and then the thing is like I
said the fan type if you if you want to
make sure if you don't want to have to
take the thing apart and replace the fan
right yeah if you know that it has like
a ball bearing fan or an FTD fan or some
like that
yeah like you know going back to what we
started with the the fan is going to be
the first thing that fails in power
supply so if it's a good fan then you
know that you're going to get some
mileage out that power supply even if
it's used see you behind in hosed yeah
yeah unfortunately though you can't tell
things if you're buying to use you can't
tell how hot the guy made it so that's
the thing because you know like if you
run it if you run a power supply and
extreme temperatures those caps are
going to bulge and but that's another
thing too is you take a flashlight shine
it in the grille have a look you can you
can tell when because you know they have
the vent cuts in them and they'll split
right and you might see a little bit of
electric lytic you know coming out of
top something so if you see that then
it's like much no don't don't buy that
one unless you know how to replace yeah
because that would be that would be
because of high temperatures because if
the power supply is not that old and the
fan still works but the capacitors are
bulging somebody ran that thing way too
hot yeah and so with that though with
that what's say for instance we got a
missile be my last question with a
refurb with a refurb alright when it's
something fails how likely is something
else going to be near failure because of
that original failure say captain blow
is obviously is that that's a good quite
so that's and that's a dangerous thing
too because so if you if you have a cap
that's that's completely bulged out but
but the power supply still works right
and you don't know it okay then that's
causing things down the line to not run
correctly the ripple could be like five
times what it should be and stuff like
that and that's when you end up with
power supplies that kill other parts
yeah and you're sitting there freaking
out going what's going on it powers and
that's the thing that bugs me about
power supplies is that people assume it
runs
works yeah but the thing is it's like it
runs and you could have just killed your
last three motherboards like I can't
figure out what's going on I'll just
keep replacing my motherboard hey maybe
it's your power supply it's killing
everything I used to do tech support
used to be a manager in RM a department
yeah and we have people too I mean the
whole reason I started joining guru.com
was I was in an army department for
Annie Taylor and there was this guy who
bought all his parts from us except for
the power supplies because he thought
our power supplies were too expensive
and and what it was was he he'd returned
all the parts after a year and they'd
all be dead and you know and then it's
like dude bringing the whole build let's
check it out and it was some power
supply never even heard of it weighed
like nothing it was just this flimsy
steel housing not even painted no sleeve
cables just the cheapest thing you could
buy right and I'm like okay well I think
this might be the probably goes no no it
powers on it's fine everything powers on
it's not the power supply and so then I
found a guy in the industry who had a
load tester and we put it on there and
we hooked up an oscilloscope to it and
the ripples and me a hundred you know a
rollercoaster
oh yeah and I was like - yeah see and I
was like nobody does this like reviews
and stuff so then I'm like how much can
i buy this thing for and I bought all
the kit and and that was it so yeah so
yeah I've always inspired to try and
review power supplies but it looks is it
time consuming like it would be well is
the time consuming part is actually
running all the tests yet for X number
time I mean if you want to be thorough
you want to do like me you know like we
do ten tests at Johnny guru.com cold and
hot so it's 20 tests total you're going
to want to run it for X number of
minutes per test so yeah it can be
time-consuming okay are you one more
question one more than I've actually cuz
I got in here guys I want to ask so many
questions is I want to get refreshes if
we've got there's fun so maybe it's time
did last question final question no no
no it's if we got say for instance 100
volts it means yeah 100 or so 100 volt
from the wall yeah versus 240 NS tray
which would be better for a power supply
or other thing the 240 did the 240 okay
why is that because you know higher
voltage lower current or current load
less Heat
yeah right so yeah so so those parts on
the primary side
yeah they're all gonna run cooler
because they have less current yeah
right going through it that's because
I've always looked at the house while
using so different numbers and yeah
really I never started really physically
yeah so if you if you actually yeah so
if you actually test the same power
supply same loads yeah but with 115
input versus say 230 or 240 mm boy
you're gonna find that the 230 240
inputs always a lot more efficient so
the Australian is better than run belies
in Australia yeah well America America
is worse because they were the first
with the electricity right so they just
made a bad decision right from the start
and never changed there is a country
that runs which goes around to ATS a to
a tivo about 280 Japan's 100 that's
that's hard yeah that's hard on a power
splay it really is and I mean there's
some times where you just have a Paris
plane you don't even want in Japan yeah
yeah that's that's that's why I know
those the deltas are pretty good well
exactly I mean so like the only way you
can sell a power supply in Japan is if
it's a really good power supply because
they have only a hundred volt mains it's
like whose idea was that
and it's yeah I didn't change him for a
long very archaic country in ways did I
live this anyway guys thank you guys for
tuning in
we had Johnny Carew and he was um it was
very good to having you on man so this
fun yes I just want to make sure that
sorry if we missed the questions guys
Johnny's obviously only taken a little
bit of time out to do a live stream and
thank you so much because I was really
when Corsair said i do you want to
interview anyone from Corsair i found
out yeah yeah I want to interview Johnny
girls I just grew up reading those
reviews and laughing my ass off while we
gotta keep the readers reading so yeah
but while I was getting educated and
that is the other thing too is we want
to make sure that our spies can be
really complicated but we want to make
it where people could understand it
and that's that's just where I learn
assess with arian sort of like the
respect and love from the community
comes so close and man so thanks a lot
yeah well for your time dude and yeah
guys we'll catch you guys and of course
it there's some really dying questions I
did tweet out on Twitter yeah did but
you don't want masked people following
you I don't know what did reach I that
you can ask Johnny oh yeah you should
