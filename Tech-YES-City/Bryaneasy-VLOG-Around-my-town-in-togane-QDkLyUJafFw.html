today with a back again today with a
video just going around my city showing
you guys what tall Ghana is like cuz i
got a request i got a request to show
what my city was like so I'm just here i
am just quickly going to give you guys a
peek of what is in my city so i don't
know that one of my videos I also showed
don quijote I just kinda like the other
side of my looks like he's in my city
that's only the other side of my city
this is unlike the train station around
the kind of main center of tour gonna so
as you can see the place is really it's
a really nice city it's populations
about 65,000 it is a nice it is a nice
City I do like it here mind you I came
from a bigger sort of like I came from a
real big city and that was cashew oh
that was ten times the size of this
place so they had a lot more there as I
said in one of my other vlogs if you
were coming to Japan your you know male
or female and you are single i'd
recommend the city but if you if you've
got a girlfriend or a boyfriend vice
versa you know and um you got a kid
especially we got a kid i recommend the
country over the big city so it's kind
of really relaxed here see how is not
crowded at all you know this is just a
normal weekday and it's not crowded at
all which i love i love free sort of
free air kind of thing so it's really
hot today so i'm not in the most
enthusiastic mood so yeah hey guys is
why i like the country it's nice and
peaceful so she can ride around and so
to show you guys some stuff sir
we've got tax knees and this is kind of
the other side of stations is a big
bridge there and I got my push bike so I
am NOT going to go over that bridge
unfortunately but i will go around the
other side okay so here's the other side
of the station so more taxis a lot more
sort of there she trains and stuff like
that so
then you got your drink vending machine
which I like in summer huh they come in
handy so let's go check out a little bit
more so wrote a big intersection now
there's a train crossing there across
the road there's a family mark can't
really sit here and over there as we get
closer we will see my heishi son dentist
okay as we're approaching we come to a
sudden halt and some real nice new
houses here and my favorite is my
favorite dentist such a cool place i
recommend this place she want to eat a
stun very professional he's fix my teeth
two times now so he's a cool guy fix my
brothers teeth he's fixed brothers
friends teeth he's fixed and teeth this
guy I'll tell you now he's he's a
perpetual tooth fixer so they get like I
hate the different family restaurants
like Jonathan's
alchy they got a men's suit store in a
petrol station just they're looking for
a house there's a home place right there
over there is a DVD still write the back
I'll get a closer look at that later see
that's just around this little part here
more choices of restaurants sighs area
they're just like an Italian restaurant
a pretty good foot heart occasionally
there but there's my favorite Guster I
love them like for a family restaurant
they're awesome they are they actually
stop the Guster burger recently which is
a pain in the ass cuz i love that a it's
like six bucks for burger and chips cm
across the road they got booked off and
a d2 hardware store so there's just in
like a real place for sanity it probably
like 200 meters universes that it's not
bad for our country town and here's my
bike I still we're still cruising
through the city son all right get more
footage another restaurant that's some
special place
I'm really ate there actually to be
honest dennys hey dad wants karaoke bar
he was also a strip bar over there if
you're into that kind of thing car
dealership right here Suzuki see ya got
lots of cool stuff here so start heading
into the city centre the post is like a
big post office they're open till eight
o'clock at night so it's pretty cool
cross the road more strip bars and like
karaoke and restaurants now they're kind
of like the drinking bars I think like
you go drinking with your friends their
shop yeah so it's pretty hot today so I
don't sound too enthusiastic sorry about
that it's like it's real soon that's
right in the summertime that's like even
though it's not hot it's sort of like
really humid sir you know like well sort
of dying outside here yeah I'll get more
footage while as we go up ahead so this
here is like the big shopping mall in
tour Guarnere kind of thing there's also
another big Don Quijote
it's like sorta like the opposite side
of the city this is kind of like the
place that's right near the train
station there's a restaurants and
there's sort of a supermarket in there
there's no need a movie theater with a
net screen like all the real good movies
they screen all this sort of second-rate
movies but don't tell anyone I said that
you know because I love this place I do
love tall guy there's a really nice park
across the road and yeah so there's a
station back where we just came from
that way so yeah I'd say if you guys
want me to check out inside I will make
another video on another day this is so
freaking hot today so I want to go home
dear calm and chill hey here's like the
community center in my town when there
was the big earthquake every year ago
this was like the little at the
emergency center stack uation point I
was really crowded I remember that so
cold to that day so but here is the real
big park this is where you know I take
my kids sometimes for a walk it's very
very big nice nice open park with all
like that monkey bars and slides and
stuff and ropes so it's really cool so
there's over they'll see if i'll show
you the guys the drug store they call it
a drug store in japan so it's actually
just like a chemist's you know sir let's
have a look there this is kind of like
here's the sims this is one of the many
drug stores into organic chemists so
they just sell like they sell a lot of
different things like compared to
Australian chemists they sell milk and
bread and sort of some staple items but
they also sell a lot of other things
like toilet paper and hair products and
shampoos and even baby food too but then
across the road you got the baby store
so I've actually bought a few things
from here so I kind of come here a lot
so that I do come here sometimes
and basically guys that's about like you
know that's my city and sort of like a
quick bike ride probably 2k ride like 1k
there 1k back it's you know it's a lot
like basically in a nutshell to sum up a
place like mine with a population of you
know 65,000 my city how's it compared or
biggest city for instance Tiger nervous
casual in a nutshell you've got
everything that the big city would have
minus a few niche stores you got all
your you know real big stores your big
chain stores or supermarkets you don't
have your nightlife so being in the
country you kind of don't have your
nightlife and you got more infrequent
trains but as opposed to the city the
the benefits are that you do have more
you know the rents cheaper here
definitely and it's a lot more peaceful
and groceries and all your everyday
items living costs are a lot lower
compared to the city too so that's
something to take into account and
overall yet so get you some really you
know i love the putt country it's very
peaceful and people are kind of more
down-to-earth here you know people are
more like I guess has less selfish maybe
yes in general like as you know it's you
know of course people in this city are
gonna be selfish but you know like sorta
like there's no I don't know how to say
it I yourselves the wrong word so that
people just a more relaxed here I guess
not as busy or stressed out maybe yes
they might come across a selfish
stressed out and busy I don't know sort
of I'm just hot and sweaty so I really
didn't know what I'm saying at the
moment so yeah guys if you've got any
comments um put them in the comments
