with the GTX 10 atti being a grabs card
that is pretty much desired by any gamer
if you do or don't have it however last
year I did pick up two GTX 690 s and I
got them for a very good price and SLI
being something that is not popular
nowadays I decided to put them together
to make what would technically be quite
SLI so essentially a GTX 690 is two gtx
680 dies on one PCB and when you put two
of them together you technically have
Quad SLI or for GPU dies running in sync
to play your games though the problems
with running an SLI configuration are
well documented with blue screens
happening a lot of the time that's even
in a dual card configuration here we
have four GPUs running in sync and the
problems were quite bad that was so bad
to the point where I didn't even dare
try to use shadow player and he captures
when I was running these tests because I
was already getting chronic blue
screening in a lot of the games so
getting these results here I did manage
to run benchmarks however in normal
operation I would not recommend anyone
run Quad SLI just for the sake of not
losing your sanity though all problems
aside the max potential of this
configuration is actually quite
impressive with the initial firestrike
score showing that of something that is
coming close to the 1080 TI now keep in
mind you do have a 4 gigabyte vram
buffer on one of these cards coupled
together you have a gigabytes in total
however only two gigabytes is usable in
practically any game out there and so
that does create a limitation on the
potential of these grabs cards not to
mention the games the drivers and also
everything in between
does limit these cards quite a lot
however I decided to pick out a few
games that did support what SLI and the
results will show that it is indeed just
like that 5 strikes score coming close
to the potential of a 1080 Ti so let's
take a look at how well these two gtx
690 s fare in some of these titles
welcome back to take yesterday's Brian
coming to you guys today with that video
on these two gtx 690 s now I did
configure this on a z3 70 motherboard
within 8700 K o'clock to 5 gigahertz so
the CPU on that side of things is not
going to limit the potential of these
cards at all even at 1080p gaming of
course we have the 1080 TI from EVGA
this is a beast of a graphics card it's
actually overclocked out of the factory
and considering the overclocks I didn't
decide to touch any of the other clocks
especially on the 6 90s where they're
already getting very hot out of the
factory even on a hundred percent fan
speeds I was seeing mid 80 degree
temperatures on the stock clocks so I
decided not to overclock anything and
the power consumption it even confused
my water meter where the point where was
like saying it was around 400 watts in
the flash strike combined test but I
know that's complete crap it'd be
anywhere from around nine hundred to a
thousand watts now I did test this with
a 1000 watt rmx power supply from
Corsair so the power supply was okay in
handling these tests but besides that
mammoth fire strike score I did manage
to find a few games especially the first
one we're pulling up here Crysis 3 that
did showcase the true potential of these
grabs cards Crysis 3 is a game that is a
couple of years old now however it was
scaling over 90% a lot of the times this
was at 1080p with the settings virtually
maxed out and the vram buffer was
holding up quite well in this game and
the frame rates were kind of actually
impressive we were getting around 122
fps on average with the point one
percent lows actually not being low at
all we're getting over ninety FPS on
those point one percent Louis contrast
that to the 1080 TI of course this was a
beast of a Grammy Scott scoring 177
average fps and 0.1% low of a hundred
and sixty-one so it was a very
impressive showcase from the GTX 1080 Ti
however the GTX 690 s were putting on
quite a show in Crysis 3 and the results
continued over to battlefield one where
at 1080p high settings I decided to test
the minigun scene which was pretty
consistent and
getting an average of around 120 FPS
where the 0.1% low that was still above
80 FPS so quite an impressive feat in
battlefield 1 to keep in mind Crysis 3
and battlefield 1 a games that are very
well optimized for PC contrasting that
to the 1080 Ti we saw this thing was
near 200 FPS a lot of the times with a
point one percent low that was still
extremely impressive so both these two
games that I've shown you here the GTX
690 s did do very well and there was
really no noticeable stuttering at all
however after these two titles things
did start to take a turn for the worst
moving on to Metro last light a game
which I thought supported Quad SLI
really well actually didn't turning this
on dx11 showed an average FPS of 73 with
the minimum of 24 however when we moved
out of DX 10 we could then inject MSI
Afterburner and see what was going on we
had scaling here there was around about
50 to 60 percent on only three cards the
fourth card was just sitting there doing
nothing the DX 10 results did give a
better result of 95 average FPS with a
minimum of 29 comparing that to the 1080
Ti that's got 204 average FPS with a
minimum of 33 so it did do very well in
Metroid last like probably that minimum
is due to a CPU intense scene as he saw
the minimums compared to the 1080i quite
well there really for what it's worth it
wasn't that bad of experience on the 6
90s the one we moved over to Tomb Raider
this was the one that shocked me the
most yes the cards were all working and
on dx11 we were getting scaling around
about 35% the dips were absolutely
horrible in this game we scored 44
average FPS at 1080p high settings with
a minimum of 4 fps going over to the
1080i that did 173 and 65 minimum I even
had shadow play recording on the 1080 Ti
so this one was a clear fail for the 6
90s moving over to DX 12 on this game it
was even worse I've never seen this in a
game things were just coming in and out
and just blinking it was just a horrible
experience though the scaling did seem
to do a little bit better at
though for what it's worth the vram
buffer I think was limiting in this
title but as well as just the bad
optimization for Quad SLI and you can't
really put that on the game developer
because I don't think anyone really
wants to use Quad SLI in this day and
age they're now moving on to an
interesting title GTA 5 I thought this
was relatively uh knocked my for PC
especially compared to some of the other
titles I've talked about but it really
surprised me we're getting over 80%
scaling in Grand Theft Auto 5 and that
was across all four cards on high
settings at 1080p it was a really smooth
experience I was shocked we're getting
140 average FPS within point 1 percent
low of 131 this is when I test around
the section where I just walk along the
highway though when I did jump in the
car and start driving around the city
there was some pretty bad stuttering
however ironically enough that was still
present on the 1080 TI there were some
stutters there and that's due to the
game I think braking apparently when
you've got too high of an FPS figure now
of course I couldn't really up any of
the settings because once we start going
over that 2 gigabyte vram limit things
just start choking out an example of
this of course is pub G even at 1080p
where the settings are shocking though
we'll get onto that a little bit later
but GTA 5 it was a really good
experience one that I could actually
play on GTX 690 s in Quad SLI and still
have a really good time however what
about a more modern title well I decided
to test destiny 2 which I can't
unfortunately inject my river tuna or
MSI Afterburner into so I can't really
see what's going on live but looking at
the average FPS here which is a decent
indicator of how well the performance or
coupled that with my eyes and seeing
what's going on destiny 2 actually
played really well on two of these
graphics cards because after I loaded up
afterburner after the fact I could see
that only two GPUs were supported in
destiny 2 but it was still a very smooth
experience the average FPS in this game
was going well over a hundred FPS and it
was around about a hundred and 60
average fps in this title this was at
1080p high settings stepping this up to
4k surprisingly still gave us
decent experience on this 690 where
we're getting close to 60 FPS at 4k so
it was still playable and the stuttering
and dips there was practically none at
1080p though at 4k it really did start
having some problems I did start seeing
some kind of flickering and crazy
behavior on the six 90s of course the
1080 TI being a fantastic experience
that was pretty much pegged at 200 FPS
at 1080p which is the max limit on this
game and then a 4k we're still getting
over a hundred FPS at practically all
times so great experience on the 1080 HD
a decent experience at 1080p on the 690
s 4k I wouldn't recommend them all the
last title we're gonna pull up here now
is pub G and this really shows why Quad
SLI is not favorable at all in
modern-day titles only one graphics card
is supported in this game and it ran
terrible on the 690 or at least the 680
because that's essentially what it is
now in this game with the 2 gigabyte
variant buffer this was a 1080p medium
settings and we were just joking we were
getting point one percent lows that
we're hitting zero fps it was just
unplayable on this resolution which
1080p should be playable on a 680 with
just the two gigabyte vram buffer even
on medium settings it should be fine but
it's not fine on the 690 so something
clearly was going wrong with this game
the optimization was just terrible the
good thing was at least I didn't blue
screen however contrasting that to the
1080 TI that was scoring near 144 FPS at
most times the point one percent lows
were above a hundred and I couldn't
figure out now with this game how to
break that 144 Hertz cap I think with
the new version they've implemented a
locked mechanism so if you guys know how
to break that limit in the new version
of pop G then please let us know in the
comment section below but any guys when
it comes down to it if you want to do
SLI I would recommend getting cards with
a bigger vram buffer like for instance
if you're going with the GTX 770 and you
want to do two of them in SLI perhaps
think about getting two 770's with the 4
gigabyte vram buffer that will actually
give you a decent experience a lot of
the titles will support two cards four
cards however I just really isn't
happening and there's only a few games
that will support Quad SLI and even then
it's
a really hard time getting him to work
properly you do have to tweak the
settings and you do have to make sure
that your car's not gonna crash out not
to mention you will need a beastly power
supply so if what it's worth in 2018 I
wouldn't go for anything more than two
graphics cards though this six 90s did
put on a very impressive display I was
kind of shocked with the max potential
of these cards the fire strike score
really showed that it was coming close
to that 1080i it was really just let
down by its own two gigabyte vm buffer
and of course the games and drivers not
being optimized a lot of the times for
Quad SLI and now here's another thing
that I'm gonna talk about before I get
on out of here
when I put these cards in after the
1080i things worked well but when I put
my 1070 TI back in and started to try
and edit videos I was still copying a
lot of blue screens and yes I did ddu I
did reinstall the drivers again but
things are just still crashing and
they're still terrible so I will
probably have to reinstall my whole
system because there's just reg edits
that have happened and they've just
messed up this whole system especially
when it comes to Adobe Premiere Pro and
video editing I'm getting blue screens
in that and that's making video editing
very tough so if you want to go with
Quad SLI be warned you should expect
some headaches as well when I was doing
this testing I had to put the monitor at
1080p and cut off the second monitor so
I only had it with one monitor I found
that kept things relatively stable but
yeah in 2018 Quad SLI is pretty much a
no-no but one GTX 690 should do really
well in a lot of titles providing you
account for that - you could buy a VRAM
buffer even though it's got four
gigabytes you're gonna be having that
because it's got to GPU dies on the PCB
I knew guys in closing out I'm sorry it
took so long to get this video done I
did make a previous video a story
telling about the problems I faced
getting these things installed and also
ironically enough when I was trying to
get things working my motherboard had
some problems of its own which was
unrelated to the graphics cards itself
so yeah it was just a nightmare getting
this actual testing done but I'm glad I
did get it done because people can see
that
the hardware is being limited by a lot
of the time to the games a lot of the
games in 2018 some of the times they
just horribly unoptimized take for
example pub G I'm sorry to say as fun as
that game is it is terribly optimized
the Xbox and the consoles are really a
testament to how bad things can get when
a game is not properly optimized but
ultimately with these two gtx 690 s for
some reason i don't know what it is I
just love these cards I don't want to
let them go I don't even want to put
them in a build and sell them I think
they're gonna go up on the shelves and
just be placeholders because I just love
the look of them and they're just such a
cool card I think they were the last
geforce card where nvidia did the two
dies on one PCB yes there was the titan
z but the titan series has never really
been for gamers in general these were
sort of those cards that did have that
option of being really cool at the time
which is kind of an oxymoron I meant
like cool like is in the look of them
and also the fact that they were like
two gtx 680 s but i did pick these two
cards up for an absolute bargain so i
guess that's where these sentimental
attachments coming from they kind of
remind me you just got to keep hustling
and get them deals if you were to go out
and buy one of these on ebay they are
overpriced in my opinion and of course
they're not really that good as a
dedicated graphics card especially for
the price there's much better options
out there so yeah I don't know what it
is about these cards I guess people just
want to get one and create a sentimental
attachment to them - of course they did
have that mod if you're into soldiering
where you could essentially turn it into
a Quadro card which is much more
expensive than the 690 and then you
would be using it in the professional
field and getting really good
performance out of these things
especially if you're like a CAD editor
or you're into 3d editing so I guess
that's where the price of these things
come up as well as the fact that they
could be used in Mac if you were into
flashing them as well so good card but
ultimately in Quad SLI not really
something that I'd recommend or actually
something that I would stay away from
with a 10-foot Pole anyway guys hope you
enjoyed today's video if you didn't be
sure to hit that like button let me know
in the comment section below if there's
any of those broken promises that you
want to get pushed up to the top
q and I'll make it happen for you guys
and I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now
