welcome back to tech yet city this is
brian coming to you guys today with the
cpu gaming showdown and how many cause
do you actually need when it comes to
playing some of the latest titles and
also is it better to have lesser cause
and higher clock speeds as opposed to
more cores and lower clock speeds let's
find out now quickly going through the
contestants we have the 6600 K this is a
four core 4/3 + CPU we've got this at
4.6 gigahertz then we've also got the
3930k which is 6 cores 12 threads got
this to 4.4 gigahertz then we have the
e5 26:58 v3 which is a has load 12 core
24 threaded beast this thing I managed
to get this to 2.6 gigahertz on all
cores then lastly in the background here
we have my dual a 526 70 rig which
sports 16 cores 32 threads and they all
go up to 3 gigahertz now moving on
straight into the benchmarks I did have
all four of these test systems under the
980ti and I decided to drop the settings
down to 1440p high with no anti-aliasing
and what this allowed me to do was it
allowed me to stress the CPUs more so
than if I had the settings at 4k ultra
which would be stressing the GPU more
and what we found in the first game here
just calls 3 there wasn't really any
huge difference to note except the 6600
K did come in first at 118 average FPS
as opposed to the dual Xeon rig which
actually came in the last place however
it still scored over a hundred FPS
average there however moving on to the
GTA 5 it painted a completely different
picture with problems starting before we
even booted the game on the jewel Xeon
rig and we actually had to disable one
of the CPUs to get this game working
however once I got the game booted up it
came in noticeably lower than the other
three contestants and this was quite
surprising since the haswell-e 526 58 v3
is clocked even lower than the dual Xeon
setup now moving on into project cars we
see this trend continuing with the e5
26:58 which has clocked lower actually
beating out the dual Xeon setup however
this time around we didn't have any boot
problems and then moving on into the
last benchmark I just did this for a bit
of fun on the side of the dropsies go
all the way down to 720p low settings
just to stress those CPUs and what we
found was that all the CPUs performed
really well in this game and I was quite
surprised since this game is the oldest
of all 4 games that I tested so there we
have it the results are pretty
conclusive if you are a hardcore gamer
than you will generally want to go with
a single CPU setup however for someone
like me a content creator I'm only
looking for around 60 FPS average which
the dual Seon set up in the background
scored over that in every single game
that I tested so I'm actually quite
happy with that and even those minimums
didn't drop below 60 on any 4 of these
games which impressed me a lot on all 4
of the CPUs though it was a bit
confusing as to why the lower clocked 12
core 24 thread CPU was actually
dominating the duel see on setup I'll
have to look into that a little bit more
though it does seem that dual CPU setups
are not really designed for gaming that
should come as no surprise since they
are designed for workstation and
productivity although one thing I will
add if you are a competitive gamer or
you're 144 Hertz gamers and you'll
probably want to go with the latest and
greatest IPC like skylake even though in
my opinion that doesn't represent the
best value for money it still did
perform the best in the benchmarks but
was impressive to see the 3930k scoring
quite close to the 6600 K and actually
doing better in productivity which is
something that I really like and
something that I've been eyeing off
lately and especially since I've already
known xeon e5 2650 i'm gonna see if i
can get this thing to 5 gigahertz and
maybe revisit these benchmarks for you
guys is it too late now to say I'm sorry
I'm missing more than just your bad
we're gonna be clover clocking their
