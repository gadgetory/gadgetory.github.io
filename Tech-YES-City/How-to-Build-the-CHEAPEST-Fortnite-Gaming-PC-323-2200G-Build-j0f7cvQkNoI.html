components going in this 323 dollar PC
and more importantly can it play those
competitive multiplayer titles like
fortnight and csgo and dota 2 at 1080p
let's find out
welcome back to check yet city and first
off we have here an APU from AMD this is
the Rison 320 200 G 4 cores 4 threads
comes with an included cooler and it
costs 95 bucks now it's also got a
graphics portion built-in which were
also going to be utilizing today now a
good thing about this CPU and GPU hybrid
is that if you wish to upgrade your
graphics in the future at least with
this build you'll have some Headroom to
just drop a graphics card in something
like a GTX 1060 and then you'll get much
better graphical performance when you
have the extra budget to afford it so 95
dollars pretty damn good value for money
next up we've got the motherboard to
support this APU and that is the Rison a
320 micro ATX motherboard comes in at
$48 now the good thing about this
motherboard at least if you buy it from
Newegg is that it comes Rison mm ready
and so what this means is that they've
updated the BIOS so you have no issues
if you install this apu from the get-go
so if you do buy a motherboard like this
make sure it's writes in 2000 series
ready otherwise you could have some
issues where your computer might not
boot up at all because it might not have
the BIOS update needed to do that next
up the biggest one of this build the
biggest pain I guess ddr4 memory I've
got here 2 4 gig sticks of HyperX memory
from Kingston now you can use any 2 4
gigabyte sticks and in fact I do
recommend it the cheapest I could find 2
4 gigabyte sticks is $80 so Ram has
seemed to calm down a little bit in
price it still is overpriced of course
but we are able to at least with this
build take a detour from the GPU prices
on the crypto mining boom so we don't
have to worry about that with the APU so
we're really only paying a $30 premium
with this ddr4 memory compared to
historical prices which doesn't make it
too painful but next up here we've got a
1 terabyte hard drive from Seagate you
can use the Western Digital version if
you wanted there around the same price
$45 lots of storage of course if you've
got a bit of extra money may wish to
step it up to an SSD now for the last
two components the case and powers play
I've picked out two real budget-friendly
value orientated picks here first up the
case from Roseville $25 will fit all
these components in and then next up the
power supply 400
but from EVGA it's got actually a good
amount of power available especially for
a four core build like this and you've
still got ample room extra if you want
to add in a mid-range graphics card like
a GTX 1060 in the future but now that
leaves us with a total of three hundred
and twenty three US dollars believe
that's delivered to your door as well so
you don't have to worry about any extra
shipping costs and also if you're in
astray it will set you back four hundred
and fifty-one Australian dollars so what
are we waiting for
let's build this thing
so we actually try booting it up before
and it doesn't have the latest bios and
so this is the problem you gonna run
into so had to pull out the 2200 G and
insert a risin 3 1200 which was a first
series rise in CPU and then we can
insert the USB stick update the BIOS and
then we should be good to go with the
CPU so that was a little saying in the
intro really important to make sure if
you buy this motherboard you don't want
to do this to make sure that your rising
3 series motherboard is rising
2000-series ready at least in the advert
or printed on the box so after you've
got the APU installed the next step is
to in this case our XMP profiles didn't
really do anything it just loads up a
2133 profile so you want to change that
to I mean you can try and go higher if
you can but a 29 33 megahertz speed on
the memory will be really good for this
memory overclock because since the apu
utilizes the actual ddr4 memory instead
of having a dedicated graphics card with
its own vram on board so we can go into
the timings and then we can drop them as
well these timings here you can just
copy my settings if you want to because
this is really just all before it's
really budget orientated memory and it
and so it needs the timings loosened and
of course needs more voltage and after
we save &amp;amp; exit' that we should be good
to go with the games
so there it all is ladies and gentlemen
with this budget $323 pc we could get up
and play fortnight at 60fps at 1080p
with a hundred-percent screen scale -
also went over to dota2 and csgo so if
you're into playing those with your
friends you can definitely do that with
this apu was getting over a hundred FPS
on both those titles and it was a really
good experience one that I can enjoy now
two things to talk about before we get
on out of here as well this is a low
powered consuming build so I was reading
about a hundred and ten watts max from
the wall this is really good power
consumption if you want to play games
for a long time and from what I read
apparently the average person at least
in Australia where I'm from spends over
five hours a day on the internet so that
could be some power savings over time
here we've got the a320 as well we got
to talk about this little motherboard
here because it doesn't have a whole lot
of room for upgrading yes we can add in
a better graphics card with this build
and will get much better FPS if you want
to step up your settings in your games
or even step it up to 1440p however
there's only two DIMM slots on this
motherboard so you will have to if you
want to upgrade your memory to sixteen
gigabyte you either have to change two
to eight gigabyte sticks or get a
motherboard that has four dimm slots
which I would recommend out laying a few
extra dollars if you could to get a be
350 motherboard with those extra DIMM
slots however one very important factors
just saw Midway with this video was that
this needed a BIOS update because I
bought this from an Australian retailer
they didn't say it was 2000 series ready
so you may have some big headaches on
your hand if you buy this motherboard
and it doesn't say it's 2000 series
ready and you buy yourself a Rison 3
2000 series apu of course you can get
around this if you do come into this
problem m.d. will send you out a what
they call a BIOS upgrade kit however I
imagine if it's your first time building
a PC then the BIOS update itself could
be a scary thing however there are a lot
of tutorials out there especially from
the manufacturers of the motherboards
themselves they have their own tutorials
on how you can update your boss so
nowadays with YouTube and video
tutorials existing
it's not too much of a problem but you
may be out of gaming for a few days and
it especially sucks if you come into
this problem and you're really dying to
play games with your friends and you
just bought this piece in you're like
okay everything's here and I can't play
it because of a BIOS update that is
needed on this motherboard but anyway
with that aside let me know what you
guys think in the comments section below
about this little gaming PC here I mean
I think for the money
it's really hitting hard especially if
you just want to get into PC gaming play
those titles that a lot of your friends
are playing those competitive
multiplayer titles and you don't really
care too much about graphical settings
of course we're still good as I said
before those options to upgrade the PC
if you wish you've got that there for
the future when you get some more money
but this for 323 bucks absolute bargain
and if you want better price performance
than this then you may have to sacrifice
that new warranty on these parts and go
with a used price performance bill which
I do here on the channel quite regularly
so if you want to see that make sure you
hit that sub button and click the
notification bell and turn that on and
if you enjoyed this video be sure to hit
that like button of course you could
just spend some more money go with like
a $700 build and you'd have better
performance too but that costs more
money anyway catch you in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye
Stan gigabytes you'll either have to
change - ooh - ooh ooh
also RAM overclocking as well it's super
important also overclocking your memory
- if you saw what I did mid roll with
the memory you might want to do the same
it does help with the performance so
there it is ladies and gentlemen the
super-easy budget PC so there it is lady
but we are able to circumnavigate that
GPU pricing fix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
