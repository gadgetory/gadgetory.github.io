memory and that's not cheaper NAND flash
that goes into your typical SSDs is
something that's been released for quite
a while now but is finally starting to
be mass adopted in laptops where in my
opinion it makes the biggest difference
the technology works and it works
extremely well we've seen this in the
previous videos that the performance
benefits are there but also the
convenience is certainly there to where
you can add obtain to existing drives
that were otherwise slow and essentially
breathe new life into an existing
computer however Intel is now partnering
with all major notebook vendors
australia-wide and is now rolling out
pre-installed octane in these notebooks
as an option and it is one that you
should seriously consider if you want
faster speeds but it's also something
you may want to consider too if you are
a value orientated person
so here we are with four different
laptops all of these rolled out in major
retails australia-wide Adele Inspiron 15
1500 a HP Envy x-360 a Lenovo IdeaPad
330 s and an Acer SP 314 14 inch
convertible
what makes obtain then so special in
these laptops well it doesn't add much
cost to your computer at all and it
seamlessly links up with an existing
slow hard drive no matter how old what
shape and what size it is to essentially
make a hybrid drive that will be much
faster than your typical hard drive
though the technology involved with
octane is actually quite interesting
Intel with their obtained modules don't
use typical NAND flash that's found on
most SSDs instead in these modules they
are using what they call 3d crosspoint
memory it is still non-volatile memory
but it can deliver latency closer to
that of volatile memory that is DRAM
sticks that go in your typical desktop
computers the latency has been
drastically reduced compared to that of
NAND flash and modules themselves are
not anywhere near as expensive as DRAM
for example and we've previously done
two videos here on the channel one where
we look at the performance on a laptop
with obtain enabled versus disabled and
we've also taken a look on a desktop
variant where we have compared the ad in
octane module to SSDs and also hard
drives at a 7200 rpm 3.5 inch and the
results were very close to that of SSDs
so the speeds are very close but today
we have four laptops here on the desk
and we're going to run some more tests
with octane enabled vs. disabled to see
how much of a difference this piece of
tech makes in all these mainstream
laptops that are being rolled out astray
of wide but also on top of that I want
to get a bigger sample size than the
previous video we did so the first
little laptops here with octane enabled
vs. disabled was the Acer sp3 one for
when we're booting up the machine we got
15 seconds with octane enabled versus 2
minutes and 31 seconds with the disabled
opening up a large 4k video file source
get 2 seconds versus 12 seconds with
octane disabled then moving on to a game
called scum which is a new release title
on PC that's actually still in beta this
scored one minute and 12 seconds to boot
up versus 2 minutes and three seconds
with obtained disabled so all across the
board there were some big gains with the
ACE sp3 one for moving onto the dell
inspiron were retested Butantan
passed and they made quite a difference
with octane and empresses disabled for
case or for seconds versus 55 seconds
which was unusual for the obtain
disabled to get such a slow number but
this was indeed correct
moving on to scum we saw one minute and
22 seconds versus 3 minutes and 6
seconds so there was a huge difference
in the load times on this particular
laptop move over to the Lenovo IdeaPad
330 s we saw boot times again a
significant advantage with octane
enabled versus disabled 13 seconds
versus 1 minute and 37 seconds opening a
large 4k video file or two seconds
versus 12 seconds yet again and then
moving over to scum loading this up took
1 minute and 33 seconds versus 3 minutes
flat with obtain disabled then last stop
was the HP MV X 3 70 boot times were 29
seconds with octane enabled versus 4
minutes with it off I actually had a lot
of troubles with octane disabled with
this particular laptop a 4k video file
we had 3 seconds versus 19 seconds and
then booting up scum we saw a minute and
12 seconds versus 2 minutes and 45
seconds so across all four different
laptops over 3 different tests octane
made a difference and it was quite a
considerable difference in every single
test we ran so there it all is with
Intel obtain some great benefits to be
had especially in Australia where the
cost of octane is as little as 28 Aussie
dollars for a 16 gigabyte stick and 74
dollars for a 32 gigabyte stick at these
prices it is definitely gonna make it
cost effective in laptops where you can
combine it with either one terabyte or
two terabyte 2.5 inch mechanical drive
and now have a large amount of storage
on your computer but also would have not
have had to forked out for a one
terabyte or two terabyte SSD which can
add greatly to the cost of a laptop or
even a desktop computer anyway these
notebooks on the desk here all have
octane pre-installed and if you're in
the market for one of these laptops then
just look for the sticker that says
Intel obtained or look in the listing
itself and see if it mentions obtained
because it will have it pre-installed
you won't have to go through any hassles
to install it yourself but also on top
of that you will then take advantage of
the great value that octane brings to
the table but if your laptop doesn't
have it installed and it just has a
mechanical hard drive then you can still
add
obtained into the laptop itself and
enable it and take advantage of the
speed differences however do keep in
mind that this technology will be
limited however to Intel seventh gen
processors and upwards meaning you will
at least have to have an Intel 200
series motherboard and an Intel i3 7000
series processor or greater to take
advantage of this caching system though
it definitely gets the nod of approval
here and if you guys enjoyed this video
then be sure to hit that like button and
let us know in the comments section
below
have you tried obtained yet love reading
your thoughts and opinions as always and
I'll catch you in the next Tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
