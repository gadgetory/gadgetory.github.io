brain is coming back to you guys today
with a quick video on has well the i-5
for 670 K versus the Ivy Bridge three
570 K now before I sold my three 570 K I
did a series of benchmarks and now that
I've upgraded to house well and salt my
I 5 3 5 7 k I've done this same series
of benchmarks and I've done these tests
I did them before I sold my overbridge I
did these tests you know time and time
again to make sure the results are fine
and I did them again this time so way
let's move on to the results but first
thing I will say is that I am at 4.8
gigahertz at the moment so the Haswell
chips are looking very impressive at the
moment as overclockers so my i5 i'm
taking i'm recording this on 4.0 gig
overclocked right now so I mean I'm
gonna need more time to play around with
it but yeah 4.8 is good to go so I
imagine some people will be able to get
these things to 5 gigs anyway let's get
on with the results the first benchmark
we have here is Scott rim and now Skyrim
this is the only game I tested I'm gonna
test a lot more games in the next coming
months but this game when I tested when
I did benchmarks in the past this game
always showed the most difference when
you tampered with CPU and RAM settings
so now with house well it showed a
fourteen point two percent increase and
this was just huge I don't know why it
was this big I have to I believe it's
got something to do with the motherboard
and the drivers as well so I'm gonna
look into it a bit more but this you
know it was just an honest benchmark a
real-world benchmark that I did previous
install so use the same save game file
and compared it to this exact same
settings everything was identical GPU
clocks Ram clocks and 4.2 gigahertz
clocks so yeah that was interesting
let's move on to the next benchmark and
we have here a 3d mark 11 CPU score so
it's this the physics cool we're just
looking at the physics cool here and as
we can see here the has well scored a
5.2 percent increase so that was pretty
that's pretty solid that's pretty good
it's not impressive but it's decent so
not too bad there let's move on to super
pi32 Meg so this showed a 4.5
of 6% increase or reduction in time so
that was pretty good as well so it's
it's in synthetic benchmarks it's
looking like it's showing a good 5
percent increase so that seems to be the
go internal clock performance increase
so that's pretty decent not too bad so
let's move on to the last benchmark and
now this was probably the most
interesting so I did the exact same
video exact same settings timed it with
a stopwatch and the ivy bridge clocked
in faster so it rendered the video in 4
minutes and 28 seconds at 4.2 years and
the Haswell rendered it at 4 minutes and
33 seconds so it was 1.7 percent slower
so that's an interesting benchmark there
so this is cs5 as well Premiere Pro so
pretty interesting results here anyway
so let's get onto the conclusion and
whether you can whether you should
upgrade to Haswell or not okay so we saw
the results there and they were pretty
damn weird the Skyrim was very
impressive and I did that at the exact
same save game file exact same settings
across the GPU RAM and CPU so it was
very impressive that Skyrim was showing
an extra like 14% so take in mind that
Skyrim is the most CPU and RAM dependent
game that I've tested and that's why I
basically wanted to test Skyrim to show
you guys what you could maximum up to
expect in performance increases so that
was a very interesting result the
rendering test was very interesting too
it was in favor of Ivy Bridge so that
was interesting as well so the
synthetics showed about a 5 percent
increase as well and the main thing is I
guess the overclocked ability is over
clocks about you know 10 percent better
then Ivy I'm guessing so that's a very
good feature so it's a very good thing
about house well all in all i'm gonna
say that if you're already on Ivy Bridge
there's really no need to upgrade I just
upgraded because I you know loved tech
it's awesome and if you're on sandy and
or before that you may wish to upgrade
because the z87 motherboard is packed
with features
so many features on you know all side of
three ports the awesome onboard with
their solutions the awesome ni c that
integrated all on the board it's very
sexy very good especially some of the
you know the msi is a really
good-looking board i love it so awesome
awesome stuff from msi this this
generation of motherboards anyway so i'm
getting really tired so hey guys if you
enjoyed this video please give it a
thumbs up if you have any questions or
comments please leave a comment in the

have you guys around here anyway peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
