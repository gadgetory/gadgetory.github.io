review I started testing it and doing
some benchmarks and I noticed
performance figures that we're really
low and as they shouldn't be and then I
changed some settings in the NVIDIA
GeForce experience panel and I fixed it
so let's talk about how you can fix this
really easily
and talk about what else you can do to
get better performance welcome to taxi
this is brand coming to you guys today
with a quick fix video on how to get
better performance with the recent
GeForce experience now straight away you
want to go on the menu and turn off this
share feature all you have to do is go
in there click that off and you should
be good to go your graphics card will
now perform as it should one other thing
you also want to do if you haven't
already is turn off game DVR in Windows
10 itself now another thing that
surprised me is if you turn this feature
off you'll now no longer be able to use
shadowplay which I know a lot of you
guys will want to use shadowplay
especially for capturing gameplay so if
you want to do that you can turn the
share feature on but just make sure the
instant replay is still turned off
however the unfortunate thing about
having this share feature on even with
instant replay off is that you'll still
have a performance drop I found around
about 5% so if you have the share
feature on and the instant replay on
you'll get around 10 to 15% drop in
performance which was really bad not to
mention I was getting a lot of
stuttering as well whilst playing games
now why this has happened I don't know
and why we are the public a beta testers
I don't know as well I'm just wishing
video would test these things before
they released it into the wild and we're
getting problems like this I mean I
found people in the comments were
complaining about performance especially
one person complaining about 980ti
performance this is probably a good fix
for that and I recommend anyone who's
having performance problems with a
recent update on their video cards turn
this share feature off anyway guys I
hope you enjoyed this quick video let me
know in the comments section below have
you been having any problems with the
latest Nvidia drivers if so what love to
hear your comments as usual if you
haven't already hit that like button and
I'll catch you in another tag video very
soon he's out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
