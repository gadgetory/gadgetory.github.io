takea city the Sun has gone down
I've been benchmarking up in building
pcs diagnosing problems then after dawn
after dawn it just repeats then as we go
into the night I do the same thing it's
benchmarking building and then we do the
exact same thing and right here we got
Darth Jar Jar with the jewels Aeons that
is the X 56 90s on the EVGA sr2
motherboard today we're gonna be turning
this thing on going into the bias
overclocking it and then running some
games and also some synthetic benchmarks
to see finally how this thing performs
welcome back to tech yes city guys right
here we have the custom build called
Darth Jar Jar and we've fired it up if
you guys want to know everything inside
this build I'll put the link up here for
these showcase of this PC but today
we're gonna go into the BIOS and we're
gonna be overclocking these two CPUs and
seeing how they perform and then also
seeing what we can do with this graphics
card if this loop doesn't present too
much of a problem with those overclocked
CPUs first so we're gonna go into the
bus right now and see what's up
so here we are first time in the EVGA
sr2 bios and this is I'm guessing it's
gonna be a little bit different because
it is an American trip megatrends BIOS
but you can see over here they got a
frequency and voltage control menu which
usually on say for instance gigabyte I
think they've got a menu over here with
frequency MIT and all that stuff but
going into here frequency voltage we can
now move down and have a look what's
this what this is all about cuz I'm kind
of like well what's going on here this
signal tweaks like this is like looking
like it's a whole new menu I've never
seen anything like this in a BIOS menu
before actually so we can actually
change and looks like we can delay the
signal times maybe that's for extreme
overclocking again this is pretty crazy
so maybe I can mess with this a little
bit later if we try to go a little bit
higher with the overclocks but going
into this voltage control here this is
like looking pretty different too so I'm
kind of going on blast to the past here
and I'm gonna figure things out on the
fly so bear with me now but we got here
without droop I'm guessing that's load
line calibration because we don't want
to be droop and we're gonna go boot up
via court and eventual Wow so they've
got actual different voltages for the
boot up via core as opposed to the
actual what it will eventuate now I'm
guessing hardcore overclockers would
like this in competitions because I
believe the EVGA sr2 motherboard was
made strictly for competition and so
what they've done here is they've got
now these two settings because when you
boot up your computer sometimes you can
get what's called voltage spikes that
are higher than what it would eventually
once your computer is running nowadays
the power supplies especially if you're
buying a really good power supply and
coupling with a motherboard like this
you shouldn't have to worry too much and
we are using the HX 1200 so we shouldn't
have any problems setting this to say
1.4 so oh wow okay we can't actually
type the numbers in we probably need a
numpad I'm actually using a 10 keyless
keyboard here so we're gonna have to
quickly bump in all these voltages that
are
be comfortable with to say a 4.4
gigahertz overclock initially and we'll
see if we can get that to boot
so now we're back to the main menu here
and it's just like any x58 motherboard
it looks like they don't have the
individual control so you have to set
the CPUs at the exact same frequency
which makes sense otherwise you'd just
have a computer crash instantly after
running at different frequencies I
believe especially in this era of
computing so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna change these two this should
be our B base clock and so we should be
able to go and aim until we get around
4.4 gigahertz so that's 4.4 right there
so that's what it's looking like we will
turn off our turbo as well if there's a
setting for that because turbo can get
in the way okay so now we're changing
our Qi frequency as well as our ddr3
memory speeds but this is where things
get a little bit weird because I'm not
entirely sure why these uncle speeds
aren't changing with the actual base
clock speeds themselves so this is
something different about the EVGA SR 2
is the memory frenzies are locked in at
33 1333 megahertz and same with this
uncle here they're sort of like been
separated from this CPU strap here so
we're just gonna give this a try anyway
so it's it locked in the basic settings
now if you guys are wondering how I know
about x58 and why it's like my first
going I'm just sort of troubleshooting
and guessing here it's cuz that's how I
do overclocking I just trial and error
and learn everything myself because when
I went to start overclocking there was
just so many different guides and people
saying different things that worked and
didn't work for them and I just thought
to myself well why not figure this out
and then from there I've made my own
overclocking to drivers myself so I'm
kind of adding to the fray if you guys
want to check that out for x58 I'll put
a link up here for that of all school
age 55 as I love these errors all
motherboards and computing I'm gonna say
that to profile one
and then we're gonna restart and see if
we can get a boot ski so we've got our
temperatures here before we even start
the stress test and our idols are
looking like they're quite high 40
degrees I mean it is about 25 degrees in
here at the moment but we can hear that
start button and see if it can sort of
handle an initial stress here on those
CPUs and maybe let that run for 10
minutes if it can surpass this test here
then I'll be pretty confident in 4.4
gigahertz providing it can survive this
for around 10 minutes so we just passed
the 10-minute mark with these Zeon's
and the max temperatures we've got here
80 degrees on core 1 and core 608 core 1
has also got 81 degrees so this is a 4.4
gigahertz and one point 4 volts so
admittedly it does seem like it's a
little bit too much for the 4.4
gigahertz off the top of my memory but
still I wanted to make sure that both
these CPUs work because we now got two
CPUs so we kind of got a deal with
double the silicon lottery but they are
the X 56 90s so I'm not too concerned
but one thing we also notice is that the
ddr3 memory here is being indeed
overclocked by the B clock and I'm
guessing the Ankur will go with that too
so I do have to be a little bit careful
if I want to step it off further
especially since these temperatures here
and I think that already moved up to 82
now I do have to be careful with these
temperatures because that's sort of like
my max threshold that I'm happy with at
the moment given that we're still gonna
add the GPU in the loop in some of these
tests so what I'm gonna try and do is go
maybe for 4.5 at this same voltage and
see if it holds but I will quickly run a
Cinebench score just to make sure that
it's Cinebench stable at these sort of
settings and then we'll go back into the
bias quickly change to 4.5 see if we can
get those speeds so we actually got a
blue screen on the 4.4 gigahertz it was
going so good Oh we'll try and just
tweak some settings in the BIOS and see
if we get 4.4 stable
so we've got the Cinebench run finished
and we got 1917 CB so I'd love to try
and get it's the mm just sort of that'd
be just cool so we what we did this time
we did drop the memory speeds in the
Encore down and up the CPU PLL ever so
slightly so we'll try going for four
point five now anyway
so basically this is just this PC is not
having a bar of this it's saying not 4.5
you guys you're just not gonna get it
tonight okay so it looks like we're sort
of topping out now after a heap of
different testing so the four point four
two gigahertz and the memories going to
1700 megahertz and I've tried getting
into 4.5 gigahertz it just crashes
pretty much instantly and same with the
memory as well having the memory up to a
little bit above 1700 megahertz
unfortunately crashes Mbeki are six
sticks of memory and as we said before
to two CPUs our chances of crashing is
gonna be a lot higher than more
components we add into the mix so that's
pretty much gonna do it for me now I've
got that sort of 90% or 95% level of
overclock and then I'm gonna start
installing games and in the morning
we'll come back and I'll overclock the
grabs card and then we'll start getting
you guys some figures but basically with
this motherboard as well it is pretty
hard to overclock because it takes so
long to boot up so every time you crash
you're gonna wait about four or five
minutes for you go back into the BIOS to
all your overclock then get back into
Windows and then see if it crashes again
but the fact that we've got four point
four two gigahertz on two of these CPUs
and our memory at seventeen hundred
megahertz it's still really good
the Cinebench schools are still really
good too I was just hoping for a little
bit more but of course I could probably
get there but it would take me days and
days and just for that extra hundred or
two hundred megahertz so let's get some
rest and we'll come back and see you
guys tomorrow morning and here we are at
the next day and Windows is still gonna
do a feature update to 1803 and we're
still downloading a bit of battlefield 5
as well on this PC but all the other
games are installed and while this
happens we've wires will start trying to
overclock the graphics card or should I
say gravis card
so it does look like now we've found our
sweet spot overclock for this 980ti and
we see here we've got about 800
megahertz on the memory 110 on the core
clock now of course I do want to stress
test this a little bit more in
benchmarks and let it roll out but I
will need to update to the latest driver
and currently Windows Update is blocking
that from happening so I'm gonna restart
the system now get the latest drivers
then run the benchmarks and see if this
overclock will hold in long term the
temperatures however are looking really
good already on this GPU block nothing's
really going it's like 42 degrees max so
far so this is really actually good news
for this 980ti
so we just finished up testing
synthetics and time spy extreme we got a
cpu score of 3168 and also a gravis core
of 3137 so not too bad
moving over to fire strike we've got a
score of nineteen thousand three hundred
sixty three on the GPU and twenty
thousand eight hundred and forty nine on
the CPU and then four you know gene
heaven on 1080p high settings we got
four thousand eight hundred fifty four
the points with one hundred ninety two
point five half PS now the reason why
this GPU score might be a little bit
underpowered compared to say running it
with a ninety nine hundred K is because
typically dual CPUs in simulated
benchmarks like fire strike and time spy
will perform a little bit worse than if
you had them coupled with a ninety nine
hundred K so that's kind of expected but
still I'm pretty impressed with these
schools it's doing well let's see now
how well it performs in games
so we just finished with shadow of the
Tomb Raider and we're getting 49 average
FPS at 1440p high settings this is
actually a really good result
considering the minimums are very smooth
as well so I'm actually pretty impressed
with the Jules Eon so far considering
they can come into problems with some
games but I do think since the Rison
introduction of those chips dual CPU
gaming has got a lot of better because
Windows itself has had a few updates but
we'll find out now with the next title
Resident Evil 2
so we just finished up at resident evil
- 1440p ultra-white and the good news is
that the GPU is getting a hundred
percent utilized we can even see this
while we're all tapped out with
benchmark notes up here so we did three
runs and it's kind of all over the place
in terms of how long I'm running it for
because for some reason on this computer
and this set up the show own statistics
is just cutting off when I hit that so
we're still able to get accurate results
here we're getting around 72 average FPS
and the 1% in point 1% lows are pretty
good but in this game in particular I
think it's utilizing like 7 threads so
it clearly is a console optimized first
game but it's great to see that the
jewsí ons are still having no hiccups
and problems running this title also
dx12 in this title pretty much gave us
the exact same results except this time
around the threads that were being
utilized switch from the first CPU to
the second CPU but now let's check out a
more single thread intensive game like
dota 2
so here's the results for dota 2 and
this actually did really well I'm
surprised they've optimized dota 2 a lot
more than they used to it was running so
smooth on the jewels eons it was
actually using more threads than I
thought it would this was on DX 11 I
believe dx11 runs the best out of the
api's now the top part here is the max
settings and the graphics card was like
hovering between high 80s and low 90s
really good news and then below here was
the low settings and we got 1440p ultra
white on both we got here near 180
average FPS the 17.1% lows are a
mediocre they're still very good
considering it's smooth gameplay but
other than that I'm really impressed so
far let's try however the pinnacle of
dual CPUs for a video game and that is
Doom on Vulcan
so here's the results with doom on
Vulcan and this ran extremely well the
average FPS is like a hundred and twenty
five one percent point one percent lows
are incredible now the thing about this
on Vulcan is that all the threads and
cores are being utilized really well
really evenly and that makes the GPU
pretty much top out near 100% and has
actually stressed the GPU that much that
I found that it's actually not a hundred
percent stable it was artifacting
slightly and it's overclocks but we'll
see the other two games can replicate
the artifacts the doom is just such a
well designed game so battlefield 5 I
had it at 1440p ultra wide and I knew
straight away high settings gonna be a
bit too low so I changed it down to low
settings and the CPU usage was still a
single threat heavy on one of the
threads but it did spread it all across
12 threads by the looks of it after that
all the other threads were just not
being utilized in this title but
regardless the FPS was still pretty good
low settings 1440p ultra was getting
like 73 FPS 50 average FPS for high
settings it's on a 980 TI so if we had a
better graphics card I'm sure we could
get higher FPS but the Jules Eon sort of
weren't the best showing in battlefield
5 if I may say but with that said let's
try the grand finale and that is apex
Legends
and now the last of the benchmarks is
finished with Apex legends and this got
around 74 FPS the first go the next go
got 65 the next go got 72 roughly and
the 0.1% 1% lows are really good on the
Jules Eon setup even though the game
itself uses about 12 threads
it is very GPU dependent even at 1440p
ultra wide low settings we were getting
some numbers that which is maxing out
the GPU and this is what we've got here
so if you want to play apex legends with
high FPS you'll need a really good
graphics card and we've already got a
980ti overclock so there's that so there
we have it with the dual x58 Zeon's this
thing was absolutely incredible to the
point where it did a lot better than I
expected I thought some games would have
come into some problems but miraculously
everything played really smoothly so I
guess it's a testament to how far the
two CPU setup has come in the last few
years because years ago when I used the
Juno cron set up that was just having so
many problems especially for gaming to
the point where it frustrated me a lot
this is a older motherboard and also CPU
architecture than that and it's doing a
lot better now all the titles we played
here today got really good FPS the GPU
is getting max and pretty much 90% over
on pretty much all those six titles that
we played the synthetic benchmarks were
doing very well - not that far behind
utilizing the 980ti as opposed to using
with a 9900 K for example but ultimately
I'm that impressed to the point where I
may now take a look at that one and -
CPU setup with the Sandy Bridge as Aeons
because they do go very cheap because I
was just that impressed with this setup
I mean it's a lot of fun overclocking it
I can extract a little bit more
performance but I will do that once I
get more time on my hands but so far
here today we've got some really good
results surprisingly the power
consumption was of course a bit high I
did test this out in Doom and we got
some high figures there but besides that
I mean there are some things I
can improve on with this build I
definitely like to drop the noise so
maybe I might get some magnetic
levitating fans from Corsair the ML
series and also fix up that pump try and
reduce the noise and then I could
legitimately use this as a dedicated
streaming PC but maybe also as a gaming
PC itself like it really impressed me
that much anyway guys let us know in the
comment section below what you think of
the Jules Eon setup I mean I was just
blown away by it is there any more test
that you want to see if so let us know
as well and with that said I hope you
