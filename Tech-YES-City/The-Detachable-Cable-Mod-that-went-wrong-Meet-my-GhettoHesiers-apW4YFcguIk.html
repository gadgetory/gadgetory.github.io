today I'm coming back to you guys too
with a video that was supposed to be a
dick a detachable detachable cable mod
for any pair of headphones so how to
turn a normal headphone like this into a
something like this where you have a
gaming headset when you can make it
detachable and use it with a V motor
boom pro like this now as you guys know
I recently reviewed the v-moda burn pro
and I was impressed by at it basically
you know if you have a detachable point
here you can just turn any headphones
and the audio file headphones into a
gaming headset so it was really
impressive not to mention that the
speaker cable itself is also good as
well just know it's not going to you
know deteriorate any of your audio
quality but let's look now i'll be
getting this guide done like it's a
thorough guide i'll be getting it done
in the future i'm going to be modding
these and doing a thorough guide for you
guys and you know I want you know
because people like well there's the
Angela on mod mech and yeah the ant
alarm on because ok but you've got two
cables so I'd rather you guys if you
could change this into a detachable
cable and then you can put in a very
motor boom pro or any other maybe a
cheap Chinese alternative when it comes
out anyway this is what I found when I
had these I found a pretty what would
you call it startling revelation i had
these these HD 595 so i was originally
i'm going to do the guy for you guys i
almost had it done and then basically
when i got it done the left and the
right speakers were confused and so you
know i basically you know some guy had
an image up there and it was wrong on
the internet so i basically looked on
ahead fire for him and people identified
the speaker wires and then when i got it
right this the headphones just so i must
have you know the solarin must have
damaged there were some of the wise
internally and things just didn't work
properly like the right was leaking into
the left and it just sounded all crazy
but when i pulled the headphones apart
this was what i noticed you hear me hot
see this see me holding this wire here
this was like the scary thing san hires
up use the same they use the positive
and negative Y and they put it in the
same wire I mean yeah it looks like
their shielding the positive with some
red kind of paint or something like that
but where I come from you know I'm on
may call me old school but I like
to have my positive and negative wire in
separate wire in separate wiring and you
know when i change this when I saw this
I was horrified I was like damn I ripped
it all out ripped all the speaker cable
out from sennheiser decided to solder
the speakers you know sort of this new
wire which is like 40 cents sold it to
the speaker's themselves and then run it
to a jack and so it looks pretty bad but
when I did this it sounded freaking
phenomenal these headphones just sounded
way more fuller they just sounded rich
they sounded good the base was better
the meds were just more rich the highs
were there that was rich this whole
headphone just sounds amazing now once
after i did this mod so maybe you guys
in the headphone community you might
want to look into this I don't know but
these headphones now sound freaking
amazing they're now in the same league
as my fidelio x1's so that says a lot
for this mod anyway that's just
enlightening you know why does
sennheiser put the same wire and then
you know put the positive negative in
the same wire I have no idea maybe they
just want to cost my guess is that they
cost cutting but you know it's a cost
cut and it's detrimental to your audio
performance in my opinion honestly
lastly I want to say is you know I
seriously I would look into getting if
you guys wanted a really good set of
headphones and you don't mind getting
your head hands dirty you may wish to go
and get a pair of HD 5 18 and then you
can you know maybe if you want to rip
all the speaker wire out change it over
for some good stuff and then maybe
modify the backplate you'll probably
have a set of headphones that sounds
better than a two-hundred-dollar set of
HD 598 because if you guys didn't know
the HD 518 use the same speakers as the
HD 598 so you have a seventy dollar
headphone if you can mod it properly
sounding better than a
two-hundred-dollar headphone from the
same manufacturer anyway that's
something to look into it was something
that kind of startled me and these
things sound freaking phenomenal now you
know coupled with this this is my new
gaming headset of choice and you're
probably asking why would you prefer
these over the fidelio x1's these just
have that sound signature they've got
he's got that bump in the midst and
shall I pull up frequency response curve
for you this is basically if you're a
gamer you want that bump in the meds
because that's where all the voices and
footsteps and all the gunfire is
happening so if you have that boost in
the mids that's better for you as a
gamer also the soundstage on these
headphones it's really good after i did
this mod it's pretty much in the same
league as the x1's they both have really
good sound stage so honestly you know I
can recommend doing this mod it's
something to look into for you guys in
the headphone community I was pretty
startled but like what the hell's going
on but yeah you know now these things
sound amazing they look terrible they
sound amazing now so anyway I can
recommend this mod I'll be coming with
the detachable cable mod soon when i get
some time it will take me a while
because i want to do a nice guide for
you guys and pretty much going to make
any headphone I'd to catch a detachable
cable which will allow you plug in one
of these babies anyway I hope you
enjoyed this little video / semi rant
wasn't really a rant I didn't really get
angry because these sound amazing now
and i only got them for one hundred
dollars if i'll be coming back with
another tech video soon most likely
reviewing the sound blaster z which is a
mixed bag but anyway we'll get on to
that soon anyway peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
