some are labeling it as The Empire
Strikes Back anyways I'd have to agree
except for the fact this time the Empire
doesn't have many imperial star
destroyers in their fleet so that's kind
of referring to the stock levels of the
8700 K but with that aside I did manage
to get a sample set in from asrock there
Z 370 gaming i7 and also an 8700 K which
I'll be doing some benchmarks for you
guys in an upcoming video I've actually
completed all the results hence why I'm
building this machine and why I can
recommend it and we've also got besides
that the galaxy X 1080 Ti this thing is
super fast it's also got the wide
aesthetic so will look really good and
it will also perform really well below
that we've got the Corsair RM 850 X this
is Johnny gurus personal favorite out of
the Corsair power supply lineup great
value but also really good componentry
in this pounce play and then we've got
the 570 X this is a tempered glass case
with three RGB fans at the front that
not only add to the aesthetic but also
do a really good job of cooling in this
case is very easy to work with course
they were also kind enough to send out a
120 gigabyte SSD and also a 16 gigabyte
dual channel kit of RGB memory and then
for cooling we've got the h1 10 I this
is a really good all-in-one solution to
140 millimeter fans does a really good
job for all-in-ones it's actually one of
the best out there for getting those low
temperatures especially on a deal it'ld
8700 k and if you guys follow me on
twitter I did a live deal lidding of the
8700 k at Bunnings Warehouse cost me
nothing because I used one of their
biases and it worked perfectly fine
welcome back to tech yes City today
we've got one massive build if you guys
are into new parts and you want to get
the latest and greatest and of course
you have a bit of money in your stack
this build will definitely give you
results 2167 US dollars if you were to
go buy all the parts yourself build this
thing and if you're in Australia will
cost around 3,000 a strand also it is
very expensive not the best price
performance but one of the best in terms
of absolute performance I've done the
results on this combination before I've
done this build and the performance is
simply amazing with the GT X 1080 Ti
with an i7 8700 K overclock to 5
gigahertz now on that note of the 8700 K
if you're overclocking these then you
will probably want to delive them as
they're before temperatures I had the
over clocks just simply failing at 5
minutes
after I deal it it I got an instant 15
degree drop this was a minute into the
benchmark and of course the 5 gigahertz
overclock was now stable at the same
voltages there we'll all that aside
let's build this PC overclock and then
tune it and then after that we're gonna
see just how well it runs in today's
titles
so now we've completed this bill with
all its glorious RGB however there were
some hiccups along the way the first
being the cable management at the back
of the 570 X since there is RGB
controller than a lot of extra wires I
don't see myself using a ketchup and
mustard build for example with cable
extensions I just think you'd run into a
lot of suffocation in terms of cable
space and not only that the H 110 I off
the top here actually doesn't fit flush
I had to change the to 140 mm fans
around swap them with 120mm fans and
then zip tie those down just so we could
get an even fit now of course you can
take out this 280 millimeter radiator
mounted to the front of the case and
when you do that you have to take out
three pre-installed fans which actually
give this case really good airflow so I
don't really want to do that as I'll
actually be a detriment to temperatures
for like the GP year for example and the
vrm on the motherboard though of course
with all that aside it's now time to
overclock this thing and then tune it
and we're going to focus on some
competitive multiplayer titles at both
1080p and 4k since of course we have the
1080 TI to match this demand
now we just finished overclocking the
8700 K to five gigahertz and we've got
84 degrees on one core now this is kind
of like the max threshold that I'm happy
with for everyday usage I wouldn't want
to go any higher this is in a 25 degree
C ambient environment now if we were
using the 140 mm fans we would get
better temperatures also in the upcoming
benchmark video you will see better
temperatures because I will be using
100% fan profiles and so this is so I
can get an apples-to-apples comparison
however in this video I will be using
PWM controlled fan profiles because
they're much better for everyday usage
of course when I'm editing a video I
wouldn't want a hundred percent fan
noise creeping in it would drive me
crazy so with the PWM fan profiles 5
gigahertz deleted CPU and the
temperatures are pretty good I'll let
you guys take a quick listen on max load
and for the GTX 10 atti from Galax this
thing is really aggressively overclocked
out of the box I couldn't really
overclock it anymore I did manage to get
at 40 megahertz on the core just to get
it over that 2 gigahertz barrier I think
anyone with a GTX 10 series card kind of
wants to get over that 2 Giga as barrier
just to make themselves feel like
they've achieved something myself
included and as for the memory we only
got an extra hundred megahertz effective
so this thing already out of the factory
is really aggressively clocked it's
great for those guys who just want to
put it in their computer start loading
up games you'll get really good
performance out of this card
so what we saw in the benchmarks was as
expected this thing was just destroying
games pub G 1080p high settings we're
getting a hundred and forty-four fps and
I didn't actually know that this game
was hard locked at 144 FPS so that was
interesting to find out and then at 4k
we were still getting over 60 FPS so
both times it was a really enjoyable
experience
overwatch we moved into that 300 FPS at
1080p we stepped it up to 4k we're still
getting over a hundred and twenty FPS so
something like this is already showing
its colors that it's geared up towards
competitive gamers who still like to
play with decent quality settings but
like to get really high frame rates
extending over to csgo I like to use low
and high blend of graphics settings
1080p 600 FPS of pretty much all times
on dust2 then we stepped it up to 4k
we're still getting over 300 FPS most of
the time what about dota 2 and this is a
game that I probably play the most in my
spare time I like to play this
competitively 1080p 240 FPS we step it
up to 4k we're still getting well over a
hundred and fifty FPS at high settings
and it was at these settings that the
game engine was kind of breaking up it
was a weird experience where there was
some really odd stuttering going on
however when we dropped it up or raised
it up to 4k settings we saw that we're
getting still over a hundred FPS and it
was extremely smooth at 4k so it was
really good to see this happening in
Grand Theft Auto though what it comes
down to with this build when we look at
the price performance of course Verizon
v 1600 overclocked with the stock cooler
on a be 350 motherboard is still gonna
represent some of the best value for
money in the new part sector but
something with this the 8700 K custom
water cooler GTX 10 80 TI it's
definitely going to be the best when it
comes to gaming whether it be your
competitive gaming you just want the at
most best FPS possible or if you want to
be competitive but still enjoy graphical
settings like myself then something like
this combination is definitely going to
give you that edge that you're looking
for though another odd thing that I've
noticed when I've been trying to gain
competitively is when I'm on the ring
bus architecture enough
from Jules eons or the skylake mesh
architecture or the rising k17
architecture and I've switched over to
the ring bus I noticed that it's more
snappier and responsive and I do have to
back this up with empirical evidence I
know but for some odd reason whenever
I'm on this architecture versus any
others my rating starts to crawl up
again I find myself making better plays
so it's something that I do have to test
with empirical evidence but my feelings
at the moment is that if you are a
competitive gamer and you are looking
for the edge then I believe something
like the ring bus architecture which is
first implemented in the Sandy Bridge
days and even that architecture shares a
lot of similarities with the skylake
architecture and now cold coffee lake
which pretty much the same thing just
two extra cores formal threads is the
best if you're a competitive gamer so
again I do have to back this off with
some empirical evidence when I move into
the new studio room which is common guys
it's actually being made right now I'm
gonna be uploading a vlog very soon I
will be running some tests for you guys
to see if I can find any differences or
if it's all just in my head and a
placebo effect of course something like
this if you're into buying new gear this
is like the premium best of the best
out there at the moment in my opinion
and really when I think about it when we
compare the cost of something like this
which is 2000 u.s. to something like
cars this is the reason why I got into
PC gaming it was a lot cheaper than cars
I remember being a teenager and in my
young 20s and constantly being broke
buying things like air pods and exhausts
for my cars and really I just all they
got was this loud car that just went Bam
Bam Bam and it broke down and then I'd
be out of more money and then when I got
into PC gaming I started spending money
on my gear and I started getting results
things didn't break down because the
more you spend on computer parts
generally the better gear you're going
to get so something like this it is that
premium option if you compare it to a
sports car like a premium sports car
it's kind of a similar analogy in that
you've got the power there and I'm sure
you're not gonna use it all the time but
it's definitely there just like that
premium sports car option the difference
between computers and sports cars
obviously being sports cars cost a lot
more money anyway I hope you enjoyed
today's video if you did then be sure to
hit that like button
and let me know in the comment section
below if you had two thousand US dollars
to this date what would you build and of
course I'll put some other options in
the description below if you're on a
budget and you still want to get a 1080
TN and 8700 K then I'll put some options
of course on that note with the 8700 K I
did ask a rep at a motherboard company
to ask Intel and I got an answer back
and these stocks for the 8700 K won't be
an easy supply until sometime in
December going through January so that's
when you're really looking at going into
a storm being able to buy one of these
CPUs but until then I see the CPU being
in high demand and low supply so that's
going to create a rut first people who
want to buy it so on that note I did
manage to get an 8400 locally from a
retailer so that CPU seems to be easy to
get however the problem with the 8400 is
that the motherboards that you want to
match it with the budget ones like the
beat 360 and h3 ten don't come out for
another couple of months either so
anyway guys hope you enjoyed today's
video and I'll catch you in another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
