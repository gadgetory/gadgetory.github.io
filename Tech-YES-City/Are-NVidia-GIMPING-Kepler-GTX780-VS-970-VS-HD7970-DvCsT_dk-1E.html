for people asking me to test a GTX 780
and test to see if older drivers
actually give performance benefits which
would mean Nvidia are doing a gimp job
with their latest drivers though today
we're going to be testing not only that
we're going to be thrown in another
rumor that I've been hearing and that is
that a 7970 will actually perform
similar to a GTX 780 nowadays
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
tech yes Cindy this is brian coming to
you guys today with a video on the gtx
780 and I'm testing out two different
driver sets here the newest drivers
being three six 4.7 - I believe and then
the older drivers which I downloaded
from an independent site were the three
forty point five two drivers from
actually a couple of years ago so what
I'm aiming at with this video is I'm
seeing to test whether the older drivers
will actually give a performance boost
not only some of those older titles that
I've tested in the past but also some of
the newer titles to this day now moving
on straight into the benchmarks I really
couldn't find any smoking guns here to
say that Nvidia have been nerfing the
performance of the GTX 780 with driver
updates the one thing that will become
quickly apparent from seeing these
benchmarks is that the GTX 970
especially when I first reviewed it like
a year and a half ago has received a lot
of performance gains through driver
updates now one game that I will pay
particular attention to is Dark Souls 3
which is a recently released title and
we see here that the old-school drivers
for the GTX 780 really made no
difference with the new-school drivers
and what this means essentially is that
Nvidia just aren't really focusing on
updating the drivers for the old-school
Kepler architecture anymore which is
quite a shame when you think about it
considering how much people paid for
those graphics cards only just a couple
of years ago to realize that it's no
longer receiving any driver updates for
them to make games perform that off
Maxwell on the other hand that's been
receiving a lot of love over the last
couple of years since its invidious
latest and greatest architecture lastly
I will touch on the 7970 as well that
was a good 20 percent below the GTX 780
however in Just Cause 3 it was actually
coming pretty close to scoring in the
same league which actually was quite
impressive it does mean that AMD is
giving the 7970 still some pretty good
driver updates so that we have at the
GTX 780 although it hasn't been getting
gimped it also hasn't been getting any
love at all so which kind of disappoints
me considering how much people were
paying for these graphics cards only a
couple of years ago I mean I managed to
get mine for 130 bucks but that's
besides the point though that's
generally how the
industry works I came into this being a
realist knowing that vidi is a publicly
listed company and they needed to make
profit so it's no surprise and you know
at the end of the day if you paid good
money for a GTX 780 unfortunately you're
just another victim of corporatism so
anyway guys that's about it for me today
if you have any questions or comments
about the GTX 780 - be sure to let me
know in the comments section below now
there was that fiasco with witcher 3 and
having severely gived performance on the
kepler architecture and nvidia did fix
that i believe with a driver update
although it took them a little bit of
time so hopefully if we all stay in the
community and we all stay widen and we
communicate to one another then we'll
hopefully stop and video from pulling
shady shenanigans like that again so in
the meantime the GTX 780 still is a
pretty good performing card it's just
not as good as a GTX 970 which is kind
of a shame since it should be in my
opinion anyway that's all from me guys
if you like this video then be sure to
hit that like button if you have any
questions or comments about this video
then be sure to drop a comment the
comment section below and I'll get back
to you as soon as I can
and also the 7970 still is a grade below
the 780 in my opinion and this was
actually a pretty damn aggressively
overclocked card I got this - 1.2
gigahertz anyway I'll catch you in the
next video peace out for now bye now
getting on straight into the benchmarks
we could quite simply see that there was
no smoking gun here except the one in my
pants</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
