the game in technology whether it be
SSDs keyboards mice monitors all the
before of other hardware options out
there for enthusiasts today here on the
desk we have an australian based company
called CHC technologies which sent me
over their 960 gigabyte SSDs and also
480 d bi SSD variants which feature
Samsung based NAND flash now the
controls and everything themselves
they've put these together and they're
giving a 5 year warranty on the product
itself the pricing seems pretty
competitive but there are however a few
problems with the product that I will
address before we get on to the majority
of the review and that is first the
temperature sensor on the 480 gigabyte
SSD was staying at a static 49 degrees
so I couldn't actually get a proper
reading until I used my FLIR one thermal
imaging sensor which showed that the
temperatures of course were getting
hotter when put under stress tests the
temperatures were acceptable and it
looks like it's using the metal tray to
dissipate some of this heat however the
metal tray itself could be a detriment
because the 960 gigabyte version that we
have here actually died after one
transfer so I'm not entirely sure why
that happened perhaps it absorbs shock
too easily as opposed to a plastic SSD
casing I'm not entirely sure what
happened but the SSD just stopped
working and this was the more expensive
option so although there is a five-year
warranty I'm sure a lot of people
wouldn't want to buy a product and have
to go through the hassles of returning
it and getting it sent back and going
back and forth so yes I did receive a
faulty product but the numbers were
pretty impressive out of the 480 web
version we had here especially for the
price tag and what you're getting was
something that came close to a crucial
MX 500 for example and also a Samsung
860 evoke both which are very popular
value orientated options for people who
just want an SSD want to load up their
computer get the benefits of an SSD over
a hard drive and also load up games
quicker and just in general have an
snappier experience
due to those much faster 4k reading
rights that are offered with SSDs but
what we got here of course is something
that doesn't throttle which I've been
checking out on a lot of SSDs and this
is even though they use TLC man based
flash the reason it doesn't throttle as
we saw in the Samsung Evo 970 review
which is a nvme based drive I'll put the
review up here if you want to check that
out is that the maximum speeds even when
they do throttle on the Samsung base TLC
NAND flash is much higher than that of
sada threes max 500 megabytes per second
connection speeds so really when it
comes down to the Samsung NAND flash to
use the 3d NAND flash even though its
TLC and even though it does bring costs
down and it's cheaper than mlc doesn't
throttle because the maximum speeds are
being reached near the threshold so
performance figures read and writes
we're going just over 500 megabytes on
the reads the writes are going near that
as well and the 4k random reading writes
nothing out of the ordinary input
outputs are a little bit behind that of
the crucial M X 500 and also the 860 Evo
which saw this drive itself not able to
get a higher final score the access
times were in a similar ballpark so
ultimately this drive does perform
pretty well and just it's sad to see
that in ways it's still a little bit
underdeveloped but my hat's do go off to
a local Ozzie company trying to have a
crack at making an SSD especially when
the case itself does look really nice I
do like the styling of this SSD product
and it will look very nice in a number
of different cases especially if you
have gunmetal gray as a main theme in
your build
so in conclusion CHC technologies and
their SSDs I still feel like they're a
little bit underdeveloped the
temperature sensor not working properly
on the 480 gigabyte model coupled with
the fact that the 960 gigabyte died
after a file transfer the first file
transfer I was doing isn't that
reassuring to me especially since I've
never had an SSD die however hardware
failure especially when you're dealing
with as many PC parts as I'm dealing
with does happen and I would like to see
perhaps these SSDs stress tested a lot
more than they otherwise would have been
perhaps because this did the 960
gigabyte version which
holding my hand right now did die on the
first transfer so as I said before which
does make me believe that perhaps if it
was stress tested a little bit more it
would have shown the early symptoms of a
problematic drive and CHD technologies
could have fixed it before sending it
out anyway regardless I do like to see a
newcomer coming into the field I do like
more competition and the driver as well
as I said before is aesthetically
pleasing I hope you guys enjoyed this
review if you did then be sure to hit

peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
