- [Host] But in a competition like this,
sometimes those RTX 2080
Ti's get affected by VirusS,
and then that can
combine with a Bǎng Baby,
and cause all sorts of problems.
So in 2018, this is the 10th anniversary
of this overclocking tournament,
there is a total of 20 competitors,
playing for first place prize pool
of six thousand US dollars,
second place is five thousand,
and third place four
thousand, now there's also
a bonus 20 thousand US
dollars up for grabs,
for every world record that is broken,
so if you break a world
record at this event,
there is a one thousand dollar piece
for each of those records,
and in last year's 2017 event,
there was 16 world records
broken in Thailand,
if you haven't seen that event already,
I'll put the link up here for you guys,
Now in terms of this competition itself,
there's four different benchmarks,
ranging from times by
3DMark, to Port Royal,
the new ray tracing benchmark,
and then moving across
to Cinebench R15 on
the CPU side of things,
as well as a Geekbench
multi-core benchmark.
Now in terms of each of the competitors
and what hardware they are using,
they'll all receive a RTX 2080 Ti
special OC Labs edition,
I'm told there's only 100 of
these made, and they feature
a 16 plus three phase
power design, as well as having
three eight pin connectors,
and also a special sample BIOS,
which is not going to
released to the public,
with of course some very
generous overclocking settings
there, enabling them to extract
the most of out the LN2.
Also equally as crazy is
they're using Hall of Fame,
48 hundred megahertz XMP profile memory,
CL 19-26-26-46, and the
outputting custom heatsinks
on this memory too.
As this competition
continues, I will update you
on all the twists and turns
as this is really exciting
when you're here in person,
and I'll try to give you
the best experience possible
on the showroom floor.
(electronic buzzing)
So starting out this competition,
looks like all the
competitors are going with
the CPU bound benchmarks,
that being Cinebench and also
Geekbench multicore.
And they have set a ceiling
for the clock speeds
on the CPU at six gigahertz,
so the competitors
can keep it fair across the
board, and not have someone
lockout with silicon lottery, for example,
where we do know,
especially with the 9900 K,
there's some big variance
when it comes to those CPUs
and locking out.
Also when we move on to the
graphic cards themselves,
the hundred samples here of the
RTX 2080 Ti OC Labs editions
are binned, so it does keep
this competition a lot more
fairer, in that the person with
the most skills on this day
will come out ahead.
Some of the strategies involved, however,
are really interesting already.
Some are just quickly
getting the Cinebench and
multi gig scores done and
dusted, and then moving onto
the GPU scores, and then moving back to
the CPU scores later, but
for instance a competitor
who won 2016's competition
Lucky Noob, he's actually
going for the CPU rankings,
number one on both,
straight away and taking his
time, and then he's gonna
finish off with the RTX 2080
Ti scores, I guess trying to
seal the deal from
2017's winner, Alex Roe,
who's currently on the
leaderboard at second place.
Now besides all this, I was
speaking with Galax in relation
to the RMA rates and all those
rumors you've been hearing
about RTX cards failing,
and they tell me that
nothing's unusual about
the RMA rates on their
RTX 2000 series cards
across all product skews,
they have heard however
some of the founder's cards
were having problems,
so if there is any truth
to those rumors, then it would
be within relation to the
founder's cards themselves,
and not the cards that the
AIB partners, or at least
Galax, have been testing out.
However, speaking of RTX
cards in late 2018 from Galax,
they are keeping up that
commitment with their EXOC models,
having a clean aesthetic but
also bringing really good value
to the table, and then if
you wanna step things up
and you have a higher budget,
they have the Hall of Fame
series cards, bringing
that bigger and juicer VRM
and bigger PCB, as well as
that massive cooler on board.
Though as for Australia
and RTX cards, they tell me
that the 2070 is their
main goal, and they will be
revamping their EXOC model,
which they then will allow me to
review for you guys on the
channel, so stay tuned for that.
But also with their DDR4
memory, they are of course,
as we saw before with these
competitors, releasing some
aggressively timed memory,
as well as bringing
what I thought is some of
the best looking aesthetics
to DDR4 memory, I was confused.
They had the neuro-style finish,
but it looked like it was
continuing on, like kind of translucent.
I had to scratch my head for a second,
but they are releasing
different skews of those
across southeast Asia,
yet to hit Australia
with some of that DDR4 memory.
(happy electronic music)
I also forgot the golden
microphone this time,
I was told to cut down on
all the gear I could bring,
so let us know in the
comments section too,
if you are missing the golden
microphone as much as I am.
Scratch that, lets move
on to a quick 80's style
Tech Yes lovin' shot.

So a little bit of an update now,
there's only half an hour
left on the multi benchmark
competition, and that started
at 10:30 and finishes at
three p.m., so they've only
got four and a half hours
in total, to win across those
four different benchmarks,
and currently, Lucky Noob
is still out in front
at number one, so this is
getting pretty tight-knit,
with some of the competitors
really racing to get
their scores validated and in
this case, they have to put
their hand up, and then have
an official come over and
validate the scores with pen and paper.
But after three p.m., then
the 20 competitors will
move across with an additional
two hours to then try
and break individual world records.
(jazzy electronic music)
So the competition has
concluded for the first round
of the multi benchmark competition where
each benchmark was
actually weighted 25% each,
and in the end, Bullshooter came in third,
knocking off Lucky Noob,
because his graphics card
managed to go above 2.5
gigahertz on the core.
Second place was awarded
to Dancop, who scored 2.55
on his RTX 2080 Ti, then
number one was Rauf,
coming in with a massive
2.6 gigahertz core clock,
and that enabled him to
win both the time spot and
Port Royal benchmarks, and
of course the CPU benchmarks
weighing in, but all the
top three competitors
did pretty well across
Cinebench and also Geekbench.
However, I was talking to
last year's winner, Alex Roe,
and this time around he just
came into some really bad luck,
his first RTX 2080 Ti, it just died,
and then his second one didn't do so well,
plus he had motherboard
issues where it was too wet,
so he had to replace his motherboard
during this competition, so this is what
it all comes down to on the
fly, when they're time strapped.
But now there's some additional time given
to all the competitors to
try and break world records,
so we're gonna get on inside
and see what magic can happen.
So I'm now standing
outside, and after two hours
of intense competition
for the world records,
nine in total were beaten,
those being Fire Strike,
Fire Strike Extreme,
3DMark 11, 3DMark Vantage,
Hardware Bot Prime and
also 3DMark 11 Physics,
Catzilla 720p, and also
GPUPI v. 3.3 for CPU 1B
and also the 100 M version.
Now another interesting thing
is that two of the records
were taken out by Mad, who is actually
the developer of the Hall
of Fame division with Galax,
so I guess that's a really cool thing
that Galax have employees that
not only design the products
but they're also enthusiasts themselves,
so everything from the
aesthetic to the VRM
to the PCB design is
made by an enthusiast.
And I guess that's why, in
ways, Galax are on the rise
in terms of being one of the
best GPU makers out there,
and certainly all of the
cards that have come through
on my channel have definitely
more than impressed me.
Whether it's been a premium
item or a value for money play,
they're definitely
covering both bases there.
Anyways guys, hope you
enjoyed today's coverage of
the GOC 2018 event in
Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh city,
if you did then be sure
to hit that Like button,
also the three winners were
announced and they got to
take home their prizes, as
well as the fact they're
giving away graphics cards,
and giving away some merch.
I scored myself a pretty
cool hoodie as well, but
it's pretty hot, I'm
not really gonna wear it
here in Vietnam.
Anyways guys, let us know in
the comments section below
what was your favorite part of the event.
Also, I'm meeting up with
viewers and subscribers,
thank you guys so much, love
each and every one of you.
This is Boo right here,
and he's taking me around Vietnam,
showing me some of the underground deals,
so they'll be another video
on top of the parts hunt,
so stay tuned for that, and
I'll catch you guys in another
tech video vary soon.
- [Boo] Peace out for now, bye!
(upbeat electronic music)
(static)
- [Host] So now, after two
hours of intense competitions
for the world records, the results are in,
and over nine world records
were broken that being
Fire Strike, also Fire Strike Extreme--
Ah.
Crap.
There's like a wedding going on.
Ha ha, oops.
