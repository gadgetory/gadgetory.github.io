from Japan is all graph table we got
power supplies and also monitor arms and
random stuff warm one of their arms and
also a p55 motherboard now I do have an
X 58 mobile that's cool on another box
so we're gonna start cleaning up this
whole setup it is really bad in here and
we're gonna start doing a transformation
welcome back to tech city and I'm just
gonna start getting my swag on so here's
a three power plays that I have to fix
up so this one here has a broken fan so
I'm gonna replace that with an antique
fan and those two needs SATA cables
spliced into them and then these shall
be usable once again
so I I just chucked out that other
soldiering I was just way too low-power
this one's uh it's fifty to a hundred
watts I need you know find myself liking
the higher what is soldering I've also
got some flux for it too so hopefully
the job will be easier now
so I just finished soldiering up these
here and taping them off so now there's
two functional power supplies with SATA
cables on them and this one here is now
got a new fan on it so it's going to be
very quiet
instead of it's gonna be quiet except
it's got a antique fan on it maybe it
should have had a big quiet fan on so
this is the setup here for my mom I'm
actually doing this as well because I've
got these two Korean 1440p panels here
now yes it is true my mum does need dual
monitor setup 1440p to play solitaire so
we're gonna finish this up now
all right so now that the other setups
done I now have to clean this up and
it's one absolute mess so the idea was
that I wanted to move the filing cabinet
into that room and then clean up this
table and have that as the test bench
table then that can be like the b-roll
table you've got to clean up some tables
too and I've got to install the sound
bar in there too and clean up these
cables like there and there so let's get
on with this one mate
okay so this rig is now kind of complete
I actually managed to fit this is the
bottom here is actually loose still but
I managed to actually get the side panel
on kind of well so with an attic cooler
in there so looks alright looks like
it's so good for a quick patch up but
let's get the rest of the setup done so
we've got a little bit of a problem here
the monitor stands won't go on because
yeah that's like flush with that so I
was thinking about putting that there
but that didn't work that's not strong
enough so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
get these tools down here and I'm gonna
hack this desk Oh
Oh
okay so we just Hulk smash this one on
as well and that's to monitor stands on
all ready to go
so Judah popular request I'm going to be
cooking up this graphics card so
apparently 210 degrees is the ghost so
we're gonna put this on and then pull it
out and see if it does anything but I've
already cooked up a graphics card before
and then I cooked it up even more for
lols and it didn't work both times but
let's give this a shot
so we just finished putting this in the
oven for around about eight minutes
after the oven heated up so let's just
quickly whack a cooler on here and see
if it turns on and gets a signal if
there's no signal coming out of this
thing then yeah bugger it
so there it is guys my setup is finally
complete I got the to monitor arms in
that allowed me to do more cable
management with those cables that I had
and also cleaning out those desks and uh
yeah making those mounts possible was a
real pain in the ass the cleanup process
took quite a while as well so you know
vacuuming all the mess left behind but
at the same time I got to clean
everything out rearrange my whole setup
so everything is so clean now I'll be
able to work a lot more efficiently
because I got more room to work with and
the test bench setup - is now setup so
I've got to put some products and stuff
and do some testing there so stay tuned
for that because there's something big
coming to the channel pretty soon and on
that note if you guys liked this setup
and be sure to hit that like button and
let me know in the comment section below
what is your setup all about you'll
probably notice that there's a lot more
RGB going on in my setups and that's
mething because I like I got given these
two RGB kits and then this is the katana
here I go to review that so stay tuned
for that review that's coming very soon
but yeah I guess I'm becoming an RGB
fanboy by default so that could just
can't be helped
hey guys I'll catch you on another tech
video very soon and also if you want to
check out what gear I use not just in
gaming and whatnot but also for
recording and all that stuff then I'll
put a link in the description below for
kit comm and also if you haven't already
then jump onto the new website with the
forums and join up and discuss all
things tech and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye
so now pick this up on gumtree for about
50 AUD and that's gonna go in here and I
told you guys I wasn't lying all's been
serious we're gonna try this oven Cod
you know oven graphics card fix souls we
need for this is just a trusty old
crappy intel heatsink there just to
balance it then we just put it on the
corner there right on the corner okay
good to go and then we just drop it in
the oven and we leave that on for 10
minutes now man that stinks Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
