I am going to be finally doing a budget
$50 or less headphones shootout for you
guys a lot of people requested I do this
a long time ago and I just I finally got
around to it doing it now another thing
I'm gonna say is there's also this big
audio fad moving through the tech world
and I'm jumping on the train as well but
thing is I'm just gonna duel these audio
videos and then I'm just gonna slash
quit audio again and get back to the
good juicy tech stuff I've done all the
research for it I've come to a lot of
conclusions that just got to make a lot
of videos and get all that information
out there for you guys now but today
we're going to be reviewing six
contenders and they're all priced at $50
or less and now for the testing
mythology I am using the onboard audio
as I believe if you're getting a headset
at this price range you're most likely
going to be using it with the onboard
audio now for reference 10 out of 10
we're gonna be using the Fidelio x ones
as a 10 out of 10 reference so how do
these compare to the Fidelio x ones in
terms of clarity and soundstage and
stuff like that but let's look at the
contenders first also I'm gonna have a
bit of background music in the
background so let me know if you guys
like that I'm gonna try some new things
out so let me know if you like the
background music as well but anyway
let's get on with the contenders first
up we had the le com $9 bargains special
now these are $9 you'd probably expect
them to sound nasty and I'll get onto
them whether they do later next up in
line we had the razor carcases from
razor these or a gaming headset come
with a mick and they actually don't look
too shabby so these are about $50 I
believe next we have inline the is K
83,000 s now these will set you back
about $30 they are a relatively unknown
brand and I wanted to test some unknown
brands because I wanted to get some
different impressions and I wanted to do
see if there was any winners out there
in this head bracket headphone in the
$50.00 market next up we have the JT s5
three 5s from a company called JT s
relatively unknown company as well these
are only $20 so I'll be talking about
these as well and then we have the audio
technica Pro mark ones from their DJ
portable head
and I'll talk about these as well and
then last in line we have the KSC 75 s
from costs now these are a clear winner
and I'll talk about these at the end
they're the winner of today's shootout
they're the winner but I'll talk about
that I've been deaf there's also another
two winners and I'll talk about them as
well mention whether they're winners but
let's get on with the first pet a pair
of headphones or headsets this is the
abomination for nine dollars these
things sounded absolutely terrible
they're wood junk when I when I put this
on I never heard a sound this bad before
they even sounded worse more worse than
my Toyotas or my old car which had a
hole in the speaker that's how bad these
sounded the bass was just distorting the
midst sounded muffled you know you could
barely hear voices were barely audible
with this thing so I mean this thing was
advertised for Skype sure I mean it
could do Skype the kid just it was junk
I'm not gonna recommend this at all if
you have nine dollars seriously save
your money
do not go avoid these things like the
plague next up we have the razor carcase
gaming headset now I know some people
like it's pronounced carcass or whatever
I I've never used the word in my life so
again I do sorry if I pronounced it
wrong but these are a gaming headset and
now as you guys know the gaming headsets
they're not the audio quality is not as
good as an audiophile headphone and
that's fair enough but I will after
hearing those $9 junk headphones I will
say one thing about these and that is
they don't sound that bad I mean if
someone gave these to me and they said
look you know you can have these and I
didn't have anything else around my
house I could get by with these they're
actually really comfortable these weigh
in at 220 grams roughly and that's what
the microphone and the cable attached so
they are really comfortable 10 out of 10
for comfort long gaming sessions on
these things absolutely no problems
there's I think that there's semi-open
yeah they're open headphones as well so
you can hear what's going on outside
there's a little bit of sound leakage
and the microphones pretty bad but it
works
everything on these headphones works
headset works it is feature pay it's
gotten you know it's got the clip here
which lets you adjust the volume and
mute the mic if you need to the mics
also swivel so you can take it up and
down and ultimately if functionality
this thing is actually good you know
coughed comfort and functionality this
thing gets a 10 out of 10 it's not it's
really good the designs also pretty cool
I said the sound quality is just not
that good and the mic quality is pretty
bad as well but I'd give these about a
four and a half out of ten five out of
ten for audio I mean that the base is
not detailed at all the mids are a bit
muddy the highs are a bit muddy but you
know they work so I mean if you want
something and you don't care about sound
too much but you want something that
works then I can recommend these they're
not that bad I mean if you can pick them
up on a fire sale and you want a boom
mic and you want these this clip thing
it's not they're not that bad I've
really been a bit too harsh on these you
know these sound like a saint compared
to those nine dollar pieces of junk so
they're not bad so but they're not a
winner today they're not a winner
they're definitely not a winners anyway
let's move on now to the next pair of
headphones these are the eighty-three
thousands from isk now these are a
winner in today's competition I'll be
doing a review of these for you guys
they're a relatively unknown brand from
ISK I've never heard of them before
I saw them and now a $30 and they weigh
in the same as the racecar cast the way
aren't 220 grams except in my opinion
these would conflict score 11 out of 10
these are the most comfortable
headphones I've ever put on my head in
my life
Wow god damn phenomenal design for that
these guys really deserve kudos for
making that just an amazing comfortable
design I mean maybe it's just my head
they might be more uncomfortable on
different heads but for my head Wow
really freaking comfortable good thing
about these as to is they're closed if
you need a closed back set of headphones
like if I'm if everything's noisy
outside I need to listen to things put
these on and I won't hear much noise
outside they also don't leak hardly any
noise at all so they're really good in
that regard if you need a closed back
headphone comfort amazing let's talk
about sound seeing
another thing too is the cable is a
straight cable I do like the straight
cables I'm not a fan of the coiled
cables and I'll talk about that when I
mean look at a coiled cable headphone
but yeah the sound signature of these
let's talk about the sound signature
they're a bit flat the base isn't really
there the mids not really there the
highs aren't really there is just a flat
headphone the clarity is pretty good
though I got to admit the mids and the
highs they've got pretty good clarity
they're low sensitivity so on the
onboard audio when I turn it up to 100
they'll still kind of lacking a little
bit so when I hooked them up to the o2
plus my creative Z I noticed that they
came a little bit more to life and they
had a bit more balls and they could pay
it play the sound they're really cool
when I hooked them up to that amplifier
so I don't I liked these headphones I
mean I like them I can recommend them
for $30 even at a hundred volume I mean
that's comfortable listening levels
maybe it's just a little bit deafening
if you go with a headphone amp but yeah
a hundred that were good so that they're
doable these things are cool I like them
I can recommend them ok let's move on
now to the next headphones these are the
JT s5 three 5s now company called JT as
I've never heard of them either before
these are a studio monitor headphone and
they I mean they they're comfortable I
wouldn't say they're as comfortable as
the 83 thousands or the calf cases but I
can see you can do definitely do long
gaming sessions on these there it's
weird though that the force kind of
tends to clamp around sort of here so
they kind of sit a little bit loose on
your ears a little bit it's weird
they're kind of semi open as well so
you'll be able to hear a little bit of
noise coming in and they won't leak as
much as an open back headphone so
they're kind of a balance and now
there's one really good thing about
these these are another winner and I'm
gonna tell you why the sound signature
of these is pretty cool for 20 dollars
they have one thing that none of my
other headphones have in my house and
that is their seismic these things
Rumble when you put enough power through
them they started rumbling and it's
really for me I love it it's immersive I
like a bit of Rumble so I've now got a
fun rumbling pair of headphones
house so even if you guys are on a
budget and you kind of want a fun
headphone these are definitely it now
let's talk about the bass the bass
obviously is nowhere near as good as the
Fidelio x1 it's not as the clarity is
not as good the detail and the bass not
as good but the bass is there when I
played Katy Perry's song raw that was
really cool for these headphones I
thought it sounded the best on these
headphones is just cool it's a lot of
fun they rumbled you kind of you can
hear the tiger and it's like
everything's rumbling like yeah this is
awesome so it was a really fun feeling
the mids and the highs were a little bit
muffled but they were smooth this was
ultimately a smooth headphone for anyone
who wants a smooth sounding headphone I
can highly recommend these if you and
your a little bit bass orientated so
these are a bit of AB AC headphone and I
do like them and they are they hold a
special place around here because
they're seismic now one negative thing
is though that you've got the coiled
cable I'm not a fan of the coiled cable
because it's more for a DJ in my opinion
I mean you've got the DJ at the mixing
table they've got it plugged in and you
know they're close to their plug so they
don't really need they can use the cable
and when they need to reach things they
can just pull it out occasionally and
then it comes back in and it's good I
mean it's good for a DJ but when I've
got this on my desktop and I'm plugging
it into my desktop it's like I've got
this constant freaking force that I got
to pull against this way yeah oh yeah
tug of war on my freaking head so I'm
not a big fan of the cloud cable I don't
like it there is a way to get out of
that though you can kind of hook this to
your chair and be a bit of a ninja and
then sort of stretch it out that's
probably like a good way to fix it when
you just cut the freaking thing off and
wire up your own cable if you want to
but yeah for $20 these definitely get a
good recommendation that's they also
wait they're pretty lightweight as well
so they weigh a little bit they're a
little bit heavier than the car chaos
and the 83 thousands but you know the
comforts still there so good headphone
by jts the audio technica pro mark ones
these are a portable DJ headphone now
the sound signature of these is that
they got nice tight punchy bass and
they're also pretty
I guess bright they've got a I guess a
boost in the treble I think I don't know
I'm not too sure but then ultimately the
sound signature for me was a little bit
it didn't have body I guess that's the
way to describe it it was kind of
missing something especially for rock if
I listen to rock it exposed the real
weakness in these headphones and that is
it just didn't have much warmth to it
they're a cold headphone in my opinion
now they the one thing good thing about
these is that they do look pretty damn
cool I think a lot of people have been
asking me what this what are these
headphones they look pretty cool and I
agree they do look pretty cool the
comfort though the comfort you're a
gamer I do not recommend these because
after a long amount of time they kind of
on your ears they start to press and
your easel get sore that's one thing
that's bad about these we're talking
long gaming sessions about two hours or
so is about is fine when we start
venturing into the four hour sessions
that's when they start to get sore and
tiring they got a coiled cable as well
which I don't like but ultimately
they're not bad if you can pick these up
and you want a portable set of
headphones and you occasionally game
then I couldn't recommend these as well
they're pretty cool just know that
they're kind of I think they're called
headphone okay now lastly we're gonna
move on now to the KSC 75s these word
the clear winner today out of all the
headphones I want to save the best till
last because when I first read about
these everyone was recommending and
saying look these things are good and I
kind of got them and I thought it's a
little bit cheap but then I weighed them
they weigh 30 grams so they're pretty
damn light they weigh 30 grams I started
the audio Technica's are about the same
weight as the jts 5 3 5 s about 200 cm
anything but these weigh 30 grams and
they're really comfortable you put them
on your ears and they definitely score a
10 out of 10 for comfort
once you clip them in to your ears they
they sit on your ears really well there
so they're comforted they're great for
exercising if I'm going for a jog I wear
these things and they just are amazing I
love them better than earphones
and I am they're just really cool they
sit on your ears good for the gym now
the cables a little bit short but if you
get a 1 meter extension that's not gonna
be a problem
but let's talk about the best thing of
these headphones they're only $16 these
headphones are clip-on it's only 16
dollars or 15 dollars I got them for $15
and Wow Wow the sound signature of these
things is phenomenal
you've got that nice bump in the mids
they've got a little bit of bass there
they just sound phenomenal with rock the
best earphones I have here for rock I
mean and I've got the Fidelio X ones
actually they're the same as my ghetto
highs as I put them on the same level as
my ghetto houses they sound better for
rock than my $300
Fidelio x ones I mean that says a lot
about these KSC 75 now the soundstage is
not obviously as good as the X ones or
my ghetto houses but the soundstage is
decent and so if you're a gamer on the
budget I can highly recommend these
because you got that bump in the mid
that's if you're a gamer you're gonna
want that because you got the you've got
the gunfire and the footsteps and the
voice is all coming out in the mids so
that's where you want that bump and this
is where it has it now if you're if you
love rock and metal as well these things
are gonna be for you
absolutely phenomenal I really can
thoroughly recommend these things they
are freaking awesome $15 I was damn
impressed the one that I mean another
negative is at the build quality is a
little bit weak so I can you know they
they do break relatively easy so they
are a little bit fragile but I mean for
God for $16
they just pooped on everything here I
couldn't believe it they were just that
good so honestly case cost did a
absolutely phenomenal job with these
headphones these clip ons and I can
recommend these these are the winner
today and I'll be redoing a review of
these the JTF 535 s and the 83,000 for
you guys and I hope you enjoyed the
budget headphones shootout today and if
you have any questions or comments
