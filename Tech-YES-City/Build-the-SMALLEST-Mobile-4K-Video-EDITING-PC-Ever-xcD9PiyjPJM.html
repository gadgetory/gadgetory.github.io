is the in wind Chopin and it's going to
host a really awesome build I'm gonna be
using it for editing 4k footage while
I'm on the road and also since I'm
leaving for pax Isles in literally less
than 12 hours
I need something to build quick I need
it to be small and even smaller than
some of those mini ITX pcs are built in
the past and they've been really small
but this thing is extremely small it's
almost the size of my hand
it's just that small so let's find out
what we've got in this PC and how it
performs as well welcome back to tech
yeah City this is brian coming to you
guys today with another mini ITX build
and first of all I'm gonna say ddr4
memory prices are just ridiculously
expensive at the moment I couldn't
believe it the kid that I bought last
year at PAX America for $159 this was -
16 gigabyte sticks of Crucial Ballistix
got it for a really good deal at Myra
center this memory is now three hundred
and fifteen dollars on Amazon I couldn't
believe it $200 price hike from what I
originally paid for it
now this build would have came to about
nine hundred dollars if you guys paid
the same what I pay for some of the
parts along the way that makes any sense
but this build will now cost you eleven
hundred and sixty three dollars to build
it is quite expensive of course on that
note I will put some cheaper
alternatives in the description below if
you want to build something similar but
you want it to be for a home theater PC
for example but what we have here today
is strictly a video editing PC so
there's actually no graphics card
installed and you're probably wondering
don't you need CUDA support and the
answer is yes and no CUDA support I find
generally works when you're putting in
effects your color balancing and it also
does speed up the final render time but
since I'm traveling usually I'm doing
long interviews and also showing off the
latest products and you don't really
need a lot of color balancing and fancy
effects for that so something like this
with the six core i5 8400 will do an
excellent job now I recently tested this
six core CPU from the coffee leg lineup
and it's really good value for money not
only that it just sips power doesn't use
much power at all especially compared to
the overclockable
i7 8700 K and even its bigger variant
the i5 8600 K when they're both
overclocked they use
considerable amount more power now since
this case only has a 150 watt power
supply in it I want to keep the power
consumption low but I also need the
power so the i5 8400 is perfect for this
build
and as rocker as you can see behind me
they've sent out to Z 370 mini ITX
motherboards I also bought 2 i5 8400 s
and also 2 in wind chopping so I will be
doing a giveaway of one of these in wind
chop ins to you guys in the next week or
so it's coming in early November I'll be
teaming up with three other tech
channels so stay tuned for that stay
subscribed with notifications on because
you're not gonna want to miss this
giveaway of one of these little sexy
cases here now getting back on topic
with the parts the i5 8400 187 dollars
that's what I paid for it and it should
be back in stock pretty soon so
definitely worth the money it also comes
with a cooler does a pretty good job you
can hear it beside me it's currently on
and it's really quiet now the in wind
choppin which is the best part of this
build I absolutely love this case I saw
it online the photos I got recommended
it by a friend and then I got it in the
flesh and it was even better than what I
thought it would be in the photos and
what I heard about it all metal
construction absolutely love this case
it's got the mesh on the sides on the
top and also it's gotten USB 3 at the
front audio in and out ports and a 150
watt power supply which is bronze rated
included at the bottom this is a small
form-factor power supply and the cables
are all black as well and the cable
management in this case is so easy which
really surprised me for a mini ITX case
also the rear you can mount a 3.5 inch
hard drive and an SSD or two SSDs if you
wish
now the Z 370 Mini ITX bought from
asrock this comes included with an nvme
slot so you can mount one of those it's
also a feature pack board three fan
headers four pin fan headers two RAM
slots and a USB three front out it's
also got a seven phase vrm and wireless
bluetooth included the for the pricing
with the in wind chop and this is where
things get a little bit tricky I
couldn't find this for sale anywhere in
the US and in fact the cheapest price
you could get it for in the US was
getting it shipped from someone on eBay
in Australia which came to around 100
35 USD which actually isn't too bad now
if you're in a straight you can pick
this up from PC case gear like I did for
a hundred and nine Australian dollars
this is the black version they also have
the silver version too though I do
prefer the black version and they
include the green orange and blue I
think and red colour bands that you can
use to change the build up a little bit
if you so wish now touching on the
pricing with the Mini ITX z3 70
motherboard this is the fatality version
really good vrm as I said before and it
comes in at a hundred and eighty dollars
so it is feature pack but it is a little
bit expensive especially for a Mini ITX
board they do have the cheaper ITX AC
version which comes in at 135 dollars
you can also get a $10 rebate so at 125
dollars that motherboard is definitely
representing pretty good value for money
even on an 8400 because you can then
overclock the memory and even little
things like the B clock are bump that up
3% and that will give you a little
performance boost especially compared to
the B 360 motherboards which will be
more expensive than standard B 360
motherboards if they're in the Mini ITX
format there was for the last component
in this build the storage we're going
with a one terabyte SSD from Corsair now
this is a lot of storage for an SSD
although if you're on the road like me
editing 4k video footage with a hundred
megabits per second a one terabyte SSD
can quickly fill up before you know it
you're juggling space and it's just a
nightmare
if you don't have enough storage on your
hands though you can step it down of
course for much cheaper there are 240
gear by des SDS for around $75
especially if you're making a home
theater PC something like that will come
in a lot cheaper now this brings the
total cost of this build to eleven
hundred and sixty three dollars which is
really expensive for what it is
the ddr4 memory prices just simply make
this build exorbitantly expensive it
come in at around nine hundred and
something dollars if it wasn't for that
price hike on the ddr4 memory but keep
in mind I need something like this for
editing 4k footage on the road I can't
compromise any more than I have there's
a little bit of good news to come out of
this if you are an Aussie you can pick
this whole build up for around thirteen
hundred and seventy four Australian
dollars which brings it in a 1059 us
in relative prosperity purchasing terms
that just simply means if you were to
convert the Australian dollars into US
dollars that's what the price would be
in USD though we do pay 10% GST tax as
well so the builds looking pretty good
in Australia I mean the prices in the US
has built something like this is just
simply a ripoff at the moment but err
guys enough talking about the price of
this thing let's talk about the
performance the 8,400 we can get this
thing to around 950 Cinebench score out
of the box I will be tuning it a little
bit more and of course under vaulting it
to see the best settings that I can get
on this current setup though what about
gaming of course I'm using the onboard
Intel graphics which isn't that good
though the performance actually
surprised me when it came to 1080p
gaming dota 2 at 1080p on the lowest
settings but with a hundred percent
resolution scale was pulling around 60
to 80 frames per second which was
absolutely fine for an enjoyable
experience and also on that note it was
extremely snappy moving over to csgo
this is where things got a little bit
weird 1080p was kind of like 60 frames
per second it was okay but it was
stuttering in clutch battles so I did
have to drop it to 720p and it was at
that stage that the FPS did boost a
little there was still some - stutters
going on so it was a little bit weird in
csgo though I did manage to get some
frags at 720p settings and of course I
know you guys would get angry if I
didn't test out pub G how does it
perform in player unknowns battlegrounds
well it was terrible to say the least
720p lowest settings very low and now
even dropped it down to 70% resolution
scale I think and we got around 15 to 20
frames per second and it was funny
because even though the frame rates were
horrible there are actually pastes out
extremely well this was the if I dare
say it the smoothest 15 to 20 fps I've
ever had in my life I could actually
frag some people on these settings
though when it came to the end game I
really couldn't see the players that
well amy was so hard because it was just
literally pixels on my screen it was
just a horrible picture to begin with
I'd like to play at least at 1080p
very low settings to actually do well at
this game and of course the main task at
hand video editing this thing is going
to perform really well when I'm using it
for Adobe Premiere Pro and of course
Adobe Audition it is extremely small as
well I'll be able to put into my bag
with my camera gear 4 packs oz and also
next month for the event in Bangkok
anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this
little video on the in wind choppin it
is a fantastic case and it's actually
been released for quite some time now I
just was unaware of it but honestly with
the new coffee lake chips the six cores
the 8400 in particular with this case in
a mini ITX board it is going to be an
absolutely amazing combo for someone who
needs it for what I need it for and
that's mobile video editing so powerful
so small can highly recommend it though
the prices really keep your eyes out for
deals especially on ddr4 memory anyway
guys if you have any questions about the
in wind choppin then let me know in the
comment section below what do you think
of it and also if you like the silver
version better love reading your
thoughts and opinions as always and also
stay tuned because there's going to be a
big giveaway coming which I'll be giving
away here on the channel and also
teaming up with three other tech
channels and they'll all be giving away
a PC of their own it should be an
international giveaway so stay tuned for
that and also if you're going to pax
Australia in Melbourne let me know I
look forward to seeing you there having
a chat catching up and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
