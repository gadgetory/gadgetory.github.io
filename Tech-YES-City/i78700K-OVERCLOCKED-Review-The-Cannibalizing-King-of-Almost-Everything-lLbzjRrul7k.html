the CPU market especially thanks to
Andy's rise in CPU lineup for instance
you could get their rise in 5 1600 CPU
with the cooler included and an
inexpensive be 350 motherboard and
overclock it to really good levels this
represented extremely good value for
money
to the point where until seventh
generation CPUs were no longer seen as a
really decent option for people looking
for good price performance however
fast-forwarding to October 2017 marks
the release of coffee'd Lake Intel's
eighth generation CPUs some say this was
rushed to market as a forced response to
rising and quite frankly I agree the
stock levels being quite low especially
for the CPU I'm reviewing today the 8700
K though with that aside let's take a
look at the gaming benchmarks
productivity and also throw in some
streaming and temperature results for
you guys too
welcome back to tech yes City this is
brian coming to you guys today with the
8700 k review now you guys have been
hitting me up on twitter and comment
sections and all the threads requesting
i get this review out and i would have
got it out sooner but there was a big
mix-up in my supply however as Rach did
come through with a motherboard and also
an 8700 k both of which i'm using in
today's review so big thank you to as
rocker we've got the gaming i7 fatality
motherboard on display rock-solid board
really good for overclocking the vrm
temperatures are good as well which I'll
show in an upcoming video but with that
aside you guys probably want to know how
this thing performs all bs aside so
let's take a look at those numbers
it
so as you guys just saw in those
benchmarks ti7 8700 k is legit this
thing is really kicking it to the
competition and it's even cannibalizing
Intel's own CPU lineup I honestly don't
see the purpose of the 7800 X or a 7820
X anymore even a 7900 X is going to be a
really tough sell for Intel now because
the Z 370 chips and of course the 8700 K
is going to be a lot cheaper than the
next $2.99 motherboard and a 7900 X the
only reason I could really see someone
going for that of course is that quad
channel memory the extra PCIe lanes and
if they could utilize those extra cores
and threads and if they did then they
might want to consider the 1950 X as
well which has 16 cores and 32 threads
but what we've got here on display is a
6 core 12 threaded Beast now people will
say it's only 2 more cause for more
threads over the 7700 K and that's
exactly what it is the thing is however
it's 2 more cause for more threads on
the ring bus architecture which is an
extremely low latency architecture which
is great for gaming and not only that it
does productivity extremely well now
practically with the 50% boost for 30
more dollars so it's really easy to see
how the 8700 K is extremely relevant in
2017 I like to think of it as the new
5820k when that was first released that
was extremely good value for money the
only problem back in 2014 was that games
didn't need 6 cores 12 threads
fast forward that to 2017 games can now
utilize those extra cores and threads
and of course that balance with
productivity makes us a serious
contender not just for gamers but also
for people who are doing productivity as
a best in slot CPU as we could see with
that Adobe Audition benchmark which is
still a single-threaded test the 8700 K
was winning those benchmarks now there's
other things that I do on my computer
like Photoshop what about boot times
everything's going to be faster when it
comes to single threaded performance
with the 8700 ok that's something that
the competition and even intel's
higher-end lineup of cpus can't
currently match which is why the 8700 K
really is a shining star despite all the
negative attention it's getting and of
course the dodgy things that Intel do as
a company but on that note of Dodge
Intel I don't know how many times have
to say please stop using thermal paste
to connect the guide of the IHS people
in my comments section refused to buy
your product just because you're simply
doing this and I'm sure would only cost
you a little bit extra to implement this
on your cpu you could even charge this
on to the customer for three hundred and
sixty four dollars instead of three
hundred sixty dollars and I'm sure
people would be glad to pay the
difference I know I definitely would
instead of having to run down daily the
thing buy some liquid thermal paste and
then drop it on there and hope and pray
that it runs better and also on that
note I've just voided my warranty but
with all that aside we could see in the
temperature test that the 8700 k
benefits a lot from a daily I couldn't
even get this thing stable at five
gigahertz without deleting it emitted
into the bench market would crash and
fail and then after I deleted it it was
perfectly stable however on that note
there is a setting in the BIOS that you
will want to enable I found this helped
a lot with stability it was the offset
with the ring to the core ratio I had to
set this to enabled and then I found
stability at 1.33 volt on LLC level of
one but also on that note the software
is miss reading the voltages especially
cpuid in height of 64 other programs
like hardware monitor are kind of
getting it right but even with that
they're showing weird numbers especially
when it came to the LLC scaling that's
the load line calibration so hopefully
some BIOS updates and some new software
updates can fix this is even though it's
the 1151 socket until have changed it
around to allow more power delivery to
these six core 12 threaded CPUs and also
the six core six threaded CPUs like the
80 600 K they're looking further into
the gaming benchmarks we could just see
that this CPU was an absolute beast for
gaming if you're into competitive gaming
this thing is quite simply the best
couple that was streaming it's still the
best it's beating the 7900 x2 as a
streaming CPU now whether that changes
into 2018-2019 is still up for debate
however on that note for now it's a
really snappy architecture the ring boss
is extremely good for competitive gaming
but on that note GTA 5 we look at a game
like that it did have some stuttering
and this caused some weird numbers and
when I researched around apparently this
game is just getting that many frames on
the 8700 K that is breaking the end
so I did witness this when I was testing
it in 4k where it was no longer
stuttering because the frame rates were
now lower due to the 4k demand on the
graphics card so that is a weird anomaly
however GTA 5 it's not a competitive
game so I will exclude that and even if
it was a competitive game I'm sure they
would patch this problem because
competitive gamers would have a field
day with it if this was implemented in
the game like csgo or dota 2 for example
or pub G though moving on into pub G it
was actually this CPU that made me
realise that this game had a hard lock
in the frame rates of course pub G did
recently get a patch as well for better
utilization of CPU core sauce probably
this patch coupled with the 8700 K that
made me realise this however the 8700 K
is the best for pub G players both
streamed and non streamed benchmarks
moving on into dota 2 extremely smooth
we were getting near 240 FPS a lot of
the times throughout playing this game
and also even in heavy battles it was
really only dipping down to like 170 180
FPS so it was extremely capable
especially if you're a competitive dota
2 player looking at csgo again the best
frame rates I've seen yet I showed just
how powerful this thing was with some
plays and csgo in my recent build video
so if you want to check that out I've
put a link in the description below and
also another game that really stood out
was Far Cry primal of course this game
really is related to a CPUs latency I
find the better the CPUs latency is with
the latency controller and built into
the CPU itself the better frame rates
you generally get of course coupled with
IPC and other things like clock speeds
this can give you a result that can very
quiet greatly from CPU to CPU though
that last benchmark of course that I'm
going to pull up for you guys is f1 2016
4k we see here practically no difference
if you're playing in 4k so it doesn't
really matter what new aged CPU use 4k
gaming any CPU will pretty much be fine
as the graphics card is getting really
stressed at 4k this is with the GT X
1080 Ti so if you guys are a casual
gamers and you just care about getting a
really good experience and of course
something like a Rison v 1600 b through
the motherboard stock cooler it's gonna
be great value for money and then you
can go spend extra money on a graphics
card however you guys want the best
frame rates possible and you want to CPU
that will last you for a couple of
in the 8700 k is a serious contender for
your money of course you have to get a Z
370 chipset which is more expensive than
it be through the motherboard but on
that note you will have to get a better
cooler as well because at 150 watts this
thing does demand a decent cooler I was
using the H 110 i from Corsair does a
great job and as I stated before I had
to deal with this CPU which you don't
have to do on the rise and CPUs so now
it's time to conclude the video was
saying out of the big three companies
Intel Nvidia and AMD it seems like Intel
does pull the most shadiest stuff out
there though with that aside this poor
8700 K he was brought into this world he
didn't have a say and I'm just gonna
review this CPU on its merits itself and
what you're getting if you can pick it
up for 360 US dollars which is a
different topic altogether on its retail
price 360 USD it is one beast of a CPU
for me personally it's the best in slot
out there by far it's a really fast CPU
it's extremely snappy for doing my Adobe
Premiere work suite it's extremely fast
and not only that the gaming numbers as
well for gaming this thing is just
extremely fast too so it's one of those
CPUs that's hitting really hard for its
price and a couple with the Z 370
motherboards you can pick them up for
around about 120 dollars that's the
asrock pro 4 and that will do a pretty
good job of overclocking too of course I
did use the gaming i7 which does have
better MOSFETs and a vrm on board as
opposed to the Z 370 pro 4 but with that
said it won't give you that big of a
difference as it's still only using 150
watts it's 50 watts more than the 7700 K
and it's got 50% more cores and threads
so the power consumption is scaling
quite similar to the 7700 K the one that
noticed still does use more power than
an 1800 X so it is technically less
efficient at 5 gigahertz versus 4
gigahertz on an 1800 X guys hope you
enjoyed today's review if you did that
be sure to give it a big thumbs up and
let me know in the comments section
below what you think about the i7 8700 k
if it was in stock today I mean it seems
to be sold out everywhere
would you buy one if not why if so why
love reading your comments and thoughts
as always and I'll catch you
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
