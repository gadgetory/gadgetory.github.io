welcome back to tech yeah City this is
brian coming to you guys today with the
review of the creative Iroh portable
speaker this is their flagship speaker
which honestly not only does beats out
the roar - it beats out any other
portable speaker that I can think of now
let's get straight on to business with
this unit it features five different
speakers dedicated audio and an
additional speaker dedicated to voice in
the center now two of the side speakers
are dedicated for bass and the
dimensions come in exactly the same as
the raw two before it now it also
features a 9,000 mile lithium battery
which gave me about twelve hours of use
of 50% volume which was extremely loud
even a 50 percent volume and it only
took around two hours to charge the
device now looking at the finish and
design it is a piano gloss black finish
and it looks absolutely amazing in my
opinion though it does fingerprint very
easy in certain types of light so be
mindful of that I'm moving up to the top
of the unit that we have the power
button which if you press it it'll turn
the unit on hold it for two seconds
it'll turn on bluetooth pairing also
this unit features NFC or near field
communication so if you put your
smartphone up to it it will then pair it
with the device and it will give you
audio confirmation that the unit is
paired now besides that we have the
track selection buttons and the play and
pause buttons which are touch operated
besides that we have the raw feature
which has two modes which you can turn
on and off and then besides that we've
got the beam mic feature which we'll get
onto both a audio in and audio out test
later and besides that we have the
volume indicator there as well as a call
pickup and hang up button which you can
change the volume all the way from mute
and then 0 to 20 and that 20 this unit
gets extremely loud now moving on the
outer edge on the top of this device
from right to left we have the phone
charging USB port besides that we have
the optical limb besides that we have
the auxiliary or audio import there for
the 3.5 millimeter jack then we've got
the loop and shuffle switch there below
that we have the microSD port there for
recording if you wish to use it as
recording or use it as playback as well
besides that we have the micro USB audio
port there and besides that we have the
actual manual power AC in port there
then moving on to the rear of this
device we've got the elastic bands there
in the creative logo on a matte black
finish which allows this unit to grip
pretty much any surface I can think of
without moving then moving along the
all the top depends on how you mount
this device you've got there two
speakers which are dedicated to mids and
then in the middle you've got an
additional speaker dedicated to treble
and you're probably wondering ere Brian
I know this thing looks great but how
does it actually perform what that being
said let's get on with a bus audio out
and Mike in tests
here's a test with the raw creative
onboard mic with mic beam turned off
from about a meter away now we're
talking about 50 centimeters away from
the mics this is with again mic being
turned off mic being turned off now
we'll get about 50 centimeters away from
the unit and do the exact same tests so
this is what the mics sound like in my
beat mode also before I move on to a
conclusion I'll quickly talk about the I
roll mic which is an optional accessory
that you can get to couple with the I
roar and now the sound quality is really
good going into this unit it's also very
easy to pair up with the AI Roy you
essentially just turn it on press a
button and you're done you've also got
the mute feature of volume features and
also on the bottom you have a micro USB
allowing you to use this as an audio
device with something else also you've
got there the audio in on an auxilary
and also a line in if you wish to use a
different device to plug into your I
roar and it comes with a windscreen
shield which attaches via a magnet
though how does it sound let's move on
to a sound test so now we're going to
use the attached creative overall
projector mic and couple it with the
system and now you'll probably notice
the sound is a little bit crazy but this
is because it's recording into the
camera my voice and the voice coming out
of this speaker however the great
benefit of this is that you can use this
in your lectures if you're a university
lecturer or a teacher and then even if
the volume isn't loud enough off this
device you can then use the optical out
to plug it into a bigger speaker system
so functionality on this thing is
absolutely incredible
now another cool feature of this unit is
you can actually change your voice on
the fly so if I want to do sir instance
a female voice
so in conclusion alls I'm gonna say is I
love it when a company takes a product
like the raw to and then they make it
even better and that's what creative
have done here actually they're not only
made it better they've made it in a
different league this thing is just
absolutely amazing the volume is just
bullshit like I can't believe how loud
this thing can go without distorting for
a portable not only that the accompany
mic beans on board are actually really
good for voice work albeit they're not
the best audio I've ever heard going
into it they will service you as a
gaming substitute if you're using it
with a laptop or if you're making simple
phone calls I never had a problem
hearing voices with this thing then
we'll talk about the IRA or mic now that
thing was having great audio quality
going into it I was really impressed
with the voice that was going into that
unit and coming out of the eye roar so
if you're a lecturer or whatnot all you
need to use this as a PA system and this
thing is definitely going to service
your needs
then lastly I'll talk about some of
those extra features I mean you can use
this thing with a laptop a Playstation 4
use it with your phone you can use it
with an Xbox one I mean the list goes on
it's just got so much features and
utility packed into it and not only that
if you need something to function as a
public announcement speaker then this
thing will service the job then lastly
creative have also included a software
package which you can install on your
desktop machine this will unlock extra
features like EQ curves and also
different profiles that you can change
and also you've got those sound profile
features where you can turn your male
voice into a female or an emo voice or
if you're a female you can do the
opposite so you've really got some cool
features packed in there and with that
being said I'm gonna give this thing
four and a half stars out of five I
thought it was absolutely incredible
what they've done with the unit though
the one drawback is the price it is a
very expensive portable speaker coming
in at 370 recommended retail price
though it is in my opinion just a
leagues ahead of any other portable
speaker I've heard today not only the
sound quality but also the volume then
you've got the accompanied features and
utilities like coupling it up with that
bluetooth microphone and all the other
software packages in voice changing
software this thing gets a real big
recommendation from me even though it is
a little bit
anyway that's all for me today guys if

that thumbs up button if you have any
questions or comments about the eye roll
or the I roll mic then be sure to drop a

I'll get back to you as soon as I can
