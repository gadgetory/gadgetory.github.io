rig for you guys and we're using a lot
of invidious samples because I've
actually sold all my AMD cards off with
this etherion booth and Steve was kind
enough from hardware unbox to sent us
over a lot of his samples as well so if
this is profitable of course I will be
cutting in him on those profits and also
we've got here the rising giveaway
pieces so six korazin mdx 370
motherboard that is getting built in the
near future and given away on the
channel to stay tuned for that so this
build is not going to cost me a whole
lot I did manage to pick up two asrock
each one 70s on eBay they were going on
sale last month with that eBay sale so I
got two of them 15% off and also got to
force early 200s Corsair were kind
enough to send them out and I've got an
i3 spare a3 here so I'm going to use
that as a cpu with the onboard graphics
and Steve also had a spare i3 around so
the other parts really we're going to be
using these h1 seventies as they have
five PCIe slots onboard hopefully they
all work I'm also still waiting on the
riser cable so today's going to be like
part one of this build where I'm just
showing you some of the parts that I've
got sort of setting it up preliminary
and then we are going to do part two
where I'm going to show you what
programs and what currencies I'll try to
mine and see if they're profitable for
you guys but let's get into this thing
and let's start building it so here's
the GPU rocky I got my friend to make
this up for me because he's into
woodworking and you can see there the
graphics card will actually just sit on
this rack then you'll have your
motherboard and power supply nearby and
the riser cables coming off the
motherboard however since we don't have
the riser cables just yet what I'm going
to do is I'm going to just leave this
off for now and then maybe just set up
like four GPUs until the other gear
arrive
this is the first mining rig set up here
I'm waiting on the riser cables to come
through before I can complete the build
though this is more of a test and it's
actually you're working really fun the
fans are really loud and I'm getting
over 1400 souls per second and I've got
the power and it's a 90 percent each and
these overclocks dialed and because each
of them need to be overclock separately
so that is the first one complete we're
going to get onto the second one now so
there is one slight hiccup here and this
is on the power supply that I bought I
bought a 1500 watt power supply and you
can see here it needs three-phase power
so this house I mean only has one place
power so unfortunately I'm going to have
to set up one of these rigs at my
friend's house the one that uses the
more powerful components
so that stage one of this build is
complete and it's still very messy but I
still have to wait on a few more parts
to come in and then I'll be able to
fully complete this and tell you guys
how much it is actually making at
today's rates and today's difficulty and
on that note unfortunately I'm not
currently mining the e and I'm not
jumping on the D I'm actually jumping on
the Z I'm using a currency called Z cash
and that's got its own little wallet
called Z cash for wind so all you have
to do to mine these cryptocurrencies is
essentially download a wallet and then
make your own little address and that
will have a private key attached to that
to which you can save onto a USB device
and so you won't lose your wallet and
you've heard of all those horror stories
where in the past people have lost their
Bitcoin wallets with like 5,000 coins or
something that's because they lost that
USB stick on it with the address and the
key though not to get too far off topic
after you've downloaded your wallet and
then you've set it all up you can then
choose the miner to download in my case
I'm using a miner called II W BSD cache
minor version 0.34 B so I've got that
set up and that's made specifically for
NVIDIA GPUs and they mined really well
on this platform I think I mean I'm
getting like 700 solutions per second or
something or I'm mining actually
harvesting 700 souls there are 700 Souls
coming in and I'm just harvesting them
every second victory the only way poor
jokes aside this is where things can get
a little bit tricky because here you
have to join a pool and if you don't
want to join a pool you're essentially
just playing your luck and something
like joining the lottery you could get
lucky and win a whole block of coins
say for instance 10 Zac coins or you
could miss out for months and get
nothing at all so with me I'm just
joining a pool it's called supernova and
then you have to go into the text file
and edit your details in so I've went to
the supernova website registered an
account and then made a worker and then
I put those details into that batch file
opened it up and then my GPUs will now
get stressed and then I'll mine on that
pool and get a delivered to my
wallet
and then I've got essentially Z cash in
my wallet now though all that aside
there are a lot of people who are
pissed off with crypto currencies a lot
of you guys out there in the audience
like damn people are driving up the
prices of GPUs and people are saying hey
this is just the waste of power in ways
I mean I can't really argue with you
guys I mean because that's what's
happening there is a lot of power being
wasted and GPU prices are going up it's
just in my case I'm thinking of it as
hey here's a slice of the pie with
cryptocurrency so there's a slice of the
pie and you can take a slice how small
it is but at the end of the day you can
take a slice or you can end up starving
so I'm just putting my samples to use
and I'd rather kind of not end up
starving also sorry I haven't made a
video for a while I've been quite sick I
got a virus and that took me out for
quite a few days however there is some
good news and that is that this month
use five blog will be coming from Japan
so stay tuned for that and and don't
forget to use your graphics cards to
mine GPU anyway guys if you enjoy
today's video then be sure to hit that
like button and let me know in the
comments section below do you want a
slice of the pie if so why and if not
why not love reading your comments as
always and I'll catch you in the next
tag video very soon
peace out for now bye
Oh hae young
yeah good mate hell yeah not too bad
yourself
yeah gone all right I mean I could be
doing better if I had a say for instance
some of those GPUs you got sitting there
on the backdrop you need a GPU yeah
actually more like 508 1080 is 1080p
I've sure what do you want those for I
just you know a little bit of
benchmarking okay no worries I said
thanks mate
say uh</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
