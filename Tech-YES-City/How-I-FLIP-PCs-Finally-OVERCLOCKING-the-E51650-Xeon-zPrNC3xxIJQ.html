e5 1650 Xeon and also showing y'all the
flip side of PC gaming how was that pun
welcome back to tokyo city guys is brian
coming back to you guys there with a
vlog of just things that i got to get
done around the house here and one of
those things is also selling the
accumulating rigs that are getting
accumulated over here over the last few
weeks and months and now this is kind of
sad because i've recorded this footage a
couple of weeks ago where i changed all
this hardware over here and put it into
this case that I got here for $20 now
I'm cuz I'm going to sell this
presentation is kind of an important
thing but with this if I was using this
for personal use you know price
performance all the way I wouldn't kept
this hideous looking case here but what
we did with this computer we fix this
heat sink than unzip tied-down before by
just getting this old intel heatsink and
pulling toward the clips off and then
putting it on there so this pc is now
working perfectly good it's all cleaned
up and it's gonna get sold i'm gonna try
and make a little bit of money on that
but let's get on to the other rigs and
then we'll talk about them all in total
so now we're just going to quickly clean
up the giveaway pc and like i'm going to
uninstall the games that I use for
benchmarking and stuff and know whoever
wins this PC I do not want you to ask me
for my Steam account username and
password like I think that's a
commandment of PC gaming one does not
ask another man for his username and
password it just doesn't happen don't go
there
but after we're done cleaning this up
we'll be putting that next to the Dark
Souls 3 PC over there and then we'll be
getting on to the water cooling PC
alright so next up here we've got the
giveaway sorry not to giveaway PC we've
got the water cooling experiment PC that
I paid once around two hundred twenty
dollars so all up this is this shows me
about two hundred twenty us so if I can
get my money back on this PC then I'll
be really happy even if I could just
break even on this one because it was
yet again a lot of experiments we came
into a few bit of different problems
notably being the ddr2 memory and also
the water cooling loop just didn't
really add any value on to this build so
we're kind of like already like 60 70
dollars behind there on this bill to
begin with I mean that memory was
overpriced too so it's actually probably
more than 70 dollars I'd say around
about eighty dollars behind so
so here's the three rigs lined up here
the ideology behind this is that I want
to make profit on this one so I built
this for around it at 200 but I did swap
the case over so it's around about 220
now and hopefully I can get around about
350 for it so that would be a good build
to make a little bit of profit on this
is a giveaway PC and man whoever wins
this is going to absolutely love this
thing
1080p gaming it doesn't really get much
better than this it is a beast even if
you're going to be streaming or whatnot
this thing will still perform really
well this year I just hope to break even
like I said before but without all being
said let's get on now to a big project
people have been wanting me to test so
I'm going to be doing the preliminary
figures on the e5 a 1650 Xeon here this
is the six core 12 threaded
overclockable Xeon on Sandy Bridge a lot
of people have been like dude you got to
overclock this thing so we're going to
get onto that now and go upstairs and
see what we can do with this thing so
here's the setup what we're going to be
using today we're going to be using this
850 watt Oram Pro gold rated power
supply the gigabyte x79 ud7 2 terabyte
hard drive and a 250 gig SSD there and
also the gtx 780 and for the cooling
when you use the mill storm 240
all-in-one water cooler so we see if we
can go and try and get a 5 gigahertz
that's what I'm actually going to try
and get on this CPU over 6 cores it's a
lot to ask but since it is the Xeon it
hopefully can do it so let's find out
so we're just about to hook all this up
and this power supply here does not have
solder connectors on its so I am going
to go downstairs and hack up this 24 pin
to leech off the 5 volt at the 3.34 the
solder connector there so let's go get
that done so we've got this power supply
here and now doesn't have any of those
proprietary connectors and now a quick
and easy way around this and I'm going
to say straight away this is certainly
not the best method is to grab your 24
pin there and just splice the solder
connector you have lying around see I
pulled this off a dead power splice so
I'm going to splice this into here and
then we're going to have a fully
functional power supply and we did pick
this up for around about $50 thing this
850 watt gold rated power supply
you
okay so we finished the soldering job
here and I had a lot of problems Sol
during this time for some reason that
just the solder was not sticking to the
iron and I guess that's just what
happens when you got a cheap solder
again that gets dirty I don't know but
anyway it's finished we're going to tape
it off now and then we're going to start
using this power supply
so that we have it guys this is now one
brand new power supply and look at that
it's all good to go
right so let's see if this thing boots
up for the first go and Dan I don't know
if you guys heard that but there was
like some kind of hopefully it's alright
so got the monitors here there and
ruffled up a bit maybe after a few
earthquakes who knows
oh cool all right so we have a signal
coming out of this thing looks like
Windows is loading up now and that's
really good news because we can get into
overclocking this thing so we're in the
bass now and this is the gigabyte of
UEFI dual BIOS for the x79 ud7 now we're
just going to fill around with some
settings so we can have this the phase
control on extreme performance I guess
that will just use all the phases or
it'll switch them faster there's not
enough there's no elaboration on the
setting there so we have the voltage
response there we want that to be fast
and we want a you know vrm they're
responding fast to our CPUs needs so we
want that on fast the load line
calibration we would want this on
extreme so whatever voltage we set for
our CPU we want that to be pretty much
the same when it's under stress or when
the city is being stress tested and what
this means is I want to get that V group
there and generally you don't have to
worry about this setting when you are
overclocking nowadays especially if
you've got a good power supply you mean
you in the old days used to have that B
droop mainly there because the power
supplies were bad and if you CPU dropped
and you didn't have a lower value it
would just spike too hard it could cause
damage to your hardware but nowadays
with the motherboards and the power
supplies being really good you can
generally set this pretty high without
having to worry too much so we put that
on extreme the other settings there they
aren't too important to overclocking the
actual CPU itself a CPU VGT load line
calibration I'm going to drop that up to
80% there again pretty aggressive
should make too much of a difference so
those are settings that were mainly
concerned about in here as well as the
PWM switch right because we're not going
for an extremely high overclock here we
can have our CPU phases they're
switching as low as possible it means
it's going to stay on the same phase as
much as possible before it switches over
I believe again there's not much detail
on the actual settings of cells I'm just
assuming a lot here but when we go to
the CPU core voltage here we can have at
at one point three five volt that should
be good I'm going to try and boot that
up at maybe four point six gigahertz
initially and then we'll go from there I
mean CPU PLL we should be able to get
away with having that at one point eight
four maybe sauce I mean we're gonna play
around with a few settings here I don't
really know what's going to come out of
this but we'll give this a shot first
and see how it goes the DRAM we're not
going to overclock the memory just yet
all we're not going to essentially put
platform chips out hope we don't have to
worry about those sitting at this moment
so let's give this a go we're going to
lock into the CPU of 4.6 now at those
settings and see if it boots up and now
I'm going to take a little bit slower
than normal because there is a setting
in this BIOS where you have to change
the PCIe to legacy for the Nvidia
graphics card now if I brick and I have
to reset my BIOS
it won't boot up with the Nvidia cards I
have to put in at night an old-school
AMD card or something and change that
setting and then reset so it'll be very
tedious but uh let's get on with this
all right so that just did not work at
all we're going to have to maybe up the
voltage a little bit there formed in
Buddha 4.6 gigahertz so we're going to
try some different settings there to see
if we can get a better boot damnit it's
like a boot back into the BIOS
thankfully I just don't know why it
didn't even attempt to boot so it will
just drop that down to 4.4 now and just
see if that works and if that works then
it's just probably not the best Zeon now
you never know and see that's the thing
when you buy you CPUs off eBay it could
have been one really good overclock up
selling off all these duds like maybe
the guy bought ten CPUs he picked out
the best one sold the rest sold the
other nine so I know that happens in the
overclocking community so just depends
maybe
yeah so we're booting up a 4.4 so we're
going to keep testing the CPU to see
what we can really get out of it here so
yeah we're looking for like a boot
that's relatively stable at a pretty
high clock speed so let's give it a go
all right so back in the BIOS here let's
get back into our overclock alright you
know what we're just gonna do we're just
gonna have four point eight and we are
going to up that voltage up to around
about one point three nine and then
we're probably going to take off that
low noise add app door and let those
fans just go hand so I mean that's what
I'm kind of feeling like at the moment
give that a go just a fast-track this
overclocking experience let's give that
a shot
okay 4.8 is at least doing nothing but--
fire oh okay
so I don't think this CPU is as good as
other people are posting up or I've seen
screenshots of I mean I didn't see a guy
have a screenshot of 5 gigahertz at like
one point 4 volts so I was pretty jelly
when I saw that but let's try I mean
let's try four point seven maybe four
point seven might be good enough you
never know unless you go so let's give
this a workout four point seven one
point three nine five watt to be honest
though I wouldn't want to take it any
higher than this because you know it's
24/7 usage so the CPU isn't as good as
what I hoped it would be but if we can
get like four point seven or even four
point six out of it at one point three
nine volt I'll be pretty happy with that
so we could see if it fails the
overclock then 4.7 looks like it's my
reach window so this is a good good sign
although I do expect it to be unstable
no there we go okay sweet so we put it
up at four point seven
let's change over to the thunderous fan
noise no okay okay that wasn't meant to
be so easy there just crashed okay so in
other words the overclock at four point
seven is not working unless we might
give it a little bit more voltage I'm
not too keen to take it over one point
four really because again I'm looking
for a 24-7 stable here
yeah that's pretty high
okay we'll give that a going into one
point 4 0 5 volts at four point seven K
goes let's give this thing a workout and
I mean if it if it stays stable like if
it gets the windows and it sort of sits
there then I can start toggling and
playing around with it if it doesn't
then I'm gonna have to drop it back to
four point six because that's probably
about where it will be the highest
twenty-four seven over five to the CPU
keep in mind I've got that low noise
adapter on and the radiator is getting a
little bit warm so once I take it off
and it goes here we'll see what we can
do okay so we've got this thing stable
at 4.5 gigahertz now in the max
temperature of 67 there so we will try
and up it to four point six stable and
possibly even four point seven so let's
get into that now crash incoming crash
so then we have it we've got the silicon
lottery and then we've got the eBay
silicon lottery now the ladder you will
almost guaranteed to lose out as you saw
in my case I could only get this thing
to four point five gigahertz and oh you
probably sitting there like four point
five s not too bad yeah I know it's not
that bad but we had a C to revision Xeon
e5 1650 which is kind of like the best
of the best when it comes to this six
core on that X 79
motherboard there so and I also did try
everything I know there's going to be
people out there like man you did you
try matching the IMC to the cpu vtt did
that didn't make a difference try it up
on that to 1.2 volt couldn't get this
thing stable of 4.6 try to open the
voltage even delay 1.4 3 volt and I mean
even at that stage I'm not willing to go
that higher that much higher because a I
want this thing for a 24-7 stable and be
yeah I don't want to destroy my CPU but
also will say that the motherboard in
general was pretty bad this time around
that 3d bios was I mean what the hell
was going on there also with the PWM
control that was just terrible as well
if I left that on in the BIOS my fan
speeds would literally just go up and
down up and down I could literally
change for almost every degree and
change on the CPU and I actually had the
app Bill Powell on there when I was
clocking the 3930k with that setting and
the hack Bell gave out it like it just
cut out and stopped working so I had to
turn that setting off that was a bad
setting there and also in general there
was a lot of other settings that I did
try like disabling all the speedstep
technology disabling the turbo the C
States yes so I just could not get this
thing to run stable at 4.6 gigahertz now
it could have been the motherboard but
I'm pretty sure that we just locked out
I mean we didn't lock out on the CPU so
that's that sometimes you win sometimes
you lose
looks like we're on a bit of a losing
streak lately two rotten tomato with
that memory now the CPU and you know I
was hyping this CPU up for like weeks
I've been like man I got this Xeon in at
the e5 1650 and it was a complete fail
that's about it for me today I did do my
best and I just couldn't get it any
higher the thermals were great and 4.5
gigahertz is still a pretty good
damn overclock there but I will be
coming back with an X 58 overclocking
tutorial and a LGA 771 overall you're on
a live stream so we're going to do that
live for you guys in the next couple of
weeks I just got to get this build out
of the way with and I'm going to
or during a CUDA sake you to go case for
it you know that character from Bleach
even though it's not the name of the
case that's what I thought it was
initially so I'm going to order one or
more of those cases in that's the same
case that I'm using for the giveaway now
I'm going to put all that hardware that
you saw today in that case make a build
bench market in games see how it runs
and then sell it anyway guys hope you
enjoyed this video if you did please
give a big thumbs up if you have any
questions or comments be sure to drop a
comment the conversation below and I'll
catch you in the next Tech video very
soon
peace out for now bye so with the eBay
silicon lottery I wonder if there is the
PayPal counter silicon lottery you just
put in a PayPal dispute this this thing
didn't know four o'clock high enough
that would make you the world's biggest
douchebag and I am the world's biggest
douchebag so why not kidding kidding
kidding but I did open a dispute for
that ddr2 memory that crap was just
insane I had to check our cities and
Brian come and take it about making an
emo PC bill I don't know how this is
going to go down but I want to make an
emo PC build so if you have any
suggestions on how to do that
comments brothers now I know what you're
thinking I want to see the flip so I'm
gonna show you what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna get the camera over here bring
that over with the lighting we're going
to bring that over get all this ready
all right so I'm just going to take a
photo of this PC now just get one of
those juicy shots that we need and
probably get one more and then we will
flip the PC
Preston is one computer done let's get
on to the next one
you
so now we've got these two pcs photoed
we're going to upload them to a website
called yahoo auctions because I'm in
Japan I want to sell these locally
because the shipping is really cheap
domestically so let's upload these
things and ask what we can for them I
guess
okay so in Japan this is a very popular
benchmark this is the heavens ward final
fantasy 14 I think so a lot of people
when they sell pcs they run this
benchmark so I'm going to be running
this benchmark and then selling this PC
so let's get this finished and then
we're good to go
with the flip side the flip flip side
the lipid loop side
flip flip flip side
live with with live beside</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
