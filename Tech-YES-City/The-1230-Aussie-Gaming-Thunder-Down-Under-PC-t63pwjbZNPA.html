up oh yeah a 1230 dollar gaming pc for
the awesome Ozzy's down under
welcome back to take a city this is
brownies you coming back to you guys in
Australia with a PC pop picker to twelve
hundred and thirty dollar budget build 4
jun 2014 now tell me if it what do you
guys think we've been going with you
might for so many months now let me know
your thing with pc papa anyway this
month we have a basically just a huge
build i mean for 1230 dollars it is damn
quick it's going to play all the latest
games at ample fine this is the first
part of the build of the intel i5
Haswell refreshed now don't be alarmed
it is the best value added out there at
the moment in australia mean we get
ripped off on everything but i guess if
you had to pick the best rip off this
cpu is it so you got four cores clocked
at three point two gigs and that also
when we go with this cpu we save fifty
dollars because we don't need to get a
case EP but also we save money because
we don't need to get a cpu cooler and we
don't need to get a motherboard so I
like a z97 motherboard so we're
literally saving I think it's like
almost two hundred dollars i mean
overclocking damn like costs 200 bucks
overclocker cpu nowadays that's the
premium your pan back in the day it used
to cost nothing so goddamn intel and
trying and trying to take it to the bank
but I say don't let them so anyway
there's motherboards find some micro ATX
it's got the bottom chopped off it's got
one graphics pci express to i believe
for the gtx 780 which will be ample fine
you've got two slots of memory they're
fake you bytes of ram got the cpu slot
there you've got your onboard audio as
well and that's yeah for gaming get your
NRC what more do you need so $62 if you
want to spend a bit of extra money and
go with the h87 performance from asrock
that's packed with features as well you
got a better on-board audio solution
better and i see better this better that
but it's your call this thing would be
ample fine for this budget anyway let's
get on the next bottle to build the
g.skill sniper so we're getting two
sticks of four gigabytes this stuff also
looks good but it's also pretty much
priced around about where memory is
priced in oz at the moment I'm its
ninety-eight dollars for two sticks it's
ridiculously expensive I mean you can
probably find it for $90 but this stuff
honestly it's tight timings your cl9
memory
at 1.5 volts you just whack in those XMP
profiles and Haswell will love this
stuff if you can find ya again if you
can find that a memory for a better
price than by all means do it but this
stuff looks pretty tight it looks pretty
decent so I would go with this next part
of the build is the ssdnow v300 242 I
ssdnow SSDs are not just cheap in the
states in the UK they're pretty cheap in
Australia as well 145 dollars is pretty
damn good value for a 240gb SSD i paid
like 180 for mine in japan so that was a
few months ago so they have it bang this
is not good like get an SSD this month
like its edge cheap man you'll be like
you and ball and rolling baby with a
torn 40 gb SSD you'll be just smoking
man your friend alas chelate look I've
got a 12 hundred dollar AMD PC or a
twelve hundred dollar dell intel dell pc
that I bought and he's like he's trying
to push this piece ceiling on you and
you're like nah man I went to tech a
city got the best PC 1222 old pc it
comes with an SSD gtx 780 and you're
just going to literally romp his pc if
you do benchmarks side by side and he's
gonna be like oh my god never take this
deal back but $1,500 del sack of
and that's that so yeah anyway that's
the value you get out of these pcs
anyway next by the build gtx 780
windfalls edition now this thing for
five hundred sixty dollars I was like
damn okay put in a gtx 770 that was like
four hundred dollars that was the r9
290x i was like three hundred ninety
eighty dollars i was like damn man you
just go for a gtx 780 for five hundred
sixty dollars be done with it this thing
is huge I've got one in my rig at the
moment man they smoke games but if you
go with this pc literally you're going
to need at least a 1440p $300 ebay
special or 120 hertz monitor to take
advantage of this thing because it is a
beast of a graphics card the sweet spot
for these graphics cards though i
believe are the 1440p monitors they're
really good good value for money there
too I've got one at the moment the
Korean specials the IPS monitors they
are beautiful anyway next part of built
so this is the k2 80 ATX mid tower
case from coolermaster as you guys can
see there's pretty much no photos on PC
part picker but it's $52 and here we go
some dudes actually put a build log here
which is actually really cool this case
is pretty much featured here so I'll
just pull up a picture we can see here
so yeah it'll have room for those extra
long graphics cards there you've got
enough bees there for a DVD Drive and a
hard drive in an SSD and you got to cut
out there at the bottom for the power
supply so it looks pretty good to go
here it is here's a better case like
this is a full-size ATX board you've got
a lot of extra room there for the
graphics card the wind for sedition
match Lee may not fit the wind for
sedition is a very very long graphics
card so I actually got to be careful
with that I mean if you don't mind just
getting out of pair of pliers and just
ripping out this pit here if your
graphics card doesn't fit that'll be
fine as well that's what I'd do right
save some money get oh look at this man
look at these headphones I ripped these
two pieces these are the ghetto houses
and man they sound freaking amazing
right Do It Yourself baby for the win oh
yeah so anyway if you're worried about
it though if you're really worried about
it go by like a seventy dollar case with
a super extra long freaking cut out for
the graphics card but yeah one of these
things I would make it fit anyway so
next by the build is the animax 650 watt
bronze certified semi modular like look
at all this marketing going on in the
title here but anyway it's not just
marketing though it actually as useful
semi modular means that the essential
cables are going to be hard wired but
then the plugs that you generally like
extra SATA cables and stuff you are able
to detach so I actually really like semi
modular like you can see here so you
should just get away with using the main
power point here but 651 as well like
it's bronze rated it looks like it's
good to go it'll be ample fine for the
gtx 780 and the non overclocked I five
so literally you probably be pulling
about 350 watts from the wall the beam
bronze rated it looks pretty I'm is $75
damn and it's pretty good way for money
not so I'd be going with this cpu I mean
this power supply sorry it looks good on
a semi modular bronze 75 bucks he's not
referred to what year what more could
you ask for so anyway Next life by the
build is a DVD burner if you have one of
these
things save yourself 23 bucks if you
don't have one then you're generally
going to need one around the house so
get one for the ice installs from DVDs
or backing up yeah is knit on the dvds
and that leaves the whole total to
twelve hundred and twenty three dollars
aud that's inclusive I think GST
inclusive as well so yeah and as always
you can go to msy you might find the
best prices again get the best price
baby but this build is hot man its work
its frickin sizzlin so if your latest
bill please give it a thumbs up if you
haven't raised to hit that sub button
yeah whoa I'm feeling it like today I'm
feeling it yeah and I'll just roll the
intro and catch you guys with another
tech video soon peace out for now bye oh
yeah and tell that friend if he's got a
dell sack of just tell him look man
get on my level
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
