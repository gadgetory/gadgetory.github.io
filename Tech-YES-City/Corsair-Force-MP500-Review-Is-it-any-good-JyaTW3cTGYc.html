up to nvm in Lhasa with their latest
offering be the np-500 though one
question remains is it any good let's
find out and welcome back to tech city
this is Brian coming to you guys today
with the review of course there's latest
entry in the MDOT to market this is the
fourth MP 500 series it comes in three
different flavors the 120 240 and 480
gigabyte versions so today I'm testing
the 480 gigabyte version which was
provided to me as a review sample from
course set and this drive itself also
runs off your PCIe bus rather than your
typical ciders 3 and this enables the
drive to perform much faster than a SATA
3 Drive and getting straight into the
results here this Drive performs very
well with rice going well over a
thousand megabytes per second and Reed's
hitting into the two thousand four
hundred megabytes per second mark
however this is a bit far off the
advertised three thousand megabytes per
second and two thousand four hundred
megabytes per second speed printed on
the box there looking deeper into the
consistency of the read and write
performance which is the benchmark that
I take very seriously as you can have on
drives that can perform really well on
paper but in the real world if it
doesn't have consistent read and writes
and it could let you down when you need
it most and I was glad to report that
the Corsair drive had really consistent
reads and writes that didn't get far off
the average speeds of reported in a SSD
which means that if you need the MP 500
to perform strong and real-world tasks
then it surely will taking off the
branding reveals the hardware beneath on
this particular model the drive sports
for 120 gigabyte the Schieber mlc flash
banks so people looking for a drive with
better memory than TLC which is becoming
very common in standard set of three
drives will be pleased does mlc type
memory is generally more durable and
faster than teal see also the controller
on this drive is B 5 and PS 5000 7-7 and
the burst Bank features 512 megabytes of
ddr3 nano memory which acts as a buffer
to provide the consistencies that we saw
before the drive also comes with
included support for course there's
software toolbox which is a simple tool
that allows you to do some cool things
like clone your drive trim or even
secure
rade if the said course edge right
supports such features but what about
other drugs out there well comparing it
to the z/28 EMV mmm - I have here from a
pacer it is great to see that the
Corsair drive was edging this thing out
in performance and also the np-500 here
features a three year warranty further
on this particular model it has a 700
terabyte written insurance rating so it
should last a long time
though the price of the a piece is v to
80 however isn't there $100 cheaper with
the Corsair coming in around about 325
us for the 480 you buy model and around
about 520 AUD for people in Australia
the 240 light comes in at roughly 190 us
and the 120 gigabyte model at 110 so if
you do get the smaller variants other
240 of the 120 just keep in mind as the
performance could be inferior to the
results that I'm posting here today so
its conclusion time and at this price
who needs this drive well in a recent
video I did I featured a hard disk drive
versus the sadhas 3 SSD this is an nvme
MDOT - and there are certainly
differences and ultimately each product
works well for different markets this in
my opinion is a drive to someone who
needs either the massive speed games
over the side of three drives which
definitely do benefit individuals in
productivity and also give slightly
better load times and of course lastly
there is another market out there now
that some people who just want the
absolute best not just in speeds but
also the small form factor and further
people who have a need for having no
power or data cables at all in their
build and since it is all black it will
slot nicely cosmetically speaking into a
lot of bills so again I will reiterate
this product is not a bang for buck SSD
and there is another Drive out there
from Samsung the 960 pro which is also
an m2 though I haven't taken a look at
this drive I have heard it's very fast
and also it costs around the same though
I can't speak for the consistency of the
read and writes as it does use a
different controller to the np-500 which
I've featured here today so overall the
NB 500 is a very solid product that not
only performs really well in terms of
speed but is also very consistent on the
reading right so anyway guys I hope you
enjoyed this review if you did - be sure
to hit that like button and let me know
in the comments section below what do
you guys think of the np-500 series
have you yet to enter the MV mm to
market and if so what drive would you
get the loved in your comments is always
and I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
