make when you pick up an RX 574 25
Aussie dollars or in the US about 17 and
a half USD making this easily one of the
best deals I've got in the history of
the channel now actually did get quite a
few of these as well as this one right
beside of the RX 470 which these were
guaranteed working so there was a catch
to getting these nitros or I think that
the polls or something like that and
that was that they're all untested and I
didn't know if they worked though they
said they'll working on the mining bench
okay and so if that was good enough for
the mining bench then they should be
good enough for gaming after some tech
yes loving but I got the right here the
RX 4 70s I got these 460 Aussie dollars
a pop and it got me thinking so that's
about 42 USD as well it got me thinking
with this right we've got the RX 470
where the RX 570 so I've got the two of
these right together but what if you're
in the flipping gaming PC's and also is
it better say for longevity purposes to
perhaps even load an Rx for seven TV
BIOS on to an RX 570 and that's
something I wanted to check because from
the top of my memory I believe that
these only lost about 10% performance to
the RX 5 70s but at the same time the RX
5 seventies ended up using about 40%
more power than the arch 4 70s did so
that power efficiency is way in favor of
the RX 4 70s and of course if you're
putting together gaming pcs that means
less heat in the case means you can get
away with a more budget orientated power
supply and not have to worry about
potential problems in the future
also on that note these only need a 6
pin these also only need a 6 pin but
even though they've got an 8 pin you can
sort of get away with Polaris by just
using a 6 pin it was a weird sort of
thing that I found out years ago and
it's sort of stuck with these rx5 70s
ever since but with that aside I'm going
to get both the V boss is updated from
the mining versions to the gaming
versions I'm going to do a quick check
before I apply some new thermal paste to
check out the temperatures of both these
cards give them some tech yes loving and
then recheck the temperatures as well as
after that loading up on our x4 70 BIOS
on this sapphire our x5 70
then after that checking the power
consumption and the performance because
these right here the RX five 70s and the
RX 4 seventies have a direct power meter
where you can measure how much power the
actual card is using regardless of what
else is on the system so it's actually a
handy feature of Polaris without aside
let's just get this show on the road
I give and you take it away
it's clear that your fare and Sonia
so both these cards have now had some
tech yes loving applied to both the rx
570 this one here took a lot longer than
usual underneath the fans there's sort
of like some weird corrosion thing going
on I guess that just happens when
they've been mined on a little bit too
long and I have seen this in the past
with some other night rows that have
come through here so maybe it's just a
unique thing to these cards but I'm not
too sure did take a long time to get off
and so I had to give that a lot of extra
tech yes loving and now it's looking
pretty good
hopefully the temperatures the before on
this one was 66 degrees and the before
on this one was 81 degrees so we're
gonna put both of these on the test
bench now see they often temperatures
and then also load up an rx 470 bios on
this to check out the performance
differences and we'll just test across
three titles because they are pretty
much the exact same cards but once got a
refresh bios and of course it's had time
to mature a little bit more so
technically it should be a little bit
better but we'll find out how much
better the rx 570 is right now
so the temperature differences between
these two Cod's was pretty interesting
the Nitro only dropped down one degree
and then the RX 470 the reference model
here this dropped down six degrees so
this got a bigger difference than the
570 and the FPS was actually pretty
negligible I mean in Tomb Raider there
was only a 2 FPS difference and then in
Tom Clancy's the division to a 1 FPS
difference and then in Far Cry New Dawn
we got a 2 FPS difference but as we
looked at before with the power
consumption we had around 90 watts
versus 120 watts so it looks like the RX
474 what it's worth is doing a better
job in terms of efficiency but we're
gonna try out one thing now and that is
to put an Rx for 70 BIOS on the RX 570
and see what we can come up with and see
how it performs
so now trying to flash an RX 470 by us
on to an RX 570 I know it seems a little
bit bizarre made things even more
bizarre when we successfully did flash
the 470 nitro bias under the 570 nitro
but then it was still coming up in
Windows as an rx 570 and in fact the
power consumption was like 6 Watts more
than it originally was on the 570 so
that was that just left me scratching my
head maybe perhaps sapphire were using a
more leaky GPU die on the nitro series
which then overclocks higher generally
but then for the RX 470 reference design
they're using essentially the models
that don't leak as much so they're more
efficient up to a certain point and they
don't overclock as well why is where
things get even more crazy because we
ended up getting the original rx 470 the
BIOS from this reference model and it
successfully flashed over to the 517
Nitro and this is where things got
really really weird because it ended up
showing up in Windows again as an RX 570
but the power consumption dropped down
to around 85 watts so we saw like a 35
what
drop in the power consumption but this
time around the FPS was considerably
lower than the 570 nitro original v bios
in fact we were a lot lower than the
iris 470 as well so important rater we
had 51 average FPS 30 low and then
pulling up Tom Clancy's the division 2
we saw a big drop down to 51 average FPS
and then far cry new dawn that dropped
down to 62 FPS so very weird results to
the point where I guess out of these
three sort of biases that I've used here
today the RX 470 this original one does
come out on top so basically if you are
into maybe flippin pcs or you want to
use your cards for a very long time then
essentially the less wattage that part
you
is the longer it's going to lost all
other things considered so there's gonna
be less heat dumped in the case it's
gonna be less heat being pushed out
through all the components etc so but
another thing worth mentioning as well
as that trying to load up a custom BIOS
now on AMD graphics cards like these the
polaris cards are x4 70s and 570s
doesn't work anymore at least from the
top of my memory because as soon as you
mod that v bios
it then loses its signature and
basically what you'll get is those error
messages when you try to install the
drivers or play games so you have to use
the official v bios but within that v
Bioscope you've only got a limited
selection where you have to use for
instance this bios on the RX 517 nitro
and unfortunately just didn't really
work out in this case where it was
giving a lot law before that law wattage
requirement so basically to summarize
today's video when it comes to getting a
GPUs with mining v biases on them and
you're going to reflash them just stick
to the original v bios and if you're
going to have to tune it you might want
to use maybe Whatman or msi afterburner
with these cards and tinker around with
a software mod because at least that way
your games are going to work things are
gonna work properly as opposed to
loading up a different v by us which in
this case this RX 470 was more efficient
it wasn't when we loaded it up on to the
nitro it just gave out a lot less
performance than one would otherwise be
used to and obviously I don't want to
put that in a piece in and try and reef
lip that it's just not good for the
end-user to be getting a lot lower
performance and also coming out of
today's video the RX 470 did perform
very well perform better in my opinion
especially in terms of efficiency than
the rx 570 so that was awesome to see
but it does still leave the question
open of was perhaps the RX 470 a better
bin in terms of the GPU die than the rx
570 was was maybe the RX 570 the worst
of the worst when it came to bending
polaris cards that i'm not sure of if
you guys out there know the answers be
sure to drop a comment in the comment
section below and also let us know what
you think of the RX 470 versus the 570
which one would you pick over the other
and wide love reading your thoughts and
opinions
and if you enjoyed today's video then be
sure to hit that like button and I will
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
