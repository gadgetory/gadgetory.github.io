second-generation CPUs are almost here
and today we're allowed to unbox them
and show you guys what's inside the
boxes here also talk about some of the
upcoming specs with these motherboards
and CPUs so you know I'm straight into
the juicy details for you guys so people
are labeling this a refresh it's
actually on a new lithography so it's 12
nanometer instead of the previous 14
nanometer that they used so it will be
more power efficient just by that spec
alone of course the IPC and all the
figures will show you on the 19th
however the SKUs available are the 2700
X coming in at three hundred and
twenty-nine dollars this includes the
raised prism LED cooler and it's only
$30 more expensive than the horizon 7
2700 it does include a higher base clock
3.7 gigahertz versus 3.2 now the 2700
you only get the raised spire cooler so
that $30 alone I would justify that
easily getting that better cooler
because if it's anything to go by with
the 1800 X that cooler individually on
the markets sold for easily $60 and plus
sometimes going up anywhere near $100
that's how desirable it was so getting
one of these coolers in the box and then
just selling it individually would be a
smart move or using it in another build
if you're using say a six core 12 thread
for a friend and you want to use a
really good cooler because I have tested
this cooler and it does go pretty hard
that is a good thing with the 2700 X so
this time around I think it's a
different story
going with that higher end skew because
you do get in my opinion more value than
the 2700 s offering just from the box
specs alone so when we look down the
other skis there are the six core 12
threads that are coming as well 2600 X
you'll get a race fire cooler 95 watt
TDP cooler then you go the 2600 which
will close the race stealth cooler so
that's only a 65 watt TDP cooler the
base clocks on them is three points four
gigahertz and 3.6 gigahertz respectively
so this is before you even overclock
them so after you overclock them you can
off-course overclock any of these SKUs
on Abbey 350 and X 370 or X 470 now the
motherboards here with
got X 470 motherboards being released on
launch with these risin products so
after going to Thailand and talking to
all the AMD reps that's why I was
actually there was for the launch event
I spoke around with the differences
between the X 370 X 470 and at the base
level there is really no core
differences between the feature set
except for AMD sin semi technology which
is AMD sort of faster device use it as
temporary storage solution and you get
that for free with an X 470 and it will
make for instance if you've got a 2
terabyte hard drive you can add on an
nvme drive a 256 gigabyte nvme drive for
example now you've got 2.2 terabytes
but it'll also use that nvme for the
most files used so it does promise
faster speeds and of course you can have
that all in one drive so there's no
hassles about switching between drives
or loading data up it'll do it all for
you you can get this on other
motherboards the x3 70s for example that
will come in with a cost of $20 for the
license however that is included with
the x4 70 now also with the x4 70
motherboards they will feature of course
aesthetic differences between the x-ray
70 line you also will get in general a
lot of people are saying that the biases
are more easy to use we'll be testing
that out in a motherboard comparison but
one thing to go by is the V RMS already
on some of those X 370 boards we're
already pretty beefy so if you've got an
X 370 board already especially high-end
one the good news is is you can use it
with these new SKUs just as long as you
update the BIOS and get it ready and
supported with all those details aside
let's quickly take a look at these
products that are on the bench here to
give you guys an idea of what you could
expect if you do indeed one of preorder
these or get them day one
so first up here we have the x4 70
Taichi ultimate they're going with the
gunmetal look this time around previous
generation they went with the white and
black and this time it does have a
little bit of a beefier vrm I believe
you've also got an extra four pin CPU
connector as well as your RGB control
headers got two gold power and reset
buttons and also a 3.1 front out as well
so a little bit feature wise I guess the
3.1 front out header is an addition over
the previous generation of boards but
the socket of course is still the same
the layout in general is still very
similar to the x3 so many board so there
it is there look forward to testing that
tooth for you guys but next up here we
have the x4 70 from Oris this is the
gaming 7 and this as well also features
a very beefy vrm and you also again have
that four pin connector as well as the 8
pin connector similar scenario as well
got the 3.1 front out header too and
another thing I will note about this is
they're going back with that old-school
heatsink design for the vrm where you've
got the fins located on the heat sinks
themselves this really does in my
opinion help with heat dissipation from
soaking up the heat from the VRMs be
nice if they could include as well those
old-school 40 mil fans that they were
putting on the varium heat things I'd
love to see that come back they do make
a difference and of course people do
want their VRMs running lower especially
with a m4 since you can use this board
in the future for next generation rise
and CPUs so it does make the x4 70 a
very good purchase just like the x3 70
though of course going on with these CPU
coolers themselves this is the Wraith
prism RGB LED cooler so of course as you
guys know already that RGB will make
this cooler just that much better when
it comes to cooling down the CPU but it
does look pretty good I've seen this
thing in the flesh booting it up it does
look really cool it's also got two
control switches on it which will allow
to go full throttle if you want it to or
you can set it to PWM mode control so
very chunky cooler very nice and then of
course with the 2600 X you've got the
rave
spire here which is just your basic race
by you're probably already used to it if
you've unlocked the Rosen v 1600 for
example so not a whole Lots changed
there on the 2700 you do get the RGB LED
ring on this cooler and then of course
going down to 2600 you get the race
stealth now the last thing to talk about
with the risin plus second generation
chips is the memory so memory
manufacturers have booted up more
compatible modules for these
motherboards this time around so you
won't have as many problems overclocking
your memory as a lot of people did on
the X 370 especially around launch this
kit here is thirty four hundred
megahertz XMP so that's what you
guaranteed with these motherboards
though of course I looked forward to
overclocking it even higher as we know
Rison is very memory dependent it loves
those high memory speeds so this stuff
is definitely going to be certified if
AMD are sending it out with the
reviewers kits so I look forward to
testing this stuff it also does look
pretty cool with that camera on board
anyways last thing I want to know from
you is what tests do you want to see on
the launch date review let me know in
the description below because I'll be
putting this CPU especially the 2700 X
up against the 8700 K I'm sure a lot of
people want to see a big comparison and
showdown there but also this other
peculiar and very specific test you want
me to do then let me know in the comment
section below and also if you like this
video then be sure to hit that like
button and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
bye
so x4 70 is among us that's actually a
huge box it's massive so that's probably
better yeah this is the race spire and
also another thing i forgot to mention
is these will be soldered from the die
to the IIHS so you don't have to worry
about deleting or bad temperatures or
anything like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
