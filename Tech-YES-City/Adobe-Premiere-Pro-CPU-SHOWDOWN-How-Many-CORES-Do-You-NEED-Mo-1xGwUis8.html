now all this hardware you know what I'm
loving it
welcome back to tech yes city this is
brian coming to you guys today with a
cpu showdown in Premiere Pro now in the
next coming days I'm also going to be
doing a GPU showdown with OpenCL vs.
CUDA so stay tuned for that though let's
quickly get on to the contestants and
then the benchmarks first up here we
have the 6600 K this is the four core
consumer variant with only four threads
available I managed to get this thing up
to 4.6 gigahertz the next CPU we have up
here is the 3930k which is six core 12
threaded beasts this thing I got this to
4.4 swagga Hertz then next up here we
have my dual a 526 70s which combine to
make Captain Planet
I'm just kidding they actually make 16
calls 32 threads at 3 gigahertz and then
last up here we have the e 526 58 this
was an engineering sample I picked up
off eBay for $300 I got this thing to
2.6 key goods on all of those 12 cores
and 24 threads now looking at the
results here we can see that all these
CPUs pretty much scored in the same
league with no one having a massive
victory over the other it was actually
ironic that my 32 threads Joule Xeon CPU
scored the worst times when it came to
the GTX 970 having cooter enabled now
without cooter enabled the render times
literally went up to like 6 hours so you
will definitely want to have open seal
or cooter enabled if you're editing in a
4k video workspace now this time around
I did do a normal video that I would
edit for you guys in a 4k workspace to
an GTX 780 video which has adjustment
layers it's got colors and all that jazz
put in there and so will these
benchmarks will be indicative of someone
just getting camera footage off their
camera dropping it into Premiere Pro and
then also editing and adjusting the
layers and adding things in though I
will point out though I found when I was
using my four core especially when I had
the mp4 footage in that workflow area
there I found that it really was
struggling at certain intervals as
opposed to all the other CPUs that I
tested here they were all fine in the
workflow process so also the final
render times the four core was just
getting taxed completely to the max in
other words I couldn't do anything else
in that final render time as opposed to
my jewels eons where I'd be listening to
music talking on skype and also editing
a thumbnail out for the video that I'm
currently rendering also lastly I will
say Adobe you guys need to update your
website with some proper recommendations
on the specs I really couldn't find
anything other than just a dual core and
four gigabytes of memory for the
requirements you guys really should have
an optimization guy going on especially
for a service where people are paying
$50 a month and also I will say that I'm
sorry I made a mistake in my previous
showcase video where I actually hit the
match source button and that allowed my
results to be pretty much inaccurate so
I'm sorry about that however this time
around the results are really apples to
apples and if I do these benchmarks
again in the future I'm definitely going
to do it with a can
temporary workflows sort of project for
you guys to give you accurate results
anyway guys if you have any questions or
comments about this video be sure to
drop a comment the conversation below
and I'll get back to you as soon as I
can and I'll be getting on to some other
benchmarks really soon for you guys to
stay tuned for that and peace out for
now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
