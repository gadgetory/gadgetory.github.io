part two of the ultimate showdown
between the 7,700 cake lost at 5
gigahertz versus the horizon 7 1700
clocked at 4 gigahertz versus the joules
eons clocked at 3 gigahertz so the 16
calls 32 threads of that Sandy Bridge
architecture and how will it fare at 4k
resolution with a gtx 1080p eye let's
find out
log bag guys to part two of the ultimate
showdown between the i7 7700 K which is
clocked to 5 gigahertz and then we have
the r7 1700 clock to 4 gigahertz and
then on the right there we've got the
jewels eons in at 3 gigahertz on the
Sandy Bridge architecture there now I
have also posted on Twitter the jewels
eons with hyper-threading disabled and
all those games where the threads want
to being utilized are still utilizing 16
threads so what this essentially means
is that those games in the previous
benchmark video and in this benchmark
video that aren't utilizing all those 32
threads are indeed capped at 16 threads
utilization so this first benchmark here
doom
it looks like the jewels eons are
actually winning this benchmark
surprisingly it was really interesting
to see that they are pulling ahead here
even though the there is a bit of
variance in this but I did test the
exact same scene doing the exact same
things and one interesting thing that
came out of this was the r7 1700 for K
in Doom on Vulcan did have input lag
that was quite noticeable and this is
something that I didn't see at 720p so
that was really interesting observation
though with this first benchmark it
looks like the jewels did score one of
the only victories it did score in this
game in comparison so the next benchmark
we have up here is ashes of the
singularity and dx12 now some
interesting observations came out of
here first is the GPU utilization versus
the power target limit or the power
usage we can see that as jumping all
over the place sometimes even dipping is
high or going as high as a hundred and
twenty something percent you'll see that
throughout this benchmark though the
rising CPU did score a clear victory in
this benchmark over the 7700 K even
though it was just by a little bit it is
still a victory and I do like to report
on all the numbers throughout all these
benchmarks and of course the Jules Elms
interestingly enough this is the only
benchmark where having those sixteen
threads with hyper-threading enabled it
did score a victory over itself when I
did go back and retest this and the
sixteen called 16 threads actually lost
and all the other benchmarks did win but
in this one in particular it did lose so
the way that this benchmark is utilizing
the CPU is still very
interesting we can see here that the
rising CPU and the 7700 K even at 4k are
still being utilized near a hundred
percent that's because I put it on CPU
focused mode but the GPU utilization is
absolutely crazy in this game and I
think the rising CPU does do a better
job of utilizing that GTX 10 atti in
this benchmark and now I have sped this
up to 200% because I want to move on to
the next benchmark as this one is very
fast so it's actually very long and so I
fastened it up to give you guys the
results and we can see there the 1700
did score that pretty sweet victory
which was good to see but moving on into
the next game here I push this one up to
the front of the queue because it's
actually one of the surprisingly really
optimized titles for the PCL is actually
really shocked to see how well this
title is optimised on PC especially in
dx11 can see you there the dual
zealand's that's real all those threads
are being utilized and we saw at 720p
benchmark it actually scored close to
the Rison r7 1700 and then of course in
this benchmark we'll see that D 1700 and
the 7700 K score exactly the same frame
rate I was shocked
so in this benchmark exactly the same
frame rates across the 7700 K and the r7
1700 now one interesting thing at the
end of this benchmark is the CPU
utilization is 22% on the horizon and
it's a 33% I believe on the 7700 K so if
that's any indication of how much extra
Headroom the rising CPU has then maybe
an extra 50% but to keep in mind though
windows utilization of those CPU threads
is still something to be seen but it is
interesting when we do these benchmarks
we get to see extra insights to how they
really work and how things are I guess
the 4k benchmarks really were an
eye-opener I thought it would just be
boring and everything would be just
exactly the same across the board but
that looks not to be the case we can
also see what that GPU there the power
consumption is going pretty damn high
sometimes going over that cap of the
founders edition there of a hundred and
twenty
five percent so the Auris ten atti is
doing a really good job with the
overclocks that I've put on it but the
next benchmark we're moving into is
Metro last line now this is another
interesting benchmarking that it does
utilize all the threads on the jewels
eons but it really utilizes them in a
low state I've heard that it can utilize
up to 64 threads
I believe when things are loading but in
the game it can utilize only 32 threads
max but this is where the jewel Xeon the
did score a quite a big loss compared to
the other two not just at 4k but also at
720p it really fell behind there and the
r7 1700 and the 7700 K did pull out
ahead which was really good to see that
they were performing almost neck and
neck in this benchmark because I know a
lot of people are going to be playing at
4k and higher resolutions and they want
to know how the r7 1700 performs for
that because maybe they got a
productivity workstation which does
generally like to have those higher
resolutions especially if you're doing
Premiere Pro workspace you want that
higher resolution in general so you can
do more work in general and then when
you obviously want to go and play games
after you've finished your work you want
something that'll be up to par I guess
and so this is where the higher
resolutions really start to make sense
for the r7 1700 it does start to score
pretty good results and pretty much
identical to the i7 7700 K but of course
having that extra productivity workroom
and the extra threads and the extra
power does help it out a lot in terms of
smoothness know you guys can see the
smoothness for yourself you guys can see
that if you pause it because it's at
60fps I've uploaded this video 60fps if
you pause it at any time during the
benchmarks you may be able to see some
screen tearing or whatnot
so if you guys are wondering about
stuttering or 0.1% or 1% lows you can
just guys you can just use your own eyes
at any point in this benchmark watch it
at 60fps playback and see if you notice
any stuttering on any of these three
rigs because I like to tune my pcs
really well I like to have them
lightweight running as little clutter as
possible and that shows when you've got
no stuttering and you've got a really
good experience
on all three pcs and what we see here is
on all three pieces the game is running
just amazing it's running really well
this is on the max settings on dx11 here
on metro life like many other game in
this benchmark for that matter you can
to see that the results are smooth as
data on all three pcs so of course the
r7 700 and the 7700 K do you come ahead
of the duels eons and that's probably
because you know of course we've got a
five-year old architecture there and of
course we only have three gigahertz of
clock speeds but one thing to note was
that these CPUs as we go from a 720p up
to 4k I do notice that the RAM usage
does start to go up a little bit I think
that's because and I made this mistake
by accident with the AMD risin freak I
accidentally selected RAM instead of
VRAM to show the usage and you proceed I
see anyone with a ram showing up but I'm
glad I did this in hindsight because we
got to see an extra insight into the
benchmarks and how things scale from low
to altra settings with things like
shadows and now this is rise of the Tomb
Raider and interesting even though it
lost at 720p the risin r7 1,700 wins
this benchmark and I went back and
double-check this but it does indeed
score a victory in the Tomb Raider
benchmark I was really surprised like
what the hell what's going on here but
double checked it and yeah sure it loses
at 720p but it wins at 4k so still it is
a victory and it is a victory for the
rise in CPU as you'll see when the
results come up a little bit later but I
wanted to talk also about people saying
oh man you should scrap rise of the Tomb
Raider
it's unoptimized or it's giving bad
results for an AMD CPU with an NVIDIA
GPU and I don't think that's or I don't
think any benchmark err should be
scrapping games out of their benchmark
suite because of one game suddenly
running bad on that because if you know
this is the case this has been the case
for a long time with games some games
run better on different hardware than
others it's always been the case since
PC gaming started out now if that game
is enjoyable and people go out and buy
that game and they want to play that
game why should we be scrapping them
from the bench
I mean Starcraft 2 for example it's
still a very popular title especially in
the competitive scene and it's only of
course it only utilizes two threads but
people still want to see those numbers
just because they don't align with an
eight-core sixteen thread CPU I don't
think we should be scrapping them I mean
I actually don't even bench Starcraft 2
to begin with but people have been
telling me that it's a crap game it's
the games like that should be scrapped
from benchmarks and games like Tomb
Raider should be scrapped from the
benchmarks the Tomb Raider is absolutely
fine gaming as you saw before it scored
a victory for the rising r7 700 so I
guess it's acceptable now because it
wins at higher resolutions I don't know
but as soon as it's telling people to
scrap games from their benchmarks guys I
don't think that's it that's a cool
thing to do I mean I don't think any
benchmarks should be scrapping any game
because it just runs crap on one piece
of hardware but of course if it is like
an Nvidia title and that benchmark err
is only testing Nvidia titles then of
course you might want to start
questioning hey throw in some AMD games
I am DL 2 my titles in there too to
balance things out but I don't think any
reviewer should be or any reviewer that
I know should be scrapping games just
because they don't favor one piece of
hardware explicitly or at least any
reviewer that I know who is reputable
out there will not be doing this for you
guys as we'd like to give you guys an
angle on all different games and how
they play because at the end of the day
if someone's going out there and buying
hardware for a specific game they will
want to know how it performs and if
people are scrapping games that people
like to play out of the benchmarks then
I guess how is anyone going to know how
their favorite title plays with
different hardware so that is a very
interesting insight and it is something
that I like to incorporate regardless as
we look at some people for example they
just go out and buy hardware for one
specific game and I know a lot of people
out there especially the multiplayer
competitive multiplayer titles wanna
just buy PCs for csgo or legal Legends
or dota 2 or some of things like World
of Warcraft so multiplayer benchmarks is
something that I do want to incorporate
a lot more into the channel however it
is something that is very difficult due
to the fact that it has a lot of
variants involved and that's something
that multiplayer is always going to have
so we can see here with the results the
f1 2016 scores the Intel did score a
victory in this benchmark over the r7
1700 and then of course the duels eons
came in dead last the poor Jules M
though the last benchmark I've got up
here is Ghost Recon wildlands and this
is a game that is again Max 16 threads
supported at least while benchmarking
this game we fear the jewels eons of
paul-jules eons again they come in dead
last though when I did drop this title
down to 16 cos 16 threads it did post
the highest score for those eons the r7
1700 does come in a little bit behind
the 7700 K in this title though it's
really not much to thread out so closing
up the benchmarks we can see that the i7
7700 K and the r7 1700 with their max
run-of-the-mill overclock on error water
they are scoring pretty similar scores
with one CPU edging out the other at 4k
and vice versa and so it is a pretty
even battle at 4k so if you guys are
looking to get a good CPU for
productivity and higher res gaming then
of course the r7 1700 is a really good
choice I can't really fault it in any
way shape or form but let's move over to
a conclusion so there these guys as you
expected the results there was really
nothing in it as you go up in
resolutions and this is pretty much
because we are now becoming GPU bound
but somewhere in between 720p and 4k the
results will pretty much scale in a
linear fashion in that it will come more
GPU bound and less CPU bound as you go
up in resolutions and vice versa and if
you guys make sure you stay tuned for
part 3 where I'm going to be doing some
productivity tests and also things like
multiplayer benchmarks and also some
streaming benchmarks so there'll be some
great inside there that will be coming
out of time 3 so I can't wait to bring
that to you and if you haven't already

subscribe and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
