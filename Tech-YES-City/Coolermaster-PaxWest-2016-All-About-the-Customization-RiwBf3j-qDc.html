here and I am joined by Kevin he has got
a lot of cool things to talk about from
coolermaster so how are you Kevin I'm
doing Greg we just actually ran through
this interview once but the camera just
somehow you know bricked itself but
we're to talk about the cooler master's
cases first up which they're making a
big push in the market with
customization not only that's some other
things yeah so with with our cases we
got a lot of we actually got a new case
coming out which be the master case pro
3 it's launching September six and we're
thinking that is more of like the little
brother of the master case five so it is
a micro ATX case whereas master you know
the match case five is a standard a HX
case a lot of cool cool features and
what kind of ties these two together
would be the freeform modular system and
so with the freeform mods modular system
that's basically full customization not
only inside the case where you know
where you can switch around all the
drive bays take out a lot of stuff but
also external as well so all the panels
the front doors I don't know if you guys
can see that probably not but the top
covers like if I could just take that
off get it on beer all get it up here
all day so yeah a lot of like a lot of
cool stuff a lot of customization like
you said it's all backed up also by
acessories that you can purchase
directly through either amazon newegg or
the CM store directly from us so a lot
of good customization there yes so
making a big push not only in the
products but also the customer service
and the availability of the products as
well now one thing I've noticed being
here is well they got the keyboards as
well the new master keys pro so you want
to get a little bit about that as well
with the different sizes and the whole
fatter LED thing is you're explaining
before you exactly fatter LED know so
yeah we have a basically the master keys
series and we're trying to really
simplify the purchasing some having a
bunch of different keyboards with a
bunch of different names like we have in
the past we're saying okay keyboards the
master
and basically we end up separating it by
small medium large or small would be the
10 key less meat medium would be where
you have the tankiez combined with the
arrow keys then largely the full
standard sized keyboard and so after you
know you kind of pick your size which
type you want then you can end up just
saying all right now do I want our RGB
or a kind of a pure white color that's
one that you know like the RGB you can't
really get through that or no colors
because some people for work or
something you know and so with that
being said what you will just alluded to
the fat LEDs we looked around you know
the mark we've seen it what a lot of
people are doing and as cool and master
you know we like to innovate well let's
come up with new things I me where the
company of that invented heat pipes for
Christ's sake you know and so I was like
all right what can we do and the
keyboards to make a different stand out
so we basically ended up reinventing the
PCB we ended up taking the we took the
board and we drilled holes in individual
holes through efforts behind every
single key to and really let the LED pop
and shine right through so we're able to
use a bigger LED and it has a real nice
pastel look to it I think I think our
keyboards especially the RG B's look
really nice a real nice solid perky bat
backlighting and another thing that
makes a standout is I know a lot of
competitors to you have to use a lot of
software you know it's a program all of
it well with our keywords you can use
the software too but what's also great
about ours is it's all one hundred
percent on the fly so you can so you can
program it from the keyboard itself on
the save your hardware profiles as well
all the hardware profiles all the perky
backlighting different modes we also
have online we have a lot of people in
the community there are uploading a lot
of their own lighting modes that you can
then go on and download so a lot of cool
stuff with our keyboards going on so
awesome with those fata lights as well I
guess Christmas is going to look a lot
better with one of these keyboards
around the house yeah definitely
definitely you heard it from Kevin
himself so keyboards looking good I know
a lot of you guys want to know an update
as well on the cooler master 212 evo 10
cooler master's most populous if not the
most popular cooler of all time for the
cpus any update
we're going to expect some may be fresh
products on the market yeah um as I said
we're gonna we've been uh yeah we've
been coming out with a whole product
line this year we have a lot of products
in fact we've been very tired over a
cooler master because a starting i think
in july basically from july to the end
of the year we're launching like 78 new
products so every week we're coming out
with two or three new products were just
pumping them out and so with that being
said of course with air coolers we got a
whole new line coming out we released
early in the year the master air maker 8
and so that's the real beastly big our
flagship air cooling product and we're
looking for either later this month or
in October we're going to be releasing a
full line a full line of air coolers are
from you know the entry level all the
way to you know the best that you can
get so really cool stuff look about
it'll be and it just like with our with
our master key series they'll all be
called master air great we heard that so
all those new products coming hopefully
one of those products is a mini ITX case
though we can uh no word on that no
official word I was just seeing all this
beautiful tempered glass now one could
only imagine if one were to get a mini
ITX case with tempered glass that would
be really cool sign me up uh yeah no
comment on the mini ITX case as I said
we got a lot also like so with the mat
with the master case going in the
completely opposite direction of the
busy I texts so we have like the match
case pro 3 which is you know the micro
we have the match case five standard HX
everywhere coming out with the master
case 7 which is going to be a full tower
almost like a coming off of the cosmos
too so those are looking out wanting a
new cosmos too that's going to be really
cool really big case I'm going with the
opposite direction this yeah but we're
