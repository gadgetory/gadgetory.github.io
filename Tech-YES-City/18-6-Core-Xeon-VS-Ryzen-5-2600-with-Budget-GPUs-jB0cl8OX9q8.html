finished testing the six core $18 eon
that's the e5 2420 v2 if you haven't
seen that video ready I'll put the link
up here where basically that's CPU for
the money is really good when you couple
it with something like an Rx 570 or a
gtx 1650 but on that note it got me
thinking since Reisen CPUs are great
value in the new market how much of a
difference in performance is there going
to be between say a verizon 520 600
which is also a 6 core 12 threaded CPU
and the CPU in yesterday's video these
six core twelve threaded Ivy Bridge Xeon
so before we even get into the nuts and
bolts of this video I will say if you're
going to go out and buy an RT X xx 70 or
Vega 56 or Radeon 7 then definitely
spend more money on a CPU
than an $18 Ian I think everyone in the
world would know that a $500 graphics
card is going to bottleneck an $18 CPU
but what about these entry-level cards
like the GTX 1650 like the rx 570 so
that leaves the question of is the
$18.00 CPU going to bottleneck these two
graphics cards or is it going to be
money well spent
well there's only one way to find that
out and that's do some benchmarking so
let's get on into it
so we got to test systems set up in the
studio here this one being the first and
it's got the risin be 450 motherboard
it's an MSI budget board great value for
money and it's also coupled with 16
gigabytes of ddr4 memory which is also a
great choice for people getting into PC
gaming and want to get value for money
now this isn't thirty two hundred
megahertz stuff but for the first
scenario here we're going to test the
six core with out-of-the-box settings so
we're not gonna be tuning anything but
then we're going to come back and tune
it up and see how much of a performance
difference that makes and then over here
we've got the Xeon system and that's
going to be to sporting the sixteen
fifty after it's done testing on the
rosin system and then we're gonna switch
over the RX 572 the Rison system to so
we're gonna be doing a switch-a-rooney
here and then getting some numbers for
you guys and seeing just how much of a
difference there is
so the results are now in for this
budget CPU on to budget graphics cards
versus the horizon five 2600 and the
results are really weird actually and
they're pretty interesting we're gonna
go through them one by one but first off
we'll pull up Apex legends now I decided
to test on medium settings just to get
more out of the FPS potentially
bottleneck the Xeon even harder than
what it may be getting bottlenecked if
there was a bottleneck and so we can see
here the gtx 1650 didn't present any
bottlenecks pretty much whatsoever and
in fact the rise in memory tweaks and
also upping the clock speeds the 3.8 you
give us on all caused really only showed
a two FPS boost over rising out of the
box and so this is if anything just goes
to show how well made apex legends is in
comparison at least to the other games
that we've got here on display so
there's pretty much only a 2 FPS
difference at best on the gtx 1650
moving over to the RX 570 however the
xeon is falling a little bit behind it's
nothing to write home about especially
considering the value proposition of the
xeon with either of these two graphics
cards but the rise in memory speeds did
make a 3 FPS difference here versus a 2
FPS difference even though that's kind
of scaling to the two GPUs here the 1%
in point one percent loads are
absolutely fine on this title so if
anything apex Legends is going to give
you a great experience on either both
these CPUs whether they're tuned or not
on an RX 570 or a gtx 1650 now moving
over to dota 2 here's where we did start
to see the trend break away here in that
the Rison did score more FPS and that's
due to at having a much higher in this
case a single-threaded clock speed then
the Zeon's 2.5 gigahertz but another
thing I did notice is that the memory
speeds at least on the Radeon side of
things the RX 570 actually made a big
difference as opposed to the gtx 1650
side of things so here's where the
weirdness starts to come into these
benchmarks but if anything it's
something i've also noticed in relation
to the 16th
the RX 570 in this title they're coming
very close and in fact a lot closer than
some of the other titles and also on
that note out of the box settings at
default into twenty four hundred
megahertz CL fifteen so that's what we
went with for these tests but basically
having the arisin five 2600 versus the
$18.00 eon in this game will give you a
FPS boost it is quite substantial but
here's where we're gonna still pull back
to the average FPS figures it's 85 and
90 and this is where you're going to get
a really good experience still
especially on a budget sixty Hertz
monitor so the FPS is good in this title
but it is a lot better on the rise and
CPU but again if you're a competitive
gamer you're going to be definitely
knowing that you need the max FPS
possible then you're gonna go out and
spend the extra money to get the better
gear potentially at 144 Hertz monitor if
you even that good and you're into the
scene maybe a 240 Hertz monitor of it
let's move out out of the next title
hitman two this is the first of the DX
12 titles that were testing here and
it's not surprisingly showing that the
results are pretty much identical across
the field here with the Z on pretty much
coming really close to rising out of the
box and both rise and tuned so if
anything in this particular title there
isn't a whole lot of difference between
these CPUs even when you tune up the
Rison on CL 1430 200 megahertz but also
on that note it is good to see that as
the newer titles come out they're taking
advantage of more cores more threads and
this means that the budget CPUs like
this $18 Xeon and now performing really
well at least in this particular title
and now we did test at 1080p medium
settings as well so just to extract as
much FPS out of these two budget
graphics cards as possible without
having the game look too terrible
but now moving back to csgo and here's
where we saw a little bit of a weird one
where the gtx 1650 on the budget Xeon
ended up beating out the RX 570 scoring
124 average FPS versus a hundred and
twenty FPS but then we move over to the
rise in CPUs and the rise in both
with the out-of-the-box settings and
also tune settings then pulled a head
off the GTX 16:50 that is by quite a bit
so this was a pretty interesting result
and csgo if anything does show you if
you overclock your cpu and you've got
very sensitive settings with memory and
CPU clock speeds then this game will
benefit greatly from those extra clock
speeds and memory speeds so we saw 208
FPS with the GTX 1615 that one up to 228
and then over to the RX 570 side of
things we then saw 233 getting a
substantial boost of 271 so if there's
one trend that I can already see with
these numbers that is that the RX 570
does demand in comparison to the gtx
1650 slightly higher clock speeds on the
single thread and also higher memory
speeds so now we've added a last title
resident evil' to 1080p high settings DX
12 is this setting we've tested on and
surprisingly the xeon on the RX 570 side
of things scored a victory over both
rising out of the box and rise and tuned
and this is where things get a little
bit awkward because i'm sitting here
scratching my head like i double-checked
all the settings and this is what was
happening so this one's a bit of an
outlier but when we move over to the gtx
1650 side of things we then had a slight
victory with the rising out-of-the-box
and both tuned but they scored pretty
much the same so if anything the Xeon
versus the rise in 520 600 there wasn't
a huge difference with both these
graphics cards but we'll move over to
conclusion now and talk about a little
bit more in depth so here's the crux of
today's video if you're going to go out
and buy the $18.00 Eon and couple it
with a budget graphics card then you're
gonna have very good price performance
on your hands and one thing we saw was
the new of the title the more it
supports multi-threading and this is
important for this CPU since it is only
clocking to 2.5 gigahertz across 6 cores
12 threads it does need the game to
better utilize more cause more threats
and this in turn will balance out the
results especially on budget GPUs
compared to the rising fire
2,600 now of course the Rosen 520 600
does have its merits is an extremely
good value for money CPU on the new
market and also when you couple it with
a higher-end graphics card like an RT X
2070 or a Vega 56 or even going high to
the Radeon 7 or the 2080 ti you're going
to see a much larger gap in these two
CPUs but on that note with these two
CPUs in hand it is important to note
that one's $18 and the others over $150
brand-new but also on top of that the
motherboard costs and also the ddr3
memory costs are very low with this
particular CPU so getting this stuff
shipped out anywhere in the world is the
benefit of this combo that I've
mentioned here and the results are
looking really good for it and that's
going to Delhi solve the problem of a
lot of people in the world who can't get
access to good prices on new rising
hardware as well as good prices on used
hardware and I get this a lot where
people complain to me about their used
market locally being bad so this kind of
CPU and this combo that I'm talking
about here is a great staple for someone
who can't get access to good prices in
their area but anyway guys as time moves
on in games do adopt DirectX 12 and
these better api's as well as become
better multi-threaded we're gonna see
the cpu demand side of things become
less and less and so that in turn is
enabling us now to spend more money on a
graphics card and get a better gaming
experience which is an awesome thing to
see and today's results definitely show
that some of those all the titles like
dota 2 csgo did run better on the Rison
system and even in that own field when
you overclocked the Rison system or even
gave it a bit of a turn especially on
the memory side of things it saw some
big gains in those two particular titles
but the other three titles which were
pretty modern didn't show much gain at
all and on that note I hope you enjoyed
today's video if you did be sure to hit
that like button also let us know in the
comments section below what do you think
of both these CPUs the $18.00 Eon and
the rise of 5 2600 I honestly love both
of them I think they're both great value
for money depending on what you're doing
but today's video just showed if you're
going with an $18 CPU and you're
coupling with a budget GPU which I'm
assuming most people would logically do
then it's going to give you some great
price performance but on that note don't
go buying an $18 CPU and then going out
and spending $500 on a graphics card and
then complaining about a bottleneck you
should be balancing out things a little
bit better if you're thinking of doing
that with that aside I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
