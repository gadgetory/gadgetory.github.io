can
yes fixing this is that episode where
you guys send in all your broken PC
parts or parts that you just don't need
and you see if I can fix them or tweak
them and if I can't then generally
they're going straight to the pool booth
I said let's start tackling all these
problems and sin if we can diagnose them
but I do apologize too because this
episode has been a long time in the
making and the stuff has just been sort
of piling up here and I did get those
health videos and Darth Jar Jar done so
that took a lot out of the schedule but
with that said we're back on schedule
now so I do apologize if I forgot some
of the people's names who sent this
stuff in but anyway let's see what
shenanigans we can get up to today's
view is brought to you by asrock and
sometimes you just might need a break
from the wd-40 and the data back then if
so the Z 390 Tai Chi is your perfect
choice if you're on the market for a
brand new 9900 K this thing will
overclock it with ease with the 10 phase
V RM and amazing onboard audio you're
shorter play some faces or crush them in
games if that's your forte links in
description below to find out more
so first up here we've got a heap of
different stuff sent in from Jon over in
the US he sent in some SSDs and said
that they weren't showing up when he
tried to install them you know computers
as boot drives and so I do have a
solution for that and he's also got some
CPUs which he hasn't tested and they may
or may not work so we'll get on very
soon with those after we test out these
motherboards here but let's quickly show
you guys how you can get an SSD that's
possibly not booting from a fresh
install of Windows to work after you do
this little trick
so that was just ridiculously easy to
check these three drives out and see
which one was faulty and in the case of
this 240 gigabyte drive oh here that
unfortunately just hung in Windows so
it's going to be a brick drive you're
gonna have problems with that no matter
what you do unless of course you're into
soldiering and you can find the bad
components on this drive and replace it
but these two here they're absolutely
fine so we can use them in builds so
thank you for that John
so now we're on to motherboards and I do
tackle these two different ways if the
person says it works then I quickly
check if it does work before I put it in
a build but if I've been donated it and
it's broken then I generally just go
straight to a tech yes love and cleanse
and that's where I just go in this case
I'm gonna use a bit of brake cleaner and
then clean the board up and then give it
a bit of wd-40 or a multipurpose spray
and make sure that it's all schmick
before we give it that chance now in the
case of LGA pins here we may need to
bend these back some of them might have
micro bends or whatnot and then after
that if the board just doesn't work at
all then we will toss it but anyway let
the love and begin
so there's a for motherboards they're
all ready to go but you may have noticed
the data vac is looking a little bit
different and that's because early in
the month it needed its own tech yes
loving basically what happened was I was
turning it on and then it just shorted
out the whole circuit here in my home
and it did it a couple of times I'm like
what is going on so I opened it up and
there was a positive braided wire like
literally right next to open- wire and
so I think one of the screws was
actually going through the positive
braid of wire and causing that to short
with the negative but it's all fixed now
and it's all ready to go so hopefully
there's no more problems with it
and also you guys have been hounding me
for a long time to get a proper test
bench so I not only got one of these I
got two and a cool master did us a favor
because apparently these are becoming
end-of-line so they needed to get rid of
them I'm like dude I could definitely
use these they're awesome because
they're really small and really
lightweight basically the whole size of
the full sized motherboard and you get a
power supply in underneath and also your
drive bays and you've got a power and
reset button let's test out these four
motherboards and see if they can work
so now tested all the five motherboards
that I had I didn't bother giving this
cleaning because it looked really new
and I believe the person before Alex who
sent it in I believe it was just trying
to get a rise in 2000 series chip in
here and it's just one of those things
that's very easy I've got a rise in
three 1200 I put that in there and it
booted up so that's absolutely fine this
here after some check yes loving this
booted up absolutely fine as well this
Intel board here I tried using the
external flasher on it except I've got
no idea what BIOS chip this actually
takes and so I was really confused I
tried looking on the net everywhere and
I just came up empty-handed so if
someone does know what exact flash ROM
this is let us know in the comment
section below so I can give it a proper
attempt on flashing it in the meantime
I've just got no idea so I kind of have
to sideline this motherboard right here
and then of course these two
motherboards here are on the trash pile
this asrock extreme sticks just had
absolutely no signal at all so it's a
completely gone board this z77 is just
constantly boot cycling you can't even
get the back up bias to initiate so that
thing is toast as well I'm guessing some
of the traces have gone and we decided
to give it some lovin in the air
however off that extreme six motherboard
I did pull off the two BIOS chips these
can come in handy especially when you've
got a motherboard that fits these chips
we can then program and with our
programmer to whatever we like and that
BIOS is now in our hands so now let's
move on to testing out all these
different CPUs and RAM this is pretty
straightforward if it boots it's
generally ok with the RAM however you I
would like to run a stress test usually
my prime95 blend test is a go-to before
I actually get a PC ready to flip so in
that case I'm gonna see which one's boot
with the RAM and then after that if I'm
putting them in a build I'll leave it
overnight with a blend test and if it
fails then I'll have to find out which
stick is failing so that's a lengthy
process but in the meantime we can just
quickly test one by one see what boots
in our newly restored HD 3 motherboard
and then come back to some of this other
juicy stuff
so we just finished testing up the CPUs
here and four of the six worked two of
them just were giving no signal so we
decided to scrap those so these can go
in the pile of working parts but now
let's test out the memory while we're
here and actually was going to test it
out with the other board but this is the
g1 sniper and this thing looks so cool
so we finished testing up the RAM there
was three sticks that were faulty so
we're gonna chuck them in the rubbish
bin but we got a heap a different memory
that is all good so far so that's gonna
be great in the kitty and then over here
we've got two power supplies now but I
didn't get donated these I actually
bought them in a bundle of seven where
I've already sold three of the power
suppliers and then I've made $10 profit
I've got to keep four of them however
two of these power supplies didn't come
with CPU eight pin connectors so what
we're gonna do is use this digital
multimeter here to read out these
proprietary connections even though
they're eight pins and a lot of other
power suppliers have eight pin
connections and what a lot of these
companies do is they actually change all
the routing around so basically it's if
you use another company's connector
you're gonna have the wrong voltages
going to the wrong pins and so that's
going to cause problems but if we use a
multimeter we can then rearrange things
and see how they perform so now for this
next part we simply get our motherboard
and put a short connector on it which
allows the power supply then to start
and we'll have active voltages in these
pins here and this is the 12-volt pin so
we want the top four to be positive and
the bottom four to be negative so we
simply turn it on now the fan should
start spinning and ideally would want to
hit this with positive and then this one
with negative and we can see that that's
actually the other way around so that
one they're switched in this case so
that their top one is negative so now we
can go around and test its that bottom
ones positive as well that's positive as
well and that's positive as well
and since we know these bottom four
positive now we can then go on the top
here and we can see that that's negative
that's negative
and that's negative so this one here is
actually just reversed so I think a very
quick and easy fix for this would just
be to simply grab the power supply grab
this connector here I mean I could be
wrong but give it a go simply turn it
upside down and just Ram that in and
let's try that again
success success success success getting
past proprietary modular power supply
connectors has never been easier just
flip it upside down then again I think
according to you guys over in the u.s.
in Australia that's normal so we did the
exact same trick on the other power
supply there this time with a corsair
CPU 8 pin and that worked exactly the
same as the thermal take a pin where we
flipped it upside down and it was now
working correctly now what we got left
here on the desk is a old logitech
trackball mice and I mean this thing
just came like this it's so like it's
really filthy like I don't even know
what that is could that give me a
disease or something like I mean guys
when you send some stuff in like I
really appreciate getting sense I'm like
the motherboards and the RAM and stuff
but like I I don't know what I'm
supposed to do with this okay
I mean I'd give us some check yes loving
except I might get a disease from it but
I did get these two old gravis cards
here I am keen to test them out
apparently they do work but I do have a
video coming up for you guys where I'm
gonna be testing some of these old
potato cards so I look forward to
hopefully featuring them in that video
and then behind that the last of the
stuff I got sent in here was a lot of
cables from a guy in Singapore he
actually didn't even leave his name on
the envelope he's just sent over a lot
of different cables and so here's a lot
of LAN cables these here I actually
don't need these so if someone in the
audience needs some telephone cables let
us know I'll gladly give them away too
and there was a heap of different power
cables that got sent in so a big thanks
for that but I guess it's now time to
conclude everything that's on the desk
here because I guess today's episode
really sums up what it's all about and
that's small victories so there
Elizabeth today's episode and I'm
actually really excited because
everything today just went so smooth
the stuff just didn't work or it worked
I didn't have any problems where it was
giving me a flicking screen or there was
a message that would come up it was just
straightforward we had the RAM that
either didn't work or it worked
and in most cases with the CPUs and the
RAM a lot of it did work so this stash
has just gotten bigger and so now I've
got more stuff that I can use in future
builds and speaking of builds we've got
those five builds coming for the school
very soon finally have found four of the
kids that were going to be giving them
away to I've actually selected the
winners I'll be making a separate video
on that and I'm also going to be giving
one of the extra computers away to the
school itself so everyone at that school
can use it it's been a long time coming
but that's coming very soon also on top
of that the power supplies we got kind
of lucky where we've just flipped the
CPU eight pins around and they worked
perfectly has two very good module power
supplies that I can use in builds and
also the motherboards that did work
there were the good ones so except for
the extreme six that just flat out had
no power going to it whatsoever so I'm
really confused what happened there
because usually you at least get like
the USB ports lining up the keyboard for
example and we didn't even have that
with that multiple it was just
completely gone and then lastly of
course that Intel motherboard that
needed to be programmed I just didn't
know what flash ROM it was exactly so if
someone does know in the description
below I'd love to hear that and give it
a try and try and bring that board back
to life as in a previous video a build I
did it bricked when I was doing the
update via Windows which was the only
way you could update the BIOS on that
motherboard and yeah try not to update
your BIOS through Windows it's not good
now better than that in today's episode
you can see how we cleaned a lot of
stuff and we just try to avoid problems
from the get-go and now the whole
process around here is so efficient
where I'm just doing things and not
trying to waste time and so I'll clean
those motherboards clean them very
effectively very efficiently same with
the RAM and CPUs I even gave them a
clean and so I know that that's not the
problem after that and I've brought so
much stuff back to life by just giving
it a thorough clean and a lot of people
are messaging me behind the scene
saying the same techniques and processes
have saved a lot of PC parts especially
when people come to them or they're
selling in their local area and they say
this whole computer is faulty and they
go around and they buy it and then they
can actually get the whole bill back to
life so that was really cool but other
than that guys I hope you enjoyed
today's episode if you did then be sure
to hit that like button also if you have
any pots that you want to send in to us
then I'll put my p.o box in the
description below any parts that you may
not need or you just want to see me mess
around with them then you're welcome to
send them in however in terms of
donating parts that are worth a good
amount of money and you guys know that
they work I do employ you guys to donate
those to people in need around your
local area it's sort of like an
initiative that I started from last year
when the channel started to build up but
of course if you want to support the
channel link for the merchants in the
description below and also there's my
patreon link if you just want to trust
us a tip and get access to monthly
behind-the-scenes vlogs and with that
said I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon peace out for now buddy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
