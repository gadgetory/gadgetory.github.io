of these actually two of these
mechanical RGB keyboards I've been
nothing but impressed with them and I'm
gonna give you guys a review as you
haven't requested it a lot welcome back
to check yet City this is brian coming
to you guys today with the review of the
mg k1 RGB keyboard my new favorite
mechanical keyboard actually my new
favorite keyboard in general and i'm
gonna tell you guys why I like this
keyboard so much so getting straight off
into it is the price I managed to pick
up one of these things will actually two
of them Wyles in America for $90 a pop
and I'll put the link in the description
below if you guys wish to check it out
but another great feature about this
unit is it features Koh blue switches
which actually have a higher actuation
point than Cherry MX switches so will be
slightly better for gaming now also
typing on these switches is a little bit
noisy since they do have two levels of
feedback and I'll let you guys listen to
the noise right now moving on to the RGB
lighting which is another awesome
feature of this keyboard you've got six
different modes there which are
controlled from the keyboard itself so
that's right you don't need any software
to use this keyboard which is one of my
favorite things about it even though it
doesn't have a lot of different modes to
choose from it's enough for me for
someone who just wants to get that
backlighting and also change the colors
on the fly and this definitely serves
the purpose looking at the key caps they
are made of ABS plastic and they do have
hallow backlighting there to allow the
light to come through in the dark also
another thing is not to be disappointed
that these are made of ABS plastic
because the keyboard itself is only $90
now moving on to the build quality this
unit it has a black anodized alloy
machined backplate there which I
absolutely love the look of it and it
also adds to the qualitative feel of the
product and then they also include a
wrist rest which actually has a decent
grip that you will be able to type on
and not get annoyed with now moving on
to the back of the keyboard we have two
levels of adjustment there with the
actual levels or the levers being made
of steel and moving on to the cable it
is a very thick braided cable they're
measuring up to around one
point eight meters moving on to the
bottom of the keyboard there you've got
the rubberized grips that allowed it to
grip the table you've also got the
mountain that if we wish to dismount or
mount the actual keyboard rests there
and then moving on to the last part of
the features on this keyboard is the NCW
lighting therefore num lock caps lock
and scroll lock and then you've also got
the volume lever there which you can
change on the fly from the keyboard so I
can't say enough good things about this
keyboard I really can't critique
anything about it especially for the $90
price point at this price point you're
getting a mechanical keyboard that is
really well built and this is surprising
coming from a company that I've never
heard of before as you but at least
they've made a bang in the keyboard
market and this keyboard is going to
keep selling like hotcakes because I
absolutely love it now I would like to
see a zero introduce different variants
of it like the brown the Reds and the
clears for whoever likes those key
switches but for me personally being the
blue being my favorite I absolutely love
this keyboard and the features that it
offers especially the fact that it
doesn't use software and you don't even
need an extraction manual to use this
keyboard on the back it's just got all
the modes they're written clearly and
you refresh the function key play around
with the different settings and you'll
learn how to use this keyboard within a
couple of minutes gonna be giving this
keyboard 5 out of 5 stars because I was
blown away not only by the value for
money but also the total build quality
of this unit it is simply one phenomenal
job as you have done with this keyboard
and I cannot highly recommend it enough
to people out there if they're looking
for an RGB backlit blue switched
keyboard I actually bought one of these
and then I immediately bought a second
one after trying it out for a day
because it was just that good value for
money Wales in the States now people
might think that the lack of
customization is a negative about this
keyboard however for me it's a positive
since I don't have to install any
software and there's pretty much no
learning curve there unlike the software
modded razer RGB and corsair RGB
keyboards and before you say Brian you
haven't tried these keyboards I actually
did try the corsair RGB k70 and i
preferred this over that which is kind
of a little bit of a sad think since
corsair do have an amazing track record
I just wish they would have simplified
their keyboard a little bit more or at
least how to switch on the back to put
it in simple mode or advanced mode
that's maybe some feedback for course
there
you guys are looking to buy one of those
keyboards but anyway that's about it for
me today guys if you have any questions
or comments then be sure to drop a
comment in the comment section below and
I will get back to you as soon as I can
