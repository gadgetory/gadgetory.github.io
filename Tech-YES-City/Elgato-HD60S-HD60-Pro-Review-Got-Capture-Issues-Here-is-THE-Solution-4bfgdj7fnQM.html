something that I've needed for a long
time and that is a capture card and i'll
Gardo kacica warned attack city this is
brian i hope you are all doing mighty
fine and when i met up with the awesome
people at el gato impacts at seattle i
was very interested in what their
capture cards could do and having had my
head buried in used parts and doing many
tutorials for you guys for a while with
people complaining about how the screen
looks bad on camera numerous of times I
decided to test out an elgato capture
card and see what magic pool and seeing
her firsthand really surprised me here
was something that could not only solve
the problems of capturing BIOS footage
in high quality but also something that
came loaded with features for anyone
really with a monitor or TV it can also
do so much more than just capture
gameplay footage - first up you can
record 1080p 60fps footage from your
consoles if you have a ps4 and Xbox one
or from another PC or your own PC if you
have a second monitor that you're
playing games on I found what I tried
this on my brother's playstation 4 there
was zero drop on performance and
everything was still smooth as butter
and then when going into the computer's
bios which is the boot configuration
settings that are important for setting
up a computer and tuning it as best as
you can I found I could capture the
picture without having to use my camera
which usually resulted in a bad picture
the elgato everytime was just putting
out crisp quality footage and this
footage is adjustable in both bit rate
and FPS - you can change it from one
megabit per second all the way up to 60
megabits per second 30 or 60 FPS you can
also capture audio incoming - even from
that of a microphone also when using the
PC instead of having to use apps like
shadow play
I can now benchmark make games without
having to double take footage and I can
also play games recording quality plays
without having any hiccups or
performance dips another great feature
of both the HD capture cards that I have
here is that they have the software
suite which comes included with both
products and offers things like
different layouts custom banner rings
and even setting up twitch donation
settings and labeling so you can get
straight into streaming hassle-free and
the look is very professional - it is
things like these that are going to save
gamers and stream is a lot of hassle on
time and lastly someone like me a lot of
complaints
viewers so now I have two models here
that I will quickly go over the
differences between both the hd60 pro
PCIe mounted card fits into your
computer internally and plugs into a
PCIe port this will then enable 1080p
60fps capture which can then be saved to
the said computer that the capture card
is slotted into then there is the HD 60s
which is a USB 3 version and captures in
much the same way except you will need
an additional USB 3 cable and also this
device will only work with a fork or
fourth gen CPU or grater and will still
require a native USB 3 port so if you
have these and I think the HD 60 F
offers a little bit more flexibility now
found myself using it more so than the
HD 60 pro as I can plug it into any
device quickly and maneuver around and
then easily set up capture on the other
hand the HD 60 profound gave a much
cleaner look to the setup since you
didn't have another cable that you
needed to run and it also sits inside
the PC plus it does avoid that
additional layer of connectivity for
instance if you have a USB port die on
you or something you could come into
some additional problems that you
wouldn't have on the pro version so
there it is the HD 60 pro and the HD 60
s from El Gato 2 units which are
extremely useful for anyone even
remotely serious about capturing quality
gameplay footage doing tutorials and/or
streaming to viewers with no hiccups the
software is incredibly easy to use in
the final output files are efficient too
and won't take up much space on your
hard drive especially for how the final
picture looks overall a great product
and coming in to around about 173 us for
the USB 3 HD 60s and 170 USD for the HD
60 pro PCIe version also if you're in
Australia then it'll set you back around
about 269 and 280 AUD respectively
anyways I hope you enjoyed this review
of the elgato capture cards and if you
did then be sure to hit that like button
let me know in the comments section
below
do you record gameplay footage and if so
what system will setup do you currently
use we'd love to hear your comments and
opinions as always and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
