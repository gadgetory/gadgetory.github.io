today we've got the B 360 ml that's the
micro ATX motherboard and it's going on
the test bench and we're gonna be
putting the 8700 K on this thing and
testing out the V RMS now of course with
the B series and also the H series you
generally can't overclock at all
sometimes you can get out the max
multipliers however we're gonna find
that out today because I haven't even
given this thing a test run yet just got
back from overseas but let's see what
this motherboard is all about and we'll
do a full tour here at take your city so
stay tuned and strap on in and let's get
on with this motherboard review
so now we've got everything installed
we've booted it up but we had a lot of
issues getting this thing to boot up for
the first time and I tried different
coolers I tried different memory tried
different GPUs tried different slots of
memory tried different keyboards even
try to Pierce to keyboard and the
problem was initially was the actual
socket itself was not slotting in the
CPU 100% correctly and I found this out
when I was just about to give up and
then I noticed that the CPU socket when
I put it in this it sort of like had
this little weird noise and then I
reinserted it and then just slotted it
around like shook it around like an
earthquake and then latch the CPU down
again and now it's working absolutely
okay so I've got the 8400 in here at the
moment I own attest vrm temperatures
first CPU temperatures are kind of
irrelevant cuz I've literally got a CPU
cooler just sitting on top of the CPU at
the moment doing nothing as I thought
maybe the mounting kit could have caused
the problem but yeah if if I'm having
this problem then I'm pretty sure
someone else out there may come into
this problem so could be a little
problem with the socket itself not
inserting the CPU 100% correctly never
really encountered a problem like this
before but now that I know what the
problem was we can get on with the
testing and trying it in 8700 k and -
one thing about the memory speeds
already is that they're maxing out at 20
666 and the CPU even though you can
technically lock in higher ratios it
will allow us to lock in 3200 in the
BIOS but it'll just hard cap itself or
2666 same with the CPU ratio it sort of
does say that you can go higher I tried
locking in for and it's now at 3/8 even
on that 4 that's locked in the boss but
with that aside let's get those vrm
temperatures tested on this B 360 a here
left channel left channel left channel
right Channel right Channel right
channel left channel left channel left
channel so we just finished up the tests
and the vrm with the 8,400 which is
using about 55 watts at least in the ida
64 power test that's what it's telling
me it's using it got to around about 83
degrees so I'm a little bit concerned
already because we're going to change
over now to the 8700 K and of course see
the max multi we can lock in with this
board but also see those vrm
temperatures you know I'm getting a
little bit scared already now for the
performance we've got a Cinebench score
open here 960 points roughly very good
so the CPU is working absolutely fine on
this motherboard so if you want to go
with a non k cpu not sure about the 8700
but you want to get for an 8400 and a
budget motherboard it will work out of
the box absolutely fine now I did also
test the onboard audio and it's pretty
loud like it's actually louder than the
Z 370 gigabyte I have here the crosstalk
doesn't have that problem as well when
you turn it over a 90 volume so it's
funny because the motherboards now
they're starting to have this problem
that's been Olevia it's been fixed and
also the line in test I'll let you guys
have a quick listen to see the mic in
port with the noise
so now with that mic in port you could
hear that surprisingly a hundred volume
introduces noise even at plus 20 DB but
50 volume and plus 30 decibels was
actually really good so they've maybe
put on even even better mic import this
time around with the B 360m a also
there's that that crosstalk problem
isn't there but the frequency response
curve was a little bit worrisome because
at least past one kilohertz I saw that
it started to wave a little bit it
started to become imbalanced before 20
Hertz as well you had about a 2 decibel
drop-off from 10 to 20 Hertz had about a
point to decibel drop-off so the numbers
were pretty solid it's definitely okay
if you want to get a budget pair of
headphones and you need it to be quite
loud this motherboard will do that but
for people who love audio and have a
decent even a mid-grade set of
headphones then you are gonna get an
imbalance sound out of this motherboard
but let's put in that 80 700 K now do
some further testing and get to the
bottom of this motherboard
so finishing up testing with the ozu's
be 360m - a motherboard couldn't get the
8700 K to work unfortunately the closest
I got was getting into the boss and then
it froze and then ever since then I've
tried for like countless times to do
this and I've actually tried for over a
few hours now can't get this 8700 K to
work even though in the manual it does
have the 8700 K working in this BIOS so
it will work and if it's anything to go
by the 8700 and the 8700 K they both go
up to four point three gigahertz on all
cause without MCE which is a feature
available on the z3 70 motherboards the
biggest difference though was the of
course but the 8700 the 8700 at K which
allows you to overclock and of course
you can't overclock on the B 360
motherboards you can only get the memory
up to 20 666 and I've confirmed this now
with a few different modules and also
the stress testing showed that the 8400
the V RMS are going into the mid-80s so
if you were to put an 8700 on it which
goes up to just below a hundred watts I
believe you may have a little bit of a
problem on some of these motherboards if
you don't have vrm cooling or if you
don't have a fan my best advice would be
if you are on a budget you want to get
an 87 hundred on like a B 360 or a
cheaper H motherboard then I would put a
fan over that vrm that will enable you
to get those temps law because as you
get closer to that T Junction point
which can be sometimes 125 degrees or a
little bit higher you do start to come
into problems and sometimes you can
throttle your CPU or throttle the
motherboard and sometimes I can just
switch off entirely if it's really bad
conditions for instance the ambient
temperatures are really bad but another
thing I did notice with this motherboard
as well does have Intel rst and not rst
premium which is the reserved for the z3
70 motherboards so in other words I
don't think you can raid 0 PCIe nvme
drives on the B 360 chipset the H 370 or
H 310 I'm not sure yet I mean whenever
that comes in I will be testing that for
you guys but as it stands be 360 has
just the RS team non
Premium so it will work with obtain
memory I think but again obtain memory
as one of those things that cost like 60
bucks I think so I'm not sure how many
people are keen on doing that but B 360
for what it's worth
great little board if you want to put in
a non overclocking CPU and get that all
core ratio and you'll be good to go so
yeah it should work with the 8700 just I
didn't get a chance to test the
temperatures here today but I'm sure
it'll be okay
and you guys hope you enjoyed today's
video on the b-36 TM from a Zeus when
other stuff comes in and I get to test
that I will be letting you guys know all
the ins and outs and it's just
unfortunate the a 700 K couldn't work I
don't know my guess would be the socket
and the deal it at CPU it just didn't
like the D lated CPU anyway guys I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye
what we get stuck on this is what put in
a 8700 K problem still persists I will
be guys you're at why is that so
unlit uneven super dark Hey
see here I'm editing the video and I'm
watching it back and I noticed at the
style vo I'm all energetic and excited
and then at the end of the video I'm all
sad because technically we did fail we
couldn't get the 8700 which is I'm sure
a lot of people want to know the max
potential of the b-series motherboards
and so we couldn't actually test that
100% here today and so I guess I got a
little bit down about that and but
regardless we've got the use price
performance coming very soon I am gonna
get that cleaning tutorial done that's
like the next promise even though it's
not really a broken promise kind of only
promise that a couple of weeks ago but
that will be coming very soon and some
builds as well so stay tuned and I'll
catch you another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
