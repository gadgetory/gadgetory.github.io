big coolers well for the actual card
itself I don't think it gets much
crazier than this this is the r-tx 2060
ROG Strix and they've pretty much put a
20 atti sized cooler on something that
would be considered a mid-range graphics
card I mean this thing right here is
bigger than a Radeon 7 which is AMD's
best card at the moment but of course
the Radeon 7 out performs the r-tx 2060
so what were as OOOs going for when they
design this card well today we're gonna
be running this thing through all the
tests and paces that you would expect
from a graphics card review except we're
gonna be changing things to make it a
gravis card review as you guys all know
and love around tech yes city but
kicking things straight off with this
card you've got a dual v bar switch
which changes between quiet mode and
also performance mode a little box that
comes to defaulted to performance mode
which will give you fan speeds of 50
percent and that will allow the card to
go up with normalized clock speeds to
around 2 gigahertz switching this over
to cue mode does drop the fan speeds
down roughly 10 percent and also raises
the temperatures about 6 degrees over
that out of the box and also drops the
clock speeds down roughly 30 megahertz
overclocking the card will bring you
extra performance however in this case
when I did lock in a stable overclock it
did fail with the auto fan speeds of 50
percent I had to raise them as a 60
percent to get things stable so if you
do want to overclock be prepared to
manually set in some fan speeds to get a
tangible benefit over that of the
out-of-the-box settings but speaking of
the performance numbers in cue mode P
mode and the overclock mode I'll pull up
one graph for you guys and then we're
gonna forget about quiet mode well we
can see it's falling just a slight bit
behind the performance mode but the
noise differential isn't that big so if
you're going to get this card I just
recommend leaving it on the default mode
out of the box and not really changing
anything at all if you're gonna
overclock it definitely set the fan
speeds to 60 percent the Q mode itself
although it is there I'd really only
consider turning it on if you really are
that sensitive to noise but with that
said let's take this monstrous 1.2 75
kilogram card and compare it against
other cards in the fray and see how it
stacks up
so with all the gaming benchmarks
finished it does paint a picture of a
thousand words but we will go over those
thousand words for you guys because it
is important to note that this card does
carry a premium over your standard r-tx
twenty sixty cards and in the US it's
about sixty US dollars in Australia it's
actually around a hundred and forty
ozzie dollars so if anything you are
getting a lot better value for money for
the r-tx twenty sixty Strix rog in
America versus Australia I'd say that
140 AUD premium is starting to push it a
little bit if anything I'd like to see
that come down in Australia but without
aside the 60 USD extra it's actually
pretty well justified considering the
build quality of this card is phenomenal
the out-of-the-box performance settings
are really good too coming close to that
of a manual overclock on the Galax RTX
2060 and coming quite close to an RT x
2070 though keep in mind I did not
overclock the RT X 2070 that was out of
the box settings but it still was a
little bit ahead if anything I'd like to
think of this card as sort of performing
like an RT X 26 TT I if that was the way
to explain it that seems to be where
it's slotting in somewhere in between a
standard RT X 2060 and an RT X 27 T
they're going through the numbers a
little bit more in depth we can see that
in Apex legends this card is coming
quite close to an RT X 27 T the Radeon
17 when the 1660 ti although it's
getting lower numbers you will see a
trend running through all these
benchmarks and that's what the 1% in
point one percent lows are the closest
I've ever seen to the average FPS in any
of the benchmarks I've done here on the
channel and this was a consistent trend
that I noticed because I just did these
fresh benchmarks yesterday so I was able
to analyze them and then stack things up
and say hey 1660 Ti isn't doing too bad
but moving over now to Far Cry new dawn
a new game in the stack here we tested
with minimum and also average fps and
this title was doing very well for the
ROG Strix card coming ahead of that of
the galaxy by quite a bit and also
coming close to the art
x27 t radeon 7n pulling out quite a head
may be able to dirt rally true this does
look like it's an nvidia favored title
CRT x 2070 actually scored a victory
over the Radeon seven in this particular
title and still coming ahead of the RT X
2060 though the 2060 ROG Strix still
coming out of the galaxy X 2060 and then
the 1660 ti following that trend of
having those very consistent 1% and 0.1%
lows and movie go to Crysis 3 you guys
loved it when I tested this game
recently and honestly I'm gonna keep
testing this game I think it's just a
staple running over the years and how
demanding it actually is and look at the
numbers it's following that buck trend
that we saw in the first two titles
Radeon seven out in front 20 70 then
2060 ROG then a standard 20 60 then a 16
60 TI and then the last game we had up
here was strange Brigade where this was
looking like it was slightly favored
towards AMD then the Nvidia cards but on
that note the ROG Strix did perform very
well coming close to that when it was
overclocked - and r-tx
2070 where the numbers were showing that
this title is favored towards AMD
graphics cards over Nvidia cards but the
ROG Strix is doing very well slightly
more towards the RT X 2070 than that of
the 1660 compared to other titles so
great performance out of this card so
there you guys pretty much have it with
the ROG Strix RT x 2060 now some other
things that they do include on this card
is another button besides your V bias
which and this is to turn the LEDs on
and off instantly you can also use the
software to change the RGB to different
color schemes I personally like the
music and temperature which were special
effects though will critique one thing
that is I would have liked to have seen
more choices in terms of your RGB
software in that they only had six
choices two of those being these special
effects that I mentioned before looking
at the inputs and outputs of the rear
you get two HDMI and also to DisplayPort
outs totaling four display out options
which can power four monitors at the
same time the card also requires six
plus eight pin PCIe connectors and comes
in with dimensions of 300 millimetres
long by 134 millimeters wide and has a
depth of that of a two and a half slot
cooler and features 319 mil fans so Zeus
have used a custom PCB on this card and
it is just like any other
ROG Strix product and that is build
quality's good over clocks are good
temperatures are good noise is good and
it does have a premium over your
standard MSRP entry-level cards of that
same Kalibak and you do get the RGB
lighting on the front and rear of the
card where the logo on the back plate
itself will light up so basically in
closing my thoughts with the r-tx 2060
Strix is if you are in the u.s. that $60
USD price tag isn't looking too bad
considering how beast of a card this is
if you're in Australia the 140 L Z
dollar price tag increase over your
standard r-tx 2060s is a little bit too
much I'd like to see a Zeus drop that if
that's some feedback for them then I
could definitely recommend it more so
than those to the people in the US so to
sum things up for you guys the ROG Strix
card is an absolute beast it does use
slightly more power than its competing
r-tx 2060s that come in and MSRP but
that's because it is aggressively
clocked out of the box I feel like a
card like this is definitely suited
towards someone who doesn't really want
to overclock but wants great performance
out of the box and you just pretty much
slot it in the build and you're going to
be getting a really good gaming
experience so they've done a phenomenal
job though keep in mind it does use a
little bit more power and does cost a
bit more than your standard MSRP r-tx
2060s but on that note they've done a
good job hope you enjoyed this review if
you did and be sure to hit that like
button and hopefully I answered all
those questions about this card right
here if I didn't or you just want some
tech yes lovin and be sure to drop a
comma in the comment section below and
I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon he's out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
