you just coming back to you guys today
with a vlog sorry it's been a while
since i've loaded a video i have got the
norovirus and it is horrible they should
call the horror Oh virus because it's
horrible you know I had to call in sick
to work for two days to get over that
and the worst thing was my wife came
down at the exact same time as I did so
we were both sick and we couldn't really
do anything and help each other that
much cuz we'll both you know doing it
tough and the worst thing was little big
got it before we did and he still got
diarrhea one week on so yeah I lost
three kilo three kilograms in one night
I vomited and diaried that much that I
lost so much weight but anyway let's
leave out the gory details you know we
went to the doctor three times for
little B and only once for me and megumi
once each so I'm talking about guys
going to the doctor in Japan today I'm
going to talk about that in my vlog but
before that guys I want to and you may
notice like a new microphone here this
is my new microphone due to review on it
goes it is awesome it may not sound as
good a because this is the YouTube video
webcam record thing and I noticed the
sound quality wouldn't be as good as
here recording in a program like
Premiere Pro for instance it's got the
real high audio codec in there but
anyway guys I'm sure it'll be fine to
hear me out and I'm sure it's crystal
clear I'm sure there's not much noise at
all so hopefully there isn't any way
yeah this it didn't sent me back too
much anyway but before I go I need your
input these two back walls here they are
going to get two posters on them and one
of them is non-negotiable the other is i
want you i want i need your input which
one should go up there guys so let me
choose let me let me choose ok ok i mean
let you go I'm gonna let you guys choose
ok so this is Exhibit A guys is this
going to get one the dark knight rises
is that going to get a slot guys so
let's have a look at that one more time
the dark knight rises I thought it was
an epic movie so I had to get the poster
for is that going to get one of the
slots or here
Exhibit B V for Vendetta is that going
to get the other slot I mean is that
going to get the slot guys so let me
know guys V for Vendetta i love this
movie too i thought it was awesome so is
Christian Bale getting it or is Natalie
Portman getting the slot I don't know I
need your input guys and obviously the
last one that is non-negotiable this
here guys this is non-negotiable bobba
fett that is getting a slot man that is
just I mean awesome that is epic I mean
that is definitely getting a slot so you
guys probably will agree that stole was
is just awesome I would swear but you
know I'm not really in a swearing mood
guys so let me know is that the dark
knight rises or is it V for Vendetta
which one is getting the other sort of
wall space there so we're going to make
dinner for Christmas I'm gonna have a
bit of holidays and I want to decorate
my room a little bit you know and give
you guys better vlogs you know give you
guys better quality videos and that's
what my main goal is to keep improving
especially since you guys are supporting
me and I'm at 700 subs which is awesome
thanks thanks a lot guys and of course
let's get on with the vlog I so
basically I animate as quick as possible
and basically I've talked about health
care in Japan and it can be expensive
and there's different options you can
choose and basically if you want me to
talk about that again I can just let me
know that those are going to the
hospital and Japan goes things to look
out for a big thing to look out for is
to watch out and stay clear of the real
big hospitals okay only go to them if
you absolutely need to okay the reason
is because there's so many old people
that I went to this it's called Naruto
buin it's Naruto hospital buin means
hospital in Japanese and it's just down
the road probably about five minute trip
by car and now this hospital it took us
about five hours yes that's right five
hours from when we got there to see the
doctor and you know we we were weird you
know the night perform man I'd lost
three kilograms vomiting diarrhea was
continually you know
still continuing that next day I felt so
bad I'd wait at a hospital for five
hours with these symptoms it's like you
know damn man that I'm never going there
again but anyway when you go to Japan
guys if you're going to go to a big
Hospital I mean please go there as a
last resort I mean I've never had to
wait this long at a hospital in my life
so I mean I feel sorry for people who
have to wait hospitals for such a long
time I really I do sympathize with you
now I know how I know your pain okay so
badly it's horrible so anyway guys we
ended up going to the hospital waiting
we ended up talking to the nurse about
two hours after waiting and she's like
well we'll we'll call you so we ended up
coming home eating lunch and she called
us we went back an hour later and we
still had to wait another two hours so
you know we were pretty angry and you
know as you would be if you got you know
vomiting and diarrhea if you're waiting
in hospitals there anyway that's the
thing we noticed was just so many old
people at this hospital and you just you
know the queue times people they come to
the hospital and they don't they don't
want to really care about their symptoms
they just want to talk to the doctor
like literally like a friend of friend
conversation and it's horrible this is
this is at the moment in Japan this is a
big problem and people don't the news is
starting to talk about a bit more but
people don't really care and they just
you know hold the hospital cues up
because they want to talk to the doctor
about you know they might have had a
scratch on their neck or something and
they're worried it you know and they
just go on and on and ask all these
things about to the doctor and it's just
like well there's other people who are
you know pretty damn sick who really
need to see the doctor and get meds and
that was you know us so you know we were
kind of yeah basically in a nutshell
guys when you go to the big hospitals
try and avoid them if you see a lot of
old people there yeah you're going to be
in for a tough wait so to avoid that
guys are going to talk it as the next
thing I was going to talk about is go to
these small hospitals I've never had a
problem in Japan all the hospitals they
generally cost about the same i actually
found the big hospital was a little bit
more expensive and the quality of care
was less so in other words you know it's
not as good value as a small hospital
the small Hospital which
literally a two minute walk down the
road they were closed so we had no
choice but to go to this big hospital
because it was a Thursday and for some
reason you know practically all the
small hospitals in Japan are closed on a
Thursday or a Sunday so it's really
weird but anyway guys we ended up yeah
regretting that and so we got to that
hospital and it was a horrible but yeah
the small hospitals guys you only
generally wait about 10 minutes 20
minutes it's really quick and you know
for instance the actual doctors bill
itself is really cheap I mean we all
came out as a family we took little be
there too he was in the children it's a
completely different section we're
actually did him and like how that I
think he took about an hour and we did
that while we're waiting for us to get
processed so yeah the the whole family
we cost together about a hundred dollars
including meds and doctors visits and
stuff so the small-time a small Hospital
would have been about the same and it
would have been 20 minutes so you know
if you go to Japan and you know the
small hospitals are a lot faster they're
a lot more efficient as well so a lot of
the small hospitals around my area and
I'm in the country guys they've even got
like the digitized waiting numbers and
they'll tell you roughly how long you're
going to have to wait in the queue and
stuff and you know then they give you
your meds and you meant to pretty cheap
too so you know I actually broke my leg
22 years ago and it only cost me seventy
dollars including meds brace crutches
and all that so health care is pretty
cheap over here guys I never you know
haven't had a problem i think the actual
care itself is really good as well the
doctors do really care and they do
really you know they're concerned about
you I but you know all in all guys I'd
prefer the small hospitals to the big
hospitals any time you know any day of
the week if they're open so that's the
thing but anyway guys I hope you enjoyed
this vlog and you know obviously please
let me know which poster I should be
putting up and let me know guys if
you've gotten your request or any videos
you want to see please let me know guys

a chance with my giveaway guys i'm
