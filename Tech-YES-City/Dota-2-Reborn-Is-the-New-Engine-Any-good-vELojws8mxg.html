in the MOBA scene and that is dota 2
reborn so essentially it's a new engine
and has a new UI so today I'm going to
give you guys my thoughts and opinions
especially on the engine so let's take a
look
ladies and gentlemen welcome back to
tech yes City this is brian coming back
to you guys today with my initial
thoughts and opinions on dota 2 reborn
and now essentially what this is is just
it's going to be a game that or it's
going to be dota 2 reborn like literally
in that it's going to overtake dota 2
once they've finished touching it up and
finish putting the final touches in
though for what it's worth i'm going to
say straight away that i do like the new
engine the main thing that I like about
it is the smoothness of the gameplay for
some reason this just feels like a 60
FPS it's bada smooth like for some
reason it almost felt like i was playing
120 hertz it reminded me of playing
games on 120 hertz monitor i don't know
how they're doing that because why not
analyzed a few frames there was no
motion blur being put in being
implemented into this game so they've
obviously reduced CPU overhead and as
you can see the textures actually looks
like will actually look a little bit
better so they're focused more on making
this a little bit more GPU intensive and
less CPU intensive which is always a
good thing so straight away i'm going to
say with the engine it's better than the
original dota 2 so dota 2 reborn does
carry a better engine and it is going to
be a more enjoyable experience if you
play dota 2 already and with that being
said it's it's great that they're doing
this if what it's worth if you came in
thinking you'd be a whole new game than
you're mistaken as you can see here it's
pretty much plays exactly the same the
game's identical to dota 2 it's just
dota 2 with this new improved more
efficient engine rather than having a
whole new look to it so the game feels
exactly the same you're just getting
better pick textures and you're
obviously getting a more smoother engine
so straight away i'm going to give a big
thumbs up to this end you know the fact
that they just brought it out of nowhere
like I didn't even know where this
announcement was coming from and I just
download the beta and I started playing
it and I was immediately impressed with
how smooth this engine was so that's the
first point I'd like to talk about and
the second point I'm going to talk about
is the new UI where it's kind of a
little bit different and straightaway
the smoothness of the engine carries
through to the UI like the UI feels
really smooth as well looking through it
it looks very detailed it looks better
than the old you I though I will point
out one thing and that's that I wish the
actual you know party menus and find a
ranked match I wish they would make that
a lot bigger and sort of make that the
main focus because I just enjoy playing
the 5v5 for what it's worth so I'd like
to see them sort of keep retain the old
party menu and find you know a ranked
match where you choose your servers and
stuff I think that works really well
already and dota 2 so I kind of see no
need to change that so the next big
thing to address is the custom games
that they're introducing with dota 2
reborn now I like that they're doing
this because this is pretty much paying
homage to the original way that dota
spawned in itself and that was from user
map settings on warcraft 3 so they're
allowing different kind of custom games
to be introduced different playing
styles so things that you're not used to
for instance something different to your
5 verse 5 and you can try some different
games out there's actually a lot of
different custom games and a lot of
these can be made from the community so
it's really the good that they're
implementing this I personally haven't
tried any yet and I will get into trying
different modes out and possibly if you
guys want to see a video on what custom
games are like then I could definitely
upload that for you after trying a few
out though what it's worth there's
already a ton of custom games out there
at the moment and I'm looking forward to
trying a few of them probably the most
popular ones so this is a really good
feature that they've implemented and I
really do like it so the next thing I
wanted to talk about is the sort of I
guess some of the things that people
will be wondering like why isn't there
new graphics essentially they did state
a new engine so that's kind of different
to new graphics but honestly myself I
would have loved to have seen improved
graphics me having a high end gaming PC
I certainly will higher higher end
graphics settings are always welcome
though I can understand with dota 2 it's
made to pretty much play on any computer
and I definitely think with this upgrade
that they've done to the already
existing dota 2 engine it will be able
to be played on pretty much any computer
whilst offering some slight graphical
improvements so I
do like what they've done with that and
I can understand that they don't want to
change something that's already
successful so lastly I wanted to talk
about the innovation aspect and this is
where I like what they've done here
because this kind of forces other mobile
arm creators to get more innovative and
i'm mainly looking at Riot Games here
which I think need to release an update
for League of Legends because I can
personally see ray games losing League
of Legends player base to dota 2 since
dota 2 are constantly getting involved
with things like this update and so I
like what they've done here and I think
it's a great thing not only for dota 2
fans but for the MOBA seen in general so
big thumbs up there and I'd like to see
some other movies I mean we've got
heroes of the storm in open beta now so
that's going to be an interesting thing
I actually want to play that and get
into it and give you guys a review of
that but for what it's worth dota 2
reborn is a welcome improvement I do
like what they've done with it it is
really butter smooth you can probably
see this is only at 30 frames per second
you probably like wall this is actually
pretty smooth in itself so anyway guys
that's about it though if you have any

reborn then be sure to drop a comment in

back to you as soon as I can and if you
