a name for themselves with releasing
some really nice cases headsets keyboard
and mice and today we have an
improvement on 2017 s keyboards and this
is the pure E Series which comes in a 10
keyless form and also 104 size keyboard
now of course that big question remains
is this the right cougar for you well in
today's video I'm gonna help answer that
for you welcome back to tech yes it is
brand coming to you guys today with a
look at two different keyboards from
cougar they're puri and also their
period TKO now the puri it comes in at
75 USD or if you're in Australia 95 AUD
nullity KL version comes in at 70 USD
and also 89 AUD so it's a little bit
cheaper of course you get those 10 keys
cut off all the numpad cut off and it
makes it a little bit smaller now I do
like the Tikal over the full-size
keyboard and that's a little bit more on
that later but what you're getting for
the money is actually a pretty good deal
this keyboard comes packed with legit
Cherry MX switches now you do get the
choice of picking either blue or red and
for this review they sent me out the
blue switches which is what I requested
on the big fan of the blue switches in
the Cherry MX field line of switches
they have two levels of feedback they do
make a bit of noise but they really feel
nice to type on and if you guys want to
know the differences between blue and
red switches or any other switches for
that matter then I'll put a link in the
description below for you guys but as
soon as you open the box you're greeted
with a keyboard with a hard cover of
plastic on board and now this isn't just
looks for ascetics or sort of an
unboxing experience is actually a
protective cover that attaches to the
keyboard via magnets and now the
keyboard itself even though it's a hard
plastic design and on that note is very
sturdy and pretty lightweight for a
mechanical keyboard it has mechanical
metal screws on the keyboard itself on
the outsides this allows this cover to
attach to the keyboard and when you're
traveling you now have an additional
layer of protection on your keyboard
itself and this is why I like the tkl
it's not only smaller but it's lighter
itself coming in at 1 kilo without the
cover and also eleven hundred and
seventy grams with the cover on as
opposed to the full sized keyboard
that's fourteen hundred and fifty grams
with the cover on and 1,250
grams with the cover off and another
cool thing with this keyboard is it
comes with a modular cable that's a one
point eight metre braided cable that can
attach to the keyboard by the via the
center right or left or if you're a
little bit janky enough you can put a
hole in your desk and have no wires
showing at all so you kind of get that
Wireless look if need be but also more
on the build quality itself it's a very
rigid keyboard I was shocked at how
strong this keyboard was I couldn't bend
it no matter how hard I tried I mean
there's very little flex in the actual
keyboard itself and then typing on this
thing this is where things got even
better it does have a metal backplate
and upon typing on this keyboard I got
one of the highest scores I've got ever
that's 137 words per minute and of
course the noise was pretty controlled
for a blue switch out of all the blue
switches out there I'll let you guys
have a quick listen
so the typing experience on this
keyboard was very nice to say the least
though one thing you don't get is a
wrist rest included though that's sort
of a trend that's coming in with
keyboards nowadays personally I like to
buy my own like latex nice soft keyboard
rest that I use between different
keyboards and honestly I would highly
recommend you guys get one there's so
much better than those hard plastic
wrist rests that come with a lot of
keyboards the on top of that note of
build quality flex and rigidity the
actual key presses themselves had very
little movement in them too when pressed
down and also when idle as well when
you're not pressing down in their keys
there was very little movement too so
this is not only a good thing for people
who want a consistent typing experience
but it's also a great thing for gamers
who have their fingers sitting early
above the keys and they're ready to
press those keys down at a heartbeat
notice with games like csgo or dota 2
for example so the build quality was
good and the typing experience was good
now the key caps themselves I believe
they're ABS plastic I mean usually they
are ABS plastic because if they are pbt
then you'll see a big thing on the box
saying PB t because PB T's generally
accepted as a better quality of material
to use on your keycaps and is more
expensive so it is ABS plastic from what
I can tell does have a little bit of
flex in it in the actual keycap
themselves
but what about a big important question
with this keyboard that's the
backlighting so find the b-roll you've
probably just seen white LED
backlighting and that's unfortunately
all this keyboard has both the tikal and
the normal puri have just standard white
LED backlighting now you can adjust this
via three levels of brightness you've
got off level one level two and then
level three you can also change the
different patterns and also individually
backlight different keys themselves and
save them to the hardware profile the
keyboard unfortunately there is no
software support from cougar themselves
with the period just yet
so you can't make things like macros
from Cougars own software now of course
you can circumnavigate that by using a
third-party software to program some
macros if need be
the one good thing is that even the
tikal itself has media keys via the
function you also get the media keys on
the full-size keyboard above the numpad
so now its conclusion time for the
Cougar and their brand new puri and puri
Tikal keyboards what do I think would I
recommend them and I'm gonna say this is
sort of a weird recommendation because I
like the Tikal that's the Tang keyless
design the small loan comes with that
hard protective cover I think this is
gonna be a great solution for people who
want a travel style keyboard want to
have a really good at typing experience
on the road don't want that keyboard
getting damaged one thing that's very
consistent good timing experience so for
70 USD with legit Cherry MX switches
it's actually pretty good value and of
course for Aussies that 89 AUD pricing
is really good too though of course what
about the actual bigger size keyboard
the normal period this is kind of where
I think this is entering a hard market I
mean of course you do get the legit
Cherry MX switches and I do like the
clean aesthetic I mean a lot of people
are gonna love to clean aesthetic both
on the actual font and the keyboard
itself and the matte black design but I
think they should have implemented RGB
especially on this model even if it
costs an extra five to ten dollars that
way you can color coordinate the
keyboard to your whole build for
instance if you want black and red you
can then change the lighting to red and
if you now go to black and red keyboard
green and black or blue and black and
the list goes on and also with that on
the full-size keyboard especially I
would have liked to have seen some macro
keys on the left and possibly even some
software to support those macro
as my main daily driver keyboard the
blaster X has RGB and also has on the
left-hand side five macro keys which I
can easily program and they don't get in
the way of any operations though with
that aside it does come in both the
period in the tikal and a really good
price point it is a very solid keyboard
especially for typing and it is hitting
hard in terms of value for money so
Kouga have done a good job on their Puri
lineup of keyboards and of course
everything is Hardware controlled and
the cable management is pretty good too
and of course with that aside I hope you
guys enjoyed today's review if you did
then be sure to hit that like button and
let me know in the comments section
below have you tried a cougar keyboard
before if not why not if so would you
like to try one which keyboard would you
like to try or of course if you like
those good old Cougars then let me know
which kind of Cougar you like and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
