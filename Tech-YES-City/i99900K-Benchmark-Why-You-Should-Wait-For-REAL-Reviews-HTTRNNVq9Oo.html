doing what I do around the studio here
that's getting deals doing videos
cutting new builds whether it be
potatoes or brand-new computers and then
this news story pops up and it was set
loose via Steve over at hardware unboxed
and then after that followed up by the
tech Jesus himself Steve from a games
Nexus and they made some really good
points I where I'm boxed even took it a
step further and put the benchmarks that
that posted on the principle
technologies commissioned benchmarks
against their own benchmarks and found
these numbers to be seriously misleading
and this is why I'm making the video
here today because these benchmarks only
aren't just misleading they differ from
what we would expect out of companies
from the guess the pre-release
benchmarks the numbers that they're used
to posting up now when Nvidia or AMD and
Intel usually have these pre-release
benchmarks they kind of show their CPUs
in the best possible light in other
words they cherry pick some benchmarks
where their products will be running
better than the competitors but the
biggest problem this time around is that
the competitors product and that's AMD
and mainly the 2700 X because this is
going to be the main competitor to the
99 hundred K this CPU has been seriously
hemorrhaged and debilitated in these
benchmarks and it is disgusting when you
look at it really
and apparently Intel commissioned these
benchmarks to a company called principal
technologies and in this case I think
Intel or to decommission these
benchmarks straight away and that's
because they're misleading and the
average person that goes up and looks up
some 9900 k benchmarks on Google might
go then and see these benchmarks and be
like oh I better get one of these
because I'm going to get 50% extra
performance in games when we know that
as reviewers this is completely false
most people with a 1080 GI and even the
RT X 2018 28 G eyes are going to be
playing to higher resolutions whether it
be 144 Hertz 1440p or 4k and you're
going to see sometimes as little as like
a 2 or 3% difference and they cut the 8
core 16 threaded $300 CPU in half and I
feel like the 2700 X is currently AMD's
it's the best value proposition but it's
their best gaming CPU - and I'm looking
through these benchmarks there's a total
of 19 of them conducted that were then
posted by a website called PC gamers n
where they then put them in graph form
and you can see in some of these
benchmarks there was a big difference
between the 2700 X and the 9900 K and
also if you look closely you'll see that
the 9900 K is also sometimes beating out
the 8700 K and the 808 6 K which
shouldn't be happening and so we go back
to this original paper we start doing
some more in-depth reading and we see
that the settings are just all over the
place
for starters on the 9900 K they're using
the Z 390 and they haven't really
disabled anything then you move over to
the 8700 K that disabled multi-core
enhancements so they're making sure
these run at lower clocks than the 9900
K this is within Intel's own CPU lineup
and then we move over down to the 2700 X
and again everything's been disabled and
then we move over to the memory timings
which is so important for AMD CPUs
especially when it comes to benchmarking
video games
AMD's Verizon CPUs love a combination of
higher memory speeds as well as lower
latencies as I was a bit surprised to
see here that they just locked in a lazy
manual 29 33 megahertz without changing
the timings at all and then they went to
Intel side and they enabled the X and P
profiles essentially dropping the
latency down on the memory and then
capping that to 26 66 megahertz as if to
say hey we gave AMD an advantage here
guys when in fact they actually gave
Intel another advantage on memory speeds
- because Intel if you guys didn't know
it actually likes lower latencies for
gaming more so than higher speeds on the
memory AMD on the other hand especially
with Rison it likes as we just said
before a combination of higher speeds
and lower latencies you couple them
together you're going to get better fps
to a certain point and moving through
these benchmarks at least the ones that
show the biggest discrepancies at least
from what I know and testing some of
these games and what we're seeing here
ashes the singularity this game uses up
- pretty much a maximum of 16 threads
and isn't it ironic that the 9900 K has
Steen threats past that you'll see the
core utilization really drop off in this
game and it's not that good of an
optimized game it's actually it got
inherent input lag in the game itself
and I've tested this in the past and
hence why I've dropped it from my
benchmark suite of games but here's
where we saw the biggest difference
between the risin 5 1400 and the 9900
Kay
moving through some more of these
benchmarks we could see big
discrepancies in four night pop G Far
Cry 5 Civ 6 Rainbow six siege and rise
of the Tomb Raider and now the biggest
telltale sign is that these benchmarks
should not be taken seriously is when we
look at the 2700 X numbers also compared
to the 2950 X and the 2990 W X I've
tested all these three CPUs in the past
and the 2700 X does the best for gaming
out of AMD CPUs so I was really
surprised to see it losing to even its
Big Brother counterparts which have more
cores and threads in a more suited to
streaming and also productivity but then
we also take things back on these
benchmarks and we look at for instance
Rainbow six siege versus pop G with
their own numbers with the 808 6 K
versus the 8700 K and we see that it's
just inconsistencies within their own
benchmarks themselves which just makes
me really scratch my head as a reviewer
who actually does proper benchmarking
and test things apples to apples because
I don't believe these CPUs were even
tested apples to apples but wait the
ridiculousness the ridiculousness
is it but wait the ridiculousness
doesn't stop there if we look at the way
they've tested these games they've used
the in-game benchmarks whenever they
could but then they've also used fraps
and just reported average FPS numbers
there's no point 1 and 1% lows which are
arguably way more important in a CPU
test for gaming than they offer a
graphics card I'm absolutely fine with
people using average and minimum fps for
GPU benchmarks but when it comes to CPU
benchmarks at high frame rates we want
to know if the CPU stuttering so other
variables with that CPU and combination
of testing can be identified as maybe
flawed or whatnot and so what we're
seeing is average numbers across fraps
and in game benchmarks and that's
from games Nexus pointed out to they're
only using a median benchmark in other
words they're only just picking one
benchmark out of the who knows how many
runs they did they could have just run
these benchmarks once for all we know
they're just that inconsistent but now
here's where things get more frustrating
for me as a reviewer I'm under NDA so I
can't refute these claims until the 19th
of October this month but I want to send
an open message to Intel and that is
please decommission these benchmarks
because they're just not accurate
they're not even cherry-picked
benchmarks which is kind of as I said in
the intro expected of major companies
like yourself Nvidia and AMD everyone
knows you do it but when you're
hemorrhaging the competitors products
it's just not fair and it's misleading
to consumers other than the average guy
could search up numbers for the 9900 K
come across these benchmarks in these
fancy graphs and think wow I'm
performing 50% better in games but then
when you go to the bottom of the page
there's a freaking disclaimer to say hey
we don't take any accountability for
these inconsistent benchmarks so the end
of the day is someone who takes pride in
my benchmarking in the way I present
numbers to you guys I just find this so
misleading and I mean we're all guilty
of making mistakes
when I make a mistake I'll tell you guys
if it's a big enough mistake that I feel
it could mislead people I'll take my
video down any guys that's about it for
today I hope you enjoyed this video if
you did and be sure to hit that like
button but also let us know in the
comment section below what you think
about this whole 9900 Kay Commission
benchmarks I just think it's it's not
right I mean until don't have to do this
I mean I'm sure the 99 hundred K is
going to be a solid product they're
bringing back soldiering to between the
IHS and the die so it feels like they're
listening to the consumers and and
reviewers like myself who have critiqued
them in the past for these things but
then they go and Commission these things
and put out a statement saying that this
data is consistent with what they're
getting in their own labs I really don't
know what was going on with that reply
either I mean seriously just
decommission these benchmarks we'll get
you guys out some solid numbers day one
that you can actually rely on and make a
solid purchasing decision
when it comes to the 9900 kay but anyway
when it comes to opinions I'm sure
everyone has one and I'm for you guys to
reserve yours until the product is
released and we can see real numbers
from trusted sources anyway I'll catch
it in another tech video very soon peace
out for now they trusted sources like
this new merch right here you got to get
some tear gas City retro shirts baby
