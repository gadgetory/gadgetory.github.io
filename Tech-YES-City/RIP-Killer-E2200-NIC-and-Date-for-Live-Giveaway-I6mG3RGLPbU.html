coming back to you guys so there was
some sad and good news first off the sad
news my killer eight 2200 ni si is
officially dead
so it was born on the 4th of June 2013
and it died on the 16th of October so
the official cause of death was
lightning now you can see there the
light is permanently on even though
there's no cable even connected so this
thing is just bricked and it's funny
enough everything in my house after this
lightning storm is like this crazy
lightning storm came through two blew
this massive bolt of lightning through
the power lines everything in my house
is fine because it's all protected by
power surge connect protectors but
finding enough just the N I see
everything on my motherboard works fine
as well so just the N I see the blue out
which is really weird
I believe the killing blow was dealt
through the actual internet line itself
so it's weird and often the power surge
must have came through the modem passed
through the modem passed through the
router and then killed the ni C so if
anything it kind of sort of points
towards maybe you know even though the e
2200 works well it's probably got some
cheap components in there like really
cheap components anyway I don't know the
full story but it's dead I've ordered an
another ni C that's coming it's gonna
replace it and in the meantime I'm using
this wireless adapter anyway let's get
on with the good news the good news is
that the live will be happening on the
22nd of October at 2:00 p.m. Australian
Eastern Standard Time now I'll put in
some other time in the description below
on all the major parts of the world I
still gotta figure out what time that is
