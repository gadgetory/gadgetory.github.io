design define r6 which is their latest
case that will be released in January
8th next year in 2018 though with that
you guys are probably wondering is this
case worth your money and of course does
it live up to the hype well let's do a
full build and find out welcome back to
check yes City and here it is the r6 is
hitting it at 130 USD or 150 with the
tempered glass side panel now scope tech
did provide this case for review they're
an Australian retailer down under here
and it's coming in at 209 of strain
dollars or 239 AUD with the tempered
glass fitted out now you can get this
case in four different colors the old
black which everything's just black
you've got a standard black which some
of the key features will be in white and
then you've got the gunmetal which is
the sample that I was sent in and then
of course you've got the old white model
too so four different flavors for your
liking but with that fractal design
promised a clean aesthetic and also
something that's really easy to build in
and of course nothing that's going to
annoy you or anything that feels cheap
in this build so with that when I
started building in this case it did
live up to that name fractal design
usually make very clean cases now the
previous experience I had with one of
these cases was the r4 and if I remember
correctly that case was a little bit
heavier than the r6 so they have
lightened it up a bit which is great for
me since I'm moving cases around a lot
and with that it also still has that
same strong build quality
now with this case you get the ability
to install eight drives from the get-go
two SSDs on the rear of the case and
also an additional six either 3.5 or 2.5
inch drives with the included drive bays
now there are extra slots so I could
believe you could mount an extra five
drives on top of the eight drives if you
wish to so that's a total of 13 drives
that could fit inside this case there's
also a nexus Smart Hub up the top and
with the top panel you get the power
button 2 USB 3 ports and also your
headphone and audio out jacks and with
that you cannot grade that to fractal
designs modular system a USB type-c
that's 30 USD so they do give you
options to make this whole case modular
and inside the case you can vertically
mount a GPU 2 with their flex VR c25 kit
that's an
additional 40 USD as well so they
haven't included these things in to drop
the price initially though there are
those options there for people who want
to add extra and speaking of modular
this is where the r6 really shines you
can take the side panels off in sort of
like a modular like fashion remove the
screws and then they click off and on
that's both the rear and the front
tempered glass side panel and inside you
can actually remove all those drive bays
if you wish to install an extended ATX
motherboard or you wish to have extra
water cooling options with a 360 mil
right at the front or a 360 mil route on
the top now with those drive bays
included you can only get a 240 ml rad
on and also the corsair h 115 for
example which is a 280 mm rad with a
thicker length won't actually fit with
some heat sinks i did run into a problem
with this x 299 extreme for motherboard
though i do imagine someone going in
with a case this big they would want to
put in a motherboard with preferably a
very emits ink on board now you're
probably thinking VRMs and temperatures
though before we get onto VRMs the top
panel itself and this is does tie in
directly with temperatures you can
detach that by clicking a button and
then it'll come off and with that you
can take off the actual closed base
which has sound deadening on and then
speaking of sound ending you get sound
anything on the rear panel and the front
panel and even the side panel if you get
the non tempered glass version will be
sound dead and - if you remove this then
you'll then have an open-air dust
filtered panel which you can install
back on the case and this will allow the
temperatures to breathe out the top and
also if you install a radiator like I've
done here at 240ml rad that'll allow the
fans to just blow the air out the top
also with that I did install the deep
cool 240 gam ax cooler and it does a
fine job of cooling a 7900 X so I have
put a lot of parts in this at 1080 Ti
7900 XC probably wondering how did these
temperatures hold up when when I started
playing games that were really good in
pub deals getting 65 degrees on an
overclocked 1080 TI now this is in a 24
degree ambient environment when I took
the timber glass side panel off it did
drop down to around about 63 degrees on
the same spot after a couple of minutes
so and especially when you're putting on
a tempered glass side panel which glass
itself is an insulator you are reducing
the amount of airflow that can get into
the case and now with
we are using a 1080 TI that does have an
aftermarket cooler and that's
essentially just dumping hot air into
the case so it was good to see that the
fractal design define r6 with the tube
front included fans and the rear fan did
an absolutely fine job of keeping this
case cool and also quiet and at the
moment I've even got this machine
running beside me and it's just really
whisper quiet now you're probably
wondering I've just been talking up the
r6 at the moment to this point
everything seems perfect and honestly
when it comes down to it this case
really is close to perfect as you'll get
I mean for a midsize ATX case it has a
nice size everything worked when I
installed things cable management was
absolutely fine the included grommets
the big rubber grommets they didn't fall
off they were very stiff they did a
great job of covering up cables that
were going through the rear spot of the
case and the front side of the case and
with that the dust filters on the bottom
front and top they all removed with ease
everything came off detached and then
reattached with ease to the screws came
into the holes very easy there was no
cross threaded screws everything was
firm no sharp edges as well so if you're
a diabetic and you're cutting yourself
you're gonna have a fine time in the r6
that means you're not gonna cut yourself
at all with this case because nothing's
sharp so everything's a smooth finish
very clean aesthetic and with that
having tried the r4 in the past I can
say without a doubt that I prefer the r6
by a long shot this case is as close to
perfection as you're gonna get of course
I did come into that problem with that
corset extra thick cooler not fitting
but of course this is a fractal design
case they're not going to design their
cases for Corsair coolers that was the
only problem I really had in this case
but besides that everything was great
the weight balance also the materials
used it's a very strong aluminium
brushed finish and also without the r4
when we compare that to the r6 I thought
the r4 was way too heavy I thought the
metal they used was just too thick and
almost got a hernia using that thing but
I'm happy to report with the r6 I'm not
gonna get that hernia carrying this
thing around also on the bottom of the
case is an enclosed power supply shroud
running all the way across so even if
you've got ketchup and mustard cables
this case will hide that and also on the
rear of the case you can access that Paz
place so easy you just take off the
module
racket there put your power supply on
and then you can reinstall it and it's
great if you've got a modular power
supply itself and you need to get the
cables in you can then sort of move the
power supply out a little bit quickly
and then put the cables on and then move
the power supply back in and some
last-minute things before I get on out
of here on the rear of the case there is
a seven fan hub as well so you plug that
into your motherboard give us some
solder power feed and then you can plug
in seven additional fans this is all on
the rear of the case the cable
management as I said before was really
easy to work with this velcro straps
included there's also zip ties included
though one thing I did notice if I
remember correctly with the r4 was there
was some easy labels on the actual
plastic sleeves for the screws
themselves so they did take that away
though there is the manual that is
really easy to read I'd like to see
those labels returned especially if a
beginner is getting into PC building
they're going to want to know which is
their SSD screws and their hard drive
screws and their motherboard mouth
screws but besides that with the r6 it
really is a case that is worthy of your
money it does hit all the marks that I
would want from a case personally it's
got that clean aesthetic going on that
will suit both people in the
professional industry but also
enthusiasts who just want a subtle and
nothing too in-your-face look of course
you can see the hardware as well with
that tempered glass side panel I do
prefer the tempered glass look over the
standard look as well especially with
this day and age we've got a lot of our
G being the case on your parts and a lot
of lighting it does look very clean and
I didn't really use any custom parts
here it was just a pretty
straightforward build didn't take that
long at all with this case and it was
very quiet - I know guys if you enjoyed
this video then be sure to hit that like
button and let me know in the comment
section below what you think of the
define r6 is it gonna be your next case
or do you want to build on it if so why
if not why not love reading your
thoughts and opinions as always and with
that big thanks to scope tech for
sending this out for review they're an
Australian retailer you can pre-order it
from their site from the 8th of January
you'll get it in and delivered to your
door you can go pick it up from the
store and it's coming in again 209 AUD
or 239 are you
with a temp of gloss and I'll catch you
guys in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
