needs good memory speeds in order to
perform better but by just how much does
it perform better with higher speed
memory and also in the current pricing
of the ddr4 market is it worth it to get
that highest speed memory let's find out
welcome back to tokyo city this brand
coming to you guys today with a video on
ddr4 memory and rising cpus now a lot of
other people have tested memory speeds
on rosen and shown that it does indeed
make a performance difference but also
today i'm going to be testing different
speeds but as well within those speeds
tests different timings to see how
performs in games however before we get
on with the benchmarks we have to talk
about the specs and the speeds that
we're testing at first of all we're
using the horizon 3 1200 which is the
slowest variant up in the Rison lineup
of cpus now the reason I'm using this
CPU is it's going to be the most
sensitive to memory speed performance
upgrades if you indeed use that in video
games also we're using a GTX 1080 with
1080p on low settings so we don't want
any graphics card bottlenecks affecting
performance to see these differences now
with that said we overclocked to rise
and three CPU to 4 gigahertz and we're
also testing three different speeds on
Crucial Ballistix memory which I find
the X and V profiles work perfectly at
3200 megahertz however the other speeds
that we're testing out is also 2666 mega
and 2133 mecca's however within those 26
66 megahertz speeds I'm also lowering
the timings as tight as possible to see
if that makes a difference versus the
speeds themselves so the first benchmark
we're looking at here is Far Cry primal
and 1080p low settings 117 FPS at 32
hundred megahertz contrast that to 2066
with low timings we scored 114 fps and
then 2666 with a little bit loose of
timing scored 113 fps and then of course
default memory speeds of 20 133
megahertz scored 106 fps so what we saw
here going from 21 33 to 2666 made quite
a big difference however 2666
low timings and even loose timings
scored only three percent lower than
said
200 megahertz when it comes to csgo one
of the most popular multiplayer titles
we're using a community-made benchmark
map so the results will be very
consistent what we saw here with 3200
megadose is around 329 average FPS when
we go to 2666 tight timings we had 295
average FPS and then loose timings yet
again scored 295 average FPS however
2133 was well below the ball here
scoring 273 fps so there was quite a big
difference 20% between the lowest memory
speeds and 3200 megahertz however 26:56
even the type timings was quite a bit
behind by about 11 percent next I'll be
have dota 2 which will incorporate a
little bit of variance however I do try
to weed this out as much as possible by
going storm spirit mid every time in a
bot match and what we saw here was that
2656 was only 2 percent behind 183
frames per second versus 187 on 3200
megahertz even the loose timings on 2656
got 182 average FPS and then 21 33
megahertz scored abysmally low with a 12
percent difference at 168 average FPS
versus the 3200 negatives at 187 fps
then moving on to Tom at Clancy's the
division very accurate benchmark I find
it spits out the same numbers almost
every single time your benchmark is
thirty-two hundred megahertz 186 fps
then going to 2666 tight timing 185 and
2666 was loose timings 183 and of course
21 33 megahertz scored in quite
substantially lower at a hundred and
seventy four fps so on this particular
game the big difference here with 2133
was falling behind by quite a lot then
of course the last game I wanted to test
for you guys was players unknowns
battlegrounds or pub G now I go into the
ruins section of the map every time I
benchmark because I get consistent
results generally people aren't there as
well so it's very easy to benchmark and
what we saw at 3200 Megadeth's was 141
average FPS
type timings we got on 2666 Megadeth's
135 FPS loose timings 133 and of
cause 2133 yet again fell below at 122
average FPS so it was 15% behind 3200
megahertz as opposed to 20 666 which was
only four and six percent behind
respectively however another thing to
point out too was the minimums were much
better at thirty-two hundred megahertz
than all the other settings and of
course this is a benchmark that does
have the most variants out of any
benchmark I've ever done in the past of
course it's a multi player benchmark but
also I've found in pub G spikes are
generally dependent on the server so
really in this case I would kind of have
to ignore the minimum fps as the game
isn't that well optimized as well as it
does depend on the server performance so
what can we take out of these benchmarks
well 3200 mega Hertz does indeed perform
the best across the board in every
single game I tested also the tight
timings versus the loose timing there
wasn't that much of a difference at all
so in fact we can see that Rison does
indeed love higher memory speeds as
opposed to tight timings which I know on
the Intel platform the type timings
generally tend to make a bigger
difference as opposed to the actual
memory speeds themselves so basically if
you're on Rison you will want the
highest memory speeds possible however
this now brings us to another dilemma
and that of course is ddr4 memory
pricing generally when you buy a memory
the faster the memory is the more it
costs and as of making this video I have
never seen ddr4 prices as high as they
are in the history of doing tech so this
further complicates things as whether
you should buy the highest speed memory
or the cheaper less expensive memory and
just pocket that money and honestly
after looking at the memory prices at
the current state I would say it's not
that much of a premium if you're getting
a 16 gigabyte kit especially if you're
going with a rising 5 or a rising 7 the
Crucial Ballistix I managed to find a 32
hundred megahertz kit for around about a
hundred and forty five dollars which
isn't too bad at that price considering
the cheapest ddr4 memory 16gb bike kit I
could find was 115 dollars that was only
a $30 premium and of course the
performance gains can be substantial
considering that Crucial Ballistix stick
works out of the box with XMP profiles
with the team memory you'll generally
get that to 2666
at least every single kit of ddr4 memory
I've had comes through here has managed
to work on Rison at 2666 though this
trend does seem to continue down to the
eighth gigabyte kits as well so the
cheapest to buy for gigabyte kit I could
find within the $60 range as opposed to
the cheapest 32 hundred megahertz kid I
could find that was in the $80 range so
it was a $20 premium for the highest
speeds and of course would I recommend
that as opposed to the cheaper kit and
honestly at these prices I probably
would I'd say go for it a $20 premium
isn't that much considering the whole
build cost will be over $500 if you're
building a new rising system and a gtx
1060 or are x57 or even a 1050 Ti so it
really is worth it in my opinion if you
want to overclock
and also on that note those thirty two
hundred megahertz kids generally tend to
work out of the box you just lock in
that profile restart your computer and
you're good to go as opposed to a
cheaper 20 400 megahertz kit which will
generally need a bit of clocking and it
may even cause you some headaches in the
process so with a set of ddr4 prices
somehow miraculously come down and the
cheapest ddr4 memory versus the
overclocked memory does make a bigger
price gap then you have to read that
question of is it worth it and really it
comes down to the performance figures
you've seen here today honestly at 2666
megahertz
the experience is really smooth even on
a Rison 3 1200 so really if you get your
memory up to 2666 megahertz which I've
got an overclocking tutorial which I'll
put up here somewhere for you guys it's
really easy to do and the performance
gains are quite substantial over 20 133
megahertz
anyways I hope you enjoyed today's video
and if you didn't be sure to hit that
like button and also in the realm of
ddr4 memory there is the samsung b die
memory which is meant to be the best in
terms of overclocking and also in
general working with pricing correctly
and getting those highest speeds however
of course as with anything in this world
you get what you pay for so generally
the more expensive the memory the better
it's going to be you guys I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon these
now for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
