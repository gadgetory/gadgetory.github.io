and welcome back to Joon's episode of
hot used matters and deals for PC
hunters and joined by a nerd on a budget
how you doing hey I'm doing good Brian i
thanks for having me on again hey what's
up everyone and so basically what this
show is about is looking at the deals in
the month looking at sort of like what's
the best play if you're especially if
you're a deal hunter and you want to
build a gaming pc for your friends or
someone or even if you want to flip that
PC what sort of like in fashion sort of
thing because one thing that's happened
with these deals lately right one thing
that's happened with the PC models
talking to a few friends the other day
we're in a very unique day and age right
now because if you went back say 10
years ago and you tried to buy parts
that were 5 years so for instance you go
back to 2008 and yeah you were trying to
buy parts for 2003 that was sort of
relevant oh yeah for sure but now we
come to 2018 parts from 2013 are still
so relevant so what we've got here is it
such a unique market where it's really
just yeah it gives rise to use PC parts
flippin I guess and so we'll take a look
at some of the deals we got here today
Danny and I both bring in some deals to
the table first one being I guess the
hybrid gtx 980ti is a really good deal
oh yeah do you want to take it take the
lead on this one
yeah it wasn't a story real quick since
all the deals I asked for the stories
from the viewers and this was actually a
prequel story so that's why I wanted to
talk about it
but let me scroll through what was the
person's name again I had his name is
Benjamin V Benjamin B okay alright so we
have a 1988 hybrid from Benjamin B he's
from Houston actually Houston Texas and
I saw it we do have some people from
Texas in the chat right now so he's in
your neck of the woods but he picked
this up for $300 which I mean given the
state of graphics cars right now
especially with like GT x10 70s still
pretty overpriced this is an awesome
deal and what happened was he actually
meant to buy this for a friend
and because it's friend eater graphics
card so he bought it for 300 bucks on
Craigslist but then his friend ended up
finding a better open box deal for 270
micro centers so he ended up keeping
this graphics card and what he was able
to do was he sold his r9 390 for 315
bucks
so he made a profit off of it and he
switches 390 to this 98 epi and that
card is just beautiful I mean it's
gorgeous yeah it's it's actually
performs really well to the hybrid
cooler really does a good job of cooling
this thing down I've tried a 980ti with
a water cooler before even the 120 mil
solutions they do a great job of giving
you better overclock - so that's a
pretty good play that's a nice play when
you getting a 980 I it's still so
relevant even in 2018 even sort of like
getting branching into that high-end
gaming we have picked up yeah we'll talk
about when we get to the nine 70s but
we're gonna up here next up is a Camden
and this is really weird because I
looked at the photos it looks like
there's two different shots here he's
got a GTX 670 and he's also got what
looks like yeah I'm asleep so he
actually picked up two graphics cards
here one of them was an Asus GTX 670
it's a 2 gigabyte variant he picked up
one for his friend and then for one for
himself but he got both of them for $40
each on let go which geez let go there
over there in Australia I don't know not
sure what exactly is metal yes it
definitely is it I would say a new meta
I've used it before - so it's actually
I'm not sure if it's a part of the
Facebook app but there's other kind of
Craigslist alternatives that are popping
up like offer up Macari have you heard
of those ones no I mean in Japan my
friends telling me about some auction
one that was pretty good to get some
deals on but it's try it's just do this
is Gumtree and yeah basic marketplace as
well is pretty hard there - there's our
- sort of places you go to online you've
also got forums as well there's the OCA
you forum I mean I tried signing up a
few like I think last year I tried
signing up I apparently had to weigh
like two months or something to get I
couldn't be bothered you think wait I
try to do the same thing here in the US
- like there's a
OCP as well as some other forums and
because it's like so tight-knit there
they want you to be vested for a while
so you have to have that kind of like an
active account you have to be posting so
yeah I found those are hard but what
this let go and these other apps are
popping up I think they some of them
they can be standalone or they're just
part of the Facebook like interface kind
of like Facebook market babe place
always yes it's just another place for
people who don't really trust Craigslist
to post their stuff and I've picked up
stuff on there well really when you
think about it when you when you look at
this and you look at a site like let go
you look at a site like Gumtree or
Facebook for example yeah you've got
that whole anyone can access it and
people who want to offload stuff instead
of chopping and in the rubbish bin or
the garbage when they instead sell it
for dirt cheap and that's when you're
gonna get the real deal that's when
you're gonna get that super good deal
now a lot of people yeah we just let
stuff go I mean I've picked up a heap of
different deals over the last couple of
months in my used deals hunts some
extraordinary goods I think I mean the
GTX 980 I picked up for 250 AUD was
really good I was happy with that deal
now I got a 9 HDI before that first 350
AUD so that'd be like you know 280 and
180 USD respectively it's pretty cheap
and so those cards are really high-end
you can put them in systems and they
perform better than you know for
instance a 1066 gigabyte system and a
1070 system in a lot of cases so yes I'm
really good I mean they're easy to get
apps are definitely where the deals are
at and I'm I'm gonna pull up next year I
think Caesar Caesar oh my god these are
oh okay yeah $250 now for a gtx 750ti
and i-5 4670 k so i guess ii i guess he
hustled it down $100 from the 350 dollar
entry point yeah that's what a lot of
these people are doing when they show me
the ads they actually they're kind of
I'm not sure we call it low balling but
they're offering less and so I mean yeah
that's that's not a lowball it's it's
getting close to it but a low gapping is
like half price and even on dog 250
solid it's a decent offer on 350
especially considering the specs aren't
that gorgeous on this thing I mean it's
a 70 50 that's the only thing that I saw
those holding it back like if they I
think if the guy slapped in the stronger
graphic
scarred to kind of pair better with that
I five he could have sold it for maybe
450 or 500 as like a complete gaming PC
you know I'm putting for tonight in the
title and just kind of sell it to some
kiddies
yeah but I mean I flipped a PSA early
today for 350
it's a full night PC you know just
putting together some PC parts you know
that that's fortnight's sells gaming pcs
at the moment especially for low-end and
especially even if you want a couple in
for instance like a monitor and a
keyboard and mouse combo and a headset
you want to go that far you can make a
whole gaming package and especially on
the low end it really does help you sell
your builds but of course it's picking
up the monitors that's why I'm not going
out of my way when I deal hunt to go get
the monitors yeah but if they're there
and they're cheap enough i just i
stockpile them because they will help
sell those lower and builds if you can
add okay you pay an extra 60 70 dollars
I'll throw in a monitor keyboard mouse
bank suddenly that package looks so much
more attractive especially for someone
who doesn't get into PC gaming they
don't know what they're doing if you
give a comparable figures for instance
if it's got a 78 17 you like hey this
performs close to a gtx 1050 people
gonna think wow I can get this package
for half the price
so yeah the PC that you actually just
went to sell is that gonna be in a video
or is that kind of just like an offline
type thing name is doing I don't know if
I already featured it I'm not too sure
I'm gonna donate a heap of PCs very soon
though okay do have a lot of peace like
I got a lot of donated parts and it's
like for me it's like I'm gonna make a
mass video where I'm just really make a
heap of different pcs and then don't and
for a local cause okay I should be
shipping off like you know stranded all
of PC it cost like $300 of ship a PC in
distress so yeah yeah and so I will be
doing giveaway for the viewers that also
want to do something for like low income
families you know oh yes I'm gonna do
something mags I get them donated Heba
pause I wanna make make give back and I
think what I like about this build
before we move on is the power supply is
really nice the case is really nice SSD
and hard drive he's got a gigabytes of
RAM all's it really has to do is update
the graphics card and he's got him so
he's got a cool master cooler already on
this thing and he gives himself a really
nice gaming PC I'd slap the GTX 1060 if
you could find one or
974 like 200 or less yeah this is like
under $500 really capable PC yep
that's it next up we're gonna move on
now to a clutch kick Rover II I think
this one C this is a really cool play
because he's got a Z on in here now this
is my favorite of the whole bunch yeah I
need a on he got me interested and a lot
of the viewers too this was actually two
deals and the first one it was just a
gtx 770 the guy was asking for a hundred
bucks but then he said he offered 60 and
he took it which i think is a steal of a
deal even I believe does it say in there
if it's a 2 gigabyte one either way I
think 60 bucks USD for a sense 770
because it's gonna give pretty similar
performance to a 1050 TI those are still
really overpriced over here in the
states I mean like their prices came
down slightly but now there's like
around 150 so this is a great
alternative for something I had to drop
the image down on the right because
there was an address there like oh yes
if people are sending I gotta say - if
people are sending us your deals and
stuff make sure all the sensitive
informations out guys please just like
saying I was gonna blur it out I didn't
get a chance to yeah also this guy has
blocked him as well as there a reason he
says he's blocked
Eli Hernandez ah yeah I'm not sure
actually I did not catch that you so ha
did he like just run away with the goods
and then be like y'all blah I wanted
maybe the guy wanted like the things
back after how much is worth so that was
the GTX 770 right now the system Lizzie
on in it was it was a different seller
that was selling it so what happened was
the guy listed it as a dell XPS with an
i7 in it and he he offered him the
asking price but then when he showed up
the guy pulled out it was actually a
precision T 1600 system and it wasn't
what he advertised at all so then he
said okay that's not what you're
advertised so I'll give you 15 for it
and then the guy said okay sure but then
when he gets home he opens it up he
finds out it has a Xeon e3 1270 in it
you know 2.4 gigahertz 4 count 8 threads
I have a gigabytes of ddr3 RAM and
my hard drive and there was no problems
with it so he made off with a $15.00
full bill PC that he maybe just needs an
upgrade the power supply and the
graphics card and you got a solid system
there that's a really solid system yeah
so if you can utilize those Zeon's
that's probably where the best players
with the server's live if you're gonna
go for those X Server systems those
locked Zeon's that are comparable to i7
2670 770's for example they're a really
good play especially if people don't
know what they're worth and you can
basically with that you can then really
make a mint because a lot of those pcs
will be getting sold out at the moment
so you can have those cheap Zeon's and
where you go you'll be ballin especially
when you get a GTX 770 as well and a
seven he's nothing to laugh at it'll
still perform exactly like it was at
1050 TI if not a little bit better
before get your bikes I think yeah it's
about the same it depends on the titles
from with the benchmarks that I've seen
by up and someone can point out look at
that hard I was gonna point that out as
well look at that hard drive tray I mean
what happened there did someone just
like oh oh the ham oh oh yeah okay so in
the story says he had to modify the t
1600 hard drive cage this stuff to 770
in it I'm not sure what oh that's how
you do it that's exactly how you do it
around tech yes city
just a quick dirty bang job and he's
gaming now yeah I mean you can get that
you can take the drives out you can do
the whole to get the Dremel out and
start grinding away it's up to you
me personally I'd yeah I like the jewels
personally man you know you get the just
a little bit of Rage out rip the hard
drive cage out and you're good to go we
got up here next to his Josh B and he's
he's looks like you got a dealer sort of
it's it's a good it's actually good met
I like this one because he's sort of
picking up those newish parts
yeah and he's getting four really good
prices it looks like he got an i7 6600
yeah yeah so 6600 K
and also a 1/2 terabyte hard drive how
much memory is there there's 8 gigabytes
of duty a 16 gigabyte whoa fury HyperX
ddr4 20 400 megahertz yeah and x10 70
yep the wind force dual fan overclocking
okay that really does make the deal
worth I mean a six thing you bytes of
ddr4 is expensive nothing to fret at if
you are looking to build a PC at the
moment ddr4 is probably your biggest
enemy I mean there's you grab Scott's
coming out from max miners they going
down pretty cheap new graphics cards are
coming down a lot in prices it's just
the ddr4 is probably the biggest enemy
at the moment stopping you
so what yeah with that in mind if you
can get deals like that you essentially
just wait out the ddr4 and you can
probably sell everything else and just
keep the ddr4 and go free 16 gigabytes
out of that deal oh yeah sure that's
what I like about that so that's
definitely a nice and I was talking
about that before when I picked up a PC
a few others was it last year even
possible I forgot when I did it I picked
up PC with 32 gigabytes of ddr4 in it
and it was like I got it really cheap
the whole deal it just had a bad I'm not
a bad graphics card I was 7970 and I
picked up the whole thing for 800 strain
is really a deal that's a good meta to
follow if you look at new parts and you
see who's letting things go yeah there
is a I mean there was a PC flipper on
the Gold Coast who picked up a rise in
PC for like 500 I think I offered 400
but someone else was really quick and
they offered more so obviously the guy
who sold it to the girlfriend more but
yeah I want to get them deals next up
here we got a nick C 83 56 thinking
about two ddr3 for a hundred and thirty
that's a USD yeah yep yes d okay so
that's not a bit I mean the sixteen
gigabytes is solid the 8350 if you're
not going with to higher in the graphics
card if you're going with a 770 or
something you're gonna have a good time
like you really got a decent solid deal
here I mean it's got the cooler included
it's nothing super the motherboard looks
real mediocre oh yeah definitely
lowering motherboard but I just broke it
down doing the math that 16 gigabytes of
ddr3 RAM is worth roughly like 70 to 80
so that puts the motherboard and CPU
combo at around $50 or so which I mean I
know it's old and people like to give
epic series a lot of crap but you're
looking at you know building a system
like sub $300 here so I think in that
price range you're gonna get enough for
1080p gaming you slap a decent graphics
card in there nothing to I end I mean
I've used the 8350 it's okay of course
nothing great but you still be out of
place you'll still be able to play games
on this thing that's the bottom line
especially if we can get a grab a cheap
power supply now grab a cheap gravis
card and a cheap case you get himself a
really cheap gaming PC so kind of like
that I like that play I mean I always
just keep a lookout remember deal's a
deal doesn't know what it is except if
it's a pentium d then you're in trouble
that's not exactly a date deal anyway so
we got here next up or rich at 2600 K
$100.00 combo and oh yeah yeah when
you're talking about 2600 K in a hundred
bucks you've got one epic combo not just
a combo so that looks like a lowball I
mean the guy's selling it for 250 in the
ad and the $100 I mean that's ballsy man
I really he offer 40% of the asking
price but that's less than half by a
good 10% yeah I mean do you think you're
doing fighting do you do that yeah not
only ball that much man unless unless
the person really invites it and they
will in the ad they'll say offer me
anything so I'll be alright let's just
offer you nothing because you're saying
that they're usually most people
especially on the Gold Coast especially
in my area they'll be like price is
slightly negotiable or price is pretty
firm you know you're not really dealing
so you know straight away they want
around that area some people don't even
do any offers as well but yeah yeah like
low balling as well they you do it when
the person gives rise to it in their
language okay offer me anything just
want it gone so some people very put
something off for 200 bucks if they
can't get the 200 they need it gone
urgently they'd probably invite lowballs
yeah I mean I personally that's pretty
that's a pretty ballsy lowball at $2,600
12 gigabytes of RAM - nothing to fret at
it's got a power supply even got did you
even get the LED strip included I don't
believe so
it's the icing on the cake so the case
in the end there so what he did with hee
hee because it came with the
Coolermaster half case which is kind of
getting old by now it's there he's got
food crumbs in it or something yes that
he likes and then it looked like it was
pretty dirty and beat-up maybe that's
why he was comfortable offering so low
but the last picture with the LEDs is he
actually if put into a new case of p300
and it looks like he bought the LEDs
himself but I mean I think that I 720
600 came motherboard alone are worth
roughly about 100 USD if not a little
bit more so he made off with a bunch of
extra stuff from this deal because he's
ever lowball so much oh yeah I think
that gtx 570 is pretty much dated and
that needs to go other than that
everything else is pretty much set up
for a cheap gaming rig 2600 k yeah you
laughing I mean that CPU still so
relevant so yeah well I really like this
deal I'm not too sure I agree with the
low I'm personally a pro I would have
came in a half price but yeah hundred
bucks ngratulations 25 so yeah yeah
that's that's pretty ballsy I mean most
people in ours will tell you you know
what to do if you offer on that and then
another thing you're black like they
won't want to talk to you again as well
that's the riskier on sort of yeah so
you know for me usually I come in like
thirty twenty twenty thirty percent off
just often it just depends on the
language anyway next up we've got
something I'm sorry yeah
oh no I got C well it's because people
like you and I because we do this quite
a bit we don't want our reputations to
get tainted in our local area right but
I mean some of these guys I think
they're just doing this every once in a
while or once every year or two when
they upgrade their PCs so they might be
more ok with it or you know they're not
as worried as we would be yep that's
true that's true so next time people got
some laptops also get a donation as well
cool ah yes Brit the master do you ever
feel awkward when you're low ball and
the seller get had I see yeah that's I
mean I've done in the past I'm not gonna
lie I mean I've done that in the past
I've low-balled pretty low and the
seller hasn't just got mad they were
like you know really mad and you know
just angry like you just really abusive
language and yeah okay yeah so like
I learned kind of you just got to learn
how their their wording their sort of
adds you know it's like and I was like I
said it I have low board in the past
like not too long ago but the person
invited it with the language they're
like you can't offer me anything sort of
thing all right where we go so yeah and
then yeah so next up here we got the HP
laptop I don't know how to sort of it's
a beats laptop I'm not too sure on here
so I left up dismal exactly an older
laptop but so this is from stalefish
and he actually said he picked it up for
50 bucks on Craigslist he was actually a
late night posting and this one came up
and then he saw it instantly and because
I'm so cheap he grabbed it right away
but this isn't a powerful graphics by
any means it's by now it's actually kind
of dated but it does have an AMD a8 apu
in it so it does have some you know form
of integrated graphics that is you can
kind of I've seen benchmarks with this I
actually looked it up before the show
you can play games like League of
Legends and someone was playing Diablo 3
with this so very light gaming but the
thing is is $50 like you can set this in
front your TV and it becomes your media
PC for your TV or you can just use this
especially if you're like a student or
something I think it's definitely worth
more than what he got it for right now
on eBay they're selling for around 200
to 250 so he got it for a severe
discount
he got a pretty 20% of the price exactly
right I mean it looks like he's got a
touchscreen as well which I'm really
diggin like if you need something just
sitting on the couch or something
touchscreen can sort of help out a lot
yeah especially it's got a webcam
included you needed a little Skype just
good box exactly not a bad little deal I
mean laptops eyes usually don't look at
laptops cuz if they've got problems
besides a hard driver and SSD it's just
too too troublesome and tears but there
is a lot of money and we're gonna pull
out this next deal because this is
really relevant with laptops and flippin
laptops books I know there's a lot of
guys out there who will flip and
MacBooks I'm not into it personally but
I'm guessing it's very profitable we go
there's $20 a twenty dollar MacBook yeah
Trevor B do you want to explain a little
bit more about this because this looks
like it's an ultimate load
oh yeah well no this wasn't a lowball
actually so I actually have the whole
story right here in front of me so so
this is from Travis be from Canada
Ontario and what happened was because if
you look at the messages you can see
that I was originally he'd messaged the
guy for an xbox controller for his son
but then what happened was they kept
talking and then the guy said hey I got
some other stuff the are you interested
and he said you know I have this broken
MacBook Pro and an Apple Mouse and you
can have it for $20 too if you want it
so what he did was he ended up getting
it for 20 bucks which is what you see in
the pictures and when he got home he
just googled it and how to troubleshoot
it and he's ever getting it up and
running with the only problem was that
the power button didn't work but he
would need to replace the keyboard for
that but either way that's gonna be a
cheap fix and then you get I believe it
was a 2012 MacBook Pro which man it's
crazy how even a MacBook Pro that old
still retains its value that's
definitely worth more than 20 bucks yeah
I personally like I would've just
ignored it like I have no interest in
picking this up and trying to like flip
it and fix it look like if you came
across this would you try to pick it up
and try to flip it or like for me the
mom just saw time time is a thing that I
need more of if yeah if people out there
into PC flipping and they're not doing
4k video editing work every single day
of their life they might want to look
into mac flip macbook flipping because I
guarantee you the user base would that
would be selling them I mean I'm not
trying to stereotype but hey why is well
wouldn't be as switched on as someone
building enthusiast tech PCs so they
would just let them go as soon as a
little problem happens it's out of
warranty oh this thing is useless sell
it and it's probably an easy fix and
then you can fix it and reef lip it and
make a ton of profit that's what I'm
guessing is going on with the MacBook
Pros because I do get some people trying
to trade in MacBook someone not
interested laptops not interested and
you know there's just yeah the laptop
game isn't something I want to delve
into cuz in the screws sometimes you can
sit there for days like screwing
everything apart and having to go to
youtube looking at some guide on how do
you say that
dismiss
laptop I got a laptop on troubleshooting
right here this is my family member but
I bought this for them like a year two
ago and it's exactly what you were just
saying like we there's a problem with it
which I don't know what it is right now
so I'm you know doing all the things
like keying out the RAM reinstalling the
OS and stuff but the thing about this
compared to all the other things that we
do you know with desktops is it's not as
easy to change parts out especially if
it comes to like problems with the
motherboard so that's the only risky
part about it because you know it's so
proprietary and they use their own
connectors and things like that
you can't just easily replace that out
so yeah I tend to usually ignore laptops
as well just like you yeah it's it's
just one of those things I'm not
passionate about either like when you
talk about making content as well you
want to be passionate about that content
ya know refurb and potatoes oh yeah I'm
very passionate about that you know
making an old hardware work like new
really passionate about that so there's
a lot of things you know just laptop
cereal isn't my killer fish but I'll
pull up some deals that I've got going
on here all right first one here we've
in the hot used matter inbox we got live
to define he sent this in and Leslie
picked up you know he picked up a little
combo of parts here I think he did do a
little bit of a discount
this is 243 bucks but I think he dropped
in an offer of I was 220 and as an i5
8460 was ddr4 but that wasn't sales or
assault so we got the CPU hard drive and
the power supply and motherboard so that
was a good little combo you know instead
of going out oh yeah yeah so can't buy
it new for 400 bucks you're just saving
a bit of money because someone obviously
probably now wants to go maybe rise in
2700 X or they want to wait for a Z 390
whatever the deal is they're losing
money and I mean when I see an i5 8400
this is one of my favorite CPUs in the
new scene at the moment it is just a
baller of a CPU you've got little to no
heat getting dumped in your case things
like 60 watts of power consumption the
included fans okay for the i-5 it's not
for the 8700 which is a different topic
yeah the price is good it'll work on any
motherboard pretty much in the series
it's a nice power play for gamers and
people who don't want overclock
so it's wait so he got he got the
motherboard - yeah oh dude that's so
sorry because that's 370 even though he
might not be overclocking but because
that I 5 I think it retails right now
for around 180 bucks so that's almost
like you know he almost got that for the
price he paid and then he got all the
extra stuff with it so that's awesome
yeah yeah it is a pretty solid deal I
may not be definitely jumping on that if
I saw that locally so what next deal
here is well from Luis Ramos he's like
dude he sent us two deals in he's gone
hard man he's got so miss like a host
full motherboard yeah mr. Ramos has got
the he's rockin the x58 he knew I'd feed
him on the show as soon as he showed me
this and so $30 and there's like bonanza
so he's got the Quadro in there as well
which isn't really worth looking at it's
an old quad quad Rome ancient now but
x58 motherboard i7 950 and also a EVGA
x58 motherboard the EVGA x58 motherboard
obviously been a big yeah H of this deal
and having six gigabytes of ddr3 is
nothing to fret out if you add another
six gigabytes and you've got 12
gigabytes which is totally relevant for
today's uh for today's gaming pcs so I'm
really diggin that that's a hot deal
from Louis is he in the chatter yeah
alright Louis what's up man I love you
deals I love it we got one more from
Louis he's like look Brian I'm not gonna
stop there he's got a a prebuilt dell
and i think yeah yeah wow so I got this
for 140 went in the middle I'm pretty
sure you got this in the middle and yeah
an i7 6700 like whoa absolute no-brainer
at 140 I mean the CPU Alone's worth yeah
yeah I just chuck out the grams cumin
you got a power supply in there you put
a 1050 Ti in that thing you could
reflect that so easy for over 500 bucks
so you know he's got a solid PC right
here there you don't really have to
change things around so he's definitely
on his game when it comes to getting
those deals and sort of finding those
elusive deal so you know that's that's a
play if you're if you're used PC parts
on it you want to be going for those
elusive deals that people aren't really
looking for like if I go on gumtree at
the moment and
I guarantee you half the Gold Coast is
looking for a GTX 970 or a GTX 980 or a
ddr4 in their search terms there's
someone going with that is is really
good so he saw a c-130 I thought he said
140 an email anyway my bad here would be
he says okay nice that's good that's
good man that's what we like to hear so
we'll pull up some of the next deals I
got him in the email box I said duck
Truong he got a it's an EVGA GTX 970 for
a hundred and five bucks I mean I'm
loving some of these photos as well I
mean you guys taken these photos like
the MacBook Pro photos had some really
gorgeous bakit we use and use your DSLR
like off your phone like Joey dears like
all your phone love to know which thing
is it the Huawei like mine because it
looks like it's got some real nice well
this is from the ad did he send anything
else from from what he took this is
surprisingly good for an ad picture yeah
just he just she just sent us thing so
that's all I saw 105 bucks I mean at
that you just go pay the asking price I
mean I usually don't recommend paying
asking but when something comes up so
cheap you just literally a year on the
doorstep ASAP yeah man I'm paying the
cash I recently picked up a mars 760 and
I offered the guy a little bit more than
he's asking price because I've been
chasing that card for so long now so he
was asking 180 astray and I said look
dude you get a poke he said he's got a
post at Sue's I was like well I offered
him straightaway 200 200 including
postage and he's like yep okay done so
when you know it deals really hot and
it's super hot you can sometimes just
come in and be like yo pay an asking
price you might want to bump it up if
you know there's like 20 other hustles
that are gonna come in on that deal your
deals gonna stand out if you're offering
five bucks more even even than the odds
so yes my way postage so he actually had
to send it to you he was that far away
yeah okay no okay so that's one thing
that I guess we should definitely talk
about because of all these local deals
we gonna pick up its new cash so there's
nothing to worry about right but how do
you how do you deal with you know gum
tree and then for us would be Craigslist
all the other ones if someone was far
enough away and you have to go through
I'm guessing PayPal or venmo or
something wrong hey pal usually yes oh
yeah usually I you got a saucer someone
out with the language like this guy I
called him up I got his phone number
called him up straight away so I'm like
interrogating him a little bit
that's you kind of got to do things
straight away if you know someone's
dodgy man they're gonna try and shy away
they're gonna avoid you and that's just
how it is I mean there was a guy selling
a GTX 1070 locally here about 30 minute
drive away and he wanted to meet someone
like oh my I got my friend to put the
offer in he wanted to meet him in a
shopping center and with no mobile
number or anything
Wow at a random time like that's a hose
warning right there yeah there's sort of
these ways you sift through the batter I
mean I've learnt I speak hose now it's a
language and so if you speak hosing you
can get through it and sort of find out
who's not genuine who's genuine and yet
most people in the scene people who are
watching these videos will not hose
people I know my viewers it's not this
is the dirty practice man it's like it's
really not part of the game you know
yeah anyway okay that's that sort of
like that you know I called him up he
was a really nice guy like okay if you
if I got hosed I'd be shocked
put it that way okay I guess I was just
surprised because for him to go up
because he had to package it up and mail
it out that was extra effort for him
right well I told him I told him just to
chuck it in the stock box and just open
it up and post it in the stock box
oh yeah just save an effort man yeah
like I don't expect him like I just I'm
really interested in the card and a
video with it too so just a different
content but we'll go through some of
these deals and then we can join joint
chat and see what's cracking and chat I
think we got one more deal here now it's
a free pieces Wow free free yes so he
was telling me his neighbor was Matt
Matt's neighbor I think though Matt was
the guy giving it away you know I think
the guy just gave me his email address
didn't say anything just said he ran
across the road saw this PC on the road
and picked it up again and then took it
and it's good I mean you look at you got
a specs at 80 plus power supply and two
echos while it's 500 watt you've got a
thermal right cool
who's like a h 55 motherboard as
apparently had an eye five six six one
in it and a gigabytes of RAM I mean okay
who wouldn't want that I mean that's
absolutely score I mean all you got to
do is go on now Aliexpress if you're
going with a sort of low range gravis
card maybe like a GT if you're going
with maybe seventy eight fifty or
something or what you have to do is grab
it x thirty four thirty four seven bucks
and you're good to go
now you've got yourself a gaming PC for
like next to nothing that will play for
tonight that will play some of it like
dota 2 and csgo and stuff and absolute
phenomenal price performance so free you
can't beat that in terms of price
performance yeah even with all three and
catch-up cables did you see what the
rating was for that power supply would
that be transferable or you think it's
kind of like a low-end like 300 watt or
something and antica one of the makers
who legitimately state their wattage
ratings so that would be good solid they
can be 400 watts on the 12 volt I'm
guessing which is a solid power supply
so they make solid power supplies and
tech they always have Delta you know FSP
these are some of my go-to is when you
look at those power supplies
obviously there's so many dodgy brands
that you've never heard of before you
check the 5ug easiest way guys easiest
way to tell a dodgy power supplies to
look at the 5 volt rail and then look at
the 12 volt rail on the specs if the 5
volt rail has more amperage available
you then just don't even bother using
that in a build it's dodgy or are you
still coming in under your hamper agenda
foul I see it all the time when I'm you
dealing with these potatoes man
I think he's frozen to your webcam Oh am
i can you see me
or can you hear me I can hear you but
you just like a frozen I know
let me undo the thing and bring you back
up you just cut it there yeah yeah yeah
I just but you just became a man before
so I mean yeah and so basically I mean I
had a brain fart what was it just we're
talking about 12 volt and by boat really
yes okay great so yeah if you see the
five volt rail for instance like 22 amps
22 a and then you look at the 12 volt
rail is like 12 a
it's all about that low yahoos I've seen
it I see it yes some of these potatoes
I'm pulling apart and that power supply
just chuck it in the garbage is it's
rubbish so anyway that's so that's what
we're looking at now so we're gonna move
over to chat now I can see chat live as
well okay this time I'm more organized
we've got a new template as well for hot
used metal let me know in the great yes
we got nerd on budget he's uh Danny's
just yeah he's really loving the deals
hunts sort of like and that's why I was
talking with a few friends some people
like to do volume flipping you know
they'll go out and buy like ten
pre-built and then they'll put in
brand-new gravis cards and make a
hundred bucks I've never really been
keen on that I've always been keen on
just getting the deals as cheap as
possible yeah making something that's
really good price performance that's
sort of like when my passion lies about
how about you yourself uh same here
I don't go out and buy tons of stuff at
a time I actually haven't be doing a lot
of crisis deals lately but I've been
buying things on my eBay surprisingly if
you can snipe up the deals right when
they pop up and I only usually build
like one or two systems at a time I know
you usually have a lot more sitting
around right in your but you're doing
this full-time so it's a nightmare
moment dude that's why I I just got so
many pieces and now I'm gonna give a few
away and decent different different
contents gonna be a lot of cool content
coming I've almost finished the backlog
and it looks like there's not a whole
lot new stuff coming in which is great
I've been dying just I've been dying for
a break I've been like please can I have
a break I want to get the sr2 build done
this month the gym video people want to
know about the tales like they don't
want the health video my guys on a
hardware channel but everyone wants the
health video so yeah my just turn it
into tech health city or something so
are you going to bring your camera to
the gym and like I just have videos of
you working out okay yeah now you just
go midnight dude Bonanza oh okay yeah I
don't yeah I just
I wouldn't want dudes like yeah just
feels awkward yeah I do want to show
people like some of the workouts they
can do to sort of combat
sigh yeah and the most important thing
is gonna come out of it sort of like
it's a bit of everything and you stay
you just own the game but yeah I think
that would cool to see because I think a
lot of I mean I'm not sure any other
tech tuber has been focusing on stuff
like that and just given the nature of
computers and us sitting there and like
you said RSI repetitive strain injury
right it's just something that a lot of
people don't really think about and that
just degrades your health over time
slowly as opposed to like like you know
major damage happening from like
twisting something wrong or something so
yeah I think that'd be really useful to
see and you know we gotta make it so
that nerds are fit again and like in
good shape and you know swole because
though we do have a bad reputation for
being kind of like hunchback skinny you
know yeah and all there is so many uh
was a pre conception whatever about yeah
yeah so me Sarah Jobs yeah I mean
sometimes they've they've validated and
warranted but sometimes of course
they're not so I think I honestly think
part of our generation as well came up
like I mean I'll still know a few of my
friends the other day we came up and we
were like you know Friday Saturday were
party Sunday was like StarCraft brood
war and it was like well you mixed you
mix the inert in with the whole social
thing and you just got social nerd and
then I guess now is like the newer
generations coming up they're like the
rise of the the cool geek like it's
actually cool to be a nerd it is yeah
yeah which is kind of bizarre yeah
anyway but if anyone's got any questions
we'll move over to chat a little bit and
maybe even me and Danny might stick it I
mean if Danny wants to debate on my mom
just hit him up on the spot it's too
late oh yeah for sure
I'm Joe Speer like like 1 hour nap
earlier before they go he's good to go
he's pumped that's exciting that so I'm
really pumped as well actually speaking
of the gym I will be going to the gym
late tonight as well so maybe I'll get
some recordings there oh yeah so if you
want super chat you got everything is
the donation thing so oops I'm looking
out don't you have the donate
guys I'm doing pretty well don't worry
lately things have been okay and you
know like don't like with the whole
money thing I talk about money on the
channel that's fine I'm transparent
about it but you know I never want to be
making dirty easy money like I always
feel like I want to grind for my money
have to work for it and speaking to you
know I went to a YouTube thing yesterday
and you know people will win yeah just
in Brisbane it was like this YouTube
convention thing and people just
everyone was there like a lot of people
just whinging about views and money and
I'm like I'm just like man for me it
doesn't like doesn't bother me man like
I've been grinding all my life I
probably will be grinding for the rest
of my life it's a zoo cares yeah that's
the nature of it man like guys like you
and me we sort of that's what we are man
we just we just we keep workin man you
know you just learn to enjoy that learn
to be yeah the dude works hard and earns
his stuff you know the thing about you
talk about money and I was gonna make a
video about yeah I was gonna go through
my creators panel you know and you can
show people exactly how much I've made
so far and just to kind of be real with
them with like how hard it is to be a
youtuber but we're doing it not because
of the money you know this is stuff that
we would probably be doing because it's
our hobby we would do be doing it
regardless it might be step back a
little bit if we had well mine's
definitely step back compared to you
because I have to go work a full-time
job and you know take care of all that
stuff first
but um yeah that's what it's like for me
I I'm not sure if I've told anyone this
especially publicly yet
like I haven't withdrawn a single dollar
from YouTube or Google like you know
like all the money I've made from
Adsense it's still sitting there in the
account you know I've been doing this
funding it by myself and just you know
when I flip a PC make some profit I put
it back in the channel and I'm doing
that because I don't want to have to
depend on the money I know that's
different because I have you know I'm
working a full-time job but I'm trying
to do that for as long as possible just
because I don't want money to ever be
the reason I'm doing any of this you
know it's gotta be like for the fun in
their love of it and just you know
helping other people out so yeah yeah
well I'd love to see that video man
that'd be that's the old video you got
to do people handed me for the video
they're gonna do
on that one so oh yeah we got a question
from Jamie Williams what's the cheapest
GP you've ever bought a decent so oh I
bought he bought it he bought a 984 a
hundred pound okay I think he's sort of
flex in there a little bit that's a
really good deal man a hundred pounds
what is that 2 USD I'm really bad with
the conversion hundred said 130 USD ok
that's that's pretty damn good that's
pretty hard I'm trying to try think the
best deal I've got I mean I mean I've
been given cards right and I'm not gonna
flail I go yeah yeah yeah what's the
best pick-up good I have to think hey
I'd say the 1050 t I feel like I think I
got one for a hundred Australian that
was really hot ok you know I think one
of those ten I've got to 1050 tea eyes
for really cheap and one of them was
it's so cheap I think it was like a
hundred bucks I'm pretty sure off the
top of my head it was close out of that
or 100 110 that was a really hot deal oh
yes super cheap yeah like that was that
was really good that was probably one of
the best of God I have picked up other
deals like I mean ages ago I picked up a
780 that was sort of just had metal
thermal paste and I cleaned it a lot
pickle that really cheap but now that's
that deal back then is not really a good
deal now you know back over two years
ago picked that off like 110 120 USD or
something so there's been some really
hot deals I mean I constantly come into
grabs cards that are solid prices yeah
but the really good prices you know they
come they come here and there so yeah
that's it everyone everyone loves a good
deal and what about you Danny what's
your cheapest grams per Pig it's funny
because my cheapest one is its cheapest
I think buy discount and not actually my
dollar amount because it was actually a
high-end card which is my personal card
which are shown right here it's sitting
in my system it's the if you can oh you
can't even see that but it's a gtx 1070
it's the let's see which version was oh
it's the for the win edition but so this
was I picked this up during like the
peak of the cryptocurrency
you know crisis I guess you can call it
that so I mean 10 70s were being sold
for 400
many bucks and the guy let it go to me
for $200 so I mean I still paid I mean
200 there's a lot but percentage-wise
compared to what I was worth at the time
there's less than 50% you know and it's
is actually the most powerful graphics
card that I personally owned I've never
had a 1080 or 1080i myself or a 7010
semi key I so yeah I'm really curious
with the audience out there the moment
was there anyone out there that coughed
up the money the over did anyone go out
and borrow Christ's 980ti or 90/10 70t
ir a-- tensor did anyone just cough it
up they're like I've got to have this
1080 I'm gonna play this breaking my
game take my 1000 USD for the 10 8 was
there anyone who got ripped off no
because I feel I told you guys last set
everyone just weighed out things will
get better and they did it took a long
time though because remember the prices
started going up last year around like
March timeframe and we've only recently
started seen them come down the last
couple of months right
so that was the whole year like I know
two people who already have their own
systems right they can just sit with
what they have and just coast but a lot
of people are trying to get into the
market and it was that sucks to have to
wait another year when you have nothing
yeah so I can see why this might have a
lot of the gutters like not just held
out held out how that exactly that's
good maybe this gives rise to a new
strat as well because we're talking
about hot used matters we'll do this
last matter and then we'll probably get
on out of here do you think it's a good
idea then to have a little stash a
little safe box with maybe like a gtx
770 in there or something just just in
case you know a tad bit of ddr3 memory
and just just in case things go just vom
be apocalyptic currency mining it
probably all happens at the same time
you open the stash box and you're like
yeah I can still play some PC games here
flip this a PC that was one of the the
things that I was telling a lot of my
viewers and I think a lot of people were
kind of preaching this was basically you
know just get something to hold you over
I'm assuming they don't have anything on
it's like for us it's really easy
because we kind of just have hardware on
hand so if anything happy we can just
grab something like that right but our
selling people just you know grab
something that hasn't
touched by or hasn't been affected which
we're kind of the lower end cards older
generation cards
grab that hold on to it until the prices
come down so yeah that's definitely a
good strategy yeah geez gets 960s as
well I'd say in the u.s. that'd be a
good play if you looked for many gtx 960
s oh yeah I've had a couple while you
can usually find them for around like
seventy to ninety which I think I mean
given their performance you know you're
gonna be at medium to high 1080p that's
that's perfectly fine yeah that's good
the audience is switched on as well like
that love you guys so much
big thanks to Danny for coming out on
the show today he's channels in the link
in the description below he really just
is the deal hunter as well he gets some
really good deals he's always sort of in
