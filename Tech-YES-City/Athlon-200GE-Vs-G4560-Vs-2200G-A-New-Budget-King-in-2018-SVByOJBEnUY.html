here on the desk we've got AMD's new
Athlon 200 GE processor it's too Zen
cause for threads it's locked at 3.2
gigahertz as well but the thing about
this CPU is it comes in at a price point
of fifty five US dollars or in Australia
currently 85 AUD so kind of sits here to
take that throne or at least take that
spot of the Intel's g45 60 which was a
super budget choice back in early 2017
however one thing I will say about the G
45 60 it was released at a time when
ddr4 memory prices were pretty cheap and
graphics cards like our x4 70s and GTX
1063 gigabyte models were very cheap so
you can build yourself a brand new PC
that had such good price performance
nowadays the ddr4 memory is still pretty
expensive but we also have other options
here as well like the Rison 320 200 G
this includes a bigger cooler it also
has a bigger graphics portion of Vega on
board which is eight compute units
versus three on this so if anything this
is sort of like a G 4560 replacement
however what need is there in the market
you're probably wondering well straight
out of the box before we even do any
testing we've got 35 watts TDP on this
little thing here so if anything it
could make for a great office PC CPU but
also on that note it could make for a
great place holder as well if you want
to get on AMD's fantastic motherboard
lineup and for that has in my opinion
great future proofing in that you can
update the BIOS and then step it up to
something like even a 7 nanometre in
2019
so after running various tests on the
200 G Vista Verizon 2,200 G first the G
45 60 we're now a conclusion time which
is a little bit of a weird one because I
knew straight away after at least
running the first game what this CPU was
going to be about and in my opinion it's
about two different things
and that is if you're after a low power
consumption low noise CPU solution
that's actually really good for a budget
orientated user then this CPU is
definitely gonna be for you the power
consumption even when running far cry 5
for example was that 60 watts so that's
full load that's the max you can expect
out of this thing the other person that
this APU would be for would be for
someone who's looking for a placeholder
until they can get say a 2700 X or a
better graphics card because the
graphics card performance of this thing
in titles like dota 2 and csgo and if
that's all you play then this might be
perfect for you it was pretty good 1080p
was playable on low settings on both
these titles and this is the big
difference between this CPU and the g45
60 that wasn't playable at 1080p on low
settings on either of these games to the
point where you have to drop it down to
720p the Athlon 200 GE actually handled
these two titles over 60 FPS with decent
one and point one percent lows and I
could even get some frags in csgo so it
was pretty decent
of course I'm putting the Rison 2200 G
here on the table because I feel like if
you're buying this especially for the
graphics then definitely spend a little
bit extra and go for this you do get a
bigger cooler you do get overclock
ability and higher memory limits the
Athlon 200g is capped at 3.2 gigahertz
and even in the BIOS I was trying to
change the multiplier around that looked
like it locked in I was like damn have I
got some secret success that other
reviewers haven't got and then when I
got into Windows I realized no you
locked it 2667 megahertz on the memory
but you can change the timings to
whatever you want and then on the cpu
for both those cause you locked at 3.2
gigahertz which does extend to four
threads the included cooler did a
phenomenal job of handling this little
CPU keep in mind the TDP is very low and
the
temperatures only went up to 54 degrees
with a decibel level of 23 decibels
it was super quiet and that noise didn't
seem to change at all even if you
stepped it down to idle temperatures
which went down as low as 33 degrees and
the noise stayed the same so listen to
me like this fan is just carrying on at
one speed if it's not then it is really
really quiet but we're not said and done
when it comes to the Athlon 200 GE it's
a real budget orientated choice that I
do feel that if you're just buying it
for the 2 cores and 4 threads then
honestly it's too late I mean that phase
already happened at the start of 2017
with the G 45 60 but if you're getting
something that you want for a low power
consuming off this PC or if you want
something as a placeholder in between
now and getting a 2700 X for example and
a good graphics card then this is
definitely going to be a decent
placeholder for the time being but if
you're going for the 2 cores and 4
threads on its own with just that
graphics on the Vegas 3 graphics with
the 3 compute units then this here is a
much better choice even for the extra
$45 because you're getting 4 cores 4
threads there overclockable and those
numbers will not just come through and
Cinebench it also come through in games
when you're using a better graphics card
and then you've also got a bigger cooler
as well so everything to go for with the
2200 G and even then if you wanted to go
on the intel side of things core i3 8100
as i showed in my previous comparison
and i'll put the link up here if you
want to check that out and to quickly
wrap things up with the Athlon 200g
great little office CPU or a placeholder
cpu but also I did test out some 4k
YouTube videos and this handled it
absolutely fine so I'll probably do 4k
Netflix as well a little bit
disappointed that they've locked down
the overclocking on both the CPU cores
and the memory but I guess thoughts
behind that is they probably want you to
couple it with an a320 and also not over
exceed this little included cooler here
which will get overloaded pretty quickly
if you put more heat out of this CPU
anyway let me know what you think of the
200 G in the comment section below do
you think it's a nice little CPU for the
money or do you think it's too little
too late love reading your thoughts and
opinions
as always no catching another check
video very soon peace out for now bye
but that's about it with the
recommendations nice little CPU but I
think it's coming in a little bit too
late if you're just buying it for the
CPU portion if you're buying it for an
office PC or a placeholder great little
CPU especially for fifty five bucks and
that's when we go to get on with it
I mean maybe there's some other things
amiss so looks to me like this fan is
just going in at one speed and that is
charleshayne I mean if this isn't
shortly wise we'll just give it a little
look I know it's new that doesn't matter
I've got issues man check this out this
is the hospitalist process baby buy it
clean it build it flip it
that's the techie ass process baby check
out a much links in description below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
