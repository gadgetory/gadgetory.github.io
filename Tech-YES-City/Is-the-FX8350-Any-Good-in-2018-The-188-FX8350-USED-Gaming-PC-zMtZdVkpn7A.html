around the channel people have asked
that I take a look from time to time at
the piledriver FX 8350 and the reason
why I didn't take a look is because I
thought it was overpriced at least when
I went to look for deals until yesterday
where I picked up this CPU cooler an FX
8350 and a 970 extreme for motherboard
for around about a hundred and ten
Australian dollars in USD terms that's
eighty five US dollars which in my
opinion is a bargain
for all that combination now some of the
other parts that we picked up here we've
got a GTX 780 this is from EVGA now I
did get this for free but hold on a
moment I know you're probably thinking
oh I got it donated no I actually pulled
this out of a $600 PC that I built in
the past where I replaced it with a gtx
1060 and then up sold that so
essentially i made $15 and got this
graphics card for free and the a
gigabytes of memory i exchanged that for
helping someone overclock their x58
motherboard so i saved them a lot of
hassle a lot of time and they gave us a
gigabytes of ddr3 memory now for the
hard drive we're going with a brand new
1 terabyte from Seagate this comes in at
58 Australian dollars or if here in the
US you can pick these up for around 45
USD possibly even cheaper since we do
pay tax here in Australia and then the
last component is the case this is a
case calm case with a 700 watt power
supply although I have tested this power
supply in the past and it is quite
decent it does have strong amperage on
the 12 volt line got this combination
475 Australian dollars which would be
about 58 dollars in the US of A and that
brings this whole total of the build to
a hundred and eighty-eight USD or if
you're in Australia 243 Australian
dollars so we've already got value for
money sitting here but of course I'm
very curious to see how the FX 8350
holds up in 2018 especially since I've
just tested the Westmere 6 core Z on the
X 50 675 and that did extremely well
I'll put the link for the video up here
if you want to see that but we've got a
one terabyte hard drive I know some
people are gonna say this definitely
blows out the budget but in my
experience at least on the Gold Coast I
can't get good hard drives for cheap the
people selling
use hard drives there literally over
like five to seven years old and at that
stage they're really slow I wouldn't
want to do that when I on sell a
computer to someone it's just a
nightmare when you're trying to boot
something up or get games to load when
the hard drives just that slow so
putting in a new hard drive not only
saves me a lot of time when I'm doing
benchmarks and installing things but it
also saves a potential buyer a lot of
hassle with all that aside these parts
here although they look pretty clean
they could still use a bit of a touch-up
so that's exactly what we're gonna do
we're going to install it in the case
and see how this thing performs
welcome back to take us city and the
first thing we want to do here is take
off all these heat sinks and make sure
the thermal paste is okay even though
I'm not gonna be hosing this down with
brake cleaner because it looks like it
doesn't need it I'm still gonna be
checking the thermal paste or the
thermal pads on all these four different
heat sinks here that's just to make sure
that everything's running okay and same
with the graphics card as well because
if the thermal paste has gotten really
hard and it's crammed up it's not gonna
be doing anywhere near as good as a
fresh layer of paste support apart the
graphs got and the motherboard and the
Northbridge here and the Southbridge
they are really crusty they need a
thermal paste change desperately I don't
even know what's going on here it's like
this brown paste mixed with silver paste
that really doesn't look good and then
the graphics card here has a patch of
thermal paste on it so I'm glad I pulled
all these apart because they could use
some tech yes love and now and then
we'll put it back together
here's the build it is complete and we
had to do some jungle management here
this was really bad there's just
absolutely no cable management options
in this case and because this is a non
modular power supply it's just got
cables everywhere so all things
considered it's a pretty tight case
pretty flimsy but everything is sorted
out and one thing we're going to do with
this case is actually just leave the
side panel off because if we do put it
on its gonna be a sarcophagus in here
like got a GTX 780 FX 8350 and where's
all that heat going to go this little
fan here although I'm sure it can do a
ride is I don't think is equipped enough
to handle the power inside this thing
so now we've got the build it is running
and you're probably wondering what is
this fan doing it's actually cooling the
vrm I've tested this overclocked it a
4.4 gigahertz pretty mild overclock but
this is some of the problems that
piledriver faced the 970 boards
especially the VRMs got way too hot on a
lot of them and they just couldn't
handle the FX 8350 s or even the FX 83
20s so go to cotton bud sticking this to
the case and that's actually keeping the
prm's
just below a hundred degrees without it
will going up to a hundred and twenty
degrees so this is after even just a
five minute stress test so looks like
we're good to go now we should be out of
stress this at 4.4 gigahertz temperature
of the CPUs getting to around about
sixty degrees which i think is okay for
this platform though it is a little bit
hot in here it's 29 degrees at the
moment ambient are a little bit hot
today but we're just gonna finish off
copying some files over I also have run
a Cinebench score and we're getting
close to I think it's 700 points which
is actually not bad for this little
eight core especially for the money I
paid for it
single core performance you guys have
been requesting that got to around about
a hundred points on the single threaded
performance so I'm curious to boot up
some of the same games we're playing
with Westmere X 50 675 and see how it
compares with this but first off we'll
do it with the GTX 780 and then I'll
probably run a comparison for you guys
with the 1080 GI
so just finished testing the rig last
night actually recorded the outro
segment but I woke up this morning and
watched it back and I look so grumpy and
tired I was like no I'm gonna scrap that
rerecord the whole thing and basically
the FX 8350 it is a decent cpu we saw
that in Final Fantasy 15 and also pop G
it can get up and play those titles it
can do it in practically all the titles
we tested here it was a really good
experience not just 60fps but a lot of
times going over a hundred and so it's
not a bad option if you can pick it up
for a good price now some of the
problems of course is the first of all
that 970 chipset I think AMD should have
policed this a lot better and that they
shouldn't have enabled the 8 cores or a
lot of those 9 70s to work with the 8
cores I don't think this board is fit
for 24/7 use with that FX 8350 even a
stock if I go to sell this thing that
I'm probably going to down clock it and
under vault it just to make sure it's
safe I mean look could you imagine I
mean could you imagine that thing in the
background without that vrm fan and also
that side panel closed in the dead heat
of summer yeah you'd have popcorn on
your hands anyway another big point to
talk about too as I just came off the
back of testing that X 56 75 and that
thing absolutely flawed it even against
the 8700 K it was putting up a really
good fight with the GTX 210 atti so if I
was going to do a comparison with the FX
8350 I'm thinking I'll put it up against
maybe the X 30 470 and overclocked them
both maybe to both to 4.4 gigahertz I
think that'd be a pretty fair comparison
perhaps even giving the FX 8350 a little
bit of an edge since it does overclock
higher in absolute numbers then the FX
3470 does better guys the FX 8350 it's a
pretty decent cpu it's not a great CPU
it's not a horrible CPU but I think when
you compare it to something like the x58
CPUs it isn't as good and the FX 58
architecture is older and that's always
been the problem pre reisen now that
rise ins out that's kicking a lot of
tail it's definitely bringing a lot of
competition but if you do want to go
pick up a used FX 8350 system try and
get it with a decent cooler and
definitely try and get it with a 990 FX
motherboard it's got a decent vrm on it
and better specs a lot of those 970
motherboards they're just not fit I mean
if you don't see a vrm heatsink on a 970
motherboard you want to pair with an 8
core just do me a favor and stay away
from that thing automatically but anyway
guys hope you enjoyed today's video if
you did then be sure to slap that like
button let me know in the comments
section below what you think of the FX
8350 a lot of people have been asking me
to build more AMD pre rising systems but
today really shows the reason why yes I
only pedal with a GTX 780 but some of
those games are on very low settings and
the GPU wasn't going anywhere near 100%
so with that we can compare that already
to the FX 56 75 and see that it was for
example in Far Cry primal it was behind
in dota 2 as well it was behind where
the GPU wasn't getting stressed near
100% - but anyway those games still you
got a very enjoyable experience and
that's a big argument with the FX 8350
it will get up in a lot of titles and
play over to 60fps
so of course if you can pick it up for a
bargain and you can couple it with
something like a GTX 780 like I've done
here today then you'll have happy days
anyway guys I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon
peace out for now bye
so now we've pulled apart all these
parts here and it's actually pretty pat
pretty pad saw with that FX 56 75 or X
56 70 set 5 sorry getting this FX
terminology screwed up in my head good
points on the single threaded
performance so I'm curious to boot up
some of the same games we're playing
with the FX so we had a little problem
before with the GTX 780 wasn't booting
up so you're probably wondering I had a
different graphics card in there before
that was just to get everything
installed windows updated all the games
installed and then I was gonna install
this on another computer just to make
sure it wasn't the GPU and it wasn't so
it's working with the capture card now
but that's on the HDMI port so we're
gonna try and change over to the display
port and see if that works but if that
doesn't work then I can still get the
video done in the benchmarking done just
over the HDMI port so it's not a big
deal anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
