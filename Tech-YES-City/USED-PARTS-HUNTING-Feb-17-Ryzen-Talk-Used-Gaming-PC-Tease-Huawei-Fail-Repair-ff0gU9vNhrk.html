this is kind of like the
behind-the-scenes vlog where today I'm
gonna be looking for a used graphics
card for the $100 i7 skylake build that
I want to do next month that was that
engineering sample that I got off
Aliexpress which actually worked on the
z170 Pro you guys wanna know more
information I'll put a link in the
description below but that'll be next
month's bill but also gonna be out lying
this month's bill which I've only got
like a couple of days to do and then
also we're gonna be talking a little bit
about Zen so let's get on with the
motherboard here we're gonna find a
grabs card for it I was kind of like
thinking maybe an rx 390 or a gtx 980 or
even a 92 qi i if they're going cheap
enough so we're gonna take a look on
gumtree see if anyone's selling any of
these gravis cards and I know you guys
love these bogan Cole's so we're gonna
get on with that
so after having a look for a few minutes
we've got up here a few different
graphics cards the first year is an
online 280 I think that's the 7950
equivalent which I mean putting in an
offer of around an $80.00 lowball even
$90 max that would be a pretty decent
deal if I could pick that up we've got
here in abundance of our 9 to 90's and
three 90s here cuz um this is all I can
really find but it's good because this
was kind of after and we've got this one
but $250 I think this has just been
listed as well so I'm gonna drop an
offering of around about a hundred and
sixty dollars hopefully takes that I
mean it's pretty low but this is the
reason why I'm gonna be dropping in
these low offers I mean we've got here
an RX 470 and that's going for you know
150 us because the rebate is actually an
international rebate I mean that's crazy
so we've got here an international
rebate and that's going $20 so you get
it for 150 bucks and you go think it's
like twelve dollars shipping as well so
that's the RX 470 we can just rage quit
if none of these prices are good on
gumtree so we've got here and is selling
tool so we're gonna ask him if you sell
one of them for 160 bucks this 109 398
gigabytes so we're gonna probably drop
in and offer here of 180 dollars I mean
there's a dirt cheap offers but again
with that rx 470 being with benchmark
being you I think it's pretty fair and
then this one r9 390x
maybe $200 for that one so this is
Australian dollars too so it'd be about
25% less in American dollars so now it's
that time to call these guys up and if
you guys have been following the channel
for a while you know that you're just on
this websites called gum tree you just
can't come across as a normal individual
otherwise people just won't want to sell
you the deals and that's why I guess
some of these graphics cards have been
out there for months so if you come
across as a bogan then you will get the
deals or hopefully like at least I've
had a pretty high success rate so let's
give these guys a call
all right so first go no luck
let's try the r9 290 now no one picks up
their phone on a Sunday betting and no
luck again
no luck again guys hey man are you gone
yeah I just saw you out on gumtree yeah
good mate it's an i-9 390x yeah no
worries mate see my boy alright so he's
working today so we're gonna give him a
text on the office so we're gonna drop
in an offer of 180 bucks so let's do
that
so literally only one guy picked up his
phone on a Sunday and we've just dropped
in all the offers there for the grabs
guys so hopefully we get some word back
by tonight if not I'll order in that
graphics card for the build the RX 470
because it's so things around about 200
AUD shipped and I mean that's brand new
and it performs a lot better we're just
a little bit better than a lot of these
cards so I think the r9 390x might be
with the a gigabytes of RAM might be a
better buyer but still that's used so
you shouldn't be paying the same money
used as you I knew so this month's going
to be a different kind of build for you
guys it's going to involve use parts but
a lot of people in the past complain
about not being able to get those deals
that I get so this month's builds gonna
be pretty much a build that everyone can
build but still get that access to that
use price performance and there's pretty
much the deal-breaker here the H 55 a
plus I picked this up off Aliexpress for
a really good price I think it's like 50
USD shipped to your door now again
before you pull the trigger on this
thing I'm not recommending this just yet
because I haven't used it yet I haven't
overclocked with it so I don't know how
it'll go and this is the Xeon x34 50 I
managed to pick up one of these cheap on
Aliexpress but I think the seller sold
out so there is the X 34 40 so after I'm
done overclocking in the build I'll tell
you guys if it's all good to go on some
of this as well this memory this is ddr3
memory I managed to get this off of
Aliexpress as well so that's the whole
package there it's sort of like a used
bargain bin sort of pick up there and
hopefully it performs really well now
for the gram scale look at the RX 470
awesome card you guys know that's one of
the best price performance cards that's
really been knocking down those used
builds there I just love this thing it's
absolutely an amazing value for money
then we've got a deep cool gamax 400
this is about 30 or strained or so in
Australia it's really cheap really good
cooler for the money and then we've got
the power supply they're the 500 watt
Antec awesome go to pounce play one
terabyte hard drive from Toshiba and I'm
just using a $50 case here the CM 593 so
this is just a cheap case if you guys
are on an extreme budget you really
don't even need
like that's what I'd recommend if you
guys are on a budget just don't even
bother with the case just put it on the
motherboard box and have your computer
running like that although if you have
animals and like young kids running
around your house then it might be best
to get a case anyway that's the build
that's coming for you guys so now I
wanted to talk a little bit about Rison
and the on7
1,700 1,700 X and 1,800 X my favorite
pick was the r7 1700 I thought that
thing at 329 USD 8 cause 16 threads
unlocked it's gonna be an absolute beast
hopefully it will be overclockable with
a be 350 motherboard and hopefully I'll
be able to get you guys some day 1
coverage as well so stay tuned for that
but what we can see from the results
already is that for a workstation
definitely it's going to be a kick-ass
price-performance rig that you'll be
able to put together one thing I was
concerned about is how in gaming how is
that sort of Joule CPU interconnected
design going to play out so that's one
thing I'm gonna be testing you know in
depth for you guys the reviews gonna be
really big so I know a lot of people
just want to switch over they want that
value for money they want that
competition that Verizon is going to
bring to the market so I'll be giving
you guys day one review hopefully and
get all the it Ygritte ease out there to
give you guys the best recommendations
on that so other than that I really
can't wait for a rising it's gonna be
something new you're gonna have new
overclocking features a new CPU new
motherboard to play with and it's gonna
be really awesome I really just I'm
excited this is a really good time other
than that what about the r5 and the r3
that's their quad core and 6 core line
when's that hitting the streets I have
really got no idea at the moment I think
they've just announced the a cause and
what about pre-ordering should you
preorder well I mean I don't know cuz I
haven't got the CPU and yet guys I won't
make a recommendation until I do all the
tests and give you guys the reviews but
of course with anything I'd hold off on
pre-ordering just yet I think I don't
believe in that cycle of pre-ordering
unless you know like unless you've tried
the beta or something like that and you
really love it and you're excited about
it and you just want to get it but also
if there's some specific test you want
to see on the rise and review then be
sure to drop a comment the current set
below and I'll try and get it done I
won't have a lot of time if I'm able to
get a date one review done but I'll do
my best for you guys so now I also want
to talk about Aliexpress and is that a
scam and guys I'm gonna tell you guys
I've had some really good deals off
Aliexpress I keep in mind though I have
bought off these sellers with high
feedback I guess it's just like eBay if
you buy from cells with no feedback you
might get scammed so my advice would be
just to buy off sellers with those
really good feedback scores they've sold
thousands of things and you shouldn't
have a problem in I've everything I've
ordered I've gotten it I've received it
I haven't been scammed at all and here's
some of the deals that I've got I got an
ex 56 60 off there I think this cost me
around about this is a six core 12
threaded Xeon from the x58 line I
believe this cost about 50 USD then they
had the really good Bend f56 75 so this
one apparently is like the best in the
overclocks really well so I'm gonna be
testing those two out and also one
interesting thing is they've got the X
54 60 this is the LGA 775 Xeon now
you'll notice that they've also already
pre-drilled the holes here on the side
if pre-drilled holes there and they've
also already looks like they've
pre-applied the sticker to so you don't
even have to apply the sticker they've
already done all the hard work for you
you don't have to chop up your
motherboard you don't have to apply
these sticker so it pretty much makes my
guide useless because they only charge
15 USD for that so there's pretty much
no risk involved and they're like 15
bucks delivered to your door so that's a
really good deal I'll have to update my
video too for that and then we've got
here some fan splitters always need
these when you're doing and when you're
putting a lot of fans in a build fan
splitters are always good they're really
cheap got a controller off here as well
that was like 15 USD it's a memory and
that build that I showed earlier with
the x-15 450 so I'll put all these link
in the links in the description below if
you guys want to check it out so I'll
Express I've had a really good
experience with it let me know in the
comment section below if you've had a
bad experience with it or if you had
really good experiences that would love
to hear your comments and also I've got
the the Z on I got the Z on the qh8 G
off Aliexpress as well so I've just had
nothing but good experiences with it so
now the last thing I wanted to do before
we check up on the deals and wait for
them
responses to come back in is replace my
phone screen here on my huawei I think
it's a p9 ascend now I was at the gym
you know overclocking and stuff and this
screen just it dropped like I dropped my
phone on the floor and it just went
crack and now this is kind of crazy
because I've always like looked at
people who have broken screens on their
phone I'm like how you do that yeah you
know how do you do that to your phone
but now I understand it's just clumsy
and dropping your phone I always thought
people used to like to throw their
phones at the wall so if you know anyone
who does to throw their phone at the
wall drop a comment man I'd love to love
to read up about you know how to methods
on how to chuck your phone against the
wall but let's get on with the screen
replacement
so here I am trying to unscrew this
screen and this seller sends out a
Phillips head screwdriver when this
thing clearly needs like I think it's a
Torx screwdriver like what so I just
gave my friend a call and he came around
and saved my life he brought around this
little one so we're gonna get to work
and repair this screen now alright so I
just pulled the glass off the screen and
my god this was so difficult it took
actually took so long so I'm actually
gonna have to order this new party and I
was following this really good guy but
the guy took all the hardware out of the
back here so you have yeah you have to
replace this whole thing like actually
just replacing that glass there I think
that's like near impossible so I have to
order another thing you know probably
have no phone for like all right shake
it up I got a spare phone so I should be
okay for a phone little bit disappointed
because this thing is just so much more
work than I anticipated so that's crazy
but anyway we're gonna fix that phone
another day I get the order the
digitizer in with this dang alright so I
got on to gum tree and two of the guys
replied saying it wasn't enough money so
they didn't even come back with a
counteroffer either so I'm just gonna
rage quit that and buy an RX 470 done
finished
and now with the build I'm gonna get
onto that right now and do that build
for you guys but also that phone repair
stuff man I've never done that stuff
before and wow that was a lot more
intense than I anticipated that to be
holy crap anyway I've got a lone phone
at the moment this thing here I'm just
gonna use that until I get that new
screen in and then I'll repair that and
hopefully have my p9 working again but
man if it's one thing I've learnt guys
just get a screen protector for your new
phone like yeah if you drop that thing
in the screen cracks it's just a
nightmare to repair it or I guess if you
take it to a place they'll charge you
quite a bit to repair it
anyway if you guys enjoyed this video
then be sure to hit that like button and
let me know in the comment section below
what you think that PC will perform like
I've got to give it a name too but I
can't wait to give you guys the content
and I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
