car but you don't know if you want to
get the AMD rx 560 or the NVIDIA GTX
1050 TI well today this video should
give you the right answer welcome back
to tech yes City's brand coming to you
guys today with that showdown that y'all
have been waiting for at well actually
don't know if you've been waiting for it
but hopefully you have been because I'm
doing the video right now but anyway
with that said let's get on with the
most important thing and that is the
benchmarks
and as always the benchmarks do all the
talking in this case the 10:50 tee I did
win by quite a sizable margin and then
also when I went to overclock these
graphics cards the RX 560 did overclock
in scale better than the tempered eg I
did in this regard
however the temperatures were quite high
for the RX 560 in comparison to the gtx
750ti i believe when i overclocked both
these cards with 80% fan speeds the
temperature ta was hovering around 48
degrees and the iris paucity was up
around 66 degrees is that a 25 degree
ambient temperature now of course this
is attributable to the power savings
that the 1050 Ti does use in comparison
to the rx 560 I believe it was using
around a solid 20 watts less from the
wall and that's pretty much coming
directly from the card since the test
system was exactly the same with the
graphics cards being the only difference
however another thing I was surprised
with was get even this is a new title
that's really not mainstream it's not a
triple-a title and also practically the
Nvidia graphics card was doing a lot
better it was almost performing double
that of the rx 560 and in the past I
believe years ago with games like heroes
and us and stuff Nvidia have had better
support for more indie title games out
of the get-go so in that regard if you
guys are into indie games and then your
entry-level GPU like the Tempe 2ti or
the rx 550 then I would recommend the
temperature TI hands down over the rx
560 and even for the majority of games
even if they're triple-a titles I would
still recommend the 1050 Ti over the rx
560 and it's unfortunate because the rx
550 is meant to come in at $100 MSRP
however I the cheapest I could find the
4 gigabyte edition for was 130 US as
opposed to the template ETI which comes
in at an MSRP of 139 dollars however
that was hovering around one hundred and
forty-five dollars so in this current
cryptocurrency mining apocalypse both
these graphics cards are solid options
if you're looking to get into PC gaming
however keep in mind though with the
temper TTI it isn't that far off its
MSRP
so it is a better buy it current prices
however if the MSRP was holding true for
the rx 560 then I could certainly
recommend that depending on what
performance you want to get say for
instance you're going with the G 45 16
you want to keep costs really though
then the RS 5 60 if it was to be a
hundred dollars would be a very solid
recommendation and give in mind there's
also the ten fifty as well the non TI
variant the two gigabyte card which will
do a great job if you just want to play
games like counter-strike CF go or if
you want to play a dota 2 or even pub G
on low settings I'm sure these graphics
cards will do a fine job of doing all
those games and they are very popular
multiplayer titles however what about
other parts of the world we're currently
in Australia the 1050 ti4 g'bye variant
is only $15 more that's Australian
dollars so that be closer to 10 us more
than the rx 550 so if you guys are in
Australia down under looking for a
entry-level graphics card then again I
would recommend the 1050 Ti over the rx
560 at its current prices in Australia
and a lot of couple of things to talk
about with both these graphics cards of
course the AMD graphics cards carry free
sync and that's a syncing technology
that matches the monitors refresh rate
to the graphics card itself ensuring no
screen tearing especially if you're on a
budget so that's something you want then
you want to look into the RX 560 as it
does offer that option though the 1050
Ti on the other hand does use less power
with that you can find variants of this
graphics card that don't require a 6-pin
connector and with that I do prefer
having no 6 pin connector on board so in
a lot of cases I can recommend this to
people who have an OEM system or want to
go grab a used OEM system off eBay with
like a 4 core i5 2400 for example those
go really cheap those OEM systems
pop in a GTX 1050 Ti and you've got one
awesome gaming rig without having to
change around the power supply in a lot
of cases and of course you've probably
heard this that many times already but I
will say it again if you can pick up a
GTX 1060 or an RX 570 for cheap then I
would go with that route of course they
are getting sold out due to the
cryptocurrency mining boom but if they
do get in stock at around $200 or a
little bit less than that
then of course they are the recommended
by in my opinion over both of these
graphics cards shown here today as they
perform a lot better
in terms of raw performance hey guys I
hope you enjoyed today's showdown ugly
temper TT I'd versus the rx 560 and if
you didn't be sure to hit that like
button I also asked you guys on Twitter
which grabs card would you buy out of a
temper TTI and rx 560 and a 1015 on Ti
and a lot of you guys agree with my
sentiment the 1050 t I came in with the
majority of votes so thank you guys for
interacting with us on Twitter and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now
bye
Oh
