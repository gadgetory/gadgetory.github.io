to record this video and the website
that I was trying to download the
software for for this it was just having
a heap of Network errors and after about
a hundred clicks of trying to get it
through I finally got it downloaded I
guess that has to do with some firewall
and the company might be based in China
but this right here is a BIOS program
and this is the teal 866 I think it is
CS and I'm actually told that it's not
that good in 2018 apparently the one you
should get now is like a $2.00 USB one
called the three for one and that's
really cheap this one cost me like
thirty dollars and anyway we're going to
find out because I haven't used it yet
and that's because I didn't know about
this these are essentially a jaw that
can clip onto the motherboard and then
from there you can plug it to the BIOS
programmer which can then go into your
main computer that works and you can
essentially flash a new BIOS onto a
board with a single bus that would have
otherwise been bricked and today I've
been donated to motherboards here from a
friend that I'm told were bricked during
a BIOS update so it makes them perfect
candidates to test whether or not this
will work and yes that also looks like
it does need a new Southbridge heatsink
as well
so the next step now is just to grab
your motherboard put it down on a desk
grab your little programming tool this
one here plug it into your computer via
USB and then get the little circuit
board it should actually come with a
circuit board this is this little
circuit board here that will plug to the
jaws of life and then these will then
plug to the motherboard and then from
this actual computer here we can
download the software now which again
took us a day to download plug it up to
this motherboard and then hopefully
flash the BIOS from an external source
and then hopefully this motherboard
should work again but yeah let's try to
do this yesterday so after you
downloaded and installed the software
from the website for whatever
programming you're going to use you have
to then load up the BIOS and then copy
the configuration into that particular
bar setting with the mini pro programmer
it actually didn't auto detect what it
was so I had to find out that the actual
biased chip used was a Mac chronics 32
series a chip and was an 8-pin chip
after this I started coming into the
realization that the jaws that I used
were actually a very low quality and so
I had to reconnect them so many
different times I even sprayed the
motherboards BIOS chip down with wd-40
on both motherboards and eventually we
got a good connection but it still
wasn't a hundred percent for instance
one of the BIOS flashes actually took an
hour and a half to perform this was
really surprising but the first one did
it pretty quickly so it's now the next
day and the results are in and I will
say straight up that one of the
motherboards is now working which is
awesome news because that motherboard I
believe is worth about 40 US dollars on
Aliexpress the market rates for it the
other motherboard however was very
problematic beforehand it wouldn't boot
up properly in that I had to hit the
clear CMOS button and then it would
finally restart and just shut off but
then we installed the new BIOS and it
still did the same thing so I started
inspecting the pins on this motherboard
and a lot of them were actually bent so
that's a
in itself pawn bending the pins back we
did manage to get it to boot and stay on
this time but there was unfortunately no
signal coming out of the second
motherboard so these are the both the
same motherboards so one of them ended
up working one of them must have some
other problems besides the BIOS itself
also talked about the gear right here
because one of the devices I do not
recommend and that's this jaws here it's
really cheap to the point where it
doesn't get a good connection a lot of
the times I had to fiddle around for
hours just to make sure that it was
finally connected properly and I did
everything right from the get-go had the
one on the top right here and then had
the red on the one or the little error
on the bios and then had this connected
in tandem to the one on this and
everything was supposed to work properly
but it just took so many tries to
connect these little jaws properly
themselves to the point where I had to
spray wd-40 on actually both of the
motherboards and then I finally got a
signal and one of the boss flashes was
pretty quick the other was giving out
error messages and I had to uncheck
check device ID and also check verify
and then it took literally an hour and a
half to flash the bios from this program
so the TL 866 itself as others have
mentioned it is a little bit expensive I
think especially if you're just gonna
get this in a pair of jaws there are
much cheaper options I think the three
for one is the popular choice you can
get a flight two or three dollars
however with the jaws I would recommend
getting a much higher quality one that
connects properly this one here was like
a couple of dollars but it really gave
me a lot of issues and a lot of problems
when connecting so if you are gonna get
one of these and you gonna use it
regularly then definitely spend some
extra money I'm gonna go back and
reorder one that's of high quality and
it clicks on properly and so I don't get
any problems when I'm trying to flash a
BIOS externally but other than that I
thank you guys so much for recommending
me this stuff it's already saved one
motherboard and I'm sure it's going to
save a lot more going into the future
and it's already paid for itself with
the motherboard that's been salvaged so
I can't recommend it the learning curve
really isn't that bad it took me a few
hours to get used to everything
and as I said just before definitely get
yourself a decent pair of jewels if you
wish to do this and the beauty is you
don't have to de sold or anything and
then you can get an answer straight away
anyway in terms of that other multiple
that didn't boot probably I've tried
bending the pins back as perfect as I
can get them and it's just not booting
still it was giving us a difference
before and after which does indicate
that maybe it is the pins indeed on the
CPU socket I mean I'll give it another
attempt but spend a lot of time already
trying to bend those pins back and it's
just not working so you guys hope you
enjoyed today's video and know it's
pretty quick but these things definitely
they're good I can recommend them and if
you have any experiences of your own
with bringing boards back to life would
love reading those thoughts and opinions
and also don't forget to hit that like
button and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
