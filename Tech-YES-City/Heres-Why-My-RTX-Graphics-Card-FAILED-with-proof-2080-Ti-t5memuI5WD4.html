released there was numerous reports out
there of cards just randomly artifacting
or even giving beasts odds or just
things crashing completely to the point
where the computer wouldn't boot
normally again and here on the desk I
have one of those faulty RT X xx ATT is
when I was doing the benchmarks for the
galaxy EXO CRT X 2070 review I was
benchmarking shadows of the Tomb Raider
and pretty much finishing up the
benchmarks when this card
all of the sudden out of nowhere just
started artifacting and then the game
crashed out and gave me an error message
and this was on out of the box stock
settings for this gravis card so what
exactly is going on with these RTS
gravis cards let's talk about some of
the rumors of hurt as well as getting a
reliable source to tell me what has been
going on with these r-tx gravis cards so
let's dig into it
welcome back to the channel guys I hope
you're all doing great out there but
here's the r-tx 20 ATT I will set up the
test bench very soon to test this out
and do more demonstrations of what's
going on but the issues here was said to
affect the r-tx 2080 TI the 2080 and
even the 2070 and now after doing some
testing here and later on we're gonna
pull this graph Scott apart because I
actually don't know what memory is
inside this gravis card it is apparently
micron and Samsung that have been
manufacturing the GDD r6 memory for the
RT x-series cards and now we're talking
about the memory because that is where I
believe the problem lies exactly on
these gravis cards but in this instance
I heard from the overclocking community
that's the guys who do the L into
overclocking that the micron GD dr6
memory quote-unquote was dropping like
flies in competitions and so this is the
biggest problem here that there's rumors
going around that it is the micron GD r6
memory that is failing so quickly and so
what this means is is that it's actually
degrading rapidly and so when you get
the card and it's passing the stress
test it's passing the quality test its
then released to the market and so when
a person buys this graphics card puts it
in their computer starts playing it for
awhile they may have a couple of weeks
of good usage or even a month or a
couple of months and then all of a
sudden they start getting artifacting
and that's basically rapid degradation
in this case of what I believe is rapid
degradation on the micron GD j r6 memory
and now here's where we're going to show
you guys exactly what we're talking
about in two different steps first of
all I'm going to boot the card off and
show you the problem exactly on this 20
atti
and then second of all we're gonna take
this car apart and examine what memory
is on board this grabs card where I just
have an inkling that it's micron memory
but we'll check it out let's run the
tests
here we are now we've loaded up windows
we've got the grabbes card ready our TX
28 ETA latest driver and what we're
going to do is show you guys here just
complete default settings we're gonna
load up UniGene heaven and you're gonna
see straight away that it's just gonna
crash out pretty much right in front of
your very eyes so let's just show this
right now so
yes I am like I'm recording this in live
real-time so you're seeing exactly
what's going on here it's just artifact
tents having all sorts of problems but
while we're keeping this recording what
we're gonna actually do guys is just go
back to Windows quickly and what we're
gonna do now is put up MSI Afterburner
right in front of your very eyes grab
that memory clock and set that down all
the way - 502 megahertz so what it's
going to do is it's going to drop the
effective speeds from I believe 14
gigahertz to 13 gigahertz on the memory
and now let's get back into that UniGene
heaven and see if this benchmark works
so we'll actually restart it just to
make sure everything's okay because it's
changed the resolution but yeah bear
with me for a couple of seconds let's
boot this up again
so we can leave this running for a good
10 20 minutes it doesn't matter it's
going to work perfectly now the memory
is as we said before at 13 gigahertz
effective and we've just got no problems
whatsoever there's no artifacting and
yells I'll just leave this going for a
very long time just to illustrate let
the grabs car warm up but we've
definitely found out that it is the
memory speeds directly and in turn what
I believe is rapid degradation
so we're just about to open this thing
up but before I did I managed to do some
benchmarks for the galaxy x OC review
because I already had this thing open
and I ran some numbers and the speeds
with the memory slider all the way down
the bottom versus out of the box
settings before this started artifacting
showed a difference that was so
negligible I mean in shadows of the Tomb
Raider we got a one FPS difference
moving over to Rainbow six siege showed
a two FPS difference which again is down
to a margin of error and then moving
over to Far Cry 5 actually got the same
FPS numbers when I reran that test but
guys let's open this graphics card up
together and see what memory we have
inside my bet is it does have micron
memory but all will be revealed very
soon
you
so there's a first time opening this
thing up and it's sadly as expected does
indeed have the micron GDD are six
memory you can tell by the EM logo
stamped on each of the banks here so
that's not some good news but another
crazy thing is look at the amount of
circuitry on this freaking card this is
absolutely insane this is my first time
opening up a twenty eight ET I go guys
let's discuss this a little bit more
I'll shed my opinion on the matter on
what I think the exact problems are and
sort of recap what we discovered here
today so now here we are with the RT x
twenty eight ETA that is failing with
out of the box settings and of course
that isn't good and if you bought one of
these you're well within your rights to
replace it or get a refund as it's
supposed to work at the intended
specifications but here's where I'm in a
unique position for me personally and
why would anyone want to fix this
problem and just get along with it well
there's a few reasons one being that
this is a review sample and I actually
don't want to bother horas especially
when I can still get it working and
still make use of the gravis card rather
than just wasting or assist time when I
don't think it's got anything to do with
them personally it's not their fault and
also another thing is is that I'm
grateful for anything that comes through
the channel so just like that deep cool
case with the broken clasp I just like
to make use of what I've got I guess
that's one of the biggest mottos of the
channel here especially if you see the
use build of course there's that other
group of people who are picking up RTX
grabs cards secondhand and they don't
have the original receipt and don't
laugh there actually are people out
there selling RTS graphics cards one of
my friends in California already picked
one up on offer up anyway this grabs
card here who's the blame and what is
exactly the problem here well I think
we've established that it's GDD are six
memory from micron and what I believe is
could be a number of things
this is where maybe we have to have more
people speak out about it if they know
exactly what's going on it could be a
bad batch of micron memory that made it
through the process and is out in the
wild and it will be fixed in due time or
it could be that it's widespread with
micron memory in that in this case we
saw with this graphics card that the
memory was rapidly degrading that's the
only way to describe it it works when I
got it and then it doesn't work without
the box settings but it works when we
drop the memory speeds down so that's
the problem right there
it also reaffirms what I've heard from
professional overclockers and also what
I heard on different articles I think
Tom's did an article about them
suspecting it was the GDD r6 memory but
then they put a thermal imaging sensor
on it and found that it wasn't the
problem and then a gamer's Nexus did a
very detailed article on it but they
didn't specify I think the micron memory
exactly I did manage to put my FLIR one
camera on it and we saw 85 degrees
maximum but we do know at micro points
that things can get a little bit hotter
than expected so it's really up in the
air but at least with this sample I've
got closure on the issue I know exactly
what's going on and so that's just my
recommendation if you guys got one of
these and it's got micron memory on it
and you start having an artifacting or
it starts crashing or it starts doing
what it did here today then you may wish
to get a replacement or you can turn a
negative into a positive
in that you could keep that memory
slider down there and then one month
before your warrant you guys I hope you
enjoyed today's video as for this card
I'll be putting it back together putting
it in my main rig and as I said before
I'll update the description or even make
an update video on what is going on
exactly with this card after say maybe
six months or if it degrades before then
we'll report back but I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did be sure to
hit that like button also let us know in
the comment section below what you think
of this
issue have you had any problems with our
TX cards or what are your thoughts love
reading them as always and if you also
have more news on this issue I'd love to
read your comments on that as well and
of course there's that question of who
is to blame in this case and I'm someone
who always gives someone the benefit of
the doubt initially so I mean I would
say it's just a bad batch of micron
memory that got through the initial
testing and then made its way out to the
wild and of course it's going to be
coming back home in the form of RMA so
these things do happen
I just think the also the twenty-eighth
ETI being a beast as it is does put out
a lot of heat so there's that maybe I've
stumbled onto the answers for you guys I
hope I have and I hope this resolves
this r-tx
issue of the cards failing and
artifacting anyway guys I will catch it
in the next tech video very soon if you
want to see it as soon as it's released
then be sure to hit that sub button with
the notification bell and also if you
want that inside scoop before it even
hits YouTube's loop be sure to check us
out on Instagram check es city I'll
catch you in the next one very soon
peace out for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
