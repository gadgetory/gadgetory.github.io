cities baronies are coming back to you
guys today with not only a review of the
rode videomic but also a review and
quality test of the rode videomic pro
now we're going to put these
head-to-head and see which one is better
bang for buck or which one should you
buy in which circumstance so the first
one we'll have a look at the rode
videomic and as you can see here it is
just it's a little bit bigger than the
rode videomic pro the original video
mike has here the features if you take
off this battery cover here inside its
got the ability to attenuate minus 10
decibels or minus 20 decibels so if you
are in a very loud area you can still
get a good signal without a clipping so
it's a very good feature on this one
also it does weigh in so this one here
weighs in at about 185 grams so this
here weighs in at 185 grams however that
being said you can remove this shock
mount here and it will go down to a
hundred grams so it'll be almost the
same weight as the pro if you take off
the shock mount so if you don't need the
shock mount which a lot of times if you
like I'm recording now if you're
recording in a stationary environment
you will not need the shock mount so
that is an option to do as well one
thing about the rode videomic though is
that this here this actually even if you
take the shock mount off where the cold
shoe mount mounts up to here it'll still
hang over so if you've got a small DSLR
camera like I do now at the USM this
will sort of clip over the screen so it
can be a little bit annoying I would
recommend this into the size and the
weight i recommend this for more a
bigger DSLR or a video camera so i'd
recommend this one in size in the terms
of size for a video camera or bigger
DSLR with a smaller DSLR I definitely go
with this one as you can see here with
the cold shoe mount right here it's very
cut off so you put this on your camera
and it will be flush with your screen
especially on a small DSLR camera now
this one only weighs 85 grams without
the battery inside so it is very light
it's very good if you're coupled again
with small DSLR camera now this one
instead of having minus 20 decibels
they've actually switched that around
and made it plus 20 decibels so
this here in my opinion if you're using
the onboard camera audio you'll probably
want to go this one as you can turn the
recording level on your on your camera
all the way down and then you can turn
this up to 20 decibels and take
advantage of the road the roads app that
condenser microphone instead of relying
on the cameras amp which tends to be
cheap which tend to be achieving a lot
of mid-range lower end DSLRs so
basically what I'm trying to say is if
you have your recording level turned on
to half way on the camera and use this
on flat no decibelle gain the signal
would sound better if you turned it the
recording level on the camera all the
way down and turn this to 20 so i'll do
that i'll do a quality test later and
show you guys what I'm talking about and
under the other features they both have
both these cameras both feature a flat
and a high-pass filter at 80 hurts so
they both have that feature as well so
there's no difference there now in terms
of build quality i'm going to say they
both came with a 10 year warranty which
is fantastic however this the rode
videomic feels a lot more solid and a
lot more sturdier than the videomic pro
when i was putting in the battery in the
row videomic pro i felt like i did hear
something click when i was putting the
battery and i just like this little
clicker motor I don't see that lasting
10 years this however feels very sturdy
I put the battery and no problems it
slides in and out easy it's very sturdy
products so I liked the video Mike's
build quality better than the very
videomic pro so in a nutshell I'm just
going to get on with the quality tests
and show you you know you guys can hear
the difference if there is any I think
on a flat level they both sound the same
however I think when you turn this up to
plus 20 decibels and turn the recording
level down on the camera you will then
start to hear the difference and also
before we get to the tests i will say
that i do use the rode videomic pro
because i'm using a Canon EOS m so let's
get on to the tests okay guys so this is
the rode videomic original so this is on
zero decibel gain also on flat and
hopefully it sounds good are there may
be a lawnmower
in the background that you can hear so
that is not actual hissing noise or
anything that's legit lawn mower in the
background anyway let's move on to the
rode videomic pro okay so here is a test
with the rode videomic pro so this is
our recording levels on halfway as well
and also the zero decibels it's on zero
dispel gain so let's switch over now to
plus twenty a decibelle game and
hopefully I don't know can you guys hear
a difference is there any difference
between sound quality between the rode
videomic and the rode videomic pro 10
decibels I don't know I'm going to check
as well but let's move on to the + 20
decibels and we'll turn the recording
level all the way down to the bottom
with four notches just four notches
above lowest setting so let's go okay so
here is the rode videomic pro now on +
20 decibels and the recording level is
four notches below the lowest it can be
so what do you guys think do you think
the + 20 the decibel sounds the best
what do you think they wrote rode
videomic sounds the best or do you think
the rode videomic pro sounds the best on
zero decibelle gains let me know you
guys in the comments section below also
if you enjoyed this sort of comparison
and quick review of both let me know and
also this if there's anything else you
want wish to know about these
microphones please let me know a battery
life on the road videomic the original
is also estimated 30 hours longer so
it's estimated a hundred hours as
opposed to the rode videomic pro which
is only 70 hours because i guess they
take into account that everyone's going
to use the + 20 decibelle feature who
knows anyway all in all i will say that
this was filmed on the canon eos m and i
do recommend it and i do recommend rode
videomic they are insanely good for the
price even though they look expensive
than what the competition is offering
they're definitely worth it you won't
see yourself spending more money in the
future that's a good thing about these
things they're real condenser
microphones that sit on your camera so
when you're filming and you need that
really good sound you'll definitely get
it from a rode your bike and no I'm not
