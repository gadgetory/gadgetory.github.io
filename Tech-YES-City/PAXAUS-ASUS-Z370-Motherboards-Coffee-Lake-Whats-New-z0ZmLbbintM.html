am at the azuz conference for the new si
370 launch of their motherboards and
actually quite a bit as changing this
time and I'm joined here by Jack how you
doing good yes okay nice nice to
actually be honest camera again this
year we are in that with the jet stream
at 70 launch we are already in the tens
generation of the Maximus series okay in
this series of course he actually
actually going to see the streak she's
now taking part up to our G segments
plus we will actually see some changes
in a tough series where you actually go
from the extreme high-end workstation
more more MORE about gaming's come over
get me in segments okay to our sheet
allow you to actually have 24/7 gaming
workstations running 24/7 for you okay
and of course there will also be some
prime series as well now notice with the
tough series you guys are actually
making this tough as in the word T ough
right things are stronger on this
motherboard there's also that land guard
which protects against lightning strikes
now me personally I've had a motherboard
blow out the N I see or the Nick on
board and I couldn't get it working
again but the rest of the motherboard
work fine so something like the land
guard is a great feature on the new
tough series yeah yes definitely we
would pop on the lent guard we also have
we also have P SD card washy car against
any sort of ESD protect any sort of yes
this like ask now
wait wearing rubber shoes and coppers
you were most likely to actually damage
any of you I always when you try to
actually fiddle around and try to
actually plug any device any devices
onto you know your PC is this or return
now okay
and what you will actually be damaging
will not only be on a device all the
part you will actually be killing your
chipset that's awesome I've tried to
kill parts with ESD before I failed I
couldn't do it so I guess more
protection might be a better thing but
now there's two technologies on the new
Z 370 line of I guess the first ones not
really a technology but more a
convenience thing and that's the
input/output shields and now completely
implemented onto the motherboard now me
personally I do mingle with new parts
but also mingle with use parts and
something like this is going to create a
lot less hassles especially when I'm
picking up one of these Z 370 boards
five years time and I don't need to
worry about it not having an i/o shield
is that something you guys are proud
about with implementing an IO shield
integrated into the motherboard yes
Tiffany we over the years we have
actually collected all of use of
feedbacks and what they actually need
and one of the things that we actually
found is we suite a lot of people when
they actually assemble a system they
forget about IO shield or they actually
actually installed it multiple enrollee
that you actually had something sticking
into IO posts from Rio showed in that
case for normal K for normal users they
will need to actually reassemble
assistant or to come help okay so in
order to actually help disk of these
customers we actually developed the pre
mount back is where we already prima on
there too once you actually ready to
actually install this multiple inside
your case you just mount this
motherboard in just load it in like it
like without IO shield and then you
actually be there simple as that
awesome and the last technology we're
gonna talk about here today is the
optimum I noticed that's coming in you
with the Z 370 lineup basically that's
to do with the layers of PCB and the
connectivities through the layers if I
imagine right yeah
that's correct okay you know for multi
for multi-layer PCBs you in order to
actually travel from one day to another
you will actually need to actually use
so we saw conveyor hose to actually go
between different layers however every
time when you actually go shoot a layers
they will actually be a deduction of
they were she'd be a degrade of signal
signal quality so the more the more you
actually goes through of course they
were she'd be weaker signals so what we
are who we are actually developed is
actually a cry line for engineers who
actually develop motherboards in a way
that we are trying to actually minimized
the chances of construe the BIOS okay by
doing that we can improve the memory
scalability by significantly in this
generation okay you will actually expect
our entry motherboards with of the the
memory to actually be able to actually
perform as well as higher motherboards
in the memory scaling all right that
sounds like some awesome new
technologies thanks for your time
and I'll see you around now I'm joined
here by Herbert he is going to explain
to me why a Zeus has been dominating in
the motherboard market I mean from what
I'm told
45 percent market share and there are a
lot of other good players in this game
what is making you guys set yourselves
apart from the competition with
dominating the market because we focus
on the product it's like for the design
we always invest lots of resources on
the features we make all impossible
thing become possible for example like
USB bio flashback five-way optimization
also all writing software is one of the
key features to target the gaming market
as well now one thing I saw in the
presentation here was that you guys are
implementing a 5 gigahertz overclock on
your new Zeus z3 70 motherboards now
this is very interesting because a lot
of people will just want to lock it in
they've got really good cooling and in a
lot of cases they'll be able to hit
these 5 gigahertz speeds on an 80 700 K
yet
yes is in queen of innovate optimization
and also we have the BIOS different
setting for that performance
so now with 2017 practically being
labeled as the year of RGB which I
completely agree with I've noticed that
a Zeus have been pushing their new or a
sync technology though how does this
differ itself from the competitors we
had the first one two features for P now
GB header and also three pin accessible
header on the same motherboard this we
are the first one for these features
also for issues or a thing if we compare
to other competitor their aura or their
lighting technology only Magna control
multiple and me Jacob but for Asus we
partner with lots of different vendor so
we released or our SDK because as our
SDK to let the other vendor to invest
their resource to sing with our
motherboard so we're using one software
we can sing with all other component
which other Camilla can cannot do it
also you know issues we do have Martha
Malabar ichika we do have monitor we do
have keyboard mouse so everything can
singing together by using one software
awesome now with the internet going
abuzz with the z3 70 chipsets and
obviously the 8th gen coffee like CPUs
with the zeus now you guys a lot of
people out there they like to make
tweaks in the BIOS so whether it be a
non even and non overclockable CPU in
the past we have seen even just raising
memory speeds and little things like
that do you have any tips and tricks for
the viewers with your zeus motherboards
on how they can get better performance
out of their CPUs whether it be easy
tweaks or even more experience of
difficult weeks for XMP it will for the
steps 317 new motherboard automatic
activate these features for the beginner
it is extremely easy to use
so basically a lot of people that's
actually pretty good because a lot of
people don't usually they get Z 370
motherboards in the past or they got Z
to 70s for example and they got these
motherboards and they have XMP profiles
and they don't enable it and they don't
overclock anything so they're now
gaining that performance automatically
if you're a beginner so that's actually
not a bad feature now obviously there's
another thing with multi-core
enhancement MCE is that something on a
zeus motherboards it's activated by
default yes it is essentially on the
8700 k as you guys know will turbo your
cpu up to the all cores on the top ratio
so i believe in the 8700 k you'll get
4.7 gb that's on all course whether your
cpu can do that or not that's still up
to the cooler that you have of course
and if the cpu will run at those
temperatures and your ambient
temperatures there's a lot more to it
than that but anyway herbert thank you
for coming out today and it was a
pleasure speaking to you and also jack
about the new motherboard lineup they
are indeed innovating that input/output
shield I believe that will be a feature
that you will see a lot of other
motherboard manufacturers implementing
on their motherboards in due time anyway
guys if you have any questions for
herbert or jack or me then drop a comma
in the comment section below and i will
get back to you guys as soon as I can
and for now I want you guys to peace out
and I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
