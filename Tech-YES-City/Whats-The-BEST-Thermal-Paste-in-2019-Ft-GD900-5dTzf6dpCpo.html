paste in the previous video I did which
was quite a while ago I compared a GC
extreme against mx4 and in that video I
wanted to show that there actually can
be a considerable difference between
what type of thermal paste you use
depending on your application in the
case of parts that aren't overclockable
you don't have a whole lot to worry
about and in fact you're probably better
off going with something like MX 4 if
you're not into enthusiasts overclocks
and the reason being is because you get
a lot of that stuff non capacitive non
conductive and it's very easy to spread
the viscosity is pretty good but since I
did that video you guys were requesting
a take a look at more thermal paste
broaden the horizon check out the
temperatures but also check out the
amount you get the value for money and
of course the viscosity to see which is
best for enthusiasts and also which is
best for hustlers so in today's video
we're going to be testing all that with
our trusty friend here the r-tx 20 atti
from morris but on that note Oris did
contact me after that video a while ago
and they insisted that they get the card
back because they actually wanted to
investigate it and I mean for me
personally trading a faulty pot for a
brand new working part kind of a
no-brainer so I decided to say yes we've
got the brand new one back here so this
is going to be our guinea pig he's gonna
be patient zero for this experiment and
also another reason why I'm picking the
2080 TI is because it puts out a lot of
heat and so that's gonna be great for
stressing these thermal paste out and
also making the difference is bigger if
there are any with that aside let's get
on with the contenders and then of
course get on with the testing
so starting from left to right we've got
here no name brand massive amount of
thermal paste I bought this on
Aliexpress for under $2 so you're
getting a lot of thermal paste for your
money next to that was a community
recommended GD 900 where people actually
say this stuff performs very close to
the mx4 I did get a massive tube of this
for I believe six dollars delivered to
my door and then beside that is course
as TM 30 a recent addition to the
thermal paste industry they've sent some
over because they want me to use it in
builds because they are a sponsor and
then we've got MX 4 which is the staple
in the industry and the reason being is
because you can get these massive tubes
and it does do a pretty good job it's
non capacitive non conductive and of
course the viscosity is pretty good so
it's a great option in my opinion for
hustlers then we've got the GC extreme
which we already know outperforms the MX
4 but of course it is a little bit
harder to spread and it is much more
expensive than the MX 4 then besides
that it's probably one of the most
interesting in the bunch this is the
kingpin cooling a lot of ln2
overclockers swear by this stuff but
apparently it doesn't do good in normal
ambient temperatures and then the last
two on the list is the knock Shore nth
one it's the only knock Shore thermal
paste they have around here but we'll
test it anyway and then there's some
thermal grizzly I think it is cryo
naught well it's the only one that
you're allowed to put on the actual
silicon itself because the rest of them
on their website aren't actually
recommended for putting on direct
silicon to cooler and since this is a 20
80 TI I ain't risking anything but with
all that out of the way let the games
begin
that's Italian for let the games begin
and we're gonna be testing out a
baseline first for the 2080 TI to know
how this thing performs out of the box
with a set fan speed and what
temperature's it gets so let's get on
with the show
and here we are the next day with all
the results compiled this one is
actually very interesting stayed up till
2:00 a.m. as well to get this testing
done because this is the only chance I'm
going to get before coffee tax and you
guys really wanted to see this video so
if you appreciated enough hit that like
button a little bit early for us but
let's get on with the results and I'm
gonna get straight into it because we've
got two clear winners here after testing
this on the 28th ETI and the kingpin
cooling solution came in at number one
getting sixty nine degrees maximum now I
was told this stuff was only good for
ln2 situations and if you're cooling it
with air and water cooling it wouldn't
do as well but it's beating all the
other pace here by a little bit and
although it's expensive it was beating
out GC extreme which came in second
place with 71 degrees but the two degree
difference really shows that this stuff
is on top so there is a reason that
everyone at L in two events was using
this stuff and when I saw that at the
Galax live overclocking event last year
I knew I had to get some so I actually
bought this off someone at the event for
10 bucks I'm like hey can I quickly have
that tube because I was rounding up all
the best of the best thermal paste and
then we're coming in with the next best
thing and this was a recommendation from
you guys in the previous video you said
Brian there's these sellers on
Aliexpress selling the GT 900 and you
can get this stuff I think I got this
for like six or seven dollars for a tube
of thirty grams and I didn't expect much
out of it but when we put it on the
twenty atti
I was shocked because this stuff is
going to be even though the kingpin
Cooling's number one for enthusiasts who
want to get the best overclocks and the
best temperatures I'm gonna be giving
this stuff kind of like the number one
in general because it's so easy to
spread it had the best spreading
qualities of all the thermal paste I
tested here and that the viscosity was
just right it was a little bit better
than Amex for which I'd say came in
second place with viscosity but you get
30 grams of this stuff and it's cooling
performance is pretty much better than
mx4 and I'm definitely going to be
ordering myself
more of these because I'm just shocked
at how good they are if you're a hustler
and you got to do a lot of builds and
you're constantly changing over coolers
cleaning up coolers or cleaning up old
thermal paste this stuff is great
non-conductive non capacitive and on
that note I'm pretty sure all the
thermal paste I tested here today are
non conductive non capacitive because I
did put a lot of thermal paste on
because you have to with the 28 eg I
since it's just the silicon exposed to
the cooler so there we have it
number one GT 904 hustlers number one
for cooling kingpin cooling now I will
point out some other things about the
other thermal piece and that is that the
thermal grizzly paste that I got gifted
from Dave up in Brisbane Dave I don't
know why you gifted me this it was an
empty tube when I went to put it on I
was like what's going on I've just got
an empty tube here and pretty much
there's no thermal paste left so maybe
if I redo this video again it's going to
be all you guys in the comments with
what thermal paste you want to see in
the next comparison but on that note
let's talk about some of the other
thermal paste in this comparison the mx4
it's a staple it works pretty good
viscosity is great it's a reliable
choice and it has been for years due to
what it is so I can still recommend that
but the GT 900 again is just beating it
out in every aspect and that stuff is a
lot better value for money into and how
much you get as for the corsair TM 30
you guys are the channel sponsors here
that I got a point this thermal paste
out man it's not that good at all you're
getting I think three grams for eight
dollars and the viscosity isn't as good
as mx4 or as good as the GD 900 and the
cooling performance was just as good as
the MX 4 which keep in mind the MX 4 and
the TM 30 did for one degree behind the
stock thermal paste on the gigabyte card
but on that note the stock thermal paste
on the r-tx 20 atti horas here it was
horrible to clean off like this is when
I first opened up the cooler
I took ages to clean this stuff off so
whatever gigabyte Oris are using on
their graphics guys it does work well
but it is really annoying if you want to
clean it up and put some kingpin cooling
on there for example but the other stuff
to talk about was the nock schewe NT h1
and this stuff was ok it was actually
pretty smooth to spread so if you loved
the spread method above all else then
this stuff was actually pleasantly good
and the temperatures were pretty much
run-of-the-mill now the last several
days to talk about is the two-dollar
solution as you guys saw in the graphs
this was absolutely horrible it pretty
much failed the test as soon as I saw
this going up to 87 degrees I was like
no way turned and shot the tests off
straight away and I mean for two dollars
it did I guess kind of work but in that
sense I wouldn't recommend it at all
when the GD 900 exists and that actually
does a proper job of being thermal paste
so this stuff here is pretty much for I
didn't even know who it's for I wouldn't
use this stuff at all absolutely
horrible but the viscosity was half
decent but yeah after this video I'm
pretty much chucking this straight in
the bin it's hazardous because you don't
want your parts overheating because that
will pretty much cost you more than two
dollars in the long run
and lastly besides the cheap thermal
paste across the board here I looked at
the sustained clock speeds the stock
paste the Tam 30 and also the Arctic mx4
scored 1935 megahertz sustained and then
the rest of the thermal paste scored
nineteen hundred and fifty megahertz if
that's anything to go by I know it's a
very subtle difference but we are
getting down now to where the good
thermal pace are really good so there
will be those subtle differences to
report on and so here we are at the
conclusion now with the two winners as
we said before King pen cooling for
enthusiasts which does cost a little bit
more than the rest of the stuff and then
we've got the GD 900 for general usage
and most applications as it did a really
good job compared to the last video we
did I really only looked at GC extreme
and also mx4 but GC extreme was what the
pro overclocked is used to use before
kingpin Cooling's
solution came out so if anything to go
by we've just got the new updated metas
right here but it was very impressive to
see that we do have two new champions in
the scene in terms of the other thermal
pace as I said before as well guys let
me know in the comments for the next
update what you want to see but I'm also
going to ask for your feedback on what
to test with next because I do know one
thing when it comes to testing these
thermal pace out I do like to get the
smallest piece of silicon area that puts
out the highest amount of heat so in
this case with the 28
the silicon the actual GPU portion
itself is massive it's really big even
though it puts out a lot of heat that
area the surface area is actually quite
big so if you guys have suggestions on
what would be the smallest area for the
most highest heat output I'd love to
know because then that would create more
of a bottleneck in terms of the thermal
paste to the cooler and on that note I'd
like to have the cooler massive as well
so we do get these subtle differences
exposed even more I'm not sure if the 28
et I did the best job in today's
comparison but on that note I did set
the fan speeds to a hundred percent on
all these tests here to create an
apples-to-apples environment as well as
keeping the ambient temperatures at 25
degrees C so that's going to keep
everything within a controlled
environment and so we did see these
differences come out with these thermal
pace so it was very enlightening for me
you're gonna see now two new metas which
kind of sucks because in the last video
I did go out and buy a heap of GC
extreme but then I didn't realize
kingpin Cooling's thermal paste existed
and I didn't even know the GD 900
existed but of course if you have some
gel a GC extreme it's still gonna be
amazing for cooling down those
enthusiast parts and with that said I
hope you guys enjoyed today's video if
you did then just like I said before be
sure to slap a like on the video and if
you're enjoying the content that much
manage to subscribe hit that Bell
notification to get the videos the
moment they drop or if you want the
inside scoop be sure to check us out on
Instagram where I did post up a video of
all the wet tissues we went through the
alcohol wipes it was crazy the amount of
thermal paste we went through with this
video and just cleaning it up and
reapplying all the thermal paste just
took so long but it was worth it in the
end we did get the conclusion and the
results for you guys hope you enjoyed it
and with that said I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now babe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
