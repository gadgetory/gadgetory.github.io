prism Kula which was released with their
last year previous generation rise in
2000 chips namely the horizon 720 700 X
was easily the best included Box cooler
I have seen to date with any CPU having
the RGB bling and also having the
cooling performance however this time
around the risin 730 700 X and also all
the X CPU line up in the risin 3000
series chips include this cooler and so
especially coming in at a price point of
329 dollars for the 8 core 16 threaded
3700 X I decided to run some tests here
today where I'm comparing this cooler
against a 360 millimetre radiator on an
X 570 board as well as throwing in an x3
70 motherboard to see if you really need
to go out and spend that extra money on
a bigger and beefier cooler when it
comes to getting the most out of your 8
core 16 threaded chip I've also decided
to test out the 3900 X which is
currently the flagship desktop CPU from
AMD the 12 core option and they will be
releasing the 3950 X later this year but
the 3900 X also comes included with the
Wraiths prism so with the TDP coming in
at 125 watts it got me thinking how much
performance would you be losing if you
just stuck with this over going out and
spending your hard-earned on a bigger
more expensive cooler let's find out
welcome back to check yesterday without
wasting any more of your time we've
decided to run a few different tests
here at different settings first of all
I tested out the deep cool castle 360
mil water cooler this comes included
with three fans and they have improved
the design of this cooler especially
compared to deep pools previous water
coolers where I thought they're really
mediocre this one does an excellent job
of cooling as well as keeping the noise
down but that aside we decided to test
the precision boost overdrive to
settings where if you guys haven't seen
my review yet I'll put the link up here
basically the PBO two settings on the x5
70 motherboards was phenomenal to the
point where it finds the sweet spot for
your CPU automatically in terms of
single threaded and multi-threaded clock
speeds and it does an excellent job
basically my recommendation would be to
go out get one of these chips arise in
3000 CPUs put it in the next 570
motherboard and just have happy days but
what if you want to micro and say get a
cheaper motherboard like an X 370 or B
350 which does support the new matias if
you use and still use this race cooler
well let's pull up the results for you
guys first of all with the 3700 X we
managed to get Cinebench our xx scores
that were really close to each other
with the water cooler versus the ray
prism and then going over to the gaming
benchmarks far cry new dawn we had a
hundred and twenty average FPS versus a
hundred and twenty average fps
Tom Clancy's the division 2 did show a
slightly higher score but again this is
so negligible and it really makes the
argument for the r8 being an exceptional
value for money option with this CPU now
the all core clocks on an Ida 64 stress
test after 10 minutes we did see the old
core clock speeds on the 3700 X max out
to around 4.2 gigahertz where the
Wraiths prism that went down to around 4
point 1 to 5 gigahertz the power
consumption on both stayed around 90
watts the temperatures on the race did
go up to around 85 degrees whereas on
the castle they did go to 71 degrees so
there was a 14 degree difference and
also a seventy-five megahertz old boost
clock speed difference but really when
it comes down to
is it worth that extra 150 dollars for
something that really isn't that big of
a difference I'll let you guys be the
judge with that one but let's look up
next the race on the 3900 X where it
actually performed quite surprisingly
very similar to the 3700 X the gaming
benchmarks showed similar fps in Far Cry
New Dawn and moving over to Tom Clancy's
the division 2 we did get a slight FPS
boost on the watercooler by about 4
average fps
now in terms of temperatures they were
in favor of the water cooler by about 10
degrees where we maxed out at 81 degrees
and that had an all-call boost again of
roughly 4.2 gigahertz it does tend to
fluctuate however so it's very hard to
get an exact reading because that's how
PBO to boost works it's essentially
constantly changing the clock speeds on
you and in the case of the
single-threaded clock speeds they
managed to stay around the same speeds
we're on the Cinebench scores just like
we saw with the 3700 X they scored
roughly the same when it came to that
single core count score the all core
count score in the Cinebench are 20
scored only a hundred points less
however this is where things get a
little bit trickier because again once
we're running the Ida 64 stress test
over a 10-minute period we start to weed
out variants so we saw a four point zero
seven five or core clock speed on the
race spire versus a 4.2 gigahertz so on
the 3900 X it does start to make a
little bit more of a difference going
with an aftermarket cooling solution but
also keeping temperatures down where as
opposed to the race on the 3700 X the
differences were pretty negligible the
battle consumptions sweet spot on these
tests for the 3900 X did go around 135
watts we're on the race it topped out at
134 watts consumption then on the 3900 X
topped out at 136 watts so basically the
precision boost overdrive to works in a
number of factors it'll take into
account the temperatures the voltages
and also the clock speeds to quite
simply automatically find a sweet spot
for your current setup now I do believe
this also takes into account ambient
temperatures if you live in a hotter
climate or a cooler climate you
probably see different results to what
I've got here today but the last test I
decided to do with the race risen also
the 3700 X was put that in a budget X
370 motherboard this is the gigabyte
gaming k3 now I did have to update the
BIOS to the latest f40 revision but
after I did that everything booted up
smoothly it even supported the 36
hundred megahertz memory that I used was
CL 16 timings absolutely no problems
however I found it was a little bit
trickier in this BIOS because the
voltage adjustments were plus and minus
so they weren't as simple as whacking in
say for instance 1.3 6 volt which was
around about the sweet spot on a water
cooler for my 4.3 gigahertz or core
overclock on both the 3900 X and also
the 3700 X so the options were a bit
more limited on this budget motherboard
but I still managed to give it plus
point 1 volt and then lock in an old
core speed of 4.1 gigahertz and that ran
absolutely fine
scoring great temperatures and keeping
the power still pretty low for granted
the amount of power you have on 8 cores
and 16 threads and then moving over to
Far Cry new dawn and also Tom Clancy's
the FPS wasn't far behind that of the X
570 with precision boost overdrive to on
and do keep in mind I did test this out
with an r/t X 20 atti and these are in
CPU demanding titles so if you're gonna
go with the cookie cutter risin 730 700
X build and couple it with a cheaper
motherboard and maybe get two sticks of
3000 megahertz memory and go with the
mid-range graphics card you're basically
gonna notice next to no difference even
compared to that of a 9900 K in
practically any gaming title out there
so the value proposition of the race
cooler is really good whether you're
pairing it with an x5 70 motherboard or
going with a budget motherboard it's
awesome to see that AMD is just really
giving so much value not just in the
terms of the Zen 2 CPUs in the way of
performs and also the power efficiency
but also the included cooler is an extra
added bonus that will do a great job and
it's nothing to be afraid of I guess if
you're an enthusiast and you want the
latest and greatest but you still budget
orientated and that you want to save the
most amount of money possible
getting the CPU especially the 3700 X
with that included cooler and not have
to worry about going out and spending
extra money on a more expensive cooler
is a very solid option if you just want
to go with the Wraith prism and with
