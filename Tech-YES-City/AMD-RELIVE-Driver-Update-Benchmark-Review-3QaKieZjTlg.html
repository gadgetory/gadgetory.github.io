from AMD which addresses something that
I've been longing for not only that
it'll make you live again or relive
again depending on how you look at the
bike tech city this is brand coming to
you guys today with a recent massive
driver update that was announced from
AMD and they are calling it relive and
I'm calling it thanks it's finally here
update essentially you now have the
option to record your desktop and games
manually and also set your bit rates
from 1 megabit per second all the way up
to 50 megabits per second an FPS with
either option of 30 or 60 you can also
use the real if to stream to twitch
YouTube or other sites and there is an
option there to use different encoders I
opted to use the encoder built into the
GPU itself there is also the instant
replay feature which was very easy to
configure though if you do use this
feature just make sure you have a
heavy-duty disk drive ready for all that
recording and also it may introduce some
stuttering especially on underpowered
machines now some other features with
this software there is a thing called
HDMI link assurance which can apparently
detect faulty HDMI cables and I've
actually had a bad HDMI cable in the
past so something like this could save
me some time not too shabby
there is also now support for free sync
with borderless window mode so those who
have requested that shall receive and
lastly a big feature implemented into
this driver set is called the chill
feature which allows you to switch it on
with a global hotkey of f11 now there is
a limited amount of titles whitelisted
for this and this feature can reportedly
lower the final output times of frames
to your monitor and with that said it is
good to see three highly competitive
multiplayer games on that list csgo
World of Warcraft and overwatch that
could benefit competitive gamers in the
real world and I say could as I haven't
tested this yet and to be honest I don't
have the gear to accurately test this
though besides quick of frames the chill
feature also boasts power savings in the
promise to keep your GPU cooler so keep
in mind support for this chill feature
will be limited to GPUs that are only
supported by the global Whatman feature
that is the r7 260 and upwards anyway
that all sounds good on paper let's talk
about figures with my GPU overclocked to
the max I saw some minor increases in
both
Finnick warfare and also battlefield one
compared to the previous driver which
was good and then moving on to the chill
factor I noticed that this feature was
related to the actual processing
detection of input of either the
keyboard and all the mouse with infinite
warfare actually incurring a bug on my
own that stopped the mouse from moving
the character yet when moving the mouse
the game started shifting frames which
let this cat out of the bag instantly -
how it actually works great feature if
the postman is at your door you want to
save some micro sense on your power bill
or if you pass out frequently at the
computer also when using the HEV C
encoder versus not using it I didn't see
any performance drop great stuff though
I will have to do more testing here in
lastly 3d fire strikes saw a massive
increase from thirteen thousand one
hundred and thirty-two to fourteen
thousand and ninety one I might have to
double check this but that is a whopping
increase from just one driver update to
save the least so then we have it all in
all very impressive for the first
iteration of a massive driver overhaul
like relive and I didn't notice any
problems with the recordings and it was
really damn good except there were some
little annoyances for me like not being
able to hotkey function keys directly to
manual recording and also with the no
indicator option turned on there is
literally no indicator at all so you're
in the dark if you accidentally double
tapped and you are not sure if it is
recording or not I would like to see
them have the option for maybe like a
little red dot in the corner or
something though personally I think AMD
have been really on their game as of
late and I'm definitely loving this new
style of commitment we're seeing
performance gains cleaners software more
awesome added functionality this is
certainly more than just a driver update
folks this is life though seriously
all's I need now from AMD is that big
hitting 4k card and I'll be having a
good hard think about making that switch
to team red on my daily driver and you
guys let me know in the comments section
below what do you think of the new AMD
re live driver update would love to hear
your thoughts and opinions as always and
also don't forget to slam boozled that
like button and I'll catch you in the
next Tech video very soon peace out for
now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
