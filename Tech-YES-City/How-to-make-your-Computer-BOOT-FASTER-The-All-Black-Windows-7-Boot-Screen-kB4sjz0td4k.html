times lately a few people been asking
how do I get such fast-food times what
do I do to get these boot times I'm
going to show you guys today I'm also
going to detail some of the hardware I
have to get these fast boot times but
here let's have a look what do I do
I press the power button I build her up
so as you can see here guys there's no
fastboot settings enabled no fancy
settings it's just hit the but had that
power button and it jumps straight into
Windows and what happens here if you
guys watch closely is I have what I call
the all-black Windows boot so you see
there's no login screen there's no
welcome screen and it's my opinion just
looks awesome so I'm going to teach you
guys today how to get this fastboot and
what settings are using what tweaks are
using Windows and let's get on with it
so I'm going to be in the bottom right
corner here guiding you guys through
this gun and let's get on with the first
part so I want you two guys to click on
Start menu and type in disk defrag and
then I want you to click on disk
Defragmenter so that's right despite
popular belief SSDs can still suffer
from fragmentation so click here and as
you can see here mines 2% fragmented
look at that if you guys if it doesn't
have a percentage here you can click
analyze disk and it'll analyze it for
you and then you can click defrag now
I'm actually not going to defrag it on
this video because it'll interrupt my
recording or I believe it may so as you
see that defrag I want you guys to hit
that defrag your SSD so that actually
helps with boot times they can help get
rid of that annoying windows logon
screen so next by the built our next
public guide not build it's going to see
anyway advanced system settings Start
menu I want you guys to click on
advanced system settings click there and
now I want you guys to go to performance
so you can adjust this whichever way you
want but the main thing you want to do
is you want to go here to visual effects
and go to custom and you want to at
least make sure that Aero pikas is
disabled and also transparent glass
these two the main ones they do have a
little bit of a performance hitch which
can cost you a slightly sore give you a
slightly slower boot time anyway those
two disabled are the main things to look
out for
you guys feel free to copy my settings
if you wish to for this I've also got a
Windows 7 tweak guide which I will put
in the description below for you guys if
you wish to check that out but anyway
let's go onto Advanced tab over here now
another important thing you may wish to
do is go to virtual memory and hit
change now this next tip I only
recommend doing this if you honestly
have 16 gigabytes of RAM or more if you
only have a gigabytes of RAM or 4
gigabytes of RAM then you probably don't
want to do this what this is doing is
enable is disabling virtual memory which
when your memory gets full it'll use
some of your hard disks to store data on
and you know it can if you have this
disabled and you need more memory it can
slow down your computer quite a bit but
if you've got 16 gigabytes of RAM or
more then you can just hit no paging
file so you just here it will have here
this will be automatically checked I
want you to take off this tick here and
then hit no paging file and hit set and
what this will do is this will set no
paging file for you guys and so click
apply click ok so that's the first two
things I want you to do in the
performance option so click OK there now
the next thing now the another important
tab here in the Advanced tab is startup
and recovery I want you guys to go to
settings here and I want you guys to
make sure time to display list of
operating systems I want you to make
sure that option is unchecked so that'll
make boot time slightly more faster as
well so once you hit OK now the next
part is system protection now if you
need system protection then don't do
this next option but for a little bit of
a faster boot time I want you to take
system protection off your main boot
drive you can hear you as you can see
here I've got two more petitions here
they're not my SSD they're my actual
Western Digital hard drives as well yeah
I can actually turn system protection on
for these drives I'd actually don't need
system protection as I actually yeah I
mean I don't expose my computer to any
harmful viruses or anything like that
I've got another machine for doing that
but anyway if you want to turn this off
you can just go click here it'll have
the window symbol for your boot drive
click configure and you can just go turn
off system protection or you can set it
to a lower amount if you wish to so if
you go turn off system flashing click
okay and that will be that's so that's
it for the system properties there so we
can click okay that is now finished and
we go restart later because ain't
finished with this guide yet so restart
later now the last part of this guide is
I want you to type in here as I want you
to go to MS config so go to start menu
so I'll do that again hit Start menu
type in MS config and then click on this
here now this will bring up system
configuration so I should we got another
tip after this as well but this is the
second last tip anyway so we're going to
go to the boot tab up here and then we
want to go no GUI boot we want to make
sure that is ticked so basically this is
the most essential option for getting
that all-black boot screen what this
does is disables the Windows Start boot
up fancy start thing so that will get
rid of that and also give you a slightly
faster boot time as well next thing I
want you to do is go to services and
click hide all Microsoft services as
generally the Microsoft services are
important for your system to even run so
you click hard all Microsoft services go
to running and you can check out which
services are running as you see here
I've disabled three services here the
Adobe Acrobat services which I don't
need and also my qualcomm atheros killer
service which I don't need as well the
Steam client service I do keep that
running as I find if I disable it it
actually messes with my games and with
Steam when I want to play so next so
once you've done that once you disabled
all the services you don't need you can
then go to startup and do the same for
this disable all the programs that you
don't need and as you can see here I
have quite a few programs that are not
running I've disabled my real tech
that's notable noticeable one of also
disable my Qualcomm and my Logitech
webcam software as well as all these
adobe startup and update services the
programs that little lead to an update
service so I want you guys to do that
and click OK
now the not last part so exit without
restart again now the last part of the
guide is going to be the command prompt
so I want you to go to Start menu type
in command go to command prompt right
click on it and go run as administrator
so this is pretty important you got to
run
administrator if you don't run this at
administrator this next tip won't work
and I want you to type in here I want
you guys to type in power CFG / H off so
what this will do is this will turn off
hibernation which will free up SSD space
so will system protection as well if you
free up if you take off system
protection and basically this just helps
create less of a load on windows when
it's first loading up so that'll help
slightly with boot times as well anyway
that's it for the guide so that's the
last part that's the last step of the
guide finished for you guys and I'll
pull up to the big screen here so I hope
you enjoyed this guide now for hardware
hardware is crucial of course the faster
your hardware is the faster your boot
time is going to be so if you have for
me I have a 4 670 K running at 4.6 gigs
however keep in mind that even my Intel
3 570 K at Auto saw 3 point 4 gigs with
a Corsair for 3 I still managed to get
the all-black boot screen so hardware is
important but it's not you don't need
the fastest machine on earth to get all
black boot screen so if you guys have a
3 5 70 K even a 4 even like an FX 6300
clock to four gigs she'll be capable of
getting the all-black boot screen an SSD
is crucial though you will need an SSD
to get that all-black boot screen I
haven't done it on my hard drives yet
maybe and maybe four of them rated raid
zero together might be capable but I
don't know anyway I've put my hardware
in the description below for you guys
I've also put a link to my Windows 7
tweak go for you guys and if you like
this video please give it a thumbs up
and if you haven't really subscribe I'll
be coming back to you guys with some
more awesome videos and if you have any
questions or comments please leave a
comment the comment section below and
I'll catch you guys soon sorry I had to
remake this video as I remade it I made
it before but it had audio issues when I
was was rendering the video here he goes
