yesterday's baronies coming back to you
guys today with a quick unboxing and
preview of the intel i5 4670k now this
is what you get with the box this is the
retail version now one good thing about
Intel products is they come boxed
extremely well and they also come with
the factory seal so if yours does not
have the factory seal I would just say
look take you back to the socks and say
why did you open this if it doesn't work
I mean it's just yet the factory still
gives you that sense of knowing that
your product has not been tampered with
now you get the same crappy Intel
heatsink as with all other until
products so you get the same really i
think it's even thinner than the last
gen the Ivy Bridge is heat sink so this
thing is really small I think it's even
lighter I mean it does feel a little bit
lighter than last gen in Ivy bridge's so
that's the house well cool they're
really really thin now you get a little
manual with it and also a little decal
the inside core i5 intel so does it does
look right i mean people having like
people like well the box it means just
the box he really cares i mean comes
with the so anyway thing to note about
this is it comes with the intel HD 4600
graphics which i'm not really buying
this chip for i'm buying it for the fact
that it I believe it's soldered to the
the this ti mne is soldered to the chip
this time so you're going to be able to
get better over clocks with this chip so
this is a opening the chip here this is
what you get so here's the chip here it
looks a little bit different on the LGA
1150 so i will get a close-up for you
guys now right up here ok so here is the
chip itself this is a close-up of it now
it's a it's just it looks pretty much
the same as the Ivy Bridge I think a
little bit different definitely it looks
a little bit different think it's
actually got a smaller tire and this
time around so looking at the back of
the chair got to be very careful with it
it does look pretty beautiful man yeah
so there it is guys that's the Haswell
chip that's what you get with the 46 70
k so this is a little bit cheaper than
the i7 4770k it's got 6 megabytes of
cash
so you will sort of I don't know if this
is the value King I think it is for a
gamer this is definitely the way to go
you know in Japan you have to pay an
extra hundred and twenty dollars for
hyper threading and then extra two
megabytes of cash so anyway I'm going to
test this thing i'm going to overclock
it and i'm going to put some links in
the description below when i get my
obviously make the overclocking videos
and i'm going to compare it to the 35 70
k with the few tests and i'll see how
that guy's if they see how well that
goes so guys if you enjoyed this little
unboxing and preview of the 3 4 6 70 k
then please give this a thumbs up and if
you haven't read east obscure around to
take your city and i'll be back with
more reviews unboxings and overclocking
tutorials especially for this little
beast here so i guess peace out for now
brain is your bait I'll catch you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
