yesterday's Barone's coming back to you
guys today with a quick unboxing and
preview of the Intel i5 for 670 K now
this is what you get with the box this
is the retail version now one good thing
about Intel products is they come boxed
extremely well and they also come with
the factory seal so if yours does not
have the factory seal I would just say
look take it back to the Sox and say why
did you open this if it doesn't work I
mean it's just yeah the factory still
gives you that sense of knowing that
your product has not been tampered with
now you get the same crappy intel
heatsink as with all other intel
products so you get the same really I
think there's even thinner than the last
gen the Ivy Bridge is heatsink so this
thing is really small I think it's even
lighter I mean it does feel a little bit
lighter than last gen in Ivy bridges so
that's the house well cooler they're
really really thin now you get a little
manual with it and also a little decal
the inside core i5 Intel so it does it
does look right I mean people having
like people like well of the box I mean
it's just a box he really cares I mean
comes with the so anyway thing to note
about this is it comes with the intel HD
4000 600 graphics which i'm not really
buying this chip for i'm buying it for
the fact that it I believe it's soldered
to the the this ti M is soldered to the
chip this time so you're going to be
able to get better overclocks with this
chip so this is uh opening the chip here
this is what you get so here's the chip
here it looks a little bit different on
the LGA 1150 so I will get it closed up
for you guys now right up here okay so
here's the chip itself this is a close
up of it now it's a it's just it looks
pretty much the same as the Ivy Bridge I
think a little bit different definitely
it looks a little bit different I think
it's actually got a smaller Ti and this
time around so looking at the back of
the chip I'm gonna be very careful with
it it does look pretty beautiful man
yeah so there it is guys that's the
Haswell chip that's what you get with
the for 670 k so this is a little bit
cheaper than the i7 4770k it's got six
megabytes of cache
so you will sort of I don't know if this
is the value King I think it is for a
gamer this is definitely the way to go
you know in Japan you have to pay an
extra hundred and twenty dollars for
hyper-threading and then extra two
megabytes of cash so anyway I'm gonna
test this thing I'm gonna overclock it
and I'm gonna put some links in the
description below when I get my
obviously make the overclocking videos
and I'm gonna compare it to the three
five 70k with the few tests and I'll see
how that guys if they see how well that
goes so guys if you enjoyed this little
unboxing and preview of the three four
six seven TK then please give this a
thumbs up and if you haven't reached so
to screw around to take your city and
I'll be back with more reviews unboxings
and overclocking tutorials especially
for this little beast here
so I guess peace out for now bronies you
by I'll catch you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
