their RX 570 though how does it compare
against an RX 470 in the real world well
today I'm going to be taking a look at
this gravis card and comparing it with
gigabytes own rx 470 and seeing the
differences in the real world welcome
back to tech city this is brand coming
to you guys today with the benchmarks
and comparison that y'all have been
waiting for well at least hopefully
you've been waiting for it so today I'm
comparing the rx 570 which boosted up to
fourteen hundred and sixty five
megahertz on the core and also two
thousand one hundred and fifty megahertz
on the memory and now in gaming this did
give it a sizable boost over the RX 470
which in this case managed to clock up
to thirteen hundred and eighty four
megahertz on the core and also just got
over 2,000 megahertz which is of course
quadrupled into 8000 megahertz effective
on the memory so these two clock speeds
let's get into the benchmark and then
we'll talk about the differences the
first benchmark we're going to take a
look at is Far Cry primal with the RX
470 the average frame rates were 61 fps
and 48 on the minimum and then on the RX
570 that scored 66 average with a 52
minimum so the gains were would be seen
here with an 8% difference on this
benchmark tomb Raider's inbuilt
benchmark eternity beyond very high
settings with the dx11 api scored 73
average FPS on the RX 470 and comparing
that to the RX 570 that's good
78 average FPS so there was a difference
of 7% the minimums were pretty much the
same with only 2 FPS being the variable
factor there moving on to the f1 2016
benchmark at 1080p on the ultra high
settings with SMA and abled we saw 74
average FPS on the RX 470 with a minimum
of 57 and comparing that to the RX 570
we saw quite a sizable boost here with
85 average fps and a minimum of 63 so
this was the biggest difference in all
these benchmarks scoring in 14% higher
moving onto Metro last light on very
high settings at 1080p we scored a
100 average FPS here on the RX 470 with
a minimum of 33 versus the RX 570 which
scored 108 average FPS with a minimum of
34 so there wasn't much different than
the minimums here and the average FPS
was on higher 8% moving under the last
game we have is for honor and this
scored on the RX 470 77 average FPS with
a minimum of 57 contrast that to the RX
570 that's good 83 average FPS with a
minimum of 58 so there wasn't a
difference in the minimums really here
but there was an 8% difference in the
average fps and now the last benchmark
we have up here is 3dmark fire strike
which on the GPU score we sought 13,500
and three on the RX 470 and comparing
that to the RX 570 we had 14 thousand
four hundred and sixty seven points so
there was a boost of about seven percent
though here's where things start to take
an interesting turn when I clocked these
cards at the exact same speeds with the
exact same benchmark on fire strike the
previous variant the RX 470 scorpion
with 12,000 653 GPU score versus the RX
570 which scored in with 12,000 471
points so the exact same settings with
the exact same clock speeds in the exact
same benchmark the RX 470 actually came
out ahead now here's the kicker this is
where things get really weird is that
the RX 470 actually used a lot less
power whilst doing so and even with the
overclock settings I managed to measure
the maximum wattage consumed out of both
these cards when you overclock them
because let's face it if we're getting
these graphics cards with custom coolers
on them a lot of people are going to
want to overclock so here's where the
Auris card actually performed quite
fully assualt a maximum power draw of
202 watts comparing that with the RX 470
from gigabyte it scored only 123 Watts
max power consumed the idols were a
little bit in favor of the rx 570
however with 5 Watts versus a twat but
you may be wondering why is there such a
big difference in the power consumption
well this has to do with the refresh of
the cards themselves
I've noticed in the BIOS here that you
get an extra 80 millivolts Headroom on
the RX 570 versus the rx or 70 but the
max voltage enabled on
bu quantified 70 being 1.24 volt versus
the RX 470 which has a maximum of one
point one six goals so you may be
wondering about temperatures and here's
a good thing with the Auris card I
managed to clock in 66 degrees maximum
see on the heaven benchmark after
running for 30 minutes versus the RX 470
which clocked in at 68 maximum
temperature in a 25 degree ambient
environment so there was a two degree
favor in favor of the Auris card even
with that higher power consumption this
was with fan speeds of 80%
so on that note of fan speeds I find
eighty percent to be quite the sweet
spot when overclocking this card without
putting out a whole lot of noise however
compared to a hundred percent it does
sound quite different I'll let you guys
take a listen
so all the refresh on the RX 570
generally means higher clock speeds
however at the cost of higher power
consumption whether that's the thing for
you is up to you of course the end user
I found that the rx 570 however did give
you that extra 7 to 14 percent
performance boost depending on the game
or the benchmark and it was quite
pleasing to see that there were
performance increases with this refresh
of the RX series cards they give my
Taurus card it's very solid it runs
pretty cool and the temperatures are
really good at the same time so I can't
fault anything on this card in terms of
how it performs also with that note the
price currently at the moment for the
Auris card is around about 212 USD
contrasting that to the RS 470 from
gigabyte which currently can be picked
up for around about 190 USD so with that
said I would like to see it come down
slightly in price just to make it more
competitive especially versus the
previous rx for 70s also the Auris card
features RGB lighting on the side of the
card which can be changed by a software
and has various different modes as well
you can use this software to overclock
your graphics card and monitor various
things whilst you're playing games the
graphics card also has a metal backplate
with a dedicated copper portion there
which is supposed to help with
overclocking and performance though I
found with the 1080 Ti or if it didn't
make a difference at all
and lastly looking at the rear input and
output of this card you get one hdmi 3
DisplayPort and one DVI out so all in
all the Auris 570 is a solid little card
at overclocks really well and the
temperatures remain pretty cool whilst
doing so however in a comparison with
the RX 470 versus the 570 directly there
really isn't a huge difference there's
no reason to go out and buy a 570 if you
already have a 470 though if the price
is right and you are looking for a new
graphics card especially in the
mid-range section then the Auris 570 is
a great graphics card that I can highly
recommend though as always I'll catch
you guys in another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
