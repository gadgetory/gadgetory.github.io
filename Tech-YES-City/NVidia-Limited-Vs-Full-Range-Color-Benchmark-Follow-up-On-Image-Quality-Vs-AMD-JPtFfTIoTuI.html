at AMD versus nvidia in terms of image
quality that's coming out of your screen
now we had a 4k sony a7s 2 and on this
setup there were some subtle differences
and when we zoomed in pixel by pixel we
could notice that the AMD graphics card
overall I thought had slightly better
detail and the main determining factor
of this was when we looked at static
objects so yes we did capture this with
a sony a7s 2 but we did have it in a
controlled environment where the
settings were exactly the same the
position of the cameron was exactly the
same and also the position of the
monitor was exactly the same and now the
reason we didn't use a capture card for
this is because capture cards expose
themselves essentially to compression of
their own especially at 1080p we're not
gonna get a accurate result whatsoever
in my opinion if we use a 4k caption car
then we may get some better results but
again a 4k CAPTCHA card will still
expose itself to some form of
compression so I guess the idea is that
we've sort of want to open Pandora's box
in regards to this because I know
there's a difference when we looked at
it with the current setup we had and
then we looked at it with our own eyes
going back and forth both I and also my
Video Editor use of we could notice a
slight difference it was there and so if
someone out there has may be really
expensive gear like an 8k camera and an
8k monitor and they've got completely
lossless maybe they can do a video
comparison or they can get some really
high res photos on an even better gear
I'd like to see if there's an expert out
there on visuals that could sort of
weigh in on this but other than that
we're also taking a look at the settings
that we used initially and that was on
the Nvidia graphics cards that sometimes
with particular monitors and that's what
we've found around here we've got over 6
different monitors that we tested this
on half of the monitors defaulted to a
setting called limited range and you
have to change this not only I made a
little mistake in yesterday's video and
where I said it was the video glare
settings but it's also a resolution
setting as well that you can change the
dynamic output and make sure that that's
going the full dynamic range and so
today we're doing some tests here as
well this is with the capture car
because you're going to easily capture
differences in color when you look at
these two settings and so what we
decided to do was use the default
setting on a HP monitor that we had here
which defaults to limited and then we
decided to test that versus full range
and what we had was a clear difference
in my opinion in overwatch the colors
were a little bit more washed out
especially on the wooden floors you
could notice it there and then moving
over to Far Cry 5 when we tested this
side-by-side the water was definitely
looking a lot more washed out than it
was on the full range mode and then move
over the last game that we tested was
Rainbow six siege and that again had
washed out colors versus the full range
mode so if you guys have an Nvidia card
it doesn't hurt to go into the control
panel and then just go to your
resolution settings make sure it's
defaulting to full range if it isn't
then you can go to the Advanced Options
and then click full range and then lock
that in because monitors for a very long
time now have supported full range I
believe some monitors back in the day
didn't support this feature but I think
a lot of years later this maybe should
be an option that Nvidia asked people
are you using an old monitor if so do
you want to change this setting because
it does make a big difference I feel
like you're getting a better image when
you're using full range it's not so
washed up but also on top of that as we
said in yesterday's video the image
quality differences between the Nvidia
and also the AMD graphics cards it's not
a big deal I am just being pretty anal
retentive about this stuff and sort of
going into details but I do like to do
that from time to time on the channel
and I do like to also discuss with you
guys in the comments on different things
that we can try and also different
methods that we can get help as a
community grow and become more
knowledgeable so I don't pretend to know
everything and I'm far from knowing
everything there is about the lousiest
tech but always try to weigh in and sort
of give my opinion on things especially
when I go from testing different
graphics cards from one brand to another
and speaking of AMD vs. NVIDIA I've
actually been using Nvidia graphics
cards in my main rig for over six years
straight now so when it comes to fanboy
ISM arguments I don't
really get involved in any of that I
just simply do tests and then make
recommendations for people and I always
say get what is best for you and I will
say in a lot of my reviews maybe what is
best for me in my current situation but
everyone out there in the world is
different they've got different needs
and if even subtle differences in image
quality is one of those needs that you
have
then perhaps getting the AMD card is the
right choice for you also another
question that came up in the comments
was turning on limited range versus full
range does it affect FPS and at least in
Rainbow six siege the in-game benchmark
and also Far Cry 5 those benchmarks
showed no difference whatsoever with the
RT X 2070 now there's also another good
question that came up and that was Delta
color compression is there a way to
disable this and unfortunately to my
knowledge no because it's a hardware
based solution that hidden video have
been implementing on their graphics
cards and apparently they've improved it
with the RT X 2008 ested the RT X 2070
versus the rx 590 so in terms of trying
to disable this I'd have no idea
whatsoever on how you would even disable
this if it's possible anyway what all
comes down to it it is what it is and we
just try and do our best to give you
guys the best informed purchasing
decision and right now it's all over the
place there's gonna be a lot more
content to come whether it be used parts
new parts so stay tuned make sure you
hit that like button if you enjoyed
today's video and if you have any
thoughts and opinions of your own about
today's video yesterday's video then
make sure you drop a comment in the
comment section below as I love reading
those thoughts opinions as always and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now peace out
for now bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
