not recommending this graphics card
right here this is the P 106 which is a
mining variant of the gtx 1066 gigabyte
it came with pretty much all the same
hardware at the base level except there
was some key differences the most
notably being the no display options or
in cases of some of these cards limited
display options at the rear of the card
but at the core it was also AP 106 on a
firmware level and this mean there was a
different card in its makeup and that it
wasn't intended for gaming and strictly
for mining so the benefit to these cards
at the time was that they were cheaper
for miners to bulk buy brand new off the
shelves as opposed to the gtx 1066
gigabytes which had options that -
simply didn't need but in hindsight i
believe they probably should have bought
those 1060 gaming editions because the
resale value of these is simply terrible
compared to the gaming variant anyhow
fast-forward a few months and we're
going to be putting this card back on
the test bench and trying to get it to
work properly and seeing the conclusion
on whether you should buy one or not but
also linus did make a video after I made
my initial video where he did get this
to work and the thing I really liked
about that video was that linus did
prove a point and that was if in-video
wanted these to work they could
definitely allow them to work in the
hands of gamers but at least with the
Nvidia that we all know this probably
wasn't going to be a possibility simple
reason being money regardless of that
let's take this P 106 put it on the test
bench and try to get it working in a
variety of titles including apex legends
but before we do get on with testing the
P 106 have you ever been targeted by a
hacker if you haven't then you actually
may haven't you just haven't known about
it with today's video sponsor Nord VPN
you can now protect yourself on the
Internet
basically how a VPN works is that you
connect with your ISP to the VPN and
then from there no one can see your true
IP address which protects your identity
online and also on top of that it
protects your data from the ISPs since
it does encrypt the data on the way back
that means you are now completely safe
in an on
this on the internet which will help you
protect yourself against those predators
and the best news is Nord VPN are
offering tackiest City viewers 75% off
if you sign up via Nord VPN comm slash
tech yes City you'll also get a free
month included making it only $2.99 a
month I've tried this service it checks
out the speeds are really good they've
got multiple servers worldwide and the
best thing is it's quick and easy to set
up links in description below let's get
back to that P 106
so now finished the testing and there's
some good and bad news with the P 106
and first of all big shout-out to the
Linus tech tips forums the users in
there like Anthony and also a user named
are trading these guys know this stuff
and in the case of Darr trading he made
a very easy workaround there is the
easiest stuff found a date and the good
thing about it is you don't have to turn
off any test signing or anything like
that so this will work with competitive
multiplayer titles in the case of the P
106 I had here actually got two of them
here I managed to get it working on dota
2 csgo and also Tom Clancy's Rainbow six
siege with really good fps and nothing
was working out of the ordinary however
the bad news with this is this fix is
only available up until the four 17.2 to
driver after that Nvidia crack down on
it and stopped allowing it to work and
it's a very easy fix all you have to do
to get it to work is download that
official driver and then simply delete a
registry key disable and then re-enable
this device and then in your graphics
settings from windows make the
application high-performance mode so it
can then utilize the GPU power I'll put
the link in the description below for
dart raids video where he shows it in a
simple step-by-step manner anyway all
that aside this mining card right here
it can work and it can work well cobble
with certain CPUs and motherboards and
this is where the bad news is going to
begin because even on the forum and that
thread alone there's people reporting
the second and third gen Intel CPUs this
fix won't work and then there's also
another report of Zeus fourth generation
motherboards not working so apparently
in order to get this fixed to work you
have to have a fourth gen Intel CPU or
better any pre raisin APU this won't
work on as well as second and third gen
Intel CPUs also on top of that since
Nvidia have stopped making this work on
the newest drivers it then raises the
question of support for newer titles
when I went back and tested Apex legends
it ran horribly the screen blacked out
at times and also the FPS was all over
the place to the point where it just
wasn't a smooth experience so for anyone
out there that wants to get awesome used
price
performance and just play apex legends
with their friends I'd recommend you
seriously consider getting an rx 570
which can be had for very cheap at the
moment on the used market but now it's
time to go back and reference my
original video where I tried to get this
working and I did get it working up
until the stage where I was using the
unsigned driver and I tried to load up
Rainbow six siege and that stopped
working and then I loaded up dota 2 and
it was working for like ten seconds and
then it dropped out and I could no
longer get the card working again so I
based my recommendation on that video to
the fact that you were just going to
have nothing but problems fast-forward a
few months and there is a much easier
fix that will allow you to play the
older multiplayer titles with ease but
if you want to play newer titles that's
where you're going to come into some
problems because the drivers support has
been locked out by Nvidia from for 17.2
to so that now leaves me with a
recommendation that pretty much doesn't
differ a whole lot to that original
video and in Linus's video he said as
well he strictly doesn't recommend
anyone go out and do this it was just
simply to prove a concept and as we said
in the intro that was that it could work
if Nvidia wanted it to work and clearly
NVIDIA doesn't want this to work simply
because they probably want to sell new
graphics cards and there's a lot of
these on the used market but that being
said if you are in an extreme budget you
want to get the most value for money
possible and you don't want to play
titles that were released in 2019
onwards then this may be an option worth
considering however do keep in mind that
any configuration is not guaranteed if
this could work as we saw in that thread
a lot of people were reporting various
issues with different hardware
configurations some people got it to
work flawlessly and in the case of
today's video I managed on my current
configuration to get it working but
that's a XIII 90 motherboard with a 9900
Kay so your mileage may vary and with
that said I'd tread lightly with these
graphics cards I've also used two
different p1o sixes in today's videos so
you don't have to go and buy one off
Taobao to get this to work they don't
need to be custom modern and in fact I
believe Tom's Hardware in Germany tried
to get an external bleep bios programmer
and try and flash on a gtx 1066 gigabyte
to which they kind of
didn't really succeed it was still ap
106 at the course so it's almost
impossible to change these into a GTX
1060 and also if you're into reselling
PCs then I wouldn't consider this an
option you're potentially giving someone
a lot of headaches especially when this
gravity are dried here as we said before
the RX 5 70s and 4 70s they can be had
for very cheap I'll leave some links in
the description below for you guys and I
hope you enjoyed today's video if you
did then be sure to hit that like button
and also let us know in the comment
section below what you think of the P
106 and Nvidia locking this graphics
card out love reading your thoughts and
opinions as always and I'll catch you
guys in another tech video very soon but
also don't forget to check out today's
video sponsor Nord VPN where you get a
special discount for tech your city
viewers links in description below and
I'll catch you in the next one peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
