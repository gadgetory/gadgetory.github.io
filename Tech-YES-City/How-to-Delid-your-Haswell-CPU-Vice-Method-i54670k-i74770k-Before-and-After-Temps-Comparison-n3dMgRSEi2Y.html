yesterday's run easy coming back to you
guys today with a quick video on
deleting has well now this is the has
little chip here as you can see it's
deleted so I just did it I was really
nervous so device method is great like
it took me two seconds to do this just
grab a vise put some little electrical
tape there as to grip the heatsink
better and just put the heatsink in
there and have a little bit of the chip
sticking out here and just have
something in the background to catch the
chip and what I did was I just got this
little block of wood here this is little
block of wood a little sort of rubber
hammer any hammer will do just make sure
you're very careful and you just put it
on the edge there and you just bang bang
bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang
bang bang bang and yeah she comes off
like that beautiful and as you can see
all there's all this craps like the
actual the tea I am they use here is
just complete rubbish like I just yell
surprise with the like just the crap
they use on this is just absolute junk
so I mean if they're going to do this
paste why don't they just use onyx
silver or something I mean cost them you
know I'd rather pay an extra dollar for
my chip to have cymatics silver on it or
something anyway
I'm going to apply some new paste here
with the line method I'm then going to
put my cooler my chip back on and you
don't need to glue it back on you just
whack it back on the bracket will hold
it in place and I'm going to show you
before and after temps hey guys let's
get onto the before and off the temps
alright so on the left here I did a
benchmark prime95 and real temp and I
got 73 Max and 71 68 65 and that was a
six-minute benchmark and then on the
right I just did another quick
six-minute benchmark and this was exact
same ambient temps at 25 degrees ambient
temperature and you can see here the
there was a 6 degree difference so
encore one six degree difference encore
two and the other cause were a bit more
a little bit less but more even so as
you can see there when I did take the
screen shot you just see the temps of
way more even on the on the deal it at
after you deal it and put some arctic
silver 5 on
so yeah guys I can highly recommend this
method and I'll just move on to the
conclusion now so let's move on
conclusion I will say that the temps
dropped by about seven degrees and yeah
that's keep in mind that's with a fresh
paste of Arctic silver on there so maybe
a week later it will be you know even
lower so I will say that the temps were
more even as well across all the cores
which is great so all in all I'm going
to recommend this method the vise method
I'm not going to recommend the razor
blade method because I myself am too
nervous to do that like I if I get a
razor blade in there now I got rough
hands really rough hands if I did the
razor blade method I think I would have
bricked my chip for sure anyway guys in
conclusion I will say like you know I
don't have much muscle but I do have a
bit of muscle like a little bit so I
gotta say if you're scrawny like no bull
like no bull you guys probably
laughing but I'm yeah if you are scrawny
and you're nervous then maybe get
someone else to do it maybe your pup's
or you you know you friend who goes down
the gym or whatnot because you know if
you do have the hammer and you know
you'll just go bang bang bang and you've
got no power and your hammer
you know you overstep the wood or the
hammer and you you hit you know you just
hit the chip somehow you're going to
damage the chip because they're pretty
easy to damage so keep that in mind so
that's all I'm going to say in
conclusion guys and if you have any
questions or comments please leave a
comment in the comment section below
or if it's urgent PM me and I do
recommend the vise method like seriously
so I added like a vise sitting around I
had a hammer and just a block of wood
already there so I was like when I saw
this vise method like this is perfect so
yeah it was really it took like an hour
the whole process took an hour to do I
highly recommend it also another thing
is I sorry I did say the line method
before I do recommend the spread method
instead because of the voltage regulator
being right next to the chip so that's
another thing but yeah guys all in all
I'm going to be going for that 4.8
gigahertz overclock probably when it
gets a bit cooler this was with 25
degrees ambient amps as I said before
and yeah guys if you like this video
please give it a thumbs up and if you
haven't read subscribe to take care City
and I'll give you giving you guys some
more tech alright guys peace out bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
