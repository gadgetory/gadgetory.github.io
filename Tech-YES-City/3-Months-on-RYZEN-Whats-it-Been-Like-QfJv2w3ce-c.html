nearly every video is a rising system
and I built this on the channel about
three months ago and today I want to
talk about what it's been like to use
this thing not only for productivity in
making videos for you guys but also for
gaming over this time period and talk
about all the benefits and if there are
any little pet peeves I'll talk about
them as well welcome back to tag yes it
is brain and first off risin 7 this is
the 1800 X of clock this 2 4 gigahertz
now I'm using this coupled with 64
gigabytes of ddr4 memory and for my
personal rig I use two hard drives - 3
terabyte Seagate in raid 1 and also 0 so
I petitioned the drives off I have a
raid 0 portion for all made games and I
have a lot of games so I need a lot of
storage and I like to have it faster
than a single hard drive and also SSD
space costs a lot so raid 0 is still a
viable option for SATA 3 drives
however SSDs I used - at the moment I
have an nvme m2 it's a 500 gigabyte I
use this as a scratch drive for editing
videos and 4k videos can get quite large
so a drive like this performs consistent
and it is really good and then for my
main storage in my main boot drive I
usually one terabyte SSD from Corsair as
well the one to that main question of
have there been any problems in the last
three months and not really I mean there
has been some minor quirks the first
thing I can think of is my Elgato
capture card which I run to all my
benchmark pcs that does have some
intermediate problems where it does cut
out and sometimes it just straight up
doesn't work actually recorded some
video footage where I've never seen this
before it's still giving out the signal
to the monitor but it's still flickering
inside windows so there are some
compatibility issues with the elgato
capture card but for the most part it
does work well most of the time also on
a really rare occasion I will get a USB
port that will cause the computer to
crash and then I'll have to restart and
also probably my last test peeve with it
is that sometimes it does take a long
time to boot if you are using a raid
configuration like I am so besides those
things Verizon 7 has been extremely
awesome for using as a workstation you
can just do anything it's 8 cos 16
threads so you can render a video and
then multitask and do other things while
that video is rendering and not know
practically any slowdowns at all and
also on that note the gaming performance
is very good it's not as good as a 7700
K but on that note I do play at 1440p
ultra wide so I do need graphical power
more so than CPU power and rosin seven
does provide a really good balance but
what about going from a 6800 K that was
clocked to 4.3 gigahertz do a 7700 K
levels clock to 5 gigahertz then to
Rison which is clocked at 4 gigahertz
but when it comes down to what the
applications that I need this thing for
the rosin 7 1700 in my opinion does
perform slightly better than the 6800
candle so the 7700 K in the Adobe
Premiere Pro suite at least in Premiere
Pro when it comes to final render times
and also dropping in videos from your
scratch Drive to the actual program
itself the rosin 7 is very fast so
here's where the best part comes in with
the horizon 7 CPUs now although I do use
a rather than 1800 X which is their
review sample I'll sent out I all the
time recommend the Rison 7 1700 and a
lot of times when I talk about writing 7
I'm always just talking about writing
1700 because it's such good value for
money if I had absolutely no tech in my
living room and I had to go out and buy
a CPU motherboard combo rosin 7 780 350
motherboard would be where it was at for
me as you can get this CPU for around
300 dollars or even less and that's huge
for an eight-core 16 threaded CPU that
goes to 4 gigahertz and it also has
really good i pc I think AMD has done
everyone a favor with the rise in lineup
and they provide exceptionally good
value for money and of course months
later with bias updates and also patches
in Windows resin is now performing
extremely well I'm not noticing any
hiccups in games I'm not noticing any
performance numbers that are odd and
also it's rock-solid
when it comes to doing a lot of the
workstation stuff there are those pet
peeves I mentioned before but really
after three months I'm glad to say that
Rison is a solid choice for people who
want to use it as a workstation and I
can highly recommend it especially if
you are a value conscious consumer
though I know a big question coming in
from here is what about changing over 2
X 3 9 9 or X 299 from Intel are you
going to do that Brian and the answer is
maybe I mean honestly I don't need to
change over my workflow at the moment
I'm really comfortable with
and I think that's the question you have
to ask yourself as a tech enthusiast at
what level are you comfortable with your
gear I know for instance when I was
using the 7700 K to my workflow as
opposed to the road and seven 1700 there
wasn't much of a difference there wasn't
a world of difference one did slightly
better in gaming the other did better in
productivity
I wouldn't for example be only getting
out to videos on a 7700 key setup versus
a resin setup where I beginning out
three videos that wouldn't be the case
I'd still be getting out three videos a
week on both PCs and I think if I switch
to X 2 9 9 or X 3 9 9 I don't think my
workflow would be increased that much
more I mean maybe save a few minutes
here and there so another thing I want
to touch on is the temperatures with
Verizon has it been hard to handle or
has it been a hard CPU to keep under
control I mean I've got this thing at 4
gigahertz all day every day at 1.4 volt
now I keep this under control with a
corsair h 110 liquid cooler and honestly
even at the lowest fan speeds this thing
just never gets hot I can touch the
radiator at any time even when I'm
rendering out a big video or playing
games for long hours and the CPU just
remains really cool all the time and I
think in ways this is to thank for the
fact that AMD soldered the IHS to the
day unlike some of the competitors
anyway guys if you enjoyed today's video
then be sure to hit that like button and
also consider subscribing if you like
the content and hit that notification
tail if you want to get the video
notification instantly and also the case
I'm using is the air 740 from Corsair
it is just such a good case in terms of
air flow and also low noise and also it
looks really cool as well hey guys I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
