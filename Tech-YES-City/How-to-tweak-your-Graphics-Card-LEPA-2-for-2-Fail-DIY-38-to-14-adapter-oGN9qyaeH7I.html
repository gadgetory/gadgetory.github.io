bran he's coming back to you guys today
with some relaxed gameplay footage /
heroes of newerth and today I wanted to
talk to you guys about graphics cards
and the right settings because I've been
getting asked a lot of questions with my
in regards to my benchmarks and how do I
get such high frame rates and that has
to do with a few things but when i first
started benchmarking games on my gtx 670
i had 120 hertz monitor and basically i
would want to get 120 FPS on any game
regardless of the settings because I
loved the fluid motion of 120 Hertz
however when I started tweaking with
settings I noticed that there was a lot
of settings in games that really you
didn't need to have them set to the max
and they really had a huge impact on
your frame rate so we're talking like
twenty ten twenty percent and basically
I didn't make the game look much better
anyhow the first thing I'm going to talk
to you guys about its anti-aliasing or a
setting in your graphics settings called
MSAA and now this setting essentially it
makes the game look smoother the higher
you set this I think usually 88 times as
the max however the high you set this
the better it makes all this more I
guess the more smoother of a picture
takes away the jaggies on the picture
makes the game look smoother and it is a
good setting however I find it has a
real big diminishing return after your
four times and the difference if you go
from four times to eight times and you
can test this on any game you'll notice
that the frame rates will will drop a
heap if you go from four speed 28 speed
MSAA now I usually have this setting
around to speed or I use a setting
called SMAA so essentially SMAA is a
guess it's a better version of MSA I
love to use it as it looks just as good
as to speed or four speed msaa however
it just it doesn't have the performance
hit of either to speed or four speed so
it's a good setting if games support
SMAA i recommend you turn on SMAA
however if they don't then I usually
stick with trusty old MSAA on two or
four speed so that's the first setting
you guys should watch I mean if you've
got a graphics card like a gtx 780
or a gtx 780ti r9 290x and you generally
don't have to worry I mean generally any
game at altar is fine but if you're on a
mid-range card like a 270x or an i-9 280
or gtx 760 you may want to play around
with this setting and get the best frame
rates and get get the smoothest
experience out of your graphics card
because I mean generally a lot of people
from time to time they'll be like
they'll get their gravis card whether it
be a GTX 760 or whatnot and they'll
install it max the graphics on the game
and then they'll be like oh this game
sucks because the gameplay is choppy and
generally it's not the games fold it's
just I guess what you do with the frame
rates so yeah mainly you want to get the
highest frame rate possible that your
monitor outputs usually most monitors
output 60 Hertz so you want to generally
be getting around 60 frames per second
for the best gaming experience in my
opinion so let's move on so that's the
first setting that you guys want to play
around with this MSAA the second setting
that you guys may want to look at is
ambient occlusion this one I find is a
big killer of frame rates I noticed even
in a game like black ops 2 this setting
would kill my frame rates by about ten
or fifteen percent in crisis it's called
lens flare I believe this setting yeah
generally it just takes away a heap from
your frame rates and it I mean it does
make the game it does give it that
realistic feel but it doesn't make the
game look better in my opinion so
ambient occlusion is one of those
settings that if I can't afford the
frame rates I generally switch off first
I do that before MSAA so maybe you might
want to switch this off first if you
like your MSA or your SMA so anyway
that's the setting that's a big one you
should turn it off if you can or turn it
on low settings I mean if you've got
again if you've got that 780ti 780ti and
you just don't care that's not going to
worry you but if you're on that
mid-range graphics card look out for
this setting and the third setting I
wanted to talk to you guys about is
obviously the textures and the quality
of the models and 3d modeling and stuff
like that and generally you want this as
high as possible you want this on ultra
if you can if not high or even medium
depending on your graphics card so this
is the last setting that you should
sacrifice
ice in my opinion but if you need to get
those higher frame rates then definitely
drop this setting down and drop it down
to medium or high in my experience
especially with the game like
Battlefield 4 for instance I don't
notice a big difference between ultra
and high it was it was weird though the
frame rate it gave me an extra 10 15 or
percent when I switched it from ultra
too high so that's something you may
wish to play around with depending on
your depending on your graphics card so
there as it goes like this in order in
priority switch off ambient occlusion if
you need extra frames and then play with
MSA and then play with your textures
that's just my recommendations to
getting the best gameplay out of your
graphics card now I am talking to you
guys on the so I just want to talk about
a few different things besides gravis
now because a lot of you guys probably
want a quick update I am recording off
the zoom h1 now it is connected to a
computer so it is acting as a condenser
microphone so let me know how that
sounds in the comments I also wanted to
talk quickly about leper power supplies
and damn i have had two leper power
supplies fail on me now this is this is
like consecutively so Wow stay away from
this brand they called leper I just did
a power supply review for that power
supply the first one was dead on arrival
and the second one it was working
however it's starting to cut off it's
starting to break my computer started
randomly cutting out I checked all the
connections everything was fine
everything was good to go I reconnected
everything receded the RAM whatnot you
name it I did it and then the computer
was still cutting out and it wasn't
until then I like okay I'm going to put
my trusty and antec earthwatts 650 watt
bronze in there and see how we go and
I've put that in there and I've been
running it for a few days and ya lo and
behold my computer has not been
switching off so this is me getting two
power supplies now one after the other
the same power supply leper G 800m gold
rated power supply and its failed on me
twice and the 650 watt power supply
hasn't missed a beat for years so leper
you guys are making
trash power supplies lay I don't know
what you're doing I mean if they're from
enermax or if they're from channel well
whatever but you guys aren't quality
testing your products clearly because
I've got to pounce players that are dead
now to file a little faulty and that's
consecutively one after the other and
that's sealed from the factory I've
never had that in my entire life I've
never had a part come and then it's
faulty and then I've got a replacement
and that's faulty again so I mean wow
what what what is going on leper what
are you guys doing in the factory that's
making these power supplies not work so
my advice is to stay away from this
brand if you're thinking about buying a
power play make sure you cross leper off
your to look less so don't just cross
that brand off completely just don't put
that in your power supply you'll be I
mean in your power supply cart or
whatever seriously stick to see sonic
antec of course I mean corsair use
seasonic anyway I think so yeah you want
to stick to the trusted brands that have
been around for years that's what I've
realized and I ain't going anywhere but
see sonic or antec personally so that's
just my advice for you guys yeah leper
stay away from this brand my god what
two for two holy crap I've never had
this in my life so I'm just I had to
tell you guys about it seriously it was
terrible I'd last thing I want to talk
about two is actually hooking this
microphone up as well there's I looked
for a three three eighths of an inch
bolt to a quarter of an inch thread just
so I could hook this up to my mic stand
because the h2 zoom h1 it only has a
tripod mount stand in it and so I was
looking around and I could only find one
guy selling this a tad adapter bolt for
like twelve dollars posted twelve
dollars for a bolt are you kidding me
like twelve dollars this guy wanted
twelve dollars just for a little bolt so
anyway I went down to my local hardware
store and I got I got a three three
eighths of an inch bolt and then I got a
quarter of an inch thread super glued it
and then sold it together and it costed
me twelve cents I'll repeat that twelve
cents
so I just I mean I had to get this off
my chest because it's like anyone else
who wants to make one of these bolts
just do it yourself and you'll you know
literally you'll save ten dollars so i
just thought it was a ripoff i mean if
the bolt was like three dollars i could
understand maybe even five dollars
posted i can understand but twelve
dollars like come on Jesus there's only
a limit to how much you know I can get
fleeced so that's about it for me guys I
will be coming back to you guys with
tech talk very soon I just wanted to
sort of test this microphone out make
sure it sounded good also talk about
that topic of graphics cards which a lot
of people have been asking me lately and
I enjoyed this commentary if you did
please give it a thumbs up and if you
have any questions please leave a
comment the comment section below and
I'll go out to you as soon as I can and
in the meantime in the description below
put some up with these recommendations
that I've talked about in the commentary
as well so you don't miss out on it and
yeah I'm just playing a bit of dr.
report on heroes of newerth and it is a
fun game I've actually got to compare
this game to dota 2 honestly I like both
games I just prefer here as in u.s. due
to some things that I'd liked it I mean
I'd like to have a discussion about it
because ultimately I mean dota 2 has a
huge player base and I think they get a
lot of things right that here is in u.s.
doesn't but um yeah something I want to
talk about anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this commentary and yet peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
