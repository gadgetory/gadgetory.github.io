wickedest and wildest Kravis cops out
there in the mid-range section this is
the sapphire nitro OC Edition rx 581
head of putting that head-to-head
against the GTX 1060 90 with the second
edition gaming X from MSI so let's find
out who is going to come out on top
welcome back in tech city this is the
yes man Bryan coming to you guys today
with the sapphire Nitro+ this is the rx
580 which out of the box comes with a
fourteen hundred and eleven megahertz
core clock and also eight thousand
effective memory clock now I did manage
to overclock this to nine thousand on
the memory and also on the core clock I
managed to get to around about fourteen
hundred and sixty five megahertz now
ironically enough this is also where my
rx 570 horas got on the core clock so
maybe it seems like the RX 570 and five
80s on air are maxing out at around
fourteen hundred and sixty megahertz
though on the other side of the fence we
have here the GTX 1060 from MSI to the
gaming X and now the boxis has around
nineteen hundred and 80 megahertz or at
least that's where it boosts to I
managed to get this to around about two
thousand and sixty megahertz on the core
and also on the memory I managed to get
quite a sizable boost as you can see in
my overclocking tutorial when I use this
exact graphics card though with that
said let's get on with the benchmarks
and compare these two bad boys
head-to-head to see who comes out on top
you
you
Oh
so the benchmarks really tell us what we
need to know and that is that the RX 580
and the GTX 1060 a really neck-and-neck
in a lot of those titles the gtx 1060
did edged out the RX 580 at least in my
testing it also did overclock better
whilst remaining cooler and using quite
a substantial amount less power from the
wall i found when they'll burst
overclocked the gtx 1060 was juicing
about 80 watts less then the nitro
overclocked and now the Nitro see from
sapphire is a pretty popular model a lot
of people tell me that sapphire make the
best graphics cards on the AMD lineup of
cards so we saw that the msi did come
out on top in my opinion it did edge it
out by a little bit but also the
Augmented benefits are there as well you
get the power consumption benefits you
also have the card running a good 10
degrees cooler when both the fan speeds
were on 80% so on that note of fan
settings I'll let you guys take a listen
to both these cards on 60 and 80%
so what we saw is both these graphics
cards whether they'll both kick us they
both have passive fans that in Idol on
the desktop won't spin up at all and
they also remain pretty quiet on this
stock overclock settings even though
they do get hotter temperatures at least
when I was doing my benchmarks in
UniGene Heaven Valley though you may be
wondering what about dx12 and the future
of both these graphics cards so if you
wanted to have both of them in the next
two years wouldn't be rx 580 perform
better in the long run
well the RX 580 is kind of like a
refresh and it does have more aggressive
clock speeds and it does use more power
over the RX 480 and with that I found
that it's still coming neck-and-neck
with the 10 60 so you've got those
benefits now with you getting a 10 60
however it is reported that AMD does
perform better on dx12 and also Vulcan
titles however I am finding in DX 12
titles that the 1060 is doing a really
good job I think all these reports that
we heard where the AMD cards were just
going to absolutely sweep the floor and
the Nvidia cards in DX 12 and Vulcan has
been kind of overstated in ways with the
1060 here actually performing really
well so what about fine wine technology
well at least in some of the older cards
that I've tested by the 7970 they have
gained substantial benefits over time
due to them still being inherently on GC
n much like the RX 470 and 480 and even
580 of still GC n based cards however
this time around things may be a little
bit different within these next
generation Vega cards reported to use a
new architecture so maybe the gcn fine
wine technology may be coming to an end
also both these graphics cards can
capture desktop and gameplay footage
with AMD having their relive and NVIDIA
having the GeForce experience and also
with the rx 580 you do get an extra 2
gigabytes of vram onboard so that is
maybe a selling point if you tend to use
this for higher resolutions going into
the future and you like to micromanage
your settings though taking a closer
look at the gaming X this is a dual slot
cooler with two fans and it also has an
msi RGB LED on the side and the accents
light up on the back of the card and you
also get a pretty sleek backplate
there's only one 8 pin PCIe connector
and also the inputs and outputs include
three display ports one HDMI 2.0 and a
DVI
cow when we contrast that to the
sapphire nitro this is a graphics card
that needs an eight pin and a 6 pin
connector and also has on the rear of
the card to display out and also to HDMI
out and one DVI and also on the side of
the Sapphire card you get an RGB LED
that lights up and the back plate is a
very interesting design overall I must
say that I really dig the look of this
card it is very sleek and it is very
simple and it does stand out though as
for pricing both these graphics cards
currently come in at 260 u.s. so if you
are in Australia be gaming X 1060 is
currently 35 Australian dollars cheaper
than the Nitro OC so it depends on what
country you're in but the pricing does
usually differ so if you are in
Australia I'd definitely say pick up the
1060 over the 580 and if you are in
America I'd say you might want to flip a
coin and see the benefits and negatives
of both so when it all comes down to it
I would personally pick the 1060 over
the 580 I think that low-power
consumption means less heat getting
dumped in your case this card also
overclocked better and it remained
quieter and cooler whilst doing so
however my friend Steve over at hardware
and box he has a different take on
things I'll put the link to his video in
the description below where he actually
recommends the 580 over the 1060 though
in this case I may believe the Ferrari
of benchmarking may have got a flat tire
when he was benchmarking this time
anyway guys if you enjoyed this video to
be sure to hit that like button and let
me know in the comment section below
which one would you pick and why can't
wait to read your comments as always
even the bad ones and the funny ones and
the trolling ones and the crazy ones and
I'll catch you guys in another tech
videos very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
