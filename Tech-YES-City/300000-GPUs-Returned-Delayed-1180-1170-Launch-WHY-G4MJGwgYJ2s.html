of the you and today we're gonna be
talking about some graphics cards the
eleventh series apparently delayed again
apparently as an OEM that has delivered
300,000 GPUs back to in video so we can
talk about that we can talk about
pricing why this is happening what's
gonna happen in the next few months and
of course some other news as well let's
roll that intro hope you enjoyed that
intro welcome back to tech yes city guys
we have teknon D news desk right here
some fresh rumors out of the mill is
apparently that we're gonna move on to
the new segment here we've got it
reports out of Taiwan suggests from C
calfile Seeking Alpha comm that 300,000
GPUs have been returned to in video
because they just simply can't sell them
and now the biggest reason for this is
that big cryptocurrency boom and there's
a lot of factors involved here but
mainly I'd say cryptocurrency is the
reason for this but there's other few
factors as well we've talked about and
this is going back to this article here
Nvidia naturally expected through 2018
that the demand for crypto currencies
would just keep on coming it just
wouldn't stop and so when that happened
what we saw was really now they're in a
glut where they're trying to sell their
new grams cards but mining is not
profitable anymore so we look at the
prices of zen cash for instance z cash
as well two very popular crypto
currencies that were mined on nvidia
graphics cards they've taken a big dive
and they still are diving to this day
and so what this means for the average
dude out there who was mining on these
Nvidia grams cards is his pretty much
like look I want to sell my graphics
cards I don't need 10 gravis guys that
aren't making me any money some videos
trying to sell new graphics cards the
guys are trying to the mind is some of
the mine is they're trying to sell their
whole graph Scouts and of course what
someone gonna do they're gonna want to
buy a graph scout $200 $300 they're
gonna go buy the use graph scout save
some money especially when it's the same
performance same efficiency same
everything
so videos really sort of created this
market for themselves that's gonna be
difficult for them to get out of unless
of course they release the new 11 series
grams cards and so it does have to come
while you can read all this news like oh
my god scaremongering
300,000 grabs cards got returned I can't
get a gravis girl I mean I have to get a
10 Series card now because Len series
cards aren't coming I kind of disagree
with this like I said earlier in the
year they have to come soon NVIDIA has
to make money they're a publicly listed
company and so with that if they don't
release a new graphics card architecture
what's gonna happen is they're going to
be competing with themselves people want
Aaron series cards as well will want to
upgrade whether it be they want more
performance of 4k they want higher
upgrades well they just got that new
upgrade as itch that needs to be
scratched so really when it comes down
to it
Nvidia did mess up big-time in the sort
of the cryptocurrency demand forecasts
and so now I guess they're bearing the
brunt of that according to this article
here from Hindustan Times calm so yeah
300,000 graphs guys reportedly returned
we don't know who it is - 1 out of 3 of
the top 3 Taiwanese OEMs apparently
reported this so it's pretty much
groundbreaking news and also what's up
chat we are live streaming this news I
am live here for you guys because I
haven't made a video in a couple of days
either so I've been very busy behind the
scenes sort of getting back into the
groove again my eighties rock on as well
so hope you guys are enjoying this sort
of livestream segment of the brand new
fresh news now of course cryptocurrency
there's a whole market there itself what
is going to happen with that but as I
said before I see a plateauing I said
this at the start of the year when we
saw that massive spike in January with
cryptocurrency prices I thought it was
going to drop off and then Plateau and
that's kind of what we're seeing now but
not only that was seeing the difficulty
is still up there and it's actually
rising in some cases especially for the
good crypto currencies versus the bad
ones I think the bad ones are gonna
continue to go down go out of business
but the good cryptocurrencies are gonna
remain there and so you're gonna see a
lot of the miners go over to them it's
gonna make them more difficult to mine
and of course more grabs cars will be
sold on the market
of course when the new 11 series cards
do eventually come with 2000 series what
are they going to call it gtx 1180 GTX
2080 - we'll make demand for them as
well so biggest thing that I'm sort of a
bit of perplexed about here though is
when we look at the pricing of these
graphics cards Nvidia wants to sell
these grabs caster people if they really
want to sell them they're like okay we
got 300 thousand grams Scouts also gonna
do is lower the prices down to where
they were like a year and a half ago I
mean I look on amazon.com grab Scott's
prices are still a ripoff when we look
at it I mean we still got gtx 1060 s not
under 200 bucks I remember paying about
a hundred and eighty for a GTX 1063
gigabyte that was us prices this is
light at the end of 2016 so what's going
on you want to sell these grams cards
just simply drop the prices it's not a
hard formula to figure out so I mean we
look at if we go here we go to gtx 750ti
same deal you'll see these are way
overpriced from where they were before
190 bucks 180 US so essentially they're
saying okay come buy a gtx 1050 TI for
the price that someone else paid a year
and a half ago for a gtx 1060 no one
wants that so you want some grounds
cards get dropped prices though will say
in a stray up recently
places like ms why they had 20% off all
they grabbed his cards so I believe we
will be able to get cheaper cards in
purchasing parity price than people in
the US would so that kind of delivers a
bit of a weird curveball because we pay
10% tax anyway in Australia here so not
too sure
maybe expect to see graphics card price
has come down a lot now with this news
of course when will the Tendo sorry one
belittle Evans here boob a bit
when will the 11 series of 2000 series
cards come I'm guessing that they will
be out by September there's just this
whole new storm about oh my god sales we
can't sell the gravis cards Computex I
said not for a very long time again guys
businesses business there is a definite
answer and when these cards will have to
get released and that's just business
and I'm predicting September that's as
long as they can stretch it out before
they have to say look we'll get any of
the cards out but after that what
happens to the old cards if they still
have them in stock
a lot of the times in history back in
the past when you've seen these prices
of Grammys cards and also CPUs as well
very popular strategy is to filter out
the new parts to places like the US
Australia UK and then in emerging
markets they'll filter out the old stuff
and drop the prices there so I know a
lot of guys in India for example in some
places of Europe they pay way too much
for these graphs cuts and so what they
do is they drop them they drop the
prices their people feel like they're
getting a deal because getting them for
the same prices now as they were in the
u.s. so they sell and filter out and
funnel out a lot of those parts to
emerging markets so that's not going to
change as well but some good news coming
out of this will I guess actually not
that good of the news is that in 2020
AMD's plans to release their 7 nanometre
plus the new architecture as well so new
architecture note rank everything in
2020 so they're gonna be coming to the
grand scale division with that and then
Intel on the flip side 2020 as well
seems to be the magic year for them so
they've recently required acquired sorry
livestream blunders here they've
recently acquired a Roger Kaduri
took him from AMD and now he's got a
massive R&amp;amp;D budget and they're getting
some talent there getting some top-tier
talent in to really make themselves a
top-tier architecture in 2020 what do
you guys think in the comments do you
think Intel is going to be a dominant
force in the graphics card scene that'll
be very interesting as we've heard in
the past they have had some endeavor
into the GPU field right now I'm
streaming on the Intel nook as well
which is a collaboration between Intel
and Andy's Radeon graphics phenomenal
little device I mean at Computex I use
this thing to edit and stream 4k videos
smashed out all that content content
during Computex so yeah anyway I'm gonna
join chat now guys hope you enjoyed this
little live stream news segment if you
didn't be sure to hit that like button
also let me know what you think when
will these new graphics cards be
released do you think mmm
prices will come down well let me know
lover in your thoughts and opinions as
always I'm just gonna hop in to chat and
chat with you guys catch you next time
peace out for now but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
