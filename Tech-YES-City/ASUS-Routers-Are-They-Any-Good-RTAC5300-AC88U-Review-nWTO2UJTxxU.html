the type N from d-link and that was a
main VDSL router and modem all-in-one
solution that we put in the second floor
where I'm currently living and although
it is a nice modem it doesn't have the
reach for the wireless so on each of the
floors I didn't want to install
different wireless solutions now you
guys out in the audience when I had the
tp-link dekho come through you guys said
that was absolute garbage so I decided
to play some lawn balls with it and they
did actually pretty well for that so
when Roose reached out to me and asked
me to take a look at their AC 5300 and
also the AC 88 you I said sure thing
because I was looking for a solution
downstairs that would provide Wireless
here in the studio that would also be
strong and also give me a lot of options
and also extra ports that I could use to
replace the current d-link switch that
I'm using where I only use up to eight
ports of that switch anyway so it does
have a lot of extra ports and it does
have P OE and there are some benefits to
that dealing switch that I have down
here however really when it comes down
to it I only need something like the 88
you with Wireless until I'm ready to
upgrade to 10 gig which is a massive
upgrade in itself anyway here on the
desk we have two routers one being the
RT AC 5300 which is an 8 antenna tribe
and a 4 port router and also their AC ad
au which is 8 ports however it's only a
dual band with four antennas now the
antennas don't make too much of a
difference in the wireless signal
strength but what these two modems do
offer over the Taipan is indeed a
greater reach so the marketing on the
box says it does have great coverage and
when I tested it downstairs which has to
go through a lot of concrete from where
it's originally at the signal was indeed
strong girls getting two bars
consistently in all areas of the studio
as opposed to the Taipan which was
sometimes dropping out which I can't
have if I need to upload certain things
from my smartphone for instance and also
on the note of wireless the 5300
megabits per second is the max
theoretical speed if you combined the
three bands together the two five
gigahertz bands and also the two point
forty yards band and you have a device
that has three wireless connections that
can bridge together not many devices can
do
this hence why I'm actually picking for
me personally the ad au which has a 5
gigahertz band and also a 2.4 gigahertz
band now the pricing of these units is a
little bit expensive in Australia 399
for the ad au 485 AUD for the 5300 if
you're in the u.s. it is a lot better
price 240 US dollars for the 88 you and
also 300 USD flat for the 5300 so I
would like to see a Zeus fix the pricing
for Aussies and also another note for
Aussies is that this doesn't have a VDSL
modem built in unlike the type end that
didn't have the modem built in so if the
Zeus did want to have a big winner on
their hands in Australia I'd recommend
them getting the VDSL switch put in
place too but with those negatives out
the way let's find out what makes these
routers in my opinion some of the best
out there
welcome back to tech yes it is brian
coming to you guys today with a review
of these two routers now the first thing
i'm going to get out of the way with I'm
picking the 88 you over the 5300 and the
reason I'm doing this is twofold
actually the first thing is I like the
clean look of the 88 you it's got four
antennas it doesn't look too outlandish
in my opinion and the second reason is
it's got eight ports onboard now in the
studio down here I have my own network
installed in the behind the walls and so
I do need eight ports over four ports on
the 5300 now there is a version of the
5300 that does have 8 ports as well but
even for my purposes it's still a little
bit of overkill I only need the dual
band down here because it's one studio
and the wireless coverage in the studio
from the 88u is phenomenal I get really
fast link speeds of course the 5300 is
similar but you do get that extra band
so if you don't need the extra ports
from the 88 you and you want that extra
Wireless range in coverage it is a
little bit stronger then this may be for
you of course the aesthetic as I said
before it is hit or miss for me I did
prefer the 88 you but now back onto what
makes these routers actually quite
special and that's when you go into the
user interface now you can log in
through the details which are printed on
the modem itself you can then easily set
up your own username and password and
there's also many different things you
can do on here but also the fact that
it's so simple and easy to learn you've
got all the options you need the first
thing I'm going to say is the QoS or the
packet scheduling software included is
phenomenal you can throttle people
individual computers that are attached
to this router in other words you can
limit the bandwidth so if you've got
someone in your family who's downloading
all the time and you just want to watch
Netflix you can say pick their computer
up and say hey we've got 100 megabits
per second download how about I give you
50 and leave 50 free for everyone else
on the network you can also do this for
upload speeds if you're streaming this
was a graph that I actually had with the
Taipan from d-link the QoS was very
simplistic it only prioritized certain
kinds of packets these lease routers
here they can also do that they can
practice streaming packets or if you're
a gamer they can prioritize the gaming
packets and hence why the gaming is
printed on the box
they've also
what the fast printed on the box as well
now for certain games there's a lot of
different service throughout the world
so if you have a username and password
then you can have what the fast manage
from both these routers if you wish to I
think that was a good thing for World of
Warcraft though I haven't played World
of Warcraft for quite some time now
they're moving on with this router
they've also got what they call a eye
protection which will filter out
malicious packets I don't really want to
test this as I usually don't do anything
dodgy anyway on my computer though if
you're one of those persons or you have
someone in your family that's prone to
clicking on exe files and emails then
you may wish to turn this on there's
also the guest network services as well
so if you want to use this at a hotel
you can give people a different network
and make it more simplistic if you wish
to you can also filter out certain
websites and also if you're a parent you
can filter out what your kids watch so
there is parental mode which will work
quite well if you want to stop your kids
from watching porn for example but I
don't know if that's a good thing you
don't know what else they would get up
to then anyway getting back to the
review it's got 128-bit encryption
you've also go to USB 3 and 2 ports
which can share your printer over the
network or if you want to attach an
external hard drive you can share that
external hard drive over the network to
essentially making it a very easy nice
solution if you wish to and some
last-minute touches with this device is
also the ability to login to the a
iCloud 2.0 and on the back of the box
they've got what they call zombie
protections so
and I will say before I get on out of
here as well in this modem itself
there's just a huge amount of features
and options that are way too complex for
me to it is literally one of the best
you eyes that I've seen on a router to
date so Zeus definitely not their doing
I thought with them being a mother board
company that makes monitors they
wouldn't be that well versed in routers
but sure enough they're making an
exceptional product here that does
deliver on a lot of the promises that
they say on the box except for the
zombie thing I'm maybe who knows if
there's some zombies around at the Gold
Coast let me know and we can test out
this zombie protection service here
anyway guys hope you enjoyed today's
review of the ACA d8u and also the AC
5300 as I said before even though this
one's more expensive I'm not picking it
over the AC 88u as that does everything
I needed to I like the look better and
it's got those eight ports which I
desperately need down in the studio here
though I would like to see something
like this come out with a few 10 gig
ports on board I think that would be
perfect for someone like me at least in
a studio where I do have or I do plan to
get a lot of 10 gig switches installed
just to make a lightning-fast Network
and I'm sure as usar definitely capable
of it another thing as well if you're in
Australia it doesn't have the VDSL modem
support built-in so you will have to
connect the modem to this router and
then you can use the features from this
router however once you do that it will
give you a really good experience anyway
guys hope you enjoyed today's review if
you did them sure to hit that like
button let me know in the comment
section below if there's anything else
you wish to know about these routers and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon
peace out for now bye
which will work quite well if you want
to stop your kids from watching porn for
example don't stop I'm watching porn
it's probably better than they do that
it will give you a little bit better
wireless coverage throughout your higher
hop and then a Zeus rip it is an eighth
band naughty bad and also on the note of
the wireless and the fancy numbers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
