the 6600 K this is in chels latest gen
CPU and also going to compare it to the
5820k and the four six seven UK ladies
and gentlemen welcome to check out city
this is brand coming to you guys today
with a review of the 6600 k now we're
going to get straight on into the
benchmarks and then we're going to talk
about this CPU and how compared to the
other next best competitors
so as you can see from the benchmarks
there skylake only performed about five
to seven and a half percent better than
the four six seventy K and the best-case
scenario was the Cinebench score there
the r15 benchmark which showed seven
hundred and fifty points versus six
hundred and ninety-seven points now
you're probably wondering why am I only
getting a seven and a half percent
increase at best compared other tech
sites that is showing even up to twelve
percent increases
well that's because with Haswell you
have to set the case ratio below the
core clock if you set it at the same
speed as the core clock or above you get
a detriment or a hit to performance and
I've tested this in the past and
sometimes it can make a six percent
difference that's right without even
changing the core clock at all so when
we're comparing an apples to apples for
670 K at 4.6 gigahertz versus a 6600 K
at 4.6 gigahertz we end up with speeds
that aren't that impressive to be honest
especially for a CPU that's been
released two years later now what about
power consumption and heat well I will
say that skylake seems to run a bit
cooler even though I do have a new
cooler on here so I'm not going to
really be comparing temperatures and
also one thing I will say about skylake
is that they've got it right at least
with the thermal paste on the die this
time I had to actually deal in my four
670 K to get it up to a stable 4.6
gigahertz this on the other end does not
need that the one thing I will point out
as though this chip on average needs
more voltage than it has well we'll need
to get to the same core speeds which was
interesting I got this to 4.6 gigahertz
at one point two eight volt this on the
other hand needed one point three five
volt which is interesting since we're
stepping down to 14 nanometer so things
are kind of a little bit interesting
with this chip though I will say one
thing and that is that the power
sumption was roughly the same though
when I did the prime95 benchmark there
with the maximum heat or power output
this scored around about 264 watts and
this scored around about 260 watts so
power consumption really doesn't differ
that much between these two CPUs and on
idle the 6600 K rig I had was using a
little bit more though keep in mind that
I am running a lot more fans this time
and I am running an all-in-one water
cooler which will use up a bit more
power on idle than when I had this rig
which only had a single cooler and a
single fan installed so at the end of
the day can I recommend the 6600 K and
then the answer to this is yes and no
the yes being for those people who need
the single core performance we're
talking diehard ARMA 3 fans or people
who just love the fastest boot speeds
possible and then there comes the no
recommendation this is a little bit
tricky because I'm going off the top of
my head here but when this was first
released I remember paying around about
220 USD adjusted for this as opposed to
the 6600 K which cost me around about
260 USD adjusted so we can see there
we've got a $40.00 increase and we only
have a 7.5 percent increase after two
years so keep in mind though this is a
note rink and an architectural
improvement so I'm really not that
impressed with the 6600 K especially
when you look at what other options out
there we have the 1231 v3 which is the
Xeon house well it's got 8 threads it
costs less than 6,600 K and you don't
have to go out and buy a CPU cooler you
don't have to go out and buy an
overclockable motherboard and you're
going to be using less power so for
people on single graphics cards that
makes more sense at the moment and then
you have the 5820k for the people who
want to step it up to productivity this
thing just absolutely poops all over the
6600 K and the 4 670 K when it comes to
productivity and it only costs $100 more
keep in mind though the motherboards are
a little bit more expensive but you're
going to get much more productivity out
of the 5820k as opposed to the 6600 k so
before we move on to the final score I
will say that I did not test the eye GPU
on this because it doesn't really
on this review considering broad wells
out there at the moment which has a much
better IG PU on board and also if you're
going for price performance you might
want to check out AMD's ap use as well
so this leads me the final score of
three and a half stars out of five I did
take a whole staff just because the
performance wasn't that impressive not
to mention I had to give it more volts
then my house well CPU to get to 4.6
gigahertz and the power consumption
really didn't differ at all between
these two CPUs and this is two years in
the making so I'm really not impressed
in that aspect I also took off another
half a staff of the value for money
since this CPU in relative terms is more
expensive when the four 670 K was first
released so weighing up those two things
it leads me to the three and a half
stars out of five now the person who
would benefit from this as I said
earlier is the person looking for the
best IPC on the market as well as the
motherboards as well they've got all the
latest USB 3.1 on there good onboard
audio good anti-seize and whatnot and
you will have fun overclocking this and
for me when I first got on it I did have
a bit of fun but now after I'm actually
critically analyzing this CPU for what
it is it brings me to this score so one
of the guys I hope you enjoyed this
review of the 6600 K if you have any
questions or comments about this skylake
6600 cake then leave a comment in the
comment section below
also the i7 6700 CAD involve picking
that up as well as around about a
hundred and fifty dollars more than the
ice barbarian and for that price you
could go pick yourself up at 5820k which
again will knock it out of the water
the productivity hey guys if you liked
this video please give it a fat like and
I will catch you in another tech video
very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
