good old gam tree and there is a pretty
good deal on a whole system this is an
i7 3770 with a 280 X and it's got a
pretty decent power supply as well see
sinking about to ram decent board decent
case so if this checks out it's gonna be
a really good deal now though asking 350
Aussie dollars and then I came in 50
under and they accept it so in US dollar
terms that would be a little bit over
200 so if this checks out it's gonna be
a really good deal for the money in my
opinion but there's also something else
I'm really curious about and that is how
an i7 3770 would perform with something
like in RTX 2060 and we're gonna be
comparing that the difference in FPS
first say at 99 hundred K to see how
much value you're actually getting out
of getting a deal on something like this
but with that aside let's go pick this
thing up first see what we're getting on
the deal and then chuck in the RT X 2060
when we get back
today's video is brought to you by the Z
390 as rock fantasy gaming X with a
massive heatsink covering three MVP
slots at the bottom a flexible
integrated IO shield and also Wi-Fi six
this board has it all if you're looking
for a top tier Z 390 motherboard links
in description below to find out more
so it's now the next day and I took last
night off just to relax a little bit but
this is just way more than I bargained
for Wow we've got a gigabyte g1 sniper
in here as well as a 3770k so they
actually miss listed the CPU and then
we've got the 280x there which we're
gonna pull out very soon and put it in
our TX 2060 but a decent power supply
650 watt it's got 1.5 terabytes of hard
drive so singular 500 gigabyte singular
one terabyte and we got 8 gigabytes of
RAM so this is just I'm blown away by
this because the case is actually not
too bad as well you got two blue LED
fans at the front for bling this one
here being RGB you can control it to
whatever color you want and then I asked
him have you got any other parts that
just don't work or have problems and
they had this which they chucked in for
free x58 i don't even know the cpu yet
but it's got one of these older coolers
on it so that'll be interesting to see
but they just reckon it turns on and
then it turns off so my suspicion being
the Northbridge heatsink needs to get
the thermal paste changed if that's
possible when we have a completely free
working x58 board i'm gonna be a static
and then there's this as well a HP board
they said they put in a graphics card
and there's absolutely no signal coming
out of it but when I saw it's a HP board
it's pretty obvious to know why the
secure boot and stuff like that so I'll
take a look at that and see what we can
do with that but the main one here is
just such good value for money this is
what it's all about with hustling and
the funny thing was when I went over
there I was about 4:15 p.m. when I
picked it up they said someone else was
ready to come at 6:00 p.m. so I was
lucky I got in there early otherwise the
person who was selling it would have
just sold it to someone else so that was
really awesome to see but let's give
this thing some proper tech yes loving
and then boot it up and let the
benchmarks begin
so we just finished benchmarking the
3770k on the g1 sniper with a few
different scenarios here in the first
scenario we had it at stock speeds which
on these speeds at turbo to up to 3.9
gigahertz on all those four cores in a
threads and that was coupled with 1600
megahertz CL 11 that's the default
timings for this memory now with some
different configurations of memory
you usually get either 1333 megahertz CL
9 or 1600 mega at CL 11 it usually tends
to default to those two so going into
your BIOS and especially if you've got
XMP profiles on and enabling them will
give you quite a big boost as we're
seeing in some of these titles here
we'll pull up the worst case scenario
first which I noticed was far cry new
dawn where we saw an average FPS of 60
and then a minimum of 37 but when we
overclocked just the memory alone and we
had some g.skill stuff here 2133 CL 11
we then went up to 77 average fps and 51
minimum now we do have the 9900 K in the
fray here and of course that's going to
do the best with the Archie X 2060
there's no denying that we've also got
an aggressively out-of-the-box
clocked RT X 2060 Strix OC
so the 9900 K at 5 gigahertz with 3200
mega Hertz CL 14 memory is definitely
going to bring out those differences if
they exist so the worst case scenario we
had was 60 versus 119 so we're basically
getting double the FPS if we do
overclocking on the latest and greatest
and we don't do any overclocking on the
old-school stuff but keep in mind I did
throw the third result in there that's
the 3770k at 4.4 gigahertz quick and
easy OC
especially on this cooler since it's an
entry-level cooler and then we had the
memory at 233 as well and we saw 83 fps
and 55 minimum so we could see the
overclocking helped us out and gained
over 33% FPS alone just in farcry new
dawn now going over to the next game
apex lugnuts and we had here 93 average
FPS when we had the memory overclocked
90 and then also 94 with the CPU
overclocked as well so that's versus a
hundred and five on the 99 hundred K so
it wasn't a whole lot of a difference
here
about a 10% gain on the 99 hundred K and
then about 5% gain when we overclocked
versus the stock configuration so apex
Legends is definitely showing what it
can do if a game is very well optimized
on the CPU side even with a powerful
graphics card and the 1% in point one
percent loads especially the 0.1% lows
we're showing that there's virtually no
difference between these four different
configurations and the 1% loads were
lagging a little bit behind that of the
9900 K but that's because it got a
higher boost on the average fps in
general but move over to the next title
here shadows of the Tomb Raider we had a
worse score of 48 and 26 and basically
again with that 900k getting almost
double the FPS when that's the latest
and greatest overclocked but we still
didn't see a massive boost on the 3770k
overclocked with the memory nearly 50%
so that was great to see and it shows
the potential of the overclocking in
this games actually quite CPU demanding
on the memory side at least if we look
at the overclock the extra 500 megahertz
made a 8 FPS difference but overclocking
the memory alone made an 11 FPS
difference and that picked up the
minimums as well and then pulling up Tom
Clancy's the division 2 for the last
title we had here 117 FPS on the 9900 k
with 83 1% low and 50 5.1% low the
overclocking didn't really help on the
side of the 3770k both on the memory and
the CPU speeds but the memory if
anything did make more of a difference
than the CPU speed overclocked so that
was pretty good to see and it does sort
of paint this picture now when we move
over to a conclusion of these results
but we're still going to do a little bit
more with his video so don't worry we
can see
that memory speeds especially on ddr3
you definitely want to extract the most
out of them if you can I know for
instance when I've manually overclocked
even some pretty bad 1333 mega that's
memory I can generally get that stuff up
to 1866 in dual channel so if you've got
two eight gigabyte sticks and you go
into your bios and you check the speeds
are like pretty low most i have a little
crack with the main speed and the sub
timings and then maybe up the voltage to
around 1.6 volt and you should be good
to go you should be getting some
benefits in terms of average FPS and
also 1% in point one percent lows as we
saw with some of these titles but it
does of course depend on the title being
played and how that relates to whether
the memory speeds or the CPU speeds are
going to make more of a difference but
of course the last graph I've got to
pull out for you guys is the power
consumption between these two rigs which
did mean some power savings compared to
that of the 9900 K when that was
overclocked so over clock versus
overclocked we're saving roughly 45
watts but I did test this with the same
power supply and that was very important
because if I tested it with the corsair
power supply it's much more efficient
than the one that we had the thermal
takes smart flow in the rig that i
picked up so i tested it with the eighty
bronze on both scenarios so we could get
an apples-to-apples comparison and it's
about a 40 watt difference in unit gene
heaven so that's sort of like a
realistic power consumption benchmark on
average between CPU and GPU utilization
so that was pretty good to see that
3770k is still going pretty hard but the
main question still needs to be answered
and that is should you couple in RTX
2060 with the 3770k in 2019 and the
answer would be I mean if you can pick
it up cheap enough then why not I mean
the results here today didn't show any
stuttering so mainly going back to the
17.1% lows especially when we
overclocked the memory it was really
smooth in these four titles that we
played here today not to mention if we
decided to step things up to 1440p we
would see the difference between this
and the 9900 k diminish even that much
more it's pretty much double that of the
whole price I paid for this setup and
that's still included a 280 X so adding
in 290 X 20 C
see if you can get the whole build set
up right is not a bad choice I mean
personally I can see myself doing this
the worst case scenario being shadows of
the Tomb Raider the best case scenario
being Apex legends where we didn't see a
whole lot of a difference so these were
high settings as well I didn't test
Ultra settings I'm pretty sure if I
tested Ultra settings the differences
would have diminished a little bit more
between the two since it would have been
putting more strain on the GPU the
regardless of all that let us know in
the comment section below what you think
of the 3770k though after some recent
conversations before we move on to the
x58 stuff I will point out some of the
negatives with this older gear and that
is simply in this case I believe the age
would be the most important factor to
pay attention to how much longer is this
Hardware going to last and in this case
I check the g1 sniper's caps on the
motherboards and this thing really
hasn't been used a whole lot if you guys
want to go out and buy old used gear
like this make sure it boots up make
sure there's no problems and also just
check the caps on the motherboard that's
a quick and easy way to see how much
life you're going to have left in your
system but on that note this motherboard
does have USB 3 out it's got USB 3 on
the rear it's got jewel Nicks it's
actually a pretty loaded board the only
thing that's really missing is the m-dot
- native nvme on board but you can still
get a PCIe adapter but you would again
still have to update the BIOS that's
probably the biggest negative coming out
of this there's also no 5 volt or 12
volt RGB headers on the board but
generally with the newer boards that
only comes on the more expensive options
and considering the price we paid for
this today it was definitely an awesome
local deal let us know on the comment
section below what you guys think of
this deal but with that aside let's
check out this x58 board and see if we
can get at the boot and not switch off
after a couple of minutes because at
least with x58 in the bias it'll
actually tell you your Northbridge chips
temperature and if you just see that
continually rising well you'll know
whether that's the problem but before we
even switch it on I'm just gonna
actually clean that Northbridge heatsink
just to make sure save some time because
I think that's most likely where the
problem lies but let's find out
and that right there in the background
is what Tech yes City is all about we
gave it a bit of hardcore tech yes
loving took all the heatsinks off and at
that stage I replace the thermal paste
on the North Bridge but I decided to
also give the vrm as well as the rear of
the motherboard just a full brush down
because I noticed some gunk right around
those MOSFETs and you don't want any
stuff sort of sitting around there
because it can cause problems and then
after that I put everything back
together and actually decided to put in
a low powered Zeon just so nothing gets
stressed and I can diagnose one thing at
a time and that's exactly what's going
on in the background now it's been
running for over 10 minutes Northbridge
heat sink temperature the motherboard
temperature is staying under 30 degrees
which is really good but it is a 22
degree ambient environment but what this
means is we've got a working x58
motherboard and the cpu I pulled out was
a 980 X and we've got that for free so
this was just an absolute score this
$300 PC with the bonuses now that HP
motherboard I'm not even going to bother
testing that out because I know exactly
what's wrong with it just got the secure
boot and then on CSM and you can coupled
them with a GTX 580 and you can
generally sell off a really budget sort
of like fortnight 720 1080 P low
settings gaming PC and actually don't do
too bad I mean on the marketing recoup
some costs of this $300 that I spent on
this PC right here the 3770k plus we've
got a 280 X as well in the kitty so let
us know guys in the comment section
below what you think of today's hustle
I'm just blown away I mean the
performance with the 3770k it's still
pretty decent with 2019 I'd say the
sweet spot in terms of coupling this
with the new graphics card would be more
along the lines of the 1660 1080p but
the RT X 2060 if you want to do that and
go with that route just make sure you do
overclock your memory and also your CPU
to get the best performance out of this
old gear but without aside guys just
another day another hustle but also one
thing I forgot to mention earlier with
the 3770k setup was when I first booted
it up with the RT X 2060 it didn't boot
properly and so I had to update the bass
from the f4 version to the
seven then after that everything ran
absolutely fine
so if you do get these old rigs make
sure you do update the BIOS on them to
run them with the latest hardware if
you're gonna do sort of like a hybrid
like I did here today but other than
that everything's running well I'm super
happy because now I've got one of my
favorite boards and that's the x58
deluxe this is actually literally one of
my favorite boards of the x58 lineup it
had a really good VRM the price point
was pretty good had USB three had all
the BIOS features that you'd want to
overclock and the best thing to with
that zeal multipliers it managed to get
them overclocked on the top turbo clocks
to on all cause so that's why this one
in the background is one of my favorite
boards so you can expect it in a
showdown in the next couple of weeks
against the particular brand-new CPU
that's coming out as well as Intel's
latest and greatest because there should
be no secret by now that I love myself a
good deal and without a side guys if you
enjoyed this video then be sure to hit
that like button also let us know in the
comment section below what you think of
today's deal love reading your thoughts
and opinions as always and I'll catch
you guys in a nother tech video very
soon also if you want to see these
videos the moment they drop sub button
and you can ring the bell it's down
there and I'll catch you in the next one
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
