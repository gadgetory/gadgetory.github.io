recent codename two security bug called
meltdown Intel and Microsoft have joined
together to release a patch for Windows
10 and now today I'm going to be testing
that on the old-school Zeon's these are
the generation 1 sort of 6 core 12
threaded Xeon so you can pick up on
aliexpress for really cheap in your
coupling with x58 motherboards and
you're getting awesome price performance
these are some of my favorite chips even
till this date because of numerous
factors and I've tested this a lot in
the past but when I heard of this news
of this meltdown my heart sank because
apparently we're going to get a big drop
in performance from anywhere from five
to thirty percent and so when I read
about this news I was discern I was
concerned I was like damn does this mean
that all these old-school Zeon's and
good old chips even Sandy Bridge chips
are going to be affected by this update
this is the update that isolates the
page table and I've got more on that in
a link in the description below if you
want to read about the exact problem but
today we're gonna be doing the
benchmarks getting to the bottom of it
and also with that I will give you guys
some tips on how you can protect
yourself from this menace and for these
benchmarks were using a 1080 TI this is
the Duke Edition and for the CPU it is
the Xeon X 56 70 and we've overclocked
this to four point three two gigahertz
and it's got triple channel memory and
that is running at I believe fourteen
hundred and fifty megahertz now you
might think it's a little bit low but it
is in triple channel so effectively it
would be like 2,000 megahertz on dual
channel ddr3
welcome back to tech yes City and let's
get straight on to those numbers for you
guys moving on to csgo the first game we
had here using a community made map
would you guys recommend it to me and
this is a 1080p everything on low
settings and we're just running this
benchmark we got an average of 363 FPS
minimum of 139 a maximum of 675 now I'm
just gonna get these results out there
didn't really bother about 0.1% 1% lows
just wanted to see the before and after
and the after the patch we've got 359
FPS maximum of 666 and a minimum of 138
FPS so csgo showed practically no
difference at all before and after this
update and then we move on to dota 2 and
we've got the pre update 188 average FPS
172 minimum 205 maximum post update we
actually get a little bit better of
course within margin of error just like
csgo 190 average FPS 175 minimum and 205
maximum this was also on 1080p at the
lowest settings and now moving over to
GTA 5 again 1080p with the lowest
settings possible this is just to stress
the CPU to its max potential because
we're looking at the CPU since it is
meant to be affected by this update and
what we saw here was an average of 118
fps with a minimum of 107 129 before the
update then post update 120 on average
FPS with a minimum of 104 and a maximum
of 131 so GTA 5 actually ran slightly
better after the update of course we'll
talk about a little bit later I didn't
have a problem where I had to reset the
whole hard drive because that's one
thing we'll talk about with windows
itself it did have some problems
updating on this X 58 system though the
last game we've got up here is pub G of
course everyone wants to test pub G and
what we saw here at 1080p very low
settings was really good performance 123
average FPS 97 minimum 138 maximum pre
update post update 124 98 minimum 140
maximum now some of these benchmarks
will also have some variants as well
dota 2 and especially pub G since it's a
multi play game I do tests on ruins
however do run around that section just
to get an apples to apples comparison
but when it comes down to it the gaming
benchmarks there was no
difference with the pre and post updates
so basically this meltdown Security
floor and Intel CPUs and the update for
it is making no difference to gaming
whatsoever though what about rendering
videos now I did have Adobe Premiere Pro
installed I decided to do a quick render
test and before the update on a 4k video
we got 24 minutes and 22 seconds and
then post update we got 24 minutes and
18 seconds so then there wasn't much of
a difference at all so it didn't affect
rendering as well and then the last test
I decided round was Cinebench and pre
update we got a score of 950 points and
single of 127 post update 967 and single
of 128 so the update actually helped
performance but this is where things get
a little bit tricky because I actually
had to reinstall windows after I updated
the first time because I don't know what
happened I've never seen this before my
drive just corrupted and then it was no
longer be readable so even if I had a
backup image on that drive it couldn't
learn longer be read so it was just like
the drive got completely bricked by this
update and I got the error messages to
prove it actually captured those as well
so very odd problem and if you guys want
to update to this new update just make
sure you save your important files at
the very least because this is the first
time I've ever updated a computer and
it's bricked the whole machine like that
so not the parts I mean and physically
the hardware is ok
it's just I've had to reinstall windows
and that took a lot of time too so when
I reinstalled everything was ok so I
don't know what really happened there
also some other good news to come out of
this is Microsoft have rolled out the
updates immediately not just for the for
creators update but also the creators
update and the anniversary update too so
you go to the website and get that but I
believe you can just check your updates
and it should update automatically and
with that to Google Chrome on the 23rd
of January are rolling out a new update
on the Google Chrome browser which will
allow isolated tabbed browsing so that's
another feature that's being implemented
to combat this new threat so that's
about it for the meltdown problem
actually another two variants out there
Spectre and another one I've got to
research that a little bit more so if
what it's worth I'm sort of calmed down
now like I don't think this problem is
as bad as it is especially for single
and desktop users guys like you and me
who just use a computer play games or
edit videos and do work on I don't think
we're really affected like at all
actually from these benchmarks I've done
here today we're not affected really one
bit but where the problems lie of course
there are benchmarks showing that there
is performance differences and those
differences are for people with you know
large amounts of input and output reads
and writes especially for the server
market so that's where problems could
present themselves anyway guys if you
enjoyed today's video and be sure to hit
that like button and let me know in the
comment section below what you think
about this whole specter and meltdown
thing I also think on top of that single
users like you and me we're not really
going to be a target anyway because you
know we've got a couple hundred bucks in
the bank you know hackers with that much
talent and that much ability I'm not
gonna be going after guys like us when
if they do they're practically wasting
their talent in time so without side I
look forward to giving you guys another
tech video very soon and also I did do
one more benchmark but it's pretty much
invalid because I had to reformat the
whole system and that is a SSS D and
before we got a score of 234 and then
after we reformed out of everything
freed up some more space we got a score
of 319 so yeah and all that aside I
guess the main message to come out of
this video is if you haven't reinstalled
your OS in a while then maybe you should
it'll give you a little bit more
performance especially on your disk and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
