waiting for it and here it is today on
tech yes City this is the X 56 75 which
is over 8 years old now and is 6 cores
12 threads we managed to clock this up
to 4 point 5 gigahertz and use some
triple channel ddr3 memory which was at
1800 megahertz now comparing it against
the two brand new options we have the
risin 5 2,600 clocked at 4.1 gigahertz
on a be 350 motherboard and I decided to
use 32 hundred megahertz ddr4 memory and
then we have the last contender the i5
8400 very much a power efficient sort of
brand-new latest IPC best single core
performance but is it going to stack up
considering can only go up to 26 66 with
the ddr4 memory on a h3 70 motherboard
and of course for the graphics card we
are using the same GPU across all three
different rigs this is the Galax GTX 10
atti
so let's get this comparison underway
so first thing is first we're going to
take a look at the streaming benchmarks
we'll pull that up because a lot of
people will ask me to test some
streaming benchmark numbers we're using
xsplit 6 megabits per second now there's
two ways you can go about this and I
wasn't the only person in the studio
when I was testing these numbers so
people were witnessing what I was
talking about and I may make a dedicated
video towards this because streaming is
not that intensive if you set it up
right we're using xsplit we're using the
onboard GPU encoder which literally only
takes like a six to seven percent hit on
the GPU and the CPU feels practically
nothing so this is the option that I do
recommend as opposed to using the CPU
for encoding which in this particular
benchmark which is Final Fantasy 15 if
we were using the CPU encoding we saw
the CPU cores being stressed a lot more
than they otherwise would and there was
a massive stutter halfway through the
run there let's pull up some games at
1080p and 1440p first being Far Cry
primal we see at the X 50 675 did score
a loss in this benchmark it did fall
behind the risin 5 2600 which also fell
behind the 8400 and it was in eighth
sort of as expected
tandem they're moving up to 1440p
presented the exact same results moving
over across the csgo 1080p same sort of
scenario we saw the 8400 out in front
followed by the horizon 5 2600 followed
by the X 56 75 moving up to 1440p on
this same game with higher graphical
settings we saw it the exact same trend
continuing and then we move on to ashes
this is where things changed up a little
bit Rison 520 600 did score the victory
here coming over 200 FPS as opposed to
the 8400 which scored second place and
then the X 50 675 scored third place and
this was the same scenario in 1440p high
settings as well move over to Kingdom
Come deliverance and this is at 1080p
where the X 56 75 managed to score its
first victory over the risin v 2600 I
couldn't believe this and I did promise
in the livestream that I'd do some
jumping jacks if the X 50 675 did score
a victory either over one of these two
brand-new variants
success moving up to 1440p high settings
however we did see this trend did change
up a little bit and horizon 520 600 did
score a little bit better than the x50
675 so those jumping jacks were only
temporary
now the next game we got up here is dota
2 and at 1080p low settings a hundred
percent screen scale we saw pretty much
similar results across the board the
8400 was coming slightly ahead it's not
jumping jack worthy of course is there
is a very close run here and there is a
little bit of variance so I'm not gonna
do some jumping jacks for this one but
moving up to 1440p high settings saw the
same trend so dota 2 that wasn't a whole
lot of difference between it though
moving on to GTA 5 1080p normal settings
we did see a sizable or little sizable
difference between the X 56 75 and the
risin 5 2600 the 8400 came out ahead by
quite a bit but this is indeed jumping
jack worthy so quite an impressive feat
for an eight year old CPU its scoring a
minor victory over one of these
brand-new variants which is really
surprising but moving up now to 1440p we
see this trend discombobulate I think
that's the way we're going to use and
everything sort of returns to normal
with the GPU taking a lot more of this
drain moving over to the next game we
have pub G both 1080p and 1440p settings
really showed not much of a difference
here it was smooth across all three
different rigs there was nothing between
these if you want to play pub G on
either three of these machines you can
have a wonderful experience with a 1080
TI
also not to mention that this game does
have a 144 Hertz cap so I may actually
drop it from further testing in the
future and of course the last game was
showing here is Final Fantasy 15 we did
show it in the streaming benchmarks but
of course it's great to sort of get a
recap and say that there is no
difference this game does have a 120
Hertz cap however it does utilize all
cores and all threads if they are
available so it was impressive to see
the scaling on this game and it does
utilize those resources moving up to
1440p does show it's more GPU bound
even at high settings we can't even dare
go to ultra because that'll tank the FPS
even more so we're getting around 100
frames
at 1440p which is great if you've got an
ultra-wide monitor but we're testing it
1440p to 560 so we would lose even more
frames if we went to ultra right not
that that's important for this video
anyway moving over to productivity we
have a few different graphs here some of
the most important to paint a picture
Cinebench risin 5 2600 scoring number
one on both the single threaded and
multi-threaded performance 8400 coming
last and the multi-threaded performance
becoming second place in the single
threaded and the of course the x50 675
putting on a very impressive display
scoring over a thousand see be on that
multi-threaded test maybe two v-ray sort
of a similar trend in the CPU side of
things except the 8400 did beat the X 56
75 by a little bit Rison 520 600 did
like it was blazingly fast going well
ahead of the bell curve on this
particular benchmark but another
benchmark we're going through now is the
v-ray GPU side now I don't even know why
I run this to begin with I guess I just
drink my cup of coffee or cup of tea and
afk while the benchmark completes itself
but when I get back I've got the GPU
score there and surprisingly enough the
x50 675 shaved off one second it's got
one minute 6 seconds first the others
which got 1 minute 7 seconds so I was
really surprised to see that it shaved
off at 1 second now the difference is
been between these two platforms the big
ones being that this is a pcie 2.0 vs.
pci 3.0 and also we have ddr3 memory
versus ddr4 memory but whatever the deal
it makes the GPU run just that little
bit better in this particular benchmark
though continuing on with the benchmarks
we've got here at Dobie Premiere Pro 4k
render file final render times the rise
in 5 2,600 scores the victory by quite a
bit then it's followed by the 8400 which
is then followed by the X 56 75 so kind
of as expected though one thing to take
out of this is that you could edit
videos on any three of these pcs
absolutely fine though in the past one
I've tested music mix downs I have made
the tracks around about 4 to 5 minutes
which is more realistic but this time
for benchmark purposes we're gonna go
unrealistic 35 minute track we saw the
differences here there weren't that big
to begin with but the Rosen 520 600 did
come out in front and these were all
rendering close to 30 times real-time
render so if you need music production
then
three of these rigs will do a phenomenal
job at least in pros onus studio one
anyway
the last bench while we're pulling up
here 7-zip decompression and compression
I'll surprised to see the X 56 75 coming
out quite far ahead of the 8400 the 8400
did come last here and then the risin
five 2600 came out in front so if you're
into decompressing and compressing zip
files all day then the rather by 2600
will be the best option for you though
of course that last benchmark we're
going to pull up is one that's actually
been heavily requested and that's power
consumption so all these three rigs
overclocked and you will want to
overclock the X 56 75 because it does
have a lot of potential we can see it's
getting over 200 watts on load which is
a little bit scary I mean of course I'm
not gonna sit here and say that's an
amazing thing but it's 70 watts a
roughly 70 watts in front of the horizon
520 600 which is then actually quite a
sizable gap over the 8400 so the 8400
actually if it's one thing to come out
of this it's very power efficient and
for gaming it's very relevant and the
reason being is because you can save
money on a power supply as well you
don't have to go out and buy a 650 watt
Gold rated power supply you can get away
with a 450 watt bronze rated power
supply with an 8400 and then couple in a
decent GPU your Holman hos gtx 1070
whatever if you're coming at gtx 1070
with the x-15 675 for example then i
would recommend maybe going with a 550
or 650 watt power supply just to be on
the safe side so there's that difference
to consider and also of course the power
savings that you will save on your power
bill if for instance you're playing
World of Warcraft for eight hours a day
that will add up over time and will save
you a little bit of money not to mention
it will make your room a little bit
cooler when it's all said and done that
we have here the six cores versus six
cores versus six cores with the best GPU
available to consumers at the moment
that is the GTX 280 Ti and where does
this leave my old school favorite CPU
and motherboard combination of all time
well actually leaves it in a really good
spot because every time I've picked up
an X 58 motherboard I've picked it up
for an absolute bargain now of course
the X 56 75 you can pick them up off
Aliexpress if you want to pay market
rates pick up for like 40 50 dollars
they do go down in times in price to
like $30 off eBay I've seen sales for
them so for that money for the CPU
itself it's phenomenal value for money
there's no denying that not only that
you can go get cheap ddr3 memory which a
lot of people just give away practically
with PCs or they sell on local listings
for very cheap and then you've got
yourself the base for a very potent
gaming machine keep in mind we tested
with a 1080i we can step down to a gtx
1070 and these differences that you see
between the 8400 and the rise of our
2600 in the x-15 675 they'll even become
that much insignificant to the point
where it's not going to make a
difference at all of course as much
sentimental value as x58 has in the hype
that I do here on the channel for it
going new is what most people will want
to do you've got your new features like
USB front out head of pcie 3.0 RGB
lighting a lot of the times not only
that you've got more power efficiency
and warranty available of parts
breakdown generally used parts you only
get a couple of months because that's
what you paid for on eBay or you paid
from PayPal but if you're getting local
deals well the time you've got no
warranty at all so you do that run that
risk but one thing that I've never
talked about before with x58
one thing that does make it kind of even
more special is the fact that a lot of
people bought x58 motherboards with the
i7 920 and that's a fork or eight
threaded part and they didn't overclock
at all and so these motherboards have
been babied their whole life and I will
say one thing about most x58
motherboards they were built
phenomenally well they were built to
handle six cores to all threads
overclocked so if you find one and it's
a good price I generally snap it up that
would be my advice with the Westmere six
core 12 threaded Zeon's on those x58
motherboards they did surprise me they
are still relevant so if people do call
them irrelevant I want you guys to point
them to this video here because they can
still get up and boogie in 2018 even if
you're streaming even if you're playing
games with a 1080 Ti the Altima leaf
it's one thing to come out of today's
video it's that I don't think CPUs have
come that far at all in the last 10
years in fact a lot of these power
efficiency improvements that you're
seeing have probably come from the fact
that we've gone from 45 nanometer down
to 32 nanometer in the case of the
Westmere CPUs then down to 22 nanometer
and down to 14 nanometer on Intel side
of things rosin 2600 is now on 12
nanometer - so that's where you're going
to get a lot of those power saving
features from in terms of raw
architectural improvements I don't think
we've seen a whole lot as opposed the
GPU side of things when Nvidia for
example went from Kepler to Maxwell I
thought there was a massive difference
in power efficiency and also that
enabled them to then extract more gains
