or can it
so ever since I've started making videos
for you guys I've been using a
professional rendering application
namely Adobe Premiere Pro and that's had
support for CUDA and I've never gotten
around to testing and I've just never
bothered I always thought it made or it
gave a significant advantage over not
having it on however recently with the
r9 290 coming in from AMD or gigabyte I
recently I decided to test that in Vegas
Pro because Vegas Pro uses OpenCL and
that's known to support AMD graphics
cards so essentially you can use your
graphics card to help render a video and
so basically I decided to get the GTX
970 that I have here and then get the r9
290 and then use it on my testbed which
is a 5820k from intel and i7 5820k
that's clocked at 4.2 gigs and I decided
to run some apples to apples test to see
how these graphics cards or these gaming
graphics cards did in the real world so
let's move on now to the benchmarks so
first up here we have Vegas Pro 13 now
this is just a trial edition I
downloaded so I got to use this program
for 30 days but that's all I needed to
run the tests I did I decided to render
a four minute and 38 second video the
output was 1080p best quality and as we
can see here the CPU only so when I set
the CPU to only that scored four minutes
and 38 seconds so that one that beat
both the GTX 970 and the r9 290 and now
the iron 290 was overclocked as well so
this was OpenCL and I believe the GTX
970 uses CUDA in this application so
when I use the GTX 970 that's called 5
minutes and 6 seconds and the uh 9290
scored 4 minutes and 50 seconds so the
CPU only was the best way to go if I use
my gaming graphics card to help Brenda
it made no difference at all so I don't
know what's going on here in Vegas Pro
maybe there's some setting extra
settings I need to do but essentially a
gaming graphics card like a high-end
gaming graphics card was useless in this
application so Vegas Pro 13 did not make
a difference how about Premiere Pro cs6
which uses the Merc
engine now this engine support scooter
and so when I did these tests I was
surprised as well my gaming graphics
card the GTX 970 only sped up times by
12 seconds that's right so it's scored 4
minutes and 45 seconds versus the CPU
only which scored 4 minutes and 57
seconds
and so this surprised me because like
again just like Vegas Pro the gaming
graphics card practically made no
difference at all when it came to making
the render times faster I decided just
for curiosity as you guys know what
about what about if we disabled some
cause what about if I had a GTX 970 on a
dual-core how would that go and so this
is the test I did I decided to disable
four cores on my58 20k and just have two
cores running at 4.2 gigs with the GTX
970 again CUDA support enabled and what
I found here is we got 622 seconds or 10
minutes and 22 seconds so again the CPU
was the most important part in this
equation and so it surprised me actually
so essentially if you guys want to drop
your render times then you might want to
think about getting a better CPU or
getting a professional-grade GPU I mean
the gaming graphics cards they just
didn't make a difference when it came to
dropping render times and I looked
around the internet I tried to find as
much information as I could but I just
couldn't find any real solid videos that
have compared especially 2014 graphics
cards gaming graphics cards to each
other to see which gives the best or
best results anyway so hopefully you
guys enjoyed this video but in a
nutshell yeah you want to be getting a
good CPU if you are doing professional
productivity work or you want to get a
professional graphics card because the
gaming graphics cards didn't do a great
job of reducing the times but they might
do a better job of of course maybe
giving you more display outs maybe
helping with previews whatnot so there's
other advantages to having a gaming
graphics card but I just wanted to more
pacifically test the benchmarks and the
render times and it didn't make a
difference will practically make no
difference at all and in some cases in
Vegas the pro 13 it actually was d'etre
mental to the rendering times so any
guys I hope you enjoyed this benchmark
if you did please give it a thumbs up if
you have any questions leave a comment
in the comment section below and I'll
get back to you as soon as I can and
I'll catch you guys with another tech
video very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
