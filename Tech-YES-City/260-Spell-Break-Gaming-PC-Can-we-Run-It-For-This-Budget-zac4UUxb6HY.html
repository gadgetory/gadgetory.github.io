currently in alpha and it's called spell
break and as soon as I saw this I
thought to myself why not build a used
price-performance gaming PC and see what
kind of value for money we could play
this game on and today that's exactly
what we're gonna do so let's quickly
take a look at the minimum required
specs then we'll take a look at what
we've got on the table then we'll try
and build something that can play this
game so the system requirements here are
saying that you need an i-5 44 30 or an
FX 6300 the first being a 4th Gen 4 core
Haswell CPU now on the desk we've got an
i5 4460 so this is slightly better in
the fact that it's clocked 200 megahertz
higher than the i5 44 30 if you're on
the AMD side you can use a 6 core FX
6300 then for the graphics card they're
asking to have a gtx 960 or a r7 370 now
both these cards are mid-range cards
back from those generations the GTX 970
that we've got here today is amplitudes
faster than the 960 despite it only
having a extra 10 on the naming scheme
it's also stating that you need 8
gigabytes of ddr3 memory which we've got
two gigabytes of dedicated V RAM which
we've got 3.5 so on the table here we
got a GTX 970 I've got a 500 gigabyte
hard drive 120 gigabyte SSD a gigabytes
of memory mismatched as well a lenovo h
81 motherboard and also inside that
we've got that i 5 as we mentioned
before we're gonna be using the included
cooler as well as getting this power
supply here the Kouga 500 watt so this
is a new part that i'm going to be using
in this build and i've also got to go
pick up a new case from the local
retailer but they do these cases super
cheap and i'll show you soon so with our
set we don't have to give a whole lot of
parts here tech yes loving because we've
already given that graphics card some
tech yes loving in a previous video
where we took at the GTX 970 in 2019
I'll put that link up here if you want
to check it out but other than that we
really only have to give the RAM
motherboard CPU cooler hard drive an SSD
some cleansing so let's quickly do that
now and then stop the build
just go back now from the computer store
and we picked up one of these for $35 so
it's actually a really good price
considering it's got a 12 centimeter LED
fan which is blue in this case at the
front of the case so all we have to do
to add a bit more bling is another $1
LED strip and we're good to go so we're
waiting for let's put this thing
together
so here's the build all complete here
we've got the blue LED at the front with
the blue LED strip and it was unintended
but it actually matches up with the wind
force gtx970 g1 which has a blue wind
force led logo now this whole build it
tallied up to around about 370 ozzie
dollars which is like 262 u.s. d
adjusted so it came out a little bit
more expensive because we had to use a
new power supply in case because I
couldn't find any deals on cases and
power suppliers on gumtree well I did
find a case but it just looks so bad to
the point where it will detract away
from value from the build if we go to
flip it blow out a slide let's start
installing windows tune this thing up
and then run some spell break and see
how it performs
so the spell break gaming PC looks like
it's been breaking some spells with the
fancy LED lights but the performance was
pretty impressive at 1080p high settings
in window mode we were getting over 80
average fps and I think the one percent
and point one percent lows were sort of
going a little bit wild sometimes and I
guess again that's because the games in
alpha when I first booted up this game
it did have a problem where it only
allowed me to put 1080p in windowed mode
so full screen and borderless window
sort of having some problems so it is a
indeed a alpha game still but it is
pretty fun I mean getting into it sort
of like it's got a little bit of a
learning curve but it is a battle royale
type game and instead you've got spells
and you can start off with a basic thing
and you get gauntlets and use special
spells I mean for me it was just
personally just things were all over the
map I managed to get my character with
some invisibility thing and that was
pretty cool but somehow people still
knew where I was and just sort of jammed
me from behind
but speaking of jam we did indeed jam a
lot in this case and the problem is it's
only got that one fan at the front which
has weak airflow so it's pretty much a
sarcophagus inside here and the
temperatures on the GPU was showing like
89 degrees max and admittedly I did
overclock the GPU and I was surprised it
didn't crash out at these temperatures
but the easiest thing to do with a case
like this is to just remove the side
panel and that will let the hot air vent
out and you should be getting much lower
temperatures the spell break it ran
really smoothly 1080p high settings the
game does look pretty promising I think
I'm not sure if it's free-to-play but I
got sent a key on Twitter from skilled
rebuild so big thank you to skilled
rebuilds for sending us that key and
also we played apex legends on this
gaming PC right here and it did pretty
well I mean we're getting over 60 FPS on
high settings 1080p the CPU and the GPU
just had perfect synergy at these
settings pretty much 100% on the GPU
100% on the CPU for cause there with the
i-5 for
for 60 but now back to spell break in
terms of the minimum specifications
they're pretty much right on the money I
guess in terms of the CPU this is about
where you'd want your CPU to be in
getting over 60fps and having a smooth
experience because to my eyes it was a
pretty smooth experience even though the
1% point one percent lows was sort of
showing some occasional stuttering it
was still a good experience on this PC
but the GPU was still maxed pretty much
a hundred percent all the time so that
gtx 960 recommendation is probably a
solid recommendation to get 1080p low
and medium settings GTX 970 again being
a lot more powerful than the 960 so all
that aside we got a build here they came
in pretty cheap still has that new look
and still uses a new power supply but it
is doing very well for the price tag
around 260 US dollars 370 Aussie dollars
and I think in this case the part where
we extracted the most value out of this
build was the motherboard a gigabytes of
RAM the CPU cooler and that combo for
the hard drive all thrown in there we
got that for around 160 Aussie dollars
and it just screams value at this price
point because this motherboard does work
with the GTX 970
but on top of that it also came with a
Windows 10 Pro Licence pre-activated
so I didn't have to go out and buy a
Windows 10 key on top of that and really
it all just came together to make run
really smooth gaming PC honestly though
if using this every single day I'd
either be changing out the fans which in
this case high airflow fans do cost a
bit of money they will add to the cost
of the build or you just simply take the
side panel off in that case it does look
pretty clean I even though we're still
using ketchup and mustard cables the
build came out alright but on that note
guys let us know in the comments section
below what you think of this gaming PC
right here and also let us know what you
think of cheap cases do you utilize them
especially if they got LED fans like
this they do bling it up a little bit
they do create value I think when it
comes to flipping the PC but also on
that note let us know in a comment
section below what you think of spell
break have you played the game yet seems
a little bit exciting it's definitely a
little bit of a battle royale twist
compared to the other battle Royales out
there but me personally man I'm just
getting battle Roy
out at the moment there's so many of
these games coming out I just I'm losing
track
I sort of enjoy a bit of a single-player
game and a sort of different like RTS
game and I'm just really hanging for Age
of Empires for but as me personally
maybe hopefully Microsoft will update
that later this year but other than that
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
did be sure to hit that like button and
also if you're enjoying the content you
want to see at the moment of drops be
sure to hit that sub button with that
notification belt turned on if you want
that inside scoop head over to Instagram
context yes city and I'll catch you guys
in another tech video very soon peace
out for now BAE
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
