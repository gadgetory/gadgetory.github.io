joined by Justin how you feeling man no
I'm good good long weekend but hanging
in there it's hanging in this so we're
going to talk about some recently
released for ser products as well
something crazy going on in the
background I guess they're just excited
about corsair products on that side so
probably seeing these new sexy cases
coming out from Causton we got to talk
about this one right behind us with the
10 big last year so this one's called
them for 60 x it's the very first from
our crystal series we has a front
tempered glass and the side timer glass
as well it comes with three fans it's
called the sp120 RGB it has a fan
controller on top and you can switch
settings I think seven different
profiles that you can do so that's seven
different profiles you got the tempered
glass that definitely a trend coming in
on the pc gaming market a lot of people
on those bigger cases want that tempered
glass me myself included I love that
tempered glass look I think the next
case I get will be tempered glass is
that coming out on a lot of other cases
from corsair as well there will be a
next one i'm not sure if i can say
anything about it just yet but let me
talk about the 460 real quick so the
front can handle three 120 fans up to
three hundred sixty millimeter radiator
and on top you can handle 2 143 120 and
a 280 rad um it comes with a psu shark
officers PS you and your hard drive and
your SSD goes on the other side so you
have a really clean build on this clean
a tempered glass so you got the open
case there you've got the air flow going
through you've got the cable management
options you got that su sure out there
and you've also got what you need I
guess a small form I guess it's for what
it is it is pretty small right it is a
mid-tower but it can support up to e ATX
form factor and then sorry then you got
those options there for the water
cooling as well so it is pretty much a
fully featured case in a mid-sized ATX
case definitely and cooling on this is
fantastic as a side vents on the side
definitely an air filter on the front as
well
maintenance is a breeze so they've
alleviated a lot of problems from
previous cases and you've also just got
one hell of a case here very sexy if I
might add so here we are now the next
product we got on display here from
corsair RGB LED mouse pads now I've
never seen anything like this it looks
very clean looks very good if you're
into those RGB mouse anything lgb I
guess so what is this thing exactly so
this one is called the MM 800 Polaris
and it's an RGB mouse pad which has 15
LEDs each zone you can customize two
different colors in however you want and
using the q2 software we're actually
launching a q2 for pax prime it's an
updated version of the coarser utility
engine you can fully customize your
peripherals using one software wow so
you can sync everything up your keyboard
your mouse and even your mouse pad now
so it looks like corsair definitely
taking a front there on the cosmedix yes
also i would like to mention q2 will
have a much friendlier interface as for
before you needed the learning curve on
it is pretty high which this one's
pretty straightforward click and point
and you're good to go so right next to
these mouse pads now I'm looking at
these very popular keyboards especially
the k70 in the k95 I mean in particular
I have tried the k95 loved it I thought
it was a great keyboard very solid had
those cherry MX switches in there any
update on when we can expect I guess a
refresh on these keyboards or even a new
model coming out well actually Lux we
just launched it's a refresh of the old
key 70 it seen it saw has MX switches it
just has an updated font which the line
like from the LED which shines through
it more vividly it's more rich also a
better LED control so response time
everything is updated so i guess if it
already works and you don't need a fix
it right exile you just refresh and then
make it better basically so this loft
space behind me on what really caught me
by surprise and i wanted to talk about
it was the air 740 which is actually the
successor to the s5 40 years so that's
where i got the numbers right yes you
did so we're introducing the air 748 at
PAX Prime so it's it has it still has
the same build chamber same as the 540
so the left side will have the main
components that generate the most heat
which is a motherboard GPU cpu and
memory
and the other side will have the power
supply and your storage it's a lot
bigger it's out actually better and
better in a sense of cooling wise
because you can look load it up with
radiators on top bottom and in the front
to essentially I guess you could call it
a little bit of a bigger air 540 because
the air 540 I knew that thing was a very
good case indeed like I had that
push-pull configuration just blew out
the heat completely I mean I remember
seeing one on display i was like wow
this thing is definitely keeping your
components cool so the last thing we're
going to talk about with the sm 40 is
the aggressive style but also the noise
i noticed this thing is extremely quiet
i mean i can drop this mic right up here
and you'll probably just hear background
noise and this is on a dynamic mic so
that's something that's really I guess
Coursera taking into heart right with
this case not just the looks but also
the noise reduction there yes these are
available there are called the Maglev
fans ml 120 s 1 and available in 140 s
as well we just dropped them we launched
them at computex this year and it can
run at a higher RPM with less noise from
a standard fan yeah definitely so you've
got the higher rpm less noise going into
this case or at least an option to go
into this case so you can have the
better looks bigger space there with the
air 740 and obviously the lower noise so
very clean now and lastly I noticed on
the front of the case here we got an LED
light switch what's that all about with
the SM 40 so that's going to go with our
SP or HD RGB that comes with a
controller if you buy the 3-pack it
comes with a fan control and you can
manually switch the light profiles
externally so you don't have to go to a
software to change all the lighting all
the settings and everything so basically
if you have OCD you'll be completely
covered with this case exactly I think
with any other product I've seen here
today if you guys have OCD corsair have
the perfect solution thought for you so
I would like to thank Justin for taking
the time out for this interview today
and if you guys have any questions or
comments be sure to drop a call in the
comment section below and I will get
back to you as soon as I can hope to see
you in another tech video very soon and
I'll catching the next one any closing
words Justin go Chris air and Christmas
is definitely going to be good around
this booth brothers
besides that we've also got a very
clean-looking case what was a inspire
that I sir and then besides that we've
also got yep it's a case on display here
at the moment so for pax prime work like
for blue business is going to be real on
this one so my zabal to each each sorry
good that's right we're at refresh with
the case 70s which are called the k70
lux it has a modern font so light
strength choice through it more oh yes
that we're gonna come on get back on
track</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
