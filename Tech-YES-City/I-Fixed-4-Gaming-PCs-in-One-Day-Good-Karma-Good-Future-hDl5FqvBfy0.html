Next Horizon Gaming in L.A.
and flew back, we're now in the
beautiful land of Australia.
I'm at Brisbane International Airport,
got a direct flight back,
but that's not gonna stop me
from doing some Tech Yes after care.
Now when you sell a gaming P.C.,
there's always good karma.
Good karma equals a good
future, and that's what I do.
So for someone who buys a computer off me,
I wanna make sure they
have a great experience
from start to finish.
And so today we're gonna actually fix
a couple of computers of up,
cause while I was on holidays,
I got some messages and this
actually started from Computex.
I just did not have a
chance since Computex
and this L.A. event,
but now I'm gonna do a
bit of Tech YES Lovin'
to some of these PCs,
make sure they're working all okay
and also try and pick up some deals
while I'm up in Brisbane,
since Brisbane is a city
that's about an hour
drive from where I live.
Since I'm getting picked up here,
I thought, might as well just keep going,
regardless of how
jet-lagged or sleepy I am.
(rock music)
So just finished up with
that first PC repair
and I guess I wouldn't call it a repair,
it was actually my own bad,
I sold a PC during Computex
and I accidentally left a
four core Ryzen CPU in there.
So I've now changed over to a six core,
and I got the four core right here,
but I am right around the
corner from Lez's house.
And now if you guys watched
the used monthly parts hunts,
you'll know that Lez is
a regular that I go to,
and it would be a cardinal
sin to not drop in
at 7:30 a.m. in the
morning and pay him a visit
if I was right around the area.
So that's exactly what we're gonna do.
Also there's an awesome
cafe in the back here,
I'm just gonna quickly go get
some breakfast and chow down.
(mellow electronic music)
So just got out of Lez's place
and he always takes good care of me.
I've got eight monitors
that are like 22 inch to 23 inch screens.
We've got three PCs and we also got
a 4GB stick of memory
and three hard drives.
Now this is pretty important
here, this stick of memory,
because I just got back from the airport
and I'm on the road up at Brisbane,
and I've got a screwdriver,
and I now gotta go fix another PC,
and I've just picked up
the parts for that PC.
So you guys can see already
that I'm making things work
on the road, proper hustling.
but also on that note, how did America go
in terms of getting the deals over there?
We'll talk about that when
I get back to the studio
with real talk, but you can see here,
I've got a little bit of
an itch I need to scratch
in terms of hustling and
we'll talk about that too.
But let's move on now
to the next location,
get the work done and then get back
to the studio with this whole.
(mellow electronic music)
So now the last place,
this is called Ipswich,
and the person who I
went to fix their PC up,
they're unfortunately at work,
which is understandable
since it is a Thursday.
But I'm actually at my sister's home,
which is literally like two
minutes around the corner,
so I've just put the
replacement parts at her place
and the guy who needs the parts fixed up,
can just come and pick them
up after he finishes work.
So that's that problem solved,
and also while I'm here,
and my sister's a little bit camera shy,
but she's wanted to show me her chickens
and she reckons they're awesome
'cause you can feed them anything
and then they'll turn anything into eggs.
Now that's kinda like, very
similar to the Tech YES story,
you take trash and you
turn it into treasure.
But our last stop is now the Gold Coast,
so let's get this hustle
back to the Tech YES studio.
(mellow electronic music)
So here's all the hustle here on the desk,
unloaded in all its glory.
You can see there, a massive score,
but in about half an
hour there is another PC
that's coming here to the Tech YES studio
to get a quick patch up.
So we'll detail that very soon,
but before we do, we'll quickly sit down
and do some real talk with you guys.
So you guys are probably
sitting there wondering
like what the f-- this
guy just got off a plane,
14 hour flight and he's in there,
he's already hustling
again, like have a break.
And this is where we get
down to that argument
of introvert, extrovert,
you know the extrovert
will get charged in terms of energy
when they go out in public
and they socialize and stuff,
and the introvert's the opposite,
they'll be in their man
cave or wherever they are,
and they'll charge their energy
via being inside that introverted space.
For me, I'm sort of a
different brand all together,
I like to think of
myself as a hustler-vert,
and so when I start
hustling and getting deals,
that's my energy getting charged up again.
And when I docked into
L.A., I was so jet lagged
'cause I'd just come off Computex,
uploaded heap of content
for you guys in the meantime
when I got back for the three day break,
so I hope you guys enjoyed some
of that content coming out,
like the 1903 update
and some other videos.
But I docked into L.A.
at like the worst time,
I came in at seven in the morning
and I'd been up all the
day before in Australia,
which we then flew back in day.
It was kind of weird, like Back
to the Future kind of stuff,
and I went to the hotel and I crashed out
and then I woke up like 7 p.m..
So my body clock was already messed up
by the time I got to
L.A. for the AMD event.
And then the whole weekend
I was covering that event,
I didn't get any time to sort
of step outside and hustle,
though as soon as I got in
and I woke up that night,
I was on Facebook marketplace,
and I already lined up
some really good deals,
the problem is, is that
my Bank of America card,
there was this mix-up
where they sent it out
to the wrong address so
my friend didn't have it.
So I couldn't get any USD out,
so I was literally left
with a sticky situation
where I couldn't even pick up these deals,
but it was weird because I did negotiate
two Ryzen 5 2600s for $100 USD a pop,
and also found a Vega
56 I think for $180 USD,
as well as a whole PC for about $280,
and I think that had some
really good specs inside
like an RX580 and a Ryzen CPU too.
So I was lining up a
really special hustle,
but it just didn't come to
realization due to those factors
of me not being able to get a car
'cause no one at the event
had a ride that I could borrow
and I was like look,
can I give someone here
a couple of bucks so I
can just take their car
and quickly get some deals in
and everyone there was like,
no we ain't got access to
a car and I was like okay.
So I'm not really gonna get an
Uber and go all around L.A.,
'cause that would sort of beat the purpose
of getting deals in the first place.
Where those deals will end up
costing twice as much
as they usually would,
but Los Angeles always has
really good deals going on.
And that was with me on the marketplace
for like nine minutes,
I think I screen recorded
the whole session.
So that's how easy it is to
get deals if you're in L.A.
There's also OfferUp as well,
but unfortunately on my smartphone,
because it's Australian
based, I can't use that app.
I'm gonna try a work
around where I use a VPN
on my phone the next time I'm there,
but hopefully I made up for
all of that and then some
with all these deals on the table here.
Let's go and fix this PC
and then we may even have
to fix up one more PC
later in the afternoon
before we come back to a conclusion.
(mellow electronic music)
So that PC ended up coming in
and it was the quickest
fix of my life for a PC
because it looked like it
was working absolutely fine,
which means that the person
who bought the PC off me
probably has an issue elsewhere
with something a faulty monitor cable
or even a faulty monitor.
So that was kind of
good to see in my case,
but kind of if there's still problems
existing for that person,
I said that I would make
a trip to their place
and fix it up afterwards.
'Cause you've always gotta
keep the customer happy
with that Tech YES after care.
So with that problem done and dusted,
I am waiting on a reply
for the last problem here
that I have to go fix up.
But if I do, then I'll
quickly get on the road
and take you guys with us,
we can check out what's
wrong, fix that computer too,
but in the mean time, I do
need some Tech YES Lovin',
which this pillow on this
couch is going to provide.
(rock music)
(mellow electronic music)
So it's now 8:30 p.m., just got back
from finishing the last fix
of the Tech YES after care.
And that ended up being
really, really weird,
in fact, it was such a weird problem,
I haven't encountered it yet.
And to let you guys know what happened,
first of all, changed
the motherboard over,
changed the power supply over,
brought a different graphics card,
it was still having problems initially.
Like I had brought two sticks
of memory over that were 8GB,
cause there were four 4GB
memory sticks in there.
And so after a bit of troubleshooting,
I then went into the BIOS
and noticed the memory was at 1600 MHz.
A CL10, which is fine,
but a command rate of one,
and now one thing with the command rate,
having it set at one, especially
with four sticks of memory,
is it's very strenuous on the
integrative memory controller
on the CPU, and so the 3770
being one of those CPUs
that went from 32 nanometer
just down to 22 nanometer,
it was at the stage where
this could present a problem
of not a rapidly degrading CPU,
but a CPU that's degrading,
especially on the IMC side,
faster than otherwise usual.
So this PC was like it's six months
out of warranty or something,
but again I still like
to take care of people,
so what I did was I
then dropped the memory
down to CL2, command rate of two,
and everything was up and running again.
So that's something I've
learned in that CL1,
it can, especially like
I said just before,
four sticks of memory installed
in a motherboard of the CPU,
it can degrade that IMC.
So something to look
out for in the future.
I didn't even think of it
when I initially put this PC together,
but it is something to look out for,
if that automatic, 'cause
that's what it booted up with,
it automatically
defaulted to those timings
and sub-timings on the memory
when I initially built this PC.
So that was really crazy,
something that took me
a couple of hours
actually to troubleshoot,
'cause I had to change
a lot of things over
and then finally got to
the bottom of the problem.
One thing at a time, and
I guess that was sort of
the most bizarre problem I've had yet.
With that said guys, today
we have done so much,
we've hustled a whole table full of deals,
we've fixed up four computer problems
for people who have had issues.
And on top of that, I
still managed to crash out
for a couple of hours on the couch.
And from here on in, I'm going
to actually eat some dinner,
have a shower and then
crash out yet again.
Get a big night's rest 'cause
I've just been traveling
in this last two weeks to Taiwan
and then to L.A. for the AMD event,
and I'm absolutely spent.
So I think tomorrow I might just take it
a little bit easier than usual,
and I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.
If you did then be sure to
hit that like button for us.
But let us know in the
comments section below,
what is the weirdest problem you've had
when it comes to dealing with PCs.
This one here today, I think
that tops the charts for me
as I kind of have seen it
slightly before in the past
when I was dealing with that 4770K
that was de-lidded and
stuttering from Italy.
If you guys haven't seen that
video, I'll put it up here.
But it is weird to see
this problem creep up
with a 3770 at 1600 MHz,
especially when that CPU
is rated to 1600 MHz.
I guess the CL1, that command
rate of 1t on those timings,
is very strenuous on the CPU's IMC.
But anyway guys, I'm
gonna get on out of here,
I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon.
Peace out for now, bye.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
