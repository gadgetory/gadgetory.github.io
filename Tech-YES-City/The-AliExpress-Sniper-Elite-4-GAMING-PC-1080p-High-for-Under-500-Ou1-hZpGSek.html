for a long time you guys have been
asking me to build a youth PC where you
could also get similar parts to similar
prices and although I couldn't source
the whole build with use parts I was
able to source three main components
from the website called aliexpress.com
and the results are pretty damn good
welcome back at tech city this is brian
coming to you guys today with a video on
used meet you that is I use both use
parts and you pass in a PC to bring you
guys something that is a bit of alright
and also can play games at 1080p with
smooth frame rates though let's take a
look at the main components that make
this build
first up the x34 70 which is a 4 core 8
threaded Xeon because around 52 USD
shipped send the motherboard which is a
H 55 A+ from bio stock which is around
60 USD then there is a gigabytes of ddr3
memory for about 46 USB other parts used
we're all new and wood picked up locally
from a computer store d'italia build
cost of around 493 USD or 637 Australian
dollars though anyway with cost with
slide let's build this thing and show
you guys what it can do in games
yeah
yeah yeah yeah girl don't need all the
answers to tell me when I safar one day
I'm I wake up with a reaper at the door
don't need all the answers just to
anything it all having a poem in another
waiting on you call me anything
Nanako rise I wanna hear boy
I think I'd be better
Oh
I think it'd be better so there it is
guys the aliexpress.com used meets new
Sniper Elite gaming PC and Wow did it
really impress me how smooth some of the
older hardware can still be though I
will say I wasn't happy about the
overclock for this motherboard could
only take the X 3472 3.5 5 gigahertz as
the motherboard was very limiting and
even though the CPU has a high turbo
multiplier of 24 times I could only go
to the 22 times multiplier on all caused
on this particular motherboard I only
had two options to go for overclocking 2
which was very limiting and the
motherboard topped out at a base clock
of 161 mega before instability kicked in
the RS 470 however of course is always a
nice graphics card for the money and
easily handle anything I threw it at at
1080p high settings f1 2016 and Sniper
Elite 4 played really well too and Cisco
also got some high frame rates for those
people who loved fierce go multi so as
for the comparison to the G 45 60 which
is Intel's latest i3 budget killer
welp stay tuned for that and I will be
comparing them directly to see if this
use price performance in this video can
handle today's G 4560 build hey guys
before i get out here i will say that
buying you spots generally carries more
of a risk than buying new pots when you
take it to warranty and also in my
opinion parts are more likely to not
work and if you were to buy them new so
with that said this is a really awesome
PC for the money and I'll catch you guys
in another tech video very soon peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
