we are cloning one drive to another and
we're going to be using Western Digital
Akron as' software it's actually really
good
welcome back to techy our city ladies
and gentlemen this is brian coming back
to you guys today with a quick tutorial
on how to clone a drive from one to
another now the reasons you might want
to do this can vary anything from a hard
drive that's on its way out and it's
performance is lackluster and you want
to keep your whole OS the way it is and
you want to save a lot of time or you're
just simply upgrading to an SSD or in my
case you're actually downgrading from an
SSD to a hard drive because you want to
sell the selected rig and that's what
I'm doing so I don't want to keep this
SSD because it's really good anyway that
being said we're going to get a program
called Western Digital Akron as'
software and it's a free download and
it's very easy to use so let's get on
with the tutorial anyway so the first
thing you will want to do is head over
to the website West noodles web site
where you can download the akron estroux
image Western Digital Editions software
I'll put the link in the description
below so you can just directly go there
and get it you will need a Western
Digital hard drive in order to use this
software and it is 260 megabytes in file
size so if you got slow internet keep
that in mind that it might take a little
bit of time to download though it's got
different languages there so if you
prefer another language you can choose
that as well but after you've downloaded
it you can then begin to install the
program now quickly before we begin the
installation I will say make sure you
copy all your important files off the
destination Drive that's the drive that
you're copying all your information to
so make sure you do this before you
start cloning okay so now we can start
installing the software so you just
pretty much double click on it click yes
and then click install and just also
accept the license agreement click Next
click Next again and then click proceed
and the install takes awhile even on
pretty fast computers as well so keep
that in mind and we'll just quickly skip
to it being installed and then after
you've installed it I will stress though
quickly make sure that you have backed
up all the files on the drive that
you're copying the software to however
that being said let's move on now so
it's pretty much easy once you have
installed software open it up and
there's an option there called cloned
disk and you just click on that so we
just click on
and disk bang automatic it's easy
automatics actually really good gets
everything right from the get-go
so since this is a tutorial as well I'm
just going to be recommending automatic
and so you just click Next and then
we're on to the next section here where
we will pretty much be today as I said
in the intro I will be copying my SSD so
the SSD is actually the OS drive so
that's the source disk so this is the
one where your OS is installed on so
this is currently your source so you
just select that which was the crucial
SSD and then we want to copy it to the
Western Digital one terabyte drive and
that's the destination drive this is the
drive that I've backed up and so for
this step I will have to get off desktop
recording software and I'll have to move
over to my camera now to the for the
next step so now that we've backed up
all our data from our destination disk
we can then proceed so basically this
next part it will get it ready to clone
and so you can see here that it's got
the drive ready so it's got my hard disk
drive yes I'm copying I'm cloning my SSD
to my hard disk drive as I said in the
intro though it's probably not a common
thing and you can see here the software
pretty much gets it all ready for you it
will actually fill out the drive as well
so it'll fill out all the data and make
a bigger petition since the SSD is only
256 gigs compared to the hard drive
which is one terabyte it's going to
clone that SSD to the hard drive and
then it's going to fill out the rest of
that space on the same petition so if
you have a smaller drive that you're
cloning to just keep in mind that you
might run into some problems though as
we can see here the software is pretty
much restarting it's going to go through
all the paces of cloning the disk and
that's about all there is to it so it's
a really easy to use program it's really
good really simple and it works
perfectly as well so I've cloned two
times now and it's worked both times
flawlessly so with that being said let's
move on now to a conclusion
so in conclusion that's all there is to
it very easy it's pretty much a few
clicks of a button though one thing keep
in mind that the destination drive make
sure you pull all your important files
off at first I go go to keep stressing
that and another thing is - you may wish
to install chipset drivers reinstall
chipset drivers and graphics card
drivers
that's up to you that's something that I
like to do personally just to make sure
everything's working perfectly anyways I
hope you enjoyed this tutorial if you
did please give it a big thumbs up if
you have any questions or comments and
drop a comment in the comment section
below and I'll get back to you as soon
as I can
peace out for now bye or environment and
so today I'm going to try some
real-world conditions touch these parts
and see if the computers well the
computer still boots up so first up here
we have the Seagate hard drive so I'm
just going to quickly charge myself put
it in the computer see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
