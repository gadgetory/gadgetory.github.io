if you do then this is the video for you
welcome back to tech air city this is
bryan coming to you guys today with a
video for the month of june 2016 where
i'm picking out some of the hottest
deals on either ebay or amazon and with
that being said let's get on with the
first deal here we have the e5 2630 v4
broadwell e proc here this is a cpu that
comes in at 225 dollars there's only one
left naturally I've already bought
myself one of these CPUs is getting
shipped to me at the moment but
essentially this is the broad well II 10
core 20 threaded beast and in this
particular screenshot that the guys
shown here this thing turbos all the way
up to 3.1 gigahertz now what this means
is if you've got a good motherboard that
supports the CPU make sure that your
motherboard supports the CP if you're
going to get this if you is that it will
overclock you'll be able to get the big
clock adjustment and get this thing up
to around maybe 3.3 even 3.4 possibly
and what this means is that you've got
yourself now aight cheap 6950 x
contender the next year we've got up
here is the Razer Taipan this is my new
daily driver mouse I love this thing
I've been using for a couple of months
now since I've been looking for a true
successor to my logitech G 3 and this
thing I'm happy to say is pretty much a
true successor with an absolutely
phenomenal sensor on board there that
tracks really well even at 4k gaming and
also the software to go with it's
actually pretty good as well will
remember your settings even though it's
kind of like a cloud-based server though
with all that out of the way this mouse
has a really good build quality and I
can't recommend it enough though I will
say that I am a fingertip gripper so i
can recommend it to fellow fingertip
grippers i like Christmas trees do you
like Christmas trees well if you do this
next deal i have for you is the seeds
$50 RGB blue switch mechanical keyboard
and all's I can say is at fifty dollars
it's a pretty good bye even though the
looks might not suit some people you're
still getting that RGB backlighting and
those blue switches which I can't
recommend enough if you're typing for
long sessions or if you're gaming as
well now the next deal i have up here is
sort of like a motherboard and cpu combo
we got the msi h81 and motherboard here
gone for thirty seven dollars with free
shipping now you couple that with the i3
4150 that's also going for a
dolls from one seller you've got one
capable motherboard and cpu combo all
for the low price of one hundred and
thirty-seven dollars pretty damn good
now if you're looking for a GPU to
couple that with there's a 100-dollar
750ti gone at the moment on amazon as
well though if you are patient i would
recommend waiting out for amd's entry
budget level cards which are rumored to
come out in a month which will really
bring some kickass price performance to
this budget gaming graphics market so no
guys that's about it for me today if you
like this video of this new sort of
series that I want to bring to the
channel show you guys some of those
awesome deals then be sure to show your
support by hitting that like button if
you have any questions or comments about
these deals or anything in particular if
you just want to say a Brian I want to
give you an e-hug and drop a comment the
comment section below bro we can have an
e-hug it's all good and I'll catch you
in the next video very soon peace out
for now bye
