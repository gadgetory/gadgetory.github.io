goes somewhere along the lines of oh you
get free stuff this must be super easy
for you so today I figured well why not
show everyone what goes on behind the
scenes everything in order to get the
video from start to finish
and produced and also produced in a
manner that people would want to watch
it so we've got the budget PC the under
$300 build and I'm gonna tell you guys
through a behind the scenes look at what
goes into making a video like this not
to mention after we do this video
there's then a heap of all the videos
that have to get done so let's begin
so the first thing we want to do is make
sure all the pricing is ready and it's
all accurate because prices do change
all the time so for the American Bill
we're looking at around 275 u.s. and
then for the Aussie build 383 and the
notes actually quite a bit more
expensive in Australia so that's what
we've got there okay so I didn't even
spec in the price of the motherboard and
so Dom this is the camera gear that
we're gonna use to film it so this is
the b-roll camera it's the sony a6300 a
really good camera especially even if
you want to use this for your main shots
for using it for shooting subjects it's
an absolutely phenomenal camera
especially in terms of value for money
and that's sort of like that's going to
take some b-roll of this all these
products right here so it wise will
quickly shoot that right now so we just
finished up this b-roll over here and
now we've got the main subject camera
that just knocked the camera there but
we've got the main subject camera this
is the sony a7s 2 and it's got the 25
mil f/2 baddest lens on it so this
camera I love this camera because you
can just do anything with it you don't
have to worry about lighting at all
because it's ISO will go so high and
then these are this lens here is
actually my favorite lens even though
I've got the video lens on that camera
there this lens here it just does
something magical with the shots it'll
just like slice the subject out of the
shot and it's incredible anyway we've
got here the blinds as well these are
the old-school blinds and the reason I
opted for these was simply because I can
control the amount of light that comes
in the studio so it's a real benefit for
when I want to get the shot right and
this right here is the RGB you probably
saw this before I just started recently
using this it's just an RGB controller
really gives you a good shot if you need
to so now that that's all done we're
gonna get on to shooting the first part
and that's where I talked about the
pricing and what kind of computer we're
putting together and then after that
we're going to bring it over here
and then put it on the test bench and
hook it up to this monitor start
installing some games probably says
going for night that's the main theme of
this build possibly dota 2 and see how
they perform in those games
so now we've just finished the intro
segment I've got the tripod right up
tall now so I can get the build shots
done and also people ask me about the
lavalier microphone I use this is called
the micro lab I think and it's actually
really good it sounds so neutral and I
actually have to laughs Mike's one for
the vlog cam which I'm using right now
that's the nice one and that's actually
out of stock I believe the person who
made them stop making them so I used two
lavalier microphones I'll quickly show
you here they do a phenomenal job both
of them sound really good as well for me
personally I've never been into shotgun
mics even though I know they're probably
better it's just for the sort of I just
seem to find if you don't have the setup
exactly right then you will get some
noise and it will not sound as good as a
lavalier mic which you can they're so
versatile you can use them anywhere you
wish to
so we've now just shot the b-roll as
well as the thumbnail as well I thought
okay there's a great opportunity to get
a good thumbnail here especially with
the whole kind of workbench feel and so
that's those two things done so now we
can install Windows and the games and
then test those games out so we've got
three games downloading also Windows is
updating as well so we gotta wait for
that to get done and while we get that
done I've actually gotta go see my
friend who injured himself which sucks
because he's out of work and this is
this build here this is a 980ti build so
everything you see in today's video
essentially will be a process it'll be
applied to this then we're going to do
the AMD they want me to take a look at
the non axe CPUs and what they're good
for so we're gonna do that video X
versus 9x on both those CPUs then
there's the X 470 motherboard comparison
that'll be coming up as well we've got
the 860 Evo that is for AMD wanna take a
look at storing my technology so we're
gonna take a look at that in a dedicated
video and then Intel have their own
obtained solution as well which they
wanted me to take a look at for another
video so that's the backlog essentially
there and there's still also I gotta
edit out a vlog for I am which I went to
on the weekend where the pro csgo
players just went out it for massive
amount of prize money it was actually a
really good event
alright so this video is gonna run into
tomorrow pretty much because I'm really
at latest feature update and I've
already tried the double useless offline
and that just doesn't work at least for
getting the latest feature update and
that's important with the AP used
because some reason the AP use will not
work unless you have the latest version
of Windows at least from the driver
install so weird problems but yeah this
is going to be knocked back a day this
video since this problem here is
presenting itself
so went to bed really late last night
and this piece of it actually ran really
well finished testing up all the games
and yeah three titles dota 2 csgo and
also fortnight played all those games
absolutely fine at 1080p keep in mind it
was low settings and now we're going to
put the PC on this desk here and then
get on to the final phase well after we
do the outro and that is editing the
video which actually takes up the most
time
anyway that's most of the work that goes
into a main tech s city video keep in
mind I still have to go make the
thumbnail right now do the title
description and tags and also make sure
proof check the video as well to make
sure there's no massive mistakes in that
video and this is pretty much it day in
day out this is what I do and I have to
really with that note my workflow is
I've pinned it down to efficiency I have
to as a one-man band be so efficient if
I'm not I'm not gonna be getting the
content out and of course I have to of
keep in mind that I have to get out
quality content too so efficiency is a
big thing if I'm not putting it I can't
do the whole just talk to the camera for
10 minutes straight I'm sure my viewers
who subscribe to the channel want more
than that they want content so I know I
have to deliver that day-in day-out so
it's actually really hard but yeah I now
have to do this whole process to at
least another four backlogged videos
here and of course I like to do other
things in between like a whether it be a
used build just to keep have a bit of
fun keep things going on the channel so
if you want I can show you guys my
workflow as well the Adobe Premiere Pro
workflow I've pretty much down pat got
it all these the whole workflow is
really getting perfected now of course
there will be mistakes every now and
then but I'd say at least for the
workflow that I've got in the efficiency
it's not bad considering the amount of
solid videos I can get pumped out on the
channel every eyes are gonna get back to
this go make a thumbnail make the title
the description and also the tags put in
the affiliate links as well because if
you've got product there you wise will
put affiliate links if you can because
if someone's gonna go buy a product
especially after they've watched your
video that just it doesn't hurt to put
an affiliate link in there because if
they're gonna go search on Amazon for
that product and then go buy it or if
they clicked on your link it's gonna
make absolutely no difference to them as
the end user but you'll get a kickback
so that's the awesome thing about
affiliate links and yeah guys I'll catch
you in another video very soon so if you
enjoyed this one be sure to hit that
like button and if you have any
questions or comments about
what goes on behind the scenes here then
be sure to drop a comment the comment
section below and I'll catch you guys in
and I'll take video very soon peace out
