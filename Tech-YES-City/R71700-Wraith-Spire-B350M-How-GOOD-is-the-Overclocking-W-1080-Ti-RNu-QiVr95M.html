got this for like a hundred Australian
dollars on a bargain on eBay with 20%
off and same with the are seven
seventeen hundred this was about four
hundred a strand all and it includes the
raised spire cooler so today I'm going
to be overclocking this thing and
checking just how well this thing can do
on a budget so I just got this combo in
here and you guys have been requesting
that I do some content with the more
budget orientated rising gear and today
we're just going to be doing exactly
that first up I've just got a little
graphics card that needs no PCIe
connection so I can just see how high
the overclocks go on the stock cooler
then after that we'll change things up a
little bit and see what performance we
can get out of this be 350 motherboard
which I know a lot of people are looking
to buy one of these and especially the
upcoming r5 CPUs that's the six cores on
a budget so as soon as we jump into the
BIOS here it's actually pretty hot in
this room at the moment we're talking
about 28 degrees Celsius so if anything
this is going to be a little bit of a
worst-case scenario for the B 350 but
you see here I've booted up in this
motherboard already and these are the
settings I'm getting already like I've
only spent a few minutes overclocking
this thing and I've got three point
seven five gigahertz on the rest by
Cooler I've also managed to get my
memory up to 29 33 megahertz I will try
to get it up to 3200 megahertz but
that's around about the sweet spot I
mean the max memory speeds on a be 350
or looking like this 3200 megahertz
another thing too is is that I've
noticed is that the vehicle on this
motherboard does max out around I think
it is yeah there it is this the 3.875
blog so I guess that is the limitation
of the be 350 chipset so if we do max
that voltage out how high can we go with
the risin c4 you are we actually able to
run a benchmark for instance as say 3.8
5 gigahertz which would be very good for
not just people on a budget but also for
total performance out of Rison since it
looks like the max over clocks you can
get here around about four to four point
one gigahertz so if you can get this out
of a real budget combo like this and the
value for money is just
incredible another good thing about this
bar is that you can save the
overclocking profiles so I have tried a
few different things already the
three-point-nine didn't actually work
but we're going to give the 3.85 another
try here so let's boot this up and see
how it goes so now we've booted up into
Windows we can see here the clocks are
confirmed with the latest edition of
hardware monitor here so we've got three
point eight five gigahertz so let's run
a quick Cinebench test and see if we can
do this now I am a little bit worried
about the vrm on this motherboard since
it doesn't have as many phases of the
next 370 motherboard but with that note
it does run pretty well I mean if we
chuck some heat sinks on this MOSFETs
and then we start cooling with a fan I
think we could have a really good budget
solution here especially with the cooler
going you're able to take this to three
point eight five gigahertz now would you
want to get an aftermarket cooler maybe
if you're gaming for long periods of
time and whatnot but the straights by
cooler is actually really damn good out
of the factory I can see here we go
almost 1700 SCB out of a combo that only
cost me like five hundred Australian
dollars so but at the moment the maximum
temperature we've reached was 82 degrees
Celsius in a 28 degrees Celsius
environment so this is looking pretty
good we can run it a few more times and
see just how good it is but wow man this
price performance here is just
absolutely phenomenal so I'm going to
chuck some heatsink on this motherboard
put a little fan on there and then also
throw on a GTX 1080i and just run some
benchmark of 1080p to show you guys just
how smooth the gaming performance is and
of course chucking this kind of combo
with the 1080p is absolute overkill but
it's still going to prove that the Rison
r7 on a budget is still a really good
solution for someone looking for just
great all-around performance so I've got
some little gold heat sinks here you can
get these off eBay for so cheap I think
they're around a dollar I'll put a link
in the description below anyway but you
can get different colors as well I think
I just opted for the cheapest option but
essentially what you do is you just
stick these on the mosfet though with
that said you have to be
very careful when putting these on I
usually won't recommend it if you
haven't done this before because if they
touch resistors or any other electronics
you can make things go up in smoke which
is really bad
but let's put these on the MOSFETs on
this B 350 and then try to maybe even
Chuck a fan on top of that just to help
the vrm cool down since it doesn't
actually have any passive or active
cooling on its vrm at the moment it's
just a complete naked vrm which is like
one of the worst-case scenarios for
cooling an overclocked CPU right so
we've just finished installing the
mosfet vrm heat sinks here and if we
zoom in really closely you can see this
one's at a slight angle and there's a
reason for that if we look in really
closely here we can see that that
resistance on the left and on the right
I'm just clearing both of those because
we don't want to be touching those
they're the things I warned about don't
have any metal touching those otherwise
it will cause problems but for what it's
worth it should be okay guys this should
be good to go we'll do a little quick
test run of course ready to switch off
the power supply immediately if there's
any issues so let's give this a go so we
just booted off our computer and now we
are back into Windows and it looks like
the heat sinks are doing just fine there
so there's no problems usually if
problems do occur that will occur like
immediately so keep your eye out if if
you do want to attempt one of these mods
which I don't recommend if it's your
first time building at all but this is
just for like wow what can I do on a
budget kind of thing so now we're going
to actually try and put a fan over this
and then we're also going to try and
install the ten atti and do some
benchmarking games
so I'm just doing some final tuning now
before we get on to the gaming
benchmarks and also I've noticed that
the voltage on this I was able to drop
it down by quite a bit but you can still
see here in Hardware monitor it's still
going up to pretty high levels of
voltage so it's kind of like that offset
mode has a mind of its own on this be
350 motherboard the temperatures are
looking really good keep in mind that I
did set the speed on the fans to just
cool and they're actually really quiet
at that so everything is looking pretty
sweet I actually did have to up the
system-on-chip voltage on this
motherboard just a little bit too so
that might be something that I'll have
to look into a little bit more and the
VTT
on the memory I had to boost that just a
tad as well but let's get on with those
gaming benchmarks guides because this
thing is running very sweet at the
moment
you
so there's the first benchmark there on
1080p ultra with the 1080 TI and it was
just so damn smooth it handled it really
well and you can see there the average
FPS is 134 which is insane that's really
good so it looks like the optimizations
are flowing through horizon but let's do
another couple of our benchmarks here
and just to confirm the miss things
pretty stable and it's running really
well so there it is guys another
benchmark on this rising CPU at 3.8 5
gigahertz and the results are just
really impressive for this kind of money
damn let's move on to the last benchmark
now which i think is Ghost Recon
wildlands which is unoptimized at this
point in time but still we'll give it a
run but man I'm just so impressed so far
denoted guys the last benchmark that we
did was the Ghost Recon wildlands we see
there the CPU usage this thing wasn't
even having any troubles and the frame
rates were really good now I did set
this too high
instead of ultra because this game is
just so graphically intensive at the
moment so the fact that it can pull
those frame rates with really good
minimum frames is a really good thing
for horizon so let's move over now to a
conclusion with this setup so there it
is the cheapest motherboard I could get
my hands on for a be 350 and it's
absolutely kicking ass with the cheapest
eight core I could get on the horizon
line that's the r7 1700 and it even came
with the cooler so this whole combo
again just incredible value for money
now I will be doing some more tests but
it looks like those updates especially
starting to flow through for performance
the BIOS update is enabling me to get
the memory up even on this beast 352 to
933 R megahertz on the memory and also
it's handling a 1080 TI
overclocked absolutely fine at 1080p man
this thing is doing so well I can't wait
to bring you guys a build with this
budget set up sort of like cookie cutter
rise and build I've also got my
workstation coming as well so stay tuned
for that because I promised before
Verizon came out I said if the
performance is good I'll be switching my
main rig over to rising and that's
exactly what's going to happen please
stay subscribe and hit the like button
and I'll be coming back to you guys with
another tech video very soon and if
you've got any questions about today's
videos be sure to drop a comma in the
comment section below and I'll get back
to you as soon as I can
he's out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
