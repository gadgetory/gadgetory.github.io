of hard drives and FSH DS with their
Barracuda 5 CUDA and iron wolf series of
drives and today I'm going to put them
to the test and see if they're hitting
the market hard or if they're hitting a
gate welcome back to tech city and this
is the yes-man Brian coming to you guys
today with a look at three different
drives first is the drive that I put in
my personal rig in both a raid 1 and
raid 0 setup these are the new lineup of
Barracuda drives they come in different
size variations going from 500 gigabytes
to 4 terabytes into 7200 rpm drives they
also have a two-year warranty though
there's also the pro lineup however the
boasts an impressive 5 year warranty and
as larger size is available up to 10
terabytes though these are a little bit
more costly however the 3 terabyte
drives that I purchased from you might
came in at around 130
AUD each which would be about 95 USD I
believe they are even cheaper in the US
however coming in at 90 USD flat in raid
0 the performance was very impressive
scoring both over 300 megabytes of read
and writes per second and the
consistency of these read and writes
never had any noticeable dips and this
was across a huge 50 gigabyte random
stress test though what about the boot
times loading games in frame times may
you ask well it took one of these drives
roughly 48 seconds to boot from a cold
boot and comparing that to the sshd
after three runs that scored 41 seconds
and until nvme SSDs I have here in raid
0 they scored a mere 12 seconds gaming
load times were also very similar
scenario where the Barracuda scored
similar to the fire cooter on their
first attempts having load times of
roughly 20 seconds and then that load
times of roughly 21 seconds though the
sshd was extremely impressive on the
second run it loaded up the initial game
in five seconds and the map in almost
the same time as the MVM SSDs at one
second and when testing game frame times
on dota 2 the barracuda and also sshd
scored ever so slightly better than the
Intel ray drives so this is the test
with some parents involved but it does
go to show that these drives will not
hamper your
in any way shape or form the next drive
we have up here is my favorite out of
the bunch this is the fire CUDA 2
terabyte sshd you can get these in both
one or two terabyte flavors and they
also have a 2.5 inch variant available
for laptops so when I was looking at the
price this Drive comes in at roughly a
hundred and fifty ozzie dollars or 103
US dollars in the States and comes with
a five-year warranty five years five
five years five years which is huge for
a drive that features eight gigabytes of
mlc SSD caching portion and also has
7200 rpm of two terabyte storage onboard
this drivers mentioned before performed
really well when loading up games after
the second load
so Seagate claims that this sshd has new
learning algorithms that help with
performance seem to be quite true though
Cole boots was still quite slow even
after the third turn of trying
however performance weight the
Barracudas was really consistent in both
read and writes so this drive just like
the previous gets the nod of approval
and lastly in the line up is their iron
wolf Pro and non Pro variants these are
drives that come in flavors ranging from
one terabyte all the way up to 10
terabytes and now these drugs include a
five-year warranty and a rated for 300
terabytes per year of Rights which is
incredibly large when doing the tests on
these 7200 rpm drugs these drives
performs better even than the barracudas
and scored over 200 megabytes per second
read and writes even in RAID one
configuration across again a 50 gigabyte
random file stress test and the
consistency of these read and writes
were again very good an interesting
point was that the 4k random reading
rates were also quite high for that of a
hard drive which would indicate that
these drives are designed for constant
writes which will not only serve
perfectly as an ass solution but will
also be great for security solutions
where consistent writes are a must over
eight wanna race you also get rotational
vibration sensors onboard which help
eliminate errors from vibration and on
that note the drugs are more shock
resistant to vibrations than other hard
drive I already tested this feature out
in the recent QNAP Nash solution reviews
that I did you can check out this video
up here which I founded the are these
sensors managed to work phenomenally
well the iron wolf pro
also for some weird reason look very
slick and simple I really like the look
at these Drive and lastly with the item
of pro drives you get the ability to
connect up to sixteen drives in a raid
configuration and also with the non pro
version you only get the ability to
connect up to eight drives which is
still plenty there's also only a three
year warranty on the non pro versions of
the drives however if you do get the pro
variants of the drive there's also an
additional two year Seagate data
recovery service included and they have
included their own health management
software too so in conclusion all the
drives I had up here on the test bench
today performed really well the reading
rights were so consistent that I can
recommend pretty much all these drives
for their intended market I think if
you're on a budget the Barracuda offers
really good price performance you can
put all your games on there put your OS
on there and you'll still have a decent
experience in terms of load times if
you've got a little bit more money and
you want a bit more warranty then the
fire CUDA pro would be my personal pick
you get two terabytes and you get it for
a pretty good price and you get a
massive five-year warranty then you've
got the iron wolf pros which are
intended for the prosumer market or the
business segment with offering great
speeds and also very reliable
performance although it does cost a bit
more than the other variants I've
mentioned here today anyway guys if you
enjoyed today's videos and be sure to
hit that like button and let me know in
the comments section below what do you
think of Seagate new lineup of hard
drives I personally am pretty impressed
with them all and I'll catch you guys in
the Nullah tech video very soon peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
