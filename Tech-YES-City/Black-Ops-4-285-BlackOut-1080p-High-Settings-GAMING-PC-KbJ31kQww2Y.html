the Battle Royale edition of this
franchise has finally been released and
as always in the good nature of tacky
air city we're gonna be building a
potato that can play this game or
hopefully play it I don't know yet as we
picked up a Dell Vostro here this has an
i7 870 CPU it's got a gigabytes of RAM
500 gigabyte hard drive and some random
gravis car that we're gonna be ditching
very soon minimum spec requirement state
that you need an i five 2500 K or a
gratis Cod of a gtx 660 or an AMD 7850
or greater so for that problem we're
gonna try and solve it by using an EVGA
6 gigabytes 1060 I'd pick this up on a
bargain for 240 Aussie dollars I think
that's like around about 170 us and also
this PC behind me we've got this for 70
US dollars as well so it's a combination
that looks like it will come in under
250 US dollars except for one thing and
that is nowadays I just can't live
without having an SSD in my system
especially with the price tag of these
things you can pick them up for under 30
US dollars so we'll be adding that into
the build as well and without said we've
got to build total here it's coming in
around at $260 the game itself cost
around 70 US dollars and this power
supply here this is one of the things
I'm worried about so we're going to be a
little bit crazy we're going to try use
the included power supply by using a two
side of the PCIe connector on this thing
and see if we will actually run the ten
sixty and the i7 870
this video is brought to you by
Squarespace and tech yet City viewers
are getting 10% off and this is great
because Squarespace offer a complete
package where you can just build manage
and maintain a website all year round
without crazy overheads and crazy
charges that other companies will charge
you to get off the ground if you're a
small business this service is very
crucial because you can get a
professional-looking website that looks
the part and plays the part for only a
fraction of the cost of what the other
guys can do
so here's the build here it's completed
we did clean this build down in a
previous video that I did I'll put the
link up here if you want to check that
out so it already got some check yes
loving but the cable management itself
was super easy we talked it behind the
hard drive in the SSD since there's two
reasons for this of course we want to
make the build look pretty decent but
there's also no cable management on this
case itself and the cable length runs
that we have on the solder cables here
since we are using two of those for the
gravis cards is very limited so there's
the build right there I do worry about
this power supply since it only does
have 17 amps available on the 12-volt
line so we could run into a problem
ideally with something like an i7 and a
gtx 1060 you'd want this to be around 25
a or greater just to be on the safe side
but never attempted this before so why
not give it a shot
so everything was installed we're ready
to get going but it just switched off I
even got this on camera while going
through the menu so unfortunately the
palace play is not good enough for these
components so we're gonna have to change
that around and then get into black ops
4
so we just finished playing black ops 4
on this PC we won a victory royal with
the i7 870 and the GTX 1016 what I
realized from this combo is that this
game actually needs a lot of graphical
processing power from the graphics card
and so I'll surprised to see that 1066
gigabyte it could really only just
handle this game at 1080p high settings
and the funny thing was the difference
between low settings and high settings
wasn't that much at all we're talking
like around 10 FPS on average so whether
that has to do with the i7 870 or not I
do doubt it I mean this CPU was handling
this game absolutely fine
there was no stuttering at all
whatsoever even on the hundred player
battle royale modes the zombies was
really smooth and also the standard
multiplayer the six versus six that was
really smooth - so I think we stumbled
on a combo that just works really well
for this game if you want to play it at
1080p but if you want to save some money
on a graphics card because the 1060 is a
little bit expensive especially compared
to some of the previous potatoes I've
done and so you'd have to really step
down the resolution to something like
720p but you can drop the settings even
more but I find with this game unlike
pub G and unlike 49 is if you drop the
graphics settings I actually find it
more difficult to see things for me
personally I loved playing this game at
1080p high not only were the graphics
smoother and they looked better but I
could also see enemies clearer and that
helped me get a battle royale victory as
opposed to playing on low settings I had
no clue what was going on at all and the
way every time I came close to winning I
just sometimes just blacked out but
we'll get done with this PC first then
we'll talk about black ops 4 in general
because I think
Treyarch have done an amazing job but
one thing that surprised me with this PC
was that we had an i7 870 and it wasn't
overclocked at all using a stock cooler
a Dell motherboard and also a gigabytes
of RAM that we haven't touched any
settings for so these are out of the box
settings and in the BIOS you can't even
do any tweaking or overclocking so this
meant that we were running kind of a
worst case scenario for the i7 870
it was on a real mediocre palace play
and this still ran the game really
smoothly so they've done a great job in
getting this game optimized from the
get-go and making sure it doesn't
stutter making sure it does play on
something that's kind of semi potato
because the i7 870 that's a CPU now
that's going back quite a few years it's
actually really old now it's the first
gen i7 and we're now moving on to soon
to be knife gens so that's kind of like
eight years in the making and this thing
can still play a latest released
triple-a title but of course the gtx
1060 in this particular game goes hand
in hand with this cpu now if you do want
to get 120 FPS reasons being you want to
step up your competitive game a little
bit more then you will need to get a
better cpu and also a better GPU in my
opinion if for instance you want to play
at 120 FPS at 1080p i do believe this
game is capped at the moment in blackout
modes so I'd like to see them raise the
cap but besides that the game itself
plays really well it's so enjoyable the
things that they've implemented in the
multiplayer the way the gun shoot the
item drops and also the different items
you can use I like it how they've got
trophy systems as well so you can sort
of do different strategies as opposed to
pub G &amp;amp; fortnight they had their own
strategies but I guess pub G was sort of
the most basic of all three of these
games now and of course it just has that
black ops 2 feel which was my favourite
Call of Duty series of all time and it
sort of felt like after that they
dropped the ball there was too many
hackers and then they just made the game
cheap to compensate for that and sort of
didn't have any kind of scene on the PC
but this time around it seems like this
game on PC but also ps4 and Xbox one is
definitely going to be one to get even
though the game itself does have a high
price tag I think that represents that
it's a much better implementation of the
game than the previous Call of Duty
series like advanced warfare and ghosts
and some of those other titles that I
really didn't play a whole lot but this
one I'm definitely going to be getting
into it a lot more a lot more fun very
well optimized and hopefully there will
be less hackers on PC I mean I have come
into already cobbler
times where there's been some suspect
movement but hopefully Activision do a
good job this time around and making
sure hackers don't jump on black ops 4
and ruin it for everyone because the
previous time I was playing the Call of
Duty even just this year there was
people late literally advertising their
websites and just blatantly hacking and
I didn't like that at all just
frustrated me and a lot of other people
just quit and I think that's what did it
for me and a lot of other guys playing
this title on PC but new guys if you
enjoyed today's budget build and be sure
to hit that like button also I did have
to add in a twenty US dollar power
supply this is only a 300 watt power
play the build itself used up to about
250 watts from the wall so the 1060 does
juice a little bit of power especially
this older i7 872 coupled together but
250 watts isn't a problem even most
basic power supply should be able to
handle this something that I've sort of
been delving in with lately is sort of
trying different sorts of power supplies
not your complete bottom-of-the-barrel
but more sort of mid-range power
supplies and sort of just see how many
of them have problems as we saw with
today the included Dell power supply the
17 amp that I cut out after about 30
seconds of being within black ops 4 so I
thought I'd try my luck but I didn't get
lucky in that regards but it would have
been cool if those power supplies were
kind of underrated on the stickers and
they actually had a bit better hardware
that's what I was hoping for but didn't
quite get there anyway guys let me know
in the comment section below what you
think of this PC and also what you think
of black ops 4 I'm really liking it it's
one of those titles that's been sort of
a breath of fresh air for me personally
as a PC player I'm glad to see Treyarch
implant the game really well sort of
bring back a bit of life into the Call
of Duty franchise especially after some
of the recent blunders in my opinion
then they released on PC anyway guys
I'll catch in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye
