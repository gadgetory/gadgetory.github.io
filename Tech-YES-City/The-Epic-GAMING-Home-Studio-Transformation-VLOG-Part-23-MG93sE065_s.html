battle station stuff
okay so today we are going to be
painting these walls and then we are
going to be put in the desks in and also
laying out some carpet as well as
getting all the parts ready to be set up
for part three so let's get on with it
now the paint we're going to use is some
red paint so this background is going to
be red and upstairs that smile to set up
that's a blue background so we're going
to have the blue stage and this is going
to be the red stage so let's get on with
the show
alright so we have finished the first
coat of paint it's still a little bit
wet you probably see on the camera but
we're going to give it one more paint
coat of paint tomorrow and then it's
going to be finished and then we are
going to get the des set up and the
carpet as well I don't know what the
carpet is exactly but there it is over
there there's a carpet so we got that
for about forty dollars so it's about
half this room and so that'll be brown
carpet that'll go on with the wood and
yeah it's going to I can already
envision it it's going to be epic so
stay tuned for more because getting late
I mean I got to let the paint dry so
we're going to let it dry overnight and
then I'm going to get back into it
tomorrow but I think it's looking wicked
already like this red is when like super
win anyway alright so this is the wall
it's still way not dry yet so some parts
aren't dry if we see there the Middle's
not like the bottoms not dry the middle
is kind of dry so still waiting probably
takes another day for it to dry fully
and then we'll give it another coat
Booya alright so we have finished the
second coat now and you can see it's
kind of a little bit inconsistent and
that's because the paint we used was
like a glossy kind of paint and and this
is the thing you should find this out
before you're painting walls so I
actually asked my dad after that is like
yeah you should use some low Sheen paint
on interior walls so anyway it's not to
worry though this is you know we got the
spotlight I've put the spotlight on it
and right now we've got direct light on
it and it's not too bad so it'll do the
job I mean especially when we've got the
camera blurred out in the background it
should be no problems at all but it's
pretty I mean for what it's worth we did
kind of do a reasonably good job I mean
it is kind of consistent so hopefully
it's not hopefully it doesn't look too
bad in camera anyway with that being
said it is time to start setting up all
these deaths here
and we also have some carpet over here
as well so there's some carpet over here
that I am going to start rolling out so
I'm just going to clean up a little bit
first to take out the papers I'm the
trash they've got like this mad red and
black theme you can see here in Japanese
it says red door one set door on that
note I don't know why they're calling it
a work chair I mean like if they just
put gaming chair on this thing that'd be
selling like three times as much got the
carpet ready it's kind of like this fold
out carpet and it's about ain't 30 USD
are about 40 aud down my local hardware
store and that's about 3.6 meters by 2.7
meters are silent so that's the specs
but this is actually like the grade up
so this models like the grade up and you
know you can get bottom of the barrel
stuff for like twenty dollars and that
stuff's nasty I mean I I should know
I've used it in the past you know when
when I was like a thousand subscribers
you know you're on a budget you gotta
make your money work but you know now
that you know I've got a few bit more
subscribers bit more views i can afford
the ten-dollar more expensive carpets so
anyway let's fold this bad boy out ok so
the carpets down now and I've just got
to start putting back all the stuff on
there and we're gonna get the desk set
up now Booya so we've got all the parts
laid out here as you can see it's
there's a lot of work to do still so
this is going to be put part 3 where I'm
going to be setting up all the desks I'm
going to be guest setting up a new rig
down here as well this is going to be my
gaming 4k gaming rig and also we've got
new parts here so you probably
interested in what are these parts I've
got the samsung 850 transferring to
gigabyte SSD and I've got so this is
going to be great because everyone's
always asked me about which is better
the crucial that makes 100 or the
samsung you know they're both sort of
the two main solid value-for-money
performers out there so I'm going to be
putting that against the crew
shull and telling you guys which one I
think is better so stay tuned for that
comparison but also we've got here an
interesting brand it's called Marshall
like I've never even heard of it before
it was like 45 dollars for a one
terabyte drive so it was pretty cheap
for Japan so I'm going to see how that
performs and then below that we've got
an 850 white platinum rated super flower
power supply so people have been telling
me Brian you have to get a power supply
that is from sugah flower because
they're pretty much making the best
power supplies out there at the moment
but doesn't matter I got it so it was
actually pretty good value for money for
a power supplies about one hundred and
forty dollars but in Japan that's
actually pretty good i couldn't find any
power supplies that were sort of better
value for money in terms of features and
what I wanted so yeah that's going to be
going in the new rig and there's the
soft boxes as well so I'm going to be
setting up to New soft boxes these are
about twenty dollars each and it's just
going to save me basically carding that
soft box from downstairs all the time to
upstairs so yeah going to be a
convenience thing this whole setup here
is going to be convenience anyway so
that's it for part two guys if you liked
this video then please give it a thumbs
up and I will catch you guys in part 3
so stay tuned peace out for now way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
