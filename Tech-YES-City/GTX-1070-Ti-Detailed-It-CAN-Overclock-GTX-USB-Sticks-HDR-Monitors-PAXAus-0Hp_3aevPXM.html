conference room now there is huge news
ten seventy TI and I'm joined here by
John how you don't man and so people
want to know what's going on with this
ten seventy TI it's coming in between a
1070 to 1080 obviously but what's it
bringing to the market and what price
point
how many CUDA cause and of course the
biggest question is it overclockable
we've got these rumors out there telling
us it's not overclockable but we're
gonna squash that rumor right now aren't
we
oh yes that's definitely overclockable
it's it's like all the rest of the 10
series it's very nicely overclockable
card there we go guys so you can get
this card you can overclock it just like
any GTX 10 Series card that it's out
there at the moment this card however
has five memory instead of five acts of
gddr5 instead of 5x right yes it does so
you won't be able to hurt you won't have
the same memory bandwidth as you do one
of GTA X 1080 but you can still crank it
up so there we go guys so it's coming
right in between the 1070 and the 1080
in terms of performance but I think it'd
be more closer towards the 1080 when it
comes out as the CUDA cores yeah we've
got one unit disabled this time so
that's around two thousand three hundred
and forty something criticals 2432
okay so that's it's really close to the
1080 actually more closer to 1080 then
the 1070 there's gonna be board partner
cards out there straight away from the
get-go to with this release right not
just the founders god no no they'll
they'll definitely be board partner
cards it'll be on sale on the 3rd of
November ah so nice quick turnaround
from announcing to being on sale and you
can in fact pre-order at bound again
what are we talking about in pricing
terms at the moment the pre-orders are
going for 719 to 749 Australian dollars
US dollars US dollars we're looking at
449 MSRP and now with the cryptocurrency
mining going on this may be indeed a
popular card because of that non X
memory rights got gddr5 which is
actually very faster faster than X in
terms of latency
now cryptocurrency miners they will want
to pick this up probably is there any
way that gamers can only get these cards
rather than the cryptocurrency miners
because I know there'll be a lot of
gamers out there wanting to get their
hands on one of these things as a lot of
the cards are sold out at the moment
what's your thoughts on that
although you know but our main target is
gamers you know and videos all about
giving gamers great experiences yeah
we're doing everything we can to make
sure they end up in gamers hands you
work with our retailers we really focus
down on getting these out to the gamers
so now back to the base reference design
here we've got input and output we've
got one DVI we've got one HDMI and also
three display ports is that going to be
standard across all the cards because I
see these three cards behind me they've
all got the same input outputs it's
ultimately it's up to the partners you
know we we have our preferred
configuration which is that but partners
are you know they have some flexibility
in what outputs they put onto the card
and also what the founders cool it's
just like any other founders card on the
10 series right indeed it's invidious
design of the card it's it's nothing
specifically Bend or chosen yeah it's
it's alcohol on the TB we're looking at
around 30 more watts to than a 1070
right yeah so we're looking at it's a
180 watt card so now you've got your new
1070 TI card right and now this is
destiny too so I'm guessing they time
this card perfectly with the release of
destiny now you've also got a monitor
coming out with the release of the 1070
alright this opponent is actually coming
out in a few months time it's something
we've been working on for a long time
it's our first g-sync HDR monitor we
first showed this off at CES this year
we've shown it a few times since and now
we're really coming up to actual release
so this is the first time we've brought
it down to Australia it is by far the
best PC monitor you'll ever see okay so
we're talking about this before this
interview and now this monitor is made
for that ultimate enjoyable experience
not necessarily the best esports monitor
but it's made for that person who wants
to get just a smooth gorgeous picture
correct yeah this this monitor is very
much about image quality so it's about
HDR there's 384 backlight levels
it's a 4k screen 144 Hertz it just gives
the most gorgeous image that you'll ever
see
I did actually I'm gonna go play around
on this thing I'm looking forward to
having a good experience but the picture
just looks gorgeous from here you got
HDR 144 Hertz is it and also an IPS
panel so this
thing is the ASA model at the moment and
it's going to hit the market what can we
turn talk about in terms of pricing on
this thing
oh we really don't know pricing yet it's
it's going to be a premium product
though okay so expect a relatively
expensive price tag however with that
you're gonna be getting the best
experience on the user end so now on to
the last really cool product here on the
Nvidia conference room is their little
USB sticks though it came out of really
what was initially a joke right yes Oh
April April Fool's this year we will be
announced the GTX assist AI assistant
for gaming and as part of that we had to
make this USB stick now most of the
comments about it was where can I buy a
USB stick where can I get a USB stick
that's awesome so we decided to actually
make them so if you're very lucky you
know you might win a competition there
they're in very restricted supply but
yeah we've actually made this USB stick
it's USB 364 gig it's actually quite a
nice little piece of kit but very hard
to find very hard to get but probably
one of our more exclusive products okay
how much can we expect to pay one more
for one of these things if we buy it
from the Nvidia store you can't oh yeah
but there we go rekt
so anyway John thanks for taking your
time to show us through the Nvidia
conference room here the 1070 TI
obviously being the big news I can't
wait to give you guys some coverage on
that seeing how it performs against the
1070 and also the 1080 and of course the
1080 Ti it's gonna slot where it should
be but it's going to be another great
edition for gamers going into Christmas
and especially with destiny too so I'll
catch you guys in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
