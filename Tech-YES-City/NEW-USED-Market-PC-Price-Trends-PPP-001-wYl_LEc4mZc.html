episode of PC parts and the prices and
the trends that are going on the transit
will be happening and I don't know like
I thought well this is interesting stuff
we're seeing sort of market shift in
different ways some of these things are
happening out there at the moment
and we can take a look at it especially
with the deals hunt that just happened
we can talk about what's going on in the
market also chat hope your crack and
hope your pop and let us know if the
audios good because I have not
livestream in a long time so I do not
know if this is gonna work that well so
do let us know straight away if the if
there are some problems with the
livestream but hopefully this is a thing
that you guys enjoy hopefully is the
thing that we can continue but with that
said let's get into the first topic here
and that is a new parts around we're
gonna talk about use parts but also new
parts in this stream where I'm seeing
some things happening and I'm seeing
some videos out there as well where
they're sort of like contradicting
opinions and that is like we've got
people saying don't build a gaming PC
right now then there's people saying
like scatter vault for example he made a
really good video talking about why it's
a really good time to build a gaming pc
right now I'm gonna sort of be
advocating on that and sort of talking
about the trends which the numbers here
are showing that it is pretty much one
of the best times to be building
yourself a gaming PC ladies and
gentlemen and that's because we'll start
off with DDR I mean ddr3 but we also got
ddr4 Ram prices these are the lowest we
have ever seen these in like literally
like history of ddr4 Ram prices so when
you've got this line like run and
screening out hover the mouse over it
it's the lowest it's ever been so if
you're hanging out for Rison 3000 series
then a smart move would be to even get
all your other components ready and
except the motherboard and the CPUs
because there are some rumors floating
around that some boards might not even
support the new 3000 CPUs so if that's
the if that room is true then yeah you
might need a new motherboard so you
don't want to go out and buy one now if
you
do it in anticipation of the new rising
cities but we see a ddr4 train process
Louis never been absolutely incredible
time to be picking that up especially if
we can contrast it to last year where
men a lot of people didn't want to build
a gaming PC because these prices were
out of control and that was coupled with
the GPUs as well when we had the
cryptocurrency mining boom that was just
like going out of control as well so we
had those two factors and just people
weren't building gaming pcs there was
the rise of used parts tech ES City to
channel here had a massive boost because
of the cryptocurrency mining situation
also the ddr4 Ram process people were
just going to use price performance
wherever you looked you look laughs
gaily damn someone building to use PC
look right so I'm building to use PC
look straight in front of you now
there's someone building a new PC so we
look at some other prices as well CPUs
risin 526 hundred a good thing that I'm
going to talk about with this CPU is
that a lot of things have been happening
here and that is because the word of
Rison itself like AMD had a bad history
with the FX CPUs people will sort of
like new sort of weary to go with a
three build but if we look at a Verizon
five build for example that's easily one
of the most popular builds at the moment
like if I'm flipping a PC at the moment
and I'm talking rising five 2600 C score
in there people kind of know what it is
people want that like people aren't
afraid to take AMD now I haven't had
really any questions of people like
being worried about going with an AMD
CPU so the good word of rise in CPUs and
their value on those CPUs is starting to
get around and so that is influencing
purchasing decisions and that stigma of
not going AMD is sort of starting to go
away at least on the CPU side this is
sort of like real hustle from the
streets guys and that's how I like to do
it with my channel you know out on the
pods Hans people meet up with isn't like
I'm at stake here so you don't like yeah
dude I'm just a normal dude you know
doing the hustle straight to your door
with the with the cash in hand that's
how it works sometimes so we got the
request for Zeon's as well we're gonna
talk about that after rosen 3000 comes
out we're gonna have a lot of zeon
content but in the meantime is it a good
to build a new PC the answer is
definitely yes and another reason we're
gonna go on to this is also Nathan
thanks for the Nathaniel here's a baller
thanks for the donation Brella also
shame you couldn't make the Avengers
tonight so yeah I'm gonna go see The
Avengers later tonight so no spoilers in
the comments this is like one of those
movies where you just don't do spoilers
because like you can spoil Star Wars and
all that stuff because like the tangent
the Star Wars is going on but this
Avengers man who I can't wait for it
just like hanging out for us like what
better to do a livestream before then
your Avengers and we'll go see that but
cheers for the donation brother hope are
you having a good weekend will you're
gonna start to have a good weekend but
back to this new PC price a little bit
new PC prices and we got the lowest the
prices have ever been so risin 526
hundreds are so cheap at the moment
we've got ddr4 SSD prices way we look at
SSD storage lowest it's ever been so 128
gigabytes look at that line the line is
like we zoom in on that look at that
line right there it's the lowest it's
ever been we are at just a amazing time
where all the components are just
suggesting for you to build a new PC now
there's gonna be that argument of oh
wait for the rise in 3000 CPUs because
they're gonna they could be so much
better they could be but the thing is if
you're just a game are looking to get
into PC gaming even if the rise in 3000
CPUs are so much better then how's that
gonna lift your GPU performance like
your graphics cards still gonna be the
part that is going to be given you a
good gaming experience and if you're on
a mid-range graphics card like say for
instance you go for an RX 570 or you go
for an RTI X 2060 if you've got a bit
more budget
Rison 520 600 currently handles those
grabs cuts absolutely fine and I mean by
the time you're ready to upgrade this
gear it's kind of like like yeah are you
gonna be like oh I'm gonna save for
three more years I'm just gonna build a
PC now build a PC now enjoy it and
there's lots of these arguments going
around where people are like oh just
wait just wait and so like me as a pure
me as a PC gamer man I always wanted to
play the games now
and I remember the one time I had I did
the whole white thing you know like you
buy a PC and you sort of wait with
components for the other PC components
to come out before the GTX 670 came out
right here's a real story I sold all my
PC before that and anticipation of the
gtx $600 but those two weeks that i had
to play on intel HD graphics man that
was torture like I just man my hair was
falling out because like I tried to play
World of Warcraft and I was getting like
12 FPS on the absolute lowest settings
and I remember that stage I was like
yeah man this graphics card better come
out soon I mean maybe it was a good
thing because I finally went outside a
little bit more than I was used to going
outside but yeah there's the story there
about waiting for PC you know components
around the corner now on top of that
we're gonna talk about the Navi series
as well because that's a big thing going
around people like wait for the rising
3,000 CPUs wait for the Radeon the new
Navi GPUs and it's like man you cannot I
want to tell you guys you're not gonna
get a better deal like Navi is not gonna
beat $86 like I'm in Australia so the
shipping costs are gonna be like through
the roof because it is on ebay.com
but you're not gonna get a better deal
then um sorry guys a Jody ball with
enjoy hand game with a chop-chop man how
did you know I love Choctaw sorry I just
gotta stop this dude Chuck tops are so
good man I'm definitely getting one
thanks I might like thanks for the
donation brother I'm gonna get two of
them now this is I just love Choctaw bye
screams but going back to here with the
rx 570 we've got $86 you asked for one
of these cars shorts used the hounds
Navi gonna beat that in price
performance it ain't gonna beat it in
price performance and another thing is
when we look at 1080p gaming I mean do
you need to game on ultra settings I
mean this card will do 1080p medium and
high settings of practically every game
out there it is a really good price
performance card I remember when I
started picking these things up in
droves from minors I was just like wow
this is such good
value-for-money now we just finished
doing the giveaway for the it's actually
for kids and I gave one of the PCs to
the school we just finished that and it
was so good like they all got our x5
70's all got 4th gen Intel's RGB bling
so stay tuned for that video that's
coming but um I also got a request to
show you my thumb it's actually coming
along really nicely so there's my thumb
there and it's like the scars actually
healing slowly but it'd be a couple of
years before it's like absolutely a
hundred percent PC for one night says
house I've been I've been really good
things have been going really good
around tag guest City don't worry about
that I was like how can we make things
better do a livestream for you guys when
we talk about PC price trends as well so
you know the rs5 70s at the moment is
easily the hottest card in the use
market as well as what looks like the
new market we go over to here 130
dollars new now the gtx 1650 just came
out and this is the crazy thing about it
because people are talking about all gtx
16 fifties terrible value for money it's
look when i'm gonna say it's a
disappointment in that with you look at
the 1050 TI - the 750 Ti that came out
with double the vram and you had a big
chunk extra performance for that no 6
pin requirement the 1650 it doesn't
deliver much over the 1050 Ti that's my
biggest thing without even looking at it
yet I've got one here but I just know
like honestly I just haven't even been
bothered to test it yet
galux are sending over another one too
so I was like you know 1650 is probably
only worth one video at best so I was
like yeah I'll just make one video and
that's it for that I kind of don't want
to make any videos more videos on it
because it doesn't look like it's good
price performance at all and we're gonna
talk about that om situation because
yeah you know there's the argument of ok
you can whack a 1650 in an OEM and it's
gonna be glorious it's gonna be magical
times and it's like I think the meta is
shifting away from that where if you get
a om most likely you're gonna just gut
the thing and take all the goodness out
of it and put it in a nice new case with
a decent power supply so there's a lot
of like the metas are shifting away from
that and even then you could face the
problem
of the 1650 not even being supported on
that particular motherboard I've got to
talk to bit where but I mean he did a
video I recently looked at his video is
really good but he was really lucky that
there was a BIOS update that actually
worked to allow his 1650 to work because
I've seen boards I've seen so many
boards in the past with OEMs they just
don't boot with proper graphics cards
and after that you just stuck with a
board that's essentially a dud you can
use it with like a GTX 580 because
that'll support like legacy and all that
secure boot options and suffer but the
thing is there's no CSM options in the
bias there's no secure boot so those
boards are essentially useless but
getting back to here we've got here
right here brand new RX 5 seventies 130
bucks I mean brand-new 1650 150 bucks if
you just look at a price performance
this one's a no-brainer
the 1066 gigabytes 1050 T is use market
there's still a good pickup I mean in my
last previous parts hunt I mean I pro
put the link in the description off the
live streams over I picked up one for
like a hundred Aussie dollars tempered
ETI it's an adduced model really good
it's like 70 USD so that's a really good
buy 1066 gigabyte I go on for 180 Aussie
which is like hundred twenty-six USD
really good buy - I do like the 1066
gigabyte still a pretty hard card
especially we can get a good for a good
price some of these prices here on eBay
obviously there's a Buy It Now prices if
you couldn't be bothered 160 bucks a
little bit too steep I mean you'd like
to see that round about 140 and then
that'd be a decent pickup but looking at
the 1650 man you can write that thing
off especially when the 1660 which
offers so much more performance is only
another like 50 $60 you want to be
getting that because that is actually a
decent card so in terms of the in terms
of our poor little friend here he ain't
looking so good in terms of price
performance but also when our AMD's
actually going really hard on the RX 570
so there's this other argument we're
gonna go into the price trends right
because people are like in astray if
you're in Australia I've noticed one
thing as well we talked about our TX 20
70s and 20 60 days I've gone up slightly
in price
I was picking these up for around a
hundred I think it was like a hundred
seven hundred dollars you dollars now
even on eBay sales you're getting him a
bit cheaper oh man this sites so bad
apparently they're redoing it
um close that down but okay RTX 20 70s
they're gone for about 700 retail now
they're up to about 720 so I that time
when I made that eBay video was a really
good time to buy new parts especially
those higher-end parts I mean we had our
TX 20 80s going in ours for like eight
hundred sixty dollars I picked one of
them up such a good buy at those prices
but in terms of innovation and there's
this argument before we move on with
prices and trends and stuff like that
right especially with graphics cards
video cards will go over here to video
cards analyze this for you guys there's
this trend with you know in video
releasing our TX 2070 2060s and all this
and like hey they're stagnated and
there's people who say look AMD is not
providing enough competition in the
graphs card market look at what they did
in the CPU market intel responded very
valid argument but there's also the
argument of if AMD doesn't provide the
competition then people are going to go
away and like Nvidia is gonna grab the
ball and just run with it and say hey we
can charge whatever we want and that's
like that argument would be valid if
good old friends at Intel were coming
into the GPU market that's what I've
said in the past whenever there's too
much of an opportunity to make money
you're gonna see a bigger fish come in
to the Forte and that's exactly what
Intel is doing next year obviously
they've weighed up that cost analysis
and they're like hey great time to get
into graphics cards and that's what's
gonna happen next year now one thing
that does worry me about this whole
seeing right and we see like guys like
ad or TV doing some analysis man they're
going hard on it but one thing they
don't talk about is that they're doing
like a lot of its technical analysis now
technical analysis shouldn't be a
predictor of future performance and so
we're seeing with graphics cards in the
past when we look at the 9 Series to the
10 series massive jump but now we've
seen the 10 series to the the 20 series
and there isn't that massive jump so
like you can see already that the
falsies I should you've waited to buy a
20 series guard if you got a 10 series
card the answer is no if you got a 10
series guard you're on top of the world
even to this date you got some good
value there even if you bought it new
off the shelves so what I'm we're really
worried about with the GPU market is
stagnation just like the CPU market
where we saw that a Sandy Bridge came
out and then ever since Sandy Bridge it
was just like whoa what
going on here we didn't get a whole lot
of innovation and now we're sort of
seeing more cause and more threads but
we've really come to a brick wall
when it comes to IPC and also single
core performance which are still so damn
important to this day so that's a sort
of like the trends going on now now news
market news market we got to talk about
the use markers there's some people who
are emailing me and they're like Brian
man I can't sell my gaming PC and this
is from guys from Scotland UK I've got
guys in the US so I am seeing some
trends there's a lot more people trying
to sell use pcs get into the hustle it's
funny because a lot of these pcs we're
creating a new market in itself right
it's a growing market but at the same
time there's more competition I'd say
exponentially more competition coming in
then there are buyers so there's more
sellers than there are buyers and that's
growing and growing right and so a lot
of these PCs are coming in and that
would otherwise honestly just go into
the tip and get melted down for
materials or that'd be off the market
they're now coming back into the market
via a gaming PC so you've got this big
flood of competition now where I'm from
especially this is the pinnacle of the
world southeast Queensland this place
we've got to address this because those
guys just spamming gaming pcs left right
and centre you don't get gum tree type
in gaming PC boom man you're gone
actually we might as well do it actually
now we'll leave it off because I don't
want to show any personal details and
stuff like that get on Facebook gaming
PC's same thing boom spam absolute flood
so if you can't sell your gaming PC's
and you've done the whole checklist
you've gone through the whole checklist
of yep good photos good description
you're offering a warranty whether it
even if it's three months you you've got
everything looking schmick and you can't
sell it still that's because it's just
it's a it's generally it's a tough
market now man there's a lot of
competition out there but also at the
same time there's arm I think this is
like going into economics a little bit
guys with trans a but since this is the
episode of trends we'll talk about it I
believe we're starting to go into a
global recession and that could that's a
scary thing so who knows anyway that's
it from this episode guys if you are
enjoying this we can go more in depth
this is all gonna come from you guys the
topics I love talking about this stuff I
love talking about the market building
pcs everything involved you prices new
trends sort of we want to kind of be the
trendsetters here you guys in the
audience have great minds you always
telling me some of these dealers I've
got some really good matters coming I'm
just waiting on it to come in from
Aliexpress there's a really good bill
coming in and I can't wait to give you
guys that it's gonna be special but
waiting on men some of these all the
expressed sellers dude like it's not
Aliexpress actually eBay sells too I've
ordered these as connectors right and if
it was meant to be like male to female
audio converters and they're sending me
the opposite ones four times in a row so
I've got like 40 of these connectors
that are useless and I don't need them
and it's like eBay is like oh yeah I do
refund it I'm thinking yeah I'll do a
refund the whole amount I don't need
this crap cuz it's not what I ordered
anyway that's all so we got anyway we're
gonna address the comments this the
biggest one I see is like Peter Jordan
and his go on YouTube reviewers a bias
because of all the free cards they get
yeah man you obviously haven't been
watching this channel long enough dude I
mean take a look at MSI's laptop that
came through I did a review as good
friends with you love the msi rap do you
think that was a good review for them no
i reviewed that thing through and
through you know why my viewers the core
audience who don't just stick around
right crappy comments like yours
actually stick around for a long time
and know that i don't put bias or any of
that crap in the word review and a lot
of other techtube is out there are the
same man we don't really care about
spinning bias we care about our viewers
and our loyalty and we care about doing
the right thing so yeah you can spin
that crap in the comment section there
mr. jordan but that ain't gonna go down
well not around tokyo city anyway any
other questions guys you want to address
then we shall address them because I'm
gearing up for we're gonna have an epic
feed very soon and then go see the
Avengers and game man I can't wait so
I'm MSA man something I can't comment on
that burro so is a try okay so we're
gonna get a live we gotta go to the
comments now just answer a few comments
then I'm gonna scoot on out of here I'm
gonna put my sponsored corset hoodie on
and
yeah jump on out of here it's actually
funny speaking of the corset right the
h15 I RGB platinum there's an example
right of a review that I got that
product in and people like oh man you're
chill and no I just love the H 115 i RGB
platinum cooler and it's funny because
all the people have bought it I even had
one guy in the comments on that videos
like man I bought this thing it was just
blown away by it and it's like yeah
that's my initial reaction to it was a
really good cooler sure it's expensive
and I said that in the video but that's
how it goes man that's how reviews go so
what happened to my thumb as well I was
working on a Alienware PC case and I you
know like I see things around here man
this is the problem with tech yes City
sometimes I'm always looking for the
most efficient way to do things like
yesterday from 1 p.m. we did banged out
5 pcs so quickly there's for the
giveaway but I just worked so quickly
man I got my automatic screwdriver I've
got my all these tools that just save
time now and the efficiencies just
through the roof but the problem is when
the efficiencies through the roof you
sometimes have a slip-up and yeah I cut
my finger on this PCIe bracket when I
should have used a pair of pliers I'll
just like yeah I rip it out but I
obviously applied too much strength and
yeah man that was the worst I've ever
had it like that's out of building pcs
that's easily the worst accident I've
ever done it could have been a lot worse
man so that's you know sometimes that's
how it goes I'm just grateful I still
got my thumb so the screwdriver itself
will do a shameless plug for Bunnings
since I do love this screwdriver it's
the O's ito but I've got a custom
extended head on it so I just bought
that for 5 bucks and it's saving so much
time that and the data vac man they're
they're just like two tools that I
couldn't live without now because they
save so much time as well as the
chemicals we've got you know the
multi-purpose spray the brake cleaner
brake clean is not getting used as much
as I'd like to but alcohol wipes I just
through the roof good as well man I'm
out actually out of alcohol wipes and I
got to go buy some more like a few few
bottles of mint so you know go do some
alcohol wipes they're super important as
well so maybe if you guys want to see an
updated tech yes cleanse list I can do
that for you guys make that happen
sure thing and you know just the
cleanliness
you know cleanliness is a godliness so
you gotta be hygienic man you gotta take
care of those use pcs as well they've
got feelings
so they got feelings if you don't take
care of them they're gonna they're gonna
haunt you so anyway chat any other juicy
questions anything you really need
answered and I'll get out out of here
another five minutes of chat then I'm
gonna scoot so do you think it'd be
worth putting a rise in 3000 CPUs and be
350 motherboard concern that I won't get
full performance out the chip we don't
know man I don't know like I'm sure it
will be a good thing like I'm sure
dropping around in 3006 core whatever
that'll be a good combination since they
are gonna go down to 7 nanometre gonna
be way more power efficient so that will
be obviously a better thing on the
motherboard mother wall it's got less
stress but how high they clock
everyone's waiting for these details man
I'm gonna be at Computex on that
showroom floor telling you guys the
deets day one so but we can't see some
trends with it and the trends are like
we look at rise in 2000 rise in 1000 we
look at CPUs like Intel CPUs with the
99th gen series we can see with the
overclockable chips chips that are
overclockable are already reaching their
sort of maximum peak in terms of what
they can do on air and water
now you can't extract a whole lot more
performance that's what I'm finding like
9900 K out of the box goes to 4.7
gigahertz but you'll be lucky to get
them above 5 gigahertz same with the
rise and I the was at 2700 X right you
get them they go up to I think I like
the 4 gigahertz out-of-the-box getting
in past 4.2 is pretty difficult so you
can see that those margins are coming
down but if we look at an old-school i7
920 I saw like that man those things
overclocked like 50 percent so see some
trends coming in what you see from AMD
at Computex it's gonna be current at
close to what you can edge out on these
chips that's just my feeling so I'm
looking forward to those announcements
more than anything so well quickly
answer some more questions for you guys
do you use wd-40 on my hair man that's
that's actually a good idea I'm gonna
try that out and I'll maybe post up a
quick vid on Instagram or something like
that try out some wd-40 on the hair if
it's good enough I'll even put it in the
videos so we'll get on some other
questions so those $1 LED strips
sell on my pcs left and right
actly man I'm like you know this is the
thing right some of these tips that I
give you guys on the channel man it's
all real I got nothing to hide you know
if I can't make any more money out of
this gig bro move on to something else
like not afraid to do line marking I've
got a mate who does that I got people
who take care of this man it's a good
world you know just spread the good
vibes keep on hustling keep doing what
you're doing best so this is what it's
all about this channel I want to keep it
more community orientated especially
since I go back from the USA I was like
damn you know like I need to focus on
you know everyone's just talking about
then no one talks about the new stuff to
me everyone talks about the use
price-performance how they're building
pcs and I'm like yeah that's where the
channels got to go more of a focus than
any than ever before sure we'll look at
some new parts but the new parts are
gonna exist to compare about how good
the use market should be and where the
use market should be at so we always
they balance each other out though I'm
just the I'm just the what would you
call it the I like to be the guy on the
the dark side or the light side what
would you call the use side because I
think this is sort of like this is
factions you know I think we're on the
youth side here so yeah molex connectors
on the LED strips the good thing at like
be surprised like people hate molex but
like molex connections are really good
so yeah they're just easy to build like
on cheap builds right so you just put
your LED strip down plug it in a molex
you don't have to do anything else for
cable management anything like it saves
a lot of time so that's why I kind of
like it Sode is even better but anyway
I'm gonna scoot on out of here guys if
you've got more questions as well just
be sure to drop a comment after the live
stream goes like video archive mode and
I'll get back to you guys in the
comments so lots of cool questions
thanks for joining in on this live
stream guys let us know if you enjoy it
and we'll keep it going once a month
just after the parts hunt because one
thing I've realized with the parts
aren't once a month you guys are loving
that I think it's a good balance I kind
of wanted a live stream as well just to
connect with you guys a little bit more
get back on the live streaming as I
haven't live stream for so long it's
been
ancient and people like every time I get
a co-host they either just you know they
do a ghostie on us or arm or they
they're too busy or one week it's not
consistent enough so I'm layer I would
a livestream once a month where I just
do you know do it myself and that way
it's gonna be consistent so who knows
anyway love each and every one of you
guys if you enjoyed this one be sure to
tap that like button and no spoilers no
endgame spoilers I'm gonna go see it
soon and I'll catch you guys later
thanks for tuning in this is the PC
parts prices Triple P purchasing parody
price okay that's like kind of what I
wanted to get at you know the
international thing and this is what its
gonna kind of resemble but for PC parts
alright guys catch up in the next one
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
