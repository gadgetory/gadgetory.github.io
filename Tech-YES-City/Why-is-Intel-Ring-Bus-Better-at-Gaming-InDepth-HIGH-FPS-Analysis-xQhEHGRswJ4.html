especially for gaming has been debated
and argued so much that I realized that
I needed to do something and go to
another level
I needed to bust out the 1000 FPS camera
and also my hacked up Mouse which I made
a tutorial for and I put an LED light on
it and this enables me to get more
information that we've otherwise not had
out in the same because I really wanted
to answer the question of why does Intel
perform better in games then the AMD
rise in CPUs and I noticed a weird
phenomenon too and that was when I
tested the i5 8400 and compared it
against the rise in 720 600 X and I
overclocked that Rison system to 4.1
gigahertz and it was still losing to the
i5 8400 at 3 point 8 gigahertz and this
was a little bit confusing because
especially in the Cinebench score you
had a higher single-threaded score on
the Rison system so not everything
relates to a Cinebench score that's the
first thing I realized but also today
we're going to be taking a look at the
top dogs from both sides the i7 8700 K
which is hailed as the king of gaming
and we're going to compare that against
the horizon 7 2700 X at 4.2 gigahertz
and we're using the same motherboard
from the same company gigabyte we're
also using the same memory exact same
memory with the exact same XMP profiles
on both systems as well as the same
power supply and the same SSD which was
reformatted in the same gtx 980ti so
let's find out what we discover here
welcome back to take your city in the
first game we're gonna pull up for you
guys is see us going in this result
we've got the best frame possible on the
8700 K for all the testing here - that
was nine milliseconds worst frame was 21
milliseconds average over ten runs was
fifteen point four milliseconds moving
over to the AMD side of things we had
ten to twenty four milliseconds so only
slightly better on the intel side it's a
on average roughly a one millisecond
gain from both these CPUs when we look
at the FPS numbers they do show a big
difference between the Intel system and
the AMD system so you are scoring quite
a significant advantage and this was the
most responsive game out of all the
games I tested here today and you're
gonna see a bit of a correlation
happening as we move over to the next
game and that is ashes of the
singularity best frame here was 33
milliseconds worst frame was 42
milliseconds averaged out at 37.3 move
over to the Intel side of things
31 milliseconds best frame worst frame
was actually 43 and that averaged out at
36 milliseconds so we did see an
advantage of 1.3 million seconds on
average and what we're seeing here with
the FPS on this game was the Intel was
beating the AMD system by a little bit
when we look over that risin 5 system
versus the i5 8400 this was where the
risin 5 did score a victory but
ironically enough this was the slowest
game out of all the games I tested here
today in other words the engine wasn't
as responsive so you do an action the
output of it is going to be delayed
compared to competitive multiplayer
titles like csgo for example but moving
over to the next game we had here dota 2
a very popular mobile here on the Intel
side we had the best-case scenario being
17 milliseconds
worst case scenario being 31 this
averaged out at 27 point 4 milliseconds
and then we look at the AMD side we got
21 to 30 3 milliseconds averaging out at
29 the FPS in this game also did favor
the Intel and we look at the difference
in fps it wasn't a huge difference but
again with dota 2 it wasn't as
responsive as csgo or even some of the
other titles that I'm going to be
pulling up for you guys I move over to
GTA 5 we saw the 8700 K have a best-case
scenario of 15 milliseconds worst case
was 25 milliseconds
this averaged out to 21.2 milliseconds
moving over to the AMD side of things
this had a best case in our of 16
milliseconds worst case an hour of 27
averaging out to twenty-three point
three milliseconds when we look at the
FPS difference it does again favor the
8700 K when we do lower the graphical
settings to specifically stress the CPU
to give you guys the data that you want
to know but interesting enough sometimes
the FPS and GTA v is too high that
apparently according to the game
developers can break the engine and what
this does with the point one percent low
is that's your anomaly frames makes them
lower than CPUs that aren't scoring as
high an average fps next up here we've
got overwatch a very competitive
multiplayer online FPS from Blizzard now
Blizzard are very well known for
optimizing their titles especially for
PC Rison does score very well here
getting 279 average FPS versus the Intel
CPU which is closing in at 300 FPS it is
worth noting however this game does have
a 300 FPS cap when we look at the
millisecond times here the best-case
scenario for the 2700 X was 17
milliseconds West case was 34 and we
scored an average of 24 point H move
over the Intel side of things we got a
best-case in RF 15 and a worst-case of
31 and the average was twenty one point
nine milliseconds and with this game in
particular we'll just I guess never know
how much extra FPS the 8,700 cake could
have got though not to worry I did
decide to throw in one more curveball to
all this testing because I wanted to
know how far cry 5 ran which is in the
past Far Cry primal has shown
heavily skewed results - especially the
ring buss CPU not exactly Intel CPUs
because the mesh architecture I 9 for
example doesn't do anywhere near as well
as the 8700 K and this game did again
skew the results heavily to Intel we
sawed 180 average FPS with a minimum of
150 versus a hundred and 38 with the
minimum of the 114 now when it came to
the results this was quite a responsive
game however the average milliseconds
here was twenty eight point one on the
AMD side versus twenty four point nine
on the Intel site so that FPS difference
was making it
difference in terms of the actual input
lag itself with the worst frame remained
e-beam 20 milliseconds best frame being
34 milliseconds then on the intel side
it was 17 milliseconds than the worst
case in our have been 27 milliseconds so
now of course you're probably sitting on
your chair and wondering what does all
this data mean Brian well I'm gonna try
my best to explain it I couldn't find a
heavy correlation between the games
responsiveness and how well a CPU
performs in that particular game though
the data did suggest slightly that the
more lag year a game is the better an
AMD CPU will perform in relation to an
Intel CPU though the more responsive a
game engine is in general the better an
Intel ring bus CPU will perform and I
put an emphasis on ring bus that's like
the eighth generation 8700 K 80 480 100
for example they are the ring bus
architecture the i-9s for example of the
mesh architecture and what we got here
at the 8700 k is something that is so
snappy yet still has six cores and
twelve threads now on average we are
seeing the numbers showing that it does
perform better and not just FPS but also
the total input lag itself so if you're
a competitive gamer of course 1 or 2
milliseconds probably isn't going to
matter a whole lot
but if you add that up over all your
gear if it's 2 milliseconds here 2
milliseconds there 2 milliseconds
everywhere it'll probably make a
difference in tournaments especially so
it's just one of those extra things to
think about if you are a competitive
gamer you do want to get the at most
highest fps possible but you don't want
to be doing it to the extent where
you're wasting too much time I guess
that's where guys like me come in who
love doing these tests love the hardware
and seeing what it's all about
so if I had to make a recommendation it
would be that both CPUs I fidget here
are absolutely fine for gaming however
one does have an edge over the other and
it's because of its architecture not
just its IPC when we look at the
Cinebench scores for example there's
actually a bit more to it and in that
the latency zhan the CPUs themselves are
so important and the faster CPU out at
the moment is the 8700
okay and that's what my results have
showed here today and this is why it's
the gaming King because when a program
or a game for example that requires
lower latencies takes advantage of a CPU
like an 8700 K and it's going to perform
better in games and I'd say arguably a
competitive gamer is the person who
needs that higher FPS as opposed to
someone who's just casually playing on a
1080p monitor they're not really going
to notice the difference they're not
where they're gonna care but if you are
that competitive Pro and you are playing
for money then it might be worth their
time re watching this video anyway guys
I hope you enjoyed this one if you did
then be sure to hit that like button and
let me know in the comment section below
if you have any questions I'm probably
sure you have a lot of questions I'm
just new to this testing I find it
fascinating I'm gonna be testing many
more things because imagine if you've
got a 1 to 2 millisecond difference in
games when it comes to things like Adobe
Premiere Pro for example if you're
editing a video and you're saving 2
milliseconds on every single action you
do you're doing 60 actions per minute
for example that's going to amount to
time saved over the course of you
editing your video and that's one thing
we don't do as bench markers when we do
those numbers the final render times we
don't take into account the actual live
action and the time you could save there
so maybe things weren't just all in my
head in the past when I said the 8700 K
or the Intel CPUs felt snappy Oh anyway
guys hope you enjoyed this one I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
