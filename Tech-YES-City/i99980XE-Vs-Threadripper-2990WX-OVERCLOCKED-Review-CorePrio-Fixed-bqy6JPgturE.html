flagship CPUs from both team red and
team blue starting off with the 2990 WX
a 32 core 64 threaded beast and this is
coming in two currently 2643 Aussie
dollars if you're in America at 1729 US
dollars then beside that is the 79 80 XE
which was released in quarter three of
2017 and since then has had a refresh
which is the 99 80 XE and that's
currently coming in around two thousand
nine hundred and seventy nine dollars if
you're in Australia or in the US around
about two thousand USD flat so these
prices these CPUs are definitely a very
big consideration if you're getting into
the market and today we're gonna go over
a lot of different benchmarks for you
guys with stock figures both out of the
box and overclocked as well which is
very important because me personally in
my workstations I overclocked my
machines they're completely stable I
haven't had one crash out of my 8 core
in the background there but before we do
get on with the benchmarking I was
actually curious about the differences
between these two 18 core parts what has
changed in this refresh and I was
actually quite surprised to see that
Intel we're using stim on this so that's
the soldiering between the diet and the
IHS and I'll show you guys some quick
temperature tests here where the stim
version the 99 ad XE performed a lot
better in terms of temperatures it
allowed overclocking to be smooth with
of course out d letting the cpu which on
a purchase this big I would seriously
consider not D living it because you
will void the warranty and on a CPU like
this the last thing you need to do is
lose that massive investment but besides
the temperatures we've also apparently
gone from 14 nanometer plus to 14
nanometer plus plus where they've
changed the transistor gate pitch from
70 nanometer to 84 which allows for
easier overclocking and more stability
at those higher clock speeds and
speaking of these CPUs and / clocks I'm
clocking the 18 core variants both to
4.4 gigahertz each and then we're
overclocking the 2990 WX 23.8
I did try to get more out of the twenty
nine nine WX but the board just switched
off because it was just drawing too much
power
after those levels and for the memory
we're using the corsair dominator
RGB platinum across all these three
different CPUs so we're gonna give them
apples to apples to apples comparison
and with all that said let's roll those
benchmarks for you guys and then come
back and look at everything in between
with these three flagships
and so there's the benchmarks finished
I'm gonna break this down section by
section and the first thing we'll get
out of the way with is the gaming
benchmarks because they're not that
important for me personally and if
you're in the market for a CPU of this
caliber and this price I believe gaming
shouldn't be your top priority as you
can get cheaper options from both team
blue and team red it'll perform much
better in games that also save you a lot
more money if you wish to see those
reviews up with the 9900 Kay review up
here and also the 2700 X review but with
that other way csgo 1080p high settings
out of the box $2.99 ATX II did perform
a little bit better than the 79 80 X II
which then perform better than the 2990
WX however it is important to know that
twenty nine ninety WX has gotten a lot
smoother
since when it was first released and I
did notice this when I first tested out
the twenty nine ninety WX was a little
bit of a mess but since then windows
have updated their scheduler and it is
performing a lot smoother in games next
up here we had Tom Clancy's Rainbow six
siege another online competitive
multiplayer title where arguably getting
the most FPS possible is pretty
important especially if you are in
competitive play and here is where the
18 core variants perform pretty much
identical even out of the box which I
was quite surprised where the 99 80 XE
is meant to have a 200 megahertz higher
base clock than the 79 80 XE but in this
benchmark they did perform a very
similar and then they both beat out the
2990 W X again but just like I said in
csgo 2990 W X is still a very smooth
experience now as for a streaming
benchmark all three of these CPUs are
geared up towards streaming since they
do have a lot of headroom a lot of
wiggle room and so here's the streaming
benchmarks here but we can see a similar
trend although you are just dropping off
a bit of FPS on all three CPUs anyway
gaming aside let's get on to
productivity benchmarks first up we had
encoding with handbrake and out of the
box the 79 80 XE and the 99 80 XE
perform very similar and Rison thread
Ripper was the twenty nine ninety WX a
little bit memory bound here I believe
scoring these same scores out of the box
versus the overclocked settings and so
this was a little bit disappointing to
see but of course that quad channel
memory mix with 32 cores does have
limitations in some benchmarks but
moving on to 7-zip the compression and
decompression numbers the compression
numbers were in favor of the 18 core
variants and then moving on to the 32
covariant this is a bit of an art kilise
hill on the compression side but the
decompression side was very impressive
scoring over 190,000 points both out of
the box settings and overclock so again
we are still reaching a memory
bottleneck there on the 2990 WX as
opposed to the Intel CPUs which did a
lot better on the decompression side
wants to be overclocked moving on to the
Geekbench multi did confirm something
about the 79 80 X E and the azuz deluxe
2x 299 motherboard and this is a
refreshed x2 99 motherboard and that was
that it was favoring the 79 80 X e out
of the box giving it some enhancements
via a BIOS tweaks but you'll see that
won't relate to all these benchmark
scores here a little bit later but it
was beating out the 99 ATX er to the box
but when we overclocked it we got very
similar scores at 4.4 gigahertz vs. 4.4
gigahertz the Rison chip did very well
out of the box on the single thread
score with these stock settings where it
boosts up to over 4.2 gigahertz
on the single core speeds and then the
3.8 gigahertz coming well behind that
score and then the multi-core score of
doing pretty much the same with again a
memory bottleneck being realized with
3.8 gigahertz versus the old core speeds
out of the box of around 3.15 gigahertz
on the 2990 WX however the next
benchmark Korona 1.3 really showed
whether 2990 WX flexes its muscles and
this is going to be a very important
benchmark as well as a few others in
relation to the conclusion with these
two CPUs but here we've got 37 seconds
versus the best score of 44 seconds on
the both 18 cores at 4.4 gigahertz and
the 99 80 X II was performing better
than the 79 80 XE out of the box in this
particular benchmark moving out of
speedometer we saw some results in favor
of the Intel CPUs where higher is better
in this particular benchmark it's
essentially a web browser benchmark
based off Java and we got a score of 70
7.1 at 4.4 gigahertz and about 76
eight so they're roughly performing the
same the 18 core variants and then the
twenty nine ninety WX was falling a
little bit behind Adobe Premiere Pro
however is another area where the Intel
chips do very strong they do have that
optimization especially for knife gen
architecture and here on eleven minute
and forty-five second is the recent
spell break video I did which is very up
to date has a lot of transitions and
effects we can see here that the
thirteen minute and 55 seconds score out
of the box was pretty much replicated on
both the eighteen cause with it out of
the box settings and then when we
overclocked it we got pretty much the
same settings yet again which did beat
these Red River chips since all those
eighteen calls are being utilized as
efficiently as possible
we didn't see much of a difference
between all these chips when now out of
the box and overclocked in those scores
per se but one thing I will add to Adobe
Premiere Pro especially these benchmarks
is that for me personally it's very
important when I'm scrubbing through
footage that I have the smoothest
experience possible and here's where the
18 chord did Excel especially when it
was overclocked it was just running
through 4k footage even at full render
on live scrubbing absolutely no problems
at all the 2990 WX did struggle a little
bit here and it was noticeable compared
to the Intel counterpart moving to
Cinebench this is where the 32 core
variant really comes out on top those
out of the box and overclocked it could
really spread its wings getting a max
score of five thousand seven hundred and
eighty and then the Intel variant still
did pretty well when they were
overclocked getting around four thousand
two hundred and seventy points the
single core scores were better on the
Intel's both overclocked and out of the
box getting about four point one
gigahertz with stock factory settings
and then that four point four gigahertz
really coming out ahead the resin thread
ribbon chip with its single called boost
at stock settings did go to around four
to four point one seven five gigahertz
which then did beat out these three
point eight gigahertz manual overclock
but now to another simulated 3d
rendering benchmark this is v-ray where
the twenty nine ninety WS did come out
on top
where lower is better in this particular
case with twenty three seconds and then
twenty eight seconds out of the box the
intial eighteen cause when they
overclocked got twenty nine seconds and
then 37 and 39 seconds respectively
so those as OOOs
like two enhancements what working on
the 79 80 XE in this particular
benchmark but the GPUs scores were
pretty much all similar across the board
the ever clock scores getting slightly
better numbers in this particular
scenario and then on to the last
particular benchmark here 3dmark time
spy extreme where we're looking in
particular to the CPU physics scores
where the best scores were done by the
1980 XP at four point four gigahertz
manual overclock and the 79 80 X 80
coming slightly behind we'll talk about
this very soon and why this is and the
thread river chips still doing very well
but that was better when it was out of
the box versus when it was overclocked
so again perhaps that quad-channel
memory limitation on 32 cores is coming
into effect in this particular benchmark
anyway guys pulling up reference to that
last benchmark 3dmark time spy extreme
and why would the 79 ATX he perform
slightly below at 4.4 gigahertz
well once I looked into it and did some
temperature tests and stress test with
i-264 well again pull up those
temperatures the 79 80 Hz at 4.4
gigahertz manual overclocked with 1.2
volts was being thermal throttled as
opposed to the 99 ATX II which was well
under that thermal throttle limit didn't
even get to 90 degrees on any single
core where as opposed to the 79 80 XC
that got to a hundred and ten degrees
and it was throttling actually four
percent after stress testing it for over
ten minutes and this has to do with the
thermal paste released on the seventh
gen chip versus the knife gen chip which
is using that stem and the solder
interface material between the die and
the IHS so this is making a massive
difference to the overclocks and
temperatures which will help with
stability as for the three rubber chip
the temperatures were fine but as I said
in the intricate end to get this thing
to 3.8 gigahertz before the whole
motherboard just tripped out as for the
cooler we're using the Animax variant
versus the Intel side where I was using
the corsair RGB platinum so the
temperatures aren't really an
apples-to-apples comparison against the
two different AMD versus Intel
architectures but though temperatures
were both fine on the latest release
chips though in relation to power
consumption here's where things get a
little bit tricky because efficiency
pretty much goes out the window on all
three of these CPUs once you start
overclocking weensy the out-of-the-box
settings
we're actually very well control
hold on these 79 80 XE moving over the
99 8 exe that was getting a higher clock
speed as well as getting 344 watts from
the wall and then these thread River
chip was getting 386 but when we
overclocked the thread River chip that
was going up to 640 watts the Intel was
going up to 494 watts on the 99 80 XE
and then the 79 80 X he was getting 534
watts and this was both at 4.4 gigahertz
so the new refresh is more efficient and
I mean you'd expect it to be since it is
being released over a year later but it
is good to see that you can get higher
over clocks with lower temperatures but
also lower power consumption at the same
time in terms of idle power consumption
the 99 80 XE out of the box went to as
low as seventy eight watts which was
very impressive and very surprising
considering it is 18 cores quad channel
memory was installed and the motherboard
does carry a pretty big chipset but
speaking of chipsets and the support
we've got 44 PCIe lanes on both the 18
core variants versus 60 PCIe lanes on
the thread Ripper 2990 WX also another
difference worth mentioning between the
Intel and AMD chips is that the Intel
chips do carry avx-512 instruction set
the 2990 WX doesn't carry that but
real-world applications for me
personally I didn't really encounter any
so I don't know if that's a factor but
it is something worth mentioning
especially if you're putting this amount
of money on the table for a CPU so of
course now we're coming down to the
conclusion of which is the better CPU
and this is one of those comparisons
where it's really not a clear winner you
can't just say this one is just straight
better than the other as we can see in
some of those benchmarks the 2990 WX
with 32 cores 64 threads can be utilized
in certain applications and if you can
utilize all those calls and threads and
that's all you do and that's probably
going to be a better CPU for you but
that's for the 99 80 XE that is a beast
all round it does everything very well
there was not one bottleneck that we
came into as opposed to the 2990 WX that
quad-channel memory with 32 cores is a
limiting factor especially when we
overclock it in certain applications the
Intel CPU doesn't have any bottlenecks
whatsoever and the single core thread
speeds us
very impressive for an 18 core pod so it
pretty much comes down to this the 99
ATX II is a better CPU than the 79 80 XE
it's got all those improvements so I
wouldn't even consider the older seventh
gen chip unless you could get it for a
much cheaper price but as for the knife
gen versus the 2990 WH that all comes
down to the question of you the user
what do you want to do with these CPUs
what is your intention they're going to
be better at different things for me
personally and my workflow being
predominantly Adobe as well as doing
some multitasking the 18 core 99 ATX II
would be a better choice but of course
if you're a 3d renderer and Maya for
example you might be out of benefit out
of the twenty nine ninety WX getting a
single license and utilizing all those
32 cause you guys hope you enjoyed the
flagship versus refresh flagship versus
the red flagship if you did then be sure
to hit that like button also let us know
in the comments section below
what do you think about these CPUs all
these core counts all these threads love
reading your opinions as always and with
that said I'll catch you guys in another
tech video very soon if you enjoyed this
one you may wish to consider subscribing
hitting that Bell notification or if you
want that inside scoop before it even
gets to YouTube I'm posting up stories
and pictures on Instagram check us out
there tech yes City and also as a
disclaimer the 99 80 XE is a lone sample
I do have to return that the twenty nine
ninety WX is a review sample that I've
kept from last year and I'll catch you
