picked up an i3 system for a hundred
Australian dollars which is about 77 US
dollars however inside it had a p55 UD
3r motherboard from gigabyte and since
his motherboard was literally like the
best P 55 motherboard I've seen in 2017
I decided to pull it out and use it for
a later comparison we're gonna be
comparing four cores from different time
spans though now this PC was missing a
motherboard I decided I would do
something crazy since the only part that
I didn't like in this build was the
power supply which is the next gen 600
watt power supply with only 25 amps and
now when you see a power supply like
this seriously do yourself a favor and
do not use it it's actually dangerous to
use something like this it's a really
crappy power supply they over advertised
the Watts when really what you're
looking for is a strong amp egde on the
12 volt line if you have this from a
decent manufacturer you should be good
to go but if you don't use a power play
like this one which is called a next gen
you not only run the risk of giving your
PC parts bad voltage but also run the
risk of blowing up the power supply if
there's too much power being requested
from it and in that case when that blows
out you can also risk blowing out your
PC parts too
so a little pretty disclaimer before we
get on into this video don't use no name
power supplies please though with all
that aside since I had a budget
motherboard I finally express a terrible
power supply a cooler with no mounting
system I thought I'd do a little
experiment why not zip tie a cooler on
to this motherboard with the 2500 K and
see how high this power supply and all
these components could overclock this
system and so we began overclocking and
we started off with a healthy overclock
of 4.3 gigahertz
at 1.3 volt and what I found
surprisingly was that it did work this
was in a 25-degree and be an environment
and it was actually doing pretty well I
think we got into around 70 degrees
max temperatures after a 10-minute
stress test so this thing was ready to
game at four point three gigahertz
however we were going to take it higher
than this so it was then we've rebooted
the system upped it to 4.5 gigahertz and
then surprisingly it passed at 4.5
gigahertz as well this was at around 1.3
4 volt keep in mind this power supply is
supplying terrible voltage and the
MOSFETs on this motherboard aren't the
best so I was actually surprised that
this thing was kicking it at 4.5
gigahertz and it did so with reaching a
maximum temperature of 90 degrees so we
were pretty much reaching our maximum
threshold at these voltages and at these
overclocks
however we decided just to try 4.7
gigahertz see if it would even boot and
it was at this stage I realized I had
hit a brick wall it would fail to boot
it just gave me error messages I did get
to a blue screen however with about 1.3
9 voltage I didn't want to take it any
higher as this power supply would
probably blow up at this stage I did
actually smell some smoke a bad smell
now if you guys are using a cheap power
supply and if you're in a pinch for
instance if your main components in your
rig for whatever reason have broken down
you've sent them off for RMA and you
need something to get you out of a pinch
and you have a bad power supply lying
around you have an old motherboard a CPU
cooler that doesn't fit then this may
get you out of danger just keep in mind
if you decide to do that seriously don't
overclock your system and also while
we're at it if you smell something bad
coming out of your system even if it's a
decent power supply you have the best of
the best seriously turn your system off
straight away find out where the
smell is coming from and stop using that
part or you may have to fix something
something may be shorting out in the
past I've had one of these cheap power
supplies completely fry on me and while
it's actually in this room smelling
these bad fumes for about half an hour I
then proceeded to vomit so it's actually
a really bad experience one that I've
been through firsthand so anyway guys I
was actually surprised that we could hit
four point five gigahertz on a terrible
power supply budget cool with no
mounting system zip tied onto a budget
motherboard however I didn't stop there
I wanted to start gaming on this machine
especially with the 4.5 gigahertz
overclock so I decided to add in the 650
Ti boost and it was then I had to use a
splitter cable and this is the two
sadhas - one eight pin that can actually
turn into a six pin
they're actually in very handy cables to
have especially if you're using some
server grade power supplies that only
contains six pins so I'll put a link for
these cables in the description below I
always recommend them I have about ten
on hand because I do use a lot of budget
power supplies they're actually a very
good quality and in this case I used it
and at first the 650 T I would not boot
up I was actually quite surprised
dropped in at 660 and then it booted up
and then I put the 650 TI back in and it
was at this stage that it booted up for
some reason so I decided to do some
gaming stress tests and of course the
first game that came to mind was Crysis
3 this thing does tend to max out a
power supply for regular gaming usage
it's actually a very accurate number and
does use more power than a fire strike
combined benchmark the only game that
uses more power than Crysis 3 is mafia 3
but in ways I only consider mafia 3 one
of those terribly optimized games
there's just a bridge game until
Rockstar decided to release the next
Grand Theft Auto sometime in 2025 anyhow
I started playing Crysis 3 at 1080p high
settings the frame rates were terrible
there was frame spikes the 650 Ti boost
just couldn't simply handle Crysis 3 at
1080p but on that note we did score up
to around 165 watts power draw from the
wall so I was actually quite surprised
there's some combo like this again on
this terrible power supply was actually
doing quite well for wattage because
something like this wouldn't even be 80
plus rated it'd be
and maybe 70% region so that did a good
job of using little to no power but when
we decided to change over to a game pub
gee I know people would want to know how
does a 650 t8 boost run on pop G well
the answer is actually quite terrible
and since I recently tested the 660ti
that was really good that could run pub
G at 1080 P very low at around 60 fps
the 650 ti boost however could only run
this game at 720p with around 40 fps at
best so I was really surprised that the
differences between these two graphs
cards and that's why I always recommend
getting more CUDA cores over V RAM for
example the stream processors should be
your main concern when you're buying a
graphs card of course B Ram is important
but the stream process is always the
most important thing on a graphics card
anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this
quick video on terrible power supplies
and they can get you out of a pinch just
keep your nose ready and your senses
ready to go in case something happens
and only use them if you absolutely have
to if you've got to check some business
emails and your main computer as I said
before is getting sent off for apparel
it will tie you over until you can get
something decent or of course if you're
just using a really low powered system
something like a home theater system
that only uses around 50 watts then
something like this should be fine since
it's not getting stressed at all though
with that I was actually happy this
build did turn out ok I was expecting
the power supply to do a little worse
than it did it actually didn't do too
bad in general nothing blew up though
again when I did get into some serious
overclocking I could smell a bad odor
coming out from the power supply so
that's the start of something bad
generally if you smell that warning
start tuning things down if you are
overclocking on a terrible power splay
and let me know in the comments section
below have you had a bad power supply
blow out on you in the past or have you
had RMA even a good power play love
reading your comments and thoughts as
always and on that note I was honestly
surprised with today's combination
terrible power supplies zip-tied cooler
budget motherboard 4.5 gigahertz on the
2500 k and it did so whilst actually
remaining stable and still able to play
games like pop G and then I added the
gravis card in there 60
ta and it still didn't blow out on me so
these budget pals plays although I
highly don't recommend you get one and
be careful with them they can tie you
over if you are in a pinch just don't
overclock like I did today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
