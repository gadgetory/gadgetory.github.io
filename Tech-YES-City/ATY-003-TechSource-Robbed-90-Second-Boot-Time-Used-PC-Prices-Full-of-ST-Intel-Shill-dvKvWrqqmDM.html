episode of address the yes where you
guys write in comments and I try to
answer them as best as I can this week
we are blessed with jaw jaws presence
welcome back to the fold son I hope
you're having a good time
but first question silent would fire he
says damn it put on your glasses much
obliged good sir first thought we got
here edy from tax sauce
he's a place has been burgled into you
guys have been commenting and emailing
me and I just woke up and I saw the news
as well cuz I follow IDI he's actually a
good friend of mine in real life and I
just sucks to hear this dude I'm so
sorry to hear that happen to you if you
need any help or anything like that just
let us know always glad to help you out
coz and in the past he's had my back
when I went to the States there was some
real crazy crap that happened and he had
my back through all that so anytime
brother I'm here to help you out so just
say the word man other than that I mean
he didn't have insurance on the stuff
which sucks
I kind of hate I hope you would if you
know once things get back into action
again please get insurance because yeah
you know losing all that gear man it's
just it's a real pain cuz you work
really hard for your stuff man it sucks
that someone would go and steal it bit
so that sucks to hear but also sucks to
hear that the detective is taking over a
month just to take a look at some
traffic cam footage as well so epic tech
he says can I be praised by the yes man
himself for watching every PC part hunt
from the beginning of day one yes you
can
next up paradox design says everyone by
the data vac so it will come down in
price I do agree
not that inject operation picture
spirits you know what's crackin dude
yeah up to 300 a pulp and I just told
them two species of the normal 1070 oh
fuck yeah let's go get a heap of them
dude alright let's go Aziz yeah I'll go
halfsies with you on all that dude and
that's it ladies and gentlemen just got
a call from the king of the coast and
we're lining up some more 1070 eyes and
10 70s it's time for even better prices
and you could imagine
next up Surya Pratap says is the ex 5460
a good overclocker or anything for the
LGA 771 on a gigabyte P 43 team oboe
thanks in advance and kudos for bringing
such great content thanks very much for
the compliments and the ex 3460 is a
solid overclocker but the problem with
LG SMS m5 is you need good ddr2 memory
and you do need a pretty good
motherboard as well I just had so many
headaches overclocking LGA 775 come with
the fact that the IPC and the power
consumption is just really old compared
to even like a Xeon x34 40 for example
and there they cost little they don't
cost much at all so in my opinion go
grab yourself an X 30 for 40 or even the
X 30 for 30 which is a 4 core for
threaded CPUs similar to the Core 2
quads you can overclock them for next to
nothing and not only that you'll have
ddr3 that'll scale to another build if
you want to upgrade to better builds in
the future the motherboards age 55 as
well they're dirt cheap and it'll
perform better to next iRig and
Marcellus thanks so much for the
compliments man
yes the main gist of it is can you do it
x79 overclocking tutorial and yes I'll
have that coming very soon actually a
lot of people are requesting at doing
x79 over logging tutorials so when you
guys request off enough I will do it and
in terms of comparing the x79 to the
newest gen stuff that's getting delayed
just a little
because there is some stuff on the
horizon that if I compare it to the 8700
K it's kind of just why not wait a
little bit longer and get something
that's up to date so stay tuned for that
but yes x79 overclocking tutorial coming
very soon next up Rumple rat says hey
Brian with all this PC flipping you are
doing have you ever noticed market
saturation in your living area yes and
it's happening a lot more than it's ever
happened in the past it's happening so
bad to the point now if a deal comes up
someone's snapping that deal up in an
hour
like they pay asking price they don't
care so what I'm doing now is I'm trying
to go a step above that and you're gonna
see this channel shift a bit of
direction in the use PC parts hunts I'm
gonna start buying more in bulk now so I
can avoid that and I can get better
deals as well so instead of hunting for
the one-time deals which I'll still do
once a month I'll try to do it I'm not
sure if I'll have the success that I've
had in the past you did this saturation
but it is a big problem in it is a lot
more people get into it my local living
area the Gold Coast is getting much more
competitive Christopher James asked
Brian you like the air 540 bill in the
seven forty now confession time father I
have sinned yes I like the air 540
better than the seven forty reasons
being it just looks a little bit better
I just love the look at the air 540 it's
my favorite looking case airflow is
amazing in both these cases don't get me
wrong and the air 740 has the door that
opens up there's just something about
the 540 I just love it next up we've got
Tyrone II baloney he says ever come in
with an inconsistent problem with the PC
boots and it just won't let you into the
UEFI it takes 69 seconds to boot to
windows if I don't touch the keyboard if
I push the lid on the ass rocks splash
screen it freezes cage it will boot fine
but it let me into the UEFI fi f2 if I
don't go into the blue if I it boots the
windows within a couple of seconds I
feel like I have troubleshooted
everything even flashed the UEFI to the
latest and because the problem is
inconsistent I get it on and off without
changing anything it's hard to narrow
down the issue is my motherboard toast
only a six-week old Z 370 extreme for
your opinion is greatly appreciated I
would it's hard like it sounds like you
don't have other parts to chop and
change with and that's when diagnosing
PC problems gets really hard I would try
changing
different components and seeing if it is
the motherboard of seeing if it's a
different component cause it would very
easily be the hard drive or it could be
the nvme SSD it could be compatibility
issues with memory or it just could be a
number of problems where you're really
not gonna find out unless you change
over parts and really see what it is but
my guess is it's actually bad BIOS
settings I would recommend clearing the
keys the boot keys and then starting all
over again with a fresh install because
I have come into problems in the past
where the computer just won't boot and
then you will just clear this the actual
boot keys up especially with nvme SSDs
and then you are reinstall windows with
a fresh install with that drive and you
should be good to go so maybe if you're
porting that nvme over it might cause
problems just give it a try I mean
backup your data before you do this that
could fix your problems mr. Bryant ey
city what's your P o box please I need
to send you over some bits and bobs to
have some fun with soon from the
overpriced and not so United Kingdom
thanks a lot Phil if you guys have pots
that you no longer want or you just
can't get them fixing and you want to
see me use it in Ken yes fix it then P o
box is right here and thanks a lot for
your donations whatever they are how
small or big they may be Damien Bragg
says yo you got lazy eye
I'm not quite sure I do have a problem I
think where sometimes one of my pupils
is larger than the other so that may
give the appearance of lazy eye but I've
like I actually got a few comments about
this like a year and a half ago and I
started asking my parents my brother all
my friends I'm like y'all if I got lazy
eye and so I guess in this video I'll
get some feedback and see if I really do
have lazy eye next up winter he says
with gddr5 and 5x going to six cool
stuff when and what kind of performance
might the PC community see in regards to
system memory I do understand the system
graphics memory are different thanks
you're talking about ddr4 versus ddr3
and then going to DDR five I got no idea
what their intentions are I think ddr4
for what it's worth it's currently
already saturated at the point where
CPUs can't utilize anything better
and ddr4 there's no point to go to ddr5
but in terms of graphics cards for
instance the new RT x-series they can
definitely utilize GTR 6 vs 5x or 5 and
so there's a need to upgrade to that and
when you think about it's actually kind
of sad the way CPUs and the CPU market
is going that kind of proves that there
really isn't a whole lot of gains in the
CPU IPC improvement itself and instead
you just going for more cores and with
that quad channel and then hex I don't
even know if we'll ever see a exit
channel but we've got octave channel
already our belief so some crazy
advancements next up Robin Blatt says
can you wear a hat no and also he says
how is the workstation working out for
you do you like it for the money or do
you actually prefer if you're editing
your stuffs I love this new workstation
the x79 workstation I'll put the video
up here if you guys haven't seen it it's
just really working out for me and you
guys have seen all the content coming
out I'm doing it on that piece in before
then I had many different pcs so it's a
testament to how good it is
next up Joe lenita also how you don't
man I'd notice he's been around the
channel for quite a while he says he
disagrees with you on the fan speeds I
managed to farm 300 GPUs running 24/7
and there's no need to run the fans at
100% speed you will wear them out faster
and the fans do fail that Delta report
you provided is from 2001 for a 50 mil
industrial grade double fan gear bottom
not using port bearing fans these days
neither are our suits don't believe
crackling ice or myself go over to bits
be trippin channel we has two and a half
thousand GPUs and shows you a bunch of
failed trance on GPUs you also do the
technicians Channel who knows 90 GPUs
and has the videos or failed fans on
GPUs rangy music max fan speeds are the
sake of few degrees matters nothing is
there not throttling and are at safe
operating levels also you have increased
power consumption when you're talking
about 50 plus GPUs and this is the bit
where we're kind of gonna get to a
stalemate because if you had 300
graphics cards it's hard you have to do
an experiment where you've got a hundred
graphics cards at 80% fan speed 160
percent fan speeds 100 at 100% fan
speeds and then from there we could at
least inference some data on how many of
those graphics cards failed completely
actually died how many of them did the
fans just fail and then they switched
off and how many of them didn't have
some others
sort of problem I think with the two and
a half thousand GPUs I would have loved
to have seen 80 percent versus a hundred
percent that would have really a
thousand of each would have given us a
really solid base to work with to get
some really good statistics and numbers
and correlations of coefficients but
since we don't have those numbers and I
haven't done it I haven't done the tests
and no one else has done the tests I
guess we don't know yet
the what would be worse having a GPU
fail due to just heat because your heats
gonna be low with the hundred percent
fan speeds make no doubt about that but
at the same time the fans I agree the
fans would be more likely to fail at a
hundred percent four versus eighty
percent so you got a trade-off there in
my opinion and we have to know the
numbers because replacing a cheap fan is
firm that in my opinion a lot easier
than replacing a whole graphics card
next up chunk says it's a Zeus and not
Asus actually this is a funny thing what
we're gonna do right with this very
video is do a bit of pronunciation and
have captions turned on because I'm
gonna get a bit of feedback for myself
as well
Judit see how the algorithm matches up
with Asus or a Zeus or a s us what some
other ways of saying it as us a sauce
asus asus and from there i'm gonna watch
back this video and see which one hit
the mark and that's actually the most
important one for obvious reasons
next up squishy poo how you been man
he's a long time viewer he says i live
in a town where a strain vacation
company takes a stop the company takes
these people out to the bars and around
town what's the best method of picking
up an Australian girl and what is a
Sheila's favorite drink a different kind
of question but Australian girls they
love in my experience at least a lot of
them love like lemon Russkies and sort
of these sweet drinks that I guess
aren't too sweet but they're easy to
drink so you figure out maybe some
American drinks that are really nice
like that
that aren't in Australia then that could
be a great talking point hey you want to
try this drink it's really nice you
don't have it in Australia and that's
straight away we'll show you the girl oh
hey yeah
research Australia women nowadays I
guess a lot of them want to know that
you care about them and in terms of the
best method for picking up a girl
obviously the more you try statistically
the more chances you're gonna have to
succeed nowadays I think more of a
statistics game I like don't be not
confident and all that other stuff that
you've read but at the same time if you
never try then you'll never know so just
try and talk to the person are usually
with girls like I know in the first 30
seconds you either connect or you don't
connect and to be honest I don't
nowadays I don't want to even get with a
girl who I'm not connecting with so it's
just for me is just a waste of time so
yeah have a chat just say hello best
pick-up line of all time next up Mitch
Baron says hey bud loving the addresses
yes series great stuff I have a question
I've been looking into doing some PC
flipping and I found it very challenging
and I've read that it's a tough thing to
do my question is what is the flip sweet
spot do you flip a certain price point
your rigs fly off the shelves are
building nine hundred dollar bills in
the last few weeks with some bargains
and fail to even sell it yet to high-end
all the best love your channel any bill
that any price point can sell I find the
lower the price the easier it's gonna
sell like even a to $300 PC is gonna
sell faster than a $500 PC the sweet
spot of course is going to be how much
you get the deals for and then how much
you're flipping it for so that's why
this game is so interesting because you
can make money any different price point
it's just you've got to offer value I've
also made a heap of different videos in
the past where they're being vlogs or
different sort of videos talking about
flipping pcs I'll put some links in
description below
next up mister freaky J says hey Brian
have a question that I'm not sure you've
discussed in previous YouTube videos if
suitable you maybe can include in your
next address the yes video when buying
used parts in general not only the GPUs
what is your course of action if you get
a component and it is dead when you test
it back at home do you generally write
it off or immediately bring it to the
attention to sell and try and get your
money back thanks and keep up the great
content creation I have been this is
essentially getting hosed I have been
hosed in the past and unfortunately the
times when I got it I was met this guy
at the servo Station and yeah as soon as
I found out the component was bad I
messaged him like furiously I'm like
you're scamming someone you're saying
something that's working and it's not
working and I never do that to people so
it's it's like I hate it when people do
this
so it's nowadays I like to go pick it up
at someone's home because if there's a
problem I can just rock back up there
and be like yo you sold me a dud
component I want my money back
I really that does trigger me a lot if
someone sells a dud component and if you
try and host someone there's gonna be a
problem but from that I learned a lesson
that was to take a photo their driver's
license if you're meeting in a public
spot I just so you've got some kind of
sort of avenues you can fall back on
next up we got the pro ATS it's 450 for
a mobo what TF is wrong with these
people do they people in computers of
bankers or something and we still need
to be robbed food by fans ourselves
please continue to promote good value
and eff these crooks that want to buy
another youtuber yeah I mean like I'm
not really I'm just doing a video on x3
and I'm VRMs I'm not doing a video on
the value of x3 99 and actually in the
past I've stated that these motherboards
are very expensive same with x2 99 so if
you look at the value for money yeah x3
99 is not where it's at of course I've
got the motherboards there and I I think
maybe it's a good video that people
would be interested in who do have more
money and want to get the 16 core even
the 32 core and so I didn't see any
other videos like it on the internet so
I decided to do a video just with some
simple tests next up rusty bones games
he said he wanted to thank us and he
loves a channel thanks so much
he's build over 400 systems in
Minneapolis MN USA the best bang for my
buck I've gotten recently was in x99
build and that looks like it's some
really good value really good deal man
especially for a 6-quart 12 thread that
is still so relevant to this day you're
paying pretty much for all that gear
what you could get an 80 700 K for and
it performs really close to that awesome
art easy next asks hey when is the video
about health and life and losing weight
coming out very soon I'm aim to get it
done at the end of this month got the
r-tx 2002 cover got a couple of other
videos to do but I'm aiming to get that
out at least the first part
the end of this month followed by the
second part so hopefully you guys will
enjoy it it's coming very soon get ready
next up bring me Peter Pan he says do
you think it would be fine in a case
with a top rear fan near the vrm so
that's 4 X 3 9 9 boards with the X ray
99 the 1950 X or the 29 50 X there's a
16 core CPUs they're gonna be fine with
any of these x-ray 9 boards I was just
testing the 32 core overclocked and that
thing gets insane the power drawer goes
next level and so yeah if you do get
those motherboards make sure you've got
something cooling those VR amps just for
peace of mind at the very least but
answer the question directly I
definitely have the safe or instigator
ad ater up the top pulling air sucking
air out away from the V RMS ID at the
very minimum have that but me personally
I'd be sticking a fan right near it and
sort of angling it to push air right on
those vrm that'd just be me next up
hacksaw mender says king of the coast is
Brian's Tyler Durden perhaps and then
after that master 4 says I think the
king of the coast is less from Brian's
February parts hunt the guy sold six
computers to Brian no he's not next up
we got Paul Hamilton I guess I've got to
address him directly since he's wrote
quite a few comments now about the
sponsored content here on the channel
and he says doing a quick eBay search
for 120 GB SSD is in Australia they go
for about 50 AUD for less than double
the cost you get 7.5 times the capacity
of intel octane but you can't even
mention this in a sponsored video yes
because first of all I'm going to
address this before we even read more of
the question Intel are sponsoring out
the video I'm not gonna recommend an SSD
over their product in their sponsored
video furthermore I don't call it a
review it's not a review I'm not
reviewing opting I keep my use of the
word review sacred and when I use that
word people know that's a different kind
of video altogether furthermore why are
you looking at obtain from a standpoint
of it replacing s s HD s where it's real
value is then extracted not only that
you can place it in a computer that
already has windows installed you don't
have to reformat anything you don't have
to do anything you just put it in
figure it now in terms of octane itself
all that research and development to get
the technology to work the way it does
doesn't come for free and SSDs just an
SSD you can add it to your laptop you're
only gonna have 120 gigabytes there of
SSD storage you can combine obtained
with a two terabyte hard drive and now
that hard drive is working a lot faster
than otherwise would not only that a 2
terabyte SSD costs a lot more than a 2
terabyte hard drive coupled with octane
so octane does have its merits and then
you continue on to say I've never one
time seen you put this in an actual
price to performance build that you put
together for use and/or resale but it's
possible I missed something this that
alone speaks volumes there's a lot of
videos I've missed doing and I haven't
had time to yet and I might just use
octane for the 16 gigabyte module for 28
bucks and coupled with a 2 terabyte hard
drive because it's really good value in
the past I've used SSH D's and builds I
and furthermore have you seen me before
Intel dropped the price on octane did
you see one sponsor video on octane from
me no you know why cuz I didn't believe
it was good value before they drop the
prices yet other people have done
sponsored videos before they drop the
prices so we then goes on to continue
that that alone speaks volumes as if to
sort of take a stab at my integrity I
was gonna say from here on is I've seen
your profile pic it looks like you're
literally 12 years old
I've stopped catering at least in the
last month I've taken a step back on my
channel and I've said okay I'm gonna
stop catering towards younger audiences
so you're gonna no longer see any more
faces in the thumbnail or anything like
that because I'm gonna start taking care
of my audience which is my main chunk at
the moment that's 18 years and older
more Vasili 25 to 34 these are the guys
who watch my content they support my
content all the way through and through
and so I'm gonna stop making so with
that I'm gonna stop catering towards
people who look like what you're doing
your profile pic no offense maybe you
clearly don't get what this is about
you're getting free content from me
where a lot of that content is stuff
like x79 used builds I don't see any
other youtubers doing this kind of
content yet when I take a sponsored
video to put some food on the table
I'm a terrible guy on the shill and then
today dude if you don't like the videos
and you don't like Who I am then don't
watch it man
I'm not forcing you to watch this
content Paul next up we got from mu mu
Intel obtained isn't worth it please
don't do sponsored videos you can't
recommend it to anyone I actually can
recommend it to people that's the thing
in Australian get it for 28 Aussie
dollars for a 16 gig portion it's very
cheap of those prices and you will get a
big benefit over using an old hard drive
not to mention it merges into one drive
next up Montana says the V S series are
really bad there's the power supplies
they can burn your house I've used the V
S series and I will agree that well with
people that they're not for overclockers
if you're overclocking I wouldn't use a
vs power supply but we we had that in
the scum build it's a g40 560 it just
sips power we had an RX 570 which isn't
that power-hungry and here's the thing
when I overclocked the greatest card I
was using about 250 watts from the wall
and that was overclock graphics card so
if you under clock the grout just have
the grab sky running at default and
we've got to take into a portion that
this power draw from the wall also
includes your 3.3 your 5 volt or your
other rails
and the power consumption from those
we'd be lucky to use 200 watts on the 12
volt line not to mention it gets
converted then again and you're losing
efficiency so this thing could be really
drawing maybe just a hundred and sixty
watts which is sort of half it's 12 volt
rating and what it's designed for
I think the veer series is going to be
fine in a lot of cases but maybe if
you're using a vs 350 with like a 4 coy
threaded CPU and a gtx 1080 short draw
the line there you shouldn't be doing
that but in terms of what i use the vs
for in that build I'm sure it's fine
it's absolutely fine next up sly whacker
six to one says so you're pairing a GTX
1060 with an 8700 k nice bottlenecking
new dishonest hack make the video using
a 1080 Ti so I can laugh as you're
exposed for the idiot you are man
there's some hateful comments coming in
first of all sly wakka let's take a look
at your channel and what you consider
quality uploads and I'm just going to
pause there and just facepalm
but anyway here's to address your
question the kicker here is that I have
never seen one person using a 380 110
ATT I never seen one person pair that
combination on the flip side I have seen
someone para 1060 with an 8700 K and
this is actually a lot more common than
an 8100 with a 1080 TI so the point of
that video was to show that the budget
for cor coupled with a mid-range
graphics card is not going to bottleneck
your experience so I don't know who's
laughing now are you still laughing or I
think I'm laughing as I hit the dislike
button on your terrible content
next up shiver says hey Bryan you're
planning on testing the new Rison Athlon
it should be similar to the G 45 60 but
even cheaper and with a better GPU I
haven't realized the new Athlon yet
thanks I gotta take a look at it I'll
see how I go but if it's a good value
proposition yeah we can definitely take
a look at it
next up Wallace says hey B why don't you
put together a techie s cleansing kit
and sell it on your channel I gotta get
some shirts made up first so I've been
trying to get some merch made up for a
while that that's an awesome idea I
definitely have to have some time on my
hands to get something together but if I
did put this together it would indeed be
the tech yes clones kid next up boppin
says I was thinking is a Corsair vs 450
enough in 2018 will it work good in a
gaming PC or should I go with a better
power supply it depends on what you've
got in the components we just talked
about this with the vs 350 if you're
going with like a 4 core 8 threaded CPU
and like a higher-end graphics card
definitely get something better than ps4
50 but if you just go in with a
mid-range card like a GTX 1060 and even
like an 380 100 vs 450 is gonna be fine
but if you are looking at using that
power supply moreover in the future in
upgrading your components definitely
grab like a solid 650 watt power supply
next up we've got Jar gender 69 he says
I don't remember last time I heard this
much bullshit on prices on that exact
same video you should pull up all the
other comments where people are
literally getting better deals than I am
on gravis cards and this happens all the
time on my Twitter as well so maybe
you've just been having too many 69s and
you haven't been checking for deal
next up soon that says Brian please keep
using 12 gigabytes of RAM in this G 4560
built up and filled twelve gigabytes is
enough you don't currently need 16
interested to see how it goes
yeah the thing about the 12 gigabytes is
the reason I don't like doing it because
you do lose jewel channel and then
you've got like a mismatch stick that
will run at the slower speeds so there
are disadvantages to using a
configuration like twelve gigabytes but
the advantage is especially with the G
4560 is you're not really going to
experience any bottlenecks because it's
not such a demanding CPU and you're not
really once you go up maybe an 8700 K of
make more of a difference and definitely
on rising it makes a huge difference but
in this case with a G 4560 it's it's
fine you're going in single channel but
you are getting more memory so 12
gigabytes is better than 8 or 4 and so
if you did run into a memory limitation
the 12 gigabytes would help solve that
next up Julian Benedict says hey Brian
loved the vids and especially this
concept of Q&amp;amp;A I have a question for you
though what do you think of the Chinese
branded SSDs I've been looking on
Aliexpress for cement 2s and came across
this brand King speck seem to have
decent performance and it's priced
decently - what are your thoughts yay or
nay cheers I've only had one King spec
boy I think is a king Dion and it's
rocked up and someone donated it to me
but it was already dead so I've got a
dead King Dion here but in terms of a
king spec if you buy it off Ali it's
going to be guaranteed to work if it's
not you can get your money back but I
haven't tried one yet so I couldn't
quite tell you but I'm sure they'll be
ok I mean they all use the same OMS from
the same factories and then just solder
it all together hope you enjoyed this
week's episode of addressed the yes
episode 3 if you did then be sure to hit
