things that I've never really had too
much concern for though whenever I seem
to be handling paths or building a
computer there's always something in the
comments session that just goes off and
goes oh man you have to wear an
anti-static wrist wrap when you're doing
that where's Ranger static bill is that
man you're gonna completely destroy
those parts and so since I've got this
hundred dollar PC in the back here and
I've already been running a few tests on
it I thought hey why not just charge
myself up and then touch the pots and
then see if it still turns on so let's
do a couple of tests
welcome back to tokyo city ladies and
gentlemen this is Brad coming back to
you guys there with a video on static
electricity and how much of it is a bad
thing and so before doing this video I
did watch another video from a channel
called do-it-yourself trying and now the
video was very entertaining and it was
very funny and one thing that a did show
is that static electricity can damage
parts though I just think the conditions
were not even remotely similar to a
real-world environment and so today I'm
going to try some real-world conditions
touch these parts and see if the
computers well the computer still boots
up
so first up here we have the Seagate
hard drive so I'm just going to quickly
charge myself put it in the computer see
if it boots up
so here's test one and it looks like
it's a pass for the hard disk drive so
charging ourselves up on the carpet and
then touching the hard drive and then
stalling it to a ungrounded computer
still results in this computer booting
up into Windows let's move on now to
part two here's test number two the
memory and the computer is still loading
so it's like test number two is passed
as well so now we'll try the graphics
card
so here's test number three this is the
graphics card and it's booting up
everything's booting up fine so let's
get on to the final test now where I'm
going to charge myself up as best as I
can and then touch the motherboard which
is essentially connected to everything
and then we'll try and see if it turns
on okay so here is the final test I just
thought I'd show you guys without any
breaks or anything like that so looks
like it might have froze this time
around I might have froze on boot let's
try and restart it
okay looks like it's booting this time
so let's uh let's move on to a
conclusion this is booting and it looks
like it yeah it's booting into Windows
absolutely fine so for tests and for
passes let's move on to conclusion now
so in conclusion besides working up a
sweat we didn't manage to damage any of
these components that's not to say
though that static electricity can't
damage computer parts I think the
do-it-yourself training video already
proved that you can very well damage
computer components with static
electricity in the sense that you're
over vaulting or putting too much
voltage through the said components
however I mean it was kind of pointless
in a way because as overclockers we
already know that if you put too many
volts through a component you'll fry it
so basically with my tester I wanted to
test hey in real-world conditions
rubbing your feet on carpet
whatever producing a certain you know
just a little bit of static electricity
is that enough to damage computer
components and in the last case we saw
that my computer didn't boot properly so
that was pretty interesting though none
of the components are damaged and as
I've also as a final test I did decide
to take it down on the weekend to the
park and go down the slippery slide
where I actually managed to zap the
computer and so it still survived so how
much static electricity a component can
take I don't know exactly I'm not a
scientist I'm just a tech review though
I will say this in closing when you're
handling sensitive parts go ground
yourself before you do so that's what my
recommendation has always been around
here either by just touching a grounding
point in your house or if you can't find
a grounding point just go outside and
touch your car though if you are one of
those people who are just constantly
shocking everything you touch then you
may wish to indeed go out and buy an
anti-static wristband or an anti-static
builder's mat that's up to you
personally I don't need that I don't
believe in that my 15 years of building
computers I've never broken apart after
I've statically shocked something hell
I've had parts spark up in front of me
and they've still worked so that's why
I'm kind of a little bit I guess a
little bit anti anal retentive if
that's a way to describe it against the
whole static electricity thing and I
will say at the end of the day I did my
test here and none of the components
were damaged and this was beyond the
normal level of statically shocking
things I went beyond the mile I didn't
know what the results would be I didn't
know that's why I tested it on my cheap
rig that already has four dead RAM slots
and that's how it came when I bought it
so so that's it from me guys please give
it a big thumbs up if you liked this
video or if you have any questions or
comments then drop a comment in the
comment section below and I will get
back to you as soon as I can
and that's about it I'm going to go
drink some mango juice this is getting
pretty hot in here anyway
I'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon peace out now
bye for circuitry so what I've done with
this memory of us sprayed on seven
different kinds of spray paint so on the
right we got a white gold silver pink
black and white I've just sprayed it all
on made sure I've got it on the circuit
there so I'm just going to put this
memory and see the computer boots up</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
