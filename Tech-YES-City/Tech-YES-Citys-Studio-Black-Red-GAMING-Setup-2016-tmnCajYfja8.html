on my setup and also applying some
finishing touches and I wanted to share
it with you guys today as well as ed
from tech sauce he'll be featuring this
set up on his channel in the
not-too-distant future as well
I
Oh
you
take a bit of time with you guys and
explain everything i'm using this setup
and why i'm using it so starting from
the left here is the bay ring of b2 pro
microphone now pick this up for forty
dollars absolute steal at this price and
it's a great condenser microphone for
doing voiceovers and also doing my
texture with joker every week besides
that we have the acer 1080p monitor here
this I got this monitor literally like
eight years ago so it's actually got
ccfl backlighting and it's a ten panel
with a clear gloss coating I actually
really love this monitor it used to be
my old gaming monitor and above that you
can probably see the Logitech c920 which
is a great webcam now over here is just
another keyboard and mouse that i use a
Logitech G 3 that's old school as well
and then it's my Microsoft economic 4000
as well so all the gear here is kind of
nostalgic as well a little bit and I do
use this for the tech show when i'm
using this monitor on the left the asa
then at the background there you could
probably see the zoom h2n which is a
field recorder i should actually be
using that for this voiceover but it's
much easier to maneuver around with a
lavalier microphone attached to me so
besides that we have the Fidelio x1
headphones there they're great and then
we've also got a GTX I think it's a 285
I believe from Nvidia their old-school
card and never use it anymore and then
we've got over here a exilim 1000 fps
camera that's what's of capturing
latency when I measuring latency it
gives out terrible resolution at a
thousand FPS but nonetheless you can
still measure latency now to the left
and that is the Acheron vision monitor
that's a 1440p IPS display I use this as
a secondary productivity monitor when
I'm working from my main 4k monitor here
editing videos or whatnot and then below
that is a bay ring up be a xenyx 802
which is a good mic preamp for amping
the bearing of b2 pro then besides that
we've got the speakers there they're the
Sony desktop speakers I pick them up
from the junk store for three dollars
and they sound absolutely amazing then
you probably notice their attempt sensor
for ambient temps that's when i'm
testing cpus and then moving to the
right of that we've got the
ISA to a th cave monitor this thing is a
beast it's a 4k g-sync 60 Hertz panel
it's also got great response times in
low input lag which is why I really like
this monitor even though it's a little
bit expensive and then besides that you
can probably see the greenery that is to
give me some fresh air and then below
that we've got some gaming peripherals
here these are my two favorite at the
moment we've got the azo RGB keyboard
this has got blue switches in it from
kale which are really good and not not
only that it's just such a great high
and keyboard not not only aesthetically
but in performance as well then all that
is housed on the razer goliathus
extended control edition and then beside
that we have the logitech G 30 to hang
onto my main rig here this is the specs
that it's got but we'll start off with
the headphones to get them out of the
way with these are my Fidelio l ones
slow comfortable most comfortable pair
of headphones have ever used not only
that the sound signature is warm it's
subtle and it's great for long gaming
sessions and I can also plug the v-moda
boom pro in it even though I've had to
mod the headphones a little bit with a
zip tie just to get that v-moda burn pro
on which is actually what the microphone
I've been using on the live show when I
was in America and people actually
comment on how good it sounds so great
combination there if you're looking for
something just for everyday use and long
term use now besides that we below that
actually we have the objective to
amplifier and the shit modi this is
called the frankenstein combo great for
high-end listening the only problem is
for every day listening you'll hear a
lot of nuances so i actually don't use
it that much unless i want to listen to
some real good flac audio files with my
fidelio x1's now moving on to drives I
actually can't pull these out at the
moment but over there we've got a 500
gigabyte SSD one terabyte backup drive
and also a 256 gigabyte MX 100 for
temporary recording and whatnot from my
desktop moving onto this bad boy here
this is the arikil strike x case and
it's actually an open sort of closed
hybrid formula here i've done a review a
little while ago but it's basically it's
a great case once it's all set up it's
very hard to get a power supply in and
out of the
case however it does function really
well once you get all your gear in there
now in here is an NM ax t 40 with a
custom spread fan there on the 58 20 k
which is clock 24 points 2 gigahertz at
the moment and then that's housed on the
asrock x99 motherboard i've also got 16
gigabytes of ddd are for memory there
and a gigabyte gtx 970 g1 now the reason
I'm using this gravis card is that my
980 TI recently died so this is the
temporary solution until I find out
what's happening with my 980 TI last
part of the setup is my playstation 4
and i don't really use it that much i'm
actually waiting for the final fantasy 7
HD remake to come out and then we've got
that connected to the toshiba HDTV it's
a 32 inch TV i only really use this for
watching movies and also using mine ass
if i need to change some settings and
that's where the nass is housed to the
right that's my ghettoness that i
recently built on my channel and it
basically has three terabytes of backup
data there and it serves as a home
theater PC for this TV below that we
have a dell keyboard and a Logitech g600
mouse which I don't rarely use they're
not really my thing below that we've got
some other gear here this is my home
theater I've got 5.1 surround sound in
here and this is the middle speaker and
the receiver and then we've got some
nostalgic items there Baldur's Gate 2
and W OCD and Star Wars the whole six
episodes there and then in this case
actually down here we've got some retro
gear I don't know if you can see it
we've got a super nintendo nintendo 64
i've also got on my thermal paste memory
sticks and my Nintendo Wii and I thought
the wii was probably the worst thing in
that case now to the left of that we've
got my 2.1 receiver there and then over
in the corner there we got some boxes
which is pretty much just to cover up
some of the wall and cables so it
doesn't look too bad underneath the desk
as you can see here I've just used a lot
of tape a lot of cable bags and also got
LEDs under here
and yeah pretty much using a variety of
tapes velcro tapes zip ties duct tape
you name it i'm using it so that's
pretty much cable management if you'd
call it that but it definitely does the
job because no one can really see it
from the outside which is what I guess
cable management is all about so that's
it for my main set up downstairs if you
guys like this video then be sure to
give it a big fat like and I'll come
back to you guys with another tack video
also if you guys want to see a full
house tour then let me know in the
comment section below and I'll try and
get that done in the next few weeks I've
actually got a secondary tack room which
I'm sure some of you guys will be asking
about the blue room that's getting a
mini overhaul at the moment and that's
mainly for testing video games and parts
as well as benchmarking and also doing
b-roll don't know guys I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
