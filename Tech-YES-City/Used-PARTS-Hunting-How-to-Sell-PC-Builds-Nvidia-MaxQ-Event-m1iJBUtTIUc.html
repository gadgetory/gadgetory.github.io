where I'm going to be used parts hunting
for you guys and also checking out some
upcoming projects and answering a big
question of what do I do with my used
builds and how do I sell them welcome
back to tech yeah City this is Bryan to
your yes man coming to you guys today
and we're going to get on straight into
the used deals what's up on gumtree
we're going to put it on that bogan
voice and sin if we can find some deals
so it's pretty rough this month all the
AMD cards are pretty much sold because
of this earth remaining craze there's
like even the r9 280 s and stuff like
that there's just none of them for sale
but there are some old-school gtx 660 s
and also 660 t is that popped up so i'm
going to give them a call see if they'll
take a lowball offer and also there is a
desktop pc that's come up but I'm really
going to lowball this because I don't
think anyone's put on an offer on it and
I'd love to get it for a budget build so
usually with Gumtree guys if you sound
completely normal 100% normal people
don't want to sell you the parts so this
month we're going to be putting on like
a surfer who's just starting to express
his bogan as' and we're gonna see how
that goes hey man how you going yeah so
you add on gumtree four to six six TTI's
yeah man would you take 110 for my I
don't really want to go any lower than
150 they come with the sli bridge as
well so long as you got a motherboard
which is compatible
yeah they the sli bridge is that needed
yeah if you want if you want to get the
best performance you'll need the sli
bridge otherwise they sort of they work
together but I'd only like 30%
efficiency
I see mate yeah what is the due date
include the sli bridge ah if I didn't
include the SLI bridge
I guess maybe I'd say 120 130 is
probably as long as I want to go 120
you like to do that um if you could pick
it off that would be more okay mate just
text us your address and I'll come and
get it when's best for you mate
Oh looky that's nice
I've got work Sunday through Tuesday til
late sorry either tonight or Wednesday
afterwards okay mate what time it's you
all right what time until tonight mate
that topknot yeah what time can you know
okay anytime you want to come around
preferably before like 10 o'clock okay
mate just Texas the address mate yeah
will do thanks mate right so we picked
up to 660 t is for 120 Australian which
i think is like 90 USD so that's 45 USD
a pop that's pretty good and since
they're like to customers Zeus models I
think we got a deal there okay so this
next deal is a 660 and I put in a 40
Australian dollar off which would be
like 30 USD so hopefully the guy takes
it there's actually no number there so I
don't know how that will go
hey man are you going yeah I saw you out
on gumtree for a PC it's an AMD phantom
- yeah you got a hundred and fifty on it
mate but I I got 50 bucks would that be
all right okay man it's just that it's
pretty old you know and I just need
something forward
I just I need something for Microsoft
Word no worries mate thanks for that so
they wanted 150 Australian for their PC
and it's only got four gigabytes of RAM
and it's a really old phenom and you
would honestly have to replace it with a
fork or phenom or even a sex call for it
to be relevant in today's games and then
believe it's only a dual-core off the
top of my head so really weak I'd
honestly probably only pay $50 for that
computer so 150 in my opinion is a
little bit too much for what that PC was
now also another question that I get
asked quite a lot is what do I do with a
lot of the used builds that I put up on
the channel do I sell them do I keep
them and now if I kept all those builds
man I wouldn't be able to have a house
to stay and they'll just be a room full
of computers so yes I do sell them and
there's also some tips and tricks that
I've got for you guys if you want to
build use pcs and sell them in the first
biggest tip I have is that the cosmetics
are actually just as important as the
hardware inside depending on the price I
kind of think of it as a correlation
between price and cosmetics in other
words the more expensive a PC becomes
the more you have to kind of focus on
cosmetics in order to sell that build
this is just what I've found personally
because I've put up in the past some
really good pcs with really kick-ass
hardware and they just haven't sold but
then when I've changed the case around
and made it look really nice that's when
they're sold straight away and I've even
gotten more money than I was initially
asking after I did the case change
so now with the build that I built
recently the extreme budget $175 PC I'm
actually going to add in a new hard
drive and also be throwing in a new case
this is the BitFenix Nova this is the
wide edition it's a really inexpensive
case it's got a side panel and actually
looks really good to the eye wants to
build finished so now the reason for
doing these two things the first one is
the hard drive I want the customer to be
satisfied this hard drive will speed up
the build actually by quite a lot and
all been a lot less risk of this person
having problems with this builders I
think that hard drive that I put in that
build was pretty much near its last legs
or it's just really old and it's just
really slow and then the case of course
really adds to the cosmetics and since
both these components cost around an
extra hundred dollars to the build I can
then add that on to the cost and also
get a really smooth and quick sale and
also some other tips if you actually
want to make a little bit of money off
the builds is of course you've got to
pick up the bargains it's all about
getting really good deals on the parts
whether it be the motherboard CPU combo
or the graphics cards and the memory or
the case if you get those really good
deals that will enable you to make
profit and I also found out with the
mid-range pcs is really where you want
to be making builds for I find in
Australia around the five to six hundred
dollar mark if you can build those real
budget pcs for around two hundred three
hundred dollars you can easily sell them
for five hundred to six hundred dollars
though if you start building pcs that
are plus one thousand dollars then it's
actually really hard in my opinion to
make any money in that price segment
unless of course again you get really
good deals which I don't really see any
people selling GTX 10 70s and upwards
for really cheap anyhow I also had to
remove this shroud so the cooler would
fit in properly but how cool is that
you've got fake heat pipes on this thing
whoo so now these are my spotlights I
brought these back from Japan and the
problem is they need a converter but I
need these converters I'm running out of
these converters so I figured our wires
will just convert these plugs manually
so I don't need a converter
so there's our new us converted to
Australian power plug let's try it out
success so now here's a little side
project I'm working on this is LGA 775
with a Q 6600 now I wanted to overclock
this and then throw in like an RX 560
and also a gtx 1050 TI and see how well
they compared to modern age CPUs because
i think that would be a cool kind of
review to do with something like these
two graphics cards now also gigabytes
Oris lineup of graphics cards sent over
there gtx 1069 gigabits per second
edition so i want to be testing this
against the msi gtx gaming z 1060 and
also to retest it against the RS 580 so
let me know what games you guys want to
be tested because i want to get a nice
even balance of games that aren't too
skewed to either AMD or nvidia and do a
retest and see which ones come out on
top and i will be overclocking these
graphics cards and also including the
stock figures too so hopefully you guys
will enjoy that now a subscriber sent
this over this is a z87 x motherboard
and they also sent over a four core i5
4690k with it - and some memory so i
believe they wanted me to test it out
and see if I could get it working I'm
not too sure if it works or not but
thanks a lot Tim for sending this in and
if it does work then I will be doing
something like a giveaway with this PC
because I want to do a full use build
and also there's a new build coming to
the channel - which I'd be giving away
but stay tuned for that and also today
we'll be testing on this motherboard and
seeing if it works I also picked this up
here for $1 this is my new water flask
check it out it's got the top gear on
there what a bargain
ok so now it's time to see if this thing
boots up or not and we notice I've used
different memory to the memory I was
given that's straight away just
something I can easily diagnose if there
is a problem so if it boots up Oh
shish kebobs that was not good and try
that one more time ok something it
sounds like the vrm has maybe fried on
this thing oh that did not sound good
try and switch it off and but yeah
something's definitely smoked up on this
build Wow
yeah something is extremely wrong on
this PC and the motherboard easily would
be in my opinion the mother will be
fried because I can smell actually
summer coming off this board at the
moment sir really not good at all
so there it is guys I know that smell
straightaway and that is a burnt-out
MOSFET on the top line of this vrm here
it's also got the imprint on the
heatsink too so this one's been
overclocked either extremely high or
something's happens just a faulty vrm
but the CPU could still be good and of
course the memory could still be good so
that's a bonus I will check those out I
just don't have them for placement test
it
you
you
so I just got back and now I picked up
three graphics cards for a total of 160
Australian dollars I think that works
out to be around about 120 USD so what
we got for this money was two 660ti s
and also one gtx 660 now the 660 isn't
anywhere near as powerful as a 60 CTI
and also back in the day I believe the
660ti was kind of a little bit
controversial because its bandwidth on
its memory was cut from 256 bit down to
192 bits and even though it kind of
performs similar to it 670 in some
circumstances it didn't in others so
with this graphics card I actually
personally really liked it especially at
the price point that it came in at
because in certain games all you had to
do was drop down the msaa settings and
memory and tense settings and you had a
really powerful card now it's going to
be great to see how this GPU couples up
with that AMD six core phenom that I got
and then I'm going to be putting that in
next month build that's going to be a
really good price performance PC I can't
wait to bring that to you guys as
opposed to putting these things in sli
though I don't know we'll see how we go
but SLA has been one of those things
that I haven't been too keen on and then
we had that motherboard that thing was
frying on the VRM there's pretty much no
coming back from that I mean you can
replace the MOSFETs if you have really
good surgical skills that's one of my
weak points I couldn't see myself
replacing that vrm personally I just
think it's impossible for me to do my
hands are kind of really rough you guys
know me from the past they drop a lot of
things I am clumsy with things sometimes
so something like that is not a task
that I'd be able to handle and then
lastly of course we had those builds
that get put up for sale and one thing
that I like to tell you guys is that
cosmetics is pretty important even
though some of the times those builds
look dirt cheap and they are dirt cheap
and they perform really well when it
comes to selling them I do a lot of the
times upgrade the case and put it in
something more better in terms of
cosmetics and that has actually helped
with the sale a lot
and this week I also managed to fly down
to Sydney I live on the Gold Coast
currently so it's about a one-hour
flight and I went to the Nvidia event
where they were displaying their max-q
laptop designs and essentially the term
max-q I believe is derived from rocket
ships with NASA when the rocket reaches
its maximum point of pressure and that's
the point that they have to design the
rocket ships for so essentially with
that term bringing it into laptops it's
within videos gravis cards the GTX 1072
1080s they're essentially under vaulted
the gravis cards to that point where
they're most efficient with performance
and so this allows them to fit in GTX 10
70s and 10 80s into really thin laptops
and still keep the noise low so I
believe the limit there is 40 decibels
and the laptops were really thin I think
this is a true gaming laptop something
that you can actually cart around it
only needs one power brick and it's not
as big as some of those really massive
laptops one which I've reviewed on the
channel recently this was the GT 73 and
although it was extremely powerful it
just wasn't really practical in terms of
portability however this is where the
max-q design laptops are really
practical and they still are very
powerful and I was really surprised to
see there's just no AMD graphics cards
for sale that mining craze is real it's
a craze that ain't stopping anytime soon
any AMD graphics card that was up for
sale was ridiculously overpriced anyway
guys let me know in the comment section
below what was your favorite part of the
video today and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon and also
