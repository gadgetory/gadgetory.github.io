Rison 3 and it's going to be a very
basic tutorial today we're we're just
going into the bus and changing only a
few settings around to extract a lot
more performance out of our rising three
CPUs especially the 1200 if you recently
purchased it now if you do want to go
more advanced and overclock to higher
levels and you have a better cooling
solution then I will put my X 370 and 8
core rising overclocking tutorial in the
description below
however today we're going to be taking
things real slow kind of like that first
date with your foot anyway you're going
to need two programs I recommend
Cinebench r15 and also I 264 now put the
links in the description for both these
programs and I want you to install them
and then you are now ready and we can
move on and get started with this
tutorial
you're welcome back to check yes city
and now on the desktop we've downloaded
those two programs out of 64 and also
Cinebench r15 now before we do anything
I want you guys to open up out of 64 and
now you don't have to buy a license key
you'll probably get a trial version but
that's okay with the trial version we
can go to tools and then click on system
stability test and you should be able to
hit the start button and once you do
that I want you guys to leave this
running for 10 minutes and now the whole
purpose for doing this is actually
twofold the first reason being we want
to establish a baseline for temperatures
so after we start overclocking if our
temperatures are going too high then we
know that we're doing something wrong
secondly we also want to make sure that
there's no problems with our computer
before we start overclocking because
after we lock in some settings if we
having problems that are already there
before we started overclocking then that
will just add a lot of headaches and
frustration which we don't need so let
this run for 10 minutes you can also
click on the CPU ID button and that will
bring up the speeds for your CPU you can
see here we've got 3.1 gigahertz or 3094
megahertz here which is the base speed
of a Rison 3 1200 you will also notice
that the memory speeds are displayed
here and we've got ddr4 21 33 megahertz
which will be overclocking in the second
half of this tutorial but let's run this
for 10 minutes and we'll come back and
after we've hit the f2 or the Delete key
or you can hit both of them at the same
time I actually prefer to span both
these keys until I'm into the bus we
then get to the menu here and this is
the asrock bias now different biases
will have different interfaces that look
a little bit different I know for
example on gigabytes motherboard you
have to hit the f6 or f7 key to get into
advanced mode which is where I recommend
and then once you're in this fast you
can hit the left and right arrow keys on
your keyboard and go over to overclock
Tweaker and now you should see some
settings here with the CPU frequency and
voltage change so basically in this tab
I want you guys to hit enter and then
click manual so we hit the down arrow go
to manual and then we'll bring up the
CPU frequency and now we want to dial
this in
a 3,800 that's what we want to press and
then press ENTER and now we should have
3.8 gigahertz dialed in to our CPU now
of course you can go higher but this is
a level that I believe practically
everyone should be able to obtain for
instance I was able to get four
gigahertz on this CPU on this particular
CPU but I did have to ramp up the
voltage quite considerably now we go
down to this next tab CPU voltage so we
hit the down arrow we go down here and
we type in one decimal three point nine
I believe that's about where you'd top
out at I believe if you if a computer
doesn't boot at this voltage with this
speed then I'd imagine you are very
lucky and you may want to go here and
change it to three thousand seven
hundred at which point it should be
guaranteed to work
however three thousand eight hundred not
on the voltage sorry that was a mistake
three point eight gigahertz at one point
two nine volt should be absolutely fine
however keep in mind though on your
keyboard you do have the plus and minus
arrows which you can also use if the
numbers are not working themselves so
you can actually manually change up and
down the voltage with the arrow the plus
or minus keys on your keyboard so
they're the first two settings we're
going to lock in and usually in a
different BIOS and practically every
bias that I know on the AMD rise in
architecture you can go down and go to
save user defaults and this is saving a
profile so we can work on this if we
have any problems so we're going to do
is go to enter and type in three
thousand eight hundred megahertz
overclock and this will be our
overclocked profile we've then saved it
and now after you've done this you will
actually want to go up here to the top
right hand corner to the exit tab with
the left and right arrows and then click
enter to save changes and exit and click
yes so now if all has gone well then you
should be on the desktop with a rising
three CPU that is now at 3.8 gigahertz
keep in mind if you want to apply this
tutorial to arise in five six core arise
in seven eight core then you may need to
increase the voltage and with that you
better cooling so just keep in mind that
this tutorial today is specifically for
a risin three CPU so once we've done
that we can open up either 64 again and
go to the same menu that we did before
so we want to test the temperatures we
want to make sure our computer is
completely stable and if it's not stable
if something's crashed in this test or
if something's crashed and you can't
even boot to Windows that was just me
shutting it down if you shut it down
without closing down the program it will
bring up that message so don't freak out
about that so what we want to do is
start and we want to leave that again on
for 10 minutes
now while this test is running I'll
quickly talk about what you can do if
your computer is crashing in a dozen
boot into Windows and if this is the
case you can then take out your little
CMOS battery it's a little circular
battery on the motherboard and plug all
the power off and leave this off for a
good minute and then put that battery
back in and this will essentially reset
the bus there's also a clear CMOS jumper
that you can switch the jumper from the
left to the right and that should also
clear the CMOS as well or if you're
lucky enough to have a good enough
motherboard it'll have a little clear
CMOS button on the back which you just
tap this and you're now reset back to
default settings so now that we've
overclocked to 3.8 gigahertz we can see
that the temperatures have gone up to
around 56 degrees which is still really
good we've still got a lot of headroom
for overclocking even further if we wish
to and keep in mind this is on the race
stealth cooler which is the stock cooler
that comes included with the Rison 3
1200 if you have a bigger and better
cooler then you should see even lower
temperatures though I don't really
recommend it on this CPU since it
doesn't use up much power to begin with
so 56 degrees if you want to take this
23.94 gigahertz you guys can do so in
your own spare time however once this
overclock is done within click stop and
it's pretty much stable at this point it
may be unstable if you have a crashing
games for example that wasn't there
before the overclock then you may have
to go back into the boss and just down
clock it to 3.7 gigahertz or you may
have to give the voltage a little bit
more so it's pretty much a direct
correlation between speeds and voltages
and temperatures when it comes to
overclocking so now you can see here
I've opened Cinebench up and what we can
do is run this vent
mark just to make sure that our numbers
are 3.8 gigahertz is actually concrete
and now beforehand I believe we've got
around 470 Cinebench points with the
risin 12 out of the box at around 3
point 1 gigahertz after we do this we
should be getting well into the 500s I'd
say close to 600 and that will give you
an idea of how much performance we have
gained with such an easy overclock so
we've got 564 Center bench points and
this is also without any overclocks to
the memory as we pointed out before
there was 2,000 133 megahertz memory
speeds currently on this system and now
with Rison you will want to overclock
your memory it's very important to get
benefits in not just any program in
general but also gaming and your frame
rates are pretty much directly
correlated to your memory speeds on
Rison just like they are correlated to
your clock speeds so with that said
let's move on now to part two of this
overclocking tutorial so now we want to
go back into the bus and back to
overclock Tweaker the same tab where we
overclock the CPU as we can see here
we've got 3.8 gigahertz and 1.29 voltage
roughly on the core volt and then what
we want to do is load XMP profile and we
can press profile 1 and now what this
will do is we'll load up a profile
that's automatically stored in your
memory to give these settings for the
memory to boot up at a guaranteed speed
however there is a big problem with
Rison and that is a lot of the times the
XMP profiles don't properly work with
the motherboards and I'm lucky in this
case that my Crucial Ballistix memory it
works at 3200 megahertz
however we don't just do that well there
is another very important setting if
we're going for high memory speeds with
Rison and that is this setting here the
system-on-chip voltage now in different
motherboards it will behave in different
ways but what we wanted to do here is
press the plus key and we want to give
it a good 100 millivolts sometimes you
might want to give it a little bit more
but really don't go past 150 millivolts
just yet I'd recommend it giving it a
solid 100 millivolts which is what we
see here 105 millivolts and then we can
leave that and try and lock in our X and
P profiles and then we quickly go to
save and exit and give that a try
so now if your computer managed to boot
up in the XMP profiles then you don't
need to go any further with this
overclocking tutorial you now have a cpu
running at 3.8 gigahertz and you can
also go back in and try and up to 3.9
for gigas that's up to you and you've
also got your memory set and you should
be having a really good experience now
on Rison however this next part is for
someone who is having problems with
their memory speeds for instance they've
tried locking in this XMP profile
however your computer is crashing and
you've had to go back and clear the CMOS
with the battery take it out or do the
other two methods that we mentioned
before and now you're back to square one
you don't know what to do with these
memory timings so what we can do is we
can try and load up that profile again
and it will give us the DRAM frequency
and what we want to do is we want to
lower it to 2666
now every stick of memory that I've had
go through a Rison has been able to be
overclocked to 2666 megahertz I haven't
had one stick that hasn't gone this high
of course I've had sticks that have gone
to 29 33 and now this memory goes to
3200 megahertz so your mileage may vary
but as with these overclocking tutorials
I'm sort of locking in something that is
guaranteed and I believe 2666 should be
guaranteed so now after we've locked
that in so we've changed our memory
speed group down clocked it and what we
want to do is we want to go to D Ram
timing configuration and now in this tab
we'll get a lot of different timings
which is kind of scary because I have
had 20 666 just from the get-go not work
so what we want to do is we want to
actually change this to 16 this timing
here the cast latency change this one to
17 and then go down and change this to
17 and this one also to 17 and this last
one here to 40 I found I've never had a
problem once I've locked in these
timings on any stick of memory that I've
put through this system it is important
to mention there is another setting as
well called the command rate and you can
drop that to 2 T if nothing else is
working however some biases don't have
this option as well which further
confuses things but for what it's worth
we can try and leave that at 1 T which
is best for Rison and performance and
now that we've done that we can then go
to the
Save Changes in exit and then boot back
into Windows
so we've now loaded back into our
desktop and the first thing we can do is
yet again go back into I 264 open that
up and go to the cpuid tab so tools
cpuid
and what we should see here is the
memory speeds they should be confirmed
26 61 so that's roughly the speeds that
we locked in very close and we've also
got the timings there as well that we
locked in so the last part in this phase
is to quickly go to the stability test
yet again so tools stability tests and
then this time we can uncheck everything
else but stress memory so we can do this
for roughly again 10 minutes and you
should be fine you should know that your
computer is completely stable at these
settings and now that you've done
testing your memory for a good 10
minutes we can then open up Cinebench
and then try and run another final
Cinebench score as we can see here we
scored two points higher so you should
get a very slight increase in
performance in Cinebench with your
memory speeds being now higher but the
best benefit will come when you start
gaming anyway guys if you enjoyed
today's video then be sure to hit that
like button and let me know in the
comment section below what overclocks
you achieved on your rising 3 system or
on your actual other system if you don't
even have a rising three and you're
watching this tutorial I'm hoping you
guys got some big games just like I did
on the system I used here today of
course
Rison is a little bit problematic with
some of the memory so be sure to be
careful with that if you're overclocking
and also if you had any troubles or
anything that was confusing in today's
video then be sure to drop a comment in
the comment section below and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can
or if I don't answer the comments then
you can head over to tech city TV slash
forum that's our website and there is a
lot of guys just like me who will be
able to help you easily if I don't get
back to you in the comment section
