the void Pro RGB which yes has RGB and
the only reason I can think of why is
probably this aggro of Kish which
speciation larger group and then I
decided to do something different with
this review and that was compare my
current v-moda headset that is a v-moda
boom for a mic plugged directly into a
pair of crossfade LP and also pit that
against Cougars immersive pro headset as
well and the results are going to be
different to a typical headphone review
tech yes City the place to live the
place to stay and the place to get an
RGB gaming headset apparently well
Corsair have done it they've implemented
RGB lighting on a pair of speakers that
rests on your head though it is subtle
and not very in-your-face bling bling
which I do give them credit for and in
this particular model it is rated for up
to 12 meters of range and 16 hours of
battery life in practice on these
wireless headsets I got 10 meters of
range in my house and 12 hours of
battery life while gaming so pretty
lengthy and the comfort of this headset
was good very good to the point where
you could game on it for hours and hours
and not notice that you're wearing them
with the weight of 380 grams the ear
cups are also removable and have a
breathable material so you is sweat less
and of course the inner diameter of the
speakers is 50 millimeters so will fit
ears of small to medium range however
contrast that to our friends the Cougar
immersive pro they have a 100 millimeter
ear tops and will fit very large is with
an inner diameter of 63 millimeters and
they're also extremely comfortable as
well weighing in at 350 grams so of
course what about that sound quality
let's start off with a non gaming
headset for reference that is my
crossfade LPS from v-moda anyone who's
tried these headphones will know that
they are a solid can they are very
revealing
especially for a mid-range speaker and
their strong point is quite simply
they're lower and mid range sound detail
which is good in my opinion for voice
work and easy listening the attached
v-moda microphone is also excellent for
a $30 add-on which is what makes this
headphone
essentially now a headset the void Pro
RGB however has emulated 7.1 Dolby
Surround that turns on if you hold the
volume button for 2 seconds it is off by
default though when turned on it does
make a very cool experience for RGB
players and has the pure direct flat EQ
straight out of the box as the both of
the V Motors 2.0 analogs from the source
and honestly I thought that the software
emulation with 7.1 Dolby Surround turned
off definitely added to the 3d imaging
quite considerably especially for a
closed back headset it was one of the
only times that a software
implementation has helped with
exaggerating sound either higher or
lower within a headphone dynamic range
what this means is that these will do a
very good job for positioning enemies in
games though what about the bass the
bass well it was quite tight and strong
although sub bass was quite weak and the
mids
seem to have a decent presence to those
voices were a little recessed though the
best point was that the treble was not
in any way invasive and was quite
underpowered in my opinion compared to
the mids and lows which is really good
thing for me personally since I'd like
to use gear like this for hours on end
and edgy treble does tend to wear my
ears down very quickly and overall
though of course the V motors didn't
reveal more detail in music however the
Void pros did perform really well in
cs:go and footsteps were incredibly easy
to hear positioning was quite simply
superb on this headset dare I even say
better than the V motors and as an
asking price of 99 USD I can't really
fault the sound too much especially
since it comes with a mic and is
Wireless oh and don't forget that RGB -
next up on the jury block was the Cougar
immersive pro and straightaway from the
get-go I could notice that signature
boost in treble and upon stalling the
software it did have an FPS v-shaped EQ
applied
however after turning it to balance mode
the brand edgy sound was still present
and this is quite common in gaming
headsets and it is there to make people
think that the speaker has more clarity
than it actually does and honestly after
you train your ears to hear this you do
get over it quite quickly the best
remedy of course is to EQ
treble out in software though a speakers
sound signature will always remain
regardless the emotion Pro sub bass was
definitely there if you like your
headphones too shaky which I personally
do like and bass was present though it
was a loose type of bass good for
listening to hip-hop though not good for
rock in my opinion and overall the sound
was decent though not as good as the
void Pro RGB or the V Motors the
immerser also has its own 7.1 emulation
called
XPS around however unlike the void this
sounded quite bad and just added a
massive reverb effect to the sound which
didn't help me in gaming at all they
laughter II cueing the headphones and
using them in csgo for example fragging
was okay but again not as good as the V
Motors or the void Pro and I'll quickly
point something out and that is that
although it might seem I'm being a
little bit harsh on both these headsets
I am keep in mind comparing them against
a mid-range audio file can so if you
want something that sounds much better
than a ten dollar Evie can for example
that sounds like someone's chucked a
donor over it then you will be happy
with either of these options there is no
distortion music sounds good on both
clarity is decent though I'm just going
a bit anal retentive to give people who
are looking for a specific sound a good
idea of what to expect if they would
have purchased either of these headsets
moving on however both have conveniently
located mics the void pros mic just
flips up and down and when flipped up it
will automatically mute itself and is
quite sturdy the Cougar immerses mic is
retractable and both have lighting to
indicate when the mic is muted or
switched on which is good to see that
the lighting serves a purpose rather
than just cosmetics so how do these mics
sound let's roll those tests Peter
pepper packed a pack of pickled peppers
and then flat packed them into a box
however this wasn't sufficient enough so
he packed him in a pipe and smoked him
Peter pepper then decided his flat
packing wasn't quite sufficient to sell
from his home so he went to the market
and unfortunately no one bought the
peppers there either so he then decided
to put them in the pipe and smoke them
Peter pepper then had one last final
attempt to salvage himself and it was at
this stage he said look I'm going to
pack the peppers inside the pipe and
then
sell the pipe and this is when he tasted
success so some that we talked about
gaming headsets and whether they are
worth it or not and of course what to
look out for now for sound quality the V
motors reveal more sound details than
both these headsets on display most
audiophile engineered can will and
should as they have generally more
expensive though they are not as
comfortable as the other two and after
two hours of use my ears do get a little
bit sore due to the tight clamping of
the V motors and if a gaming headset is
going to get it right in any one
department I think they should get it
right when it comes to comfort so kudos
to both Corsair and cougar for nailing
this department utility was also another
big plus easy controls for volume and
mic muting and in the case of the
Corsair headset it was Wireless two very
big plus if you are like me and need to
keep those noise levels down but need
mobility when you are testing and
benchmarking late at night and another
plus of both these headsets is that they
have their own ADC and DAC onboard that
built-in USB controllers so if you have
a laptop for example and have some
extremely high levels of noise from the
onboard audio ports then the included
USB DAC amp will do a decent job of
giving you better audio and fixing your
problems almost immediately so at $99
the void Pro RGB headset from Corsair
has it comfortable very easy to listen
to sound signature that is great for
gaming and I will definitely be using
this when I need to move around and keep
noise down there definitely a keeper and
it's for the Cougar immersive pro the
biggest thing this has going for it is
it's big ear cups and comfort however it
does look a bit wacky on your head and I
wouldn't dare wear it outside unless I
was going to a Frankenstein cosplay
party though the immersive pro at 89 USD
has a sound signature that was bright
and loose one that I don't prefer
personally though the hip hop lovers
would probably like it and at 99
Australian dollars with GST it actually
is a very decent price if you're in
Australia and looking for something that
will gain well and is comfortable
so Cougars are doing a pretty good job
of getting prices right for all these I
actually think it's even better than it
is in the states in Triple P terms that
when we contrast that to the Corsair
Void pro RGB the pricing was very
off for Aziz there was 99 USD that want
to check the spec sheet it said 219
Australian dollars I was really left
dumbfounded here that is just simply too
much of a difference if you guys are in
Australian you want to buy the Corsair
Pro G be void just go to Amazon and buy
it and you'll probably end up saving
around $80 even shipped to your door and
also some last-minute things before I
get on out of here on the void you get a
wireless USB stick for the audio and a
cable to charge the headphones
themselves the included Q software
allows you to change the RGB lighting
and also EQ the sound too and for the
immersive pro you get that option as
well the immerser also has the option to
be plugged into a smart phone too so it
does have quite a bit of utility at its
disposal anyway guys if you enjoy
today's comparison slash review then be
sure to hit that like button and let me
know in the comment section below what
speakers are you currently using on your
desk or on your ears love reading your
comments as always and also my Vegas
sample just rocked up too so I'm going
to get on out of here and start testing
that and I'll catch you guys in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
bye
today we have a new head
from corset the RG might devoid RGB the
void Pro RGB the void Pro RGB void an
image a NEMA diameter with an inner
inner inner with an inner diameter and
you stop typing so loud too
