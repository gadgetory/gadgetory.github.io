build for $70 well I've got the answer
for you guys that is a $70 csgo potato
welcome back to Jackie our city this is
Brian coming to you guys today with
another used PC build this time around
this build came about because I actually
failed with a build that was pretty
similar in that I couldn't overclock it
as much as I could have because of the
ddr2 memory which was only 667 megahertz
so I decided to use that cheap memory
and put it in something of a similar
build that was much cheaper and didn't
really support overclocking and see what
I can build on a real strict budget so
let's go over the parts and the prices
of these parts and then we'll move over
to the build
you
you
dunno
so it's now for the time for the moment
of truth so we're going to try and boot
this bad boy up and see if we can get a
signal out of one potato two potato
three potato four but I'm pretty sure it
works because I actually tested the
motherboard at the at the store already
so kind of cheated this time so yeah its
booting up here and it's booting into I
don't know what language this is but
anyway looks like it's French or
something so it's working so we're going
to install the new boss now and then
we're going to see if we can get
counter-strike on here so everything is
being recognized this is great news
you
so there we have it guys the $70 csgo
potato was playing the game absolutely
fine in my opinion though it was a far
cry from all the other used PC builds
that I've done especially the $327 PC
which had a better CPU and a much better
GPU another thing to keep in mind with
this build was the hard drive is a
soldered gen one hard drive so it is
very slow when it comes to things like
load times and loading the OS another
thing too as the overclocks were very
limited especially because of that ddr2
667 megahertz memory though the CPU was
still kicking it especially for its age
and it did manage to get up and boogie
in csgo which impressed me a lot and we
did get some decent frame rates so I can
recommend this build if you are on a
strict budget that is the LGA 771 CPU
modded to an LGA 775 board now if you
want to do a mod like this I'll put the
link in the description below and it's
not too hard though you have to be very
careful and you have to have some pretty
precise tools so anyway guys that's
about it for today if you have any
questions about the csgo potatoes and be
sure to drop a comment the comment
section below and be sure to plug that
thumbs up button I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon and also
don't forget to subscribe because more
builds like this will be coming your way
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
