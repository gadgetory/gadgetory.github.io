we're gonna go pick up some really good
deals and see what we've got I mean
there's a heap of different deals this
month later on in the month I will be
doing a parts hunt in Italy too so stay
tuned for that but I have heard bad
rumors about Italy and if we do fail
there at least we've got some deals now
to account for that but let's hit the
road
and see what this first package is all
about
- here are the cards on the desk here
this is the 1080 T eyes we've got three
of them the EVGA models as well so
really good we've also got a 1070 Strix
as well so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna put these cards now on the bench
and see their temperatures because
they've been mined on and then we're
gonna give them a bit of tech yes lovin
and see their temperatures afterwards
now another really good thing is - is it
still got like warrants yeah I think
like almost two years warranty on them
so that's a good thing if you're buying
an ex used winding card for very cheap
you can get yourself a deal and balance
out all those bad prices that we saw in
the past
three
so we've now finished four different
tests I decided to test the other two
EVGA cards and one of them was going up
to around 66 67 degrees I believe this
was 60% fan speeds and I did this after
to benchmark runs in Unigine heaven so
after we did the apply the thermal paste
and clean them all up the Strix saw a
three degree drop and then one of these
cards stayed virtually the same and then
one of them had around a 767 degree drop
and then the other had just a couple of
degrees so there's a results but keep in
mind one thing to keep in mind with
these cards is that at least when I did
my mining rig back in the past some of
the data that I collected was that EVGA
is Zeus and also gal axe cards are
really good they're some of the best so
even the thermal paste they put out of
the box is pretty good you saw one of
these cards may have lost its viscosity
on the thermal paste but that's only one
and that was probably in the middle I'm
guessing these cards here so it's
probably getting that hot but other than
that these cards are now running
absolutely fine they've been fully tech
yes loved and now they're good to go but
also some other real good news is here I
picked up a GTX 780 for 120 Australian
dollars which I think we like 90 USD
this is almost brand new it looks really
good behind that is another GTX 760 2
gigabyte model we got this for 17
straight dollars so some really good
deals to be had in this current
situation where I believe FPGA mining is
taking over and those some of those
asset resistant currencies is the latest
news I've heard so you can expect a lot
of cheap graphics cards to come well
with that in mind let's move over now to
a conclusion and here we are finally
going to answer that question of should
you buy a mind graphics card one that's
bin weight that doesn't make any sense
should you buy a graphics card that's
been used on a mining test bench and
that really depends I mean these cards
here today they weren't that dirty when
I inspected them closely they really
didn't look like that
been used a whole lot if you go and see
a mining test set up before you buy the
cards and they look really shot then
maybe you want to think about twice
before you hand over your money that's
one thing you may wish to do I saw these
cards before I bought them and they all
look really good they even come with the
receipts and they've still got another
two years warranty and that's another
thing if you want to buy one of these
cards you want to make sure you get a
real good deal then of course make sure
the price is right and not only that
make sure it's one of those higher tier
cards as I said before when it comes to
graphics cards there's generally three
brands I turn to and that's Galax azuz
and EVGA they're really good cards as
you saw with the before and after
temperatures with GC extreme it didn't
make a huge difference and that's even
when these cards have been on a mining
setup so it's a really good deal if you
can get it when the price is right and
that's what we did here today picked up
three 1080p is also a gtx 1070 and then
of course later on picked up a gtx 780
and also gtx 760 so it's starting to
rain graphics cards again if you guys
are deal hunters get your wallets ready
or if you know a friend who wants to
build a gaming pc on the cheap it's
always good to have you wallets ready
wait for them miners to start selling up
because another thing as well is a
algorithm called eques hash has
apparently been cracked now by FPGAs and
that's apparently field-programmable
gritter ways from the top of my memory
and essentially they're in between an
asset and a graphics card in terms of
their maximum potential and essentially
that will get a lot more hash rates then
a graphics card otherwise would for a
specific task and in this case mining a
cui hash so the asset community is maybe
a sycamore but it's not FPGA immune and
so you're seeing these cards come in and
they're making GPUs useless so a lot of
miners are gonna be selling off their
Nvidia cards now so get ready for that
too and always pick up a deal when the
price is right that's my recommendation
but also check the cards out too as well
make sure they go warranty if you want
to be super safe and I hope you guys
enjoyed this one if you did then be sure
to hit that like button let me know in
the comment section below if you haven't
questions about xmind cards I'm okay
picking them up it's the price is right
you know me a deal's a deal and I'll
catch you guys another tech video very
soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
