am coming to you guys live from this
event and we've already announced the
winners here so the winners were number
one NCIX they came in with their pc and
a figure that featured two gtx 1080s and
a 69 50x will get another there's ad
from texas absolute ball or two and we
got number two we go on origin their
origin pc they came in second place and
then third place we had digital storm so
to be honest every pc here was an
absolute winner i mean they're just
jacked out to the max so NM from here on
i'm going to do an interview from all
the people who made these pcs tell you
guys a little bit about the specs and
what inspired the builds also as well
we've got the winners of the pcs which
i'll quickly announced for you guys so
for the velocity micro pc we had Zeya
bose malphas he won that and then for
the main gear pc we had dragon ops z and
then for the cyberpowerpc we had 0 and
then for the avid direct bc we had cast
valve and then for the digital storm pc
the winner was Jo faroole and then for
the origin bc they had missed the D&amp;amp;D 14
and then lastly for the NCIX pc they had
the legend Nova so I'll put all these
names in the description below for you
guys and also the winners so anyway
let's get on with these interviews so
here we are at the origin booth I am
joined by John how you doing yeah good
this ice noticed this amazing pc behind
me here this is a full sized ATX our
case yeah yes yeah it's our own custom
design case it's our pride and joy I say
I'm what are we talking with the specs
here on this bad boy so we actually have
two systems and one on this system you
have the gaming side for full HD gaming
no compromise late and see nothing and
on the other side we actually have a
streaming system for all full HD capture
yeah so that's from the DL God ok HD
cabbage God's yet on the streaming side
there's dual HD 60 parallel gatos for
full HD capture on the game as well as
full HD capture for the webcam you have
a 6700 k running on the Maximus 8 gene
motherboard 16 gigabytes of 26
66 Origin PC Brandon memory powered by
hyperx and on the gaming side you
actually have a 69 50 X on a asus
rampage 5 extreme motherboard you have
32 gigabytes of 2666 megahertz memory
also powered by hyperx you have dual
1080s and sli and actually both sides
have intel ssds one has the 730 series
and the other ones the intel 754 under
gigabyte pcie Andrea mean hard drive I
way pretty much fitting to pcs in one
case here and one's dedicated to the
streaming side of things yelled is just
dedicated to obliterating everything
else yes absolutely that's pretty
awesome from origin pc they've done a
great job here i hope you guys win and
all the best see you next time so we are
back now at the cyberpowerpc spot in
town here on the intel rig challenge and
I'm joined by Nam how you don't man
you're good and so what is this here we
have like I pretty much a transformer
style pc in the background here i am
just completely blown away by this thing
can you tell us a little bit more about
it yeah this is our luck series of
computers basically it's one of our
shares where you could customize
anything hard liquid cooling the max the
extreme anything you want we can build
it from scratch I can see here like we
got the on the b-roll we had this thing
just transforming before that was
incredible I've never seen something
like that come out of a pc before and
what are we talking about specs wise on
this species this one's got the Intel i7
core extreme processor the 69 50 X and
it's also got two gtx 1080s as well as
the 750d pcie hard drive wow so what's
all going to 10 core in this thing we
also joke and chew GTX 1080s I mean this
thing will not just play games fellas it
will grab the game twist it upside down
rip it apart and give you amazing
experience yep totally I mean this is
the most extreme you can get it's got
the top notch hardware that you can find
in the market today I see that the GPUs
are running on water blocks as well so
what's the max temps you have you
benchmark this thing yet oh yeah we have
that mean on average we're getting
around like 30 degree but that's on load
yeah it's pretty low and right now you
could tell like it's just running really
slowly
you can even touch the graphics cards
they're not hot and they're playing over
there dhoom3 onyx unepic settings no
problems yeah I did touch it just barely
even warm that's incredible good job I
hope you guys win the tournament and
thanks for coming on na many things you
want to say to the viewers out there
nope other than check out cyber PIPC if
you want the best computers out there
yeah I think it's not just looks we've
obviously got the performance to go with
that as well thank you so here I am with
the main gear pc and i'm joined by ron
how you're doing I'm great how are you
how's your packs really good so far man
having an absolutely amazing time but i
noticed this pc just stood out
absolutely gorgeous pc from main gear
here i'm surprised that you guys didn't
win i mean even though in the top three
I was a little bit disappointed mrs.
with my personal favorite of the whole
intel rig challenge that's really
awesome thank you for that do you want
to talk a little bit about this PC and
what inspired it what's in this thing
and how it performs as well not just the
looks so from aspects and point it's got
a 69 50 x overclock 10 core processor
single 1080 and intel 750 nvme SSD 32
gigs of kingston memory but really what
sets it apart is our handcrafted a
hard-line liquid point so I'm system
like this literally takes I think 16 to
18 hours to put together there's over 60
fittings individually in the system it's
a shatter resistant PGG hard tubing what
we tried to do with this build was take
the enthusiast class system that you see
on like a forum where somebody spends
like six months building a pc and we
wanted to make that something that
somebody could buy so this has that
amazing attention to detail you'll
notice even inside see the cable combs
we cut those in house so we laser-cut
them ourselves and the reason we do that
is so we can color match the system so
we could like for example do white
cables and red cable combs even like the
blocks that we use so we use all EK for
the water cooling we use premium copper
core radiators so it's all that little
attention to detail I wish you could see
the back there's actually a separate
reservoir and pump in the back of the
system we do that for redundancy so if
one fails you're not screwed
so there you go guys they got back up
gear in case something fouls and in a
water-cooling build if you have
something fail especially with a tank or
process especially with some expensive
parts in there the only thing you want
to lose is the pump so that's a great
thing that they got a backup system in
there that's actually a really good idea
i noticed as well just the attention to
detail the actual cables themselves are
so finally combed as well that's
something you guys take pride in as well
just the final spec what we're known for
in the industry is that quality one of
the really things that i love is if you
go on our facebook page every build is a
customer system we don't take all these
beauty shots that we like perfect and
then then we shift somebody something
different we make sure everything is in
its place and you know you're paying a
premium to get a boutique system
honestly we're more expensive than
building it yourself but we want that to
be worth it finally my this would take a
lot of time for the average people to I
couldn't even build something like this
myself honestly it's our product
developers Sean and our builders are
amazing I'm always very impressed with
the work that they do anyway this is
just on another level the attention to
detail is insane and also what are we
talking about the over cloths and the
temperatures do you have any word on
that so it's going to run very cool I
mean you're never going to over 60
degrees 6950 X you're getting probably
roughly like four four point five
gigahertz you're limited by the hardware
not by what we're cooling what's more
important is that it's a hundred percent
silent so we're using a corsair power
supply that actually spins down and you
don't hear when it's on and then the the
fans were using such big radiators and
we're using high static pressure fans
that they barely spin and so you can't
hear it when it's not doing anything and
what its gaming you could barely hear it
there we go guys they've also got the
noise down there on the DLO they've also
got attempts the looks as well looks a
phenomenal on this pc so thanks for
coming out Ron and thanks for making the
pc the viewers i'm sure will love it
just like me i'm looking forward to
seeing more pcs out of you guys thanks
for coming on so here i am joined by
tamer from velocity micro how are you
man doing great how about yourself yeah
really good pax is awesome as always
well I don't know because I've never
been is my first time but I'm seeing the
velocity micro pc in the background here
what inspired this and what's in this
thing as well so you know our company is
known for doing hi
custom gaming computers servers that
sort of thing we always are known for
putting kind of a polished refined touch
on all of our pcs so we like to
introduce you know a liquid cooling
that's a little bit more elegant you
know only more for a classier type of
touch for a lot of people that have
another desktop or anything that's where
a thing as far as what's inside this
computer we've got the Intel Extreme 650
X it's actually overclocked to 4.5
gigahertz at a base clock at three
gigahertz we also sauron that 4.5 what
are we talking with the temperatures
there so we're actually getting about 19
degrees Celsius idling after you know
under full load anywhere from 45 to 50
degrees under folder so there we go
water cooling 4.5 gigs on a 10 core at
45 to 50 degrees that's damn impressive
yeah absolutely we got two GPUs we got
to duel 10 80s here with custom blocks
for liquid cooling going right into them
as well we also got the Intel Extreme 1
750 series 1 point 2 terabyte solid
state as well very very solid specs in
there this thing can handle anything you
throw at it now also on the GPUs what
are we talking with the temperatures are
nova clocks on that just on those we've
got them overclocked by about 200
megahertz on each one so each one's
running fire around 22 2300 temperatures
you probably get anywhere from 35 to 40
under load which is you know on air
they're typically around 75 to 80 so
it's a pretty good hbu foes thank you
guys if you want to check out velocity
micro 2 i'll put a description a link in
the description for you guys and thank
you tema for coming on and if you guys
are liking this event then be sure to
check out the next velocity micro pc
that's coming your way right so i'm here
a digital storm and i'm joined by robert
how are you man great great I'm doing
wonderful this massive pc with just
decked out specs caught my eye and i
definitely love what you guys are doing
here can you tell us a little bit more
about this pc sure thing we're running
two gtx 1080s in sli we have an intel i7
6950 x we can push that to over 4
gigahertz we have our event of three
chassis so this is all custom engineered
in-house we have a local metal shop to
us in fremont build these and it's
something that any customer can order
like now so it's not just one off for
this show this is something that anyone
could order at any time and it
definitely looks good that huge window
on the sides they're not only the front
but the rear side as well i think that
is that good
be a new trend coming into the pc case
is your thing I'm not entirely sure I
sure hope it is though because I mean
you've got all this beautiful wiring and
beautiful tech and you'll be a shame if
you couldn't show it off well definitely
with me when I built a pc the cable
management horrible so I kind of like
that no look on the back but definitely
with the cable management here I'm very
impressed with that the tubing as well
what is that it that's advice cubic it's
a plastic tubing acrylic tubing so you
know it's something it takes definitely
a lot of time a lot of time to work on
and but yeah it looks great very clean I
definitely must agree what are we
talking about the temperatures there on
the GPUs and the CPU I don't have any
temperatures right now running on the
system but it's probably not very much
more than ambient room temperature you
got so much liquid cooling even when the
systems are on load you can put your
hands across these fans here and like
the turret Estes I everything's just
super cool very quiet very cool loving
what you guys are doing a digital storm
yeah not too much just come by come by
our website check it out you know we're
always happy to talk to people and yeah
build people our dream rig and
congratulations to the winner of this pc
too and i'll catch you guys around so
I'm here at the avid direct a PC here no
one here is to be found so I can't do an
interview for this pc though I can talk
a little bit about it we got tempered
glass at the back of this PC and they've
also got two vertically mounted GTX
1080s so actually a very interesting
design I actually really like this PC
after looking at a pretty close up I
don't know any word on the temps haven't
interviewed anyone here but again it's
got that 6950 ex all the pcs do so those
10 cores are in there absolutely deck to
the rim and I think whoever won one of
these pcs is definitely going to be very
happy at this point in time so I'm
joined here by Charlie from NCIX now
these guys actually won the Intel rig
challenge so very nice build we got in
the background here can you tell us a
little bit as specs and what inspired it
yeah absolutely so the system is cut the
Avalanche so what inspired it is we
wanted to create something that was
unstoppable so we wanted to kind of
stick with the white theme if you take a
look inside to see a lot of blue tubing
kind of water white and blue to
symbolize and the snow the water kind of
theme the specs are built with a 69 50 x
intel overclocked processor
two gtx 1080s and sli and an entire 750
series 1 terabyte SSD and all of them
are water-cooled with our ntx custom
turbo hydraloop it tell us a little bit
out of temperatures and the overclocks
as well what kind of temperatures were
you getting on load and whatever stress
tests or games yeah so we've been we've
been able to overclock it up to about
4.8 4.9 gigahertz yeah yeah so it's been
it's been it's been a pretty phenomenal
I'm really hard to put it under load on
a regular gaming temperature gradient
has been steady I don't think we've ever
surpassed up to about 35 36 so it's it's
very steady it's right now they're not
even it's probably not even going up
past like fifty percent performance
running rainbow on ultra right now so
yeah what about the GPU overclocks and
temperatures there the GPU overclocked
sent temperatures are also we did we did
we put them in s align and we also test
them without us ally because a lot of a
lot of our rendering work has done
without SLI and we've been able to I
think a GTX 1080s we've been we can
actually I can check for you on the on
our website but we've been able to hit
about thirty forty percent additional
performance and we had to put in the ax
our first try actually blew out our
power in our inner facility yeah so we
had to swap out the power supply I'm
just in case it breaks again so damn
those high currents going through that
thing this thing couldn't handle it
initially but it looks like you look
vice is running perfectly fine there you
got the custom branding on what power
supply is that on which one of the
Corsair is say ax we basically a 1200 ax
1500 1500 so that's a lot of vamps like
120 something amsco about a 120 dan so
there we go we got it from NCIX
congratulations charlie on winning the
competition and definitely some hot
pieces coming out I never lead you NCIX
to be a custom pc builder though is that
something that's recent under you guys
or you guys always been building like
full-on custom pieces of water cooling
old Macs to the rim we've been focused
on it recently I think we've done a lot
of pre-built in the past but right now
we're really getting into the gaming and
custom and really high-end builds you
can check out our website online and we
have a lot of different selections and
custom heart tubing soft tubing options
are all
mobile as well well thanks for the
interview and I hope wish all the best
with the new bills to come sir so now
we're just wrapping up the event here at
the Intel rig challenge it's been an
awesome time here the PCs are absolutely
off the chain these things are just
expensive they're decked out they run
completely well I mean I was really
interested in that jewel PC one on the
left side one on the right side with
both the glassing showcasing both those
pieces that was actually really cool
busy behind me here the transformer that
was really awesome as well and of course
the main gear simplicity but awesome
cosmetics there those three pcs in my
opinion with my favorite pieces let me
know in the description below what were
your three favorite pieces of this
competition and if so why and why not so
look forward to your comments in the
comment section below if you guys like
this via please give it a thumbs up
that's it for now and I'll catch you in
the next tech video very soon peace out
for now Bay jacked out to the max thanks
brother for moving my tripod really
appreciate it man
