guys the heavily requested used parts
hunting and this month again we're going
on good old gam tree and I've been
requested to go full bogan this month so
I'm just gonna do exactly that however
leading up to this video I did go hunt
for some hard drives and I did find a
deal or thought so I thought it was and
that was five one terabyte hard drives
for a hundred Australian bucks around
about seventy-five US dollars and then
when I went to go look at him I found
out that they were really old like
2008-2009 and they'd been pulled out of
a servo and I'm like look this really
isn't even worth $100 and they said but
firm on the price so I just walked away
from the deal because hard drives guys I
don't know if you know but these are the
most failed parts that I have on hand
they're the first part that I find goes
faulty on me followed by DDR memory but
that aside though I really don't mind
buying new hard drives and putting them
into systems that I sell because the
main reason is you're gonna have a happy
client but also you're gonna have peace
of mind not knowing that things are
gonna go wrong in that PC and also with
the power supplies I am running dry and
power supplies and cases though the
Cougar deal that I pulled up in a
previous video that's really decent 469
Australian dollars you get a case and a
very good power supply actually tested
at 1080 TI with a fork or recently on
this power splay it did extremely well
there was no dips this thing was running
fine no cutouts though let's get on with
the hunt
so as I said in the intro guys this
month we're gonna be hunting for those
use gravis cards it's the main component
that I need as I already have those x58
motherboards already got a heap of ddr3
memory that was donated and also we can
get those x58 CPUs those zealand's
Holley Express for a really good price
so the first deal we got up here is a
GTX 780 now we tried getting this last
month and they denied the offer I put in
130 a strand dolls which is really fair
I think they came back at 140 but now
they've got urgent up on here so we're
gonna give it a call see if we can get
this for 130 Australian hey Daniel how
are you mate yeah I said I saw your ad
on gumtree
GTX 780 would you take 130 Australian
for it mate okay do you want to text us
your address and I'll come and pick her
up okay so I had to cut some of that
conversation off because Daniel actually
gave out his address on the phone but
we're gonna go pick that up in two hours
and that's success that's the first deal
first call first deal done so the next
deal will got up here is Rhys enormo I
believe this is the guy who has been
trying to sell his GTX 970 and was
telling me that a gents 60 was crap in
the previous episodes we did but a GTX
1060 is like one of the best cards in
terms of price performance not only from
Nvidia but actually out there at the
moment so it's a three gigabyte model
we're gonna try and offer a maybe a
hundred and ninety dollars and see if
he'll take that it is the Galaxy OC
Edition it's not too bad so let's give
this a call hey race here you go mate
yeah I saw you out on gumtree for a GTX
1060 yep
yeah you got 250 would you go any lower
mate
190
I can't cash and I can come pick her up
how much do you want for it a 50 um I'll
feel a little less but yeah one dollies
I just rather keep an eye put up the
system I was gonna attend Emily so yeah
I no worries mate yeah I just I got cash
and you know if you I could do 200 if
you clean on that okay no worries mate
thanks mate right okay so we possibly
got a deal on a ten sixty from Rhys I
don't think that was the same races last
time I just I don't think it was from
memory the voice sounded different but
anyway we'll see if that comes back
after we hunt for some more deals
so next people get up here now is the
gtx 770 and of course at 150 AUD it's
not a deal at all so we're gonna try and
go extremely low ball on this often
ninety strand dollars and see if we can
get it right so I think that this one
we're good to go
yeah you selling a GTX 770 yeah yeah
would you take 90 bucks for it they're
fairly old car that's all so I mean I
can put it to good use but yeah because
it's just so old they're out of warranty
there I mean yeah it's kind of like we
can I mean I'm just doing the rounds
today like I'm calling up yeah if you
want 90 bucks now come and pick it up no
problem so it's just I'm pretty strict
on classes Oh Joseph thanks Mary okay
bye and did you see there guys that's a
classical example of May sticking firm
with a price it's
he wants a hundred bucks I don't think a
770 is worth a hundred dollars not even
Australian it's worth about yeah be
about 75 USD I'm just prepared to pay
ninety and that's for me that's my
threshold not going over it so that's
what deal hunt is about guys don't give
in to those emotions this card there'll
be a deal that'll come up I've picked up
one in the past 490 I think even cheaper
so deals come around just be firm on
your prices so next deal we've got up
here is a GTX 780 Ti still a very
powerful card even to this date I think
they perform a little bit better than a
970 so with that you want to be coming
in at around 170 Australian possibly 160
but because they've got 250 will come in
at 170 and see if they'll take that as
it's still quite a decent deal at 170
bucks actually now we're gonna go 160
and just go even more bogan than we've
previously gone in the past
so now the next deal will get up here's
another gtx 780 and we just picked up
one for 130 bucks so we're gonna offer
them 130 bucks see if they'll take it
and also go caught off guard with that
phone call so I kind of couldn't just
change mid call to a bogan that'd be the
weirdest thing ever
hello hello how I saw your ad on gumtree
for a GTX 780 yeah is that still
available
oh okay so you've already sold it I was
going to offer you some cash for it so
you're not you're not selling it anymore
how much did you sell it for 110 I can
give you more 130
I'll shake a leg Diane no worries mate
just if you can't I just send me your
address and I'll come and pick it up
thanks Ali quite that was really awkward
okay because I usually don't start off a
phone call saying is it available so I
just try to get into the rhythm there
Ghazali seem very shy but then someone
offered him 110 he took 110 that's the
extremely low ball I thought my 130 was
pretty good so hopefully he gets back to
me and takes 130 apparently someone's
already gonna pick up this grab scar but
hey usually with deal hunting it's it's
usually not final until the cash is in
the hand as I found out what those gtx
690 s man i had to hustle for those so
next day we got up here is a gtx 960 and
there's no number to call unfortunately
so we're just gonna drop in an offer of
$100.00 and see if they'll accept that
because earlier this month there was a
960 up for sale and I was ready to go
buy it and go jump on it but someone
else sniped me on that deal so there's
some other guys on the Gold Coast now
and they're hustling those used deals as
well except the one guy who picked up
one of those six hard drives for $30.00
or how much whoever you got it for I
don't think you've got a good deal on
that one so next up here we've got an i7
2608 gigs of ram a 500 gigabyte hard
drive in HP case now I've already bought
off Matt before last month actually
bought the PC off him so I'm gonna give
him a call but I can't really do the
bogan accent because he's gonna know
it's me so I'll see if you take $200 for
this computer if not then so be it but
for 200 bucks I could probably whip
something up and do a really good build
with this and I am sort of banking on
the fact that it doesn't have a good
power supply so we would have to change
the power supply and possibly add in
another hard drive or maybe upgrade the
hard drive and then of course add in one
of these 7 80s and we've got a pretty
good gaming system for a good price
hey mate how are ya not much dude I see
you got an ad on gumtree here for an i7
2608 yeah yeah man I want as much you
you've got the goods I'll buy them on
bonds land the depend now there's the
thing we're gonna talk about price 200
cash 220 done done I'll come pick it up
it's a legend
yeah how you been David how about I
bring over a six-pack as well and we
just done deal I'll see you later
all right brother I'll see you soon bye
somebody talking us up a deal of course
I'm happy with 220 I'll be able to do
something work some magic with this PC
of course he just lives down the road
and it is a Sunday afternoon so after I
do all the rounds and pick up all these
PC paths then I wouldn't mind having to
sitting back and having a drink to be
honest so the last deal I'm pulling up
here is actually two different ads from
the same person actually looked at it in
my for reasons video that I recently
released on the channel and in total
it's 14 gigabytes of ddr3 memory it
would be around that 80 Australian he's
asking so I'm gonna give him a call and
see if he'll take 60 Australian for all
this memory is you're always gonna need
memory when you're doing a new or a used
PC build in this case and with ddr4
prices on the rise I think a lot more
people gonna be looking to build a new
system because ddr3 prices are much
better but what about ddr4 memory and
the prices and yes at the moment there
is just a stinking shortage it's crazy
apparently it's because Apple bought out
the whole production line of Samsung for
their new iPhones and with that of
course rising coffee like being
extremely competitive
you could probably expect more demand
for ddr4 especially around this time of
the year so it's just a perfect storm
really high prices with that short
supply though in time if the prices
remain high
of course factories will look at making
more factories or ramping up production
somehow because it's extremely lucrative
at the moment to be selling new ddr4
memory that's for sure with that prices
of ddr3 memory is still really good and
this in turn is going to drive I think
demand to these used systems with ddr3
memory though let's call this deal
anyway what are we waiting for
hey Mitch how are you good yeah I saw
you out on gumtree for a ddr3 memory
yeah do you still have both ads
available you got me good job good job
[Laughter]
yeah I know was in there so I'm just
doing the rounds today man I'm just
gonna be picking up paper different
parts so I've really scored a few deals
what's the lowest you'll go for 14
gigabytes the whole whole lot of it are
the eight gigs of the ddr3 mm hi cake so
I was gonna offer you 60 for the whole
lot and then come pick it up
yeah I mean they're not out the pricing
is all off in my head now well sound
done deal man I'm doing the rounds let
me know your head address and I'll pop
around brother and all uh yeah no tuned
it all up don't worry I'm doing the
rounds I'll probably grab a six-pack and
if you want to guess oh I'm ready well
I'm ready got like guy bought off last
month I'm buying another computer off
him so yeah I'm gonna have a drink with
him but yeah I have a stop I have one
drink and um yeah and turn your sister
my brother sure
don't ya alright so then you guys have
been waiting for it I know people in the
comments like I can't wait the day Brian
gets caught out Mitch just called us out
so that was a first for the channel and
he offered to give it for free in
exchange for tuning his x58 PC and I
love tuning x58 it's probably the
favorite out of all time ever not just
to overclock but also to use as well so
I'm gonna have a great fun time and go
pick up eight gigabytes of ddr3 memory
for doing so so that's it for the deals
the person with any Greece he got back
to me with the 1060 and he's offered me
a I said $200 is fine so 200 Australian
for a DT x10 six he's not too bad so
we'll go pick that up it is the Galaxy
Note C so it's not too bad
we'll go get that and we'll go get all
these other deals so let's get on with
it
so it's now the next day and last night
I did have a few beers and drinks and I
decided not to film really caught up
with both Mitch and Matt that were
awesome people who meet in real life
Matt already met before but he this time
he took me into his home and showed me
his whole setup and we just talked for
hours and hours about tech and more tech
it was really cool Matt's the network
administrator so I was really good to
get a different side of tech than just
the gaming and overclocking and stuff
like that and he's really into it too
like he showed me this really cool ESD
air blower that I'm actually gonna get
for when I'm cleaning PC parts because
that's how he reckons he got that
gigabyte motherboard in the previous
month part Hunt to look so clean like I
was shocked he reckons was just because
of his Blas I'm definitely gonna get one
of those and also Mitch when I went over
to his house to overclock he's x58
motherboard
it was AUD 3r i think was like the first
revision of this motherboard where it
only had four dimm slots which three
were triple-channel and then the other
one was like single channel I don't know
what was going on there but also the
BIOS on this motherboard was so finicky
it was so weird it caused a lot of
headaches we had this cpu running at 4.4
gigahertz stable and then we went to
boot it off because I noticed the
temperatures were a little bit different
and when you've got that it means maybe
the coolers not put on properly or the
thermal paste needs to be changed so we
turned it off change the thermal paste
around put the seed of the grease into
the cooler and then we went to boot it
up again and it started saying Windows
is crashing it needs to be repaired and
it can't be repaired and this is really
just a problem with the gigabyte BIOS
itself back in the x58 days you can have
a stable overclock and then it just
crashes and the settings go all crazy
and the weirdest thing was his previous
settings that he saved for a biased
profile which has been stable for six
months we even tried to boot those up
and they just kept crashing so we had to
reset the boss completely by taking the
CMOS battery out and then we started
overclocking again and we did get it
completely stable so he had the w 35 90
I think it is the Xeon with a qpi link
score of 1 and this will work on pretty
much any x58 motherboard but the bizarre
thing about this CPU was that it was
completely unlocked you could take this
CPU multiplier up to whatever so I don't
know if that was a
bug with the Gigabyte x58 motherboard in
just this particular cpu because I've
never seen that before you just take
this thing to kingdom come
and I was really surprised it was like
completely unlocked multiplied so never
seen that before it was really good to
catch up with Mitch but we eventually
got there and Mitch also gave us that a
gigabyte kit of memories for free so
thank you very much and then we got the
GTX 780 and that is the azuz model and
the weird thing was was that I did I was
shown the screenshot with the DX diag
with 4 gigabytes of vram so the initial
last month's ad wasn't a lie he was just
confused
but then I looked at the card and it was
a legit Zeus GTX 780 in really good
condition too so look forward to putting
that in a build and of course the PC
that Matt sold me the i7 2600
a GTX 1050 Ti now the GTX 1060 the guy
did get back to me but then we noticed
that we had a history of like messaging
each other last year like ages ago so he
might have freaked out because he said
yeah come get it and then he never text
me his address so that deal kind of just
fell through he's probably like hey I've
got my messages guy in the past and he's
like got this bogan accent it's really
weird but next month anyway next month
with the accents I'm changing it up guys
so be prepared for that but now with
Matt's computer it's got a 320 watt
power supply so I'm figuring with the i7
2600
and everything's good to go except for
the graphics card so what we're gonna do
is we're going to hunt for a gtx 1050 TI
and now here's the crazy thing someone
on gumtree
30 minutes ago just listed a 1050 Ti for
a gigabyte overclocked model so I gave
him a call I just said look I'm happy to
pay the 120 Australian I'm gonna come
pick it up straightaway and he's agreed
to that so he's up in Tweed Heads it's
not too far of a drive and that's gonna
be awesome that's like around about 90
USD for a 1050 TI for gigabyte model
that's insanely good so I'm not even
gonna try and bargain with that deal
because if someone comes in between the
time that now and then I go pick it up
if someone comes in with a better offer
he's go fizz he gonna take the better
offer so I'm just gonna offer him the
full price 120 and he's gonna be like
yeah someone's come to pick it up so
that's gonna be awesome because that's
going to go straight into
the i7 built so I'm a little bit devil
again didn't get the 1060 the 1050 Ti is
gonna make for an awesome build
so I just got back now from another hunt
I went out and saw that 1050 Ti and on
the way I quickly stopped off because I
had to put the navigation in my phone
and then I called him and just said
would you take 110 because it was about
30 kilometers away $10 in gas and he
said yes 110 of Stran dollars for a GTX
1050 Ti so that'd be about 80 USD that's
pretty damn crazy good deal especially
since it's going to be perfect it's like
God came in today and said Brian this
2600 i7 rig and this 1050 T I was just
meant to be so this is gonna be like the
easiest and laziest PC of the month that
is going to come together and it's gonna
be really good price performance still
so that was a really cool deal and then
while I was on the road Ali the guy from
yesterday called me up well he didn't
call me up he sent me a text message and
he simply asked me are you still
interested in getting the GTX 780 and I
kind of thought at that stage well I'm
kind of in a position of power now
because yesterday I was gonna pick it up
for 130 you never go back to me so I
just said look will you take 120 cash
Australian so that'd be like 90 USD for
one of these and he said sure this is
the classified - it's a really big card
really beefy so that's gonna be awesome
as well on the build so today we picked
up three I mean today and yesterday we
picked up three graphics cards two GTX
780 s a gtx 750ti
an i7 complete kitted out rig - the
graphics card and a gigabytes extra of
ddr3 memory all this for 580 Australian
dollars so that's like around about four
hundred and something USD so that's
crazy good bargains I'm just stoked
right now because I thought this month
at the start of the video I thought you
know making this video I thought it
wasn't going to be a good month I just
thought the deals weren't really there
but as time went on the deals are just
there and people are accepting kind of
these lowball offers and also to the guy
who offered 110 for this card I gotta
say man you're a ballsy bargain hunter
like you've got yeah some balls but you
know I did pick it up over you
so you're pretty good though you got
some game I'm guessing you're the same
guy who picked up that gtx 960 4
gigabyte though I got the 1050 Ti it's
game on I know there's someone out there
on the Gold Coast who's hunting them
deals as well show yourself in the
comments so I was actually going to test
these two graphs guys out in this case
behind me however it's updating to
Windows 10 for creators update at the
moment and if you turn it off I think
you break the update and you have to
restart it again and taking so long
because my internet is so bad but
January 1st I will be getting NBN so
that's like much better in it and what
I've got now like 10 times the speeds 40
times the speeds on the uploads so I
can't wait for that I've already pre
booked my internet connection but in the
meantime I don't have to test these two
grams cards out on my main PC and also
this PC here you probably wondering it's
just the Banger that I'm putting
together I'm gonna sell it and raise
some funds for the channel
so we just got done testing the GTX 780
classifier that worked perfectly fine
and also the GTX 1050 Tia that we bought
that was working as expected though the
question remains is will the 1050 TI
work in the HP i7 2600 reg with no
problems we'll be able to use that power
supply that's already included so we
don't have to change anything out let's
find out right now but also on that note
I will need to add in a two ciders to
one PCIe connector you can get these off
eBay for literally I think a dollar I've
stocked up on heaps of them because I
use them a lot and they've essentially
got two-sided to 1/8 pin or 6 min you
get the choice so in this case going to
need the 6 pin but let's try it out and
see if we can get a boot signal
whoo
we now have a rig that is so easy to put
together we just added in a 1050 TI and
that is profit right there that's
winning so that was like the easiest PC
of the month that's gonna hit the
channel we're gonna see how this thing
performs in games but it's gonna be
really good especially for the money so
$110 graphics card AUD $220 system
that's three hundred and thirty
Australian dollars for an i7 2650 Ti I
mean that's just crazy they'd be like
what 200 and something USD insane value
for money this month has just been epic
the whole was really good all the parts
were really good also big thanks to
Mitch and Matt you guys are awesome look
forward to having another drink with you
guys again
and if you like this video then be sure
to hit that like button and let me know
in the comment section below what was
your favorite deal of today there was
some pretty juicy deals and of course I
think the combo of that 2600 and that
1050 t I really did make for an epic
video today and also on that note I
noticed Linus tech tips uploaded his
scrap yard walls and I dropped a comment
and thank you guys so much for all the
positive replies as opposed to
challenging Linus and Luke my offers
always out there for scrap yard Wars so
it's up to them to accept the challenge
if they want to sort of make an epic
show for you guys anyway I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon peace
out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
