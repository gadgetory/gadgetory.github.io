that's it doesn't none of our men
mental health ladies and gentlemen
mental health it is so important for
everyday life the healthier this is up
here the better your diet and the
healthier your exercise schedule the
better you're gonna become to combine
these three things together just like
that old Nintendo game
the Triforce you have the three
triangles come together to make the
bigger triangle this is what this video
series is intending to do and that's
help you achieve a better standard and
quality of life so if you haven't
already I implore you to check out part
1 and part 2 of how I exercise and also
how I eat every day and I'm not perfect
by any means but I do have a lot of
energy to cut videos day in day out on
YouTube and still have a very good smile
on your face so today we're gonna touch
base on a topic of mental health now I
get it before we get into this video
there are some people out there who are
just sol and there's certain things that
have happened certain physical
disabilities certain mental disabilities
they just prevent them from being a
hundred percent that prevent them being
what they could have been but either way
hopefully you can gain something useful
out of today's video but before we do
get on with this video I will say that
I'm an absolute nobody when it comes to
diagnosing any problems like this
disclaimer alert I have no
qualifications this is the personal
guide of me talking about my experience
with what I've encountered during my
life and how I've beaded how I've
overcome it except I'm not like dad man
because he's on another level truth has
a dad man has beaten diabetes with his
mind
you know stoic knows with diabetes but
I've been hit with my mental power
anyhow on to some statistics here with
mental health and brain energy in the
last 12 months 1 in 5 Australians have
experienced some sort of mental disorder
with the most prevalent being that of
anxiety so today we're gonna talk about
anxiety and how I overcome it also
nearly 50% of Australians have some time
during their life experience some sort
of mental disorder but all that aside
all mental disorders and also all your
happiness joy and good times and also a
lot of your energy comes from this here
the brain
in itself uses around about twenty
percent of your daily intake of energy
which in equivalent they say a human
uses about a hundred watts and the brain
itself uses 20 watts but also the rain
itself tissue for tissue uses up over
ten times more per gram than any other
tissue in your body it is also so
important to the point where if it loses
blood for eight to ten seconds you will
lose consciousness then which is why if
you exercise and we can see one end of
the extreme where if you lose blood you
lose consciousness then there's the
other end of the extreme if everything's
really well-oiled then Bloods going to
be flowing through and your brain is
going to be at a hundred percent
capacity
so now we've got our exercise down pat
we've got our diet fixed up we're no
longer drinking sodas and sugary drinks
every day and we are finally on to
dealing with this right here sometimes
it can be a roller coaster ladies and
gentlemen I get it me when I wake up
some days I just feel like crap I don't
want to do anything I don't want to see
anyone which is another thing I just
because I'm pretty much introverted my
personality so when times like this come
along everyone coats with it differently
I just say me personally as a human
being I've got a natural cycle some
weeks I'll feel over the moon and then
some weeks I'll just feel a little bit
energy less a little bit down I guess
but it's not depression it's sort of
just the natural in my opinion human
cycle I don't think we were meant to be
happy 24 hours a day and so having some
good family and friends around you would
be the most important thing to do
straightaway and this is a big problem
because nowadays I hear a lot of III me
me me me me me me and when I hear people
and see people like that around me I try
to give them some help initially but
some of the times people just can't put
themselves in other people's shoes and
so I walk away from people like that I
don't have them in my life for me it's
sort of like UI UI UI with me usually
putting the first step forward and
thinking about the other person and when
you get those relationships and you get
into having friends and family that are
in your life like this your life is
gonna be so much better your life is
just gonna keep getting that much better
at least this is my personal experience
with it but of course we're gonna keep
on talking about this tangent of being
down and feeling sad or even feeling
depressed because it's important to note
that when you're happy you appreciate
being happy that much more because
you've been through the Downers because
you've been through the hard times the
sad time that all makes that happy
moment that happy time much more
appreciated and I mean for me personally
I've got a pretty happy life even though
it's very busy
I still enjoy myself as much as I can
and the weirdest thing is as I said
before with the introverted thing I
employ you guys to take a personality
test find out if you're introverted or
extroverted extroverted people generally
get energy out of being outside and
socializing people introverted people
generally gained their energy when
they're by themselves and they have
their alone time me personally I just
like to at least once a week
drop everything I'm doing maybe watch a
movie or play some video games and not
talk to anyone at all it's weird I know
but that's what my body needs it craves
it
I'm guessing on the other end of the
spectrum the extrovert needs to do this
to recharge if they've been watching too
many movies or they've been in an office
by themselves too much then they may be
losing it and they might just say look I
need to go out and have some social time
and satisfy that extroverted Ness that
resides within so you have to figure out
what you are and what your body and mind
crave from the get-go
once you find that out you're on the
step to a balance and that's what it's
all about the happy times are easy we're
not really going to talk about them
today too much because you're not really
conscious of hey I'm happy at the moment
no you're too busy enjoying the happy
times but when you're not enjoying
yourself that's when you start to get
conscious about it that's when the
disorders come about that's when the
anxieties come about however I'm here to
say it's all part of the balance you
have to learn to develop the discipline
to just accept these feelings and if you
can't cope with them then that's where
you need to figure out how to change
your lifestyle up to then cope with them
whether it's an exercise thing whether
it's a diet thing or whether it's a
situational thing whether there's some
other factors of play your job for
instance it sucks you hate your job you
are miserable at your job save up enough
money quit your job find something else
you've got that person in your life who
is just bringing you down all the time
guess what tell them take gtfo out of
your life trust me i ridded these people
out of my life a good 10 years ago never
spoken to them again and I've never been
happier
hey you clicked on this video I didn't
make it click on it and you asked me for
the tech yes health video this is how
I'm telling you to get that equilibrium
balance so we touched on writing down
things that you're anxious about things
that you may be depressed about also in
itself writing down your goals and
things you need to do sometimes having
too much on your mind will cause stress
will cause anxiety and it's actually
statistically proven that writing down
these things actually reduces anxiety
and therefore can in turn reduce stress
so if you haven't already at least
it's a week write down all the things
you need to do starting from a list of
the most important things to the least
important things and it may just help
you out that a little bit more also now
it's time to talk about the biggest
thing I think nowadays that's causing a
lot of problems that people don't talk
about and that is stress when our
ancestors were all monkeys jumping on
trees way back in the day they didn't
have any of these modern-day stresses
that we had they didn't have to wake up
out of bed at a certain time to go to
work they didn't have the worry about
paying a mortgage paying for the kids
tuition paying for food paying for
electricity bills paying for in and
they're paying for drugs these stresses
were never there there's only the stress
of having to get the next meal and stay
warm so whatever you do try to reduce
your stress me I try to make down a
schedule every single day I write down
things I need to get done and that's why
this health video in itself has been
delayed because I've got friends and
family that need my help I've got work
that's pushed this back to the point
where it's finally getting done now but
that's how I manage stress and I
organize and I prioritize things that I
have to do and also prioritize my
introverted miss and my alone time which
I do need otherwise I'll be losing them
so what's coming out of this in part 3
is that this here the mental health I
believe is a big factor on a few
different things first of all if you're
not exercising and you're not eating
properly you have to do those things you
have to give your brain the energy the
blood flowed all the factors that it
needs to be at a hundred percent second
of all figure out who you are as an
individual are you introverted or are
you extroverted are you somewhere in
between figure out a plan or a routine
that you can get into to satisfy your
natural inner unconscious needs of your
extrovert honest or introverted Ness
third thing of all you have really toxic
people or negative people in your life
that are just bringing you down or you
have a job that you just hate then you
have to figure out how you can change
this situation
I recommend on top of this sort of segue
in with the next point is making a list
of things that stress you out things you
need to get done and also things that
you need to fix is your job bad fix it
do you have toxic people in your life
get rid of them like don't do anything
to them dislike
like don't talk to him than just sort of
weed them out of your life or if they
can be helped Sean this three-part
series maybe I could help him number
four get that list and write down things
that are on your mind and also a plan on
how you can fix those things or what
you're going to do about them in other
words your goals and how you're going to
achieve them every week you need to be
doing this some people do it every day I
personally do it every week and I'm
doing just fine and then last of all is
not really a point I just want to let
you guys know my personal experience and
that is there's just a balance in life I
think you're not gonna feel happy 100%
of the time all the time if you are then
I'd love to meet this person please
comment in the comment section below I
think you'd have an amazing brain and if
you're a woman please let's have I wanna
have some happy babies but there's that
balance just remember when you're happy
just enjoy it that's what life's all
about getting to those good moments but
stop for a moment and say hey maybe I
appreciate those moments because of the
other side the yin and the yang don't
worry too much because it's only gonna
create its own problems in itself
anyway I hope you enjoyed today's part 3
of the tech yes health series if you did
then be sure to hit that like button let
me know in the comment section below if
you have any questions we're coming to
that today's video and I'll get back to
you as soon as I can and I'll catch you
in another tech video very soon because
the health videos have concluded peace
out for now bye
which is why I'm poor you to have a good
rectus sir exercise don't wreck yourself
listen I need someone to make a
teleportation device and take me back to
the eighties get back there quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
