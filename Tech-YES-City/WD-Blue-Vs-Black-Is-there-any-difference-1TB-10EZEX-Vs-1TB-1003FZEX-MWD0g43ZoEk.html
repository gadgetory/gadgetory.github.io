Western Digital
so I was in the market for a new hard
drive I came across the Western Digital
blue for $60 and then I came across the
Western Digital black for $80 and now
the difference is back in the day was
that the Western Digital black used to
have a significant performance advantage
over the blue it also used to have more
hardware on the drive and also used to
edit just still does come with that five
year warranty over the Blues two-year
warranty however when I got both these
drives in this is the 2012 edition this
is the 2013 edition I was shocked to
find that there was no difference
practically no difference between these
two drives physically I mean that weight
was virtually identical between both
drives and there was I think a different
they used a different soldiering mask on
the blue compared to the black and then
other than that they also they used I
guess in the top corner you can see
there's only one little physical
difference there so I mean physically
these things were exactly the same oh
and the black does get some extra
processor on the drive itself which
virtually makes no differences in the
tests however when we got across to the
test I was shocked
the Westerners evil blue that I have
here significantly outperform this
Western Digital black as we can see in
the ATO disk benchmark here the 8k
winner when it first started out with
the point 5 kilobyte transfer of reading
rights it was pretty much about the same
but when it got all the way up to 8
kilobits that's when things started to
get scary I mean the western edge of the
blue pulled away from the black by a lot
so this is the cheaper drive performing
better than the more expensive drive
from the same company now I started a
double check so I wanted to double check
this I used a s SSD just to confirm the
numbers and yes the reading rights on
the blue was significantly faster than
the blacks I mean we were talking 184
versus 160 on the actual reads and on
the writes is about 164 versus 140 I
mean I double-check this to I'd side of
the switch drive port side side switch
side reports even side of cables just to
make sure these numbers were concrete
and they were the Western legal blue was
indeed outperforming the Western Digital
black so I was like what is going on
here West
needle so in conclusion what can I say
about the Western Digital black it's
quite disappointing because in the past
the black like I said before has always
represented a better product whether it
be having better hardware or having
higher speeds but this time around with
the black it seems like all you're
paying for is pretty much a drive with
extra warranty and I mean for 33 percent
of the cost over a blue it's simply not
recommended at those prices I'm quite
disappointed with Western Digital
because I've always loved them I've
always had good experiences on Western
Digital drives over this time I feel a
little bit let down by the black
considering this just at nothing extra
as opposed to the blue also one thing to
note that both drums will whisper quiet
they'll really quiet drives the black
the one thing I did notice though was
that the black did run a little bit
cooler than the blue and I'm guessing
this is due to the fact that it just
wasn't running as fast as the blue so
yeah ultimately the blue was a better
Drive than the black so I'm quite
disappointed to say that where's my
little blacks are pretty much not going
to be getting recommended by me anymore
until they offer a better product over
the blue because this blue was
outperforming the black anyway the
failure rates again I'll say that as
well the failure rates out of the
factory are the same as well so if you
get a blue or black they're going to
have the same chance of failure out of
the factory so all you're getting is an
extra three-year warranty in some cases
a drive that will perform slower than
the cheaper variant anyway guys I hope
you enjoyed this video if you did please
