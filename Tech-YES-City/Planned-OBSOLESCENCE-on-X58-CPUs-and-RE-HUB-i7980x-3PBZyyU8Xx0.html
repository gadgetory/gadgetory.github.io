which is an old architecture
now dating back 10 years,
I've been doing these tests
over the last few years
where I compare them
against the newest CPUs,
and the older architecture
can definitely perform,
even 'til today's standards,
especially when you overclock the memory,
and the CPU's and the
motherboard's base clock.
However, I noticed something
a little bit disturbing
doing these recent tests,
and that is, in general,
my numbers were a bit lower
than I'm used to getting,
especially at 4.5 gigahertz
on the particular CPU that
I'm overclocking with,
and that was the X5660,
which, when you get it
to a certain clock speed,
will perform the same as an
X5675 or an i7-980, for example.
However, this is where the problem arises.
When I started crosschecking
some of my results,
back with the results
that I took in the past,
the numbers were lower, in
particular on Windows 10.
And when a viewer commented
about forced obsolescence
in my comments section,
and that comment got a lot of upvotes,
I decided to take a closer look.
And what I found was a
little bit disturbing.
Let's take a look.
- [Computer] Did you forget your password?
Why are you so happy?
- Because I've got LastPass.
Never forget another password again,
with today's video sponsor, LastPass.
It's free to use, and it
works on all popular browsers,
like Chrome and Firefox, and
it even works across Windows,
Linux, Mac, iOS, and Android.
So, if you find yourself like me,
and constantly across many
different websites and forums,
some of which you don't care about,
and most likely only
visit once in a blue moon,
then LastPass can autogenerate
a unique password for that site, save it,
and then even if you use
it in a different device,
as long as you have LastPass,
it will remember all those websites
and combinations for you.
Also, if you're a business,
and you share frequented sites,
then you can easily share a password
with other LastPass users
within the same company,
so you know exactly who
you have shared it with,
not to mention, they don't know
what that password
exactly used was either,
so if you don't feel like sharing anymore,
then you can simply cut them
off and not have to worry.
This service is completely
free to try out.
The link's in the description below.
Welcome back to Tech YES City,
and let's pop up some
of these results first.
Back when I was doing
this testing in Dota 2
on lowest settings with the 1080 Ti,
I was getting close to 230 FPS in Dota 2.
This time around,
I was actually getting
a lot lower FPS figures,
coming under that of 200 FPS.
And this time around,
I actually had even
slightly-higher overclocks,
and the Cinebench numbers were showing
that my overclocks were stable.
Another game that we
moved onto was CS: GO.
This also showed a drop in FPS.
And then moving over to GTA
V, this is also showed a drop,
with the same settings,
with the same graphics card.
I automatically knew
something was up here,
and this is on a fresh
install of Windows as well,
and I've even gone to
the lengths of disabling
both Spectre and Meltdown
registries in Windows 10.
However, moving over to Far
Cry Primal interestingly enough
showed similar results to my old results.
So, we were left at a
dilemma of, possibly,
some of these games have been patched
to have a performance hit
on older CPUs like Xeons.
So, I decided to do
even more investigating,
and this is when I kind of found something
that was really disturbing,
and that was OpenGL on Dota 2.
When I ran this on Windows 10,
it was getting around 200,
and sometimes under 200 FPS.
And then we decided to do
a fresh install of Linux,
and also on top of that,
we decided to reflash the
BIOS, and backdate it,
just in case any funny
buggers were occurring.
And sure enough, when we loaded up Dota 2,
we were getting around 240 FPS constant,
with the exact same conditions,
in the middle lane with Storm Spirit.
What this kind of means for me,
is that something definitely is going on
with Windows 10 and older CPUs,
and I don't think it's to the extent
of a massive performance
dip, for instance,
if one was to do forced obsolescence,
they wouldn't just do it in Cinebench,
because that would be too obvious.
But all the popular titles here
seem to be copping a performance hit.
And then we looked at
something like Far Cry Primal,
which practically no one plays anymore,
is not copping a performance hit.
I'm sitting here scratching my head,
and wonder why this is happening,
because for me personally,
I'm a big enthusiast of X58.
I'm a big enthusiast of
the old-school stuff,
especially when it comes to
tweaking it and overclocking it,
and especially showing people that
if they get a really good deal
on some of these older hardware,
they don't have to go out and buy
the latest and greatest stuff,
and they can get really
good value for money,
so I was really upset when
I came into these numbers.
And now, going forward from here,
I don't really know what to do about this,
because a lot of my channel is built up
on testing older hardware,
and a lot of the viewers out there,
I know you guys love
some of this older stuff.
And it's sad to see that this
is being afflicted upon X58,
and I hope this kind of
trend doesn't come onto X79,
which I'm actually just
about to start testing,
because we are finished up, essentially,
with the X58 tests on the RTX
2080 Ti and also the RTX 2070,
and now we're gonna be moving over
to the eight-core,
16-thread Xeon on the X79.
And the ironic thing, too,
is that in my main rig,
I actually use this X79 Xeon
for doing all my 4K video editing,
and everything else, gaming as well.
So, if it's getting a
forced-obsolescence performance hit,
then that is really concerning.
Also, throwing on top of this Dota 2 test,
we decided to test it also
on ultra settings at 1080p
and were noticing yet again
there was a performance difference,
both between the Linux
install of Dota 2 on OpenGL,
and also the Windows 10
OpenGL on ultra settings.
And the differences came out in this test,
and I feel that this is indeed
a direct apples-to-apples comparison,
because you're using the same API,
just on two different OSs.
Anyway, guys, going forwards from here,
let me know in the comments section below
what you think about this.
I mean, I'm, as I said before, I'm upset.
But also, today's video,
I really actually
intended it to be on X58,
and is it sort of on its way out.
And I guess we can talk about that,
but this kind of throws in
a curveball into the mix,
because I'm expecting the
results would've been higher,
had it not been for these nerfs
that have been afflicted upon
this CPU and its architecture.
Anyway, let's continue
with story time with X58.
When I was over in Italy
doing an event for AMD,
it was actually kind of a long time,
because I had to fly over to Europe.
I then saw a subscriber
who let me stay at his house in Austria,
and then I went over to Japan after that.
During that time, Hardware
Unboxed released a i7-980X video,
and after that our whole
Discord blew up, saying X58,
it's just crap, it's done,
you shouldn't be buying it.
I spoke to Steve behind
the scenes about this,
and his opinion is, it's 10 years old,
it's ready for the dumpster,
I pointed out that, hey,
I don't think you gave X58 the best chance
when you tested it.
He did test it with and
i7-980X, and at 4.4 gigahertz,
this CPU will perform exactly like a Xeon,
providing it's stable.
And I do put the emphasis on stable,
because when I looked
at the video closely,
and the first thing that
came to me immediately,
was the Elpida memory.
This is literally some of the
worst DDR3 memory you can use
on any motherboard that
supports DDR3 memory.
Essentially this company
went bankrupt in 2012,
and this came at a weird
time when memory makers
were essentially
flourishing in the industry.
I guess that speaks lengths
to that memory directly,
and the reason why this memory is bad,
is because it doesn't
have any XMP profiles
above the JEDEC standard.
And essentially, on X58, if
you're overclocking your memory,
you'd either really want XMP profiles,
or you have to spend a lot of time
tuning not just the CL timings,
but also all the sub-timings as well,
and essentially it does take a long time
to get a proper memory
overclock on this platform.
And you look at the
results, there's DDR3-1600,
on both the stock and
overclocked settings,
which indicates that
Steve did not overclock
his X58 motherboard via
a base clock overclock.
And when you do this,
you essentially overclock
the QPI frequency, too,
which is actually pretty crucial
to getting better performance,
especially when you overclock the CPU.
The second issue I noticed was
he was using a Gigabyte UD5
X58 motherboard.
Gigabyte in this era did have,
I guess, a problematic BIOS,
and so when you couple a problematic BIOS
with problematic memory,
I don't think you're gonna get
the most stable of overclocks
and you can see this in
the Battlefield 1 results.
Essentially with Steve's
i7-980X stock settings,
he's getting 130 average FPS,
and this is at 3.46
gigahertz on all cores,
which is where the i7-980X runs at.
When you overclock it to 4.4 gigahertz,
you should be getting roughly
over 20% in overclock performance,
and this does show in even
Steve's own Cinebench scores.
And then when we move over to
Battlefield 1 results again,
we can see that they're
only increasing 9%.
Now I did run the same tests
here at the studio, and indeed,
when I had stock settings
versus to overclocked settings,
I was getting a performance
boost of over 22%.
Of course, it just depends
on where you test in the map,
on what FPS you were gonna get exactly.
But on top of that, the Cinebench scores
also weren't that good
for a 4.4 gigahertz,
both on the single-threaded
and the multi-threaded score.
For instance, I was getting
around 1,000 points,
Steve was getting around 970.
The single-core performance
was higher on my end as well,
both even stock and overclocks, too.
So, essentially, in
Steve's Cinebench scores,
he was getting overclocks that
were scaling with performance
but when it came to Battlefield he wasn't,
which, as I said before,
indicates that Steve did
not have a stable overclock
when he was conducting these tests.
And also, another thing on top
of this with with that video,
was when the Ryzen CPUs were
being compared to the X58 CPU,
they were definitely using
some very good DDR4 memory,
which that alone can cost more
than a whole configuration
of X58, DDR3 memory, a
CPU, and a CPU cooler.
So, I guess in closing out,
people in the comments
were just making fun of me,
but not one person pointed out
the discrepancy in the results.
Two people did point out
the motherboard overclocks,
and also the DDR3, so
that was good to see.
But what it all comes to,
I didn't really wanna address
this, because I love Steve,
and I love what he does,
especially with new parts,
new graphics cards,
Ryzen CPUs, Intel CPUs,
he does phenomenal benchmarking,
and I feel like his results
are very accurate when
it comes to new parts.
I just feel like X58, and
architecture like this,
it does require a lot of
finesse, and comments like these,
when I get comments like
these coming into my channel,
they're really insulting towards me,
in that it makes me feel like, okay,
I don't know what I'm doing at all,
yet I've spent a lot
of time with X58, X79.
And the reason I still recommend
people go with X58 or
X79, or stuff like that,
is because a lot of the times
people will upgrade their systems,
and not care so much for their old stuff,
and they'll just essentially
give it away for next to nothing.
Recently on Discord someone
found a really good deal
on an X58 kit for about $40.
And so, from time to time,
you can get really good
deals on this old stuff.
I've always encouraged my viewers
to take advantage of that.
Of course, when it comes to
buying a motherboard of eBay,
I wouldn't recommend at all
to anyone, and I never have,
go pay $150 or $200 for an X58 board.
That's just not representing
price/performance at all.
But another reason that
I had taken a real liking
to things like X58 and X79,
is that overclocking
them was a lot of fun.
It required a lot more than
today's conventional overclock,
where you've got literally three settings,
whack in your XMP profiles,
up your CPU multiplier,
up your CPU core voltage,
and call it a day.
On these older architectures,
you really had to trial and error,
test a lot of different settings out,
and figure out a great balance of settings
that would get you a higher
overclock, and in the process,
I guess you learn to appreciate
older gear like this,
and what it can do,
especially when you see the
overclock percentage levels.
Sometimes with and X5650, for example,
you can take that thing
from 2.66 gigahertz
all the way up to 4.4, 4.5 gigahertz,
with the right motherboard.
That's like over a 40% overclock,
and this just incredible value for money.
But another thing, too,
when it came to me and Steve
talking on Skype about this,
he just seems to think that
the architecture is really old,
and essentially no one
should really buy it,
and that's his opinion.
And me, my opinion is, if
the right deal comes up,
you should definitely take the gamble.
It might be a lot of fun.
And that's where we
differ as tech reviewers.
He's not wrong, I mean, when
he says that it doesn't support
a USB3 out at the front,
it doesn't have PCI-e 3,
it doesn't have the new instruction sets,
he's right in that a lot of the times,
it doesn't have those new features.
But when it comes to me, I think, well,
a lot of people out there,
especially a lot of our audience,
they just love playing
games, they like extracting
the most value for
money out of their gear.
And so, if you are that person,
and you wanna couple it with
a mid-range graphics card,
then X58 has always been a good option,
and even to this date, it still is.
Anyway, guys, I hope you
enjoyed today's video.
If you did, then be sure
to hit that like button,
and also, let us know in
the comments section below,
do you think X58 is finished?
This is sort of like the last
video I wanted to make on it
before I move on now to X79,
and the eight-core 16-threaded Xeon.
I hope you have enjoyed the
recent videos surrounding X58,
and this is sort of like the finale.
Of course, I will follow it up,
if I, I guess, I get more
information on what's going on.
If Microsoft want to address
some of these concerns
with the Xeon CPUs running
slower on their OS,
then I'd love to hear what
they have to say about that,
but other than that, I don't
know how else to take it,
but possibly forced obsolescence,
as some of the viewers have
mentioned in the comments.
Anyway guys, I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon.
