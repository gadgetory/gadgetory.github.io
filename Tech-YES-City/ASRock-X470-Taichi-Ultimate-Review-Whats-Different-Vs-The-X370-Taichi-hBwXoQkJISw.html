second generation CPUs they came a new
generation wave of motherboards here on
the desk we have the x4 70 tachi
ultimate from asrock now you may be
wondering what is the difference between
this x4 70 and the x3 70 Taichi well
there's not a whole lot of differences
but we will go through the main chunk
and then talk about what this
motherboard has in particular to offer
for you and of course the first thing is
the aesthetic big change up between the
white and black theme X 370 and this one
here which features a lot of gunmetal
gray there's also the addition of what
as rock called polychrome RGB or aka
addressable RGB so you can plug in for
instance an ml 240 our RGB water cooler
from Coolermaster and you can sync that
up with your motherboard which you can
control within Windows itself all the
BIOS and there is a lot of different
modes to choose from as well as changing
things like the speed also some other
nitty gritties as well we have to get
out of the way USB 3.1 out and AMD's
licensed for store mi technology which
essentially enables you to get a 32
gigabyte nvme Drive for example or 64
gigabyte couple it with a two terabyte
hard drive and then you can use that
nvme storage as caching very similar to
intel's opportune technology however you
just need a license you don't need any
special device or hardware to make use
of this now the last major difference
actually there is another little one
I'll talk about that soon is in the
center of the motherboard not just has
the aesthetic change but they've also
included an MDOT two heatsink and when I
was testing this out this actually made
quite a sizable difference to the nvme
temperatures when I was running a stress
test for 10 minutes the actual nvme
probe sensor was recording 80 degrees
versus 66 degrees and when I used the
thermal imaging camera that showed a
massive 20 degree drop as well so this
shield is working properly
much like gigabyte and also azusa's
shields that I tested on their
motherboards I'm yet to see MS I release
a shield that actually works so I guess
we're waiting on them to do that but the
solutions here offered by asrock does
work exceptionally well and here up on
the table now with the x4 70 Taichi
ultimate is the last difference and it's
quite ironic because there's no fancy
audio branding on this motherboard
itself it's just literally the caps and
then a little shield over the top and a
little bit of RGB there but this is
where the Taichi ultimate really shocked
me
the onboard audio is literally as good
as a dedicated solution now so if you've
got a mid-range set of cans you'll
notice like absolutely no bass roll-off
I got from five Hertz and under there
was like a tiny bit I think was like 2
decibel drop in bass so if you're a sub
bass lover and you've got a good pair of
cans this motherboard will deliver a
phenomenal experience that frequency
response curve was literally just flat
the whole way through perfectly flat and
then also when it came to the crosstalk
feeders they were exceptional as well
however if you do go over a volume level
of 90 so if you're at volume level of 91
with this motherboard there will be
audio leaking over from the left channel
to the right channel so basically if
you've got a decent set of headphones
mid-range cans and you want the best
listening experience on this motherboard
then just keep your volume level at 90
or under otherwise there will be
crosstalk and that's where the channels
leak into each other so it is a little
bit of a weird problem one which
motherboard companies are addressing and
they are fixing however the mic end port
there's absolutely no noise at all I do
believe they're using a little bit of
noise suppression but I'll let you guys
take a quick listen even at a hundred
volume with plus 30 dB
so the audio is quite literally the best
I have seen yet for onboard audio so
it's a really good thing because every
year it just keeps getting better and
better as rock kudos for making the
onboard audio phenomenal the one gigabit
per second NIC solution that is an I
tube on one from Intel there's also the
acquainted ten gigabits per second NIC
solution testing the speeds that are
absolutely fine you've got USB 3 loaded
on the back of this thing six ports and
also a three point one type A and a type
C on the rear as well as 7.1 optical out
and your standard 5.1 analog out there's
also dual band wireless covering 2.4 and
5 gigahertz bends as well as the clear
CMOS button ps2 port and a HDMI 1.4 out
so things have changed in some areas
between this X 470 and the previous X
370 taichi however things that haven't
changed is the vrm design they're still
using a 12 + 4 phase vrm 4 phases
dedicated towards the system on chip 12
phases dedicated towards the cpu and for
those MOSFETs they're using Texas
Instruments next FETs these are rated at
40 amps maximum capacity so you can
imagine all the amount of amperage
you've got at your disposal as well as
putting 60 amp chokes and 12 K Nietzsche
con caps so really phenomenal vrm this
also expands over to the memory as well
dedicating two phases towards your ddr4
memory banks now for the memory I did
manage to clock my memory up to 36
hundred megahertz this is on the a
g.skill camo memory so this motherboard
is capable of providing very high speeds
depending of course on your CPU at your
IMC and of course your memory itself but
I will say this this motherboard will
not hold back air or water overclockers
in any way shape or form both on the CPU
and memory side of things however moving
on into the BIOS they haven't changed
things up again it looks exactly the
same as the previous X 370 bias as well
things like your fantastic tuning are
there and also things like changing your
system on chip load line calibration and
also saving profiles with these is also
available as well as updating your bias
on the fly if you have an internet
connection so now we're at conclusion
time and is the X force
70 Tai Chi ultimate a goodbye it comes
in at 299 us in Australia there's no
pricing at the moment I will update the
description when that comes available
but honestly this solution here is one
of someone who needs 10 gigabits Nick on
board as I've said in the past I do
recommend getting a standalone Tang
gigabits per second Nick's solution and
just adding that in as you upgrade your
motherboards through time I do believe
10 gigabits per second is going to stay
here for quite a while which leaves that
between a $70 difference between this
and the Tai Chi non ultimate and there's
not a whole lot of a difference there's
the power buttons there's the Taichi
versus Taichi ultimate branding as well
as the tangy bits per second next
solution at the back so they're the
three factors and is that worth $70 for
you me personally I would save the $70 I
would go with the Tai Chi which is
already phenomenally built from the
ground up however me being on a test
bench I can utilize the power and reset
buttons that is a handy feature but it's
not really going to be a selling point
for most people so pricing is pretty
good of course compared to the X 370 Tai
Chi that's currently 205 dollars on
Amazon so you're paying an extra $25 for
that store in my license you're also
getting the addressable RGB header the
m2 shield which works phenomenally well
and you're also getting better onboard
audio than the previous generation of X
370 so ultimately comes down in the case
of the Tai Chi with X 370 versus X 470
and are those differences worth it for
you for the extra $23 for me personally
yes however if you're coming from an X
370 motherboard you do not need to
upgrade at all to X 470 I mean you do
get improved and enhanced features but
your core CPU performance your core
memory performance isn't gonna change at
all coming from a Tai Chi X 372 or not
Tai Chi X 470 one thing I will also
point out as well the nvme slots one of
them the top slot here does go directly
to the CPU via PCI 3 the bottom one
however only goes to the chipset by a PC
a Gen 2 so I would like to see asrock
implement dual pcie 3.0 allowing for
nvme raid 0 on this motherboard as I
believe the 2700
is a great productivity CPU and raid0
nvme is definitely for productivity
anyway guys hope you enjoyed today's
video if you did then be sure to hit
that like button let me know in the
comment section below if you have any
questions about the x4 70 Taichi
ultimate or the Taichi nan ultimate and
I'll catch you in another tech video
very soon peace out for now bye
ooh fancy
and this time around they're just
calling the Tang gigabit NIC option
which is controllable from within do it
within doze Bay does this guy ever
breathe not at that outro man I don't
know what happened there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
