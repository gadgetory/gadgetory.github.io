around a tech yeah City there is a great
story and today I'm gonna be telling
that story of the GTX 690 s and why it's
taken me so long to start testing them
against the GTX 1080 Ti there is a
little bit of a backlog around this
story it's not just the fact that I have
tunnel vision but that is one factor
we'll talk about that a little bit later
here today there's also an array of
other things that go on behind the
channel that make making these videos
sometimes a thing that you just have to
backlog so strap on in grab a tub of tea
I'll grab a tub of beer or even pull up
a green hand gaming video whilst you're
watching this video if that's more your
thing and let's get this story told
welcome back to tech yes City this is
Brian coming to you guys today with that
video where things behind the scenes
here kind of get a little bit tricky
sometimes and as I spoke about in the
intro I am got this thinking where I can
only get one thing done at a time so the
story behind the GTX 690 s initially was
that I had them in that Zeus micro ATX
motherboard and it wouldn't detect the
Quad SLI just wouldn't work at all and
that's because the motherboard
inherently didn't select Quad SLI it
didn't have it from the get-go and now
back through time there wasn't many
boards that supported quite SLI was
actually more of a rarer feature when I
started looking at what motherboards
actually supported this because a lot of
the boards will only support up to three
way a lot of the times or even two way
and then they'll use that SLI
advertising and usually you can tell
four board supports Quad SLI because it
will have a lot of PCIe slots on board
but that's generally not an indicator of
it being fully compatible but anyway the
motherboard that I had for testing on I
put that out for sale and I was like
okay I think this computer will sell in
a couple of weeks and it actually sold
the same night I listed it and I was
like oh damn you know cuz me being you
know hustling for my money and actually
having every month I gotta get parts
hunting I've got to make money on the
side because YouTube advertising money
isn't that good at all as soon as a sale
comes up like that this guy came around
he paid the full asking price and I was
like damn I cannot turn that down I'd be
stupid to turn that down cuz usually you
get haggled down at least a couple of
hundred dollars this guy came around I
seen the PC loved it buying it and so
that motherboard the z97 ex that I had
that was gone and suddenly that was the
only board that would support GTX 690 s
in SLI which essentially the GTX 690
itself is a card that has two GPUs six
80s dies on board and so you've got Quad
SLI technically and so what I was
looking for was a motherboard that
supported Quad SLI and it actually it
was a little bit of a journey because of
course I don't want to overpay for
something with
one's asking you a ridiculous amount of
money and it started over the last
couple of months where it was like okay
I've got this motherboard I can buy but
I don't have the CPU for it or I've got
this CPU but I can't find the
motherboard for him this big back and
forth tug-of-war between trying to find
the right set up to support quite SLI
and then it just happened that I was
working on this C 370 here and that read
in the manual
support squad sli and i was just it was
at that moment I felt like an idiot I
was like okay I've had the solution here
all along and not only that it's
literally the best solution because
we've got the 8700 K in their clock to
five gigahertz and I thought well this
is the perfect solution but it wasn't
all bells and whistles because literally
right as I'm setting up my Nass and get
everything set up this motherboard here
a USB port died and all three of the
onboard necks they're all blown out so
I've got to do a lot of diagnosing with
that probably switching off all the USB
ports see if I get those necks back up
online but everything on that side died
even a solder port blew out as well
there's a really bizarre problem I've
got no idea why this happened and so I'm
left here trying to get my SLI to work
because it's only saying like two of the
four GPUs and it detected all gtx 690 s
in Windows it's listing them as four
cards and so it's seeing them it's just
not enabling me to put them in sli so I
went the boss changed heap of settings I
then took out my capture card I then
took out the Intel 10 gig NIC that I had
in the PCIe slots because I needed my
internet and I put in this old-school
2006 NIC that I picked up picked it up
absolute bargain I think they're off
like 5 bucks back in the day I even just
hacked it up to fit it in a bill because
I remember I had an Intel motherboard
from MSI and and lightning storm the NIC
blew out so I bought that as sort of
like a makeshift until I could get my
internet back up and running again so
yeah I've had that NIC all along it just
happened to be that I put that in the
top one speed slot and everything
started working
so that was really good news and when I
put that in and got me into networking I
could then get Quad SLI working so I was
home and host and now what you see
behind me is a computer now that's
downloading all the games so I have
already tested the firestrike scores the
GTX 690 s as crazy as this experiment is
going to be is actually pulling off an
extremely good synthetic score in 3d my
fire strikes so the max potential of
these graphics cards are only going to
be limited by either the driver or the
game support or the actual vram buffer
itself so it does have a 4 gigabyte vm
buffer on board but generally you got to
have that with sli and since you're
going Quad SLI you've got to put a
quarter of that eight gigabytes of total
VM available and yeah you're left with a
very big limit on all those cuda cores
and all that potential power however we
will be doing the testing and we'll be
testing out five games that do have Quad
SLI support and then I will be testing
that against the GTX 1080 Ti and so
we're gonna get to the bottom of it and
of course the fact is with these gtx 690
i did pick them up for a bargain so we
got them for under $300 Australian which
would be like 240 USD maybe 230 USD so
at that price we're gonna see what this
performance can pull off and what its
limitations are in the next video that
video be dropping tomorrow so stay tuned
for it but really when it comes down to
it the broken promise does have a story
and it's one that's sort of with me
personally being someone who knows all
these videos I promised in the past I
just have to find the time to get them
ready and it's actually funny because
with the GTX 690 s as well there's
another limitation that is only one of
the monitors will let me actually have
GTX 690 s working properly and that's
because they're at the back they've only
got DVI ports in like a mini DisplayPort
and how many display four it will only
support the higher resolutions of these
monitors behind me so there's lots of
troubleshooting going on as well and
that all takes time so I know this when
I do these projects that I promise
I kind of know that they're gonna take
time and of course with the other stuff
that I have to get done around here the
monthly part
Hunt's the new product reviews and all
the other videos I find myself having to
take time out to get these promises done
but with this new studio now I know that
backlog is gonna get fulfilled this is
that first video that for some reason a
lot of people have been requesting these
gtx 690 s get tested and they get tested
really fast so this got pushed up to the
top of the queue I know there's those
other videos and I know they're gonna
come so stay tuned for them I hope you
guys liked this video if you did then be
sure to hit that like button if you want
to see more storytelling like this then
be sure to drop a comma in the comment
section below and I'll catch you in
another tech video very soon peas now
for now bye damn that's the first video
I've done ever where I haven't started
or stopped and whatever
there's no bloopers today guys you're
out of luck no even the monitors stayed
on the whole time I didn't have to move
the mouse not even have to do that damn
must be because I'm drinking no coffee
see one week I've been without coffee
now
I quit coffee I'm not drinking anymore
just it's out of my life forever
not drinking another drop of coffee no
not doing it I know the consensus is you
have to drink coffee it's really good
for you but for some reason I drink it
and I feel like a zombie it any good for
me I'm stopping brothers I'm quitting
done not gonna stop drinking alcohol
though no that's good for you
also another thing came to mom I was
drinking tea and watching the green hand
gaming video we actually did say we
would collabing the future when this
studio was finished so Tim I hope you
can come up to the Gold Coast and we can
give the viewers the audience and epic
collaboration I just remember that then
let's get it done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
