how you can build your very own Windows
8 get own apps with flexibility ladies
and gentlemen welcome back to tech yet
city this is brian coming back to you
guys today with a little vlog sort of
detailing what i'm doing around my house
at the moment and recently i have a big
need for an ass and I thought well can I
do it with all the gear that I have here
and the answer is yes and it works very
well but if you guys want to do this at
your home what you will need is a
dedicated PC and then you'll also
obviously need that dedicated PC hooked
into a router on the network and also
I've got Windows 8 installed so it's
very easy to do it I didn't have to
reinstall anything I just chopped and
changed pcs but anyway that being said
let's get on with it so it's that time
in my life where I'm just finding myself
in need of a Nassau R a network attached
storage now the reason for this is that
I'm using my 5820k rig for editing and
gaming but the problem is is that I'm
just running out of space since games
are just so big nowadays like 50 gig and
install my SSDs are just running out of
space and I got no space for editing so
I'm going to be using the one terabyte
from upstairs on my rig there and using
that as a dedicated drive for games and
then pulling out that 2 terabyte from
this computer and putting it in my home
theater PC which is going to become my
new nass so there's a good thing about
this is that the one sitting on top is a
Pentium 3250 I think so as well I'm
going to be underclocking it under
vaulting it and so on idle it should use
next to no power may be I'm hoping for
like 20 watts maybe even less and the PC
under that since it wasn't getting used
that's going to become my new home
theater PC since you really don't need
much to run a home theater PC since it's
just running mp4s
so anyway let's get all this set up
and just like that our $40 PC is now the
new home theater PC so now we are going
to get on to this little bad boy here
and we're going to put it all the way
over here
I guess here's the final product it's
just two hard drives connected to a
hatch 81m mini ATX board with a 3250
with 4 gigabytes of ddr3 memory there so
we're just going to do some little bit
of advanced sharing on these drives and
put it on the homegroup and then we
shall also extremely biles
don't have a tripod mount on your webcam
well that's easily fixed ladies and
gentlemen with duct tape so at the end
of the day I now have a kick-ass nest
with three terabytes of storage also the
best thing about this is I can now
access files from upstairs
and copy them to the nest and easily
access the downstairs and vice versa so
very convenient and also the server
itself probably uses up around about 40
watts on idle or just in process and
when the hard drive switch off uses up a
little bit less as you saw there I was
under vaulting the CPU and the RAM to
save a bit more power since this thing
is always going to be on all the time
now and there's probably some questions
out there what about why didn't you use
Linux I just couldn't be bothered CBF I
guess that's just the Aussie and me I'm
sure Linux has very good options there
for nice solutions I just already had
Windows 8 on there so I just decided to
use that and it was very easy to do and
I'm sure there's a lot of people out
there who are very comfortable with
Windows 8 so I guess this guide is like
a Windows 8 flexible nass and it works
very well now there's also probably are
people wondering why didn't I use a raid
1 or raid 5 and now me personally I've
always been the type to just copy can't
live without files to two different
drives if I really need them also but as
it stands a lot of the files on those
drives I could live without if I lost
them so that's just about it for how I
backup things but I've usually got two
drives just running normally no need to
raid them that's just how I use my Nass
in a home environment so anyway guys
that's about it for today if you have
any questions then be sure to drop a
comment in the comment section below
and if you haven't already hit that like
button and subscribe to tech yes City if
you're not already subscribe and I'll be
coming back to you guys with more tech
news and use face out for now but that's
just so ghetto ghetto ghetto ghetto
