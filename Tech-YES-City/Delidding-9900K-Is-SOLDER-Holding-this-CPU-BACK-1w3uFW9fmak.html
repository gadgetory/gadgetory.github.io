the 9900 kay we're gonna be deleting it
testing our before and after
temperatures as well as giving it a much
better cooling than what we did in the
review if you look at the H 100 I Pro
all-in-one it's a pretty decent cooler
as it is but since the 9900 K demands
very good cooling we're gonna give it to
it because essentially this is what you
face with if you don't now I did try a 5
gigahertz overclock in this particular
instance and it's just met with a blue
screen of dip so I'm gonna be changing
it over first of all for the custom ek
water cooling solution then after that
we're gonna be deleting and checking out
the before and after temperatures for
you guys
are you in the market for a Z 390
motherboard that just packs nothing but
value will if you are the asrock phantom
gaming series has it all 12 phase power
design amazing onboard audio and also a
unique implementation of a NIC which is
2.5 gigabits per second prioritizing
your packets for your gaming needs links
in the description below if you want to
check out more so right here we've got
the ek I think it's its ek gaming fluid
gaming a 240 G so hopefully all things
considered if I have a 5 gigahertz
overclock versus a 5 gigahertz overlock
I'm hoping I just magically gain some
FPS because it says gaming on the box
but what we got here now is liquid
protocol laboratories this is the only
stuff I recommend for doing D lids with
on Intel CPU die to IHS contacts that's
me personally other people have their
own recommendations and stuff like that
but right now we're going to put this
whole thing together and then we are
going to take do some testing with
temperatures and then take it all apart
d lid the chip itself and then test the
before and after temperatures for you
guys
you really are you really risking it all
putting it all the line it's multiple
thousand dollar PC because you're that
confident with you Lou
aren't you see the amount of you fools I
exerted on this thing and get elite
embrace you bought this as a Corsair
keyboard a balance and the power supply
have a look again again I'll get you it
on camera so you put the pots on voice
doesn't leak wait I need paper towels
under this thing to take yes loop
doesn't leak
so now we've got the water cooler up
here we've got the voltage set in the
blasts manually at one point three five
volt leveled two LLC as well which is
quite a normal setting ax 1500 watt
power supply pretty much the best power
supply money can buy and we've got a now
custom water loop with its own external
reservoir and pump on a custom EK water
block and we're going to see now five
gigahertz at 11.35 volt let's hit that
start button let's have a look here
let's have these temperatures
okay that's a pretty good sign hasn't a
hasn't crashed yet but now we are
hitting about 90 degrees 91 and we've
only just started the tests so we're
gonna leave this for 10 minutes and then
way to come back to it and we're gonna
see how it's doing now these cpu V cool
here I'm pretty sure in i-264 there miss
reading I'm gonna try download some
other software and see if we get some
more accurate readings because they just
don't seem right I'm sure level 2 LLC is
not over vaulting 1.35 vol 2 1.42 but
anyway let's come back off to 10 minutes
of 5 gigahertz and recheck our
temperatures so so at this stage we've
got the better cooling arm we've tried
playing around the boss with various
settings to get this 5 gigahertz
I guess stable isn't the word because it
is passing the stress test absolutely
fine I've tried putting a fan on the vrm
there and the real issue here is we're
just getting like Cinebench schools that
are below that of stock settings and
this isn't right if your computer's not
running right it's gonna show in the
benchmarks ultimately so what I'm gonna
do now to get this 5 gigahertz
overclockers I'm gonna try and switch
over to the Zeus Maximus see if that
gives us some different numbers because
when I do this deal it a test I want
this to be a like rock solid 5 gigahertz
and then we can test lidded vs. deal it
attempts
okay so we're done over 20 minutes
testing here on the five gigahertz which
isn't I know it's not a hundred percent
stable because there's some kind of form
of throttling going on as we saw in
Cinebench scores when we tried this
earlier on the asrock board and what
we're gonna do now is we're gonna try
and deal with this CPU and then actually
put a liquid metal on it attempt to put
liquid metal on it and then see if of
course how much it affects the temps but
also if it helps sort of lift a ceiling
that I believe is currently on this CPU
because this cooler here is like not
even lukewarm I'll pull up the
thermal-imaging camera for you guys
quickly so you can see what's going on
so cool is definitely not the problem
this time around as before I thought it
might have been the H 100 right probe
but I still think these CPUs are just
getting too hot internally before they
can dissipate the heat even to the IHS
which can they go to the cooler but
let's deal it and find out
so we're now completed 20 minutes of
ITCC for stress test and the max
temperature we're getting here at 5
gigahertz is 91 degrees so 6 degrees
already lower than the non deleted chip
and the good news is is that the
temperatures are more evenly spread
across the cores here and the best news
is is that our Cinebench scores are now
running as they should be so this is
really good news because the d lid has
not only helped with the temperatures
but it's also helped us achieve a 5
gigahertz overclock that is super stable
at least from what we can tell so far so
I think it's time to move on to a
conclusion but I'm gonna do it in the
morning because I'm it's like yeah
literally like what 1:30 in the morning
so I need some sleep
so it's now morning time we have booted
up at five point one gigahertz now there
is a little problem here and that is
that the temperatures are fine like
they're still under a hundred degrees C
on all caused but we can see here that
we've got actual CPU throttling
occurring within either 64 so we're now
facing a predicament of temperatures
being okay and still under t.j.maxx
actually well with under the limit and
the Cinebench scores are actually
confirming this as well and this further
sort of validates what I was talking
about with the lower clocks and those
Cinebench schools that just didn't make
sense before so now we can finally move
over to a super solid conclusion and
there's the 9900 K at 5 gigahertz stable
finally and we saw some really good
center bench scores I did learn a little
bit more about the whole CPU itself
during this process and we did manage to
boot up at 5 point 2 gigahertz however
it was anything but stable Cinebench was
crashing we could start a stress test
but that was throttling almost
immediately but then we tried to work
this CPU at 5.1 gigahertz and it is
running stable I guess in height of 64
except for one weird thing as we saw
before the CPU was throttling and the
temperatures were still well within
t.j.maxx so as we looked at before when
we're having problems before the D LED
where we've got a stable 4.9 but we
couldn't get a stable 5 gigahertz we're
having the problem now we're gonna
stable 5 gigahertz but we can't get a
stable 5.1 and so we saw a temperature
drop as well of 6 degrees and so this is
what a deal it'd will do for you on the
9900 K it will allow you just to get
that little bit extra out of your CPU
however on the flip side I honestly
would not recommend this this time
around to anyone taking a razor blade to
your CPU is seriously not good at any
given moment one slip and a one mistake
and that CPUs bricked and it's a very
expensive mistake to make if you do it
but if you do decide to do this then
seriously take your time and be very
meticulous about it because as we said
before this is silicon we're now working
with the dye and I watched a Barry's
video he actually sands the
by down which is next level
meticulousness I mean that guy is nuts
when it comes to doing meticulous stuff
with things like CPUs if you haven't
already you can check out his video I'll
put the link in the description below
but in this regard it's for me
personally I wouldn't go anything
further than what I've done here today
deal ended it with device then I skimmed
off the solder using a razor and then
skimmed it off again then used an
alcohol wipe to wipe both sides of the
equation down and then put some Coolibar
towards liquid metal probe between the
dye and the IHS and yes we saw a solid
temperature drop and we also got an
extra 100 mega Hertz the last thing to
talk about is eks water cooling loop and
this did a phenomenal job of handling
the ninety nine hundred K and as I said
in the review if you're going with a
ninety nine hundred K and you want to
get some solid overclocks then
definitely go for something custom or
really high-end
the h108 pro it's a decent cooler but I
feel like for the ninety nine hundred K
it's just not up to the task when it
comes to overclocking out of the box
it'll handle it fine but as we saw this
custom loop it did a much better job and
it was able to lock in those overclocks
absolutely fine however I probably could
get to five point one stable possibly
even five point two if I grab this whole
set up and whack it underneath my aircon
I mean if that's something you guys want
to see in a separate video maybe even
get the RT X xx atti under there too
because there are some really cool
settings within the BIOS that we can
sort of tinker with to try and extract
even just a little bit more fps maybe
we'll take a look at that in that video
as well if you want to see it let me
know in the description below and also
let me know what you thought about
today's video if you liked it then be
sure to hit that like button and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon hope you enjoyed today's journey
sort of vlog tour of the D live process
and the before and after and I'll catch
you in the next one
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
