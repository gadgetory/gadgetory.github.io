delay between performing one action and
realizing results this is in my opinion
the biggest hurdle that will hold back
cloud gaming and cloud gaming has
recently made itself in major tech news
with Google set to roll out its stadia
service later this year in 2019 and
subsequently roll it out worldwide by
2021 using a combination of AMD GPUs and
Intel CPUs where if you haven't seen
that video already then I'll put the
link up here it does have the necessary
power to deliver smooth gameplay via the
cloud furthermore competitors that have
already had these services in place like
NVIDIA GeForce now for example which has
been in beta for six years and is
available only in North America and
Europe hasn't changed the market really
at all steam link was a piece of
hardware that steam tried to roll out in
2018 and it flopped quickly entering the
discontinued phase however they are
trying to reboot the service this time
without requiring the hardware though
the same issues that face stadia have
already faced steamin Nvidia and that is
is this what gamers really want I know
me personally I am very sensitive to
input delay and using something that
even has 50 milliseconds of delay on
'add will almost trigger me my whole
desktop is built up for low latency from
using a Logitech mouse to an overclocked
machine to a low latency monitor I just
don't like input lag
full-stop any second wasted especially
wasted in regards to staring at a blank
screen is the worst kind of waste
possible so in many ways part of me is
very curious to trial out this service
though as humans I feel like we have a
tendency to fall into what I call the
upgraders misfortune and by this I mean
once we experience something that is
faster and better pulling back to the
previous item that was slower and
inferior that we previously enjoyed no
longer has that same level of excitement
and joy simply because we experience
something better and superior I feel
like this in itself will be the biggest
phenomena holding Google Stadium back
and
whether or not they are ready to break
this barrier remains to be seen
current demonstrations have the input
lag with numbers showing that of roughly
90 milliseconds and I'm sure this is
Google's best case scenario being at a
showcase from Google themselves though
interestingly enough demos are now
coming out showing the mouse movement in
real time followed by the transition of
frames and you can clearly see a delay
forget accurately measuring it it's
obvious if you blatantly see it on a
YouTube demonstration video then it's
clearly there though on the flip side
one advantage is if we look at the
current multiplayer scape of gaming you
still have to connect to a server and
transmit the data back and forth if the
server and game streaming locations are
at the same location then it could mean
multiplayer gaming wouldn't be affected
anywhere near as much as single-player
could be though on the same token
sometimes multiplayer games a
client-side based rather than
server-side based in other words the
input latency feel is heavily mitigated
by reacting to actions and input
completed on the user's side
instantaneously digital foundry however
did an amazing video talking about the
specs and lanes itself I'll put the link
to that video up here if you haven't
seen it already so basically they had an
opportunity where they got a 240 FPS
camera and measured the latency based
off the delays they experienced on
Google pixels books using Google Stadium
and the response times in-game and they
found that was roughly and this is of
course rough science so it could be
quite a bit lower or higher based on
real-world rollout that the stadium
projected 166 milliseconds of total
input latency that's the total input lag
altogether with display monitor lag and
Wi-Fi included though the Wi-Fi was on a
200 megabits per second connection and
it shouldn't be adding much delay at all
this stacked up versus project streams
estimated 200 milliseconds with input
delay a PC running 30 FPS which is
horrible my dad at 133 milliseconds
verse a hundred milliseconds for 60 FPS
on PC versus Xbox 1x at 166 milliseconds
counting in roughly and monitor with 21
milliseconds input delay though the
figures that do confuse me a little here
is that I do my own in-house testing and
input lag during csgo testing for exam
with mouse actualization on a 1000 FPS
camera on the right setup can go as low
as 10 milliseconds for total system
input delay which for me personally in
many tech enthusiasts who play PC games
would show a massive difference if they
went from this to Google Stadium one
that could be quite hard to adopt other
issue brought up was of course since
it's a streaming technology the quality
of the graphics will be compressed
since the data will be transmitted by
the internet though initial impressions
have put it at having only a slight
reduction in quality that's barely
noticeable on the flipside a big benefit
of streaming with Google stadia is that
they can utilize what they call multi
GPU technology and not in the
traditional sense of SLI or crossfire
but more in the sense of using
additional GPUs when needed 3d mark
collaborated with stadia to release a
special demonstration that uses one GPU
for the classical geometry and
traditional rendering and then calls
upon another GPU when needed for further
complex simulations and rendering of
complex particles though actually the
biggest thing I took out of this demo
was that the fire guy finally won rock
on you know the poor guy finally got the
W as opposed the fire strike where he
lost so that take that Iceman though on
a serious note it could be a good
catalyst to push PC developers to better
utilize multi-gpu setups as we have seen
with gaming trends that PC gamers have
heavily moved back to single graphics
card gaming setups myself included
though regardless of the latency issues
there are many I openin opportunities
that stadia does present the biggest one
for me is cracking down on hackers
especially in FPS games where people
speed hack aimbot &amp;amp; wallhack I even
caught some of this footage in apex
legends of my teammate literally
teleporting around the map and winning
the game before I could even confront an
enemy a stopping online hacking puts
everyone at an even playing field which
is what online competitive multiplayer
gaming is supposed to be about though
all the benefits of course include
real-time co-op with your partners point
of view interactive and dynamic two-way
control in that you can instantly help
out your teammate if they allow you to
by controlling their character and it
does add to the level of immersiveness
very quickly and we
haven't even looked into VR capabilities
yet nor let alone this seamless
streaming integration with YouTube live
and the ability to join empty slots with
your favorite streamers if they allow
you to I believe they're also allowing
simultaneous streams sooo so you can
essentially play the same game and
character of two different people at two
different locations that would be weird
kind of like feeling what it would be
like to be an ogre Magi that's the ogre
with two heads on one body though anyway
lastly I think the best thing to
possibly come out of stadia would be the
opportunity and ability for those on a
low income to be able to actually stream
due to poor PC certifications where they
otherwise couldn't stream it could
essentially unearth the next best pro
gamer that could have never been so it
seems that Google is going all-in with
this service planning to roll it out
ultimately to over 200 countries plus
with the initial shots of the server
rooms showing massive investments in
this Hardware though one does have to
wonder lastly using that many Vega 56
reference models in one warehouse I
don't think it's a matter of if that
when will the building take off and
start flying around the world perhaps
even offering a flight home in stream
service Google stadia these
possibilities they're endless anyway
guys I hope you enjoyed today's video if
you did then be sure to hit that like
button and let us know in the comments
section below
what you think about the input delay and
the latency is it really going to affect
the gaming experience me personally I'm
very sort of weary of it I think the
first time I try this is gonna be
make-or-break I can't wait to try it
honestly I think it's so like
revolutionary if it does work but if it
doesn't work then it could be one of the
biggest flops in history who knows love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
