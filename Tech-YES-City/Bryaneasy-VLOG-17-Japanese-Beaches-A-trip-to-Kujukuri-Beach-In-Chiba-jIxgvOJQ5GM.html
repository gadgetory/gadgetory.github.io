here today we are going to the beach and
it is a beach that is about 15 minutes
from my house now Japanese beaches guys
they are I'm going to tell you the
advantages and disadvantages compared to
Australia before we get to the beach so
the disadvantages first so obviously the
beaches aren't as beautiful as the
Australian beaches so I mean I come from
the gold coast where you know the old
coast is just lined with golden sands
Japanese beaches are pretty good like
they're not bad like but they're not the
sands not as good you know it's getting
you got Little Rock's sort of all over
the sand the waves are definitely not as
good and yeah the water temperature them
in some water it's cold in the beach so
you know who knows it's not bad in
summer right when you're hot you're
going to around swing the let's get on
to the advantages of the Japanese
beaches you can drink beer at Japanese
beaches so there are the beach we're
going today is not a big one but there
are especially in Chiba there's a beach
court on juku and it's got a lot of
beach parties as one in Tokyo near Tokyo
zoo sheet that's really popular
lots of parties there you guys so if you
come to Japan in the summer you want to
go to beach parties and you're in Tokyo
I'd recommend zushi if you are in Chiba
I recommend on juku very popular beaches
now this beach i'm going to today is
called could you could eat and it's 15
minutes so good you could eat and it's
15 minutes from my house so it's a bit
late in the afternoon to its
three-thirty just after and the reason
we're going in the afternoon is cuz of
little bee man you can't catch too much
drama summer thing it's not good for but
a little bit of Sun is definitely good
for him so we're going to take care of
him again take care of ourselves by
getting to the beach and having a good
time
he ok so for the beach now and be a
little bit manajemen is going to play
with and yeah guys this is the beach
pretty much so in the summer when it's
really humid you'd want to come over
here populars the other beaches but I
like it Emily man here's the sun's not
too strong today ok so we're closer to
the water now and yeah guys it's pretty
good so like today is actually a good
day the winds aren't too strong so you
may be getting a bit of wet noise and
the microphone which it's not that bad
but yeah usually come in the summer
probably once every two weeks as you
know usually once I started getting too
white I usually like got to get a bit of
a chance so usually come every couple of
weeks I'm not a sort of not i'm not one
of those guys that comes every day
although i'd like to but i do like to
come to the beach it's really really fun
so yeah guys if you want to come to
especially becoming in chiba can I guess
this beach if you live close on juku
beach is a good one so as I said before
and yeah guys you know it's just like I
guess going to the beach and any other
country so it's really cool today is
actually a really nice day and the water
is really good temperature so I'm going
to go in and have a nice swim now one
thing you remember so as you can see
here the waves aren't you know they're
just pretty subtle and not that good but
the there are in Japan to be especially
on the East Coast here it can get really
strong rips and you know you hear every
you know a couple of weeks likes in
summer someone died cuz they got caught
in a rip so something to be careful of
you know
it's a really weird they can keep you by
surprise so be careful of that to you
guys but usually most foreign is loud
never actually I don't think I've heard
of a foreign on that I've never read on
the news a foreigner dying from a rip so
you know cuz sudden are in australia
since we're kids will learn you know
we're trained just swimming all the time
so like you know how to handle thats the
officer anyway here's a little beer man
he's enjoying a bit of the water too
that's a little bit
bring the Japanese videos too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
