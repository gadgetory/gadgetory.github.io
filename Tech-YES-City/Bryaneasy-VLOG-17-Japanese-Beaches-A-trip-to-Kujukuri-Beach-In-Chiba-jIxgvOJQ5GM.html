here today we are going to the beach and
it is a beach that is about 15 minutes
from my house now
Japanese beaches guys they are I'm gonna
tell you the advantages and
disadvantages compared to Australia
before we get to the beach so the
disadvantages first so obviously the
beaches aren't as beautiful as the
Australian beaches so I mean I come from
the Gold Coast where you know the old
coast is just lined with golden sands
now the Japanese beaches are pretty good
like they're not bad like but they're
not the sands not as good
yeah it's getting you got little rocks
sort of all over the sand the waves are
definitely not as good and yeah the
water temperatures I mean some water
it's cold in the beach so you know who
knows it's not bad in summer right when
you're hot you're gonna around swing the
let's get onto the advantages of the
Japanese beaches you can drink beer at
Japanese beaches so there are the beach
we're going today is not a big one but
there are especially in Chiba there's a
beach called on tjuku and it's got a lot
of beach parties there's one in Tokyo
near Tokyo zoo sheet that's really
popular
lots of parties there you guys so if you
come to Japan in the summer you want to
go to beach parties and you're in Tokyo
I'd recommend sushi if you are in Chiba
I recommend on tjuku very popular
beaches
now this Beach I'm going to today is
called could you could eat and it's 15
minutes so could you could eat and it's
15 minutes from my house so it's a bit
late in the afternoon - its 3:30 just
after and the reason we're going in the
afternoon is cuz of little beam and you
can't catch too much strong summer think
it's not good for him but a little bit
of Sun is definitely good for him so
we're gonna take care of him I can take
care of ourselves by getting to the
beach and having a good time
in the summer when it's really humid
okay so we're closer to the water now
and you guys it's pretty good so like
today is actually a good day the winds
aren't too strong so you may be getting
a bit of wet noise in the microphone
which that bad yeah I usually come in
the summer probably once every two weeks
and you know usually once I started
getting too white I usually like yeah I
gotta get a bit of a tan so usually you
come every couple of weeks I'm not a
sort of not I'm not one of those guys it
comes every day although I'd like to but
I do like to come to the beach it's
really really fun so yeah guys if you
want to come to especially be coming in
chipper Ken I guess this Beach if you
live close on juku Beach is a good one
so as I said before you know just like I
guess going to the beach in any other
country so it's really cool today it's
actually a really nice day and the water
is really good temperature so I'm gonna
go in and have a nice swim now one thing
you remember so as you can see here the
waves aren't you know they're just
pretty subtle and not that good but the
there are in Japan to be especially on
the East Coast here it can get really
strong rips and you know you hear every
you know a couple of weeks like so in
summer someone died cuz they got caught
in a rip so it's something to be careful
of you know
very weird they can keep you by surprise
so be careful of that to you guys but
usually most foreign is live never
actually I don't think I've heard of a
foreign on that I've never read on the
news
a foreigner dying from a rib so you know
just I don't know in Australia since
their kids will learn you know we're
trained just swimming all the time so
you know how to handle that stop sir
anyway here's a little beer man he's
enjoying a bit of the water too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
