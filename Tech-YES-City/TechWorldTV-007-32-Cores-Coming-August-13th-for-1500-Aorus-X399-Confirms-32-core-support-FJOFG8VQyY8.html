tech wall TV episode 7 I'm joined by the
G but we escaped we escaped the R in the
e go straight to the G GG I'm joined by
GG from science studio how you doing man
I am doing all right how's it going over
there Sunday what Sunday midday for you
yes Sunday midday just been so
productive man it's been absolutely
crazy this last week I haven't stopped
right so I'm preparing for a little bit
of a holiday as well and during that
holiday I want to keep the viewers
entertained that when we're over in
Italy we're gonna get Austrian and Japan
there's three pots hunts coming too so
people are gonna get excited it's gonna
be cracking and then when I get back I
don't know what's going on after that no
plans how about you my man I'm lucky to
get out once a week and that's usually
just to buy groceries
oh so you travel oh wow so you do a one
week you do one leg splurge kind of
thing just stock the fridge and the
freezer up with them - right - you get
hot on the dim simps oh the pot is meat
pies meat pies no we do like hot pockets
chicken nuggets like the quick microwave
nails right just the stuff that ten
bucks it'll last for two weeks you know
they're gonna know it really cheap dude
like I live well within my means huh
say you are a deal hunter then you just
you don't really go much into it
okay well people want to see you deal
hunt man let's see what Greg's made off
so but we'll get we've the other tech
news out of the way first and then we
can sort of come back and talk a little
bit with the audience as well see what's
cracking with them see if they've got
any questions as well but first up we
got here that of course the big news
going around 32 cores 64 threads the
thread Ripper as well news that it's
going to be released on August 13th and
this is coming from WCF tech retweeted
it from twig town and we're looking at
here it will work on X 3 9 9 X we know
this from Computex but some companies
like horas are releasing the
motherboards refreshed motherboards that
obviously don't need a BIOS update they
have a beefier VRM
better vrm I've said that twice and what
we're looking at too with the pricing is
rumored anywhere from 1,500 to 2,000 USD
so what do you think about this do you
think the pricing is about right do you
think we're going to get this CPU in on
August 13th and it's gonna be priced
around 1,500 to 2,000 I personally think
we're getting closer to 2000 surely AMD
couldn't sell their 32 cord that cheap I
mean yeah that's one of them I mean like
when you think about 32 cores like
that's a ton I mean it you can overclock
those likely I mean that's there's just
too many cores to even fathom like what
are you gonna do now if you utilize all
32 for just the average Joe are you
gonna do with this course that's a lot
of cool right there like videos at the
same time you probably good like like
not joking man I mean the 18 core I
tried that out and that was just way too
much as well I was a lot 32 cause if you
know of course there's going to be
people out there that can utilize those
cores and threads yeah it's gonna
represent the nominal value for money
for those folks out there but um I mean
how much is gonna be priced I mean I
think I'd like to see AMD charge more
like that's honestly I'd like to see em
charge more for this it's a premium item
its flagship and it's gonna be beating
to come the competitors product I mean
all the guys are 28 29 that's what I'm
thinking about two grand I mean yeah
it's still that's still cheap that's
what I'm saying I mean that's what you
get the 79 80 XE for right I mean that's
a what 8 18 yeah yeah I'm using that
right now yeah it I mean to fathom the
difference that I mean 18 is already a
ton yeah right and then to get literally
almost twice that amount in a CPU that
cost the same and I mean overclocked
ability aside like having 32 cores is
just overkill for 99.99% of people out
there anyway yeah I mean to me that's
it's it's gonna be a good value with
respect to those people who are gonna
know what to do to utilize them you know
like people who program who compile all
those you know heavy intensive workloads
they're gonna be able to utilize
whatever you throw at it they're gonna
be fine but yeah people are gonna
struggle to take advantage of that many
cores it's just a showpiece law it
something us a lot but of course there
will be people that could utilize it I
mean what what the good thing is as they
say in this article I mean you're
looking at some of Intel's really
higher-end Zeon's cost like $9,000 and
that's on Amazon right now so Amazon and
like showing how expensive these CPUs
are it's a really disruptive process
that AMD of making here though what
they're saying is so true when I went to
their events they're saying they're just
bringing in the competition and they're
bringing it in hard and it's so good
because the end the end user wins
whether you like Intel or AMD you got to
pray props to this and yes the comments
I do a great judge are so underrated as
well you know it doesn't get much
attention but so I take care of them and
but 33 for 64 threads it's that like I'm
so curious to see what pricing they're
gonna use with this that's where
everything is the the eyes on the
pricing here because it's gonna be
flagship Intel really won't have
something that will come close to it and
it's gonna be hopefully you can get it
for key cuts on 32 cores that'd be
fantastic yeah that's what I'm reading
the comments here but people speculating
what they think you can get it at xfr or
just dismantle overclocking it voltage
power delivery looks like this is a 10
plus 3 phase but the good thing and
that's why risin is so good right you
look at the 18 core I didn't really want
to push that past 4 gigahertz but we
look at the other variants the tank or
you could get that 4.5 gigahertz you can
start to see it does even though it's
the mess-up mesh architecture still
starts to scale off a bit rise ins just
got those separate dies tied in with the
Infinity fabric and that's what makes a
4 gigahertz are obtainable with even 32
core 64 threads so AMD did plan for the
future and that's where they're going
with that so and Daniel says do I live
in the new studio and yeah I do
I also we've got some comments last week
sorry when I bumped you off Greg when
the donors came in yet people were like
having it go at me then I think one you
have the pitchfork out as well for me so
I just never I'll never hold it again
yeah I just said like I just said isn't
it like when you stream isn't it common
light practice to answer donation
straight away like I thought that was
like every streamer I what
does that so yeah I mean we're all gonna
do like what I do is usually like if
because they're always delayed right
like someone will donate to you and then
ask a question that's what I encourage
people to do on when I live stream and
then you know by the time I notice it
right there watching it and I'm already
delayed because when they send the note
the donation you know they're watching a
live stream that has maybe a 10 20
second buffer to it so it's gonna be
delayed no matter what but usually what
I'll do is just finish my own point and
then look back at the chain if there are
a couple donations I'll address them but
yeah I usually address them right they
can write at the time I get them so
don't worry about that
rock on okay so next article we've got
up here is the X 3 9 9 as well it's kind
of confirming now so I previously I
heard about 24 cores being the max but
this slide here pretty much confirms
we're getting 6 32 cores 64 threads on X
399 now I did see this motherboard at
Computex it was there refresh X 399
motherboard and it was indeed extreme
like though gone all out with this thing
to 8 pins it was just it's you know
ducks nuts
it's absolutely crazy even I think
they're putting it 10 gigabits per
second Ethernet on board which I do want
to critique straight away like when
you're looking at 10 Gigabit Ethernet
when you're whacking it on motherboards
I'd watch mother watch mother men my
English is terrible today dude I'm gonna
stumbled tumble all through this live
stream but when you're putting a 10
gigabit snick on board your motherboard
you're basically taking the value way of
having your own dedicated solution like
I did critique this and I started to
create this with asrock because you just
go out buy your own card for a hundred
bucks and then poured it over from
motherboard the motherboard and the
value you know if you're not using it
the value you're wasting the value
because I'm sure a lot of people would
just want to buy this motherboard the
fact that it has the new BIOS in there
they can get the 32 cores
they've got that beefy vrm but then
they're gonna be overpaying for that
Tang gigabits per second solution so I
mean what do you think there yeah I mean
it's the same you're gonna be limited
ultimately by what I would think your IP
or ISP I see a lot of people down here
talking about like why are there three
Ethernet ports
like why would you want three lamport's
on a motherboard and you some of them
are you know you can duplex them I heard
through put the good stuff but
ultimately I mean like what I usually do
because I live in an apartment right I
don't have every wall connected to a
jack that I can running from my modem
from a switch so I have most of these
that are outside of the main room
connected via Wi-Fi so I've already got
a pretty you know the performance
degradation there's already pretty
existent um I've never really been like
all you know excited about 10 gigabits I
know that was something that was on was
it the supercarrier
I think it was one of the board's I
reviewed from asrock a while back that
had the I don't know if it was five
gigabits or 10 gigabit so that I was
mentioning there you know this is just
something that I think is for a very
niche market and that's really how this
whole platform is set up it's designed
that way right you only buy this if you
want to be that guy it's the best of the
best yeah oh yeah I mean it would look
weird it's like having a really like
nice you know sports car with like the
trashiest set of rims that you've ever
seen you know like just having all these
extra features just to kind of blend in
with the CPU the socket the power
delivery vrm all the good stuff just
kind of makes it cohesive so you think
they just doing it because they can it's
the best bond and they've got all the
yet you get you're getting leather seats
on this thing as well oh yeah whether
your bucks for this board yeah they'll
charge easily half half a grand for this
board you know and and that's and so you
don't want to give any buyer a potential
buyer a reason to doubt the price right
so you don't want to have any weak
points you don't want to have any
selling points that just seem lackluster
and just touting 10 gigabits just sounds
way better apparently than touting five
kick of its actually man that's well as
going into with the deal hunting as well
like the more I get into it the more I
realize numbers cell species forget
about 2 LED fans 4 LED fans that sells
like I'm serious man whoa Mike did you
imagine you spell it out do you spell
out the word for fo you are you're in
dude I know you write the number people
love numbers so for Ellie
yeah and what you do is you put it in
there and then this kid you could you
picture this kid he's gonna run to his
mom as soon as he sees that ad like mom
it's got LED fans gonna buy it now bang
you get the call is it still available
and you know exactly but as soon as you
hear that is it still available in that
desperate voice you're like damn I'm
getting an asking price for this the
same thing is somebody else I'm working
with you know like if you come across
like you desperately want something
don't expect to haggle too much with
this hi guys I guess a comment as well
got some cool comments as well people
love in the content especially the use
price performance like I said that's
hard that's the heart and soul of the
channel everything's staying the way it
is I also got a hard night drinking know
if I look tired guys we would literally
like me and my video editor work out
like just driving around just doing one
hour drives and stuff dropping off PCs
really hustling you know even a Friday
night who cares
people need pcs we're doing it you know
so it's really cool like I just love
this gig man behind the scenes as well I
wish I could just set up a livestream
camera for people and just do live
streaming like all the stuff that goes
on behind the scenes because I just
don't have time to edit and video all of
it you know what I mean otherwise the
studio is you saw in the previous vlog I
did that's what will happen it'll just
like crap we'll just pile up and pile up
and I've got to do a lot of stuff behind
the scenes to move that and keep things
going but it'd be so much fun to just
livestream it and then you wouldn't have
to edit and do all this stuff with
videos so I don't know anyway yeah when
we're over in the States like apparently
I'm going I've been have the tickets not
booked yet but I'll be over in the
States in August next month latent late
next month so perhaps we could go on a
little deer hunt maybe it's just putting
it out there sounds really fun yeah and
I'm driving your car as well oh is that
so yeah and I'm gonna thrash it and then
when I'm done with it the tappets are
gonna be ringing so hard you me like
damn like
but have you ever had there's so many
computers man in that car it's so
difficult like I'll spin the wheels in
second year right like it's it doesn't
grip very well considering
but the traction control like just the
computers monitoring the wheel spin the
you know the limited slip diff
distributing power to different wheels
you know differently torque vectoring
whatever you want to call it it just
there's so much technology that at this
point any newer car that's gonna be
rear-wheel drive it's just you got to
turn off like 10 different things to get
your your back-end to kind of flail out
you know like I've really tried and it's
even with traction control off you can't
like that car just wants to stay
straight how 50 it ties to 45 I want to
say 255 Alta Jack should whack some 285
zon there and you're not going anyway
they're staggered though like the rears
are bigger they're noticeably bigger
than the front yeah but I mean that's
it's just I don't think they're big
enough really and they have an all-wheel
drive model but terrible tires on the
all-wheel drive so okay if you've ever
done that in the past if you have it
lent someone your car and it came back
totally okay well I would never let
anyone my god well I did you know back
when I was a teenager you first car
someone borrows it whatever and then
yeah it comes back and you're like damn
this gearbox feels a little funny clutch
just feels like Oh existing anymore
my dad he had somebody I think he paid
somebody to cut his lawn or something
one time yeah and he we came back from
vacation and there was just this big ol
hole like on the side of the frame I
mean this is metal and this isn't
plastic it's like a metal frame that
houses the blade you know there's just a
hole like a rusted out hole that somehow
got there in a week I don't know
chemistry that well but like I'm pretty
sure rust doesn't take place in a week
probably had some special formula like
salt water the hairdryer and just like
really it's based on the process yeah
and they give it anyway this car came
back so screwed up like I'm pretty sure
from memory we were changing gears
without even sticking the clutch in
anymore like it was that much yeah like
you just there was no difference and
we're like damn and there's only a
thousand dollar car so it's like the
good thing is guys if you're out there
and you're young please make sure you
spend little to no money on your first
car because you're gonna ruin it that's
a good advice yeah and then once you
make all your mistakes then you cannot
step things up to a better car and also
get a tank get a beefy car that's not
gonna let you down as well it's yeah I'm
ever crashing into a pool one time like
it was it was pretty funny so it good
old straight poles you know I was there
pretty strong but it back to back to
tech news back to the tech museum next
time we we got 7 nanometre Vega 20 is
coming with 20 teraflops of
computational power with a 70% reduction
in die size so apparently going down
seven nanometer but they're not bringing
this out to the consumer gamer GPUs for
quite some time but they're bringing
this out next week apparently prices are
still unconfirmed and apparently is
gonna surf is that the right word that
is sir absolutely
you know so you know we did sneak in and
sort of take the Thunder away from
Nvidia with their Tesla V 100 which
currently has 15.7 teraflops of
computational power like if you have you
sort of ready I mean of course a lot of
people would love to get their hands on
this and tested for gaming just like
they did with Nvidia's new GPU there
they never released to the public was it
tight and tightened v was it tightened v
yeah tense recorders yeah and they that
was more powerful but it was $3,000 and
great I'm sure some people will be doing
this just to see the potential of the
next generation now but again drivers is
a big issue
AMD of probably not even gonna bother
really programming the sector gaming
yeah optimization on the developer side
too I mean just you know the gaming side
that's what we saw with Vegas 64 being
such a flop people saw the tee flop now
and they're like whoa you know thirteen
point seven or whatever
teraflop that was the highest teraflop
you know floating-point precision ever
in a consumer-grade graphics card that
wasn't you know $5,000 but you know
while it was a great computer like a
great multitasker a very workhorse
oriented it wasn't a great gamer I mean
not not considering what people expected
it to be it was around 1080 territory
which the price reflected that so you
can't really knock on Vegas 64 for that
but I think people overhyped it because
all they looked at was a tee flop count
and just said well you know this looks
like a really powerful graphics card and
then woops nope it's just about on par
with a 1080 which is a much lower
you know teraflop value sighs yeah it's
kind of hard to just judge straight up
from these figures here how efficient
these cards will be in gaming it'll be
fun to test but I think this is more or
less AMD flexing back right at Nvidia
for doing the same thing with Titan v
yes we did get a quick dynamic wait
until you finished talking say guys I'm
learning okay someone praised I learned
so I got a donation from Brian
bps cosmides Brian as well with an i/o
and he said when am I going to the US do
some PC he said I can borrow his comment
no no I said no I can't oh so I can't
drive his car too ok so I'm not the guy
I was just joking before I'm not the guy
that's gonna take your car and thrash it
I Drive it carefully I Drive anyone's
car carefully I'm not a thrashing man
come on you're either a Thrasher or
you're a care taker look at how I treat
the use Potts I take care of them
same deal with you car if you lend it to
me it's gonna get taken care of but yeah
we can do some parts honey man I'll see
how we go I do want to like I'd love to
roadtrip the states ultimately just rent
some car roadtrip do like Matty and road
trip through the states and just pots on
that'd be pretty cool fractal Josh to
hook you up with that Hertz rental no
yeah I don't really talk to fractal that
much like I did a review for them but
that was through another retailer and I
was like it had to go they are they big
in Australia like do you you see lot of
practice out of them
not really it's more of an acquired
taste and I was like it's definitely
more towards late you know is it's more
Corsair Coolermaster you know and then
you've got the budget choices like wrote
Amiens from msy which people just don't
care because they just want cheapest
case possible I said like the marketing
like is it is it just you don't see a
lot of their cases marketed on Ozzie
sites this is a price trainer you know
as people just want the best price like
best values cause these are always about
that value man so you've got like I mean
course that did hit pretty hard with
their 570 X I think like had all the RGB
control RGB fans tempered glass people
saw that as a flagship case for a good
price and when that came along that's
sort of like really and the H 500 P you
know that's behind the scenes that's
getting a really good rep and thanks
Nate as well great I'm doing a great
stream yet Nate's in discord as well
he's a he's a moderator so we've got um
sorry H 500 P that was nice had the to
RGB fans it looked nice airflow is
pretty good like I saw the temperatures
on that thing it wasn't bad it's not all
about cranking your fans up to a hundred
percent speed and then seeing how ditch
how much of a detriment they are a lot
of times I'll have my fans just running
quiet but getting still good airflow
yeah so I don't know I don't know cases
that just try it and if you try it and
you like it buy it so yeah I think it's
mostly aesthetic in their cases out
there that are not very well designed
clearly yeah from a functional
standpoint from an airflow standpoint in
price to performance in that respect
features but what I usually regard when
I look at cases is just the aesthetic
factor like is it how is how is this
gonna make my parts look better you know
what can I do to make this look unique
and not so mainstream presentation it
means it's a is this case gonna allow me
to flip this pace a quick oh that's
pretty much the same comes yeah I'm
gonna live it but is that presentation
is that like you like this is the case
just about like showing off the inside
making sure it looks pretty for people
having that left you know a tempered
glass or you know whatever panel you got
there and people can see inside of or
just like you know it's a much of a
muchness man I find just LED fans you
don't even have to have RGB you just
have to pick a color Reds usually the
best I like red it's subtle it's not too
in-your-face but it does look very sexy
so it all depends man I might have to do
a video on which which color sells the
best red versus blue versus green I'd be
pretty funny we put up the same PC three
different ads and then we see which one
sells first I reckon red would sell
first cuz you know why yeah do you know
why though runs maybe fastest hey Pepsi
its red is the color of impulse my
friend of impulse yeah really
yes psychology hmm this marketing man
red is that's why I love red red is just
like it that's why the backgrounds are
red like you see the red background here
people want to quickly watch the stream
so smart
not me not not really I just like red as
well amazing couple bit red is the color
of impulse so if you're doing cheap
items or sort of budget items always use
red in your marketing any way you can so
blue is the colour of trust so if this
was a blue background people would
probably trust my news source more it's
just subliminal marketing never use and
then and then yellows like the colour
friendly don't like yellows like you
know hahaha so you probably see a lot of
streamers using yellow if they're smart
just too especially I mean actually not
going to say probably triggers some
sjw's especially female stream you know
get some get some dudes nee like a the
friendly get yellow you know welcoming
in here no problems so yeah that's
that's marketing I love Martin me
there's a lot more to it you know people
think oh yes man sister dumbass who got
a dumpster trash got a PC parts on it
there's a lot more to me man than that
don't worry I've never learned that mmm
where I took two but this is my third
marketing class I haven't they don't
talk about stuff like that in our
classes I mean this is all about like I
don't know just how to sell products but
like not on like a personal though it's
more about like mass selling right look
working for a big company not on small
scale
I imagine that would be something we'd
focus on if we did like a micro
marketing class that sounds really cool
so yeah also back on that so we'll just
quickly finish off this news then we can
go to the comments section as well so 7
nanometre Vega of course the teraflops
performance may be there but it's not
always just about this number would you
agree it's not that's usually never I
mean yeah we've seen this so much in the
past where people just flaunt these tea
flops numbers and then like yeah Vega
came out Vega 64 Vega 56 came out and
just got hammered
so really won't lose there's a lot of
sort of behind the scenes stuff that
goes into optimization but 7 nanometre
is impressive I love what AMD did with
the RX 470 and 480 they're easily 2 of
my favorite cards from AMD in the last
few years they're really they were
really nice and they're still nice to
this day they're still awesome and then
the 580 and the 570 came out it was like
much of a muchness I still even when
those cards came out I did prefer the
417 480 that what we got here is the rx
580 lot speaking of the 580 last news
source here apples releasing a MacBook
Pro external GPU and it'll cost you
$6.99 so I mean we just want to have a
bit of fun here a bit of fun here
straight away the first thing that comes
to my mind is okay guys mining craze is
done we got a heap of our x5 80s to get
rid of how can we sell them oh I know
just advertise some fancy Mac external
box look at the marketing and get a
return on that you they're gonna get a
hundred percent return well two hundred
percent of you I mean are you looking at
this photo here so proud I mean the
Lighting's perfect that girls like
getting into it now that she's got an Rx
580 box here that costed us $6.99
she's like wired in like she's serious
that doesn't look like it's widen it all
just sitting there but it's placebo
right now she's got it there she can now
seriously do it work and this guy he's
like he's a dude that looks like you
that's like it's funny though that's
your last you and the end like you're
helping this chick out yeah and you and
Apple dude can spirit we're going
straight into conspiracy theory this is
a
Gregg Salazar is a Mac shill this is
this crap this is it dude that is Gregg
like I'm I'm a hundred percent set and
that is you in that photo dude you know
you know he's really putting out you've
been caught out what are you gonna say
you if you look at her screen like I
don't know I haven't used violent cut
pearl in a in a while yeah but what
she's running there on her screen is
that Final Cut Pro it's not say man it's
too little looks like mean look good
leave you could be permeate Pro from my
view and all looks like Pro in which
case that would be extremely oxymoronic
because you don't have like stream
processor acceleration in Premiere Pro
you have CUDA acceleration so you would
benefit no you do know now you do man
they didn't introduce they did introduce
it yeah I'm pretty sure
oh right now let me check I'm pretty
sure they'll and that's only everybody
unless they took it away I mean I did
use an AMD card and I did get open and
what's the other one again sorry open
see yeah yeah OpenCL
yeah I remember being there dude and I
did test in the past this is like I
don't know they're maybe they took it
away if they did that's so bad yeah I'm
just getting CUDA and software donations
was going a little bit weird at the
moment sorry guys about the text Marvin
says needs more Zeon's of course man Z
Hans is life jion's is life I love my
Zeon's to I've ordered a few more like
Aliexpress dollars takes sometimes too
long to get years eons you're hanging
out and you're like I want my Zealand
and they don't come for like 30 days
sometimes they rock up in a week it's so
hit and miss with Ollie's shipping
sometimes because you know this little
pet man perhaps he's so cute oh she's
like just playing with the ball now and
so but yeah back to this conspiracy
theory guys do you reckon Greg is
confirmed let us know in the comments do
you reckon is a confirmed macbook pro
she'll with this external GPU for $6.99
dude I'm not gonna lie like that looks
like me five years it does ice cliff I
shaved and then like Grune myself cut my
hair a little bit which means a couple
pounds yeah it dudes his uh his his
wrist there look pretty vascular like
he's been lifting so I got a I got a
pickup pick up the slack we went too
much okay there that's like that is I
can confirm us you with the eyebrows
have been trimmed a little bit nose
looks the same chin looks Pierce's
haircuts like yeah a little bit less
maybe you filmed this like about a month
ago whatever just after yeah yeah you
straight off the computation went
through the MacBook all right there we
go guys that's this week's conspiracy
theory we've always got to run it and
that's why me and guys saying yeah guys
are saying it's shield totally man it's
confirmed
that's it dude you've been caught on so
we're gonna go over to chat now if you
guys have questions we're gonna answer
them for you both Greg and I and then
we'll wind down the show and if you want
to do are you doing after hours this
week we can go yeah I'll be doing it
tomorrow night tomorrow night at night
if you need to go home just let me know
I actually will do that sleep are you
gonna be free what 9:00 tomorrow is same
time your time tomorrow right okay good
yeah I'll be ready I'm always ready born
ready gear so okay so will annex 3470
bottleneck and on iron fury at fourteen
forty forty forty Pino won't if you
overclock it it'll be absolutely fine
1440p great combination actually at that
resolution yeah I get it to four
gigahertz you're all good so next
question we got here is Brian and studio
dude so you're the studio dude that's it
just calling this the stud oh he called
me studio together you can rubra v8 that
take out the i/o and call it the stud
dude I'm picking up msi gt80 have a 1080
TI for 430 pounds and he's getting proof
of purchase would be nice to see a video
about warranties EVGA stopped guests are
amazed
would that be like transfer of ownership
warranties they stop decisions yeah as
if you sell it used yeah
oh I thought they warranties were
transferable it's I mean it's
technically just a warranty based on the
purchase itself I believe in ours
it would be valid that new warranties
are transferable I'm pretty sure you
know I don't know about the UK of course
have you buying that car just make sure
it works
that's that's the biggest thing you
would be taking a gamble if the warranty
is non-transferable so if you've got
anything to say about that what's it
like in the States
well I don't know I've never really
thought I mean I'm just trying to think
about the number of cards I've had died
on me mm-hmm
or have issues that I've had to RMA or
in which I've had to arm it hmm I had to
1080 T eyes die with well the span of
yeah and this was something I was I was
kind of like on the fence about talking
about way back when when it happened but
it was about six months ago I was P and
Wyatt sent me to 1080 T eyes and they
were reference boards right so yeah so
Nvidia boards and I had put water blocks
on the I put a water block on the first
one put it in a custom loop ran fine for
about a day and I stopped getting signal
so I was like troubleshooting everything
came down to the graphics card just it
wouldn't work I took it out of that
system put it somewhere else no picture
on that system either so I was like okay
well this boards dead and I don't know
what I did to it so I took another board
I put the same block on that board you
know this is the second card that they
had sent me the founders Edition one and
same thing dude it was dead like
straight up I put it in the system and
it died and you know I can't narrow down
I can't say that it was something I did
maybe I did put water blocks on so many
graphics cards like I don't know what I
would have done the like I flex the
board enough to pull up pins or whatever
yeah but you know it could have been the
system that shorted something I have no
idea but it happened on two of them back
to back there's the only time I've ever
really had issues with graphics cards so
I can't say that it would even did you
use this use the same water block on
both I think it was a second but I think
I left the water block on the first card
and it's still sitting actually
somewhere
and then I used a second block same
block though same design but yeah I just
I never made a video because I didn't I
didn't know really were to start how to
troubleshoot it narrow it down to like a
specific thing that I could point to so
I just kind of left it yeah I've had
some issues but it was quickly answered
Dez Jones always says family both are we
work I like watching and we watching
dear and I'm so my English is terrible
guys today are we watching the finals
the FIFA finals
France vs. Croatia actually I probably
will that's that's awesome oh yeah
that's worth watch I didn't watch I
don't watch soccer a whole lot guys
the theatrics does it for me and in Oz
it's really not that popular because of
that and so we also got to Nollan
donation as well Greg fellow Florida
he's a fellow his he's from Florida as
well des Jones donated again so thank
you thank you so much for the donations
with the with the with the GPUs they're
probably I'm coming into something
different though mine's more cause and
effect and I have to talk to other
people who are having similar problems I
basically with my problem with the CPU
that died in the recent video that could
be a bad batch of something and I'm not
gonna really talk about it but I gotta
actually test it before and after I'm
I'm gonna actually run a dedicated test
of my own now and I'd like if someone's
got a microscope a microscope and can
examine things really to a fine point
then I'd love them for them to contact
me so I can get some more evidence
because I've been using liquid parondi
lids for years and I've never had one
problem whatsoever and then I change and
I've actually had three dead CPUs now so
something's not right and again I could
have had a bad batch but I got to talk
about it before I do sort of start
blasting or whatever because I don't
want that last thing I want is to blast
someone for something and it's not I
don't have a 100% proof so all's oh yeah
I've been talking about this in the
discord a bit but yeah I'd say be the
waterblock possibly could have had you
know I mean the tension and then it just
those those dyes are so sensitive men
especially a 1080i dye which is a bigger
dye you've got more of a
this area in other words more things
could go wrong so yeah I don't know I
just I just know that you know that
wasn't my first rodeo I had done that
probably ten blocks before that just in
that year alone but they've all the
different custom loops I was putting
together and I had never heard of just a
block dying because it was I mean I
obviously know if you could if you
flexiboard enough it's gonna something
snaps I know the silicon was better if
you flex it yeah no shadow just ever
yeah yeah but I mean I did nothing you
know nothing remotely close to that I
mean all I was doing was laying the card
flat you know and applying the block on
one side flipping it over mounting it on
the other screwing it down and calling
it I mean huh I don't know what I could
have done to do that but I I couldn't
prove it I couldn't prove anything so I
just had to send them back and say you
know oh my god that's why that's again
why I never made a video because man
thank you
fair enough so we got some more
questions coming in as well I did miss
one is it worth it to buy eBay pcs put
them in new cases and yeah I mean guys
any deal is worth it if the price is
right that's what the whole that's what
pole purpose of the deal hunting that
that comes out of my channel always look
at the price if you can pick up
something for a good good price just
pick it up do whatever you got to do
with it
even if it means you have to go quickly
buy a new case for 40 bucks buy a power
supply for 30 and then repurpose that
machine by a hard drive even 100 dollars
new hard drive past blind case if you
can get those three for 100 bucks and
then grab a deal hunter GPU put it in
with that o a.m. you got yourself a
build now what else you do with that is
up to you we've got some cool other sort
of different videos hitting the channel
in relation to deal hunting so stay
tuned for those but yeah it's always
worth it so we keep the keep the cache
questions rolling as well what's going
on hey Nicholas not much man just just
live streaming and so what's my favorite
Z on at the moment yeah it is a hard
question Marvin asked what's my favorite
Z on this I'm any man I'd go with the
x34 40s definitely one of them x 56 75
I've still got to try the six
still sitting there just got so much
other work to get through and also there
is the X the III 1231 v3 on a be 85
that's a great combo as well so there's
a few there's there's sort of like my
top four picks for gamers and end users
they all offer a little bit of something
else the six core 12 thread being a good
balance obviously the eight core 16
thread I believe that would be a great
video editing zeon but have you got any
experience with zealand's yeah I've
built with two I think one of them was
not something I should have built with I
just did it because I had it on hand
the other one was it was a it was an a1
a 1230 v3 I want to say yeah I don't
remember it was has no basis well they
Tuesday okay then it then it was then it
was v4 because I remember I built with
it because it was like 20 or 30 bucks
cheaper than this the 6700 um you know
the locked PI seven and so I had to buy
a Z on board I forget the name of the
bead tooth like 232 or something like
that there's no C 232 yeah I've only
built it too and I only reason I did
because it was slightly cheaper than i7
I said look the only thing it doesn't
have here is an eye GPU everything else
pretty much is the same I don't remember
if it's supported ECC memory or not I
think that was I think I think it did
but you could just use you know the good
stuff yeah yeah so I mean definitely not
my forte that's for sure yeah it's I
mean it's up to you but you got to get
into the Zeon's once you get into the
Zeon's you'll appreciate the Zeon's and
then though you'll learn them yeah I'm
just like guys I'm gonna do an X 58
overclocking tutorial but you're in a
relationship with Lisa you learn what
Lisa's about you know the food she likes
the things she does same with the Xeon
you gotta treat her right you got to
know what she likes gotta know the price
that she's purchase yeah oh yeah now I'm
gone off and we shouldn't go on this
tangent
and it does joins another donation
thanks a lot man you should should I
stick with the as rock x3 99m or wait
for a second gen mobo x3 no not depends
on the CPU you want to go with if you
want to go that 32 core 64 thread dare
I'd say you'd may wish to look at
getting one with D beefiest v RM and
again if this is a two thousand dollar
CPU wouldn't you want to get that super
at high-end motherboard for five hundred
bucks and sort of take care of it like I
mean no no it's a lot of money but
you're spending a lot of money on the
CPU definitely spend a lot of money on
the other components as well to make
sure things are running right that's all
I'm gonna say
I'd say next 309 M might have a little
bit of trouble with a 32 or 64 thread
that's just off the top of my head that
would be my advant my advice at the
moment what is the best case for water
cooling in your opinion Greg you're
going to ask the question no best case
for water glam assuming custom water
coin yep it would uh I mean when it
comes to custom water cooling I would
say there's a there's a get to balance
it out right you can go with a really
big case and have so much space to work
with right but then you almost feel
obligated to fill in all that empty
space right with the tubing runs with
extra radiators thick rads whatever I
always try with custom leaves to keep
things as densely packed as possible I
hate that I hate empty space in a case
so the smaller the better I would say
the the most technically difficult you
can make it without actually like
wanting to throw the case across the
room in order to keep it as compact as
possible while at the same time
maintaining enough rad space to
adequately cool the components you're
trying to cool is you're like that's
your fine line there so you gotta find
that point I think the the leniently PCO
11 dynamic is a really great case for
water cooling you can pretty much deck
it out to rads will do it just fine if
you're going for a single rad combo i
would say i mean any mid-sized tower
that has a 360 you know mount on it
that'll let you integrate a pump and
reservoir that's usually the toughest
thing to get into a case that size you
should be fine you know even like an s3
for i built a custom loop in an s3 40
elite you know like even you can do it
in case
that aren't really water cooling
friendly as long as you plan your loop
properly upfront and then I've been
making and they asked you guys join GN
mod mat club I can't say I have I have
one I did station did you get us in yeah
yeah yeah yeah he produce it he brought
his in it because it's I'm you know I'm
close to him I got left out yeah okay
I'm sad ozzie club I'm not in the club
man yeah I'm sorry I'm good man it
really is it it's it's uh you know fine
pointed on the edges so it just square
it off but I have a table that's kind of
rounded so I I kind of groom the edges
to kind of wrap around and it fits this
table I haven't here perfectly so I mean
look stays you jaja could be on your
game as Nexus mod Matt that's all I'm
gonna say
you left him out not me I don't care I
can take it you left him male announcer
what's your opinion on the knock in
Hades Canyon oh man it is my favorite
Intel product in a very long time I
absolutely love the knock it is so damn
good that's what I'm gonna say it is
just I'm gonna make I mean I'm gonna
make probably another video later on but
it's pretty much made mini-itx
irrelevant that's that's my opinion on
the knock it's just it it's a powerhouse
it's so little so lightweight its man
they've done an amazing job on it that's
all I'm gonna say with the knock it's so
damn good and it's a it's just what it
is man it's for me it's like I look at
the in wind choppin which was already a
ridiculously small case you couldn't
even fit a graphics card in it and then
you got the nook which is is smaller
it's like half the size of the the in
wind choppin and it's like what you can
fit this thing in a backpack and it's
just a powerhouse 4k video editing
mobile solution that will play games at
1080p fine we'll do video rendering with
32 gigs of sodium in it I absolutely
love that price is amazing
I wish I'd sad though the AMD didn't do
this this is what I think AMD intended
to do with an APU way back in the day
they intended to have something so small
that you could whack in that had so much
power in it and it's sad that Intel
stolen that fund
with the knock that's what I'm sad about
like what yes I was really that's what I
was disappointed at and they didn't do
this
Intel's done it now so um yeah but
that's the knock I it's it's I've got
nothing but good things to say about
that it's so damn good and the price
really isn't that bad - you get the not
that not a flagship want just the model
a little bit below that you you get a
good that's a good deal like that's
actually a solid deal for the money so
yeah Hades Canyon knock so anyway that's
the CEO to Vega graphics it's beautiful
yeah so alright any questions any more
questions
what is NOK small computer yeah it's
like a really small computer usually
they were used for offices or people who
just didn't need any GPU power but now
Intel's made one with a graphics
solution bit more power and it's pretty
much like a desktop but in a small
computer I mean what doesn't rival like
anything super powerful like you know
just six core 12 thread a 700 K and it
still got great power at its disposal so
we got a psmf found a dual socket 1366
server and the garbage got any cool
ideas what you should do with it I try
and grab the highest multiplier zero and
just single single core xeon run a
single xeon in it and then repurpose it
as a gaming pc running to is iran's on
1366 is laggy that's just my opinion on
it I mean I'm gonna do it with the SR 2
just for you know for aesthetics and for
the looking for the video and for these
nostalgia but for running an actual
serious gaming PC or flippin whatever
your intention is I just grabbed a
single Z on leave the socket and leave
the second sock attempt you just put a
cover over it get even bend the pins if
you want to have a bit of fun but I
haven't gotten x3 99m yet but I was
thinking since I was looking at it yeah
it's nice with the 12 chord Dez really
nice with the tilt 12 core it'd be a
great thing so oh the ok boot man wants
to send me a GN mod mat dude that's
that's amazing I'll take it for sure man
just send us an email or join our
discord yeah discord is open as well
we've got asked about that as well
discord is pretty much open for people
who want to come in I will say though
it's not open to sjw's we do not
cept social justice warriors in our
discord you get been pretty much
straight away sister really chilled this
Corp we just hang out we make cool
content and then we talk with that you
know talk with our viewers it's such a
good community should you buy an x 56 75
instead of an X 34 74 about $8 more it
all depends men do different platforms
it all depends max on if you can get the
x58 motherboard if you can definitely X
56 75 is so good because it's 95 watt
TDP as opposed to the X 56 80 and 56 90
which 135 watt TDP so technically
they're better bin that's the idea
behind the 56 75 ok so what's up with
hardware on box I do not know what's up
with hardware I'm boxed and spoke to him
for a while so I and can you leave me in
the disco will right after we do this
Greg you like my name I don't know I
think we're winding down now
so are we winding down with a shot we're
gonna one down trauma Collington says
thank you for burning sjw's yeah I can't
stand it yeah I just can't stand it man
anymore making a stand she's on a place
for like it's just not I just yeah
actually I can't stand this you can't
have an opinion because my opinions the
perfect one or something in a perfect
world the world ain't perfect and we
just got to you know hustle and do our
best and work and work our asses off
that's essentially my attitude in life
and yeah I find I don't align well with
sjw's so that's just my stance on it all
and I mean I've never gotten along with
them in the past so whatever now we just
got an awesome community and we all just
chat freely and things are cool yeah
anyway Greg
so patron stream we might we might gonna
do a patron stream if Greg's up for it
too maybe if you have to work I might a
lot of school work it's 10:00 p.m. by
10:00 p.m. and I gotta wake up early and
get back to it okay so yeah Dez is
looking at the 12 cool I know Dez you've
really said that so many times before
came up and left
alright anyway thanks a lot guys
love you all we're gonna wind down the
show now unless there is just one more
question weekend yeah everyone's just go
on Zeon mad now and the quitter loves
the arms again hey did you watch the
door TVs about chip blitz and what are
your thought I haven't seen that video
yet so I will go watch it soon sorry I
just been way too busy trying to
schedule videos out for the whole
upcoming holiday as well but I'll take a
look at it and yeah I'll let you guys
know so I do I do like gym where you get
it we get along behind the scenes he's
you know he seems like I'd love to meet
him in real life but I mean yeah
whatever like yeah the real life thing
it's always good yeah we'll get ya put
the link in the description below for
discord we'll catch you guys soon
unless Greg wants to answer this last
question from Ben oh wait which one am i
answering what is the whole power supply
unit degradation over time and how does
80 plus matter and how reliable the HSU
is I can sir that quick I have a video
dedicated specifically to efficiencies
and other scale but in a nutshell
typically more efficient power supplies
are gonna be higher wattage and the
reason why you want to do it that way is
because the the margins right of power
loss are higher when you're a higher
wattage unit so a thousand watt unit
that's 80 plus bronze right which is
pretty bad for a thousand watt unit is
going to lose more power in the form of
heat you know just straight up from a
numbers standpoint because it's
outputting more power proportionately so
usually the lower end units like you
know 400 500 watt those stay around
bronze to gold most of the time just
because those usually peak at around 90
percent or so efficiency and at that
point like you're maybe saving 5 to 10
watts right so thousand watts totally
different like you're saving twice to
three times as much power especially
when you're talking about like platinum
or titanium especially when you're in
that efficiency curve peak which is
usually around 40 to 70 percent load so
there's a video dedicated to it but in a
nutshell yeah that's why they scale that
way and in terms of you know degradation
over time there's not really degradation
it's just more or less you know how well
it's built is it's again directly linked
to its efficiency and they're gonna
scale you know that way you expect the
titanium power supply to last longer
than well something it's nice so what
happens with it the components do
degrade over time like you know caps
inside are gonna get less efficient just
ever so slight but what they do with
power supplies is usually a good power
supply manufacturer will make a 650 watt
actually go a little bit higher so it'll
run 720 what day-in day-out
but they do that so over time even if
you do get a bit of degradation it'll
still run 650 watt for a very long time
that's just the whole thing yes yeah
your engine in your car wear out over
time
anything will wear out over time just
degrades wear and tear same with power
supplies but it's nothing to really
worry about if you buy a good power
supply as well as have I found a power
supply blow up on me yeah I had a couple
mainly this is yeah they've been the
cheap ones my first one didn't blow up
it like it just started like seeping out
this very seedy smell and I actually
threw up because I was in the room of it
what's going on here I smell this smell
so I was watching just some movies on
the other PC while I was trying to I
think I was just running a stress test
on this thing
and there's this ages ago and I was
getting into overclocking this is going
back like over 10 years and yeah I just
start smelling and then just yet it
suddenly went bang kaboom like I saw
something you know that little flash
like you sort of flash and then yeah it
just dramatically died and you're like
oh ok something really messed up but I
had to go vomit after that because
whatever the smell let off and let off
some really bad chemicals so yeah that
was um that was my first power supply
blow up I mean I've had some others just
died I mean yeah it's usually the cheap
ones so anyway we're gonna get out of
here thank you guys so much tuning in to
tech world TV and thanks so much Greg
for coming on it links to Greg's channel
in the description below as well I'll
put that Dischord link for you guys
thanks for the donations as well
appreciate everything you guys do for
the channel as well you guys keep it
alive and it's it's awesome
we'll catch you guys in another tech
video very soon you want to catch some
closing statements Greg
but by no it's dude it's peace out for
no I'll do it in please not now
now boy peace out for now by like dude
you got to get it right man like peace
out for now buddy these out for now dude
like by gonna do it so there we go so
now boy catches</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
