crackalacking this is the used monthly
parts hunt every month where I go out
look for those local deals and see if I
can get the best price performance money
can buy
at least in Australia so this month
we've already landed an i7 4770k on
Facebook marketplace for 90 Aussie
dollars that's like somewhere around 65
u.s. dollars off the top of my head
absolute bargain now I couldn't call
this guy up because on Facebook
marketplace a lot of people just don't
give out their phone numbers so I had to
message him and he replied he said yes
but other than that on Facebook
marketplace there really isn't much else
available there's people selling gaming
pcs and other than that we're gonna jump
on gumtree right now and see if we can
find anything from graphics cards to
whole pcs so let's get into it
and find them deals
so the first deal were pulled up here is
a GTX 980 g1 gaming now apparently
they've reduced it from 250 ozzie to
$200 so we're gonna give them a call and
see if they'll take 180 pickup today
because this is the address that they've
got here is pretty much right on the way
to lairs and usually every month ago
check out what lasers got if he's got
any deals pulled aside for us so I'm
sort of making a rout of all the good
deals that would be able to be picked up
not too far out of my way but at the
same time would present a lot of value
with this trip that we're gonna make to
Brisbane anyway alright so there's no
answer there we're just gonna drop the
offer in on gumtree itself and also
we'll just send them a text message
next up here we've got a seller who's
got two I 5 op duplexes for sale one
with a gigabytes of RAM another with 4
gigabytes of RAM both got 500 you buy
hard drives so we offer a hundred flat
on the first one and also on the next
180 bucks that way we can get value out
of these machines if he accepts so we
get two machines for $180 dollars and it
might be pretty good value at those
price points so now the next three deals
we've got up here are all in the same
area so if we can land all three of
these for a decent price then I will go
pick all of them up but if it's just one
of the deals that I get then I might
cancel it but the first of these three
deals that I've pulled up here is an i5
desktop package so it's a lot over a
ThinkCentre with a keyboard mouse and
monitor
they're asking 150 if we can drop it
down to 120 and it's an ATX version not
a BTX version then we should have a good
deal on our hands hi mate is this that
computer dude right you must see you got
a load of om 72 here for a hundred and
fifty bucks a package yeah if I came
through today and picked it up could you
do us 120
I'm not actually I'm in co-op log but um
yeah now I probably didn't do that chase
it okay yeah yeah I know mate just just
saying if you want to get rid of it or
not but yeah I was just wondering - is
it a BT X version or an ATX version okay
no worries oh yeah mate if you keen on
the offer just let us know you got my
number so thanks mate wait so they're
pretty firm on one hundred and fifty
bucks
the thing is like I'm pretty sure I can
get a better deal off less so we'll go
check that out later and of course with
less I can get a lot more in box so yeah
it's up to him sometimes you don't
strike a deal and that's just what
hustling is all about next up we've got
a gtx 780 Ti here the guys out in Mogul
which is around the same area as that
desktop PC but my sister does live close
so if he does accept a 110 dollar offer
on the 780ti then I'll just get her to
pick it up and when I meet her next I'll
just collect it because yeah this day
just kind of like not looking like this
trip out that way will be worth it
unless of course we can get the next
deal here which is a gtx 970 and there
are a hundred twenty-five dollars but
we're gonna try and drop in an offer of
a hundred dollars and yeah if that works
out and we've got ourselves a really
good deal on a 970
the person you are calling is not
available hello is this Bray yeah man I
see you've got a GTX 970 here on gumtree
right yeah still available or yeah would
you would you take a hundred cash pickup
I know eyes made uh if you got me number
here just give us a call back in our
life you can just let us know guys I'm
going up to Brisbane that way today so
I'm gonna be doing the rounds man so let
us know if you're keen on it and I'll
come through and get it right yeah no
worries
thank you but a possibility that who
knows I'll get back to you guys
if we land that deal and also if the GTX
780 Ti gets back to us - but with that
said we're gonna go up to now see less
in Brisbane anyway since it's midday and
I want to beat traffic because around
about 4 p.m. here where I live traffic
just gets super chock-a-block so I want
to make all the rounds and get back here
before traffic gets crazy and on top of
that I've got some faulty stuff that I
actually have to return to Liz got a
faulty monitor some faulty memory as
well as a faulty motherboard so let's
just jump in the yes 'mobile and then
get up there and see what les has got
for us
try the intervention rain and it is
crazy like it's actually really bad
I'm actually not driving Shannon is
behind the wheel here basically guys
the 980 guy got back to me and he said
he would take 180 and he's right Niall
is too so we're gonna go pick that up
right now and this is gonna be a good
month
haan haan already
so we just finished up picking up two
really hot deals we got the 4770k for 90
Ozzy this gtx 980 g1 gaming which is
pretty much one of the best 980 s you
can get for a hundred and eighty Ozzy so
this month is already looking so damn
good
but of course less is just gonna sweeten
the deal with us picking up hopefully a
heap of OEMs but on that note it's so
ironic because yesterday I made a video
about use vs. new market and it's that
video what I said in that video which is
gonna be released after this video so
it's a little bit weird but what I said
in that video is just so much like a
hundred percent valid for what I'm doing
here today with the used parts hunt so
it's funny
so we just got back the traffic was
crazy and the deals here so far the best
deals on the table gtx 980 g1 gaming 180
Ozzy 4770k we got this for $90 that's
such a good deal and these guys were
really close to each other like this guy
I picked us up first and then went got
this and they about five minutes apart
and then lasers was only like ten
minutes away after that so it was really
good how all these deals were close to
each other even though I'm about a
50-minute drive up the highway to get to
the first point of contact so I'll super
happy about that but the guys with the
GTX 970 never got back to me and then of
course that guy with the desktop package
he wouldn't let it go any cheaper but
the guy with the 780ti did get back to
us and said he would accept 110 Aussie
dollars and since he's right around the
corner from my sister I might just get
her to pick it up and when I see you
next month then I can just give her the
money and just get that graphics card
from her so that'll be really easy and
that looks like it's a deal that's in
the kitty and then for Less we went and
saw him and he replaced the samsung
monitor the faulty one with this one
right here and he also replaced some
faulty dim sticks with some of these
right here but then some of the other
deals I ended up getting off him was an
i-5 2400 package here with I think is 4
gigabytes RAM and 500gb hard drive for
$100 $1 and the reason he did me this
one a little bit cheaper was because it
had some scuffed damage on it so he
couldn't sell it as an office PC or
anything like that and then he had an i5
3470 PC with 4 gigabytes of RAM and
500gb hard drive and he did this for a
hundred and twenty-five ozzie dollars as
well so that was really good so far and
then to top that off he threw in two
monitors here for 50 Ozzie dollars so a
22 inch Dell and also a 19 inch Dell
monitor as well so that's two monitors
and two pcs for I think off the top of
my head
275 dollars Ozzie which would make it a
lot cheaper in u.s. so so far this parts
hunt is looking really good but for some
reason I still have a little bit of an
itch to scratch where I need to get some
more deals I don't know if I'm
completely satisfied because you guys
are gotta let us know in the comments
below do you think these Toula No
those were good or do you think they
were learn know goes so going into last
night I was looking for some deals and I
found a GTX 670 and I offered them 40
Aussie dollars so they were asking for
50 I said 40 they said sure but they'll
busy yesterday so I can check it out
today and hopefully go pick that up and
that's really good news because I do
have a 79 50 that I got for $40 as well
and it's 2019 so I can see a really cool
video coming from that very soon for you
guys but also there's a case and power
suppliers it's pretty mediocre but they
wanted $50 for alpha 30 and of course
the power supply alone goes brand-new
for I think over $40 so that's gonna be
a pretty good case and power supply for
a budget build and then lastly I went
and offered $30 for a Coolermaster
cosmos case so hopefully that gets
through we will update later because
there's a couple of things I want to
talk to you guys about right now about
the market so looking around at used
parts and also new parts where I did a
video on dedicated deals towards Ozzie's
for new parts it is clearly like now is
such a good time to be building a PC
because the prices of parts have come
down to the point where they're just
some of the best deals I've ever seen
and if we contrast this to last year
when we had the cryptocurrency boom I
think it's just a balance where last
year you had it was way out of whack it
was way out of balance over the top this
time it's sort of pulling back in the
other way where it's kind of I feel
under where it should be so it's a great
time to pick up new parts use parts are
we making a dedicated video towards that
however but the one thing is we've seen
here today is I know a lot of you guys
already follow it but it's the code of
discipline do not get emotionally
attached to any of the deals you only
get it I mean in my opinion should only
get emotionally attached to people that
show you emotions that's family friends
loved animals and that stuff but when it
comes to these deals it's just a product
it's just offer a price if the guy says
no if they know you in the cases we saw
today then just forget about it I mean
the guy got back to me about one of the
pcs and he said look would you take 85
and I'm like no because it's a Dell
motherboard it's gonna be completely
useless I'm gonna be able to utilize
that thing
in another build so I got better deals
off less in my opinion so I left that
one sitting there there was also that
desktop package out of the way and also
that GTX 970 where I've really said in
the past you can get an RX 574 gigabyte
for cheaper and I think it's actually
gonna perform better than a 970 or they
may be roughly the same but anyway $100
vs. is 125 dollars I know which one I'm
gonna be taking personally anyway guys I
satisfy my used parts addiction and go
pick up those PC parts
so just got back now from getting the
next round of deals and this is the GTX
670 we've got this 440 huzi dollars I
think that's a brown about 30 USD so
that's really great for the comparison
between that and the old-school 7950
can't wait to bring that to you guys
behind that is three rx5 70's pick them
up off king of the coast on the way back
and he still had some I was like you
know can i pick three of these up he's
like sure
so got them for a hundred and ten Aussie
dollars each and then we've got here
this is that case and power supply combo
that we picked up so 30 Ozzie dollars
not bad I mean this is sort of just have
to put that back had a DVD Drive and
inside it's got a one of those thermal
tape power supplies that retail for like
forty five dollars I think so again the
values pretty good there so overall we
have a lot of different parts here on
the table that I am happy with I'll
tally up the whole haul and let you guys
know the prices right here just a little
bit late at the moment I'm a little bit
tired can't do math too well but let's
sit down and also recap this month's
parts on and now here we are closing up
this month of March 2019 with an
absolute victory but it's not only a
victory in the used past it's also a
massive victory in my opinion for new
parts as well as we saw with those eBay
deals for Aziz even in the US this 8
cores going really cheap and on eBay in
America at the moment there's things
like rx for 80s going for ridiculously
cheap like 70 US dollars or something
like that so there is so many good deals
to be had right now if you're waiting to
get on the latest rise in 3000 series
then that's amazing like if you're
looking for that best performance from
AMD but if you're just looking to get
into gaming at the moment then you can
just get into gaming really cheap if you
want even want to get new parts or you
want to get used parts it is just the
era it is back ladies and gentlemen it
is back it is time to be building a PC
because the value is just there I mean
look at that 4770k I haven't seen a
4770k go that cheap ever and
pick one up 490 Aussie dollars GTX 980
180 bucks and it's like one of the best
gtx 980 you can get i got a case i got
some lenovo is there I've got some
monitors it is just great time I'm just
loving this month it's been one of the
most fun months to do of course I had a
bit of an addiction I guess I had some
budget left over and I wanted to clean
up some more parts and I even managed to
do that just with a quick hustle last
night then went picked those parts up
today but also to top everything off I
got my sister to go pick up the GTX 780
Ti classified they got that for a
hundred and ten Aussie dollars that is
just one of the best 7080 eyes you can
get as well that's gonna go really well
in a gaming PC so I'm looking forward to
putting together some awesome used
Christ performers for you guys with all
that aside I hope you guys have been
enjoying this month's use parts hunt if
you did then be sure to hit that like
button also let us know below in the
comments what was your favorite deal off
today love reading them thoughts and
opinions and I'll catch you guys in
another tech video very soon
peace out for now bye
