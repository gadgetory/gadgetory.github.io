asrock have done with this B 365 and
motherboard they've put RGB LEDs
underneath the board I'm pretty sure
that alone is going to drop the RM
temperatures and also flatten out any
mishaps in the frequency response curves
with the audio hope you're doing well
out there wherever you are in the world
right here we've got the b-36 5m phantom
gaming for motherboard from asrock now
straight away you probably wondering
what are the differences between B 360
and b-36 5 well the first one is this
one uses the Cabul 8 platform chipset
hub just like the z3 70 they're using 22
nanometer here the B 360 actually uses
the 14 nanometer chipset hub the main
difference being USB 3.1 gen2 be 365
versus the B 360 which has USB 3.1 gen2
but that out of the way we've got here
this board which I'm going to be testing
putting a 9900 K through it which who
even knows if it's intended to have a
9900 k run through it stressing this vrm
giving you guys the whole circle tour of
a tech yet city motherboard review we
may be testing this heatsink out we're
gonna be testing the USB 3 speeds out
can be testing the onboard audio and of
course seeing if this VRM can handle the
heat let's get on with the show
so running through this motherboards
physical attributes we have what asrock
claims is a 10 phase vrm which I'm
guessing is six plus two plus one plus
one with six phases being dedicated
towards the CPU now for the chokes
they're using magic 45 amp chokes them
for the caps we've got 12 K nichkhun
caps and then for the MOSFETs so high
side first we've got the PZ 0 9 0 3 BK
and then for the low side we got the PK
6 1 8 a now I can't find any details on
these MOSFETs there's nothing out there
in the wild before the PWM controller
they're using the UPI u p9 5 - 1 P and
then move through the rest of this board
we've got 3 m dot 2 slots one of those
being dedicated for Wi-Fi the other two
being dedicated for nvme drives which
they both individually have PCIe gen3 x4
speeds but together in raid 0 1 they do
drop down to PCIe gen 2 moving over to
the back of the board we've got USB 3.1
type-a for connections a USB type-c and
then at the top we've got USB 2 2 of
those and a ps2 port as well as a HDMI
IN a DisplayPort 1.2 and then for the
NIC we've got an Intel I - 1 9 V 1
gigabit per second solution and then
below that we've got manual 5.1 analog
surround out as well as an optical out
powered by the realtek 1200 so not the
real tech 12:20 that you may be used to
seeing going back to the board however
I've got three PCIe standard slots the
top one being a 16x slot below that
we've got a 1x then below that we've got
a 16x style but this actually truly only
supports x4 speeds and then lastly we've
got 6 SATA 3 native ports four dimm
slots as well as a 12 volt single RGB
out header and 2 5 volt addressable RGB
headers on the side here one of those
being tall one of those being sideways
right beside the smooth cutout on the
PCB here which has an invert and says
phantom gaming on it with RGB underneath
as well as getting RGB underneath the
top heatsink here but with all that
aside let's whack this thing on the test
bench and see if we can make it flip out
with the 9900 kay
this is the first time booting it up
without going into the BIOS and we can
see here that the CPU initially started
out going out to about a hundred and
fifty-five whites with the auto default
four point seven gigahertz I think on
all cores and then it drops down to
ninety five watts and essentially
there's no throttling going on so the
CPU is under control but the actual
board itself did throttle down to around
four to four point one gigahertz here so
we're gonna go into the BIOS and see if
we can change some of the power limit
settings see if we can alleviate this
because I do want to run it for a good
ten minutes and see if it can pass the
stress test with out-of-the-box settings
for the ninety nine hundred K so now in
the asrock boss and we're gonna try and
change a few settings to keep that limit
up there on the ninety nine hundred K
and so basically what we do is we hit f6
and we go into the Advanced Settings
here and the as work settings are really
good for basic or advanced on this B 365
it looks like you get all the Advanced
Options - a couple of limitations on the
B 360 chipset we'll talk about that
pretty soon the first thing we want to
go into is the overclocking tweaking tab
and into CPU configuration here just to
up those power limits that you may have
seen plaguing some of the reviews when
the 9,900 k was first released so if we
hit in 5000 on all those it should just
max them out as well as the long power
duration limit so that should
essentially up the limits on the CPU
here so we don't throttle then we move
into DRAM configuration and we have no
option for XMP profiles which I'm not
sure if that's a limitation on the be
365 chipset but regardless asrock do
have a great feature here called the
DRAM tweak and now we go in here and we
can suddenly see that all our XMP
profiles and all the profiles saved into
this memory are essentially available
and so what we can do is we can select
the memory up here and then go over here
to the XMP and select them all and that
will essentially lock in all the
settings for that stick and then we can
go to the next stick in the slot and do
the exact same thing and lock all those
XMP settings in manually sort of
bypassing any limitations on the board
itself and so we click OK and that will
lock all our settings in some other
useful features on this motherboard
include the ability to control RGB it's
called the polychrome RGB and you
control this from the BIOS as well as
all the options connected to the actual
motherboard itself and then you've also
got one thing that I really like about
the al-zahraa boards in the bass is the
ability to flash the BIOS through
internet flash now I did have a
pre-release boss here and it didn't
support the Corsair memory but after
quickly using the internet flash I
updated to the retail release and now my
vengeance Pro memory is working fine
you've also got hardware monitor
fantastic tuning we can control all the
different fan headers on the board where
in this case there is five fan headers
included on this motherboard which is
good for a mid-range motherboard and you
can set them custom if you wish to or
you can just have them full blast if
your fans are quiet so after that we can
just go to either back to easy mode or
back to advanced mode and save &amp;amp; exit'
these changes all before that if we wish
to save this into a profile and
overclock Tweaker and then go down to
overclock Tweaker and just call it max
limit 9900 K and that way I know this is
ready to go
so now we've been testing out the CPU
the 900k good news is it goes to 4.6
gigahertz on the b-36 5m phantom gaming
4 however it does throttle without a fan
over the vrm so we were getting as we
can see with the lineup over here
without the fan on it throttles after
about a minute and 50 seconds in with
the fan on it's just been going
absolutely fine keeping that CPU
absolutely stable and we did get the
FLIR one temperatures over it and so
it's about 75 degrees with the fan on
there and this is in the middle of
summer so we're talking 27 degrees
ambient in this room right now so it
does get pretty damn hot where I am at
the moment so it is kind of like a
worst-case scenario for this motherboard
but besides that it's doing an okay job
but if you do want to run a 9900 kayoed
suggest getting some sort of cooling
over the BRM because we saw here without
the actual fan on it it does throttle
pretty quickly and so things do heat up
on the VR and pretty quickly and it will
throttle the CPU down to about 4
gigahertz
if this happens so besides the vrm there
are a lot of other features that we will
want to test out with this motherboard
for instance the USB 3 speeds are
absolutely fine giving my Kingston USB
Drive over 300 megabytes per second the
NIC speeds file transfer test that was
fine too but what about the audio with
the realtek 1200 series here we test it
out with a manual sweep test and found
the frequency response curve to be solid
not the best i've seen but still solid
nonetheless we've got a 4 decibel
roll-off with 10 Hertz to 0 Hertz and
then 10 to 20 Hertz we've got I think
like a point one decibel roll-off so
very impressive there moving through the
rest of the frequency after 1k we do see
a slight wave I did have to go retest
this but the retest did confirm what I
was seeing the first time around and
that was it's slightly shaky after 1k
not in a bad ways you can see the line
that is pretty smooth but regardless
it's not as good as what I've seen in
the past looking at the crosstalk levels
these are phenomenally good we're
looking at negative 80 to 85 decibels on
each Channel
and the good thing is they've finally
fixed the crosstalk problem we're over
90 it'll leak from the left channel to
the right channel there was no leaking
whatsoever all the way up to a volume
level of 100 and then for the mic import
it looks like they've gone away with
noise suppression so plus 30 DB a
hundred volume will introduce noise same
with plus 20 DB and a hundred volume so
the sweet spot for this motherboard with
the mic input is plus 20 TB 50 volume
level and that will give you relatively
no noise your friends will be able to
hear you in games really well but the
breakdown with audio here is if you've
got budget audio gear like a budget
headphone or headset and a budget
microphone this board will do absolutely
fine however if you are an audiophile
and you do have high quality equipment
you may wish to step it up to a
dedicated a cam solution now for the m2
nvme slots I tested them out the speeds
were absolutely fine and the heatsink
itself I am glad to say it does work
properly the software reported 50
degrees and then after we put the
heatsink on we got 45 degrees after
about 20 minutes of stress testing on
the hardware side we went from 65
degrees down to 43 degrees but it is
important to note that the heatsink is
blocking the actual chip that we read
before and then the final test I wanted
to run here was Cinebench where it
looked like it was getting 4.7 gigahertz
constant and then on the single core
boosts they were reporting they were
going up to 4.9 gigahertz during that
single thread test and then running over
to a game like Resident Evil 2 we could
see the clock speeds fluctuating between
4.6 and 4.7 gigahertz so it does look
like asrock are implementing features at
the BIOS level to be able to break a 4.6
gigahertz limit and push it to 4.7 and
even 4.9 on the single called boost
speeds so now we're conclusion time with
the be 365 M phantom gaming for
motherboard what do I think of it well
for starters the chipset itself be 365
I'm not impressed like at all with this
chipset but I think asrock have done a
good job in implementing a solid
all-round motherboard the audio checks
out the neck the USB 3 speeds the
features PCIe gen two but the heatsink
that works and then the VR M if you add
a fan to it and keep in mind this is a
9900
okay it's a $500 CPU and a stray it's
around 800 AUD and this motherboard is
going to cost around 80 to 90 US dollars
and in Australia I'm guessing around 130
Aussie and so it's going to be very
budget orientated but still be able to
get up and boogie if you get a couple of
with an 8700 K or a 9700 K or an 8700
you're gonna have absolutely no problems
whatsoever if you do for some odd reason
one a couple of with a ninety nine
hundred K then definitely think about
getting a fan over that vrm we saw the
temperatures drop from a hundred and ten
degrees all the way down to 75 degrees
with that fan that's a massive drop not
just for keeping your CPU from
throttling but also for longevity if you
wish to keep your vrm cool and have it
running for a very long time and the
last thing that impressed me about this
motherboard was the BIOS it's actually
the same fully featured BIOS as their
higher-end motherboards except of course
you've got that ddr4 memory limitation
there were two thousand six hundred and
sixty-six megahertz
however as well still offer the DRAM
Tweaker which will enable you to get the
most out of your memory in terms of sub
timings and also speeds and you can
still from then it may be lower the
timings a little bit more to extract the
best out of ddr4 memory as well as
having the RGB control in the BIOS
itself and that fantastic tuning for
making manual fan curve profiles anyway
guys let us know what you think of the
b-36 5 platform or pacifically though
let us know what you think of as rocks
implementation I think they've done a
decent job at the price point if you get
a couple with a ninety nine hundred K as
I said before do get a fan over that VRM
but if I guess if you putting a ninety
nine hundred K on any budget orientated
motherboard I would suggest putting a
fan over the VRM if you're going crazy
on the overclocks
