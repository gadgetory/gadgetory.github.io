dangers of white LEDs that's the LEDs
going in the back here monitors and the
amount of blue light they emit a lot of
my viewers asked me about a program
called flux and does it work and so
today I thought I'd run a quick ghetto
test for you guys and it shows that flux
does indeed work
I've been asked what do I think of flux
and I don't know like I've tried it and
I kind of liked the program however I'm
just going to go test it right now and
see if it does block out or does reduce
the blue light coming out of the monitor
and the good thing about this test is
even though it's like ghetto science it
will give you accurate results as we see
here because the camera is on the exact
same exposure in a controlled learning
environment and the monitor in the
background has a brightness control
which is independent of the OSD it
doesn't have an on-screen display and
the computer essentially can't control
the brightness directly on this monitor
so the brightness is maxed out you've
got that blue hinge reflecting off the
glasses there so what we're going to do
is we're going to now install flux and
we're going to put it to night time and
see how much that actual blue light goes
down or if it does go down at all so
let's have a look
so we've now installed flux on the
computer and I just decided to set it
somewhere in the middle of America I
think it's like 3:00 a.m. or something
so the color temperature is like down to
like 4,000 or unjust under that but
anyway I think it does actually make a
difference like you can see there the
difference between not having it
installed and installed you can see them
out of blue light coming off those
glasses is a lot less than it was in the
previous video like the actual previous
test with it without clocks installed so
flux does help like it does help you so
I can't recommend it so there you go and
anyways I don't think I need to do a
conclusion nuff said like flux works so
if you had to tell you those two parts
into the whole total I'd say they'd come
around just under five hundred dollars
and though for the performance in the
bang for buck it is certainly worth it
with this thing performing pretty much
better than a four core has well over
cloth and then seriously putting out six</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
