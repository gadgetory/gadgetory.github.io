the dark coming back to you guys today
with one of those reviews about the CNP
s 14 speed Zalman 140 millimeter fan CPU
cooler now this thing is a strong
strongly not recommended I do not
recommend this unless you got it given
to you for free even then the hassle and
the pain of installing this thing might
want might make you want to throw it in
the bin so anyway this thing I'm gonna
quickly be reviewing this because I just
don't want to spend too much time on it
literally I couldn't even be bothered
throwing up charts because I'm not gonna
recommend this cooler I'll just talk
about the temps that I got on this when
I was testing it when I was doing the
AMD testing on this test bench here but
ultimately let's talk about the
positives because there's so many
negatives to go through and there's so
little positives I'll quickly mention
the positives the first positive is that
the CPU cooler once it's installed after
you finally get it installed it actually
does look pretty good I mean it looks
pretty big it looks good
in your rig I do like the styling of it
the next good point is that it does cool
reasonably well I mean it's better than
the stock cooler for cooling performance
once I got it installed it was I did an
Ida sixty-four 30-minute benchmark and
it was a I think the ambient
temperatures were nine degrees I was
really cold but I only managed to get it
up to 29 degrees so it was a 20 degree
Delta at 4.4 gigs on the AMD CPU so it
is about 20 degrees and I did it test it
in the Zalman case but that's only for
five minutes we're gonna test it a
little bit more I was doing a fine job
at four point four gigs so it does cool
okay not as good as the animatics t 40 I
know that because then ni max to 40 is a
beast anyway this thing yeah there there
the two good points that I can think of
let's get on to the bad points straight
away the first thing is you're
installing this CPU cooler the fins are
really sharp so if you're a diabetic
with thin skin on your hands or your
hands cut easily you may be cutting your
hands on this thing it wasn't you know
my hands are okay but I just thought
damn you know even coolers ten years
back in the day like an old Knox you're
cool that I
my way back we're gonna what cpu cooler
I put it on back in 2006 maybe to that
five even that was fine I mean that
didn't have sharp edges this thing
really was just like cut like in the
factory you you you let's let's release
some ninja knives to people and call it
a CPU fan because essentially yeah you
cut your hands on this pretty easily I
think they're pretty sharp definitely a
lot sharper than the NMAC 40 and I'm
gonna be comparing this throughout the
review to the NMAC 40 because they're
similarly priced I mean this is about
this was about thirty dollars the Animax
was thirty dollars however it went up to
34 dollars and I thought hell I'll try a
new CPU cooler and I get to give you
guys a review as well but in hindsight I
wish I had never got this cooler man
like let's get on to the worst part was
installing this thing holy crap when I
got the instruction manuals out they
just clumped Intel AMD everything
together just clumped it all in one
section and you had to read the whole
thing and free-for-all it and then the
pictures were illustrating the
installations so bad there was just
there was no circle or no sort of there
was no sort of enlarged graph on what
point they were talking about they just
put the diagram in two parts and just
said okay and you just had to look
really closely and you're like oh
there's the subtle difference right
there like definitely if you if you if
your eyesight wasn't 20/20 you freaking
probably wouldn't even see the
difference in the instruction manual
that's how about poorly written the
instruction manual was for this thing
now let's get onto the other part of the
installation installing this thing was
just like a ghetto job because I had
mounted it to my test bench and I didn't
realize but once I took it out of my
test bench which took forever and got it
installed in the Zalman z3 plus I
realized that holy crap this CPU cooler
I mean they gave you this double-sided
tape and it came off and you couldn't
install it again it was just useless I
had to get some nail polish remover and
get it off because half of it came off
and half of it was stuck on the friggin
base still so I ended up I'm now using
it in the Zeeman zelmans III plus case
which is a fantastic case by the way but
I'm using that with just no double-sided
tape I just decided to leave it out I
mean why they
even included it if it was so bad it's
just beyond me they could have saved
themselves some money because you don't
even need the double-sided tape but
stupid there as well now the worst thing
this is the worst thing right when
you're installing it it's like you're
sitting there and you're like okay is
this right is this how I install it and
then you finally get it install once
you're clamping down the screws and they
pretty much clamp in but there's no
washer there's no bolt in between it's
just like this free ghetto spring
mechanism that they're using it's
absolutely horrid I've never seen
anything worse for clamping down a CPU
cooler in my life I mean even the stock
intel on the stock AMD cooled this clamp
down miles better than this thing and
that leads me on to the other bad point
about this cooler is it's so hard to
screw the fricken cooler in like once if
you need to take it out if you've just
got your whole rig installed and you've
got to maybe remove the CPU cooler
because you want to replace the CPU
paste or you want to tighten it down
again you literally are in fat luck
because you can't get this CPU cooler
clamped down again and which you know
and honestly it will inevitably come
loose because of the ghetto spring
mechanism pulling against the bolt
because there's no washer there's no
sort of tension bolt in between it's
just there's this spring well there's
this metal piece of metal that's pushing
against the bolt which over time it will
come loose and so if you want to pull it
and tighten it again you're gonna have
to take your whole rig out whole
motherboard out and then get to it with
their little lake ghetto screw thing and
yeah like literally this thing is just
horrid do not buy it I'm surprised that
in 2014 or two I don't know when this
reserve weighs maybe two last year 2013
I'm surprised they could release a cool
of this bad I mean did they test this
thing themselves before they sold it
because I mean yeah the the spring
tension is gonna be point and I couldn't
even get into the top-left corner when I
try to tighten them down again on
zelmans III click case I could tighten
three of them but I couldn't tighten the
top left corner was like impossible so
even if my baby even if I could have the
hands of the size of my baby
I couldn't install this cooler so
absolutely horrid point there what else
was just there and this is now let's get
on to another bad point about this case
so sorry I got to tell you guys why you
shouldn't be buying this freaking cooler
the noise it's just horrible they say
here on the back let's have a look here
low noise they say here low noise 140
millimeter p WM fan with nut low noise
let me play the noise for you right now
is that low noise to you man
I noticed it straight away coming from
my inner max T 42 this thing it was
horrid the noise was bad it was the
worst fan in my whole system and it
shouldn't be especially when the CPU
cooler is really cool they should have a
switching mechanism that goes from low
to high
where they right here on their box
conveniently no switching noise no
switching noise what switches on a CPU
cooler make no noise when my Animax
changes speeds the fan just simply ramps
up
so really god damn I mean Animax really
have to pay attention to detail because
this thing is hard ah and there's
another bad point let me talk about
another hard point of this cooler it
wobbles even if you tighten it to the
extreme which I did this thing just
wobbles it wobbles it wobbled on my test
bench it wobbled it's wobbling in the
zelmans III so they should have renamed
this cooler the Zalman CNP s 14 speed
wobble because it'll wobble for 10 times
harder than any CPU cooler you used to
so honestly yet I mean it come like a
little good point about it they do
include some thermal grease and stuff
like that but yeah I mean honestly I
cannot recommend this cooler it was just
a horrible experience okay so in
conclusion I cannot recommend this CPU
in any circumstances it was just a it
was the worst experience I've ever had
with the CPU cooler and this is going
back from memory even back when I was
installing CPU coolers in like 2005 and
I mean that that's what that was when
the market was still relatively young
that was when the CPU cooler
it was kind of just starting to get some
traction and getting popularity this
thing is like 2013 I don't even know
when was this thing released 2012 but I
mean modern CPU cool like this sucking
this bad is just not on like I mean it
really did not hit any points for me I
mean it did look good but hey for me
looks do not really matter on a rig I
mean I'm not sitting here looking at my
rig 24/7 I'm playing video games doing
content for you guys or working on my
computer so it looks really don't bother
me you know I'd rather have the ugliest
CPU cooler in the world that's a breeze
to install and performs really well then
have this thing which is a good-looking
CPU cooler with high noise and a horrid
installation and I even dread the day
when I'm gonna have to read 10 retighten
the bolts on my AMD ring so god I just
yet I cannot recommend this CPU cool on
any circumstances I hope you guys
enjoyed this review I mean I didn't
enjoy yeah I didn't this product was
just frustrating I didn't enjoy doing it
so I really want to just get on with
this get on to the next review so I'll
be reviewing an SSD soon and also I will
be you guys can say hello to the ghetto
highs as they're sitting there but
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and I'm gonna go now and peace out
and if you did like this video please
give it a thumbs up and if you have any
questions about this CPU cooler which I
don't think you should have
I just yet seriously don't don't buy it
let's just this is just one of those
things that you you know you don't talk
about you just you know one of those
embarrassing things you don't talk about
and you don't tell your kids about this
is that CPU cooler anyway guys peace out
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
