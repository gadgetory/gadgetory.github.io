so here's the mate ten huawei's latest
flagship phone er in this case sister
flagship phone dad although it may seem
shadowed by the mate 10 Pro it does have
some key differences that may at least
for me personally make it a better
option and we will quickly get those
differences out of the way with first it
has expandable microSD storage and it
has a headphone jack this is the big one
for me I don't want to carry around any
storage I do want to carry around any
extra USB adapters in my headphones
there all three point five notes and I
want to utilize that awesome onboard DAC
that comes on the mate 10 and talking
about the audio figures here they are
quite impressive this is one of the key
differences that not many talked about
that makes a huawei flagship quality low
crosstalk and great amp egde and
practically no base frequency roll-off
at all though further differences
between this and the pro model is that
this has an IPS 2k 16 by 9 screen versus
the pros 1080p 18 by 9 or 2 to 1 OLED
screen and also the pro is water dunk
proof first the mate 10 only being
splash resistant the pro also has 6
gigabytes of ram verse 4 gigabytes of
RAM and 128 gigabytes of on-board
storage versus 64 gigabytes of on-board
storage with the mate 10 non-pro however
boring stuff aside let's talk about what
makes this phone an absolute winner 4000
mAh battery lasts a long time I got two
and a half days of normal usage out of
this thing first my p9 which usually
only goes for a day and a half at best
not only that it charges up in an
impressive 1 hour and 20 minutes with
the included charger hardware wise it
has a cure in 970 which is a big leap
over the previous keren 960 with an 8
core CPU and a dedicated neural
processing unit which Huawei calls the
MP u which helps process things like
facial recognition imaging and cloudy
eye syncing it is a great addition that
only has just been released to the
smartphones this year the Marley G 7212
cord GPU
also helps give out a great gaming
experience with it winning the GFX
benchmark and also scoring right around
other Android flagships in Geekbench
the Huawei phones themselves also
incorporate smart machine learning and
this is something that has impressed me
over the years using Huawei phones they
never seem to slow down and now after
reading through the fine print I've
realized that it is this exact algorithm
that keeps your everyday toss indexed
and your files that you never seem to
open anymore
tucked away allowing the phone to remain
fast and snappy though comparing a spec
wise to other phones out there it has
similar resolution in RAM as a galaxy si
plus as well as the LG v 30 yet comes in
quite a bit less for the money though
the one plus five is still under cutting
all the phones mention here for the raw
specs for the money
bill quality wise you get an all metal
frame surrounded by reinforced glass
measuring it at 150 mil long by 78
millimeters wide by eight point two
millimeters thick the build quality is
phenomenal though you will fingerprint
this thing quite easily the may 10 also
includes a pre attach spring protector
and a rubbery carry case other
accessories include earbuds which
include a mic and it's surprisingly
really good though of course not
anything near your audiophile headphone
level though how about the screen itself
well it is an IPS panel with a 60 Hertz
refresh rate and has three resolution
settings 720p 1080p and 2k I honestly
couldn't tell the difference between the
1080p and 2k setting though 720p did
feel slightly pixelated though whatever
the reason the 1080p setting must be
being upscale to 2k and this setting
will enable you to have more battery
life and more frames on heavy demanding
games for example then the higher to
code native resolution setting the one
thing I love about the screen itself is
that 16 by 9 ratio most smartphones
carry the 18 by 9 ratio so watching
movies on this phone was a really
pleasant experience now under probably
the biggest talking point of this phone
the camera or should I say cameras it
has two rear cameras one with 12
megapixels RGB sensor and another with
20 megapixels monochrome sensor one
provides image stabilization and the
other provides more detail and clarity
at nighttime the F value stops down to F
1.6 and is quite simply exceptional to
shoot with this camera the forks pocket
type effect really shines out thanks to
the dual cameras and the settings are
very easy to navigate with easy options
to choose from
or the ability to enter the pro mode
where you can gain manual control to get
the show
you need though this promo does an
extender video which I'd like to see in
a future update and video shooting
supporting goes all the way up to 4k
30fps or 1080p 60fps though after 1080p
30fps you do lose inbuilt image
stabilization that there is still
optical image stabilization available on
all modes and other big pluses that the
inbuilt image stabilization does work
quite well and surprisingly the night
time video shooting is really good to
beating that of my 4k vlog camera which
costs a similar price but of course the
vlog camera does have a better autofocus
and does have 25 X optical zoom the
front-facing camera aka selfie camera
with an 8 megapixel sensor and an F 2.0
stopping value it also has the beauty
filter on by default something I turn
off so you can see my wrinkles coming
through and all their glory though of
course the last part to touch on with
the cameras themselves is the extremely
close focus distance for macro shooting
I measured around 7 centimeters of
distance which is extremely good for
getting the macro shot you want if you
need to digital zoom expenses to two
times as well with what Huawei promises
is at the expense of no loss in quality
you can be the judge of that and the
links will be in the description below
and onto another highlight of this phone
the user interface and the ease of use
the mate 10 comes pre-installed with the
latest Android update nicknamed Oreo and
it looks absolutely gorgeous in my
opinion with the emu i overlay imposed
by Huawei some may think it's a little
bit too much especially Android barebone
users but for me personally it is what
makes the Huawei phone one that is just
so damn good for instance all the apps
that I need to use quite simply work
Google Maps never cuts out on me
something that can't be said for the
Sami phone that I had come through here
and the May 10 goes behind the code to
ask me things like if I want to resize
photos before I email them and this is
extremely convenient if I'm taking snaps
for gum tree and I need a downsize on
the fly
also scrolling around and accessing
features is just a blast I never have
any programs crashing on me nor do I
have any text slowdowns something that
has happened on previous phones before I
started using Huawei and hence why I
have continued to use their phones over
the last few years starting with the
ascend g6
the P 9 and now
made 10 so funny enough my reason for
staying on the Huawei line despite this
phone being sent in as a sample for a
review is one that could be described as
a pleasant surprise
I bought the g6 sim-free over two years
ago when it was priced at about 150 USD
and at that price I really just expected
something that could post a few tweets
take some phone calls and maybe snap
some potato photos for Instagram but
what I got was so much more something
that was really damn good has great
onboard audio for listening
with headphones and ultimately it was a
phone that punched so hard for the money
that you paid and it was ever since then
that I've been a real believer in the
Huawei lineup of phones things just work
they don't slow down and they work
exceptionally well great for someone
looking for value for money my p9 has
also been dropped so many times that I
am now on the second crack screen but it
still keeps going and has no signs of
slowing down
so it doesn't surprise me to see that
Huawei is now outselling Apple in 2017
and only has Samsung to go to get to the
number one spot
lastly the may 10 also has dual SIM
support with the option to select data
from one sim and use the line from the
other great for international travelling
where international data rates on only
one sim would otherwise ruin you
completely or not being able to take a
call while using local data sim could
also ruin you as well the phone itself
can connect up to any computer via the
USB C to standard USB a cable which
comes included and doesn't thank the
heavens need any sync software to be
pre-installed you can simply drag and
drop files in and out of the box you can
even watch MKV movie files and listen to
dot FLAC files without installing any
additional apps so the may 10 here has
practically everything I could ask for
in a smart phone and price at eight
hundred and eighty dollars a strain or
at least that's what the guy at JB hi-fi
city could do it for me it was quite
well priced for Z's as for folks in the
UK it is rumored to be released soon for
around about seven hundred pounds and if
you're in the United States and I
believe CES they may be having an
official launch date in America though
nothing's really knowing yet in terms of
pricing though ultimately for the price
Huawei is asking it does carry a metal
frame Oreo update dual SIM headphone
jack microSD slot 2k resolution support
on 60fps 2k screen 16 by 9 ratio 4000
mAh battery super quick charge
one hour and 20 minutes a core CPU 12
core GPU and a newer processor chip
built-in and damn after all that I have
myself a new favorite smartphone here on
my hands and keep in mind I'd love to
see this smartphone with an OLED display
that would be about my only critique
personally though in the may tends
defense it does come in cheaper than the
competitors flagship phones and although
it is splash resistant it isn't water
dunk proof if you need weather proofing
you might want to take a look at some
other phones or the mate 10 pro and
lastly I believe it doesn't support
wireless charging 2 though besides that
an exceptional phone and yes I am gonna
say this review will incorporate some
personal bias but that's something that
comes with having a flawless experience
for the last few years and then being
throw into the high-end after having
been so satisfied with the mid and low
end products anyway guys hope you
