lot of buzz around the unit's being one
of the best value for money CPUs out
there today I'm going to test it against
the i3 6100 with some Apple to Apple
cpu-bound loving tests and of course
throw in some extra games on top of the
benchmarks that I did in the recent
build video welcome back guys today I'm
talking about the i3 60 100 which is the
same user cost around one hundred and
ten dollars and comparing it to the new
pentium g 45 60 which costs around $64
funny thing is though the cpu only cost
munich 78 Australian dollars which
converted would be around 58 USD and
that was with ten percent tax on it
anyway it is a very inexpensive CPU that
features two cores and four threads just
like the i3 6100 however major
differences are that it is co-opted two
hundred megahertz lower doesn't carry
the AVX instruction set which doesn't
affect game is at all and it has HD 610
graphics as opposed to the i3 which has
HD 530 graphics and of comparing it to
the i3 7100 that has HD 630 graphics so
with that said let's benchmark some
games and take a look at some quick
apples to apples cpu-bound test to see
the worst case scenario between these
two CPUs
so there it is guys in a worst case
scenario you would expect this CPU to
perform at worth five percent lower than
the i3 6100 in the real world it would
be even less than that and since the i3
is near double the price it is a
difference it certainly can be ignored
for gamers on a budget also when turning
up the settings with the RX 470 at 1080p
on top of the other games that I tested
in these 470 dollar budget bills video
which I'll leave a link in the
description below the G 45 60 performed
extremely well and even in battlefield 1
multiplayer you can see that this thing
is just smooth as butter csgo fans will
also be delighted to hear this CPU
pushes well into the 200 FPS mark at
1080p high settings - as the temps I was
actually testing this in plus 30 degree
ambient temperature and the CPU was a
stock cooler and paste was hovering
around 60 degrees Celsius mark so it has
a lot more Headroom for temperatures
everybody that's about all there is to
it really damn awesome CPU for the money
especially for people coming into PC
gaming and if it's your first PC then
it's going to be a really hard CPU to
beat especially was then around the
corner I mean that's going to definitely
bring some competition to the market but
in terms of a sub $100 CPU I don't see
it honestly getting a lot better than
the G 45 60 I mean AMD could definitely
beat out the G 45 60 but even then I
don't think it would be by a lot if they
did and also on that note you can couple
the G 45 60 with a really cheap H 110 be
150 or be 250 motherboard however if you
are coupling it with a 100 series board
keep in mind that you will need to
update the boss first or in other words
you will need to have access to a
skylake CPU or purchase the board from a
store that can pre flash the motherboard
for you before you can use the G 4560 on
it anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this
video and let me know in the comments
section below what you think about the G
4560 would love being your comments and
thoughts and opinions as always and I'll
catch you in another tech video very
soon peace out for now boy
