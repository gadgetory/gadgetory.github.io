on the Tuesday for Intel where they
announced their new tenth generation
sunny Cove architecture codenamed ice
Lake and the details behind this was
they'll promising an 18% IPC increase
compared to a previous generation Intel
processor before we continue I will say
this video is sponsored by Intel but on
the back of announcing their 10th gen
architecture the true intentions of
Intel came to light when they announced
project Athena 1.0 and this essentially
focuses on battery life but also having
the power and responsiveness on all
small form-factor laptops here they're
essentially promising Core i5 and i7
models with up to 4 cores and 8 threads
turbo up to 4 point 1 gigahertz there's
also the initiative power savings itself
when the computer goes to sleep it's in
a sleep state that uses little to no
power and then on top of that as soon as
you hit a key or open the lid it's ready
to go back into where you left that
state under devices coming out of this
project Athena they are promising up to
2 fold the graphics performance where
they'll displaying a destiny to demo on
an XPS 13 laptop running with 10th gen
and the frame rates were indeed smooth
this was the iris pro graphics with up
to 64 execution units on board another
thing with the 10th gen CPUs is that
they're integrating Thunderbolt 3 onto
the die itself and introducing Wi-Fi 6
chips which are not only smaller and use
less power than the predecessors but are
also a lot faster allowing one gigabit
internet connection transfers off this
Wi-Fi device now the form factor an
interaction is a big focus here to
offering ultra slim - and one clam shell
type laptops as well as 12 to 15 inch at
1080p or better with touch displays
they've also got narrow bezels on all
models coming out under a project Athena
and backlit keyboards and precision
touch pads with pen support now I did
manage to see the XPS 13 on display with
a 10th Jensi PU inside and it was indeed
very responsive also in terms of ice
Lake and performance boost they are
focusing on AI and now we did see the
holo set demo on display in the Intel
showroom
and that was showing that you can
integrate essentially video other Skype
calls and other video games into a whole
professional set that you can then use
for streaming with a new tech device
this is the same company that allows for
broadcasting for professional television
and they're now integrating that
technology in conjunction with intel on
these 10th gen laptops now the AI itself
is getting a 2.5 x boost and they were
showing off some cool technology like
active voice cancellation in the
background of the person calling you so
you don't have to worry about having
noise canceling in your headphones for
example if you're on a Skype
conversation because it will identify
those noises in the background and then
cancel amount in tandem
but the key player here is the Jenna
Levin graphics they've got some big
changes allowing for 4k 6 th dr natively
and billions of colors running off the
meteor engine this is roughly 2 times
faster than the previous generation and
it can still play games whilst only
using up to 15 watts of power this is on
the iris pro graphics with up to 64
execution units available
now besides project Athena in terms of
isolate there will be 11 new SKUs
ranging from the i3 series up to the i7
with again that same four core 8
threaded count with over 4 gigahertz of
max frequency the new obtained solutions
were also announced this is the m15
drives which can then couple with a 2
terabyte 5400 RPM drive for example and
give you faster speeds but also giving
you a lot of storage and especially if
you're using a program like Premiere Pro
all the time or playing your favorite
video game a lot this will help with
those load times significantly though
lastly I did go through the showroom
floor and saw some laptops from the Zeus
HP Lenovo Dell and also Acer and they
were showing off some creator pcs and in
the case of a Zeus they had the Zen Book
Pro which had two screens and this was
pretty incredible because you can
multitask while you're on the go and I
think this really states intel's
initiative coming out of Computex and
that is focusing on mobile performance
where on the desktop side they had the
ninth generation CPUs the 9900 KS and
some motherboard manufacturers like
asrock for example have refreshed some
z3 90s recently but that promises turbo
speeds up to 5 gigahertz on all cores
and now will be released later this year
too
you guys without a sight I hope you
enjoyed today's video if you did then be
sure to hit that like button for us also
let us know in the comment section below
what you think of the new ice Lake CPUs
as well as project Athena and the new
mobile creator pcs are you digging some
of these designs or are you not love
reading your thoughts and opinions as
always and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
