which was a case that looked pretty good
however the airflow wasn't all too good
and that also wasn't the only thing that
dropped as well
gamers Nexus dropped a tombstone on this
particular case however fast forward to
2018 they've now gone back and
redesigned this case and they've put a
mesh front panel on it and so today
we're gonna be dropping in a lot of
different hardware at 2080 TI and also a
9900 k and they're both gonna be
overclocked and we're gonna see if this
case can literally handle the heat so
let's put this $3,700 PC together and if
you're in Australian dollars and torture
test the Enzo mesh
so during this build come into a little
bit of a problem I guess you could call
it that and that is that the radiator
won't mount up the top now we are using
a 360 mil wrap but even if you were
using a 240 ml rad you still couldn't
fit it in here dude oh I'm not having
enough space to fit both the radiator
and the fan without hitting your heat
sink up the top so we're going to fit it
at the front and it does support a 360
mil rad absolutely a-okay
so here we are now with the Virgin we've
been running this for over 20 minutes
and it's pretty good I mean we're going
to hardware monitor and the temperatures
are about 97 degrees max so that's what
the region at the front here with the
three fans mounted likewise and it's
actually 28 degrees and being in here at
the moment so when I did this on the
open air test bed it was a 25 degrees
ambient so it's only one degree hotter I
think this in my tests the CPU came in
at 93 degrees so this is doing a very
good job of not making sure anything
overheats and especially this is the 99
hundred K it's looking like it's really
good so far however the only thing to do
now is to load up games and then let
this 20 atti here drop a heap of heat in
the case and see if the CPU and the GPU
together will cause problems for the
little Enzo mesh but before we do move
on to the ultimate torture test for this
case today's video sponsor s cd-keys
comm has a wicked deal on Windows 10
single end-user licenses this is the
legit stuff and it's going for 12
dollars a key if you use the coupon code
TYC
SK that's right just click the link in
the description below load the coupon
code up and then you've got yourself a
really cheap inexpensive legit Windows
10 user license besides also easy to
navigate and I've haven't had one single
problem since I've started using SCD
keys so what are you waiting for
links in the description below let's get
back to those tests
so we just finished overclocking the CPU
to five gigahertz on all those eight
cores and the graphics card as well the
RT X xx atti we managed to overclock
that on both the memory and the core
clocks and then we proceeded to load up
some battlefield 5 and the temperatures
were pretty impressive
the CPU was hovering around 70 degrees
while playing this the 9900 K of course
does get hot it doesn't matter if it's
in this case or if it's out on a test
bed and so it was good to see that this
case wasn't really introducing any
problems in terms of making things
hotter the graphics card itself on the
auto fan speeds went up to 80 degrees
which is still okay but on the r-tx 20
ATT is in general they do put out a lot
of heat so I decided to manually set the
fan speeds to 80% and the 9900 K and the
RCX 20 atti together is putting out
about 500 watts getting dumped into the
case so it does need good airflow
otherwise things are gonna heat up
really quickly so it was good to see
that those three fans on the region 360
at the front we're bringing in adequate
air flow and then the two fans at the
top as well as the one at the rear for
the exhaust were doing a good job of
keeping a tunnel of air flowing through
to make sure things did not overheat
some of the good news is I played some
multiplayer and this rig was
ridiculously smooth there was no hiccups
whatsoever whilst playing battlefield 5
I didn't think I noticed any stuttering
the whole time I was playing both
single-player and multiplayer both on 32
and 64 men servers however I did get
asked in the previous build to test out
World of Warcraft with the new DX 12
update so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna load that up and then compare it
directly against dx11 in a massive
battle which should give us some
differences if there are any to be had
so we're back now with some results for
you guys I decided to test the big
battle which has a lot of NPCs there's a
lot of stuff going on and on dx12 versus
dx11 the new update does indeed give
your cpu better frames per second
because the whole time in this game the
r-tx 20 atti at 1080p
maximum settings was really only going
around 50% so it had a lot more Headroom
which means we're now CPU bound
switching over to dx12 saw an increase
of nearly 22% extra frames so we went
from around 95 average over to big
benchmarks versus over a hundred and 15
on the DX 12 so if you're playing this
game and you've updated to the latest
update you'll definitely want to be
using DX 12 no matter what you do
because it's gonna be giving you
increased frame rates especially when it
comes to raids or big battles where
there's lots going on so now we're
closing out with this build it is one
expensive PC this whole building total
cost 37 hundred US dollars or if you're
in Australia 50-100 AUD now I recently
built an expensive AMD thread Ripper
build which is now my main rig for
editing videos but this rig behind me as
well is indeed another experiment
because I want to try out the more
expensive pcs that I've got here and
compare them to my 2013 Xeon for what I
do in my main workflow this one just
happens to be an incredible gaming PC
but of course it is very expensive I
think this one right here is one of the
most expensive pcs have built on the
channel to date but of course it is very
expensive in the price performance
really isn't there but I want to use
this as my main rig as well to see how
it compares to that 2013 Zeon because so
far the thread Ripper chip actually has
its advantages as well as its
disadvantages and so I'm going to be
using that for a good month and then
I'll be changing over to this using that
for a good month and then going back to
the Zeon and then making one big final
report for you guys
but in terms of price performance this
thing right here is certainly anything
but that but of course it does have some
of the best performance possible for a
single CPU and GPU solution but lastly
with the BitFenix and so mesh they've
done an excellent job of updating this
case making it very easy to build in
just like the Enzo before it except it's
got mesh at the front which allows for
now air flow to come through and cool
down more expensive parts like the RT X
2080 TI and also the eight core 9900 k
in the previous review I did I didn't
recommend it for higher-end builds I
thought it was good for people who
didn't want to overclock as I thought
the case itself actually looks really
good nothing looks tacky on it and the
mesh implementation on this case
actually looks really good so if you do
enjoy the aesthetics of this case
especially for its price and now you
want airflow and that's what the ENSO
mesh is going to deliver so I can
definitely recommend it for someone
looking for a solid case for sub $100
and they also want tempered glass I
would however recommend getting some
additional fans and also if your hopes
are mounting a top radiator
unfortunately that's not going to happen
on this case so that's probably the only
negative as opposed to that cable
management's really good and everything
is straightforward and easy to build in
any way guys hope you enjoyed today's
video if you did then be sure to hit
that like button and let us know in the
comments section below
what you think of this monster build and
also the N side mesh love reading your
thoughts and opinions as always and I
hope you have a happy new year also if
you're going to build something
expensive then you can save a little bit
of money on your Windows 10 key so don't
forget to check out today's video spawn
SCD case links in the description below
12 US dollars for a single end-user
license key and I'll catch you in I'll
protect video very soon peace out for
now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
