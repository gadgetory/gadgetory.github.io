hottest graphics cards out there at the
moment the RX 480 and the GTX 1060
though what your definition of hot maybe
may be different to mine welcome to tech
city this is brian coming to you guys
today with an overdue comparison of the
GTX 1060 versus the RX for 18 now
without wasting any more time let's get
on with those benchmarks
Oh
me
you
so coming out of those benchmarks we
could see that the GTX 1060 did score a
clear victory over the RX 480 though in
some of those titles like Deus Ex
mankind the RX 480 did score a victory
over the GTX 1060 also with that Vulcan
benchmarking doumitt was great to see
that the RX 480 was getting some pretty
decent gains when we switched over to
the API there was getting around about
fifteen percent and this was with my
benchmarks which were all apples to
apples in this video so what about the
actual cards themselves though yes I am
using the GTX 1060 Strix which I believe
does have a factory overclocked out of
the box though that being said I did do
both these cards to their max overclocks
and I did have that our X 480 cranked up
with the fan speeds so temperatures
wouldn't be an issue let's have a listen
so besides that horrid noise I only
managed to get an extra 70 megahertz out
of the RX 480 it was a pretty bad
overclocker and the GTX 1060 I had
around here too that thing was pretty
bad as well only scored an extra hundred
megahertz on the overclock there so both
these guards were pretty bad
overclockers and that showed in the
results now let's talk about the price
of these graphs cards both the 1060 and
the Irish for Eddie are coming in at
around over two hundred fifty dollars
now in my opinion this is a
disappointing price level I would like
to see both these cards hanging around
about two hundred dollars which is where
I think they belong I think after two
years after the gtx 970 was released at
three hundred and thirty dollars I think
we kind of deserve it as tech
enthusiasts to get these things under
two hundred dollars if possible or
around that level considering that some
of these cars are coming in around two
hundred eighty dollars even up to three
hundred dollars I don't think you're
getting much price performance there or
even better yet if you're into buying
used parts like I am you can go and pick
up a GTX 970 or an are 93 94 around
about 150 to 200 dollars the one thing I
will say about the GTX 1060 was when we
switched over to dx11 to Vulcan and also
dx12 we saw kind of reduced performance
there which was kind of an eye opener
since this grab Scott is meant to have
dx12 support and it is supposedly meant
to have asynchronous support now what it
boils down to with the GTX 1016 the rs4
it is that they're both good cards you
can't go wrong with either though I do
think they are a little bit overpriced
for what they are at the moment even
though I'm going to get that argument in
the comments like they're really good
value for money its better days money
than a GTX 970 it's been two years
brothers what are we waiting for is tech
enthusiasts we're just gonna keep
getting trickled out I don't know
but you guys let me know in the comment
section below what you think about both
these Graham shots and I'll get back to
you as soon as I can if you like this
video please hit that like button and
I'll catch you in the next tech video
very soon peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
