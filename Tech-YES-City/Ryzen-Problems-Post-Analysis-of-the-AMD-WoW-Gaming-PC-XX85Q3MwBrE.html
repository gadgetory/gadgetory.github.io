different we're gonna talk about some
problems that we had that we ran into
when making this triple surround setup
here as well as they're talking about
how to set up an Nvidia surround display
actually got quite a few comments on how
to do this and what I do recommend if
you're gonna use a single graphics card
like we did here I get one with three
DisplayPort outs and so the 1070 I from
Galax that we're using had just that now
the models we have have DisplayPort ins
and it's pretty important because
DisplayPort is just that interface
that's so straightforward to use I do
prefer it over the others as it I've
never had problems in the past using it
I couldn't imagine if you're using HDMI
or if you're using DVI especially you
might run into some different problems
especially if you're mixing a DVI HDMI
and in DisplayPort I don't know what
that would be like before that's worth
we use three display ports and we're
running it off a single graphics card
and you just go into the menu after
you've installed that it'll recognize
three monitors and then you can go into
the Nvidia control panel and it'll just
have the option there to enable surround
and then you do have to fiddle around a
little bit to get the monitors
configured so your mouse can then just
span over the whole three displays once
you've done that you're good to go but
besides that there was also some really
weird problems that we ran into with
this build and that was to do with the
motherboard and a weird thing that I've
never seen before
was we initially built the PC and I went
to press power like I was getting the
b-roll done and I went to get the power
button shot and it just wouldn't turn on
and at this stage I was just I was livid
because the memory was lighting up the
board looked like it was getting power
and so usually that means you might have
a dead motherboard on your hands and I
said to myself no way this can't be
possible because if it's a dead
motherboard
I gotta go then pull like literally
everything out of this build and then
replace the motherboard and so what I
ended up doing was starting to go
through the process of diagnosing
problems and this is where things got
even weirder because on Rison there is
like a little bit of
weird hack that if you've got the power
left on and you insert a CPU then it
will turn the computer on and so we
tried doing this and the power just sort
of drained out for a second and then
went back on and I was like at this
stage thinking yep I've definitely got a
dead multiple because we tried taking
the power switch out and sometimes the
power switch itself on a case it's very
rare I only usually have it happen on
cheaper cases the power button can be
faulty and it doesn't turn on in that
case you can change it to the reset pon
or you can use what I use and that's a
little gold finger and use that to short
out the power pin and try and boot it
that way so we tried that first didn't
work then we tried inserting the CPU
that didn't work and then I just said to
myself okay I'm gonna try change the
memory and so change the memory around
and miraculously it worked and I'm
sitting there scratching my head like
woah okay I've never had a board not
boot and then you change the memory over
and a boots like this I mean I have had
it happen before it just doesn't boot
but this is very weird anyway so we
ended up changing the memory back to the
Vengeance Pro and then it booted up fine
so I was just left scratching my head
but after that everything was then
smooth and a good to go but one other
thing I'll talk about with Rison is
there is a problem that's been prevalent
in practically every motherboard
manufacturer across both the 300 series
and the 400 series motherboards and that
is when you've got an SSD installed and
a hard drive install at the same time
and then you try to install Windows on
your computer if you install it on the
SSD which is where you'd want to install
Windows because it'll be faster snappy
or etc it'll actually install the system
reserve files on the hard drive and this
happens so much unlike scratching my
head again on why this is happening but
if you do have this problem come up what
you can do about it is identify it
straight away by going into former hard
drives and just seeing if C Drive has
your system reserves if it doesn't you
may wish to reformat your whole computer
because the only way you're really
getting head
this is by reformatting new computer
unfortunately I've tried doing a lot of
different solutions didn't work now
another problem that can come from that
is also the hard drive if it's over 2
terabytes and it's got system reserve
files on it then you won't be getting
any more than 2 terabytes of storage out
of that drive so there's another reason
why you might want to reformat so when
it comes to reforming the machine if you
do have this problem on Rison what you
can do about it is then just disconnect
your hard drive when you're installing
Windows install on the SSD once you're
in Windows everything's fine
turn it off connect the second hard
drive up and then boot back into Windows
format it and you should be all good to
go
so now we've got some questions about
this build in particular on the video
and there were some really good
questions the first being why will we
use a rise in CPU on World of Warcraft
especially since it likes that single
core higher core clock IPC and so you've
got like a few people recommending the
83 50k which is absolutely fine but I
found with this I wanted to try rising 5
on world Warcraft and not only that of
course we've got the options there to
overclock on a budget and I wanted to
see what kind of price performance we
could get rise and ran really well for
what a Warcraft wants you overclocked it
and more particularly 'king at that
vengeance pro memory you have to get
good ddr4 memory that goes to around
3200 megahertz at least with an XMPP
profile you've got that your memories
going to run really well
Rison is going to be getting more
performance and then we've got the CPU
clocked at 4.1 gigahertz now taking it
above that on a be 350 motherboard like
the pro 4 it's a budget choice so I
wouldn't expect it to go to 4.2 even
though it probably could I wouldn't run
it every day at those settings just
because the motherboard itself isn't
exactly the best but also another good
question that came out of that video was
what's the difference between the stock
rising cooler and also the h-60 and on
this particular build since this is six
core 12 threaded Rison 12 nanometer cpu
so i'm gonna be pushing out actually
that much heat but when it does push out
the heat when you overclock it it does
need something better than the stock
cooler to keep it under wraps and so the
h-60 is gonna make a big difference over
the stock cooler especially once you
start going past
gigahertz for example so in this case
we're able to get that extra performance
and use this cooler and the great thing
is when you get a cooler like this you
can port it from build to build or if
you want to upgrade to an eight core 16
threaded Rison then you've got the
option to keep that under wraps as well
if you overclock it so I can't recommend
coolers like that I'm also not just in
the sense that you're going to get
overclocked out of it right now but you
can also keep using it as the future go
forward
and that about wraps up today's video if
you guys enjoyed this one that be sure
to hit that like button also we actually
do get one more question about this case
in particular the specular 5 and the
airflow on the build and so if you are
getting this case and you are putting
higher-end components than what we did
today then I would recommend maybe
getting a couple of more fans at the
front even possibly some fans at the top
here and blowing air out of the case
because it will get hot with the
graphics card inside especially since
it's not a reference blower model that's
sucking air and blowing it out of the
case but we did have the h-60 as we saw
in the temperature test and that's
actually pushing hot air out of the case
as well so it's not only keeping the CPU
cool but it's also working to help keep
the case airflow better than it
otherwise would be so we really didn't
see the need in this case to put any
extra fans in and when wargaming we
didn't have any problems whatsoever -
even when we overclocked the graphics
card hopefully you guys gained some
insight on NVIDIA surround and also some
of the problems that go on here behind
the scenes it's not always smooth
sailing when it comes to doing these
builds I got really frustrated setting
this thing up initially and it was just
a problem that as I said before that
I've never seen before but also we did
have problems trying to get world of
warcraft installed where we copied it
from the NASS and it wasn't being
recognized and so I just bit the ball
I'm like yep just read downloading it
again and then we got it working after a
few hours so usually it seems like
Murphy's Law does hit me pretty hard
when something can go wrong it usually
does without a side I'll catch you guys
in the next Tech video very soon peace
out for now wait
also the last thing I'm getting asked
about after I did the set up video for
some reason is this desk right here and
I picked this up when I was building the
studio a while back and we actually
hustled this table so you like
everything in the studio is pretty much
been like a deal we got this for $150
for the whole desk itself and that was
um essentially like when I went to the
stores they were looking for at least
half a grand for something that's like
this thick and also of this quality so
when I saw this I just had to pretty
much put my hand on it give it a nice
caressing and I realized it was really
good desk and so of course it was really
heavy but then we made a custom stand
for it because the guy was only selling
just the actual top itself so the stands
were like 20 bucks and then I've never
looked back since then so literally got
an amazing desk for 1/3 at least a third
of the price that you would get it for
at the stores I don't know what make and
model that is specifically I just saw it
and I was like yep like this one and I'm
getting it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
