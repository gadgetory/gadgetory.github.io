where I give you guys a little bit of a
look behind the scenes talk about
upcoming builds and also today we're
talking about the 12 core Haswell that I
have here where people have requested
that I try and get the all the core
ratios on the max turbo multiplier so
that should be pretty interesting I'll
have a look at that for you guys and if
it works out then I'll do a full
tutorial as well and of course we'll
also do some use parts hunting so let's
get on with it
welcome back to tech city and here is
this month's build for March I was
searching for a graphics card last month
and I couldn't get any good deals so I
decided just to rage quit looking for
deals last month and we ended up with an
RX 470 which we picked up off Amazon for
a pretty good price and then moving on
here we've got that motherboard that I
picked up brand-new though the CPU is
the four core that is that engineering
sample from Aliexpress it's essentially
like the i7 6700 K except you're paying
like $100 for it it only goes up to
around 3.8 gigahertz but still not too
worried at those speeds it can still
play games really well then we got a new
hard drive here and of course this is a
cooler from a Zalman I think it was I
picked this one up in Japan for pretty
cheap I think I was like 20 bucks maybe
and also we have here a case from
Thermaltake they sent this over this is
the Versa H 25 real budget in case I
wanted to give it a look and try it out
and see if it's any good so then we've
got some memory there as well ddr4
memory from Kingston and that's pretty
much the build wrapped up I've also got
a ten dollar power supply which is a
delta that I brought over from Japan I
actually brought over like eight of
these power supplies back when I left
Japan and a lot of people like oh man
it's a ten dollar power supply it has to
be bad but that's not the truth those
power supplies I picked up they came out
of servers and they're really good
brands they're like Delta f SP when they
made their good power supplies I mean
their quality stuff guys and the reason
that it's ten dollars is just supply and
demand no one really is in demand
because they don't really know how good
those power supplies were and the
sellers just had to offload them so I
picked up a heap of them shipped him
back on the boat and been using him in
builds ever
since so there's the build PC of the
month it's coming to you guys but with
that said let's go hunt for some parts
on gumtree and see what deals we can get
so pulled up the deals here and there's
three or four deals that look really
good I mean the first one here this is
just too far away but damn and that
price is like a hundred and fifty
dollars for an a 90 to 90 with the
waterblock on it too I mean if if the
drive wasn't so big I'd probably picked
that up but the next year we got up here
is the gtx 770 he's asking $100 and
that's for the full gigabyte edition so
I think we'll drop in a $90 offer there
and we'll see how that goes and then the
next two people here is someone selling
a heap of different products and they've
sold out on a lot of the stuff there but
that's a really good deal there it's the
corset 1200 watt power supply gold rated
power supply for a hundred bucks so
we're gonna give them a call and see if
we can take see if he takes $80 for that
this is a strand dolls too by the way
not American so it'd be like 60 USD for
a third 1200 I passed by that be really
good and then last up here we've got two
gtx 970 s4 2 for 400 for the bows or
2/10 each so I'm gonna give them a call
and see if he'll take 170 or something
similar for one of these cards and
that'd be really good for a build for
next month
hi Maya a gallon yeah Brian made I saw
your ad on gumtree yeah do you still
have the Corsair power supply mate Oh
mate thanks a lot bye so you already
sold the Corsair power supply so we're
out of like this let's try the next deal
ma so we called a few people and there's
no luck on the power supply that was
sold and the graphics card is the guy
didn't answer so we've put in an offer
for the GTX 770 so hopefully get word
back on that and yeah it's been a real
boss lately like I haven't been getting
really good deals but keep in mind I
haven't been searching that much as well
I've only been doing this once a month
like what you guys are seeing on
camera is like literally all I'm doing
in terms of deal deals hunting so anyway
guys let's get on to something different
this 12-core has well try and get that
on the max turbo boost multiplier so
I've been added for hours and hours now
trying to get this has well easy on to
work and these are the 0 and 12 cores
and 14 cores and whatnot that you can
get off eBay and essentially just won't
work I've tried everything and now
basically there's two different CPU ID
models here there's the zero six f1 and
the zero 6 f2 now if you have the zero 6
f2 this hack can work where you can get
the maximum turbo multiplier to go
across all cores and you can essentially
get really damn good value for money
although if you have the 0 6 f1 which is
unfortunately is what I've got at the
moment it won't work like you'll remove
all the microcode make your custom bios
and then you try to install it and it
just won't boot at all you'll get it'll
spit out like a 79 code keep in mind
though it could be this motherboard but
this is the only x99 motherboards that I
have on hand are the newer ones I don't
have any of the gen ones like the
extreme 4 and stuff so it could work on
those earlier motherboards but on the
later motherboards I don't think it
works with the 0 6 f10 6 f2 is the one
you want to get any guys I'll try and do
a little bit more research but I've just
had enough headaches with this I've
literally like reflash the boss about 20
times now trying to get this thing to
work so if you do want to attempt this
make sure you've got a dual BIOS and you
can flash it when you when things don't
go right so anyway that was an
interesting experience I'm gonna get
some sleep and then I'll try and finish
this vlog off
so without a good time to think about
this project here and really it's just
one of those things where you just get
rekt I think like I noticed in cpuid
there was the multiplier they're reading
out 25 and it wasn't any 12 in there so
maybe that's got to do with it
since it will usually read out the max
multiplier and cpuid regardless so kind
of a little bit doubt about that I mean
we didn't get it to work but if anyone
has got this the f one's working that's
the early engineering samples anyone has
got them on higher multipliers I'd love
to hear your methodology but other than
that guys let's take a look at the
workstation rig a little sneak preview
of that so here these guys here's what's
going to be the workstation rate I'm
using the X 370 Taichi I'm gonna be
doing a review on that and then also an
overclocking tutorial for you guys too
and we've got here the 1800 X so I got
sent that in from the lovely people over
at AMD and now moving on to this case
here this is the air 740 probably my
favorite case at the moment from Corsair
I mean look at this this is really damn
cool you've got like a door there and
we'll just take that off and also
another thing about Corsair as their
help sponsoring the channel now so
that's really awesome thank you guys
that course s so much they've been
helping out with things like my
benchmark rig and now they're gonna be
helping out with a workstation rig so
it's really going a long way thank you
guys so much over of course there and
yeah I can't wait to bring you guys the
build I'm just waiting for a few more
parts to rock up but it's going to be an
epic AMD risin rig and there's my hot
wife on there there's the update on it
it's still in pieces I'm still waiting
for that digitizer to come through so
hopefully I get that in and we can do
that next month fix that thing up and
see if the $30 replacement screen
actually
anyway that's it for marches behind the
scenes tag vlog and if there's anything
