mechanical keyboard from a company
called the MDS it's actually been a
while since I've had a mechanical
keyboard come through here however when
Gambia asked me if I wanted to take a
look at their home as light mechanical
keyboard I thought sure why not
and today I'm gonna be telling you guys
what you get in the box with this I mean
you're talking about the features of
this keyboard none of you were giving
you my subjective opinion on this
keyboard as well as a noise test now
straight onto the keyboard itself the
main thing as soon as you pick up this
keyboard you'll notice that the build
quality is very good everything on this
keyboard felt solid and rigid which was
really surprising coming from a company
that I've never heard from before
furthermore upon pulling off the key
switches themselves you'll notice under
there they've got red mechanical
switches and they're by a company called
TTC so that's right they're not Cherry
MX
mechanical switches however don't let
that fool you and practice these things
work exactly like a Cherry MX which and
I've actually got a cherry MX red
keyboard here and I could not tell the
difference one bit that being said just
above those switches you've got red LED
backlighting which is individually
backlit for every key on this keyboard
however one thing to note is that you do
not have control over every individual
key backlighting they're a little bit of
a bummer there however the key caps
themselves feel very well constructed
the texture is also like a semi-gloss
smooth finish your fingers will grip
them and they will feel smooth kudos to
Gambia's for making such a good key cap
now the actual font on there as well in
my opinion looks very nice it's like a
solid font that's sort of like a mix
between normal and razor and I think
it's a perfect blend on a keyboard now
on to the main construction of the
keyboard itself it's an all plastic
design and the back plating is plastic
too however as I said before very solid
build quality the key caps as well in
practice did not wiggle at all you also
have a wrist rest on the front of the
keyboard and over a hundred keys to
utilize on this keyboard itself now an
intuitive thing and one thing
I do like about this keyboard is the
individual backlighting for the caps
lock num lock and scroll lock keys if
they're on then the lights will come on
if they're off the lights will go off as
well you've also got two macro keys
there the spacebar and the B key is
labeled by G 1 and G 2 and you've also
got the function key to enable them in
the software and the software is very
lightweight and easy to use but we'll
talk a little bit about that later as
well
back onto the rear of the keyboard
itself you've got 6 grips there to grip
the table and again this keyboard it
doesn't move once you place it on the
table it's got one level of adjustment
there which will allow you to get your
height up on your keyboard if you wish
to use it like that you've also got
three angles and pivots there to cable
manage the braided cable which also has
a gold tip plating the cable itself
comes in at 1.8 meters long so ample
long enough though if you do need a
longer length you may wish to get a USB
extension cable also one thing to point
out is the 5 volt 250 milli amp
requirement so if you're using this with
a very cheap laptop just keep in mind
that it isn't the 100 milliamps standard
now back onto the front of the keyboard
where all the magic happens you have 4
different levels of brightness there
you've got off 33% 66% and 100% you've
also got the option for breathing with 4
to 6 to 8 second intervals there and
lastly you have the responsive effect
where you can turn the lighting off but
when you press a key the whole keyboard
lights up one thing to keep in mind is
that the Print Screen button for some
reason will always stay lit up now
taking a look at the software itself you
have 6 different profiles there to
choose from and you can save them rename
them you can also attach them to the
launch with different games and you can
even assign different hotkeys when you
want to launch those profiles very
intuitive design with the software it's
also lightweight and it can be saved
with the onboard memory of the keyboard
so you don't have to actually use this
program once you've saved your different
settings also you've got the option
there to create different macros for
instance I created a macro to open up
Wolfenstein and it worked flawlessly not
to mention you can change the different
speeds of the timings in between very
good macro function with this keyboard
you can also give those macros to your
friends or
can copy macros from other people also
looking at the software you've got the
option there to switch your function key
and windows key around and now
interesting or oddly enough with this
keyboard is you have the windows key
located on the right side of the
keyboard by default but again this
software alleviates that problem at
least for me very quickly without any
problems at all looking below that
you've got the 6 + 21 + key rollover
effect there the one thing I will point
out is when I tried the 21 + key
rollover effect it didn't work properly
when I for instance hit 10 keys at the
same time I could my keyboard bugged out
so I just leave it on 6 + key rollover
and in practice I think it's more of a
marketing effect than anything
also this software allows you to add
individual recordings to macros and/or
individual key presses lastly on the
note of software they allow you to
update the software at any time which
means that they can add in more
functions in the future which is a great
thing with this keyboard and with that
being said we'll quickly move on now to
a noise test and then I'll go on to my
subjective opinion and conclusion so now
I'll talk about my experience with this
keyboard and what I like and don't like
about it however ever since I've pulled
this keyboard out of the box I've been
nothing but impressed with it the build
quality is amazing nothing rattles
nothing feels loose and even though it's
made of all plastic
it just feels solid and rigid and this
is great coming from a company that I've
never heard of before not to mention
that the key caps are some of the best
I've ever had
best I've ever typed on it's got a
slight curvature there the font looks
gorgeous and the texture is amazing to
type on and then that red LED
backlighting comes through at night and
it matches my red and black themed
gaming PC build downstairs perfectly
it's as if they knew I needed this
keyboard so kudos the Gambia's for
getting this right however on that note
we will talk about the red switches so
this keyboard uses TTC red switches and
now they differ from blue and brown
switches and if you guys want to know
the differences between those switches
I'll put a video up here that you can
check out where I explain all the
differences between them and who and
what switch is best for who however the
red switch that they use today is really
good for gaming as it's really
responsive and you'll absolutely love it
when you're coming to competitive games
and you need the fastest keypresses
so let's talk about the red LED
backlighting now every key is
individually backlit however one thing I
would have liked to have seen is
individual backlighting control
especially since the software allows for
this to happen and if you could utilize
this it would have made the keyboard
perfect I mean I could have had a
profile for dota 2 with the individual
hotkeys backlit up and then change to
Starcraft to have the hotkeys I use in
that game backlit up and then go to Cod
same thing however I'd imagine they will
implement this in a future update or
hopefully they will and this keyboard
would be perfect though lastly you're
wondering about the TTC switches and the
fact that they don't use cherry and for
me that is not a problem at all I
actually have another keyboard here a
Leopold which is going to sit on the
bench now this uses Cherry MX switches
except the problem with this keyboard is
these three keys are busted and I
actually need my print screen key so I
had to reprogram my key through some
dodgy program to make my print screen
down here so I mean the fact is with the
switches themselves they will last a
long time it's the implementation of
those switches which is what matters
ie the workmanship on the keyboard how
good was the soul during etc etc and
honestly the workmanship on the Gambia's
keyboard is really good and as I said
before this léopold keyboard here is
gonna be getting bench lined so we
conclusion I'm going to be giving this
keyboard four and a half stars out of
five I was impressed with the build
quality absolutely impressed with it not
only that the keycaps themselves very
easy to type on feel great and then
you've got that amazing looking font as
well that's red LED backlit and all that
if you go to their website you can get
it for 60 US dollars shipped to your
door
that is why
thing that you should get on honestly if
you're looking for a keyboard and you're
a gamer and you don't have a mechanical
keyboard already I would jump on this
now keep in mind though that it is only
red LED backlit so you if you're teaming
it up with the black and blue theme for
example you might want to look at a
different option however you can turn
the backlighting off and even it then at
60 USD it's a great Buy also one thing I
would like to see with this keyboard
would be the individual backlight and
control and I hope they implement that
in a future update of their software
I think this would this is the reason
why I'm not giving it five stars is that
it just doesn't have that individual
backlighting control there as well as
the fact as the N key rollover isn't
really 21 n key rollover as well in
incense I guess it might be eight and
key rollover tricky rollover however
that being said the Gambia's keyboard
here today is absolutely amazing and
they've done a really good job on
getting this keyboard in at a great
price so that's about it for today guys
if you like this video then you not to
do get on that like button good good
give it a bit of a hit there and if you
haven't already subscribe to tech yes
City for more tech news reviews and
whatnot and if you have any questions
about the Gambia's cable then don't
forget to drop a comment in the comment
section below and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can
