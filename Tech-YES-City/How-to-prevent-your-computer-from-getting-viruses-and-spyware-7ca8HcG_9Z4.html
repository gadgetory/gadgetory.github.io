i'm just coming back today with a quick
sort of people have asked me you know
how do you keep your computer clean and
do i need to reinstall my computer I'm
just here to give you guys a quick sort
of information quick bit of information
about how you can prevent yourself
welcome you know prevent your computer
from getting bloated up so mainly what
you want to do with your computer is you
want to change some settings in internet
explorer and but firstly you know a lot
of people have anti viruses and see I
don't have an antivirus and i don't
think i will use one in the future
because they they themselves make your
computer slower so I used to I used to
use an antivirus program but then i
uninstall it and i notice my games were
running a lot faster so if you guys want
to use an online virus scanner i
recommend you go to sim and tech and you
check out their website so sim and tech
has an online scan and you can go check
that out so that if you guys got you
know if you don't need to have a virus
scanner you can just continue to
semantic security check online and it
works really well does a good job and
this is another thing I wanted to so I'm
using internet explorer 9 if you guys
using in the next four and nine as well
I've got a quick hint for you so
basically sites like this like SEMATECH
will download and install activex
controls on your computer so you want to
go to options here and you want to go to
internet options and then when you get
on this screen here you want to go to
delete browsing history on exit you want
to click that check that and make sure
it's checked and then another thing you
want to do is you want to go to settings
and every time i start internet explorer
you want to make sure that is checked so
sometimes it'll be on never and that's a
bad things it's going to store all these
activex controls all this blood stuff
that you downloaded so you want to
change that to every time i start
internet explorer and i set my temporary
usage to 250 megabytes so that's what i
do guys and my computer I never get I
never noticed it getting slower and
slower it doesn't slow down I basically
never get bloatware
any time I ever get a virus is if my
brother is using my computer and you
know I don't know what the hell he does
so you know have had virus in the past
but I've never myself got a virus on my
computer for like probably like ten
years and so yeah you know I take these
precautions and you know watch what you
download so you know there's the
semantics online virus skin it works
really well you guys so you don't really
need a virus scanner on your computer
it'll slow down your computer and this
is just a quick thing quick thing you
can do to make sure your computer's safe
and not downloading a lot of bloatware
if you're worried about you just visited
a bad website you can click on that
delete button and click delete and it
will delete everything so if you're
worried about that you can do that and
yeah that's about it guys so another
thing into if you've got bad software
you I mean if you've got a lot of
bloatware and computing go to programs
and features and uninstall that bad
software as well but we can do that
another time so yeah guys this is just
quick video today to let you know how to
prevent your computer from getting
bloatware and stuff so if you've got any
questions guys leave them in the comment
section below and i'll reply as soon as
I can and of course subscribe to get
Brian easygoing as it really helps so
