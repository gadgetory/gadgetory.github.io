play a bit of dota2 got a fresh haircut
and then I jump onto my latest video and
I check through the comments section and
people basically saying the yes-man B
the BS men and I got a little bit
offended I was thinking damn all this
hustle it's all real all those phone
calls they're all real so instead of
talking the talk here today we're just
gonna jump in the yes 'mobile and go for
a bit of a mid-month hustle and see what
deals we can quickly come up with on the
spot now keep in mind this won't be the
used PC part Sun of the month that'll be
coming on later on in the month when I
go overseas so stay tuned for that one
but today we're gonna see what we can
snap up in terms of deals but also if we
fail on some of the deals we're gonna go
through my thought process as well in
relation to that now in the previous
video the prices that I said I would pay
is based on where I live which is on the
Gold Coast Australia now where I live
the use PC parts market is pretty
healthy regardless of the prices of new
graphics cards which they are a bit more
expensive here especially tempered DT is
from retails for example have gone up 10
60 s as well that really hasn't flowed
on a whole lot to the used PC part
market you've just got a lot more guys
now wanting to buy used grams cards so
that's making the demand for use grabs
cards ever so more than it previously
was you still go guys however out there
who want to go buy a new graphics card
and they'll pay the extra money for it
they want a 1060 day instead of paying
300 bucks they'll go pay 400 bucks
because they want a new graphics card
and what they'll do is they'll say well
I paid $400 for my previous graphics
card and I'll go sell that for 150 bucks
and they don't really care about there's
this whole tech YouTube community going
on there's this whole cryptocurrency
mining thing going on they're not even
part of that they don't even know about
it
so generally they're the kind of guys
and there's a lot of them you're gonna
get good deals off if that makes any
sense but anyway there's a lot more to
deal hunting than just the price so as I
said before today we'll go into some of
the fails but also some of the other
deals out there we've got an R 7 360
lined up for 40 Australian dollars got a
whole PC that looks almost brand new for
600 or strained
now one Australian dollar is a lot
weaker than a US dollar and i will be
talking today's video in Australian
dollars and this PC basically has an ex
79 Mini ITX motherboard 500 bytes
Samsung Evo SSD so you're thinking about
- Ram motherboard case power supply GTX
780 for the win Edition so this thing I
got some plans for it and we also as
well managed to pick up and this is
another thing about being quick go to
GTX 1060 off eBay with a sale for $285
astraying
so this is all recent anyway when a lot
of people call me out in the comment
section instead of talking the talk I'm
gonna go walk the walk so let's do it
so we just got back from the post office
had to pick up a heap of different boxes
as well and we've got the deals too so
went for a drive got these two deals
here this is an r7 360 got that 440
ozzie so we'll put that on the testbed a
bit later but this is the main prize
here from shuttle never heard of this
before
shuttle X PC I have heard of X PC they
do do water cooling but I never knew
they made their own motherboard which is
really weird I don't know if that's an
OEM license from a company like ours
rock or MSI but we'll check a bit later
too but this is a cool thing here look
at this cooler I believe it's an air
cooler but it looks like a water cooler
and that's coming off the CPU in the
middle there so X 79 Mini ITX with the
GTX 780 EVGA for the win now my plans
honestly my plans with this is to take
the 780 out and that GTX 1060 that we
just bought for 280 bucks we chucked
that in and we got this for 600
Australian dollars - so we chuck in the
ten sixty that we cost us two hundred
eighty bucks
and we put this up for eleven hundred
bucks so we try and pull some profit off
that and we get a free GTX 780 that's
what I was planning to do with this
thing and of course there's like
literally no cleaning that needs to be
done besides a bit of wd-40 on this
thing so the previous owner Tim who I
met he was really nice he obviously took
really good care of this thing so let's
boot it up and see what it's all about
and everything's booting up it's
absolutely fine one thing I noticed is
the fan is PWM controlled and it's a
little bit of that inferior technology
from back in the day where it's
literally like PWM controlled to the
degree so you can probably just hear it
I mean I can hear it here it's just up
and down constantly in these little
micro increments and it's actually
pretty annoying and I'm not even OCD
also another thing too is this windows
it's unoptimized its filthy so let's
quickly optimize this
so we tried overclocking this PC and as
I'm overclocking it I noticed the name
of the PC it keeps greeting me with kirt
so I guess it's telling me something
maybe I got to change my name to Kurt so
let's reroll that intro welcome back to
tokyo city this is kurt coming to you
guys today with a new video but when we
got down to it with this shuttle PC it
has a shuttle BIOS in it's an OEM
proprietary thing and it does have the
option to overclock the CPU but it's not
locking in those over clocks no matter
what I do they're just shaky I'll get
performance it's even less than the
stock clocks I did manage however to get
the X and P profiles in so that's a
decent thing but for what it's worth
this bias is useless and trying to flash
another boss on is just a nightmare with
this thing as well and I have been down
this route before and it generally
doesn't work out for me so instead of
wasting a day with this thing I'm just
gonna leave it as it is and actually
change the fans to mid mode so they
actually sound okay they're not
fluctuating and the temperatures are
pretty good so pretty happy with that
but let's check out that r7 360
so the r7 360 is working absolutely fine
but you may notice it's a little bit
dirty so what we're gonna do is I'm
gonna get out of the data vac and now
last time people were complaining that I
cleaned my computer parts on the carpets
so this time around what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna put it back down on the carpet
and clean it again
so this is the first time I've seen the
data vac not give me a satisfactory
clean look at that I could probably
clean that off with my finger better
have no fear however when we do a build
we shall hose it down in brake cleaner
so now here's the DMS of two deals I've
pulled up here I pulled up the r9 290
that was up for sale for 240 originally
so I offered 190 Australian dollars
which again with my recent video I did
falls right in line with the prices I'm
prepared to pay and he said sorry mate
looking for a higher price I just said
well how about 200
and he said 220 it's all yours and now
220 is going too high so I just said no
I can only do 200 so he said he'll get
back to me and then he said he wanted to
twenty and then I said pretty much no
way
so basically going back to now the gtx
1060 i picked that up at 285 shipped to
my door so why would you pay 224 nine
290 that's old it uses up a lot more
power and gets less performance under
ten sixty and so not only that it's the
gigabyte model back in the r9 290 days
so it wasn't that good to begin with i
believe it couldn't really keep that
thing under wraps so here's the next
deal we got up here is the gtx 780 Ti
going through the DMS I just say 161
that's all I'm prepared to pay there's
actually been a lot of offers already he
said he's not negotiable
and so at $200 he can keep his 780ti so
that's just how it is with those deals
now some other deals I pulled up here
I've got this one here I'm gonna pick
that up later in the week GTX 580 $50
Australian so that's a pretty good price
I've put an offer a down on this one
it's got a broken fan 70 Australian
dollars so I put in an offer of $60
hopefully they get back to me don't
think they've logged into Gumtree for a
few days so anyway but there it is guys
I'm just like I said I draw a line
that's what I'm prepared to pay if it
goes over that I ain't buying it it's
just a discipline thing if you pay too
much for it then you're going to end up
losing money especially if you want to
turn around and flip these pcs or test
them out or you're making them from a
friend then you're only losing money
right 20 bucks in my pocket is better
than 20 dollars in some guy I've never
met before is pocket so that's just how
it goes also I've been getting messaged
from some people who are listing on
gumtree
and after I do the use parts hunt they
they get a lot of lowball offers after I
do that used monthly parts on now I
don't know what to say
I just I love you guys a lot this is
funny
anyway you just got to keep home with
those prices
remember only pay what you're prepared
to pay you're prepared to get ripped off
for a gravis card then go get ripped off
those prices I put in that guide is what
I'm prepared to pay and I'm sticking to
those prices even if the cryptocurrency
mining boom continues which I'll tell
you something back from 2008 something
that I don't forget when ez free money
is flowing around it doesn't flow around
for that long so this cryptocurrency
mining thing it might last another six
months but again in the grand scheme of
things it's only another six months
after that six months you could see a
massive crash you could see ten sixties
going for really cheap so ten seventies
as well so anyway back to the video all
right so we've got some other things on
the table here this is Z 370 from Oris
they sent it in they said it's got
double the phases of the original one
they said people were complaining about
the original Z 370 being a little bit
weak what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try
blow this thing up for you guys see how
much it can handle we'll put it to the
test also this right here is a special
gift from deep cool and man I got it
right look at that tech you're City swag
on those fans I think we just quickly
boot these up and see that logo light up
so the three fans are booted up and they
look so good so big thanks the deep cool
for sending these out I'm definitely
gonna be using these in some kind of
custom build or they just gonna they're
gonna play a role on the channel because
that's just wicked I love that so now
next up here we've got a test bed well
I do not sure if this is actually a
testbed but I guess you could make it a
testbed if you just leave the front
panel off so total wind up on Twitter he
saw that I was in desperate need of a
testbed and he sent one over so thank
you so much for that I'll put it to good
use but one thing I will quickly explain
to you guys with this whole setup over
here I'm actually waiting for the second
32 inch monitor to rock up and then I
was gonna warm out to 32 inch monitors
for my main setup so that was actually a
funny story because it all ties in with
this here I've actually been waiting for
a monitor from aoc ages ago they had a
32 inch monitor and I thought oh well
that was gonna go perfect but they never
sent it I don't know and also on that
note they still have to send one of the
giveaway winners from a giveaway we did
a while back they still have to send a
monitor out to one of the subscribers in
lift-away near as well so I don't know
what's going on with AOC but it's a
little bit weird anyway the sonic saw
the review I did on their 4k monitor and
they noticed that I tested the input lag
and they loved that they were like look
like that's what we're about low input
lag really low input lag they sort of
want to make a name for themselves with
having really good gaming monitors so
they said how about you take a look at a
gaming monitor and I was like wow this
is perfect so this monitor here I'm
gonna review this see how good the input
lag is see how good it is for a VA panel
because I have heard that VA panels do
have quite bad response times and I have
heard that there is the Samsung version
of this as well so we're gonna see how
this stacks up for gaming I'll take a
look at that for you guys and also once
that's finished then I'll be completing
this section here or this section here
is what was over there as well the
monitor arm finally rocked up as well
for the streaming desk so get ready
because there's gonna be a lot of cool
content coming even though you guys
already know that the contents been
coming I mean look at this I've been
doing way too much wheeling at the
moment and not enough dealing to the
stage where this place is just getting
stacked
with stuff so when it comes down to it
deal hunting at least for me is a hobby
I love doing it now some of the times
you will get people who are aggressive
and they do basically tell you to f off
when you throw in an offer that's gonna
happen anything you do in life you're
gonna get people who will be angry if
something you just go to ignore that and
keep hustling because there are so many
people that I've got deals off who have
been wonderful people they've been
awesome and it makes me want to keep
going just like you guys the audience
most of you guys are really awesome and
you support the channel makes me want to
keep making content same is with deal
hunting don't be afraid to drop in and
offer even call someone up throw in an
offer and suss out a deal another thing
to with use PC parts hunting you've got
to be quick a lot of the times
especially if that deal is really good
don't be afraid to throw in near the
asking price I've seen some people throw
up graphics cards that are really good
prices they just don't really know what
it's worth but then people try and
lowball them on that already low offer
you generally won't see me doing that
because I know what things are worth I
will put in just a little snipe but I
won't go the full monty where he would
go on like $150 gtx 1060 and someone's
thrown an offer of $75 I doubt the guy's
gonna be selling his 10 64 75 bucks for
example but it was me I'd be dropping in
maybe 135 you know just doing a little
snake trying to get that deal anyway
guys hope you enjoyed today's video if
you did the me sure to hit that like
button and I'll catch you in another
tech video very soon peace out for now
bye
another thing too guys if you're selling
pcs make sure you log out of your
accounts the person who sold me this PC
is still logged into their email because
I went to download Google Chrome and
there's a lot of NDA stuff in the titles
man I'm know you're gonna read this
stuff I'm gonna log straight out but if
this wound up in the wrong hands man
damn so guys if you sell on pcs make
sure you mind yeah you don't have any
sensitive information up in your
computers holy damn there you go I'd
expect there I'd expect people to do the
same for me but not everyone would
unfortunately and also on that pretty
but today we're gonna look through some
of the deals so you can convert it on
Google see what I prep pay where you
guys play also before I get on with this
video I will say the place the beautiful
Gold Coast that I live in is blessed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
