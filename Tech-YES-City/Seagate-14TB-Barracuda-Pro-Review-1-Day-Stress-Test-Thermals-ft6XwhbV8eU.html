that's a 5 that's a 5 but we'll do
another one there you go
here on the table we've got CJ's latest
addition to their lineup of hard drive
this is the Barracuda Pro and this is a
helium based Drive and it's quite
fascinating because they're able to fit
such large amounts of storage in 3.5
inch form factor by now using a lighter
weight element and this enables them to
do a few things first of all since
they're using helium the drive will be
lighter compared to a same storage
equivalent Drive that uses co2 but it
also enables them now to use thinner
platters and in turn they can use more
platters in a hard drive
hence the 14 terabytes this also now
enables hard drive companies to utilize
lengthier warranty periods since there's
actually less friction going on inside
the drive itself which means less wear
and tear which means the longer life
which is not just beneficial for the
company themselves but also beneficial
for the end users where they don't have
to replace their drives as often with
the pricing in the u.s. coming in for
this particular model for 568 US dollars
at the moment and in Australia 799 AUD
but with that said let's get on with
some tests now put this thing under a
one-day stress test check the
temperatures out and also check out if
there was any hiccups and then we'll
report back to you guys
so finished up testing on this Drive and
these speeds are very consistent on the
read and writes we've done multiple 10
terabyte transfers here so that's a lot
of data that has been going through this
Seagate Drive maximum temperatures
reached 41 degrees Celsius this is in a
22 degree environment so this is really
good so far the maximum limit for the
temperatures is 60 degrees as reported
in this software here and when we place
the thermal imaging camera on the drive
itself with no air flow on it show that
things were pretty good so Seagate
definitely know what they're doing when
it comes to these helium based hard
drives
they are running very nicely and the
noise itself I'll let you guys take a
quick listen because in normal operation
it's very quiet but it does especially
nice reading and writing a lot does make
these little like sounds
so we just finished up testing the 14
terabyte drive and really there's
nothing more to it than to say that's
really solid it's getting over 250
megabytes both on the read and writes as
we looked at before and a Seagate
include a five-year warranty on the
Barracuda pros which is the same I
believe is the iron wolf pros
I believe the I'm with pro however does
have a slightly higher mean time before
failure of 1.2 million hours versus 1
million and also the aim of pro has six
hundred thousand cycles versus three
hundred thousand rating on the Barracuda
pro so there are some advantages to
getting the iron wolf Pro over the
Barracuda Pro but it does command a
slight premium with the prices but what
we've got here at 14 terabytes 5-year
warranty which is very solid and also a
two year data recovery service warranty
- included if you register the product
online so Seagate are definitely coming
in with a capacity sort of pitch here
with this hard drive it's hitting all
the numbers that I'd expect from a hard
drive it's actually impressed me more so
than I would expect the hard drive
speeds are quite fast so that's about it
really when it came down to the
sequential read and writes that were
very solid all the other numbers were
solid the temperatures are really good -
both in the software and the
thermal-imaging camera and the noise as
well is very quiet except the occasional
sort of spin up-and-down sound that hard
drives make which every single hard
drive makes so yes you're gonna have to
put up with that unless you want to go
on SSD and there's no 14 terabyte SSDs
out there and if there was that'd be
very very expensive you'd have to
mortgage your house to get one and we
guys hope you enjoyed today's video if
you did then be sure to hit that like
button and let me know in the comment
section below what you think of 14
terabytes and actually what would you do
with 14 terabytes loved or any thoughts
and opinions as always and I'll catch
you in the next Tech video very soon
peace out for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
