revealed and are going to be honest with
you guys I'm disappointed let's find out
why ladies gentlemen welcome back to
check yet city this is bryan coming to
you guys today with a quick discussion
on the gtx 1070 and why i may consider
not buying one at all even though i was
so eager in the upcoming weeks to this
video to buy one now the main metric
we're going to be looking at today is
the cuda cores which in an nvidia
graphics card is essentially the heart
and soul of the GPU you could call it
somewhat what an engine is too a car
it's the main driver of performance now
the gtx 1070 we're only going to get
1920 cuda cores as opposed to the gtx
1080 which is sporting 2560 cuticles in
other words it's got thirty-three
percent more kuta cause this time around
now if we contrast out to previous
generations of nvidia graphics cards we
can see that the gtx 670 sported 1344
cuda cores versus the gtx 680 which
fought in 1536 in other words we had a
fourteen percent increase in cuda cores
and that wasn't in the different league
when we look at the gtx 970 which had
sixteen hundred and sixty-four cuda
cores versus the gtx 980 we could see
that they had 2048 in other words that
had a 24 and a half percent increase in
cuda cores okay it was a bigger gap than
the gtx 670 to the 680 but it still
method the gtx 970 was still in the same
league as the 980 after you started
overclocking it and applying some tweaks
not to mention it had the same type of
memory on board and now finally looking
at this generation of graphics card to
be released we got the gtx 1080 which is
already sporting some pretty impressive
figures out of the box there were the
gtx 1070 sporting some significantly
lower core counts there i have my
concerns on how this card will actually
perform in the real world this time
around is it going to be a true sister
card in my opinion no it's going to be
in a lower tier performance bracket than
the gtx 1080 which is kind of
disappointing for a price performance
enthusiasts like myself which is always
looked forward to buying those younger
sister cards now you may be stopping me
there and saying brain but this card is
coming in at a much lower price point
than the gtx 1080 and yes that is true
though if we look at the relative price
performance premium that you're going to
be paying with this gravis card we could
see that the price performance premium
only 18 point eight percent that is
after we add the difference in price
there and equate the difference in
critical as we can see that we're
praying in eighteen point eight percent
premium for that GT x 1080 performance
not to mention it has gddr5 x though
comparing that to the previous
generation 989 70 we can see that the
980 although it only had twenty four
point five percent more criticals its
forded a massive thirty-four percent
increase in relative price performance
not to mention it carried the same type
of memory so coming out of this I'm a
little bit confused as what I'm going to
do on launch day I was going to buy a
GTX 1070 but since and video or nerfing
the sister card that damn much I don't
know what I'm going to do now and I
don't know if I'm even going to buy a
GTX 1080 since the price gouging in
Japan is going to be quite high I'd love
to hear your thoughts and opinions on
this and what you guys think of
enthusiasts and drop a comma in the
comment section below and also if you
like this video please get a big thumbs
up and I'll catch you in the next tag
video very soon peace out for now Bay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
