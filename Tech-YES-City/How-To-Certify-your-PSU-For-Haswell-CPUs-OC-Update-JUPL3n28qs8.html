city's baronies you coming back to you
guys today with a quick video on how to
certify your power supply for haswell
now when Haswell came out there's this
whole big thing around the internet that
you may need a new power supply for
haswell and that's a complete load of
crap you do not need a new power supply
especially if your power play is a
really expensive power supply that is
still running fine now the whole worry
with this whole thing was that there's
two power states with Haswell the c6 and
c7 states which are the hibernation
states and I'll show you how to disable
that later these see states basically
when when there's CPU the haswell cpu
goes into these sleep states or these
hibernation states it draws point zero
five amps as opposed to the previous
generation which is the ivy bridge cpus
they only drew point five amps now the
big worry was that some power supplies
may not be able to supply such subtle
voltages and I'm here to see if you guys
are desktop users like me you can just
disable hibernation and free up some
space on your hard drive as well if
you're a SSD as well for me it's
precious space so let's get on to it I'm
going to quickly show you guys how to
disable hibernation if you didn't
already know I'm also after that I'm
going to quickly talk to you guys and
give you guys an update on my house well
CPU and however clock in going from me
at the moment so once you're in Windows
all you have to do is go down to the
bottom left ear click on the Start menu
and then just type in here command you
can also type in CMD as well that should
bring it up as well and just go to this
little friend here command prompt right
click on that click run as administrator
and then click yes and now we should be
here and also we have to do is type in
power CFG /h I mean sorry hyphen H and
then off and then hit enter and that
will turn off hibernation it will also
free up space on your C Drive so if your
C Drive is an SSD you're going to get 75
percent of your RAM space back so for me
that's 12 gigabytes of SSD space so it
really does help personally I also
disable sleep states as well so you can
do that if you go into power options as
well personally I just you know if I'm
letting my computer rest I just turn it
off and turn it back on it takes like
five seconds if you have an S
d so that's my person that's my personal
preferences and congratulations after
you've done that your house well CPU is
now your as well power players now has
well certified so there you go guys if
you like this video please give it a
thumbs up and if you have any questions
please leave a comment the comment
section below also I'm going to quickly
say that I am NOT very pleased with
Haswell this time around there's a lot
more variables involved in over clocking
these things and the stability is very
questionable I'm een I can run my
computer at 4.4 4.6 for literally 10
hours on a stress test and then
something simple like using skype like
not like gaming's fine as well I can
stress test I can render videos game but
then when I'm on the desktop checking
email using skype it crashes it's
completely a really have to get to the
bottom of it I believe it's the memory
the CPU doesn't like even any changed
clocks on the memory like even 1866 it
crashes so I'm testing that at the
moment guys I got I'm going to bring out
a full thorough detailed Haswell
overclocking tutorial as well in the
meantime i will recommend ivy bridge
over has well if you if especially if
it's your first build specially if it's
the first rig i mean this yeah IV was so
easy as so user-friendly or geodude was
bash in the overclock bashing the
voltage bashing your RAM clocks and it
pretty much all worked so has well I'm
going to say that Intel are really not
making a fan favorite in the enthusiast
market you know they they knew as
enthusiasts that we wanted the you know
the heat spreader soldered to the die
but they just ignored us they put a
voltage regulator in that it just
creates more heat and not only that
there's a lot more variance in has well
as well not only and I'm finding it's
not just with the clocks my CPU can get
up to four point eight that's fine but
what I'm finding is there's lots of
variance in the memory controllers as
well the IMC's some people can get
really high Ram clock some people can't
so I'm really just yeah I'm finding
there's a lot of variants which
generally if you have a lot of variance
in a product it generally points to poor
quality or poor quality control anyway
guys I hope you enjoyed this little rant
on Intel I mean
yeah they've really sort of you know my
in the respect to me to my respect was
about halfway and so it's pretty much on
zero now so with as well I mean yeah I
mean the motherboard manufacturers are
really carrying this generation of Intel
so the z87 motherboard manufacturers
deserve a big kudos for sort of giving
the nice features on the motherboards
yes peace out for now come back to you
guys videos as you saw in the previous
of the style video I had the liquid pro
there I'm going to be testing out all
sorts of tests coming in the next month
definitely a very intricate very
detailed test very good thorough reviews
coming for you guys and I'll get them
done as soon as I can anyway I speed up
now mate</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
