comparing the g3 this little guy versus
the razor abysus this little guy now
straight away looking at them you can
virtually see that they're the same size
pretty much like are almost identical
it's scary the scary how much like the
size of the things are just both almost
identical you know I mean holding them
up like that you can just see like
they're almost identical in size I mean
so there we go so sighs I mean sighs
comparing them side size-wise they're
both practically the same next
comparison would be which feels the best
to hold in your hands we feel both of
them and they feel virtually the same
like the grip is the same because the
size is practically the same so size and
grip is virtually the same on both these
Mouse's now this is where this is where
a difference separator
I like the Logitech scored it's a lot
stronger and durable I think then the
razor's cheap little one so the next
point is the Logitech weighs 80 87 grams
so I did weigh it on my little scales so
the Logitech weighs about 87 grams and
this little guy weigh is about 66 grams
so the logic Tech's got that little bit
extra weight and it does matter it
really like you can feel the difference
if you hold these two mouths you can
feel the difference between the two I
mean the Logitech just has that that
good solid weight and I guess the
another thing about the Logitech G 3 is
that it feels fantastic like it's solid
like it's in really like I could
probably crunch this mouse and it
in a won't budge you know like it just
it's it feels really solid so this one
here you know if I'm not afraid if I
crush it I could you know crush it with
my hands it feels a bit cheap you know
so I'm not gonna really compare the
Logitech has these two buttons because I
mean I if you're buying the razor you
already know that doesn't have those two
buttons so that's really not a not a
real big thing in my books because when
you're playing your RTS games you don't
really use these two buttons anyway so
you know it's strictly for RTS and what
you're gonna use this mouse for gaming
right so the next thing is the click on
the Logitech is fantastic I love the
logic Tech's click it's it's really like
crunchy and you just hit it and you know
you're clicking as opposed to the razor
you click that and it kind of feels like
you've got a bit of cushion there so I'd
prefer the Logitech's click over the
razors and tracking they're both as
accurate as each other I mean yeah that
I mean they're both accurate they've
both got this you know 2000 dpi which is
all I need for a 1080p monitor so dpi
wise they match up the same hurts wise
they both got a thousand Hertz polling
so they both got the same response time
however if you did have a 30-inch
monitor you probably might want to get
this because it's got three and a half
thousand dpi as opposed to the g3 maxes
out at two thousand dpi lastly I mean I
can't really like don't know what else
to save it basically I prefer the g3
it's a solid mouse and the click is
really nice on it and it's no frills I
think I'm one who doesn't really prefer
these fancy lights because I mean just a
waste of power anyway and and I'm not
really a fanboy of all those fancy
lights on your computer so the Logitech
G 3 is just quality and then you pick it
up it can tell it's a quality gaming
mouse the razor feels like they're kind
of skimped on the weight and the click
it's kind of like a cushiony click that
I can see and probably the way I game I
click pretty you know like hard and kind
of bash it I can see this click wearing
out and probably a year or so so yeah so
basically sum it up Logitech they both
have the same size click on the Logitech
I think is better the weight on the
logitech's better and the cord on the
Logitech is better sensor wise I can't
really distinguish the difference
yeah the senses are both practically the
same so yeah overall I prefer the logic
the Logitech G 3 so leave any comments
guys if you got any comments I'm not a
fanboy of either I'm just giving you my
honest opinion so that's it guys thanks
and just leave any comments and I'll
