comparing the g3 this little guy this is
the razer abyssus this little guy now
straight away looking at them you can
virtually see that there are the same
size pretty much like I almost identical
it's scary the scary how much like the
size of the things are just both almost
identical you know sir I mean holding
them up like that you can just see like
they're almost identical in size I mean
so there we go so sighs I mean sighs
comparing them side size-wise that both
practically the same next comparison
would be which feels the best to hold in
your hands so we feel both of them and
they feel virtually the same like the
grip is the same because the size is
practically the same so sighs and grip
is virtually the same on both these
Mouse's now this is where this is where
different separator I like the Logitech
scored it's a lot stronger and durable I
think then the razors cheap little one
so the next point is the Logitech weighs
eighty eighty seven grams so I did way
it on my little scales so the Logitech
weighs about eighty seven grams and this
little guy way is about sixty six grams
so the logic tax got that little bit
extra weight and it does matter it
really like you can feel the difference
if you hold these two mouths you can
feel the difference between the two I
mean the Logitech just has that that
good solid weight and I guess the
another thing about the Logitech G 3 is
that it feels fantastic like it's solid
like it's in really like I could
probably crunch this mouse and
in a won't budge and I like it just it's
it feels really solid so this one here
you know if I'm not afraid if I crush it
I could you know crush it with my hands
it feels a bit cheap you know so I'm not
going to really compare the logitech has
these two buttons because I mean I if
you're buying the razor you already know
that doesn't have those two buttons so
that's really not a not a real big thing
in my books because when you're playing
your RTS games the you don't really use
these two buttons anyway so you know
it's strictly for RTS and what you're
going to use this mouse for gaming right
so the next thing is the click on the
Logitech is fantastic i love the
logitech's click it's it's really like
crunchy and you just hit it and you know
you're clicking as opposed to the razor
you click that and it kind of feels like
you've got a bit of cushion there so I'd
prefer the Logitech's click over the
razors and tracking they're both as
accurate as each other I mean yeah that
mean they're both accurate they've both
got this you know two thousand GPI which
is all I need for a 1080p monitor so DPI
wise they match up the same hurts wise
they both got a thousand Hertz polling
so they both got the same response time
however if you did have a 30-inch
monitor you probably might want to get
this because it's got three and a half
thousand DPR as opposed to the g three
maxes out of two thousand DPI
lastly i mean i can't really like don't
know what else to save it basically i
prefer the g3 it's a solid mouse and the
click is really nice on it and it's no
frills i think i'm one who doesn't
really prefer these fancy lights because
I mean just a waste of power anyway and
I'm not really a fan boy of all those
fancy lights on your computer so the
Logitech G 3 is just quality and then
you pick it up it can tell it's a
quality gaming mouse so the razor feels
like they're kind of skimped on the
weight and the click is kind of like a
cushiony click that I can see and
probably the way I game i click pretty
you know like hard and kind of bash it I
can see this click wearing out and
probably a year or so so yeah so
basically sum it up logitech they both
have the same size click on the logitech
i think is better the weight on the
logitech's better and the cord on the
logitech is better sensor wise i can't
really distinguish the difference yeah
the senses are both practically the same
so yeah overall I prefer the logic the
Logitech G 3 so leave any comments guys
if you got new comments I'm not a fanboy
of either I'm just giving you my honest
opinion sir that's it guys thanks and
just leave any comments and i'll reply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
